I was sitting here at my desk like I
always do tapping away clacking away on
the keyboard
do-do-do-do-do working in stuff and I
happen to look over at my x99 test bed
right here and look at this look the
tubing the tubing has come detached from
the pump it's very scary I was very
scared upon upon first sight of this but
luckily amazingly there's been no water
damage whatsoever or at least it looks
that way it's completely dry all around
the point is here is that this is a
terrible spot for a testbed or any
computer for that matter just sitting on
a chair it's not even plugged in or
anything but still I mean just check
this out
open the door it's just I mean this
thing's just getting banged all the time
all day
granted it's it's banging the chair leg
right here but still it's it's not it's
not pretty it's no place for a PC and it
was originally going to go right here
the test bed was but as you can see here
it's a since then been occupied by the
two half stackers which I built recently
if you haven't seen the video for that
you can go ahead and check that out it's
pretty epic but yeah this is a half
stack er area now so there's no
designated spot for the xi9 test bed I
feel so bad for him especially now that
he's getting all screwed up um I was
gonna have it here possibly but that's
not no longer an option because it's
been taken over by this shelf of
products that I have and so my last
resort
well actually I was like whoa maybe with
movie.i she doing this little nook right
here but I was like no I need the Nook I
need the Nook because it has all my
filming equipment and stuff and I like
putting my lights here and of course I
don't want to block the AC because it
gets hot in here but so my last resort
was the closet I scratched my head and I
thought to myself could this work and at
first I was like what if I take out both
of the doors and I'll just have this
entire wall right here to put like a
large work desk for the test bed and
stuff and I was and I like talked to my
grandpa and he was kind of concerned
about removing the doors and what are we
gonna do with them so I was like I got
to leave the doors in and maybe I'll
just get a super tiny small solo desk
right here with maybe like a little
shelf on the bottom for the test bed and
just and just try to cram everything in
there so I bought a desk that's the desk
right there in fact if you want to see
it you might have caught it earlier see
I planned ahead
that's the desk right there I bought on
it on Amazon for forty forty seven
dollars so hopefully it doesn't collapse
on me the moment I put any weight on it
but it was affordable I couldn't resist
it's gotta it's got a four star rating
not bad so today I am just gonna die no
this is super vlog II so forgive me if
you're not into vlogs but today I'm just
gonna film myself building this desk and
cleaning out all the crap in my closet I
guess there's not too much crap but
there is some stuff
they need to find another place for and
I'm going to put the desk in here and
see how it works as a little mini test
bed set up for my poor are we already
destroyed x99 test bed so you hear that
little guy we're gonna find it home for
you he excited about that yes I am mr.
Kyle
you
all right so the desk is all built now
it got put together pretty easily and
it's in the closet it fits it's a nice
fit actually there's there's room on
both sides for extra cabling or if I
just need some room to get back there
for whatever reason it's also housing
the the k70 keyboard it's not the RGB
just the regular case 70 but I
definitely needed a 10 keep number pad
since this is going to be a benchmarking
station as well as the rocket tie on in
case you're interested and that is the
4k monoprice monitor that some of you
guys were suggesting I am going to do a
review on this very soon so stay tuned
for that
it's 28 inch so it fits that 28 inch
monitor just perfectly just perfectly
and since it is 4k I probably won't need
a second monitor for extra real estate
we've got plenty enough as it is but not
all is good not all is good news for
this video I actually took the Kelvin
t12 cooler off of my x99 test bed and as
you can see let me see if I can get some
more light here there is quite a bit of
water damage you can see right there on
the top left or on the top right and the
top left kind of pretty much everywhere
is just some some heavy water damage and
the CPU didn't make it out clean either
look at that
oh it just kills me kills me so this is
really bad and really unfortunate
because I had been waiting for so long
to get this test bed up and running I
finally was like so close
I like all I had to do is install
windows and then this happens
so ah it's it's a real bummer huh I
taking a closer look at at the cooler
itself I mean it doesn't seem to be like
there was any trauma so to speak as far
as like why this tubing got detached
from its fitting right here where it
connects to the pump
there's there's no torn or ripped rubber
as far as I can tell it's kind of hard
to see cuz the metal casings right
around there but it just looks like it
just popped off naturally just with
excessive force and I think the reason
why is because there is no mounting spot
there's no
mounts for any kind of cooler on the TC
the PCT 16 so the this Kelvin t12 cooler
was literally just hanging not hanging
but it was like resting right next to
this this testbed setup so if anyone
were to just come and like try to move
it and pick it up like this by the
handle and and they weren't aware of the
cooler the cooler would just be dangling
by its own weight and I think maybe at
some point I don't know if maybe my
grandparents tried to move it I really
have no idea but whoever it is please
come forward for this atrocity you've
committed I don't know I really don't
know what to think right now I'm just so
bummed that that I probably lost about
eight to nine hundred dollars worth of
hardware and just in what in one day
which is very tragic so this is why you
guys need to buy t-shirts um yeah
stuff like stuff like this is when a
little extra side change can really help
me out with the channel and and continue
making videos for you guys but I'm sorry
for ending this this video on kind of a
somber note but stay tuned there will be
more videos when we come to turn the
camera around here stay tuned for more
stuff there's a lot of more content
coming soon like I said review of this
4k monitor coming right at you and bunch
of other cool stuff that I have going on
in the future I'm not gonna reveal too
much but it will be fun
trust me um so let me like subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already let
me know what you guys think of my little
testbed setup you know what actually
looking at it now sorry to drag on but I
don't know if I like having the testbed
down here just because it might get
kicked um extra paranoid now that now
that this whole fiasco happened so what
I'm thinking is maybe I will slide maybe
I'll get another little table just a
little table for the testbed itself over
here by the AC so it's not taking up the
whole nook but maybe just a little stand
for the testbed just have like a longer
DisplayPort cable or whatever it is
running to the monitor I don't know
eleven yet let me know you guys think
what would you do where would you put
this test bed in my room if you had to
conserve as much space and you couldn't
really move too much around I don't let
me know that's all that's gonna do for
now guys thank you guys so much for
watching thanks for your support and
stay tuned to the next one
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
