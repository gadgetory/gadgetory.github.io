father-in-law was kind enough to let me
borrow his new phantom 3 professional
drone from DJI yes he's a very brave man
as most of you know if you're watching
this around the time of upload chances
are I'm still on my honeymoon in
Thailand and the last few videos I've
posted including this one had to be shot
and edited before I left the States so
in the interest of time this is
admittedly going to be a quick and dirty
overview accompanied by some footage I
captured with the drones built-in 4k
camera so diving right in the phantom 3
Pro can travel up to 35 miles per hour
and has a max range from the controller
of 3.1 miles when FCC compliant pilots
can expect around 20 minutes of flight
time with the included battery which
only takes one hour to fully charge
though I'd recommend picking up a spare
battery or two for uninterrupted flight
I'm a Sony Exmor sensor lets the camera
shoot 720 and 1080 at 60 frames per
second or 4k at 30fps and is capable of
taking 12 megapixel stills you get an
ISO up to 3200 for video and 1600 for
photo video playback is smooth thanks to
the 3 axis gimbal with a controllable
pitch range of negative 90 to 30 degrees
the sensor really turns out a crisp and
beautiful image that makes pretty much
any landscape look breathtaking though a
bit of work can be done with image
stabilization when making quick pants
but it just captured - an included 16
gig microSD card
that's expandable up to 64 gigs and if
you don't have a card reader you can
transfer your footage to your computer
using the drones micro USB port the
controller sports a built-in
rechargeable battery and features
onboard controls for camera movement
recording videos snapping Stills and
calling your drone home which
automatically flies the Phantom back to
your takeoff point if you happen to have
an ocean moment you can even configure
height boundaries here to ensure the
drone doesn't hit anything on its way
back to you
additional safety features will
automatically return the drone home if
it loses connection with your remote or
if the intelligent flight battery is
running low the thing is practically
idiot-proof and that's probably the only
reason why my father-in-law left it in
my hands rather than flying blindly you
can dock your Android or iOS mobile
device onto the controller and use the
DJI app for a live HD view of
phantom threes camera this with the aid
of built-in GPS and a mini-map on screen
make for an immersive experience while
keeping your bearings well this is DJ
eyes flagship professional model you
don't need to be a seasoned drone pilot
to take flight the controls here are
super tight and responsive and the
drones impeccable resilience to drag and
win resistance make flying an effortless
activity for pros and newbies alike from
takeoff to landing I had a ton of fun
flying this thing so special thanks
again to my father-in-law for letting me
borrow it to reiterate this really only
scratches the surface of all this drone
is capable of so I've left some links in
the description below if you want to do
some more digging but that's pretty much
gonna do it for now guys feel free to
leave me some love in the comments down
below before you go and toss me a like
on this video if you enjoyed it as
always I'm Kyle awesomesauce Network
thank you guys for watching subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already that
we'll see you all in the next video

and now it's time for some bonus drone
footage
