to you by fantex and cable mod click the
links in the description below for more
info what's up guys welcome back to the
channel so one of my sponsors for CES
this year is cable mods so I told them I
would do a quick little video at my
hotel room on their new Pro line of
cables so this is a sponsored video bear
that in mind but then again I would not
be here at sea as covering all the stuff
for you guys if it weren't for them
these are actually really cool I
actually really really like these and of
course you can just break this off as
corporate chill ad or whatever but I
would use these in a personal custom
water-cooled build whereas quite frankly
their existing cables before these I
probably wouldn't I would go with like
more of an independent you know private
company but you know what these things
are actually really really nice they
stepped up their game a lot you pretty
much use the same custom configurator as
you do with their existing line of
cables but you just select the Pro
option if you want to go pro and
basically what that means is you just
have a higher quality sleeving job
everything is nice and straight in the
line the problem with existing cable
extensions is that they're often not the
wires are kind of going in different
directions sometimes a little ship to
you all bent out of shape and at that
point even with cable combs that can be
impossible to train and just really get
that nice show floor look and feel I'm
like we've seen here at CES with all the
custom builds but these ones are super
super sexy I actually made these ones in
their configurator with whyphy sauce and
you pretty much have every option there
you can choose whatever colors you want
in any pattern you choose even the
custom even the cable combs I should say
are available in three different colors
black white and silver you can kind of
see I've got all three variants right
here but overall they're just a really
really nice sleeve that are gonna be
really easy to train in any way you want
you can also basically bend them either
way to top it all off I think these
things are fairly priced for what they
are and for just how good they look
super easy to configure and order and
set up and customize to your liking
and I think cable model was pretty
justified in using the word pro in their
new line here so before my before my
voice dies any further and I forget how
to words I'm gonna cut things off here
guys so I'll leave a link in the
description below if you want to check
these out for yourself but apart from
that toss a like get subscribe so you
don't miss any more of my coverage here
at CES 2018 and I'll see you guys in
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
