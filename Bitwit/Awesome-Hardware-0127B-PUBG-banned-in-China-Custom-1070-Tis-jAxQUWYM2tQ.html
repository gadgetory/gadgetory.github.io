start at 7 o'clock at 7:06 better than
we usually do and you're giving me a
evil look and I don't like it because
it's kind of freaking me out I also
don't think this is a fair fight because
I left my sword at home ok
suddenly I'm not so scared anymore
what's up everybody welcome to side B
this is part 2 of Awesome Hardware
episode 127 well I've seen the poll and
I do every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
right here on twitch.tv slash
awesome Hardware Halloween edition and
we also stream to our respective emails
yes it is special Halloween edition
because Halloween just happens to land
on a Tuesday this year how awesome is
that do you normally think Halloween on
Tuesday how lame right but then you guys
awesome awesome part of our Halloween
edition Oh Halloween should be on
Tuesday every year yes it is a true true
story of redemption for for the holiday
of Halloween and we're glad to have you
all with us if you happen to miss the
first half of this fantabulous episode
go ahead and check it out on Paul's
channel that's youtube.com slash Paul's
Hardware or you can find a link in my
youtube video description if you're on
Twitch just stay where you are nothing
will change and you're awesome and this
is a show where we'd like to drink and
occasionally curse so if you have
sensitive ears or you have children
around please kill them or no then I say
that hide them and keep them away from
the stream kill them and continue
drinking with us because we're awesome
and other things thank you to moderate
or cell processing in chat ice as well
as spider fan thank you guys you guys
are awesome you guys are the real deal
and of course my beautiful wife wifey
sauce
Heather is in chat as well be sure to be
kind to her or she will ban you forever
and thank you guys so much for these
donations already rolling in we'll be
getting around to all of those messages
attached to those donations at the end
of this half of the episode additionally
if you guys want to support us in other
fun creative ways where you also get
something out of it that's really
awesome you can go to any of our stores
that I've got bit with tech minds bit
without tech slash store where you can
find the super cool new
awesome hardware shirts RGB everything I
just got mine today as well as the
beware of bottleneck shirt I feel a
little douchey walking around with a
shirt with my face on it but so far
people haven't seemed to notice we've
also got the amazing sword fight shirt
also awesome hardware branded from our
good friend Brian Mooar accent and a
bunch of other stuff on our sites Paul's
is Paul's hardware dotnet net and you
can pick up one of his awesome bottle
openers with the thumbscrew logo on it
they work fantastically I've had the
pleasure of using it myself available as
a set coming along with the pint glasses
that it's a great sense to drink the
beer it is a great set oh look at that
poor but it also makes me extra thirsty
I am thirsty it's very effective
marketing anyway so guys pick up
something from you of our stores from
both of our stores if you pick up
something from both of us then you will
get a double Johnson shout out at the
end of today's episode and it will be
glorious but for now we are drinking
beer I'm drinking some clown shoes the
barista it's a breakfast brown ale which
is a type of beer I've never heard of
which I practiced somewhat made up the
doesn't have eggs in it fear that goes
 bacon in here and then polish
during in the 25 year anniversary in ER
D kale which is branded by Blizzard
Blizzard Bravin also from in Anaheim
micro brewery known as bottle logic
brewing logic how is yours by the way
no I do a quick swap in Justin - it's a
five-person Hale yes tasty mmm that's
good that's really good I like yours too
yeah these are both very good Browns
they're both Browns and yeah they are
not sponsoring the shout which means
we're just drinking them because we like
them that was me brown ale um so let's
just dive right into some tech news
first starters also Paul were you going
to continue carving the pumpkin that we
started on your half and it's trying to
tweet first oh yeah you go ahead and do
that I'll just dive right in with some
of these factual's
pub Jean apparently according to PC
gamer here's where the original articles
from pub G is facing some serious
threats from China China is threatening
to ban the game in its entirety for
various reasons this is according to a
Bloomberg report via Gabe oh pardon me
didn't mean to do that via games
industry dot biz right the the games
last standing battle to the death style
design according to China presents a
deviation from the country's socialist
core values and traditional Chinese
culture and ethical norms so basically
China's looking at this game like pub G
what does this is number one streamed
video game of all time and no and by the
way China is the number one the biggest
region for pub G as far as number of
players and of player population China
is the biggest sort of audience for this
game and now the government is looking
at it all these watchdogs these Chinese
watchdogs are looking at it because I
don't know man this pub G's fight to the
death thing it seems a little against
our Terms and policies where we're
traditional we're old-school we keep we
kick it old school broke and this is a
little too new school and aggressive for
us so makes a lot of sense cow because
pub G there's always only one winner and
obviously if there's only one winner how
can I was an all-state win great things
should be done for the party right and
you know what I think I think the the
question here is is China taking it too
far
are they not able to see this as just a
game and are they seeing it more as
anything more than a game like this is a
potential threat on their their economic
system their government etc I I don't
know what the hell they're thinking over
there but there was a loose translation
from the the Chinese watchdog that they
actually said to their Chinese
developers this is this is the warning
or advice that China gave their Chinese
developers game developers and this is a
loose translation to this end I
recommend the domestic game companies
meaning all of you Deb's here in China
should not arrange or research and
develop the
production of such games like pub G and
do not advocate to test such a way to
attract users at the same time gaming
live and other platforms should not be
such games to provide publicity
promotion and other services so yes very
very broken English here basically
they're saying devs make make games that
are not like pub G that go against what
we believe as a country or what our at
least our government thinks that the
people should believe and so this is of
course a bit controversial but also if
you don't live in China this doesn't
really apply to you it just goes to show
that wow I I'm very glad that our
government you know as many problems and
issues that there are in America at
least our government hasn't tried to
like ban any triple-a titles or or
popular games yet they're pretty Lexx
with the video games
I mean GTA 5 totally fine pub G walk on
through you know I haven't I haven't
really seen like Trump or even Obama in
the past be like you know that one game
GTA 5 it's not not quite up to our
standard as American citizens I think
will ban it forever
um I haven't heard anything like that on
our end yet so that's an Obama
impression no I was trying to but I you
know I dropped it it wasn't bad I was
gonna say it wasn't that wasn't bad I
got I mean maybe a little hints and
looks like Obama notes were in that
impersonation but my beer is here okay
um so yeah shout out to China if you
guys are pub G players in China first
off you because you keep killing me
I know it's all you Chinese is all the
Chinese because every time I get killed
I just hear like someone on the other
end speaking Chinese and it's because
they're better than me and I'm really
salty so thankfully that game will be
banned for you now no I'm totally joking
that does suck no video games should
ever be banned for anything unless
they're like completely horrible which
pub G is not IMO let's move on to our
next story and how far have you gotten
what's your progress here on the on the
pumpkin-carving but I've just plunged my
knife in
maybe by the end of this show Paul will
have carved out an eye or something like
that
you only decided what I want to go pours
okay so next up we've got this an
article from video cards calm about an
asus video car this is there ROG Strix
gtx 980ti assassin's creed origins
edition what look at that this is a car
that they actually built in
collaboration with Ubisoft which means
from what I can infer that the card will
ship mostly broken and capped at 30 fps
yes that was my that was my LS Weekend
Update joke of the day but here's what
you should out of what you should know
about it apart from what I just
mentioned it's brandon gold and looks
kind of weird it's got a back plate just
watching chat go crazy oh yes it's got
hieroglyphs on the back plate which is a
love or hate affair this whole card is
love or hate your they're gonna be like
oh my god I can I can form the perfect I
know the perfect color scheme and I can
finally use copper tubing for my custom
open this card gray with copper tubing
right so in that regard it's like a
godsend for some modders or whatever I'm
sure other people are gonna be like
there's no way that this is gonna match
with the typical red green blue or black
or whatever I have in my system so
doesn't doesn't even go with this black
with RGB it doesn't match with RGB at
all
so yeah it's got the same clock speed or
no I'm sorry the same clocks as the RG
Strix OSI model slightly lower than the
Poseidon but still in that 1.7 gigahertz
range and it's got five video out studio
I - display ports and two HDMI 2.0 it
includes the AC origins game so
Assassin's Creed origins actually comes
included with this game
I love the top comment of this article
it's like had Ubisoft optimize the game
properly they could have bundled it with
the gtx 1070 but yeah so guys let me
know what you think of this
love it hate it don't really care for it
I don't know I don't know it's got dual
8-pin connectors as you might expect 12
+ 2 phase power design and yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
all right cool let's move on to the next
door here a G scale is launching or has
launched their fastest s odom kit to
date whoo you guys might have seen this
on LT T's Twitter accounts they recently
posted a picture of the asrock x2 99e
ITX motherboard with 64 gigs of this
 installed damn them as well as a 78
no 79 80 X Z processors of the 18 core
the flagship skylake X and the they even
had the the bits power mono block on top
of that looks just that attaining the
quad channel memory makes it to me a
much more viable option than their x99
ITX option of course that was the one of
the major complaints with with the
previous generation of high-end desktop
platform from Intel but now they've seen
to rent remedy that and g.skill is
stepping up to the plate delivering some
really fast and high performance memory
on the S ode inside of things because as
I mentioned these really sort of niche
motherboards high-end motherboards that
are mini ITX are only som compatible
such as the asrock x2 99e ITX so the kit
that were we're talking about here is a
32 gig kit that's for 8 gig sticks at
3800 megahertz that's really fast 3800
for a kit like this at one point three
five volts timings it grabbers timings
Tony's our Paul Paul is not amused
Paul is seriously unimpressed you are a
as a reviewer we are jaded AF you know
so there are three slower kits to follow
including a four by sixteen gigabyte kit
at 3200 so yeah yep
good lord and these are all using
samsung VI ddr4 ICS so that's
especially because Verizon seems to play
nicely with the Samsung B dice for my
experience so that's great news
and then this is supposed to launch
December of this year unless you're
Linus then you get it early with
hopefully more s odom compatible boards
to follow because as far as I know
current gen that as truck board is the
only one that can take this kit yeah so
cool making some headway in the in the
RAM game g.skill is all right let's move
on to our next article which is actually
about me because I'm awesome this is a
story just a touch of shameless
self-promotion absolutely
this is actually an article or a video I
should say originally from gamers Nexus
so that here's the deal guys a lot of
you guys probably caught my enthu alley
build part one where I'm building a
10,000 around a 10,000 dollar system for
shit's and gigs and I'm gonna benchmark
it do lots of testing but obviously I
was gonna delete it because why not it's
$10,000 you might as well deal in that
79 80 XE get hands-on the living
experience is something that I wouldn't
pass up if I had the opportunity well
you know what Paul I'm just so confident
in gamers nexuses abilities that I'm
like okay they can be led this thing a
thousand times better than I can
then either of us can to beyond then
those people can all right other than
maybe der Bauer alright he's probably
got the only one with a leg up here
so I actually shipped my 79 80 XE last
week to gamers Nexus and they did a
bunch of benchmarks with it and they
actually dealer did it for me and
reapplied some liquid metal or apply
some liquid metal to the to the actual
to the dye and resealed it and they had
some interesting conclusions they made a
video on it themselves the thumbnail
says d-lighting kyle to be clear they
did not actually delayed me as a person
I'm not sure how that would work but
they found some interesting some
interesting behavior actually the vrm on
the motherboard they were using was
spiking up way too hot and it was
actually throttling the cpu making it
bounce between 45 X which was their set
multiplier to all the way down to 12
it was just going up and down and that
was with both the the thermal stock Tim
and the liquid metal the difference is
that with the stock Tim the CPU was
hitting t.j.maxx so any to the untrained
eye it looked like well the CPU is just
getting really hot and that's why it's
throttling but with the liquid metal the
CPU package temps were still under
t.j.maxx yet the multiplier was still
throttling down to 12x so gamers Nexus
and Steve immediately knew that
something else was wrong and that's why
they invented their super scientific
finger burn test where they put their
finger on the vrm and to see it to see
if it if it burns them if it's if it's
too hot to touch that's and it burns
them within three or so seconds then
they know that the vrm is just running
too hot and so what they did was they
took a fan like just an external case
fan I'm guessing and just blasted the
vrm with it on the motherboard and
suddenly there was no throttling they
were able to hit that 45 X stable no
problem so their advice to me was hey
Kyle even though we've deleted the CPU I
would still suggest if you're using next
to minute or one of these motherboards I
believe the one that they use is the
same one that I am the rampage 6 extreme
asus rog board which is lame because
it's like a 650 dollars where you did an
unboxing at $650 board and still running
into overheating issues on the vrm and
so Steve was like Kyle if you're gonna
build this system and actually use it
long term maybe invest in a model
blogger look look into a full-coverage
water block for your CPU and the MOSFETs
you know etc so you don't have to see we
actually maximize the potential of this
chip Intel it's Intel giving water
coolers the opportunity to say yes this
water cooling equipment that I have
invested you know hundreds if not
thousands confidence into is actually
doing me some good I'm able to maintain
a higher long-term overclock that I
wouldn't have been able to do it mm-hmm
so guys the because of all this because
of these finding these great findings
that Steve and gamers Nexus of
it's actually gonna delay perhaps delay
the part two of the enthu a leak go
because I'm trying now I'm trying to
actually get or require a monoblock 4x
to 99 specifically for the rampage 6
extreme which EK water blocks does have
they just released a brand new mono
block for that
so guys ek if you're watching this
please please send me one and any
viewers in chat right now have their
email go go blow up I know I do
they haven't replied to me yet maybe
they hate me but yes that would be super
cool if I can get one of those or if not
I'll just probably buy it myself it's
because all your fan texts well what is
EK have anything against fan o because
it's big applause yes but I'm willing to
swap out but see the cool thing about
fan tax is that they're just so there's
such cool guys they're like hey Kyle
like we'd love to send you some water
blocks you know from our from our own
line or glacier series but you know if
you want to use other blocks that's cool
too like no other vendors that cool
appendices that's why I work with them
so much is because we're just so chill
they're like any or whatever it's your
build
so ek if you guys are down to support
I'd love to have your water block on
that 79 80 X II which is now deleted it
should be in the mail by now and I'll be
getting it any day so super exciting
stuff and huge shout out to Steve so
they told you they seem like a core III
send it right back to you it's like 80
350 K or something this doesn't even fit
in the socket guys no but the other cool
thing about their testing was that they
found by applying liquid metal and doing
a light seal on on the CPU with with the
silicone they had they actually saw a 12
degree reduction from the stock Tim
which is great especially not just
because for thermals but for every 10
degree Celsius and this is what they
found
in previous videos they posted for every
10 degree Celsius knocked off you get
about a 4 percent power reduction in
consumption so that's great too so a lot
of cool a lot of cool stuff a lot of
good findings over a gamer's nexus go
ahead and check them out if you haven't
yet moving on to our next article though
we've got
just a quick quick roundup from WCF tech
of some custom gtx 1070 TI's these are
all ad and board models I'm not going to
go over all of them but you guys can
look through them on your own time
there's some pretty cool ones though
I'll mention a few of them the asus suri
a barrister beerus Cerberus the Asus
Cerberus these are all 1070 TI's this is
the advanced looks like a new cooler
design that I have not seen before it's
got a dual fan sort of duel fans config
and it's pretty cool I don't see any
strict branding on that either nope it
does not say it's Trix MSI also has
their titanium gaming which looks
exactly like their regular gaming cards
except instead of red which is very
iconic for MSI cards it's titanium slash
silver so maybe a bit more color neutral
but it looks pretty cool the MSI duke is
more of a budget option it seems triple
fan design the EVGA for the win -
they're gonna go for the win - and I'm
not lining up the pictures I'm showing
what you're saying that's ok the old
that they can make him look it up on
their own is told on Asus there's the
Cerberus yeah the Cerberus or whatever I
was there's the MSI actually like every
MSI yep MSI a new design I know what a
bad design why and it's red and red yeah
but so this one's a little bit like I
was saying a little bit more color
neutral silverish or gray whatever you
want to call it not there and the LEDs
are red or I'm sorry white and not red
that was the thing that annoyed me most
about that card though is that you could
only or was that was that was RGB for
part of it but then a bunch of other red
light with the cooler yeah yeah exactly
the fixed red lights and just the red
cooler itself the so tech crew has a
mini card coming out so if you were
looking for a small form-factor solution
that might be the way to go and EVGA
again has their 401 2 and their SC
hybrid which will have a 120 millimeter
radiator attached built-in ai oh that's
pretty cool yeah 1070 TI performance
embargo
Oh lifts sweats like early in the
morning for on Wednesday it's like today
oh no Thursday Thursday better not you
Wednesday I am gonna do a video it's
probably gonna be not like the other
videos that will go up you yeah I don't
know what I'm gonna do yet whatever I do
I'm doing tomorrow let's just put it
down mm-hmm
although I will be I will be using the I
confirm this today I will be using this
otech mini version this little version
something 8.5 inches long but just
exactly the same size and shape is their
mini its 1070 same freaking thing but
anyway it is very tiny one that this is
what's going into my HG PC or no no the
what ended up being the entry-level the
videostar going to go tomorrow on this
the entry-level thread refer bill that I
did okay that's also going to be the
system that is up for a donation
giveaway for our thing cool is it a mini
ATX system no but it's a little bit
smaller it's and it's in the the fractal
mesh if I see okay and a ten-point
because I have the inner max thread
ripper water cooler in there at the
front front just a pretty decently thick
radiator and Japan's clearance to ten
point right now I have the stock 1070 Ti
and then the the founders Edition which
is ten and a half inches long
mm-hmm and it barely fits right so
basically I was talking to ZOTAC and I
was like I need something that's 10 1/2
inches there cards are 11 inches they're
bigger ones so he's like gonna send me
the short one yourself nice should be
still plenty of room in there excellent
and that's pretty much it for the tech
news for my half but we've still got
some more stuff to talk about here let's
do some Pitt my PC but believe we've got
five entries here that I selected and an
honorable mention at the end and we'll
do some we'll do a quick a quick review
of some of the costumes that you guys
also tweeted at me
today but starting with a jack and his
PC let's take a look here and I just saw
gamers Nexus made a donation with the
comment attached which we will I'm very
anxious to read see what that's all
about yep let's see what that's all
about
mmm Wow they gave you a lot of money up
to no good as usual up to no good all
right so what do we got here um er poem
white looks like an M to Lux to me with
hmm an RGB strip that seems to be
hanging on for dear life or lack thereof
an interesting mounting solution for the
CPU cooler going vertically let's see
what card is that also the graphics he
heard which doesn't look like he's
giving us oh he did give us specs oh I'm
sorry that's an MSI Radeon r7 370 I was
right on the case he's also gotten 8300
AMD FX 8350
the entire platform you might be able to
sell that whole platform motherboard RAM
and CPU and try to get like I don't know
Rison 5 or something like that
Rison 5 1600 I would think would be a
pretty nice upgrade from an ad from it
from an FX 8300
your GPU looks pretty good unless you're
trying to go for 1440p I'd say for 1080p
gaming you're probably ok unless you
really want to crank up the eye-candy
then opt for I don't know it's hard it's
hard right now to suggest day
did you already carve that yeah what did
you carve you did do a penis
you did do a penis Paul is this is this
intentional to this little yeah it's
kind of
Wow some rudimentary but Wow that that
is the scariest pumpkin I have ever seen
I like bull camels its 10.5 inches did
you measure so this is a a one-to-one
scale SEC of Paul Paul's hardware my
one-to-one scale of Paul's hardware
everyone applause circle of circle of
applause round of applause everyone
thank you very impressive carving I will
say never never bring a knife that close
to your real hardware though for the
sake of all of us all right let's take a
look at this PC here I think you have a
fantastic looking system I don't see
much wrong with it cable management
looks mostly on point there's something
that could be done maybe at the top
looks kind of like they're hanging down
a little low certain areas extensions
for your twenty four and eight pin but
not for the graphics card yeah it's a
little inconsistent yeah cleaning that
up what would make things worse and
white get some white power cables for
your GPU and white power white mmm yep
says that I never nail 2017 white power
tonight that's not something I it's not
no so also the ready in your GPU looks a
little mismatched to the LED color that
you have picked out there unless you
know get that new titanium one that we
just show you the titanium it'll match
perfectly with your heatsink on the CPU
cooler and everything else will be
perfectly fine honestly though it looks
pretty good there's not much I would
change so thank you for that Jack thank
you jack next up we've got Oh see me Oh
Sammy 84 if I'm pronouncing your name
incorrectly
we got a do not announce the script here
it looks like Arabic or something GTX
1066 gigabyte a core i5 6600 non-case
cue and I was looking to fine
to find our five I believe it's in our
five because it's got a cage up here
yeah doesn't have the Reds of wall yes
final five
this is actually kind of a similar
system internally as the one we just
looked at with the msi card and it is
sort of a standard cpu quota the
graphics card is in the top slots so I
have to take my hair off just just for
because and the CPU cooler is positioned
and a slightly more reasonable
configuration yeah
cable management's however feels like
Versailles it's bad bad and you should
feel bad seems like little little
attention was paid there yep um I would
definitely tuck some of those cables
behind the motherboard tray you have a
nice big grommet which you've already
started to use right next to your power
supply I would continue stuffing all the
excess cabling through that hole you
probably don't even need to do much so
the back end is in there lots of space
back thing oh yeah oh yeah let's keep
stuffing it oh yeah you'll get through
yeah
alright moving on to our next person
Patrick Patrick you stop at the beak
Maddie cake slowly with the z170
motherboard okay high five sixty six
hundred K and arms four eighty eight
gigs at three msi cards in a rope is
that really is Wow
good lord I didn't even realize that
when I was sixteen gig you see the air
for the parser LED ram and samsung 850
Evo SSD it's 150 gig okay so so if you
bought all of this stuff when z170 was a
thing and with our X 480 first launched
and 16 gigs of DDR for you should sell
your your 480 gig and your Arc's 488 gig
and sell your memory right now cuz both
of you get it up in Christ since you
bought this stuff no more to the point
though your system looks pretty clean
overall Yale management isn't the
I've ever seen yeah especially yeah so
there's maybe some work to be done there
probably can't make it look too much
nicer without a cable extension kit or
something like that but you could clean
up like some of these cables coming for
your front fans and that kind of thing
yeah honestly I think just some cable
extensions if you're really going for
aesthetics and cleaning up the wiring I
don't know if those are RGB ring fans
from thermaltake or if they're just set
into white and locked into white all
right just wait yeah this is memories
then I guess that's not too bad it's
still color neutral I take the sticker
off the power supply if you are using
the tempered glass version of that case
which I think you are actually cuz I
don't see that as I believe mounting I
believe chat is pointing this out right
now and I'll point it out to why is
there an optical drive in not plugged in
if it apparently is not even plugged in
yeah I do not know maybe yes not plugged
in that is odd that's peculiar
there is a loose SATA cable hanging
right here I don't know right
and apparently loose power cables also
hanging right there so I don't know what
the deal is with the optical drive hmm
that must be where he hides like super
hardcore porn he's just like a disc only
plugs it in when he wants to access a
second disc of like one gig of just the
best porn ever well if it's a DVD of the
four four-point-six how much is on a DVD
for eggs yeah maybe it's a blu-ray and
there's like 20 gigs on there is that
how much of blu-ray can hold depends on
if it's a single layer double layer I
think blu-ray 4.7 gigs thank you for and
capacity wait what blu-rays go up to 25
okay I was just pretty close 5000k 50
okay for 25 on a single layer for Fianna
do
oh wow directions I like when I have
very poor incapacitate and I like when I
remember things and it's actually
correct 25g with dual layers is fifty
yup
triple layer could jump over a hundred
gigs like a quadruple layers could do a
hundred and twenty eight I'm sure
there's no like you don't need a special
super niche blu-ray hard layers or
anything yeah but what do you know damn
120 gigs on a disc that's that's
impressive
all right well I've said my piece with
Patrick spelled Patrick thank you for
submitting next we've got rolld ah oh oh
all right um name thanks Colin genus
name in that case 602 I'll name that
ripoff of my arctic panther 24-pin power
cable design yeah but now what is it I
think it's a 600 T with those 200
millimeter fans to the top and the front
oh yeah the fans are dead giveaway that
was my first ever case guys so you can't
fool me on a 600 T I know and it's
definitely mine definitely a Corsair for
sure here we go
so either a 600 T or a derivative
thereof that uses the same frame
yeah which there weren't too many of in
my experience yeah and the white to
weight great it's got the white frame
around the yes yeah that's it's you know
that case holds up it's still a pretty
good case okay they the fans that
shipped with r410a crap yeah I replaced
those right so like you got some ketchup
and mustard cabling going on with what
appears to be a Zion power supply which
looks really horrible to me good lord
and you obviously have some cable
extensions because there are capable
extensions and a name I wondered yes if
you bought these cable extensions that
they cost more than that power supply
yeah right add it up yep because a
decent cable extension kit is gonna cost
30
yeah that power spudsy's bucks so yeah
really really swap that power supply up
please I doubt that's 80-plus probably
not at all and if it's even if it's like
500 watts it's probably pulling it's
probably giving you like 320 yeah max
rotate your CPU cooler here 90 degrees
so it is exhausting at the back and
working in tandem with your exhaust fan
there at the back and then again
interesting just like that the fact that
you go for this aesthetic upgrade of
these sleeves see sleeves
cables here and yet there's so much just
kind of loose like this what is this
right here there's that's not going to
anything that's just there yeah that can
be tucked like a lot of these can be
tucked back behind you get a loose kind
of cable here coming from the fan of the
CPU cooler as well it doesn't look very
tidy so cleaning those all up getting a
new power supply would make this look a
lot cleaner a lot more I could like you
like you like you thought more yeah like
you put and more investment of thought
and stuff anyway yeah thank sending
those over there rolls potential Rhoda
next is Ashwin Mehra with a define Nano
s build Asus RG Strix Z 370 - I this is
a brand new build you have the nice 780
700 not the case at least he didn't put
the cake course there's 16 gigs of DDR
for three thousand eight natt is c2 from
EVGA badly measured psu cables from
cable mod oh if they really came that
way you should send them back if you can
cuz that's not that's that's not how
we're supposed to be that's just
defective you got a defect oh all right
yeah no that's not that's not cool so
this has the vibe to it where it's like
alright if you got your power supply and
plugged in your graphics card and it
doesn't look that great you're fine
this has the unfortunate thing where
it's like snot even you obviously did
spend some time some efforts possibly
some investments on these cables and
it's really not looking good
you got some twist ties up here which
doesn't look good at all no the fact
that there are mismatched lengths for
each individual wire yeah it's going to
ruin the entire overall effect yeah
cable combs that are kind of doing their
job but not really completely also this
one does not seem to be properly routed
through the cable comb notches and these
kibble combs are also very widely spaced
which gives me the impression that maybe
they're meant to be temporary some cable
combs are meant to go on there full time
summer meant I put on there to put stuff
in their place and then you take them
off yeah and this kind of seems to me
like taking that off would maybe look
better right at least for the 24 pending
so normal so yeah yeah get your money
back
also there's a huge down here in NZXT
hue which is so this is a so yeah you
got you got some really nice hardware in
here and honestly if everything is
perfectly functional and fine and your
temps are fine then you can tell us to
go suck a lemon or whatever outdated
phrase you want to throw at us but if
you want it to look really clean you're
really going to need to spend some more
time on these cables the cable combs the
cables coming out for your graphics card
because cleaning those up and making
them nice and smooth like this would be
like oh my gosh should be such a nice
compact
yeah we're full builds all together
they're definitely those are really
destroying it everything else looks so
nice maybe roat's consider some rotation
of your fans up here some of these
cables maybe could clean up a little bit
of that yeah free LEDs but everything
else looks really clean just uh oh some
some unfortunate cable comes
implementation okay alright and that's
pretty much all for the mushrooms we
gotta have my won honorable mention will
mention from Jeju Jeju I hope this was a
nice looking build so I thought I'd
feature it inside the
wait what with cases this is a
thermaltake case I can't tell it looks
at least partially customized might be a
Thermaltake case I'm not sure but the
bends are super clean nice runs here and
it looks like we've got a dual loop
going on because I could see two
different shades of fluid unless that's
just the lighting can you tell look look
behind that reservoir is there another
reservoir behind that reservoir or is it
like a mirror I think it's a mirror cuz
I don't think there's enough enough
depth there to put both of those okay
yeah yeah maybe you're right I could be
wrong I feel like it's a mirror though
you not somebody in chat says to res I
don't it's an illusion Lila res I don't
know what to believe anymore then it
goes up to the CPU and the CPU out up to
this top read out that and back into
that res and that's that's a res pomp
then this one would go into the graphics
cards out of that into this lower
radiator and I've never all right so
maybe the race maybe there is a duel all
right I think you're right
okay look at that again yeah the loop
maybe is even the fluid in the tray back
res looks a little bit darker yeah but
and that's a cool little LCD there it's
fancy
it says white devil white devil I'm
curious about there why that's just a
random power supply out here just
chillin powering something maybe he's
it's really hot in his room and he's
just hooked up a couple fans to his BSU
he said ketchup and mustard but a very
clean build yeah very nice-looking I
like super sexy the job did you thank
you guys for submitting those and we do
have I did want to go over a couple
costumes hi guys I asked you guys
earlier today to send in some pictures
of you in costume because we would
potentially do a pimp my costume segment
but I didn't really receive enough
submissions to do a full segment on it
so at the same time I didn't want to
just
we ignore all of the good submissions
that you guys submitted so being very
repetitive now but I just wanted to
quickly highlight there are some
honorable mentions here as well so first
off we have Tim this is from his office
costume contest and he specifies that he
did not win it did not win but he showed
up to work as God's gift to women and he
is God's uh and clearly it's a present
clearly what woman argue with that
no one Tim no one you are a bright
shining star he's wearing neutral colors
otherwise yep yep he's definitely got a
big package I think that's pretty
impressive
Tim very impressive good job there we
both approve of your package Tim and
also Zach Zach went as something I
mainly picked him for the to put on the
show because I just had questions I
didn't really know exactly what he came
as I said I stared into the abyss and
the abyss stared back okay is that a
famous quote from somewhere that
immediately like reveals where I don't
know if that's a direct quote I mean it
sounds vaguely familiar but um it just
seems like you know maybe he was on some
drug binge or something like that you
know it's 3:00 a.m. he's he's you know
he's just bark dab his gourd or whatever
someone said horse of cards horse of
cards that makes sense see that makes
sense horse of cards cancelled it's
cancelled them on cards I love it this
is just what he was inspired okay to
dress up as well you know what a for
making us think yep
enjoy the drugs Thank You Zach and then
next one we got Joker not joking
productions different Joker I thought
this was an honorable mention because
the makeup is on
point I think the pretty some pretty
good pretty good makeup here and this is
this is definitely a hospital
Joker where he has the dent the Harvey
Dent badge yes and the nurse outfit very
good job on the the makeup no I got
these scars yeah I don't actually he
says he didn't get his hair right though
oh that's okay you brought your own
let's go so that patron flip the green
tint in there we can tell ya colors on
point that's the most important part
even his Twitter bio says let's put a
smile on that face yes totally in
character with nice it's much
appreciated and then finally our good
friends Steve and Carey yes Steve Steve
McGarrett they went as Daenerys
Targaryen as well as the white Walker
king of the night key or the true king
of the north
this is him and of course in his casual
wear casual attire oh yeah this is when
he's just chillin now let's get the
t-shirt here Danny give it to me baby
yep very nice
well done Steve and Carey good job Steve
thank you all I carry
thank you all for submitting it was
super awesome and we can now move on to
what candy are you eating
woofs delicious Reese's you know I
forgot can I get me a KitKat or a
whopper
I've been eating quite a few of these
either or even more will this advice
you're gonna walk her then yes okay so
let's see where do we leave off where do
we where do we pick up all these
donations from here we go zere hardy 20
Australian saw your first video Kyle oh
no which side of the motherboard to put
risers on now hahaha this must have been
I think the video he's talking about is
the new egg video it's the three first a
three-way highway speed challenge she
challenges right me Joanne and
who was it you Steve that was the no
edge you were the judge it was me
Joanne smoo vote I think through the
goods in three of us yeah but yes I did
not remember or didn't even know at that
point in my PC building career that
standoffs were a thing
so I literally just mounted the
motherboard to the case which I
eventually had to you also used tell me
about it yeah tell me you had a standoff
under and on top and you used the
standoff to screw into that side of the
motherboard to secure the motherboard in
place
I was clutching at straws a million
brilliant and I was clutching at straws
you know I'm gonna do a follow-up video
see if that actually works and prove you
all wrong
surprise it's fine all right gives the
ability to mount another motherboard on
top of it yeah you know one with all the
Bitcoin mining in these days I'm yeah
why not all right Fred rant fifty bucks
Fred you were the fridge Thank You Fred
you were the friend that I want that
I've been looking for all my life gives
me money every time you see him oh yeah
absolutely
you are the you're the best Kyle they
were still high they're still pie in
your hair oh well working with wipey
sauce for another special event for you
in two weeks
so you better hurry up and take her to
dinner okay she's I'm taking her to
frickin dinner tonight cuz I'm terrified
with what you guys are planning next it
sounds like it the best bet honestly
scared yeah thank you though right
tom-toms remember this remember seven
hundred over seven seventy seven dollars
in 77 Norwegian kroner Wow
hard to help you get in touch with
savage Turkey I'm Paul
no nice why you fast forward on my
donation about face off and Reaper way
what I fast forwarded we might have
missed that one from Mitch why I'm that
fast forward on my donation donation
about-face so perhaps maybe we skipped
your donation by accident
I didn't mean to we that was totally not
intend
but face off and reaper oh he's probably
saying that whoever loses the next
faceoff would have to like eat some of
that Carolina Reaper jerky or something
oh yeah never I'm never eating I'm never
eating the Carolina room neither of my
furniture neither mine for the record I
will neither am i unless you give me
like I will never put that in my mouth
or up my butt I can't promise that
someone else would force like I can you
know if if there were as a group of
people that you read or whatever like
that might happen
I will never willingly eat that I don't
care how they appear on tests that I
lose whatever I just don't care it
seriously
he called me a coward yeah I had I'm a
coward you know cal 2.0 my
brother-in-law he was over this weekend
I like he likes other because he'd watch
the stream but then this other the
Reaper turkeys just sitting there my
desk he's like so is it really that hot
well yeah his try it just I think try
like a little tiny piece he literally
like like this like a dime size a dime
size just like a little bit and he can
handle like spicy food no problem he
like eat seems like oh you have
milk and I get downstairs Brody's like
runs away seriously
like yeah actually drink milk but he was
like well you saw me on stream here's
babies have the exact same way with from
like that big actually watch part of it
back in s like I didn't realize how much
you were hurting yeah I was like I don't
like get through this stuff and then
decide this guy's when they DM me
afterwards they're like hey I hope
you're fully recovered from the reaper
like yeah yeah not really still in full
pain right now thanks guys
so that was that was good time to
process yeah times lessons learned all
right next up we've got a x01a I'm sure
there's a better way to pronounce that
for the five British pounds excellent
show guys keep up the great work we show
thank you appreciate you appreciating
our mediocrity Prix de El Jefe reviews
$10
I missed side a so here's ten bucks for
youth happy Halloween guys stay kill el
jefe thanks have a happy Halloween you
too DV Travel attend our how I done
goofed and didn't put my complete
address when ordering from
how's shop but I put a complete address
when I ordered from a shop can you guys
all walk a food at all do I have to eat
a booty hmm wait do I have to eat booty
what does that mean I don't know what he
means by eating booty
neither do I but TV John he's very smart
he gets multiple orders from both of our
sites very frequently and he often ships
them together so if the remainder of
your order information such as your name
and payments information is the same
he'll probably use whatever the complete
address is that you filled out right
there but if you're at all concerned
both of our websites on the stores have
a contact page where you can email
directly and John is really good about
getting back to emails yeah which is a
complete opposite of me and Kyle we're
terrible terrible oh yeah never email us
ever um still not sure what you mean by
the booty thing but good luck with it
either
Tyler Farnsworth for the five bucks bars
you try building a PC right after eating
a Carolina Reaper tried something
similar when I was in the Marine Corps
and it was miserable yeah you're really
selling you should try this thing that I
tried it was also yeah like hey sure
Tyler that sounds great you should put
yourself connect myself to pain nope
I've seen enough reaction videos of
people eating Carolina Reapers on
YouTube and is not something that I've
seen and been like yes I'm doing that
right away no no thank you I like my
regular spicy food just fine thank you
Aaron Barlow for the five bucks thanks
for the stream guys Cheers cheers to you
as well here's mr. Aaron
Bravo Bravo mmm-hmm thanks Aaron this
next one's from gamers Nexus oh good old
gamers noises flesh $50 Wow so generous
you are definitely getting your CPU but
definitely in all caps all keys capping
it in her clickbait it won't get lost in
the mail also for what it's worth we
have six thermocouples on the board and
are over a hundred see on those fence
holy crap definitely want direct cooling
or liquid for a big overclock more soon
PS I know where you live thank you for
just haunting my
Sol at the very end of that very
informative but also threatening mistake
and donation was actually providing
Steve with you actually
[Laughter]
thank you those theories always one step
ahead yeah thanks man Steve it oh oh by
the way Steve if you are still watching
I know Kyle sent you his CPU I was
wondering if I can borrow your de litter
from der power once you're done with it
although I have been intending to hit
him up directly and he probably sent me
what I have I have the the LGA 1151 just
go hit up Steve for like all of your CPU
D lighting needs yeah he'll more than
graciously service accommodate all of
you all right Giovani
nickim is 20 bucks 20 bucks I've had
money while in Community College but
next fall I'll be at university which
means I'll be poor can I survive two
years on my 970 SL I set up with a 1600
X on all future games over or equal to
60 FPS on high to ultra settings at
1080p or grab should I grab a GTX 1080
before I go I would I would lean towards
grabbing the 1080 simply because your
970 is effectively working with 3.6 gigs
of memory and that's probably what
you're gonna be running up into a wall
against like granted most GPUs within
the past couple years with the right
settings on a game you can get playable
framerates with but if you're actually
hitting a wall with the amount of GPU
memory that's available you'll see frame
rates drop off pretty quickly and if
you're talking about current games
triple-a titles and especially if you're
talking about anything much beyond 1080
then more video memory is probably gonna
be something that you want you know that
said you said 1080p 60 frames per second
and if you're not playing the newest
high-end triple-a titles then you can
probably get away with what you got
right now but he did say all future
games talking all future games
and all of you games you want to go
gravy Ram most of all yeah cuz even
certain games now are maxing out three
point five gigs no problem at 1080p yep
I like GTA 5 for example etc okay pilot
RC helis what the best helis yes they
don't the best affordable
cable exceptions you can get I hear fan
techs are great but are there any other
options that won't cost an arm and a leg
most cable extension kits that I've seen
cost between fifty and a hundred dollars
for a full someone fill kit depending on
whether you're just talking about 24 pin
plus 4 pin 24 plus 8 24 plus 8 plus 6 6
or 8 6 or 8 and 8 and another 8
depending on your graphics cards
requirements so that can increase the
price but there are options directly
from the power supply manufacturers EVGA
for example sells a kit but they're
still relatively expensive I would say
just keep an eye on some of the
custom-designed they're the custom
designers who do custom sleeve cables
out there because there's quite a few
smaller companies have cropped up
through really good jobs
Carol and I have both worked with
insourced for example mm-hmm en sourced
and sourced customs wise mods I've seen
as months I haven't seen in person his
work but I've seen quite a picture quite
a few pictures and he does a great job
as well yeah I mean frame customs
mainframe customs is another there's
their slightly bigger but you know you
can get some good work through them as
well anybody else I know those are the
ones that I feel like should jump to my
mind but who wait
ah is it someone you've used no and
sourced is quite awesome the bomb 1000
yes a completely agree yeah they do some
great work hold on
mod one PC metal Jeff if that's metal
mods Jeff hello hello hello
v1 tech v1 tech right yeah they do some
guys new insect we've we've known him
for actually quite a while yeah and they
do all the lying back plates a bunch of
other stuff but rails is the cable
sleeping options so v1 tech I'd also
suggest checking out cuz there's a again
quite a few options there and you know
power supply the manufacturers to make
power supplies they're doing alright you
can pay EVGA for it for a sleeved kit
but honestly I feel like some of these
more independent companies and get
something that's a little bit more
unique maybe a little bit more
customized to what you wants as far as
the color options and that kind of thing
and yes you they may cost a few more
dollars but they're really high quality
so yeah check them out indeed thank you
very much for your donation kay pilots I
Dennis rigid bridge Don or redone five
bucks
here's your five also you know something
you got five bucks thanks for hanging
out with us for Halloween yes I know yes
I do thank you very much
I know that you guys are awesome and we
do appreciate your patronage asdf asdf
put a lot of thought into that username
$5 I never seen anyone using the EVGA
power link I think it provides a cleaner
look any opinions Jade did a video on
the EVGA power link which you guys could
check out Jays to sense its unique old
product I feel like people who are
seriously concerned about aesthetics for
something like that tend to get sleeved
kits and if you have a nice sleeved kit
or even something with extensions then
you really don't want the power link
because it takes that nice stable
sleeping and hides it around the side so
it's really made more for you know
you know cheaper power supply or
something like that where you just want
to move that cabling off to the side
it's fairly effective but um I would
agree with you I haven't seen it used
too much yeah I have four of them at
home yeah I have I got him I got him
more than I would ever need which is I
was I was in a band where EVGA was
giving them away in the swag bag and I
got a ended up with two of them there
but yeah I mean it's it's not a bad
product at all if you're in the if
you're suddenly in that situation where
you need it it's very effective but you
know I just don't see people like
alright I'm gonna do this and this and
this then we get the EVGA power link put
there then everything's gonna look
awesome
yeah you either want to show off your
cables or you don't care yeah it doesn't
clean though when implemented properly
that's true Dell Beck six dollars this
is six cents medal Paul put Kyle's wig
on I built the Sandy Bridge I five with
an R X 480 during side a as htpc to spam
pimp my PC submissions PC because my
main rig gets no love well maybe your
main rig is already too pimped to pimped
because make it onto the segment Scott
you ever think about that if it's too
good it doesn't get picked right nothing
to be critiqued yes there needs to be
some pimping that can be add which means
you're just an awesome builder and super
metal as well obviously but thank you
very much for the donation Ashwin Mehra
ten dollars from my build the PCIe cable
is dual six plus two mistake one and I
used wrong lengths mistake too
so I can't return them hoping for sales
to buy new ones tips fer the cable combs
thinking of table lacing Ashwin and I'm
pretty sure this is the guy who had the
PIP my PC that yeah looks very clean
except for that game users I would
seriously take a look at cable lacing I
was trying to do that with arctic
panther and I had to like give up
because I was just impatient with it but
what's cable lacing again
basically the process of using string
fishing wire some very thin material to
lace the cables so it holds them in
place just the cable some training wood
so it's just training I say but if you
do it right and you do it with like thin
fishing wire some something like that
you can set it up and just leave it
there and hold it in place but you need
to lace it properly so definitely checks
just if you look up PSU cable lacing
there's several videos that I found on
it that kind of show you pushing it
through and doing it but I'd say for
your situation that would be a very
viable option for getting those cables
just for all the cables to line up right
that's all you really need yeah and
those cable combs that you have they're
just they're holding everything really
far apart right and it's not looking
that clean so that I think would be a
good potential solution for you and you
wouldn't even need to really spend that
much money it's just a matter of kind of
watching the videos and playing around
with the lacing or you can do what I did
with hot line and just buy some
nice-looking velcro straps and you can
sort of train them enough to be okay for
like the first few inches before they
get unruly and just like velcro strap
maybe once or twice along the extension
that's visible from that left side of
your of your case I found that that
works just as well it's super cheap and
easy it's super easy
it's a velcro strap so it worked out for
for hotline so maybe it'll work out for
you give it a shot
they've also got velcro straps of
different colors and stuff to match your
theme but next up we've got michael
Morton right no wait is that right no no
we're gonna Jacob Jacob Twitchell fine
buckle hey guys I just wanted to say I
love watching your show also Paul
congratulations on your pumpkin brings
you to meeting an awesome hardware it
sure does and you've even put little
spiders on it scary they're spiders very
festive very festive now this is the
first-ever jack-o'-lantern to get
demonetized michael morton six dollars
and sixty six cents love the shirts I
got from you and Paul CPU cooler and
those flasher and all these zero
insertion force it yes those are all
classics
they will live forever thank you very
much sir ducky Dobie mean five bucks go
check out my costume tweet PS I love you
guys we love you Thank You Jackie
thanks ducky Tyler finds worth 5 bucks
feel free to call me professor
Futurama since you're too scared to eat
the reaper put the pumpkin on your head
Cal this is a little bit too small for
me to put a pumpkin on my head I already
did that once in stack attack and it was
not the most pleasant yeah also very
hilarious so if you guys want to check
that out you can do that now on the
channel and then that's pretty much it
for the donations we do have a couple
Johnston's to shout three John's Mary
and Mary Ann from Calamba Laguna yeah
Philippines thank you very much for
picking up an evolution shirt over in
the PAS
thank you Mary Ann Rob or Robert from
Illinois little bit I got the beer sets
thank you so much Rob Johnson for users
who Bryant Bryant Salinas CPU cooler and
where's no circle pint glass thank you
very much sir Johnson baby Chow a mouth
