swatted and you know people accidentally
thinking that they're not streaming
anymore when they are they do something
super embarrassing nothing good ever
happens I don't know why we're streaming
tonight but that is the case it seems so
welcome to the stream everyone hello I
am joined tonight by I know she I'm
joined I joined she is my guest she's my
guest that's everyone this is my show
that she's a special guest anyway while
she while she continues thinking she's
right she's been wrong before by the way
welcome to tonight welcome to the stream
I don't even know what to call this it's
just a casual stream as the thumbnail
suggests we are gonna be playing some
battlegrounds for the first time ever
very popular game but we are just old
people apparently and just super
irrelevant so this is our first time
playing or while you're more so you than
I am I have barely had time to go this
is like the first time I've actually sat
down and played a game in a really long
time but no one wants to hear me talk
about that let's let's I guess just dive
right in here
how's everyone going how's everyone
how's everyone doing tonight you guys
doing all right
are you guys going well is your night
going alright fun funny story we
actually had no intentions of streaming
tonight at all
we actually I actually had to spend
about an hour just to get my room set up
to do this stream but the only reason
we're doing it is because the video I
was currently working on which was an
actual real semi informative video got
sort of derailed for reasons I cannot go
into right now but at least we'll get
hopefully an entertaining stream out of
it so hello everyone in chat hello
hello hello I'm glad I'm glad you never
left pornhub terrible place to leave
alright everyone's doing good yeah how
can ye sauce gets the hearts next to her
name I don't ever get it I don't even
get a heart I get like like sometimes
like a little like a weiner you know
I'll get like an eight because your
equal sign equal sign equal sign capital
D I get a lot of those next to my name
which I guess could be like a heart
maybe maybe that's why Kyle you're sexy
yeah good luck Kyle someone wish me luck
wishing someone luck is way better than
it was stupid heart okay looks just
happening so fast I can't even read
what's going on I know whoa hey so guys
um you'll forgive us in advance
apologies in advance if we aren't super
attentive with chat because it is as you
can see scrolling at an unfathomable
rate and it's it's kind of difficult for
us to sort of vet all of your
suggestions and stuff or all your
comments but rest assured they are
always appreciated I like a full check I
like a live chat blossoming I don't like
it when it's just like every five
minutes ten more minutes that's a very
sad chat if chat could make a noise
that's the sound my chat my ideal chat
would make anyway anyway we are totally
totes streaming yo so let's let's give
the people what will be promised and try
and play this stupid game you're already
in so um you guys are only gonna be able
to see my screen you won't be able to
actually view wifey's gameplay but
that's ok because we're gonna be
sticking together most of the time
anyway so I guess you sort of get the
idea let's go ahead and try connecting
to a North America server
I believe we're already grouped up we're
gonna be doing duo's so this is sort of
similar to h1z1 a game that we're both
very familiar with however we've again
never played this game so hopefully we
can apply some of what we know in h1
to battlegrounds and we're not
completely in the dark but let's go
ahead and start a match click the cancel
click it click - ready oh yes look both
both screens synced up at the same time
love it when that happens
love it when things work our audio is
very low a hold on check one two whoa is
that too loud now maybe that's a little
bit loud check one two check
I am NOT going to take off my shirt oh
look it's even got like a fun little
lobby area just like h1 hey thank you

don't even know where we are
oh shit we need to go over north
yeah northeast who's in the house we're
like all right if you hold shift you'll
run okay got that
everything just Auto run shit
well we really suck at this game knowing
wait so why is everything all distorted
does it mean like I think cuz we need to
stay within the circle but we are not
okay but I mean like it just looks weird
it looks like we're hallucinating is
that what this game is about like don't
really know just someone injects you
with hallucinogenics
yeah very far away from them where we
want to be okay I think we're pretty
much dead now no we're good we're good
we got this no I did
oh crap we dead son crap bro bro you're
dead risky yeah we're really dead I
can't reload while I'm running
I cannot reload right now give me a
second oh my goodness so yeah oh yeah
there's no way yeah we're totally dead

keep your eyes out for Rick Clark
the circle is like the gas in each one
okay got it yeah that's what I figured I
just so wrapped up and trying to find a
backpack that I completely forgot about
but it's being in the right place it's
the red circle that's like the gas in
each one right no the red circles the
bombs completely different things like
which circles we want to be in the white
circle with the blue circle there's two
circles under that I think blue circles
safe and then white circle is like where
it's going to enclose - do you know what
I mean like that's the next safe zone
like they do the same thing in each one
I'm dying
yeah we're gonna die but you know what
do you see a car over there at least we
actually we didn't do anything we need
to pay better attention to the map like
each one
yeah oh so I see so it's like a
protective shield that we need to be in
yeah that's what so basically we do need
to be in the white circle Oh someone's
asked to tell me to take the energy
drink what energy drink how do I use
this use use I have one how do I use the
energy drink well it's nice knowing you
