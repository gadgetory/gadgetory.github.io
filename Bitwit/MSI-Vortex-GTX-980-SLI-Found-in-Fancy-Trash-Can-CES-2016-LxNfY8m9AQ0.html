2016 is brought to you by need for seat
go to need for seat USA comp for the
ultimate gaming chair experience for
your desk in office and Corsair they
make good products and you should buy
them what's up guys we are here back at
CES 2016 at the msi booth we're taking a
look at the msi vortex now this caught
my eye immediately when i walked in this
is essentially a built pc it is
preassembled but there are a few tricks
up its sleeve that make it stand out
from any other pre-built system that you
might see first of all it's rocking some
incredible hardware there's actually two
models that are become available
sometime in q1 or q2 including two gtx
960 s in sli or you can get the model of
two gtx 980 s in sli those are desktop
GPUs this is not mobile these are
full-fledged unthought old untampered
with full fledged desktop video cards
and you get a gtx i'm sorry and you get
a core i7 6700 k skylake cpu which is
overclockable I'm pretty sure that's for
the flagship version I don't know if
it's gonna be a core i5 for the for the
gtx 960 sli model but you are gonna have
some heavy-duty overclocking capacity
here all powered by a 450 watt gold
rated 80 plus power supply which is
which is quite impressive actually now
there's a couple things that make this a
vortex including the cooling system so
there's actually a kind of a revolving
blade up at the top here a spinning
vortex fan if you will that actually
intakes air from the bottom exhausted
out the top now essentially what you
have is the heatsink going through the
entire middle part of the case from the
top to the bottom which kind of serves
as a spine that all the other components
are connected to so you've got a card
here another card here and your CPU as
far as storage and memory capacities you
actually get either I think it's 16 or
32 gigs depending on the the tier of
model as well as 2m 2 slots for nvme
SSDs and of course I think one of those
maybe even two of those are already
populated with with storage ready to go
for either of those models but all
together a really cool system if we take
a look at the back we've got a couple
ports here we've got three USB 3 ports
always nice to have as well as two HDMI
these are 1.4 so no 2.0 quite yet we
also have two killer
Ethernet ports you can kind of share
bandwidth with those very high speed
very reliable and we've also got two
mini displayport and two Thunderbolt
three ports for just a plethora of
connectivity options here and just I
just want to take a moment to appreciate
the aesthetic of this and all the design
that's probably gone into this this
brilliant piece of art that really is
kind of cool
also you see some lighting strips as far
as the aesthetic goes these are RGB
interchangeable you can change it to
pretty much any color you want the only
thing you can't change is the red MSI
logo that is their staple trademark so
you can't really touch that but all
together are really cool and promising
little unit from MSI and I'm covering
the exhaust right here I don't want this
thing to blow up but you can also see
there's like 4k stuff going on in the
background this thing is 4k and V are
ready especially with two GTX 980 s in
there so more good things to see from
MSI let's go ahead and go over there too
because we're not done at this booth yet
so stay tuned alright guys were over
here at the msi motherboards the
motherboard section msi has been really
stepping up their motherboard game
lately I must say they're still kicking
kicking the out of out of noobs
with their crate gaming Edition
motherboard this is the 3 X it's a new
z170a board from their line it looks
like a really nice premium board but
it's actually not too expensive so
really great if you're gonna hop on that
black and white color scheme for your
system don't want to focus too much on
that though because there's actually
more exciting stuff over here such as
the gaming Pro carbon now this is also a
z170 board z170a as MSI is deeming it
but it's got some really nice blacked
out features here everything everything
is pretty much blacked out from the from
the DIMM slots to the the PCI Express
although you do get some nice metallic
armor on both the PCIe by 16 slots and
and just a really nice carbon fiber
finish actually everywhere as the name
might suggest you get carbon finish on
the heat sinks for the vrm as well as
the chipset and it's just kind of a nice
minim minimalistic design I really like
how they've gone with a blackout version
here just to have it match with a lot
more things on the rear here you've got
a bunch of different ports including USB
3.1 type a and type C so you get both of
those connectors as we start to see a
lot more Type C devices grow in
popularity so that's really nice to see
and lastly we've got the x99 a god-like
gaming carbon so if you guys remember
last CES MSI came out with another
like motherboard that looked much
different than this one it was black and
red and it had RGB lighting which kind
of killed it for everyone because no
matter what color you changed the LEDs
to you were still stuck with the red
that's that was plastered all over the
heat sinks and motherboard etc so what
they've done here is they've really
listened to user feedback and they've
gone with again a really nice black out
color theme here pretty much everything
is black except for some silver accents
on the the heatsink chipset the godlike
branding over the over the rear i/o and
you've got again metallic armor over the
PCIe slots all the PCIe slots as well as
the the ddr4 dimm slots as well all
together a really nice set up here from
MSI in terms of motherboards some of the
nicest looking motherboards I've seen
here at CES so far so stay tuned for
more coverage note we're not done we're
gonna go over there there's more
