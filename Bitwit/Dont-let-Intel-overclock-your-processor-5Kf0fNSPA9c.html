overclocking the core I $9.99 hundred K
that's inside of ol hotline to here but
wait Kyle haven't you already done that
before yes you're absolutely right but
this time around we're gonna be
overclocking the chip using Intel's
performance Maximizer utility it's an
overclocking tool one-click overclocking
it's completely automated from Intel
it's the first of its kind from Team
Blue now I'm curious to see if Intel's
performance Maximizer IPM can beat my
manual overclock Cinebench score it's
gonna be it's gonna be a bit of a
showdown and to make things even more
interesting we have a pretty nice golden
sample here this 9900 K I mean is is
Silicon lottery material for the most
part I was able to get 5 gigahertz on
all eight cores at just one point two
three volts definitely on the low end in
terms of voltages four five gigahertz
flash so I'm excited about that we'll
see what IPM can do it's also worth
pointing out that with the launch of
this new application Intel's also
revamped their what is it called the
performance tuning protection program
now you have the option to pay a $20.00
premium which protects your CPU in the
event that it dies from overclocking you
can set it into Intel they'll send you a
brand new one as long as the processor
is still under the standard product
warranty additionally this is only good
for one failure your CPU can only die
once it's kind of a one-time deal and
finally the program itself is right now
only supporting six different Intel SKUs
so you've got the 9600 K 9700 K 9900 K
and all of their KF versions so six
chips in total will probably be rolling
out support for additional CPUs in the
future but I don't know if that's
confirmed yet for now let's go ahead and
fire up the the IPM and we'll get
overclocking alright so I'm just gonna
fire it up I've already installed it on
my desktop I have never launched this
program before guys I'm saving my I'm
saving my first time for you you should
feel special alright so here it is until
performance Maximizer okay okay I agree
that I could potentially fry my chip
apparently this program creates a 16
gigabyte partition on your drive so that
it can store whatever data it needs to
set your auto overclock so we do have
enough storage yes I'm going to shrink
the partition okay I'm not exactly sure
how long this is all going to take so I
might have to do some editing magic and
I guess while we're waiting here it's
worth pointing out that it says it's an
overclocking or it's an automated
overclocking utility but there's quite a
few requirements that need to be set in
the BIOS in order for this application
to work
properly for example you need turbo
boost enabled speed stuff I think has to
be on UEFI mode has to be on for the
BIOS and there's like three or four
other things so I feel like a lot of
people might already have all those
settings good to go by default and they
won't have to fiddle with anything if
not you still kind of have to jump into
the BIOS and tweak those settings and I
feel like an automated overclocking
utility like this isn't really meant for
the diehard enthusiast it's meant for
people who might not be as familiar or
comfortable with entering a UEFI and you
know messing around with that so just
something to be aware of if this is your
let's say your first build and you're
thinking oh it's really just a
no-brainer one-click thing there might
be some additional assembly required
okay I think the partitions been created
it looks like we're ready to go here it
says ready and there's gonna be some
test run on the system it's gonna need
to reboot several times and it could
take several hours holy crap okay so
this is maybe something that'll have to
come back to in the morning because it's
fairly late right now these tests may
fail your system may not reach the
maximum overclock frequency if the BIOS
settings haven't been changed to their
default values which they have Auto
overclocking settings are enabled in
BIOS which they're not another
overclocking application is altered your
systems frequency all good there please
let continue to run tests now oops wait
that's that's a little counterintuitive
Intel because there's also pop up here
that says you sure you want to reboot
your system to run these tests yeah yeah
I do okay my computer hot line 2 is in
your hands now Intel don't don't this up
aha look it's doing things at this point
I have no idea how long this process is
gonna take it could take several hours
it could take less than an hour but it's
getting pretty late so I'm gonna go to
bed and tomorrow morning I'll hopefully
wake up to a nice stable overclock and
we'll take it from there
mmm expert ego good morning morning
everyone I came back to this it looks
like our test results are ready to view
yeah I'm glad everything went well looks
like everything was set right in the
BIOS I'm just gonna click continue okay
and hopefully it'll spit out oh wait
what okay alright so 4.9 gigahertz it
looks like it was increased about 200
megahertz from from 4.7 so right out of
the gate my manual overclock was 100
megahertz higher at 5 meter it's flat
but let's just see how this overclock
performs I'm gonna
a Cinebench this way we can also get a
score to compare against bimanual OC I'm
also gonna open up hardware info 64 so
I'm gonna be looking at voltage clock
speed and temperatures while this is
going on you can see right here just as
we're idling we're hitting around four
point a little over four point seven
gigahertz so not quite a four point nine
although it is spiking up to four point
eight as you can see there let's see
what happens when we click row okay our
clock speeds at four point seven still
we're not hitting four point nine at all
temperatures are in the 70s it's a
little higher actually than my manual OC
the vid is around one point two seven
one point two eight but yeah we're not
we're not actually hitting the suggested
frequency and we're done so okay that's
that's some interesting behavior there
that I think is a little a little
disappointing but let's see how the
performance looks alright so starting
with Cinebench are twenty in the
multi-threaded test you can see that I
not only tested my manual overclock if I
bigger Hertz and Intel performance
Maximizer but also the system just
running bone-stock that's the the bottom
graph there the bottom bar there as well
as with multi-core enhancement enabled
if you're not familiar with MCE it's
basically like a pre overclock or like a
factory overclock set by the motherboard
manufacturer they don't actually dial in
a specific clock speed but rather they
allow the CPU to operate outside of
Intel's specifications so you will
potentially see variants between
different motherboard manufacturers
based on how they actually configure
their own MCE sometimes it's not even
called M C it's under a different name
depending on the motherboard vendor that
you're using but it's basically a
factory overclock a lot of board vendors
are just enabling it by default like
right out of the box so I felt it was an
important piece of data to include in
today's tests with that said you can see
our results here with the stock score
getting four thousand three hundred and
ninety points that's our baseline our
manual overclock was able to actually
pump out five thousand one hundred and
twenty three points that's a 17 percent
uplift over stock not too shabby Intel
performance Maximizer did well here too
giving four thousand nine hundred and
eighteen points that's a twelve percent
performance bump over stock and MCE
actually beat out ipm it got fairly
close to my my personal overclock
actually getting five thousand and
seventy
points that's a 14% uplift overstock so
again your mileage may vary with MCE
depending on the motherboard that you're
using and the Maximus love an extreme
that we're using today being a very top
tier high-end motherboard I would assume
that it's MCE parameters are a bit more
aggressive than you might find on an
entry-level or budget board moving on to
Premiere Pro this is a rendering test we
had a 10-minute clip at 1080p 60fps
h.264 this is basically showing the time
that it took to render that clip with
the given settings so the times measured
in seconds lower is better here of
course at the very bottom you can see
our stock system was able to render it
out in 472 seconds with my manual
overclocked we actually rendered it out
eight percent faster with four hundred
and thirty five seconds on the clock IPM
did not do very well here in fact it
actually performed worse than stock
taking three point four percent longer
to render at the clip not exactly sure
what happened here or why that is but I
ran the test multiple times and this was
the result MCE coming in hot getting a
score of four hundred and thirty five
seconds that ties my manual overclocked
by bigger Hertz scores so clearly we can
see that asus has dialed in a fairly
aggressive tuning for their multi-core
enhancement on this specific board now
moving on to gaming I only tested two
titles here because this isn't a super
deep dive video it's more or less a
first look at IP M but here we have GTA
5 at 1080p max settings across the board
with two X NS a a and you can see here
that both our manual overclock and
multi-core enhancement were able to
score a modest uplift over stock going
from 98 frames per second on average to
about 100 and 203 that's that's about a
4 or 5% bump in performance ipm once
again was it fell short of stock
performance for some reason I tested
this again multiple times it was
repeatable and we actually went down a
couple frames that was both on average
frame rates and 1% lows so that's
actually why I decided to test a second
game it was just gonna be one game
initially but then I tested Metro last
light to see if if that was repeatable
and sure enough IBM fared worse it fared
worse than stock with noble tech core
enhancement enabled we went from a
hundred and sixty-two frames to 159
frames per second we saw a really nice
performance improvement with our manual
overclock and with MCE enabled both of
which rendered about
8% more frames on average than our
bone-stock system so IPM doesn't seem to
be doing us any favors in gaming in fact
it's actually hurting our performance
compared to a bone-stock system um it
did do nicely in Cinebench r20 again
that 12% bump is really nice but at the
same time IPM performed worse than our
stock system in Premiere Pro so it makes
it really difficult for me to know how
and where and when to recommend this
program because the data is just so all
over the place it's very inconsistent
not exactly sure if that's just
something that Intel needs to refine
over time but as of now this doesn't
look like the best way to go if you're
trying to overclock your cpu at least in
my experience
so something this quick little video up
I would say that manually overclocking
your CPU is the most consistent and best
performing way to overclock your cpu IPM
for now is not a program that I could
recommend just because the data is
showing me that it's actually hurting
performance in a lot of cases and until
I either do more research or there's
more information out on it I can't
necessarily suggest that anyone use this
as their primary form of overclocking
MCE
is sort of a wild card because it varies
from motherboard to motherboard in our
case it actually performed more or less
on par with my manual overclock and a
lot of tests which is very impressive of
course I have a very high tier
motherboard that has a more aggressive
tuning probably MCE has also been the
topic of some controversy here and there
because of just the way it operates the
way that motherboard manufacturers kind
of sneakily throw it into their BIOS and
enable it by default right out of the
box so users are reporting things like
you know this vrm throttling or their
cooling solution not being able to
handle the pre overclock because they're
just not aware that it's going on they
don't know what it is so I feel like
there's a lack of transparency with MCE
even though it can be used effectively
and properly and actually give you some
really nice results so do some research
on it
find out how it operates with your
specific motherboard if you do plan to
use it and and good luck maybe I'll
report more or do a video on it
specifically in the near future but guys
that's pretty much gonna do it for me if
you guys have any experience with IPM so
far granted if you meet the very
specific hardware criteria to actually
use it feel free to share your
experience down below I hope you guys
fared better than I did today
possibly on the video if you enjoyed it
and get subscribed for more tech stuff
coming at you really soon thanks for
watching
I will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
