new AG TV huh close one but yeah as you
can see I've started my own channel and
it's just an opportunity for me to do
some more creative stuff and be more
free in the content that I create I kind
of am leaning more towards the yoked
kind of material so I still want to do
entertainment news I'm gonna be doing a
lot of that but I kinda want to also
branch out just from everyday day tech
stuff aside from that I don't really
have any content to show you guys right
now cuz I'm not set up at all as you can
see I'm using like a little flip camera
here the lighting in here is terrible
you know I don't even have a tripod at
this point actually I do but I was too
lazy to use it first video give me a
break
so I thought I would just show you my
personal rig that I use at home because
you guys are all very tech savvy since
you know me from Newegg if you're
watching this and so yeah hope you guys
enjoy this and I'll see you in a sec all
right dudes so this is my rig as you can
see I've got a snow edition Corsair 600
T mid tower case freakin love this case
super awesome has tons of airflow and
just complete dream to build then I
built my first system in here and went
completely smooth especially since I had
Paul tutorial videos helping me every
bit of the way here's a look inside I've
got a 2600 K core i7 overclocked
currently and I think it's 40 400
megahertz and it's being cooled as you
can see by an H 100 keeping the temps to
a minimum 8 gigs of Corsair Vengeance
ddr3 I've got a I think that's an Arctic
PWM Arctic cooling PWM fan in the back
that I replaced the stock Corsair fan
with just 120-millimeter oh and by the
way I've got to remove this it really
sucks not having a cameraman shouldn't
take it for granted I got these fans a
while back I know they're not matching
but I got a really good deal on them so
I didn't really care they're cougar
cougar vortex pwm fans 120 millimeters
millimeter and they have really good
high static pressure so they're really
good for radiators
see aside from that I've got a blu-ray
player in the front no one cares um I've
got the BitFenix alchemy white cables
making it look super sexy ACS directs
you to GTX 670 awesome card keeps temps
also very cool even under load HX 750
watts from corsair more than enough for
the GK 104 it's just super good with
thermals very power efficient as well
and as far as drives go I don't even
talk about the motherboard it's a PA z68
vPro motherboard from Asus lovely lovely
motherboard matches perfectly with my
Corsair Vengeance Ram as you can tell
I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to
aesthetics I like my computer to look
really nice and I'm kind of a girl when
it comes to my computer kind of a girl
needs to look beautiful all the time so
my drives here as I said at the blu-ray
drive up top from Asus combo Drive and
then I've got a 1 terabyte Seagate
Barracuda and then three SSDs the two on
the bottom those are vertex fours I
recently got those put them in a raid 0
their 256 gigs total so 128 gig
capacities each and it's basically my
boot drive and the drive I added off of
and then that drive just above that is a
it's a corsair m4 I'm sorry crucial m4
it's only a 64 gig because I all I use
it for is media cache for Adobe Premiere
which is the software that I edit on
works very nice as a media cache very
fortunate that this thing day and age I
can afford to use an SSD for immediate
cash I'm will give you a look at my
cable management it's pretty god-awful
leave believe it or not it used to be
worse but there it is and as you can see
there's a second crucial on for another
64 gig and I don't know what I use that
for that's just there in case I needed
seriously I haven't I haven't found a
use for it yet
I feel bad leaving in a box letting it
rust away and collect dust so it's just
there in case I need it but yeah and I
think that's about it they cover
everything
probably not but
that's that's the gist of it I suppose
that's all for now there'll be more
coming soon I don't know what that was
that was really weird just ignore that
but you know there will be more coming
soon and that is all for now so don't
ignore that I promise the next video
will have better video quality it won't
have my arm as a tripod and I might get
some more adequate lighting in here but
that is all for now so thank you all for
watching and I guess I'll see you guys
later
no I'll see you guys soon yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
