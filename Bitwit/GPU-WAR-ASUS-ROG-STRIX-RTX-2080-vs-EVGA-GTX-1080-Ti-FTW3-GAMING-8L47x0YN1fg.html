I left my define s and our six in the
same room together last night and now
there's a third case like what's going
on
oh right never had a baby let me guess
it's got a PSU shroud flexible yeah
actually wait hold on how do two
computer cases you know make a baby I
don't have time to explain this to you
you need to know how humans do it first
I gotta go okay okay I gotta ask you
guys do you like touch dust filters or
something is Lou be the non-conductive
is there thermal paste involved and if
so you know where does it go now stay in
silent okay good talk just wrap it up
next time I'm running out of space the
define s2 from fractal design features
front panel USB C ample water cooling
support and a clean interior layout for
your next custom build click the link
below to learn more
all right is so we're doing a GPU
showdown today it's gonna be sort of a
battle on multiple fronts because not
only are we comparing at inboard
partners we're also sort of battling out
different GPU architectures with Pascal
and Turing going head-to-head so it
should be pretty exciting guys on the
left or my left here right I have the
EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 TI for the win
three and in the other corner we have
the asus rog Strix RT x 2080 gaming OC
it's a classic battle of old versus new
but don't underestimate the gtx 1080p i
just yet it's still a very relevant card
here in 2018 with superior pricing and
availability to the RT x-series so hold
on to your butt's people because these
cards are coming in hot not into your
but just in general some expression why
do you look disappointed
now a moment ago I briefly mentioned
pricing and availability so let's talk
about that really quick on Amazon right
now you can find this EVGA card for a
whopping 810 --is-- dollars u.s. which
is pretty steep IMO however it is in
stock and you can purchase it right now
on the other hand the Strix r-tx 2080 is
going for eight hundred and sixty nine
dollars on new egg right now which is
not a whole lot more than our for the
win three card when you're paying nearly
a grand for a graphics card because our
TX is a fresh GPU launch it's near
impossible to find these cards right now
at semi reasonable rates and it could be
weeks if not months until we see them
reach normal supply levels also you
should definitely consider other GTX
1080p eyes that aren't this one because
there are cheaper options out there that
can be had for a lot less than either of
the cards we're talking about today
so moving on to the overall design of
these cards aesthetics I'm not going to
go over really because that's highly
subjective but size is definitely
objective so both of these cards
actually have the exact same length at
eleven point eight inches however the
EVGA card is about half an inch taller
so if you're anticipating GPU height
clearance to be an issue in your case
that's something to be aware of I do
like the fact that this card keeps a
very strict two slot design because
that's certainly not the case on our
Strix card with a two point seven slot
cooler this thing is incredibly thick
and I can see two main concerns here the
first of which is mounting it vertically
inside of your case the the GPU shroud
might be rubbing up against your
tempered glass side panel too closely
and cutting off any circulation or air
flow to the fans and that would not be
good similarly in a Mini ITX case with a
power supply basement that PSU shroud
could be rubbing up too closely to the
bottom of your card and that could also
result in some heating issues so things
to be aware of in those specific
scenarios now if you're into RGB
lighting you might be disappointed but
the Strix isn't the most conducive to
vertical mounting because most of its
lighting elements are on that side of
the shroud there's a little bit of
backlit ROG branding on the front but
it's definitely not as much and we have
100% of our lighting on the front side
of our EGA card you can see it's just
very blatant in-your-face no lighting
whatsoever on the bottom of the card so
if you vertically mounted this guy you
wouldn't be able to see much lighting
unless
you are looking from above both cards
have dual eight pin power connectors and
bio switches to target performance or
acoustics but the Strix card also has a
stealth button that will allow you to
kill all the RGB lighting in one fell
swoop it also has an addressable a 12
volt four pin addressable RGB LED header
and two four pin pwm fan headers on it
that will ramp up or down depending on
the temperatures of your GPU as far as
GPU sag is concerned the gtx 1080i is
has virtually no set it's pretty
straight across the board it feels very
secure when mounted in there the Strix
has the slightest amount of GPU sag it's
so minimal that most people won't notice
unless they're actively looking for it I
think my main concern here is how much
worse that might get over time due to
that thicker heavier heatsink now the
rear i/o and graphics cards is typically
not very interesting but I think it's
worth pointing out that the r-tx cards
are featuring that new virtual link USB
type-c connector so that if you want to
seamlessly connect a next-generation VR
headset you can do so over a single USB
type-c cable both of these cards have
received the triple fan treatment but
the GPU on the Strix card is actually
staying about two degrees cooler on
average thanks to several things
including these new axial tech fans that
increase the amount of static pressure
that's firing downward onto the fin
array the larger fin stack in general is
just providing more surface area and
you've got things like the max contact
technology from Asus that they've
carried over from the previous
generation all those elements make this
the quieter card as well that's not to
say that our 1080 Ti is super loud or
anything it's actually I got really good
acoustics but the Asus card is just it's
just bragging rights at this point it's
just so impressive how damn silent it is
under load so here's a quick sound test
so you can hear for yourself
now both of these cards ship factory
overclocked but that doesn't mean we
can't push them further so you can see
here that we actually had a bit more
headroom on our core clock for our Strix
card and so I was actually able to push
the the core clock offset for that a lot
further
whereas our EVGA card clearly had more
Headroom when it came to memory these
are the final settings that I used for
all today's testing along with the
latest driver from Nvidia that's wickel
driver for sixteen dot sixteen jumping
into our benchmarks you can see in fire
strike ultra the GTX 1080 Ti has a
pretty substantial lead but as we've
seen in the past this doesn't always
reflect real-world performance as we're
about to see in a bit as far as game
testing goes I did omit 1080p benchmarks
one because I wanted to reduce the
amount of CPU bottlenecking so that we
can just see these cards shine without
being bogged down by any CPU performance
and two because of relevancy I think if
you're buying a card that's $700 or more
you're probably gonna be gaming at
resolutions higher than 1080p so with
that said here's a look at our 1440p
results you can see I've bunched all the
games together today now apart from
Pascal edging out Turing in ashes of the
singularity the results here are
basically identical remember there's a
margin of error here from 1 to 2% and
even our 1% lows are basically the same
across the board so it seems at least at
1440p if performance is the only thing
you care about you really can't go wrong
with either of these cards it's a pretty
split drop i thought maybe things would
change a little at 2160p but no same
story here and it looks like EVGA has
added doomed to its short list of
victories but apart from that this is
the closest performance stalemate
between two GPUs that I've seen in quite
some time what the scores do show us is
that these cards can easily hit 100 FPS
at 1440p and 60 FPS at 4k in most
triple-a titles at max settings now
wrapping things up here if you're
absolutely set on purchasing one of
these pricier high-end options the Strix
r-tx 2080 is is the go-to card if you
care about early adopter technologies
like ray tracing DL SS and next-gen VR
there's always that risk with early
adopting because you don't know how the
technology is going to perform let alone
if you're going to enjoy it in the first
place so that's something that you'll
have to decide for yourself the Strix
definitely runs cooler and quieter than
its competitor but it's also the bulkier
of the two so it's less ideal for
vertical mounting and mini ITX cases now
you want a GPU stat if you need one
right now then go at the for the win
three because this card isn't actually
available right now you can purchase it
today if you wanted to like I just said
it's not as cool or quiet as the Strix
but noise and temps are still great
overall just beware if GPU high
clearance is an issue in your case this
is a tall card now if you want my
personal take and you just want me to
decide for you I would go with the RT X
2080 just because it's the newer
architecture it still has a long way to
go there's still a lot of optimizations
that can be had in the driver and game
development department whereas I don't
know the 10th series has kind of run
most of its course at this point we're
probably not going to see much more
improvement with future driver releases
as we will with RT X hypothetical
scenarios aside though I would highly
suggest that you guys check out some of
the other gtx 980ti offerings that can
be had for quite a bit less money than
either of these cards despite their
power and beauty that's gonna do it for
me guys let me know what your thoughts
are in the comments below feel free to
toss a like on this video if you enjoyed
