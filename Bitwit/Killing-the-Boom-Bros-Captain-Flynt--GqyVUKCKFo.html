I've gotten all the way up to captain
Flint oh by the way I beat the game a
couple days ago with my assassin which
I'm playing right now and yeah I beat it
at about level 30 and then I got all the
way up so right now I'm in true vault
hunter mode oh boy
okay this isn't good right now I'm
playing true vault hunter mode so I kind
of started the game over but so enemies
are more difficult and better loot will
be dropped that's always cool looks like
I'm about to fight a boss or I am
fighting a boss see I already did this
like yesterday but I exited out before I
got to captain Flint I actually reached
captain Flint which is like this this
area's boss and I figured Oh Borderlands
2 is cool they'll save me a checkpoint
so I can just exit out save and quit
it'll be cool
but no they're making me restart all the
way back to the beginning of this area
which is totally lame
you can't really expect someone to play
video games for that long
continuously gunite i guess they can but
so right now i'm fighting this dude boom
and his brother boom I already killed
boom actually this guy's really annoying
and then I got to worry about these
dudes oh yes its pistols awesome I love
it
where's this guy all right the one
complaint I have about that pistol is
that it zooms in a little too well so
when enemies are close I kinda have to
rely on my basic crosshair here isn't
the most accurate but combine that with
the assassin melee abilities and I've
got a pretty killer combo especially
because that gun if you notice has like
a little bayonet blade on the end of it
so it actually increases my melee by
like 50% or something like that very
useful if you're an assassin this is
actually a purple purple drop that I got
from killing the main boss the final
boss of the game which wasn't really
great by the way I was kind of
disappointed at how how lame it felt it
just didn't seem like a final boss fight
I don't know you guys tell me your
thoughts you played it you beat him and
Jack was pretty easy to kill as well
Jack was just like super he was all talk
man he's handsome that's his only card
and occasionally very crude save ammo
when possible
always remember that kids oh wow
apparently I haven't been doing a good
job of that okay it looks like I killed
the main boss so I just got to rid the
map of these fools now oh there is I
totally forgot that I actually have to
kill him on foot it's not cool
I feel like I want to keep these guys
around because in case I get a last
stand or whatever up Call of Duty
reference I want to be able to kill them
in a heartbeat
in case I get down oh just like right
about now all right all right get away
this is scary
last time I killed this guy had my buddy
Jeff with me so it wasn't that difficult
this guy was dead by now okay all right
I don't like you guys and this is
exactly why I kept you around
so I could kill you like that oh yes yes
no no no no no no okay I could probably
finish him right here and you're dead
thank God whoo wasn't too bad
considering I have all these awesome
weapons now that I beat the game I have
a feeling captain Flint will not be as
forgiving now let's be gonna fish in a
barrel
I actually went with a couple of friends
over the weekend to Hollywood Sports
Park it's basically an arena for
paintball and airsoft and all outdoors
but they basically had a kill house they
had these things called kill houses we
actually give you an airsoft gun and you
get to shoot you you go through a maze
that's all like decorated all spooky and
stuff and you actually should get to
shoot up people that are dressed up as
zombies that's their job is to is to get
shot by your airsoft gun so it's kind of
like a zombie apocalypse simulator if
you will and I thought it was gonna be
super badass I mean you guys are
probably like oh my god that's so
awesome and yeah that's what me and my
friends all thought too until we
actually went and it turned out to be
like super lame it just was a very
immersive like it just felt more like a
shooting gallery than like an you know
an exploration adventure there was no
sense of urgency although all the
zombies kind of were cluttered in one
place didn't feel like they were
attacking you from all sides it was just
a big disappointment but the concept I
feel is like extremely cool I wish it
had been better and I'm sure that there
are better ones I'm sure it's not like
an original idea but if you guys have
ever had an experience like that or know
of anything like that let me know I
would love to try a better version of
what I experienced this week no he's got
a shotgun I'm gonna stay away from you I
should have oh my god
all right yeah I'm okay oh my god I suck
I suck I'm gonna cut this part out I
hope I hope Jeff joins me in the middle
of this run I was like hey Kyle let me
make this whole area a million times
easier for you I know Paul started
playing this recently he had played like
when it first came out and then he
stopped for a long time and I saw him on
last night but I was unable to play I
was watching
Netflix and stuff yeah
I probably will be having a video with
him and my other buddies pretty soon
I'll be fine I'll be good times
I'm empty oh it's so sad
don't say that assassin you have people
that care about you I think I'm ready
for Flint guys what do you think and
yeah once again I've never taken on
Flint alone I was with my buddy Jeff the
first time I took him on and now he's
gonna be even more tough and more insane
than he usually is ooh
yes I'm gonna take that I have a feeling
that is gonna help me kill him this
round Oh God
much scarier when you're by yourself so
hot when I'm done with you baby burn
oh yeah flames shoot out of the ground
on this level so I gotta be aware of
that take him out
run around run around oh god oh god no
no that is not cool man not cool what if
I can just snipe Captain Flint from up
here that'd be awesome
feel so safe up here you son of a bitch
oh my god
Wow okay guess I'm not that safe up
there apparently oh wow okay okay I'm
done messing around see those were just
I was just warming up it's the first
time I played Borderlands today showing
you guys uh
what not to do consider this a tutorial
a little code monkey all right and my
shield is down I'm gonna die okay no I'm
dead I'm totally dead wow I totally
thought I had him that time okay you
know it's okay I got this
almost almost got him I think I got him
to sign I guess
oh god here we go here we go oh no I
hate the bird and I hate the burn this
is only good if you're in aerobics oh no
come on no come on oh my god okay
This Is It this is it right here this is
it
come on come on you son of a gun no I'm
at an M Oh No did you see how close I
was little bit
Wow now I'm mad the rest of this let's
play is gonna be very quiet because I'm
genuinely pissed off now
Oh Just Breathe cow woosah hey what's up
dude you want some coffee or something
we could just hang out okay um-hmm right
yeah okay so things have just gotten
from bad to horrible in like five
seconds flat I was gonna kill him just a
second ago and now as you can see
channel your anger Kyle
Anna let all right yeah rachel is having
an extremely difficult time with Flint's
as well I recall she was pretty upset at
him at work the other day she was trying
to take him on alone and wasn't working
out for her either I was like you know
it's probably not a problem you probably
just doing it wrong yeah
totally not at all the case all right
see now I have a shield down and I was
getting confident before like oh I have
a shield and I basically want already
but that's not the case I still got to
be very cautious of his AoE attacks like
that okay because I really don't know
the extent of how they work I don't know
if it I know it definitely attacks
horizontally on a horizontal plane but
I'm not sure if it can reach me up here
but I'm gonna treat it like it can I
don't die again does it okay
it doesn't attack me when I'm up here
just don't jump up here and ruin my day
do not do not do that Yayo trying really
hard enough to scream extremely loud
into the mic right now because will hurt
your ears but I am I have defeated the
Flint just like that so I don't I don't
think that deal still going on but let
me know if you guys oh my god that's not
cool man
you don't just throw rocks at people and
kill me uh Jeff oh yeah this is my buddy
Jeff he also does some Let's Plays he's
actually the og let's player he started
wait long long before I did
9q and he does a lot of more a lot more
games than just Borderlands 2 he does
like ex-con he's been doing ex-con
lately he does a lot of stuff he does a
lot of like old retro games as well he
should check him out his YouTube channel

Anita sent me or Kyle from new egg I
will take either but yeah thanks for
thanks for joining me after I killed
Flint Jeff perfect timing he probably
just saw that I was finding Flint is
like oh hell no I'm gonna join Kyle
right after he kills them Oh

I don't not know but I don't like it
Oh Jeff's down I'm gonna help him if I
can
