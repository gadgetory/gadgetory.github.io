to you by fantex and cable mock click
the links in the description below for
more info what's up guys so continuing
our coverage of CES 2018 I got to stop
by the EVGA suite and they had some cool
stuff to show off for starters I got to
check out their next-generation
SC 15 laptop this thing is super slim
sort of builds upon the last gen SC 15
which had a GTX 1060 that's now been
upgraded to a gtx 1070 max Q so that's
lovely
8th gen CPU most likely they weren't
able to really give me full details on
the actual processor but I think it's
pretty safe to assume but that's the
route that they're gonna go they did
confirm that it was Intel so chances are
it's gonna be a hexa core CPU in here
together with that 1070 it's gonna be
quite a powerful machine in a very slim
profile the CPU and GPU are gonna be
using the same cooling solution is found
in the last generation laptop simply
because according to EVGA the new
components aren't gonna be giving off
that much more heat they don't do you
would think that they'd get a lot hotter
than that than their predecessors but
apparently not not so much that's nice
now I didn't get all the details on the
display itself but I can tell you that
it's gonna be 15 inches and support
g-sync
so very buttery smooth playback no
tearing or anything like that I'm
imagining it's still 1080p like the last
gen which is fine because that'll save
some battery life and it also allows
EVGA to bump up the refresh rate to I
think it's still 120 120 Hertz on the
last model it's at least 120 again maybe
1 144 at the very least most gamers
won't even be able to tell between the
two to be honest and either one is gonna
be very very smooth this is gonna be
launching at the end of March right
around the corner so stay tuned for that
next up we've got tube elbows I'm just
calling them to bell bows because EVGA
hasn't even picked out a name for these
yet but they're little other though
they're used for shaping the the tubes
of your AIO coolers for example so you
know if you if you're sick of your your
nasty tubes just hanging out of your
case like someone's entrails then this
is the product for you um but you know
also from a functional standpoint maybe
your tubes are resting or pushing up
against the back plate of your GPU
causing it to sag more or maybe it's
running into your rear exhaust fan which
is obviously not very good when it's
trying to spin up so you know and they
they look pretty hideous honestly when
women when all the colors are mismatched
like they had a demo but that was just
to show that they're being sold in a
variety of colors and I guess the other
benefit here depending on who you ask is
that it sort of gives you more of a
rigid tube look if that's the kind of
thing you're into I'm obviously it's not
going to be perfectly straight and
angled but it definitely subdues some of
those bodacious curves that we otherwise
see on our AIO tubes coming q2 next up
we've got the z10 mechanical gaming
keyboard this is actually going to be
featuring kale blue or kale brown
switches and it's got a built-in LCD
very very very attention-grabbing that
shows various precision steps from the
precision software of course like your
GPU clock speeds temperatures and so
forth so that's actually pretty cool for
some nice at a glance monitoring you
don't actually have to have you know
your your window up on your desktop to
view that stuff or like an OSD for
example additionally we've got sliders
for your volume and LED brightness and
there's only red LEDs for now but it is
perky lighting so you could you know
just light up your number keys and WASD
if you want to do a gaming profile or
something like that you get four
multimedia buttons in the top right
corner and five macro no seven macro
keys five on the left side of the
keyboard and to actually right next to
the arrow keys so that's very nice a
magnetic wrist rest which can be removed
fully if you don't like it or you can
actually pop it out at varying distances
away from the keyboard just to make sure
that you're fully supported and
maximizing the comfort for your wrists
and finally my favorite feature of this
keyboard is the two feet at the bottom
that you can pull out to sort of give a
give a nice little incline for more
ergonomic typing those can be popped out
with two quick release buttons which
just sort of flips them out really
quickly it's very fun to do I've tested
it myself
yeah the HOS perfect and above all else
it makes a great accessory for any coin
purse you can expect this keyboard to
arrive sometime in q1 of this year
moving on to our final product here is
the supernova 2200 p2 that's a 2200 watt
power supply
holy smokes with an 80 plus platinum
rated efficiency a 12 volt rail with 183
amps of output this thing is an absolute
monster I don't think I've ever seen the
power supply with this much wattage
I feel like 2018 seems to be the year of
mining PS use I've seen a lot of other
competitors so far releasing these units
with very high wattage high efficiency
and fully modular design of course which
makes things a little easier for all you
Bitcoin miners out there or crypto
miners in general you do need a 220 volt
output to really take advantage of this
thing at all
so-sorry United States you I don't know
you'll have to MacGyver something to
actually use this I really don't even
know how quiet the fan runs because EVGA
couldn't plug it in at their suite so
haha that's funny
so those are all the things that I
wanted to talk about at the EVGA suite
guys let me know what you think in the
comments below as always feel free to
toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it thank you all for watching
and I will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
