a new low profile cooler from be quiet
this is their shadow rock LP the LP
standing firt and low profile
now generally low-profile coolers are
great for small form-factor bills making
them a viable solution for things like
HT pcs or portable land rigs typically
the trade-off here for compatibility is
performance due to the cooler smaller
Finn stack so to test this correlation
and see what we can expect in terms of
thermal dissipation
we'll also be comparing this coolers low
temperatures to its bigger brother the
shadow rock slim but first let's have a
closer look the hardware with the fan
mounted the shadow rock LP measures 137
millimeters wide by 161 long by just 74
millimeters tall making it short enough
to fit in a wide variety of mini ITX
cases despite having a 25 millimeter
thick fan if you do the math that makes
the heatsink alone just 49 millimeters
tall all of today's popular AMD and
intel sockets are supported by the
shadow rock LP and you do get all the
mounting accessories and instructions
required for installation a generous TDP
of 130 watts means plenty of cooling
capacity for most overclocked CPUs
although I'd still recommend double
checking that you're not exceeding this
crucial limit blowing hot air away from
the heatsink is be quiet very own peer
wings to 120 millimeter fan which
features a rifle bearing design for an
80,000 our lifespan 9 silenced optimized
blades that spin at 1500 rpm and a 4 pin
pwm connector the other half of the
cooler is made up of an aluminum
heatsink sporting 48 fins with a
beautiful brushed aluminum edge where we
can see the ends of our 4 6 millimeter
copper heat pipes it should be pretty
evident to most of us by now that be
quiet knows how to make an air cooler
look good though as a personal aesthetic
preference I really do love it when
manufacturers use nickel-plated heat
pipes which look far superior to me than
copper steampunk modders I mean no
offense please lower your pocket watch
the pipes make their way through the
entire fin array before entering the
copper base plate which comes pre
applied with a layer of thermal paste
inconveniently adding an additional step
to the installation process now while a
low-profile heatsink helps to solve
issues with K square
they're often whiter profile can
potentially cause interference with your
memory as such you only get 30
millimeters of ram clearance for any
modules going underneath the heatsink so
pairing this cooler with a low-profile
kit is highly advisable since I was
using dims with taller heat spreaders in
my testing I actually had to rotate the
cooler 90 degrees which allowed just
enough space for my 4x4 kit although in
this orientation the cooler still
overhangs the two DIMM slots closest to
the socket stopping any chance of me
adding an identical quad channel kit
another shortcoming of this rotated
configuration is that the heatsink now
overhangs the top PCI Express slot on my
x99 you d4p which could indicate even
bigger problems if you're building in a
mini ITX rig with dedicated graphics
much to my relief installing the cooler
on socket 2011 was much easier than the
nightmare I had with the shadow rock
slim a simple mounting bracket held in
place by two easily-accessible screws
does a nice job of securing the cooler
in place while I tighten the screws with
a screwdriver you also have the option
to use the included wrench which is
somewhat improved over the wrench that
came with my shadow rock slim it's now
thinner features an angled tip and has a
longer reach which is what she said
still the screwdriver proved to be the
better tool for the job snapping the fan
to the heatsink with the two metal
brackets was also done with little
difficulty making for an overall quick
and hassle-free installation now at this
point just about everything on the
shadow rock LP looks great on paper but
it was only after firing up the test bed
and seeing its performance when it earns
my full respect for a fair comparison I
removed the lp's pre-applied thermal
paste and used cooler masters ice fusion
compound for both coolers each model is
tasked with cooling by 59 60 X
overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz at one
point to 6 volts in my open air test bed
though I was ready for testing I was
unprepared for the results I was about
to see though it did run 4 degrees
hotter than the shadow rock slim when
idling cooling performance was identical
during my prime 95 stress test skeptical
of the numbers I quickly moved on to
Asus reel bench where again the
vertically challenged cooler left me
awestruck matching its Big Brother at a
max temp of 89 degrees Celsius
considering the shadow rock Slim's
larger Finn array and 140 millimeter fan
I was absolutely shocked with the lp's
ability to maintain the same low temps
however if your performance is
the only factor you're looking for
you'll be doubly impressed to know that
the LP also stayed whisper-quiet under
load here's a sound comparison between
the two coolers
as you can probably tell the pier winks
- runs noticeably quieter than the 140
millimeter silent wings - fan on the
shadow rock slim even under load in an
open-air chassis I could barely hear the
faint War of the shadow rock LP / the
light stream of cars
softly whizzing by my house another test
barring unexpectedly welcome results and
that ladies and gentlemen brings us to
the conclusion apart from its high
quality parts and contemporary Flair the
shadow rock LP does what it promises by
being a cool and quiet low-profile
solution for even the most high end of
CPUs noise generated by the pier wings -
is sure to be near inaudible inside of
an enclosed case and builders can expect
to see more than satisfactory
performance not just for a low-profile
cooler but as an air cooler in general
the only real thing I could nitpick
about was the lack of slim fan support
and non nickel-plated heat pipes - minor
critiques that could easily go unnoticed
given the results I've seen today I'd
even go so far as to say that the shadow
rock LP would be a good fit for mid
tower case if not for the scattered
airflow from having a downward-facing
fan this cooler has the whole package
and for an attractive retail price of
just 45 USD it's a tough candidate to
ignore for your next Mini ITX system
