quick and dirty because I got to throw
something together for you all before I
head to Vegas for the weekends it's very
very hard job that I have but hopefully
this video will still be informative and
interesting to you guys basically what
I'm talking about today is custom
sleeved extensions there's a bunch of
different options now on the market then
there ever have been and I know there's
just it can be kind of confusing like
what do you go if you go with cable mod
do you go with up here or Asia force or
silverstone or BitFenix or whatever the
hell this is or do I go with like a
third-party independent you know like
dude who works from home and stuff what
do you do what do you do so there's a
lot of different options here and I've
pretty much worked with all these types
before several times in the past so I
thought I'd be kind of cool to share
with you my experience with each of
these options so that maybe you can
decide what's best for you for your
current system or maybe a future build
hello
hey Josh I left my define s and our six
in the same room together last night and
now there's a third case like what's
going on baby let me guess it's got a
PSU shroud flexible yeah actually wait
hold on how do two computer cases you
know make a baby
I don't have time to explain this to you
you need to know how humans do it first
I gotta go okay
okay I gotta ask you guys do you like
touch dust filters or something is Lube
even non-conductive is there thermal
paste involved and if so you know where
does it go now stay on silent okay good
talk just wrap it up next time I'm
running out of space the define us to
from fractal design features front panel
USB see ample water cooling support and
a clean interior layout for your next
custom build click the link below to
learn more so let's get into it I'm
gonna start from this side and we'll
work our way down now this type of
extension right here is what I refer to
as the cheap stuff these can be bought
in sets for your entire system for like
30 to 35 bucks that includes a 24 pin
cable that includes your 8 pin EPS for
your CPU and usually 4 cables for your
graphics card so 2 8 pins and 2 6 pins
depending on your configuration you're
covered for the most part they are
incredibly affordable but you get what
you pay for at the same time so they're
relatively cheap in in build quality and
just sort of the materials that they use
like the sleeping for example on a lot
of these are three millimeters thick the
actual sleeve not the wire the gauge is
like the gauge of wire is probably like
18 AWG or whatever but the actual
sleeving is like three millimeters thick
there abouts and it makes them just kind
of frail like and also you can see that
there's like wide gaps between each of
the each of the cables even with a cable
comb in fact the cable Co makes it more
obvious but I think the bigger downside
to having these cables be so thin is
that they get bent out of shape very
easily and once they're bent it's very
hard if not impossible to get them
looking straight again so you can see
even with the cable comb like this
thing's been through the wringer and the
wires now have have sort of bent in such
a way where no amount of cable combing
makes them look all that straight or
pretty anymore you're also pretty
limited with this type of extension in
terms of its physical attributes like
they're all sold with a set length for
the extensions which I believe this is
like 300 centimeters so you can't
customize that you can't cut
as the the actual connector colors some
places let you do that you're just stuck
with black or whatever it is it's
usually black you also usually don't get
cable comes included with these sets I
had to add this one separately but the
reason why these still have a place on
the market is because they are so dirt
cheap and anyone can afford them so in
my experience I would I would reserve
these types of cables for for all the
budget builds out there who have ketchup
and mustard cables from their stock
power supply wires if you have like a
$500 gaming PC that happens to have like
a side panel window and you've got those
nasty red and yellow and purple cables
sticking out and just giving you
nightmares
then these are a really great option
because you don't really want to spend
more than 30 or so dollars on upgrading
the aesthetics of a $500 gaming PC that
could definitely be put to better better
use like upgrading your your GPU your
memory or you know getting an SSD and
there something like that
now this next extension is from cable
mod this is one of their Pro Series
cables that I personally customized
myself using their online configurator
and these are I feel like cable mod saw
that there was a need in the market for
premium cables that weren't easily bent
so easily bent out of shape didn't look
so cheap and so they they came around
with their Pro Series cables and these
are much nicer the quality overall is
much better it even has like that
rainbow curve where the the top layer of
cables is a little bit longer than the
the other the other row so that when you
actually bend it the cables come out to
be about the same length there's no
weird excess cabling just keeps it a lot
a lot cleaner things like that nice
attention to detail there you can also
customize this cable from A to Z you can
you can change the individual wire color
you can change the length of your
extension the color of your your
connectors and even the color materials
of your cable combs so it's really great
if you just have a vision that you want
to go with for your system that's
something that's very specific they can
tailor it to your needs now this is
still using I believe the same sort of
paracord kind of fabric II fabric
material so it does it will pick up dirt
and dust and stuff quite easily
especially if it's a lighter color
sleeve then you have to worry about it a
little bit more like if it's all black
then it's really a non-issue but
something to keep in mind but also I
believe cable mod offers the PE T or the
sort of plastic material for their
cables as well now we'll talk more about
the plastics leaving in just a moment
but as for s for these even though these
are paracord very similar material to
our cheapos here they're actually able
to retain their shape a lot better
simply because these are thicker sleeves
these are I think five or six
millimeters thick almost twice the
thickness of this cable and you can kind
of tell that you're not getting many of
those gaps in between your cables with
the cable mod Pro Series cable they're
just closer together and because they're
thicker gauge they actually hold their
shape a lot better so overall these are
cables that I would trust in like a Shou
rig these Pro extensions from cable mod
I feel are definitely up to the
challenge in both in both looks and in
performance and sort of quality there so
now the trade-off here is of course
price for the amount that you would
spend on an entire set of these cheap
cables you could probably only afford
this single 24 pin ATX cable so yeah
maybe like 30 to 35 bucks for a single
cable but again the quality the looks
the customizability it's gonna make a
massive difference so of course there's
a massive price hike as well
unfortunately but that's just how it
goes
worth every penny in my opinion if you
really care about the look of your
system next we've got these beauties and
these are actually part of the same
category and for the record this does
not showcase every single option of
custom cables out there it does however
I think paint a pretty good picture of a
lot of the popular options that are
available so let's talk about these
these are from two different brands
actually so this is up here that's the
name of the brand up here and this is
from a company called Asia horse I
believe both of them are Chinese
companies and the extensions from both
of these companies are using PT plastics
leavings so you can see they're much
straighter right off the bat
than any of the paracord options here
and they just retained their shape
incredibly well and that's because the
the plastic material just makes them
really stiff overall and so they're able
to just hold that shape which is great I
mean the cable combs just slide up and
down them very easily because it's kind
of more slippery material and these have
about the same sort of sleeving
thickness in diameter as the cable my
Pro Series cables so there's very
minimal gaps between each of the wires
which which looks quite nice now these
are limited however in very much the
same way that these cheapo cables are in
a sense where you know they're just kind
of like preset packages or sets of
cables where they have a predetermined
length you know you can't customize the
the cable combs or the connector colors
or the material like like you can with
cable mud Pro Series so that's something
to bear in mind but for most builders
the colors that are offered here is
gonna cover 90 percent of enthusiasts
you know they've got white and black and
red so it's gonna cover most people but
you won't be able to get fully
customized down to the wire like you
could with some more expensive options
and what's amazing about these Chinese
cables is that the quality seems pretty
solid you know I've been using these
cables from probably the least amount of
time compared to these other options on
the table here but I haven't encountered
any quality concerns so far there was
actually one I'm sorry
there was one cable here where the it
looked like it just didn't get heated
properly and so it's kind of the sleeve
is sort of recessing you can sort of see
some of the underwire not the actual
copper or anything but just the the
outer protective layer of that wire is
showing a little bit exposed but it's
honestly not too bad I did also notice
on the product page for I think it was
the 8 some of the Asia Horse cables some
users very very rarely but some users
were actually seeing their cables able
to pull out which should never happen I
made sure to tug on all my Asia Horse
cables right before this video and
they're all perfectly secure in there no
issues whatsoever so I think some of
those users just got really unlucky
pretty much the same price
as these guys which you know I changed
my answer these cables are becoming
increasingly obsolete if they aren't
already because you can buy an entire
set of much higher quality and
better-looking cables that are much
easier to train for the same price you
can buy I bought an entire set of these
black and red ones I can actually show
them to your 32 or 33 bucks for for all
these cables came in a set obviously
again can't you can't you know customize
how long they are or other various
properties the cable combs are a little
on the cheap side they're kind of clear
and plasticky sort of reflective able to
call that nice you can easily take them
off though and add your own but I mean
come on
$32 for the entire set like don't even
don't even buy these anymore I take back
everything I said about these that was
positive because honestly I like these
cables so much more these is just as my
own my own opinions here now to be fair
I do give these plastic PT sleeves a lot
of credit a lot of high praise but one
thing that the paracord sleeve is better
at doing inherently is being able to
turn or being able to bend more tightly
you can do tighter bends with this sort
of fabric material than you can with the
plastic because again like I said
plastic is very stiff which makes it
really easy to train but also kind of
difficult if you want to bend it really
tight so if you're dealing with like a
small form-factor build for example and
you're trying to bend around some really
tight corners or something like that
then maybe you want to consider going
with like a paracord and a more nylon
type of sleeping the last type of cables
that I've worked with extensively in the
past are the extensions that are made
and handcrafted by small independent
businesses these are like you know just
a single guy or maybe like a small group
of guys or girls working in either their
house or small office perhaps and they
just they really enjoy sleeving cables
and they're damn good at it
this particular cable was sent over by
woz mods I've worked with him in the
past he does fantastic work all these
guys do and I'll link their stuff in the
description below along with these two
because these all meet a different type
of use case scenario depending on the
user but these guys all pump out such
amazing quality work definitely a cut
above everything on the table that you
see here and they're highly customizable
just like the cable my Pro Series cables
are but even more so a lot of the cable
colors the colors and different patterns
that a lot of these guys offer you won't
find anywhere else and all the other
standard stuff like extension length and
a cable comb material and color and
which way your connectors are facing
that's all adjustable for a lot of these
guys as well and you can also change
things like the material of your sleeve
like you can do PT you can do paracord a
lot of these guys will have various
options so really I would recommend
these cables to anyone who a has the
money to spend because they're not cheap
and be really wants to make a statement
with their system that they want to
build the next hot line or the next
skunkworks
they want their system to look like it
belongs on the CES show floor and they
also want that unique spark of
individuality with whatever
custom colors or patterns or designs
that they've configured themselves or
with the help of one of the experts so
that's pretty much these different cable
options in a nutshell I hope I you know
kind of did an okay job of explaining my
experience with each of them which
hopefully helps you I understand this
video was in no means scientific it's
all highly subjective but at the very
least I hope it helped and if it did
feel free to tell us like on the video
it helps me a lot and get subscribed for
more weird stuff like this guys thank
you so much for tuning in you can also
check me out on floatplane if you'd like
to watch my videos a whole week early
without ads for three bucks a month I'll
put a link for that in the video
description before you go before I go
let me know do you guys currently use
any sort of custom cables or sleeved
extensions in your systems if so do they
belong to either of these categories and
how is that working out for you feel
free to share your experience down below
so we can all sort of learn from it and
again thanks for watching guys I'll see
you in the next one
