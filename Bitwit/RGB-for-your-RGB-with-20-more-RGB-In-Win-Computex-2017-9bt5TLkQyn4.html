to you by be quiet cable mod verda gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info how's it going
guys
just me feeling here in my garage I know
I know it's not my garage like what the
hell is this even like what I don't even
I don't even understand well actually
the guys didn't tried to explain it to
me and I feel I'm not exactly sure why
it exists but rest assured there will be
a limited quantity of things that you
could actually buy it's essentially a
computer case of course that's what
anyone's really known for but it sort of
turned left to right and it can take
pictures there's like a pair of cameras
that's in front of it which I honestly
don't even know where the front is that
that's probably the back actually so you
can you can hook it up like an Amazon
alexa unit and do some voice control you
can have it turn based on your voice
take pictures when you tell it to and
then it can synchronize with your
facebook page and upload pictures of
social media like i said i don't know
why we need something like this but then
again this isn't really meant to be
practical it's just sort of to show the
world just how crazy people in win' are
now this thing is friggin beautiful in
wind calling this via the don't touch so
I think I'm a big fan of the don't touch
right now unfortunately it's just a
concept probably not going to come to
market at least for now
but the one thing they were showing off
is all of these addressable LED mounting
plates behind the SSD behind the
motherboard behind the radiator solution
which is pretty much going to
synchronize with addressable LED strips
in your system if you were to actually
implement this into a more standard case
like being wind 101 on one here I think
it would look pretty sweet I think this
is a great idea oh I didn't realize the
power supply has one too so obviously
addressable LEDs is like the new thing
the person was just RGB and everyone is
going addressable now with the GTS and
MSI and all the other board partners
shaking things up those fans
I believe the fans are addressable as
well
that's pretty sweet I give it six months
before we start to see these LED strips
not just from inland but from every
single case manufacturer in every single
case that comes out in 2017 onwards it's
just uh it's gotten out of hand people
it's gotten out of hand
or has it so sexy come on like give me
some exactly though this is a gaming
cube a one and at first I thought I said
the Gamecube a one I was like nah bro
that that names already taken but
actually look at this it's a small form
factor obviously Mini ITX it's got a
really nice white finish on the front
this is all about aesthetics here
sort of have like a transparent base
that's the kind of unique looking RGB
LED of course looks like it can do a
number of different effects and on the
top here you've got a super just
unexpected really beautiful wooden
finish power button 2 USB 3 audio
microphone headphone jack USB 3.1 type C
and it looks like you get some
ventilation on the right side here I
believe that's a power supply or maybe
that's true no that's a regular fan
that's an air fan so era case fan I
should say they're all all fans or air
fans Kyle come on get with it
small form-factor power supply I believe
they said it's going to come included
sfx form factor 500 watts 80 plus
certified i believe and wouldn't be
surprised if it's an inland brand or it
could be om not sure i'm sure about that
yet but here just to look at the
internal layout you ports have room for
a full size graphics card to get in
there window all dirty hopefully i have
a cleaning service to wipe up all my
mess and then we get the rear fan over
there looks like a 120 looks like you
might have no no room for a 140 just a
120 120 while you get feel of it but the
reason i really like this case is cuz
we've seen other obscene competitor
cases that are about this size that can
fit to sort of hardware but they neglect
to put fan options at the bottom of the
case for the graphics card and with
limited airflow coming from the front
you really are out of luck if you
don't have any sort of airflow going to
your GPU at that point from that angle
so it's kind of nice that you have the
option for two 120 s right there and it
doesn't look like there's any radiator
support so in case you were doing some
custom water cooling you might want to
look elsewhere but overall free sweet
gaming cube a one look for it very soon
in a store dr you now you guys remember
the 805 writes in one 805 it's sort of
built upon that is the 806
it's one it's one number higher so
obviously it's better do you see they've
sort of taken after this nice little
wooden theme here again like we saw just
would be a gaming cube a1 we've got a
nice wooden finish that goes all around
sort of a seamless sort of just one
piece of wood that goes that wraps
around the top in front and it just
gives a really stylized look this
wouldn't go great in sort of a modern
home that's way more expensive than the
one I live in but look at this tempered
glass side panel but where the hell are
little screws there's no there's no
through some screws or anything to open
this guy so this is actually a quick
release model or a quick release design
that's you don't actually need to mess
around with the screws which I really
like because the one bad thing one of
the bad things about tempered glass is
any time you have to remove the panel it
takes a lot of time and you also risk
getting fingerprints on the areas where
the screws are so what since you get
just sort of a nice clean elegant and
efficient solution for getting into your
system maybe doing some service
maintenance and things like that also
we've got plenty of weightier support at
the front there looks like a 240 no
that's a 280 yo at the 280 and we do
have some removable dust filters that
are magnetic at the front and the bottom
so you get plenty of airflow their full
ATX power supply fully ATX motherboard
supports I would imagine EA TX as well
140 at the back not long enough to 120 I
can't I can't even see it ok just
confirm that is the one pointing at the
back there we've got a couple more 120
at the top so who like you can do
radiator support at the top but
definitely at the front and it looks
pretty good it looks like there's also
some options here for reservoir pump etc
altogether a pretty solid little system
here in the 806 and alekhya tethers a
little bit of the space between the
wooden panel and it can't be it's belt
obviously they wear a lot of ventilation
intake is going to come from beautiful
beautiful
we have a top bio here look how clean
this is of course you wouldn't expect
anything less from the folks over at
anyone gets a really nice aluminum
finish even in really high in cases
these days the IO is still sort of
plasticky and this gets a lot of
interaction with the user right you're
plugging things in constantly or
pressing the power button to reset I
usually rarely ever turn my computer off
but some people do in that case it's
nice to have just a little bit more high
quality finish and material when it
comes to the front I oh and it does
match very nicely with the wood finish
ok
this is called Mars this is a pretty
interesting concept actually and I'm
sort of looking forward to maybe trying
one of these out back at home but
essentially what it is is it allows you
to mount this sort of system here to any
120 millimeter fan because you know that
they expand that a little bit but for
now you can actually mount this pretty
much any fan in your system
you're basically mounting a fan to
another fans like yo dawg i heard you
like fans so he put a fan on your fans
and you cool all you cool that type of
thing but what's really cool about this
is that you can sort of position its on
sort of a multiple axis X exists and if
you look over here you can actually
position the fan and pretty much any
orientation or position you want inside
of your case for optimal cooling now
obviously one of the hottest places in
any gaming system is going to be the GPU
so here they've actually configure two
of these guys perfectly set to cool the
the back of the PCB and even where the
the card in takes fresh air so that you
can actually lower some bowls quite a
bit it's pretty sweet actually let me
know what you guys think of this design
you know obviously it's a little bit
different it kind of like is I grabbing
it first and it might be off-putting to
some but I think it's a really good
implementation if you're just talking
performance and cooling and I really do
like the fact they've even added some
more Flair with an RGB or not RGB but
just a red LED here with the red blade I
would like to see an RGB version myself
personally we'll see if they actually
oblige though in the future so stay
tuned for Mars once again coming soon
all right guys that's going to wrap it
up for my coverage here at the in win
booth at Computex 2017 I want to say a
huge shout out once again to all my
sponsors for making this trip possible
Kable mod be quite berta gear and EVGA
go ahead and check out their stuff in
the description below otherwise I'll see
