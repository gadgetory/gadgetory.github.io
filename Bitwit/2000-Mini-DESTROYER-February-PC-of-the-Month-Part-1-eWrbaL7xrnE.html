channel today we are assembling
February's pc of the month this is gonna
be insane the objective of today's build
is to cram just about as much power and
speed into a small small tiny little
itty bitty footprint and we're gonna be
doing that by way of the end case m1 a
chassis that I've had my eye on since
the day it ever arrived on the internet
I saw this a couple years back and I was
like I need it but I never got a chance
to actually get one it was just very
hard to find by the time I tried looking
for one and I just I just never I just
never got around to building them
unfortunately my good old buddy and PAL
crafty hack offered to send me his as a
loaner so that I could do a build with
one so that's very nice of him thank you
so much crafty go ahead and follow him
on Twitter
he'll totally send you any case you want
crafty also sent me the replacement
panel so that you can actually make the
case either black or silver to your
liking and I really couldn't decide so I
threw up a poll on Twitter and even
though it was really close in the end
you guys voted for black so we're gonna
be building in a black and case m14
today our CPU of choice that we're
rocking today is none other than the
Intel Core i7 7700 K KB Lake processor
this is a quad core chip that is hyper
threaded so we got eight threads on this
bad boy which is not going to be just
great for gaming but also multi-threaded
applications like video editing as well
this is almost chalking up to be a 2.0
version of the go anywhere do anything
PC that I did not too long ago sometime
last year with the fractal design no 202
this this system that we're building
today is definitely gonna give that one
a run for its money on top of that we're
also slotting that CPU into a beautiful
motherboard this is the Asus Strix Z 270
I gaming Mini ITX mobo and this is one
of the boards that I saw at seus that I
was just super super fond of I was like
this is a nice board
I want one Gary and Gary was like I'm
gonna give it to you and then now I have
one so now I get to build with it I'm
very excited features RGB or a lighting
all that sort of thing that's got an RGB
header on it as well even the USB 3.1
header which is really nice for a mini
ITX board for sure it's also got m2 nvme
support so this is a full-featured board
that looks really nice as well it's got
a kind of a neutral color scheme with
some silver accents so it's sure to
match all the other components in our
system
moving right along I've got to give a
huge shout out to the folks over at OCC
for hooking it up with a killer storage
selection for today's build will be used
their flagship m2 nvme drive which is
their Rd 400 and that's in a one
terabyte capacity this thing is an
absolute beast
it gets up to 2600 megabytes per second
sequential reads and 1.6 or I should say
1600 megabytes per second sequential
writes which is absolutely awesome so
we're gonna be using that today for
mainly our scratch disk if we are gonna
be editing it's nice to have really fast
sequential writes for sure and then on
top of that we're also rocking one of
their VX 500 drives this is just a SATA
simple two and a half inch drive but
still does a really good job as a boot
drive and just loading up basic
applications in our operating system for
memory we've got 16 gigs or a 2 by 8 gig
kit of corsair dominator Platinum's at
3000 megahertz these is actually the
same sticks that I used in January's PC
of the month but I just thought I would
carry them over for this month because
they're gonna look really nice with this
motherboard and the other component that
we've got in here plus they're just
really reliable and fast sticks next up
we've got the coarser H one hundred-eyed
GTX v2 which is a 240 millimeter liquid
AO that we are gonna be stuffing inside
of the end case m1 I am super excited to
do this if we're gonna be overclocking
the 7700 K which can hit easily 5
gigahertz and get fairly hot by doing
that we are gonna need some nice cooling
potential in there so this is gonna be
keeping thermals in check hopefully and
allowing us to hit some decent
overclocks without throttling random
things out here we've got a 600 watt SFX
series power supply from good old
silverstone this is an awesome unit
that's 80 plus gold and fully modular
with flat black cables so no no none of
that nasty ketchup and mustard that
we're used to seeing sometimes on my PC
and things like that this is a really
solid and very reliable units I've never
had any issues with the 500 watt model
that I used in my wall-mounted overkill
console killer build that I did a few
years back so very excited to be using
this one today and last but certainly
not least is our graphical weapon of
choice which is the gtx 1070 mini from
gigabyte
now I specifically wanted this card
because it's super short the PCB on it
is probably no more than 6 inches long
and yet it has a very decent cooler on
it for the size it only has one single
fan but as we'll probably see in part 2
of this video when I do thermal testing
and things like that I've read several
reviews that have all praised how
effective this little cooler is for
being the size that it is and being able
to pack in
that much horsepower allow the gtx 1070
is exactly what we're going for for
today's build so those are all the parts
guys there's no cable sleeping in this
one because it's already pretty cramped
in the m1 plus the matte black cables on
the sfx unit are just fine but all that
aside I'm just super pumped to be
building this little tiny rig featuring
the phenomenal lineup of hardware behind
me
by the way I'll put links in the
description below for all the stuff
that's there if you want to check it out
and yeah that's pretty much it guys sit
back relax maybe say a prayer to the PC
gods for me as I build this thing and
I'll see you all on the other side
you
so here she is here's the bailed pretty
straightforward and I got the beer
bottle out there just for scale so you
can really get a feel for how tiny this
case really is it was surprisingly easy
to work in despite being such a tiny
compact area you can see here this is
probably the most cramped angle cramped
looking angle of the entire build is
from the top down you can see that the
radiator went in no problem there's
still actually a bunch of clearance for
the fans but what I overlooked was that
the H one hundred-eyed GTX v2 has some
really thick tubes that I didn't account
for so it was actually really hard
trying to press down this the side panel
radiator bracket and get that all
screwed in properly because those tubes
were just so thick and of course they're
long they're long for a case this size
so I'll have to take that into
consideration next time I'm building in
something like this but other than that
everything went pretty smoothly you can
see I've got actually an allen wrench
that's just being used as a crutch right
now to prop up one of those tubes
because it was pushing down on the PCB
of the graphics card and actually
pressurizing a little bit more flex than
I would have liked it to so Helen wrench
is just there as a temporary fix to keep
things upright and then you can see I've
also and I also edited in a cougar fan
this is just 120 millimeter cougar fan
these are really quiet and very well
performing had this fan for like five
years but I haven't used it in probably
four but that's just provided as an
intake getting some fresh air flow to
the graphics card just to hopefully
lower the thermals a bit more than
otherwise and everything else was good
the m2 SSD went in there no problem
everything went in just very smoothly so
I'm happy how this went guys let me know
if you would like me to try my hand at
custom water cooling inside of this
thing I know it's been done before I've
looked up the Google Images and it seen
some pretty nice-looking builds and
actually crafty sent me this along with
the along with the case which is a
dedicated reservoir that is tailor-made
for the in case m1 and it actually
mounts to the outside of the case on the
back like so and then you can run some
tubes through the water cooling grommets
there I guess the only challenge then
would be finding places for the radiator
which I would imagine would go at the
bottom of the case and then of course
the pump the pump would probably maybe
have to mount at the front somewhere I'd
have to get creative with it or you can
get one of those water blocks that have
a built-in pump that could be a solution
too but you can see there's really
minimal space here for radiator I mean
this is just a 120 fan right here we've
already got like just a couple
millimeters of clearance between the fan
and a graphics card but bear in mind if
we put a custom block on the 1080 or any
card for that matter for the most part
you're gonna be minimizing or lessening
the width of that card so it actually be
a single slot card more or less and that
would give us a little bit more
clearance at the bottom for a radiator
and maybe some slim fans so I'll have to
I'll have to go back to the drawing
board for that one but let me know if
that's something you'd like to see but I
think that's pretty much gonna do it for
now guys be sure to stay tuned for part
two where I test acoustics thermals and
of course gaming benchmarks with this
guy I think it's gonna be pretty
exciting to see how much power we can
drive out of this little tiny tiny
little system here so this was a lot of
fun thank you all so much for watching
be sure to LIKE the video hold on whoa
hold on I really need the camera man be
sure to like the video if you guys
enjoyed it and also feel free to
subscribe to the channel for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon I
promise
have a good one guys and I'll see y'all
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
