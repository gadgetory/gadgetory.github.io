channel today we are assembling
February's pc of the month this is going
to be insane the objective of today's
build is to cram just about as much
power and speed into a small small tiny
little itty-bitty footprint and we're
going to be doing that by way of the N
case m1 Oh Chauncey that I've had my eye
on since the day it ever arrived on the
internet I saw this a couple years back
and I was like I need it but I never got
a chance to actually get one it was just
very hard to find by the time I tried
looking for one and I just I just never
I just never got around to building
fortunately my good old buddy and PAL
crafty hack offered to send me his as a
loaner so I could do a build with one so
that's very nice of him thank you so
much crafty go ahead and follow him on
Twitter
he'll totally send you any case you want
crafty also sent me the replacement
panel so that you can actually make the
case either black or silver to your
liking and I really couldn't decide so I
threw up a poll on Twitter and even
though it was really close in the end
you guys voted for black so we're going
to be building in a black and case m14
today our CPU of choice that we're
rocking today is none other than the
Intel Core i7 7700 K KB Lake processor
this is a quad core chip that is hyper
threaded so we got eight threads on this
bad boy which is not going to be just
great for gaming but also multi-threaded
applications like video editing as well
this is almost chalking up to be a 2.0
version of the go anywhere do anything
PC that I did not too long ago sometime
last year would be fractal design no 202
this system that we're building today is
definitely going to give that one a run
for its money on top of that we're also
slotting that CPU into a beautiful
motherboard this is the Asus Strix Z 270
I Gaming Mini ITX mobo and this is one
of the boards that I saw CIS that I was
just super super fond of I was like this
is a nice board
I want one Gary and Gary was like I'm
going to give it to you and then now I
have one so now I get to build with it
I'm very excited features RGB aura
lighting all that sort of thing that's
got an RGB header on it as well even the
USB 3.1 Tedder which is really nice for
a mini ITX board for sure it's also got
MQ nvme support so this is a
full-featured board that looks really
nice as well it's got a kind of a
neutral color scheme with some silver
accents so it's sure to match all the
other components in our system
moving right along I've got to give a
huge shout out to the folks over at OCC
for hooking it up with a killer storage
selection for today's build we'll be
using there
flagship MDOT to nvme drive which is
their Rd 400 and that's in a one
terabyte capacity this thing is an
absolute beast it gets up to 2600
megabytes per second sequential reads
and 1.6 or I should say sixteen hundred
megabytes per second sequential writes
which is absolutely awesome so we're
gonna be using that today for mainly our
scratch disk if we are going to be
editing it's nice to have really fast
clincial writes for sure and then on top
of that we're also rocking one of their
VX 500 drives this is just a SATA simple
two and a half inch drive but still does
a really good job as a boot drive and
just loading up basic applications in
our operating system for memory we've
got 16 gigs or a 2 by 8 gig kit of
corsair dominator Platinum's at 3000
megahertz this is actually the same
sticks that i used in january pc of the
month but i just thought i would carry
them over for this month because they're
going to look really nice with this
motherboard and the other component that
we've got in here plus they're just
really reliable and fast sticks next up
we've got the corsair H 100 GTX v2 which
is a 240 millimeter liquid AO that we
are going to be stuffing inside of the N
case m1 I am super excited to do this if
we're going to be overclocking the 7700
K which can hit easily 5 gigahertz and
get fairly hot by doing that we are
going to need some nice cooling
potential in there so this is going to
be keeping thermals in check hopefully
and allowing us to hit some decent
overclocks without throttling random
things out here we've got a 600 watt SFX
series power supply from good old
silverstone this is an awesome unit
that's 80 plus gold and fully modular
with flat black cables so none of that
nasty ketchup and mustard that were used
to seeing sometimes on pip my PC and
things like that this is a really solid
and very reliable unit I've never had
any issues with the 500 watt model that
I used in my wall-mounted overkill
console killer bill but I did a few
years back so very excited to be using
this one today and last but certainly
not least is our graphical weapon of
choice which is the gtx 1070 mini from
gigabyte
now I specifically wanted this card
because it's super short the PCB on it
is probably no more than six inches long
and yet it has a very decent cooler on
it for the size it only has one single
fan but as we'll probably see in part 2
of this video when I do thermal testing
and things like that I've read several
reviews that have all praised how
effective this little cooler is for
being the size that it is and being able
to pack in
that much horsepower allowed the GTX
1070 is exactly what we're going for for
today's build so those are all the parts
guys there's no cable sleeping in this
one because it's already pretty cramped
in the m1 plus the matte black cables on
the sfx unit are just fine but all that
aside I'm just super pumped to be
building this little tiny rig featuring
the phenomenal lineup of hardware behind
me by the way all put links in the
description below for all the stuff
that's there if you want to check it out
and yeah that's pretty much it guys sit
back relax maybe say a prayer to the PC
gods for me as I build this thing and
I'll see you all on the other side
you
so here she is here's the bailed pretty
straightforward and I got the beer
bottle out there just for scale so you
can really get a feel for how tiny this
case really is it was surprisingly easy
to work in despite being such a tiny
compact area you can see here this is
probably the most cramped angle cramped
looking angle of the entire build is
from the top down you can see that the
radiator went in no problem they're
still actually a bunch of clearance for
the fans but what I overlooked was that
the H one hundred-eyed GTX v2 has some
really thick tubes that I didn't account
for so it was actually really hard
trying to press down this this side
panel radiator bracket and get that all
screwed in properly because those pubes
were just so thick and of course they're
long they're long for a case of this
size so I'll have to take that into
consideration next time I'm building in
something like this but other than that
everything went pretty smoothly you can
see I've cut her actually an allen
wrench that's just being used as a
crutch right now to prop up one of those
tubes because it was pushing down on the
PCB of the graphics card and actually
pressurizing a little bit more flex than
I would have liked it to so Allen wrench
is just there as a temporary fix to keep
things upright and then you can see I've
also an eye also edited into cougar fans
it's just 120 millimeter cougar fan
these are really quiet very well
performing had this fan for like five
years but I haven't used it in probably
four but that's just provided as an
intake getting some fresh air flow to
the graphics card just to hopefully
lower the thermals a bit more than
otherwise and everything else was good
the m2 SSD went in there no problem
everything went in just very smoothly so
I'm happy how this went guys let me know
if you would like me to try my hand at
custom water cooling inside of this
I know it's been done before I've looked
up the Google Images and have seen some
pretty nice-looking build and actually
cracky sent me this along with the along
with the case which is a dedicated
reservoir that is tailor-made for the N
case m1 and it actually mounts to the
outside of the case on the back like so
and then you can run some tubes to the
water cooling grommets there I guess the
only challenge then would be finding
places for the radiators which I would
imagine would go at the bottom of the
case and then of course the pump the
pump would probably maybe have to mount
at the front somewhere I'd have to get
creative with it or you can get one of
those water blocks that have a built-in
pump that could be a solution too but
you can see there's really minimal space
here for radiator I mean this is just a
120 fan right here we've already got
like just a couple millimeters of
clearance between the fan and a graphics
card but bear in mind if we put a custom
block on the 1080 or any card for that
matter for the most part you're going to
be minimizing or lessening the width of
that card so it actually be a single
slot card more or less and that would
give us a little bit more clearance at
the bottom for a radiator and maybe some
slim fan so I'll have to I'll have to go
back to the drawing board for that one
but let me know if that's something
you'd like to see but I think that's
pretty much going to do for now guys be
sure to stay tuned for part two where I
test the q6 thermals and of course
gaming benchmarks with this guy I think
it's going to be pretty exciting to see
how much power we can drive out of this
little tiny tiny little system here so
this was a lot of fun thank you all so
much for watching be sure to LIKE the
video hold on hold on I really need the
cameraman be sure to like the video if
you guys enjoyed it and also feel free
to subscribe to the channel for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon I
promise
have a good one guys and I'll see y'all
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
