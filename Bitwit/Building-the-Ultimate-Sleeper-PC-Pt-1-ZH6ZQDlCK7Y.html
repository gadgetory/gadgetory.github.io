channel today I'm going to be doing
another build log of course I'm going to
be trying my very best not to be super
shaky with the camera work this time and
though there were several complaints in
the last build video that I did some
reports of nausea and vomiting as well
so hopefully this is a little bit more
stable I'm using my steady hand
but today's build is going to be what
I'm calling a covert sleeper build or a
sleeper PC and what that essentially
means is I'm going to be using a really
craft case in fact my dad's old HP
Pavillion which is right there behind me
but I'm going to be stocking it full of
high-end components you know all current
generation skylake stuff as well as 900
series graphics so pretty sweet the
purpose of this is not to be practical
because it's not you should never do
this and the whole point of this I guess
is to kind of build a system that looks
like crap from the outside but actually
rocks and kicks ass on the inside is
very capable of handling handling a lot
of different workloads for the main
purpose of travel so when you're
traveling you're going to hotels your
any conventions you want to bring your
system along with you but you don't
necessarily want to attract any unwanted
attention so this could actually deter
some potential theft if people just take
your glance at your crappy system to go
out they don't think twice about it when
in fact it's rocks so I guess that's the
point and I have to give a shout out to
somebody on Twitter who gave me this
idea I'm sorry I don't know your name or
your user name it got buried among the
other you know tweets that came after
but thank you for this idea that was
pretty awesome so on that note why don't
we go ahead and check out the hardware
so starting off with my dad's old system
like I said it's it's a clunker I'm
gonna have to take out everything every
single component in here is going to be
taken out I'm gonna clean the whole
thing out make sure it's all nice and
pretty on the inside I I kind of do want
to leave the disheveled look on the
outside I don't know if I'm gonna clean
the outside yet let's hold but that's
the whole point after all but there are
some limitations with an old case like
this for example the i/o sucks and you
get two USB to firewire who uses that
anymore that's that's that's called
Thunderbolt now and then you've got
audio jacks which sure why not
so ya know USB three on the front panel
is is kind of a bummer and I'm so used
to it now that I couldn't really live
without it unless I absolutely had to I
mean first world problems after all so
I'm going to be doing oh it does have a
card reader which is nice but it's USB
too but I have the perfect the absolute
perfect product to to solve this issue
here and it's actually this mighty
charger ECR 501 from NR max this thing
is great I've actually done a review on
this in the past on the channel you can
check it out later if you want but you
can see here it's got USB 3 first off
it's a five and a quarter inch it takes
up a five and a quarter inch band it's
got USB three just one port which is
really all I usually ever need and it's
got five USB 2 which all support quick
charging and then like an even quicker
charging USB port right here if you want
to charge your smartphone or something
like that as well as a SD card reader at
the top which is also USB 3 and finally
the last benefit of this of this this
this item here is that it can also house
a single three and a half inch or two
two and a half inch drives in the back
and it can't really see it from here but
it is it is a dock as well so I'm going
to be installing my one mechanical drive
in the system it's a 2 terabyte WD black
oh yeah that's going to be going right
in the back of there mainly because I'm
getting rid of this hard drive cage
that's that comes installed in this case
the reason why is because it's just
taking up a lot of room and I and
ideally I would like to have some more
intake fans just case fans in in this
system in general because there aren't
really there was an 80 millimeter fan
here set to exhaust but I removed that
and put it in my dad's new system so
right now this has no case fans which is
horrible
so what I'm gonna be doing is gonna be
taking some I'm going to be reusing some
old fans have got a silverstone one
right here it's a 120 I'm gonna try
somehow to mount it to the front of this
case and they take up that hard drive
cage from out the fan here as an intake
and there are no dry there are no fan
mounts at the front here so I'm gonna
have to MacGyver some shit maybe either
zip-tie it or drill some screws or maybe
even try to use one of the pre-existing
holes on the front mesh here if it if it
lines up properly also I've got another
120 here think it's a cooler cooler
master I'm going to set this as another
intake on the side panel so you've got
some ventilation here which goes right
above the CPU I'm going to try to mount
this on the inside of course so I'm like
that's also no dedicate
fan mounting holes so I'm gonna have to
either drill something or find something
to do there so though they're all have
two intakes and then I got this picked
up this eighty millimeter stark tech fan
for like a few bucks on Amazon recently
set that as an exhaust and I think that
should take care of my my airflow in
this in this chassis quite nicely but
where did I leave off on I think I was
talking about the limitations of this
case and other things that I would need
to change the other thing that I need to
change is the power supply this is
obviously the one that it came with its
complete shit so I'm going to go with
this g7 50m from coolermaster the reason
why I like this is not only because it's
partially modular so it helps you know
it's conducive to cable tightness and
that sort of thing but also because it's
the exact same size as the existing
power supply which means I won't have I
won't be sacrificing any kind of cable
clearance once this thing's installed
and 750 should be plenty more than
plenty to drive the system even when
overclocked front and center of our
system is the core i7 6700k yes very
good quad core CPU high-end skylake
stuff good cooling it will be this rows
well since RC zz9 tal now this cooler
isn't probably the the most suited for
overclocking and in my hand it kind of
looks around the same size as an Intel
stock cooler but just for comparison I
have the two side-by-side here and you
can see it's actually quite a bit larger
not just in terms of the heatsink but
the fan as well I think we're going from
80 to a 90 millimeter fan and I have
read some reviews on this cooler you can
do some moderate overclocking and I
think with this 120 millimeter and
intake installed right on top of it I
think we can get some pretty decent
temps despite you know in the face of
overclocking this 6700 K so that's kind
of nice I'm excited to see how that
works out Ram I don't even have eye RAM
over here where's my ram you guys get a
secret look a secret peek at all the
crap that's on on this shelf here I've
got some RAM we're using the 16 gigs
this is just 16 gigs so we've got 2 8
gig sticks of HyperX savage ddr4 Thank
You HyperX for providing this for for
this particular build actually I don't
think they they have any idea what I was
going to use it for but but hopefully
they don't mind me using it for this
this video so this is actually really
nice I like these heat spreaders a lot
the speed on here 2666 maybe I don't
know
I don't know what speed it is it's fast
who cares for the motherboard we've got
a Z 170 m d 3h from gigabyte thank you
to you by for providing this board the
they hopped on last minutes and we're so
generous as to provide a board for this
system it's very nice it's got a black
in black and gold aesthetic with some
some kind of grey in there as well on
the the DIMM slots and the PCIe slots
what I like about this board is that
it's micro ATX which is obviously what I
would need for this case as it is a
micro ATX case and you can see actually
that it's mounted upside down so I'll be
interesting it's kind of different but
the other thing that I like here and
what appeal to me is that it's got an
end to slot that supports not just PCIe
but also SATA drives and that's actually
what I needed because I've already been
holding on to this SP 900 256 gig and 2
SATA SSD from a data for like for like
months now like almost in CES and I
haven't really found a purpose to use it
until now so I'm just going to slum that
in there it's gonna save me some space
in the chassis and everything is gonna
work out there will be no problems there
are never any problems when building
computers ever and then last but not
least we've got a gtx 980ti cuz why the
hell not right umm pretty awesome card
pretty beefy cooler again it's going in
upside-down so what's gonna go something
like this you wouldn't think that a card
of this size I mean this is one of the
larger cards that I have on hand with me
on on hand but you can see right there
it actually goes into a problem yep
I mean hey it works so there you guys go
this is going to be an interesting build
I'm actually kind of excited but also a
little nervous to see what kind of
problems are new challenges that arise
from trying to build in such an old case
that really isn't even designed in any
way shape or form to accommodate you
know current gen hardware such as all
this stuff so now that I've officially
run out of things to say why don't we go
ahead and put this thing together
and we're off ladies and gentlemen and
we get this show on the road
this thing is nasty is this alright
go comfortable with snipping snip snip
I'm gonna count to three okay
oh one ha all right I'm done being
creepy I guess I'll take the power splay
out next are you gon leave the body of
this chassis power of Christ compels you
let's remove let's remove the
motherboard I really need how do I not
have a flathead screwdriver you know
what I do
flathead screw am I talking about ha ha
too small this is not going to work yet
I need something that's really thin and
long I am a professional and no I'm not
using a ruler to unscrew these screws
how are you talking about make sure you
always have a steel ruler on hand before
you start building your system kids
can't tell you how many times I've been
like damn if only I had a ruler be able
to finish building this computer and out
comes motherboard maybe I can put the
hard drive in there but no I'm not
because I'm gonna need to route some
cables through here see where my finger
is from the power supply they're going
to go through here so I can't have a
three and a half inch here which is why
I need that card reader from edimax I
couldn't just route them here either
because the fricken gtx 980ti is going
to be taking up this whole space
basically cock-blocking all the cables
coming from the power supply routing to
the motherboard
let me take out the hard drive gauge oh
thank god regular Phillips head screws
my hero
ha ha ha
this is audio bean and then you choose
you like me to you indeed to fire right
here movie is desta so it doesn't look
like we can remove the built-in card
reader it is also riveted so I'm going
to do right now guys I'm going to take
this outside give it a quick dust off
and then I'm going to bring it back
inside
we'll continue continue with our build
all right and we're back did some quick
bursts of compressed air just to get all
the dust bunnies out was pretty filthy
oh I need you I honestly do not need
fire wire at all I'm gonna sip that done
oh good
we'll keep the rest for now so we really
decide we don't want and install this
damn case fan it's not going to be great
the ventilation is not meant to have a
fan of the front but it is something and
I'll take it without having to do too
many modifications if they should use a
thinner zip ties the whole thing go oh
it's already in here dude yeah let's do
a chest see we can put this front panel
on it's on yeah that totally worked
prep team elbow prep the mouth bone yeah
mount this puppet
screw this guy down yeah sounds good man
all right actually using the oh no no no
no no no no no no you do not do that you
would not go down you do not do that
anymore you will stay in your socket you
stay in your mounting hole where you
belong
let's go ahead and install this guy look
good that shit right there
first I want to mount the Drina half
inch drive just goes in like that see
that is beautiful that is just tansy
screwing you down boy
just crash out of my foot little screws
and stuff I don't know which ones go
where dinky dinky keen all right so
let's go ahead and try fitting this
inside of the case that a good angle me
just the angle for you guys really quick
maybe I won't even have to cut maybe I
can just do it real time like man yeah
yeah I'm gonna just push all these
cables through a little bit more yeah ha
and her in she said hi hours plan hours
plan one of the easiest parts to install
that was the smash hit single sandstorm
but I do root now I'm going to start
plugging shit in so do I need to change
the camera at all ah yeah maybe a little
bit I'll change the tag for you guys see
you get some tea you like children
they're gonna do everything for you suck
suck suck yeah shit yells look bomb yeah
how do you do it
how do you do Ness all right oh that was
scary
I nicked some of the rubber on the
cables there but none of them reached
any wire so
for good on that end the 24 pin cable
and this power supply wasn't able to
detach to 20 and 4 I probably would have
been able to route it through that
little tiny opening right there so
that's that's that worked out again this
isn't meant to be a pretty build so I've
got these nasty stock cables ketchup and
mustard it's okay we're gonna make it
make it work it ain't meant to be pretty
she ain't a looker and man I think I'm
just gonna put it in slowly
I'm always gentle come on go push push
feel like I'm delivering a baby oh come
on you're almost there you're on me yeah
I feel like I'm delivering and and
having a baby at the same time
delivering my own babies what I'm doing
oh there we go and she's through she's
through it's a it's a pcie cable
congratulations it's so beautiful your
video card must be so proud
all right so here's the system all
finished yeah looks nice
looks real nice yeah this was a pretty
smooth build surprisingly I didn't
really have too many issues I've had
more issues with you know regular
chassis these days then than I did with
with this HP Pavillion case which is
shocking honestly this fan I as you guys
could see I had to do some zip tying
here I wasn't able to screw in any of
the fans
except for that 18 millimeter of course
because I've already had fan mounts but
this one 20 I did swap this out by the
way for a be quiet peer wings - I think
the cooler master fan that I had
initially gone with was a meant for
radiators and it's just kind of an older
design so I wanted this at this fan also
120 but I ended up having to zip-tie
it's because I couldn't screw large
enough holes for for the for the fan
mats so I just want the a zip-tie route
but it seems to work pretty nicely and
there's no vibration noise whatsoever at
least for now so hopefully it stays that
way
and I'm getting a lot of nice fresh
intake for my CPU cooler right there and
you'll notice that the system is a
little bit noisy it's on the noisy side
right now but that's because I haven't
configured any of the fan speeds but I
think the culprit the culprit is
actually the CPU cooler if you listen
quiet pretty silent but then as soon as
that starts spinning back up it gets a
bit noisy again but that's okay it's
four pin PWM header right there so I'm
going to be able to configure that maybe
adjusted to my my my temperatures my low
temps and stuff like that other than
that this is I'm pretty happy with with
how this turned out the power supply was
just a perfect fit getting that hard
drive in there again that was the most
difficult part was just this five-minute
quarter-inch pay but yeah I don't know
what else to say really guys um that you
should stay tuned for part two because
I'm going to be checking out more more
officially the the acoustics of the
system once I've configured all the fans
not just an idle but is lit on at load
as well as well as temperatures I'm
going to be doing some temp testing as
well as just some gaming benchmarks with
this thing because I just I want to be
able to see I want to be able to see
this HP pavilion case just running 4k
like a beast
I think that
be fun so stay tuned for part two
there's gonna be a lot of fun stuff in
there and thank you guys for watching
