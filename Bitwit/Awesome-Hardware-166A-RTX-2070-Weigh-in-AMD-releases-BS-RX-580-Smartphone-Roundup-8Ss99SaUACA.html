thing I needed to do muted forever
it is tweet which I can do because it's
your half of the show so you shouldn't
alright so we were screaming - both now
we should be why hello welcome to
awesome hardware
I just realized every one of our shows
probably just starts with us like mid
conversation yeah and then just an
abrupt hey hey oh thanks for being here
guys this is episode 166 you're watched
inside a which is currently being
streamed twitch TV / awesome hardware as
well as my youtube channel youtube.com
slash bit about and a half hour actually
I almost said an hour that's the old
format new format is in about half an
hour we'll switch over to pulse channel
which is youtoo.com slash pulse hardware
you can also find the link in my video
description this is about an hour long
live show now and we tend to do an
after-party at the end of that which is
streamed to twitch.tv slash house of
hardware as well where we'll do some
some fun stuff today well we will be
doing some pin my PC that's been
reserved for the after we're also gonna
stream the after party to youtube - oh
it's just it won't stay up permanently
that's right that was a lot it would be
unlisted but as you can see I ate myself
maybe after hide our shame with the
after party because that's where the
debauchery happens that's right that's
when things get interesting time to
pregame so that I'd read it I tweeted
time I'm like caught up I'm actually
feeling you know like the last hour has
been like I gotta do this and this and
this and this and all the little things
getting at his jaw now I'm like eh I'm
good I'm reminded of those like I vote I
voted pins or it's just like it's just I
tweeted we should have some I tweeted I
tweeted pictures have that and we'll
wear them every time we tweet for the
show and whoever doesn't tweet for the
show can't wear that pin should make a
phone that we just really healed
dispenses the sticker whenever you tweet
we'll be talking about that exactly on
my half of the show no email just trying
to trying to keep you guys engaged so we
tend to sell stuff we leave we have both
we both have stores which you should buy
things from my store bit wit tech wait
I'm like you do this okay
Tech has an assortment of high-profile
merchandise for the modern geek gray oh
there's a maroon color every now and
then but these are the colors that I
like to wear personally and I'm always I
always subscribe to the idea if I like
it somebody else does too so there's a
bunch of good stuff here in Macon you
should buy one of everything Paul also
has a store Paul's hardware net yes also
same great quality stuff and is your new
design still in the works still in the
works I'm actually I need to follow up
on that and I have nuts okay but there's
still a bunch of great things on Paul
store as well if you happen to buy
anything from either of our stores we
will give you a loud Johnson shout out
which may make you feel accomplished and
uncomfortable at the same time it's a
very hard thing to achieve
makes me feel thank you all in advance
for supporting us in that way you guys
get something really cool in return and
let's see what else does should I say at
the beginning of the show
oh we occasionally swear we'll use adult
language only when deemed necessary by
either of us so if that's an issue for
you if you have little ones around you
have been warned we also like to have
drink or two on the show so the brown
ale yes yes it is some merry old England
good old England I didn't have a single
Newcastle although that's brewed and
bottled by H vbv Amsterdam Holland mmm I
didn't know that and it's imported by
Newcastle importers from White Plains
New York so I don't know what they're
trying to pull with Newcastle Brown Ale
actually it says brewed in Holland on
the front I've had that impression for
right Oh didn't you also think that well
yes no isn't it an English ale but
that's just brewed elsewhere that could
be its an England brown ale a new New
England brand ale listen uh no England
has to be involved somehow
right English yeah yeah the recipe in
Newcastle upon Tyne England and that's
where the name comes from right so
nobody that didn't come from nowhere
yeah but all right so we've learned
something already on today's show
yes and they're clearly not hiding
anything they advertise it that is
brewed in Holland we don't have to
create a conspiracy video around this um
what was the other thing there's another
thing we have additional beer from our
good friend Joe also they had Paul's
editor and compadre we're gonna we're
gonna crack this up are you ready for
this I'm ready okay I'm coming mind you
sly I got this directly so lacquer
directly from the stone brewery
if only you could open it with some high
high quality apparatus mean this Paul's
hardware bottle opener available on
pulsar Burnett boy that's exactly what I
mean Paul we're good at product
placement easy thank you Joe for for
that for that beer Thank You Stone
Opening Ceremony oh jeez I believe based
on Imperial Stout inspired by Mexican
hot chocolate a lien stout brew with
chocolate coffee pasilla peppers vanilla
a cinnamon and nutmeg 8.1% 8.1%
do not do not take this beer lightly
should pour it into this glass okay
let's talk about our first segment here
which is news Peg's news getting ready
to the nitty gritty let's start off with
the with a lot of the hotter topics
today which is the RT x 27 t embargo
just left it for all the reviews yeah
exactly the tone of the game does it
gaming Zed over there oh yes we can show
these asset gaming Zed this is the so
these are both 27 screaming's that's the
gaming okay it's about 27 I'm sorry Paul
I have not seen any 27 TS yet for some
reason my samples did not arrive that's
odd
maybe maybe my what's going on Kyle
someone stole even blacklisted I think
how did you say something to offend
Jensen did Lyle say something to offend
Jensen and they think it was you and
he's actually like is he becoming more
trouble than he's worth like that's
that's that's been my concern yes to all
of those questions perhaps anyway 20 70s
though there's a lot of reviews out I
did a review on the 20 70s all did why
don't we
about that actually okay there is the
mega thread that the Paul has brought up
or that he did have brought up earlier
presses a button they can see it mmm if
you pressed the button
there's the mega thread Paul has also
been added to this list so you can you
guys should check out Paul's video and
the hardware subreddit so the hardware's
have read it and Paul your TL DR
according to to to this reddit post and
seven actually you comment that you
you're actually at the top you're the
top comment on this thread that's a few
sort by best cuz it's the best it is the
best comment irrefutable you said that
the five hundred dollar version the you
found which I would imagine was a kind
of blower style cooler
no that's the two cards at least you
know you get four ninety-nine you still
get a a kind of like more upscale type
of cooler not just enclosed crappy
blower blower fan design he said it was
three percent faster than a
manufacturer's overclocked factory
overclocked e-text and 83% pretty VGA
for the wind to to be specific okay
and the $600 model which was the more
ants up version that you got over there
it's like a six dollar version or gaming
Zed here was 10% faster than that GT X
1080 really any I actually really like
the back pinions
so $600 the six are no over yeah but at
$600
I'm lieutenant get to that EVGA 1080 can
be had for what maybe less than 500 500
ish if you want that specific one you
might have to pay a little bit more but
to get one that's in that can then
either chips in the same clock speed or
can be overclocked to the same clock
speed easily around 500 years yeah 500
is fair to say okay so marginal return
seems like the price performance of the
of your r-tx 2070 s that you tested
against those competitive competing
cards was not wasn't wasn't the greatest
bang for the buck what certainly wasn't
the type of bang for the buck that we've
seen with previous xx
7-0 skews from Nvidia is that fair to
say yeah yeah I mean but the price being
what it is way more sure the value the
amount you get for your dollar goes down
right the 970 in the 1070 those those
were all like the great
for the buck cards when that when they
launched then they've always been the
cards you get excited about sure and
it's like so the room if you look it and
I haven't looked at this recently but
I'm pretty sure it's still the same most
people would build gaming PC's or
spending two to three hundred dollars in
the graphics card I don't know if that's
shifted much over the years that
information might be a few years old but
I think it's still roughly accurate so
that you're talking like your rx5 80s
and your GTX 10 sixties but the next
step up if you can get to it and jump up
from paying about 250 bucks to like 3
350 or 400 like to get to that 1070 was
a really nice jump up in performance and
you could still look at the performance
compared to the price you're paying and
say yeah you're still getting like an
acquittal you know it's not like you're
paying a bunch more for that added
performance so right but now you can't
say that because it's because the 20 70s
cost 500 theoretically in dollars or 600
dollars and that's yeah I mean the the
the cool things I guess if you want to
say that about it are that there was a
fair amount of overclocking Headroom the
power draw on them was pretty reasonable
too there was an actual decent drop off
from the power job like the 2080
did you test it over more efficient did
you test overclock and stock performance
with you I tested the $500 one which and
the $500 cards ship at the base
frequencies abased the basin boost
frequency the Nvidia requires and so all
of the $500 cards will ship at that same
base and boost frequencies that
considered reference reference speeds
yeah and I guess that's kind of
considered your reference or your your
entry level speeds sure so to speak and
then there are there's the founders
Edition which will ship overclocked
which is $600 and then there's
manufacturer overclocked versions that
we will also have which we can assume
are gonna cost maybe 552 I don't know
probably still six hundred and maybe six
hundred and fifty dollars as well until
you start blurring the lines with the
2080
but yeah I mean the thing is for the
cheapest ones for the $500 ones the
question is how well does those will
overclock because they're supposed to be
a different and actual different skew on
the GPU itself and that's what I haven't
done yet is disassemble these cards and
look at that
and it's good my question is can we get
a much people to test their $500 version
of versions of the cards you can verify
if they're like that - a version of the
of the TU 106 right and and - are those
all really bad at overclocking like are
you actually getting a significantly
worse card when you spend that 500 bucks
rather than spending 600 bucks
because overclocks crapoly or something
I don't think that would be the case I
think they'll still overclock just fine
I think they're just doing that in order
to segment the GPUs and so that there is
a actual fixed 500 dollar set of cards
that will sell for that amount that
right that can't be sold for another
amount which if you want to look silver
lining that this at like the high prices
they're charging because I think the
prices are really high and they haven't
made this competitive or an exciting
product but if you have a like silver
lining that could be looked at as
something that they're doing to try to
ensure that there are $500 cards
available in bulk in the market that
people can actually buy this card for
that question can't be answered till
probably tomorrow though tomorrow in the
coming weeks leading up to the holidays
right because that's when we'll be able
to look at stock and look at Newegg and
Amazon and wherever else and say yes
it's in stock I can buy it right now
that's what's gonna make the difference
right now there's a bunch of skepticism
right about that and that skepticism
it's also been pointed it in video
because NVIDIA has this weird
requirement with these benchmarks or
whatever these these initial benchmark
review videos that anyone who's sampled
cards has to be sampled that $500
version so it's like and all of this is
like feels like sort of a weird bit of
coordination they're doing I'd like to -
and and like it's not even like it's
that deceptive because it's like they're
trying to make sure that if I've
dollar card is therefore $500 that ships
at a certain frequency that's
commensurate with its price but the
reason it feels like twisted and like
they're trying to cannot shoehorn this
in there I think it's just because of
what they're doing with the founders
addition and what they started doing
with the founders addition with the ten
series which was creating a founders
addition that's like a higher-end card
they wanted the Nvidia card to be like
the nice expensive one not like the
Nvidia reference designed to be the
basic entry-level one and then all the
third party Adam board manufacturers
make their more special versions yeah
but Nvidia deciding to take that route
and say our cards are going to be like
among the best available that have that
cheap you suddenly like that takes so
much away from the Adam board
manufacturers and it leads and again it
just it it leads to an awkward situation
and a weird pricing thing where they try
to say oh the entry-level price is this
but and then then the cards are
available for that price
right um so we'll see how it turns out
if the upshot I think ultimately is that
you can buy a $500 RTX 2070 and that's
what they want to sell it for and enough
people see that it has a reasonable
amount of value and that's why I think
what a lot of them a lot of the
benchmark reviews have shown today
they've been skeptical because of the
price but they've also shown that yeah
it's it's right up there with the 1080
and you know it theoretically does have
some extra bells and whistles that also
we can't test it and verify but if
you're gonna buy a 1080 for 500 bucks
you might as well get to 20 70 sure if
it's still available and I think I don't
know I guess that's into the story okay
we should probably and potentially with
like driver optimizations in the future
I mean maybe Turing has a bit further to
go has a bit more to grow than then
Pascal at this point whereas Pascal
seemed it seems like it's it's days are
numbered in terms of like driver
optimizations and how much more
performance can be gained with with
future driver updates and and game
development and stuff like that whereas
touring maybe has a bit more potential
in that area but that's great everyone
should go watch Paul's video if you have
the yet now it should be linked you know
I was up till 2 a.m. last night Jesus
you know
worth it you know there's a smidge some
good data mining in there alright moving
on here AMD has listed the Radeon rx
580 on the Chinese market but now it has
less stream processors then that then
than before so what's what's going on
here WC CF tech they've they've reported
that an an tech was the first two who
caught it on AMD China so this could be
right now only in the Chinese market but
it could potentially branch out to the
European market the American market who
knows left wait and see but this newly
announced rx 580 is is its official name
at least in China right now is the arts
582 zero for a SP which stands for 2048
stream processors that's the legitimate
official name of this card first of all
that's terrible marketing because who's
gonna remember that but also it
indicates that this GPU has
significantly fewer stream processors
than the original rx 580 yet it's still
called the RX v AV in fact it has the
exact same number of stream processors
as an RX 570 it should really be called
like that if any pause in our exercises
why don't they because that's not a sexy
paul they won't sell as many units and
people won't think it's as powerful it's
better to you know oversell and
under-deliver is is the mantra that I'm
getting from from this campaign here
still the what this is this is in China
though like this is Chinese market right
now it has not crossed over to any other
market as far as we know but we still
care about our Chinese viewers don't
mean anyone who lives in China yeah cuz
they're billions of people there
we also dual stream to Baidu
no Chinese twitch oh no that's like
Chinese Google oh Jenny yeah that's
right
so again something owned by $0.10 we
probably and our show is probably banned
in China well switch on YouTube are
blocked in China so there you go
so anyway anyway this is something to
beware to be aware of if you're in the
market
for any graphics card right now it still
has the original rx5 80s eight gigs of
gddr5 memory on a 256 bit bus that's all
fine and gravy but calling it an RX 570
is just plain misleading and I I would
be shocked if gamers Nexus didn't
release a video about this if they
haven't already that I had just haven't
noticed because this is very this is
reeks the story reeks of the GT 1030
ddr4 model that that came out sort of
recently that gamers X is also tour tour
a new one into Nvidia over because that
was also very misleading just this is
just natural quickly normal shitty
many times before no I used to play
World of Warcraft on a gtx 260 core 216
which was the special 16 yes but that
was actually and that actually made it
better yeah 216 cuda cores i believe the
original RX gtx 260 had like out of 92
and then opposite with the version that
was a core 216 that gave you a little
bit more but yeah if anyone's wondering
what I'm doing with my hand down here
I'm petting or are yous nervous cuz his
mommy's not home yet so he's Janek had
left against he only owns dogs as a
cover so that when he masturbates on the
stream why is he as a special never
happened it's my only twice and my
knowledge unconsciously one time okay so
yeah I think this is this is like I
don't think false advertising it's
misleading it's very misleading and it
should have been called something else
rx5 70 Plus or rx 575 I don't care what
you name it but not everyone's gonna
know that an Rx 582 0 for 8 SP indicates
that it has fewer stream processors and
is going
replicate rx 570 performance a lot
closer than it will rx 580 I think yeah
it's if you run benchmarks and and and
the data shows that it's closer to a
card that's of a different name it
should be called the name should be
closer to that name it shouldn't be
called named after the card that it's
further away from performance wise
that's just common sense I do want to I
do want to point out like this this is I
agree this is a stupid thing for AMD to
do they're doing something with
rebranding or trying to I don't know if
it's something for that market it would
be interesting for to get some statement
statement directly from them this is
from Linus though he actually posted
this on the Linus tech tips for him
specifically about I just have to say
well because he's talking about if it's
happened before and he said the first
time he got screwed over by AMD and
although it was 80 at the point and at
that point and I think this was when he
was still working with NCIX
and I loosey-goosey guidelines with
respect to the branding of the GPUs was
on a Radeon 9600 this appears to be a
particularly egregious example of this
behavior but this has been
happening for years and likely will
never stop I I am perfectly I agree with
that statement that they're doing it
because it works to some degree and and
no amount of tech youtubers bickering
about it is going to you know halt the
number of sales that they get over these
cards they do it because it works I mean
people complain and they catch wind that
people are complaining and it becomes a
PR issue then it might be something they
take into consideration next time
they're like hey we have a bunch of like
GPU dyes that you know we can't quite
make into into our x5 ATS we what should
we do with them and I go that's deciding
how to name the product like they they
could do it in a way that was a little
less deceptive you know make a special
version of the 570 if it does have
something that makes it a little bit
better than the 570 and then you know
you're getting something better
if you accidentally buy it versus
something worse maybe if
anyone from AMD is watching maybe that's
something they should do but I don't
know if anyone from Manatee watches this
show perfectly alright I hope let's move
on
coolermaster this is an article from
Hex's Coulomb esters launched their
control pad via Kickstarter
ah you had another brand in the PC space
that has taken to crowdsourcing
crowdfunding in order to potentially
fund a a passion project and this is
definitely a passion project what this
is is a analog controller mainly for
your for your left hand or I guess could
be for your right hand but it's got the
WASD there it's a 24 key set it's got
urge B of course but the big point here
is that it's analog so this is great
very this very much is reminiscent of
the the routine one the booting one
which was the first one of the first if
not the first analog mechanical
keyboards on the market so you know most
mechanical keyboards these days are
digital whereas you know when you press
the keyboard down it's a 1 or a 0 it's
on or off there's no gradient it is all
or nothing so to speak and so that can
make it very difficult if you're trying
to play a game and you're looking for
granular control they used I really like
the fact that they use Supercop for this
demo because it perfectly demonstrates
how analog control can be very useful
because as you move about in the game
know the amount of speed that you use in
the game matter how fast you or you know
depending on how fast you move in the
game it determines how much time goes by
and you can move really slow by pressing
the key just a little yeah and so like
if you wanted to move very slow to give
you that sort of edge on a regular
digital you know mechanical keyboard you
would have to just tap it oh you know
they leave left and right and stuff
until you actually got that you know to
get that sort of incremental stepping
but with this little device here you can
just sort of like press the key down
slightly and you know depending on how
far down your travel is that determines
the amount of response in game so it's a
neat little demo that I think proves
very effective why there might be an
interest in a product like this and the
number
are definitely indicative of that this
is already raised over $1000 she said
dick that's a dick I told you there's
gonna be foul language on this show
how'd you kids hide your wife there is
it's already been met it's fifty
thousand dollar goal which is pretty
reasonable I think for a product like
this has already been smashed what last
night checked earlier today was a 56k
that's not too bad so we have 39 days to
go so I could see this either doubling
or even tripling its goal this you know
if all goes smoothly it definitely seems
like this is a product that people are
in demand of currently at fifty six
thousand three hundred ninety one yeah
almost seven her backers forty days ago
there's smooth sailing here so I think
it's a cool little little gadget I
personally don't have time to play games
enough to be like yes I need this in my
life but I could definitely see a bunch
of hardcore gamers you know or gamers
that are more dedicated than I am to the
game be very interested in something
like this I don't have time for your
games either cap oh well see you know
well you weren't so busy making all
these awesome play on words and puns
maybe you would bomb maybe if you just
listen from time to time I'm talking
Jesus Christ
we talked about this later all right
moving on we've got an article from
video cards calm this is in regards to
an RX 590 that was spotted not a mark on
the 3d mark database so sometimes people
run benchmarks on 3d mark and they
forget to disconnect their internet and
so the scores get automatically uploaded
to the database and the chooses for
every everyone to see everyone to see
this just says generic VGA though it
does say generic VGA maybe not not much
is known about the RX 590 right now
there are many rumors and very little
information very little hard to concrete
evidence but right now
many people believe that the rx 590 is
going to feature the polaris
architecture which makes sense
except on the 12 nanometer fabrication
node which would improve the performance
and the power efficiency of over the RX
580 or the RX 4 80 for example but you
could imagine that this is still a long
way off from
thing of the Turing architecture
probably wouldn't compete in that
high-end space maybe with a you know an
Rx 20 60 or something like those me a
Polaris refresh so there's no change to
the 2000 megahertz memory clock and it's
likely still gddr5 based rumors are
estimating that there was going to be
about a 10 performance per for 10
percent performance improvement over the
RX 4 80
compared to the RX 5 90s graphics core
of 47:59 anyone in chat who's saying the
stream is dead the stream is not dead
you're dead stream
you're dead haha although you probably
can't see this if you think yours if
yours never mind this is a message to no
one video cards is factory overclocked
rx 580 power color red devil that they
tested scored 43 hundred and ninety
three points are sorry forty three
hundred and ninety nine points in the
graphics score and forty six hundred and
thirty nine while overclocked whereas
this rx 590 is showing a graphic score
of slightly over that of 47:59 about 10
percent faster
so um rx 590 this could be legit this
could be fake we don't know but rumors
are speculating that in RX 5 85 90 is
imminent so there has been a lot of a
lot of scuttlebutt a lot of scuttlebutt
many scuttlebutt Ella scuttlebutt in the
house uh here whimpering is everything
ok yeah he's just Hiromi let me see if
he needs to go out or something maybe
he's gonna are you you can talk about
them this right I will talk about this
the out of that story because
there's cover here so motherboard
recently released an article that talks
about the Pentagon and how its weapon
systems are very very easily hacked with
basic tools this is actually a
terrifying read as I went about it I
just got more and more paranoid that
something terrible's gonna happen
because of just how incompetent the
Pentagon is at and and how unaware they
are of cyber
cyberattacks a cybersecurity it seems
like a non-issue to them it's like
nothing something that they even think
about and a lot of their weapon systems
are connected to the Internet in same in
many ways one of their one of their like
an f-35 is pilot helmet just the pilot's
helmet just the helmet alone connects to
a complicated data feed from various
outside systems that can be easily act
with very basic methods you don't even
need to be like a good hacker to hack
these guys
I shouldn't be even sharing this with
you guys the the Government
Accountability Office the GAO found
mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities
in nearly all weapon systems that were
under development this is insane
much of the Pentagon's weapon systems
alright I already said that is
connecting the Internet
the GAO reports suggest that pentagon
has done a terrible job of accounting
for these vulnerabilities the Pentagon
didn't even change the default passwords
on multiple weapon systems using
commercial or open source software so
something using they have weapon systems
that you know they got off of github
hypothetically let's end
no no just said open-source that's the
first place by mined way but they didn't
change the default password they're
treating cutting-edge military tech like
a lazy person treats the router let's
just use the default tube is actually
jacked right now oh well that's
YouTube's fault if you can't see the
stream we absolve all responsibility it
says we're still streaming to it yeah
exploit never lies if it says good nope
nothing I'm gonna assume that YouTube is
having a problem restreaming or
rebroadcasting and that it's still
actually yeah I'm the worse still
streaming to YouTube everyone make sure
to click that I add face I believe
everyone has to believe along with us
though that that's actually what's
happening is this dinner scene and hook
yes believe it's the power of positive
thinking Kyle but leave Peter it's
 I tell you so this is
it just gets worse it just gets worse
here
one test report indicated that the test
team was able to guess they were able to
guess and administer an administrator
password in nine seconds like probably
like the name of their dog with the
number one like that was one of the
passwords to like fire nuclear warhead
missiles or something so that's insane
it's been shockingly easy from the GAO
steam to hack into the Pentagon's weapon
systems and take complete control the
lead author of the report
Christine Chaplin or Christina Chaplin
said in one case it took a two-person
test team just one hour to gain initial
access to a weapon system and one day to
gain full control of the system they
were testing another team easily took
control of the operators terminal for an
unspecified weapon system and watched in
real-time as the operators responded to
the hackers disruptions another test
team reported that they caused a popup
message to appear on the user's
terminals instructing them to insert two
quarters to continue operation like it's
a freaking arcade game so they're just
totally trolling they're able to like do
these like little hacks and actually
take full control and completely throw
off the Pentagon systems with very
little effort multiple testings reported
that they were able to copy change or
delete system data including one team
that downloaded 100 gigabytes if you
just like reason just watch a youtube
video on how to hack you can get like a
hundred gigabytes of data from from the
Pentagon right now the GAO has been
warning the the Pentagon about these
backdoors in their weapon systems for
years
dated back to nineteen nineteen ninety
seven but very little action has been
taken on behalf of the Pentagon to fix
these issues Chaplin said the people
look at weapons and they think that
they're automatically very different
than their own home computers or their
business networks and and and they're
not there's there's a lot in common
there's large Venn diagram there's a big
portion the center there she said it she
concluded by saying it looks very grim
unless they see this as a wake-up call
so maybe we should have saved this for
like an ode Joy segment because I
like that fit yeah this is very very
like is there any what can what can we
do to help we we can move all right we
can move to a different country Paul as
always a good solution so there's
there's a happy ending to all that just
leave America immediately war defenders
let's let's move on to a slightly less
roots and goodness less heavy and
daunting story that's which will
conclude tech news for today at least on
my half the Nintendo 64 classic the
console has has leaked some pictures on
the web are they legit what are we doing
now is this a new thing we're trying to
forget about particular and based on the
amounts of competence this is an article
from overclocked 3d net games three
images of the rumored n64 classic have
leaked and it shows the same controller
ports that we've seen on the NES and
SNES classic seems legit so far and a
similar port cover if you scroll down
there might be some more pictures a
similar port cover that we've also seen
on the NES NES classic mini although
that's CC like these are faux these are
fake port ports and it comes out to
actually insert the real controllers
because it's an emulator and stuff but
people are saying that that's coming out
too far it's a lot further that comes
out a lot further in this picture than
the SNES classic so people are
speculating that that's that's why it's
fake it must be fake in that sense
because that's way too flimsy
that's way too flimsy it's a design flaw
and it's too flimsy and fragile to be
legit these must be fake but I tell you
that makes sense that there have been
existing there's there's been several
design flaws or just design quirks with
the the last the existing classic
consoles for example the controller
cables for the SNES and and the NES
classic consoles we're just way too
short way too short and that I feel like
that's something else that if you saw
the picture a leaked image of like a
controller and it was like you know a 3
or 4 foot cable a lot of people would
say well it's got to be fake because
that cables way too short for like
Nintendo wouldn't actually come to
market with with such a design flaw but
no never underestimate the
I don't know poor engineering of
Nintendo I don't know where what what I
can be checked that could be chalked up
to but at any rate we don't know if this
is legit or not that's that's the whole
point one thing is for sure though the
n64 classic if it is gonna come is gonna
require quite a bit more hardware and
processing power than its predecessors
simply because the graphics on n64
titles is just completely different
that's true League it's a completely
different league than those a you know
8-bit or 16-bit two-dimensional games so
how many bits to the Nintendo 64 have 64
I would imagine maybe maybe 63 that's
correct
you know what's coming on that was like
you know tech question pressure the
pressure is on so it's it's definitely
gonna be a challenge to create this
classic console and a lot of people are
saying that this is where it ends for
for the standalone consoles emulators
for the classic series there's no way
that Nintendo could make a GameCube
emulator because it would just be too
because they're cowards because they're
bitches yeah we're calling you I didn't
Tendo because we secretly one and then
we they were real if they were a real
game company they would do it but yeah
they're a bunch of wusses
X Xbox and is you know the PlayStation
the Sony and Microsoft they're gonna
come up with emulators for their ps4
we're we on now ps4 five I'm not a
console pleb Catiline photo cat that's
why I'm asking because I have no idea
yes before I believe okay so it's I just
I just wanna update the viewers at home
who are watching on twitch updating
twitch the strong good live streaming
service which is still working right now
yes
according to xsplit we are still
streaming to YouTube with zero drop
frames sorry the dog some noise
brief moment here okay we're coming back
looking back look at beat later wow they
were really they were very freaked out
about that okay sorry about that guys
ain't your wife Jesus I turn I turn the
volume down to spare your ears from the
barking ducks okay
so be on the lookout for the real n64
classic when when it may surface looking
forward to it that the sponsor spot spot
on spot
thank you very much to Toshiba for
sponsoring this episode of hardware why
it is we have we have some SSDs to talk
about if you will make some amazing with
us SSD very we're professionals this is
the RC 100 it is an MD to take us deep
take a much smaller SSD it's it's a mini
we fill this one off for several times
now it's using their BICS fix I like to
call it fix their big flash NAND flash
which is their own in-house memory which
is you know gets it gets very good very
good speeds maybe not like cream with a
crop top of the line but you're not
paying top-of-the-line price for this
the price of performance is superior to
most drives that you find on the market
and it's it's enough it's more than that
for the vast majority of users unless
you're doing some really heavy you know
you know something that really needs a
crazy reads and writes these are these
are these are plenty what do you have
there Paul
I have the OCZ TR 200 it's a great one -
which is totally not just an empty box
is the SSDs in here you have physical
products here but this is a 2.5 inch SSD
also uses BICS flash memory - over here
they also have an external SSD all those
are links in the video's description
right yeah sure well be they sure will
be very soon so click on those links do
and check out these fine SSD products
from Toshiba yep
and take it to a cheaper for sponsoring
gossip right we love you this one I
think you're gonna take it out of the
box oh I actually wasn't sure if you had
one in there it is it's in here yeah
this is this is tiny so small 22 by 42
22 42 or 42 yeah so much much shorter
than your typical MDOT - it's part of me
like for an 80 gig little SSD thank you
and it's like twelve hundred megabytes
per second reads and 1202 megabytes per
second write something in that range
does broke me at that as we advertise
this product buddy songs but yeah yeah
it's it's over it's over a thousand both
breeds mates okay more than enough I've
got hot and heavy hardware oh good
but not just any hot and heavy hardware
Paul this is the smartphone edition hold
on I can do this because people were
just talking on stop about smartphones
earlier this week they worked and it was
you can't go ignored
maybe ignored what we have to we have to
at least mention some of these
hard-hitting flagships that that were
recently revealed so starting with the
pixel three in the pixel 3 X tau from
Google of course this articles from hot
hardware and that's
it's a good source for hot and heavy
hardware segment you you're damn right
it is that's I was totally thinking
about that when I picked this article
this this is a very long review a very
thorough and good review you should all
read it thoroughly but I am just gonna
do the TLDR here because I did what a
lot of people do and just scroll to the
very last page and basically they're
they're recommending it it got it's hot
and hardware I put it on eternal sir so
this is recommended this is what's going
on with YouTube right now by the way ooh
like it an embedded I believe this would
have been an embedded video yeah yeah
YouTube is taken having some issues
right now cube should know more
very curious what this video turns out
to be because it still says we're
streaming live to YouTube with zero drop
frame something's ridiculous
rest in peace YouTube and twitch master
race I think is a lesson to be learned
here
so the specs what what hot hardware
found about this these phones is the
specs are not the most impressive
compared to their other competitors
flexions it only has four gigs of ram
for example no expandable local storage
and only a 12.2 megapixel camera on the
rear but but the experience the user
experience has been proven to be
fantastic it's got excellent battery
life highly competitive and one of the
best smartphone cameras on the market
bar none I thought just use the camera
from the pixel - that would still be the
one of the best cameras on the market
yeah Bar None that is an amazing camera
it still has the same snapdragon or it
has the same Snapdragon 805 processor
that a lot of other flagships have so I
guess it's equal on that front and it's
got the added benefit of having a clean
Android installations
that'll get updated before virtually
every other smartphone because you are
rocking vanilla Android here people no
no shitty UI the nano overlay what is
that that is an egg I
oh it's a duck okay it's a charging okay
it's got it back like a Qi charger and
you're just seeing ducks with the back
okay so the build quality is top-notch
also has a note it also has a topknot
and the Google pixel 3 if you want to
know prices $7.99 for the non Excel and
$8.99 for the Excel 64 gigs these are
for the 64 gig models this is the price
and Excel has a not just an on exhale
does not I am NOT a fan of the knotch I
will say maybe it's something that I
would get used to if I had a phone with
a knotch
but I personally despise it and I would
much rather have no knotch I don't care
if I get a couple millimeters more space
I just think it looks weird ok
and the any opinions on the neck ah not
to not you're not - not if I had the
option one way or another I would go no
Dutch it's cuz you're smart Paul it is
you've always been smart very smart
thank you with your smartness
so guys fire off in chat notch or no not
CH let's let's blow it up I want to
start a civil war in here moving on
though while you guys debate about that
who way cool way is that annoying
Cranston right qua way hallway my way
Wow mate 20 Pro they're releasing their
mate 20 Pro which is aimed to go after
the big dogs like Samsung Google and
Apple this is article for TechCrunch and
they go to make 20 pro I have no idea
what the hell's going on TechCrunch the
may 20 Pro has difficulty some
impressive specs here a cure in 980
processor 6 gigs of RAM that's more than
the pixel 3 a 6.4 inch curved OLED
screen at 31 20 by 1440 resolution 3
rear cameras 3 rear cameras it's got an
8 megapixel telephoto camera and a 40
mega pixel wide angle and I think a 16
megapixel or a 20 megapixel ultra lens
lens it's got an onscreen fingerprint
sensor with facial recognition you also
get a 4200 milliamp battery with
wireless charger this is a six second
gifts that's looping okay so I was like
wow it sold really was a lot of sense
why they keep showing the camera over
and over
again so I think the coolest thing about
this phone is that
well 3d live object so you can do 3d
live object short that's probably not
very useful but it can wirelessly charge
pairs damn you
so can a bunch of flagships but you can
wirelessly charge other flagship phones
or other phones that support wireless
charging so if we what yeah you can put
your friend's phone on your phone and
charge your friend's phone with your
phone that's a horrible feature why
would you want to waste your battery
charging someone else's battery maybe
your friend has 2% and you have 100%
he's going off on a trip on his own and
you know he's about to leave you and
take his looper right there and he needs
his phone to get him home for some
reason and you you can you can do that
wirelessly by just making your phones
bump uglies and shouldn't be friends
with someone that ears maybe that's why
it's called the mate
you know your phone mates with another
phone and jizzes it some of its juice
into into its partner know that's kind
of romantic yeah turn you around
eventually
so I mean you know another fight there's
another fight that you guys can embark
in on in the chat is this a cool feature
is a gimmicky have you ever have you
ever wished that your phone could charge
another phone so you know some people
carry two phones sometimes they I've
done that before our friend Steve a
Memphis Steve carries two phones they
have two numbers and stuff yeah I'm sure
sometimes he's like man if only this
phone was way more charged in this phone
and there's some way to make them mate
you gotta have safe phone gotta have a
safe oh so there there you go and then
the last phone we're talking about for
hot and heavy hardware is the razor
phone too
not the razor phone T oh oh but the
razor phone too number two this is the
successor to the original razor phone
this is an article from hexxus once
again for some reason this YouTube video
won't play oh wow
how shocking that in cubes not working
right now well will rely on the stills
yes JPEGs for the wind this retains the
the razor phone to retains the
overall look of the original you may not
even notice the difference at first
glance but it makes some refinements
nearly everywhere else which is a good
thing because there were a lot of
problems with the original RAZR phone
they've smoothed out and rounded the
edges so it's a bit more comfortable in
your hand there's also a Razer logo on
the back of the phone that you can see
there that is Razer chroma enabled RGB
sixteen point eight million colors or as
I like to say the eight colors really
interested in this couples back story
like they look really really cool I'm
not interested in the middle don't they
look cool though nope there let me guess
they're there streamers there's twitch
partners because they both have dyed
hair that's how you know if you're a
twitch streamer if some interest you are
that what switch yeah you gotta have
like on with some funky like like
unorthodox colored hair we are streaming
to twitch partners oh that's true that
is that is that is the difference
between us but we could know now because
YouTube is dead so obviously we should
should look into that
since can we be partners YouTube switch
anytime YouTube funny is like there's
still so many people in twitch chat
telling us that YouTube is dead
I know YouTube is we get it guys we
reach it once in a while you know us so
at any rate there's there's a lot going
on here you've got louder and better
speakers it's got Dolby Atmos which i
think is hilarious cuz it's that's not
really it'll be at most you've got a 5.7
inch izg o screen that keeps the 120
Hertz refresh rate that we saw in last
gen model we've got it includes a 24-bit
USB C DAC which is kind of cool
if you're an audiophile or something
like that I'm now displays up to 50%
brighter images than before with the
wider color gamut it's certified for
it's actually officially certified for
Netflix HD are one of the few phones
that that is Gorilla Glass 5 anti
fingerprint coating it's eight point
five millimeters thin Snapdragon 84 v
same same CPU as the at the Google pixel
and it's also got an audrina of 630 GPU
which isn't that crazy but probably
plenty for a phone the vapor chamber
cooling similar
- what they use and their their laptops
to reduce thermal throttling eight gigs
of RAM 64 gigs ufs storage a sim Ana
microSD slot I like the SD slot up to
one terabyte that's nice I do like that
that is awesome
four thousand milliamp light boat or
lithium polymer battery for 10 hours at
120 Hertz refresh rate screen time
improved rear dual camera with 12
megapixels wide-angle lens with optimal
image stabilization
Razer has obviously optimized this phone
for game for games for games they've
worked hand-in-hand they've worked with
game developers on titles like pub Jean
mobile and a bunch of other stuff so
that maybe it'll stand out in the gaming
community as the phone of choice for for
hardcore gamers you can also stream with
the the front-facing camera that's kind
of cool which isn't a megapixel camera
$7.99 comes in mirror black and stained
finishes pre-order today thoughts on the
reason phone Paul any thoughts you're
not supposed to recommend pre-ordering
anything okay you have the option to
pre-order today but you should not click
to myself would you ever consider buying
a phone like this does this appeal to
you in any way
mmm no not particularly Emily because of
the I mean it's it's a gaming phone
alright there's some some aspects of it
like the high refresh rate thing I guess
this is kind of interesting but it's
marketed as a gaming phone I just I
never play games on my phone I drink I
not interested in it yeah if I if I want
to play game I want it to be like some a
monitor or a TV like I just I just don't
like yeah I only play like it plants vs.
zombies and 120 Hertz isn't gonna do
 and a game like that yeah like I
have like a puzzle game that I in in the
most desperate of times when I'm super
bored at an airport and I have nothing
to do British no internet connection
yeah reason that I might play and yeah
ya know I'm kind of with you there but
if you are a hardcore mobile gamer this
this ticks a lot of boxes so and $7.99
it's pretty cheap for Razer for Razer
product it is I don't know when you
consider that the the Google pixel not
even the pixel 3 not even the XL is
$7.99 right yeah
same price as the no I'm sorry yeah yeah
same price as the pixel 3 non XL that's
that's that's a lot cheaper than I
thought it would be
think like thinking razor I would be
like alright $8.99 a thousand bucks but
they what they know that they don't have
a strong foothold in the phone market
yeah they've made too many phones yet
they haven't made too many phones they
don't have that reputation like like
Google or Apple does so of course they
they gotta stay competitive with the
pricing you guys let us know what you
think we'll be sure to not read in chat
let's move on to nothing because that's
the end of my cereal my half yeah yeah
thanks everyone for being here
timestamps stand below that be awesome
love ya and don't go anywhere because
we're about to stream the second half of
this beautiful show on his channel which
can be found on a link in the
description below
maybe you're just the state right yeah
yeah maybe
Kisuke nation like now honestly YouTube
is really really bad right now I don't
even know if what we're streaming right
now is still being picked up by YouTube
just go to twitch so go to twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware if your twitch
haters just deal with it
we'll see if I can go if not we'll just
do an after party on Twitch and wrap
things that'll be that I don't have
anything important to talk about anyways
oh I'm sure the sandal okay
