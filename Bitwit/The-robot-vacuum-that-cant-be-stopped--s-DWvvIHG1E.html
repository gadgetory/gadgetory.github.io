out to me recently and they were like
hey Kyle we'd love for you to check out
our robot vacuum I was like robot deck
Amy's like yeah it's our flagship Xiaomi
s5 and I was like okay I don't know if
we really review those and then wifey
sauce reminded me that I once did a
video on the litter box for cats and
then I went back to Robo rock and I was
like sure why not
so the Xiaomi s5 is a robot vacuum it's
automatic it does everything itself it's
supposed to be sort of a hands-off set
it and forget it type of deal it's a
home appliance first and foremost which
is also why we are shooting at home
today because it makes most sense to
test it out and get the full experience
in the home environment this is also the
first robot vacuum I've ever interacted
with or used in any capacity so
unfortunately I can't compare it to
other robot vacuums on the market so
consider this video a first-timers
perspective on what it's like to use a
robotic vacuum now I believe it does say
in the users manual for this thing that
you should pick up and tidy up your
house before you use it so if there's
like clothes on the floor or you just
got like kids toys lying around you
should pick those things up first you
kind of have to have sort of a
relatively tidy area before it goes to
town otherwise it could get stuck on
things it's just not going to be an
optimal experience so in that sense it
kind of trains you to be cleaner as a
person that being said for this video I
thought it would be kind of fun to say
screw all that why don't we just leave
this place a total wreck and see how the
vacuum performs under pressure I kind of
set up an obstacle course on the second
floor of our two-story house and we've
got a couple wires in different areas
that are in the way a backpack strap
that's just waiting to get choked on
there's a pile of clothes just sitting
in the middle of the floor
I've also simulated some realistic food
spills that I'm sure are not uncommon in
most households and there's also several
other hurdles to overcome here for the
s5 now obviously these little sabotage
points that I've laid out everywhere
might make this area a bit Messier than
the average household or not I've seen
some pretty messy houses but at the end
of the day this vacuum is $600 or close
to $600 now I know that good-quality
vacuums aren't cheap but 600 bucks is
still 600 bucks so I really wanted to
see where its limits are and see what
made up so I feel like this little
obstacle course that they've laid out
will do exactly that when I was ready to
boogie
I simply whipped out my phone and opened
up the me home app because the sucker is
app and able it's actually really cool
it's super easy and quick to pair and
from there there's a bunch of cool
features you can take advantage of which
we'll touch on later but as far as
actually starting a clean up you can
either press the physical button on the
vacuum which is super lame or you can
just have run on your phone and you're
off to the races so with that said let's
see how the vacuum did now remember all
those M&amp;amp;Ms that I casually dropped all
over the place there was about one e of
them I didn't really count but there was
a lot of them and the vacuum picked up
every single one but one there was one
red one that was just kind of wedged in
between the edge of the carpet and our
entertainment center upstairs and it
didn't get that one and I wasn't really
expecting it to but it got every other
one I was super impressed right off the
bat but also kind of realizing that
maybe this isn't a pull-on replacement
for a full-size vacuum and that it's not
gonna get literally everything the
automation technology isn't quite there
yet but let's continue
no wifeís Austinite vacuum pretty
regularly in our house but we have a
very large couch that's relatively heavy
and we don't vacuum underneath that
couch maybe as often as we should and it
didn't even occur to me until I started
seeing the robot do its thing that this
thing can go underneath the couch it can
access certain areas of your house that
a full-size vacuum can't so easily
anyway and it just went under the couch
and it was under there for a good three
five minutes and I thought it was gonna
get stuck I thought maybe I'm gonna have
to fish it out or something like that it
just kept going doing its thing and
about five minutes later it popped out
and it was like hey I'm here your couch
is clean under there it's fine
everything's cool
this also left me pretty impressed while
realizing that this vacuum simply has
certain strengths and advantages that a
full sized vacuum does not once I reach
the legs of our coffee table though I
got a little nervous because it started
to kind of choking and get stuck on one
of the legs but just when I was about to
actually get up and help it out it
managed to get over it and then I
thought maybe it's gonna get stuck later
on it went back and forth over these
legs maybe like six or seven times
during the full cleaning and not one
time did it ever get stuck I was blown
away and then you flip it upside down
and you realize why it got to massive
wheels one on either side with
nice rubber grip and they're just
relatively large to have a lot of
traction and they're big enough to get
over clearly obstacles like these and
then it moved on to the Doritos it
picked up every scrap of Dorito on the
carpet that I could perceptibly see
however it did leave sort of a smear it
did sort of smear some of the cheese
powder rest in peace' cheese powder we
will be missed
wasn't a huge deal to me I had to spend
literally five seconds just manually
wiping it up of course like I said guys
it's not gonna get every little thing
now I did catch the s5 nibbling on some
of those cables and even the backpack
strap that I put down it did look like
he was gonna get stuck at a certain
point but apparently the suction of the
vacuum is just a little too weak for
those larger objects and so after some
gnawing it eventually spit it out and
just kept on trucking
similarly the vacuum thought about
eating one of my shirts that was in the
clothing pile but you know I think it
was just too full off of candy and
Doritos to go any further so it spit out
the shirt and just made a full circle
around the clothes pile didn't get
snagged once from there I went into our
upstairs bathroom which has laminate
floors and we have a couple of rugs in
there the vacuum actually shifted the
first rug around the point where it was
no longer laying flat so it prevented it
from getting a good clean which was kind
of unfortunate but fortunately it did
not get stuck the the vacuum just kept
going to get snagged on on either of
those carpets which our full-size vacuum
does every single time the s5 didn't
clean the laminate floor in our bathroom
as well as I had hoped
it did get most of it but I'd say about
80 80 to 85 percent of it but there were
quite a few hairs left behind and things
like that which is also why total
sidetrack right here but they have a mop
attachment you can pop this in it's got
a water a water port you fill some water
in it and it's got this cleaning cloth
on the bottom it's velcro you can you
can wash it off or whatever
when it gets dirty you can do a wet mop
with this thing it's all included in the
box I didn't test out the mopping
feature at all so I have no idea how it
works you guys can check out other
reviews on that but let's continue with
the vacuum story from the bathroom it
got back onto the carpet no problem and
then went down the hallway to the
stairwell it did not fall down the
stairs and shatter into a million pieces
because it has a built-in cliff sensor
that will detect where certain high
edges are around it and it will prevent
it from actually falling off after
cleaning about 24 square meters of our
designate
upstairs area and 33 minutes later the
device actually guided itself back home
to its dock where it continued charging
I'm pretty sure it still had more than
half of its battery life remaining after
that half hour run but this way it
ensures that the next time we use it
it'll be charged at 100% and ready to
Robo rock apart from the one M&amp;amp;M mini
and the bathroom rug this thing
completely destroyed the obstacle course
that I laid in front of it the fact that
it just did the whole half-hour run
without me ever needing to intervene was
super impressive perhaps the most
satisfying moment of this whole process
though was emptying out the dustbin
which had so much crap in it I mean you
can see the Doritos and you can see the
M&amp;amp;Ms with your eyes but how much else is
it getting what other dirt dander and
debris and sort of pet hair and things
like that is it actually accumulating is
it really doing anything or is just you
know making these fancy straight lines
in your carpet that makes it look clean
actually there's there's it's just
cleaned the crap out of our house there
was so much stuff in there it was
completely full this single dust bin and
I was blown away by how much it had
accumulated in just that half hour
fortunately I don't think we're gonna
have to empty out the dust bin with
every single run because this was the
first run and so it was the dirtiest and
had the most filth to accumulate
especially underneath the couches I
think now that that's been taken care of
the next run won't actually fill up the
bin nearly as much and we won't have to
empty out the bins quite as frequently I
want to circle back to the app though
and talk about some of those cool
features that I mentioned earlier so
when you do an initial run or cleaning
of your house or room or whatever the
vacuum will create a map of your house
and predict it on your phone and from
there you can do some cool things for
starters you can actually mark off
specific cleaning zones so let's say you
drop Cheetos on one area of your floor
you don't want to have to wait for the
vacuum to clean the entire house just to
get that one spot so you can create a
cleaning zone set how many times you
want the vacuum to go over that zone if
it's a really effective area and then
you just click run and the vacuum will
go straight to that cleaning zone do its
business and go straight back to the doc
in a similar fashion you can create
no-go zones on the map which tell the
vacuum where not to go so if you don't
want it to go under your bed or under
the couch or in the kid's room or
ever you can create those no-go zones as
many as you want and prevent your vacuum
from accessing certain parts of your
house to further control your s5 you've
got barrier tape which is kind of like a
no-go zone but instead of an actual area
it's just an invisible wall that you can
draw anywhere in your house and as you'd
expect the vacuum will not go past any
of these walls so if you want to create
more defined boundaries that's a great
tool as well there's some other cool
features within the app as well some of
them are pretty obvious like being able
to set schedules for regular cleanings
and things like that but we won't get
into much more at this point so what are
my overall thoughts on this thing well I
am super impressed with technology way
more than I thought I would be it's
incredibly smart the sensors are amazing
and the fact that it can traverse really
well is super cool the combination of
those things being able to see
everything in my house and also not
getting stuck on anything it is fully
autonomous in that sense even though
it's not a perfect solution the vacuum
mechanism has also proven itself to be
pretty effective so I don't really have
a huge laundry list of complaints with
this product I think the only really big
concern here is the price it makes me
kind of reminisce about the litter box
the $500 self-cleaning litter robot 3
that I reviewed a while back I kind of
feel the same way about these two
products it's this it's they're
expensive it's a lot of money to spend
on a single gadget or whatever you want
to call it but if your lifestyle suits
it and you you value that convenience
that much for whatever reason you're
incredibly busy you just don't have time
you may be disabled or you just can't
then it is incredibly these these
products are incredibly helpful but of
course everyone's gonna value that
convenience differently and we certainly
all have different budgets and minds so
if you're just asking if this is a good
product price aside the answer is yes it
definitely is in my opinion but speaking
of vacuums why not try building a clean
