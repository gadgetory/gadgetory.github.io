thirsty degenerate men I hope so
if you haven't figured it out yet I am
headed to a bachelor party this weekend

it's eight of us guys some of which have
been my closest friends since high
school others so you hardly know so it
should be a nice blend of friends and a
new friend right now web sauce is
actually taking me to one of their homes
so that we can sort of carpool to San
Diego which is two hours south of where
we live it's a beautiful place sunny
beaches and all that crap I am going to
be on my best behavior of course wearing
this guy the whole time I mean I gotta
have to wear this though I mean I
wouldn't take it off if I wanted to
because then as soon as I do the women
just flock to me it's like it's like an
unstoppable magnet as soon as this thing
goes in - hi honey any last words before
I head out and leave you don't be stupid
yes if you have to say that out loud I'm
probably going to be stupid anyway this
is liquor from South Africa product of
South Africa you just got this - total
wine yeah it's great though because it's
like if you want to like go to a game or
something where they're going to check
your selfie right super stealthy you
don't want to drink the street put it in
your coke oh yeah it's a mixer nada is
it is the essence of mixer okay bye
