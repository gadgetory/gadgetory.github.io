channel today we are putting together
yet another PC build of the month this
time around it's gonna be an HT PC or
home theater PC it's gonna be for a
family friend his name is Ron and he is
my mother-in-law's boyfriend he works
for LAPD he's a really solid dude
stand-up guy he'll never give me a
ticket cuz he knows me he actually
confronted me the other day and I could
tell there was some sadness in his eyes
like Ron you look troubled man what's
bothering and he said kow just I don't
know I feel like there's something
missing in my life and I was like HTPC
and he was like yes yes so after I
helped Ron have this epiphany we
immediately started talking about what
kind of parts he might use for an htpc
of his own and what we found was well
it's all back there where let me go
check it out now really quick before we
dive into the parts here I did want to
mention this even though it's fairly
obvious that run is going to be using
this PC for home theater needs such as
Netflix Amazon Hulu you know media
streaming and things like that browsing
YouTube and whatnot he's not going to be
gaming much but more on that in a bit
all right so for starters the case that
we're building in today is the node 202
from fractal design and if you guys
watch the channel often you've probably
seen me do a build or two in this
chassis before first of which was my
dad's PC and the second one was the go
anywhere do anything rig and I think
it's just a really great HTPC chassis
especially because it's got a super slim
profile and it can be oriented either
vertically or horizontally so depending
on how much room or what kind of
configuration you have in your
entertainment center at home it can
really fit pretty much anywhere which is
really nice it also comes included with
an Integra sfx 450 watt power supply
which isn't modular or anything but it's
small form-factor
it is 80 bronze plus certification
certified I should say which is also
nice to see it's got two USB 3.0 ports
at the front which should be very
convenient for a home theater PC and it
does actually have some decent
ventilation for a smaller case and it
does have a full slot for a graphics
card up to like 10 or 11 inches or
something like that so even though runs
I can be doing any gaming if he did want
to do some gaming he could swap out the
video card that I'm giving him for a
more sizable one in the future if he
wants to get his game out for our CPU
we've got the core i5 6500 from Intel
and obviously this is a lock skew so no
overclocking here but Ron's not really a
super hardcore tech enthusiast and he
really has no interest or need to
overclock anyway
so this is a good way to save some cash
while still delivering a decent amount
of performance here on our 1151 skylake
platform we've also got a pretty decent
cooler here actually I've just been told
that it's decent I've never used this
cooler before but I have used a cry or a
cooler the h7 this is the c7 this is the
low profile version and it is supposed
to be pretty damn good for the price
it's on Amazon right now for about 30
bucks and there aren't that many great
options in terms of low profile super
low profile coolers because I think the
limit on the the height clearance for
the no.2 is like 50 something
millimeters but this one is like 47 or
something like that
however this cooler for the price is
known to deliver a decent amount of
thermal dissipation for a chip like the
core i5 6500 there now over here we have
these z170 and Wi-Fi from gigabyte and
as you can tell from the name it does
feature Wi-Fi which is really handy
especially because I don't know exactly
know what kind of setup
Ranas going to have it as home if he's
gonna be able to directly connect it via
ethernet or if he might actually need to
use a wireless connection so it's nice
to have that super convenient for small
form-factor builds also what's the point
of really going z170 if we have a lock
skew processor we might as well save
some change and go with h1 70 it's a bit
cheaper no no supporting for no support
for overclocking but like I said we're
not really going to need it for this
system so that's that's a good option
there also we've got 8 gigs of ram this
is HyperX theory ddr4 of course let me
see what the speed is here the speed
zoom in cow but probably 1866 or
something similar this is only like 34
35 bucks on Amazon so I can't imagine
it's like super fast or anything but
obviously going to get the job done no
problem for storage we have VP NYC s1 3
1 1 SSD 480 gigs now this is the only
drive that's going in wrong system today
and the reason why that is is because
he's also planning on picking up a WD my
cloud and a s or network attached
storage I don't know why I called it na
s that sounds really weird
it's an ass it's an ass yeah so he's
really not going to need too much
internal storage other than this 480 gig
drive which i think is going to be
plenty even if he were to potentially
game in the future as unlikely that
might be he still has some room there as
well on his boot drive so with with that
said we let's move on to the graphics
cards now I did say that Ron is not a
gamer he does not game at all he might
game in the future but I just wanted to
get
situated and make sure that he's got all
the horsepower that he might need for
the future so just future proofing here
we've got two gtx 1080s
the reason why we have two of them
obviously they won't fit in the note 202
is because I simply just want your
guys's opinion of which one I should
give him so there's the EVGA for the win
gtx 1080 and we've got the gaming ex
from msi both of them are eight gigabyte
models so eight gigs of gddr5 ex and I
am totally messing with you because I am
actually going to be putting in this gtx
750ti I would never give Ron a GTX 1080
you guys oh I got you I got you good oh
I would have loved to see the look on
your faces Oh Kyle such a troll such a
troll but yeah I'm totally bullshitting
I'm going with this card this is the
like I said the gtx 750ti this is a
black edition from gigabyte this is
actually the car that I used in my htpc
back in the day maybe a two years ago or
so but it's got it's got it's got some
really decent performance if Ron ever
wanted to do some like light 1080 gaming
you know at high to medium quality
settings I'm pretty sure that this would
handle it no problem so I think it's
going to be it's going to serve him well
for his needs for sure obviously it can
handle like all the HTTP C stuff and
even some gaming in the future as well
but those are all the parts that we will
be using actually not those let me put
these back on my shelf and in case you
guys were curious the total cost of this
build came out to around 650 bucks on
Amazon at the time of filming this video
but that does not include the
complimentary gtx 750ti that i am giving
him out of the kindness of my heart I'm
just such a nice person if you were to
pick one of these up used on eBay it's
probably gonna cost you about a hundred
bucks or so so if you want to factor
that into the build maybe you're looking
at 750 ad in a copy a license of Windows
than maybe an $850 HTPC but again it's
going to be really really super fast and
last him for a long long time so on that
note I can see myself in the reflection
of the monitor which means I clearly did
not plan out this video as well as I
should have
so let's just ignore that for now and
build this computer
you
Oh Roy here's the boot
oh excuse me the cooler it's pretty
quiet you can you can hear it a little
bit but Windows doesn't installed yet
and I haven't tweaked the fan curb or
anything like that but it looks like
it's moving some air can kind of feel to
feel some of the air going through and
you know cable management is always kind
of the bane of small form-factor cases
like this one but I've built in the node
202 enough times to kind of just get a
feel for where the cable should go and
so you can see I've kind of got them
routed in between the power supply and
the motherboard at least our eight pin
EPS and actually I guess 4 pin EPS was
only a 4 pin that CPU connector on the
motherboard and our 24 pin ATX they're
just kind of routed between this canal
here between those components and then
we've got it all tied down right down
there so it's not it's not bouncing
around or anything I was very happy with
how this turned out there's plenty of
room for activities right around here if
Ron wanted to he could install a 120
millimeter intake fan right here or
exhaust who knows and even one below the
video card as well however I don't think
he's going to be putting much of a load
on this thing considering he's not
really gaming at all but in the off
chance that he does decide the game
later down the line he will have that
option to include a bit more airflow the
SSD went in no problem
it's just chilling there right now oh
and I just while I was building I
realized that this motherboard has an m2
slot behind it and I'm pretty sure it's
just a SATA slot but that's still pretty
cool for for being like a little h1 70
board I was pretty surprised to find
that I'm about to slot especially
because if Ron wanted to upgrade his
storage capacity in the future or add
another drive later down the line even
if he doesn't know a damn thing about
computers or building them he can still
install an MDOT to drive relatively easy
without much guidance so that's that's
really convenient for him and I think
that's pretty much it y'all pretty solid
system let me know what you guys think
about this HTPC in the comments below
and toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it this has been the PC build
for the month of August I'm Kyle with
awesomesauce Network thank you guys for
watching subscribe to the channel for
more tech stuff coming at you really
soon and I will see you all in the next
