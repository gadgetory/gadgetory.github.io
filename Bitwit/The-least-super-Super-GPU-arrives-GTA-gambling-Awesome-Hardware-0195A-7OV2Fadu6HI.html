twitch and YouTube at this point so
hello welcome to awesome hardware
hi guys live tech show that Paul and I
do every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time right here on Twitch on TV
/ awesome hardware we also streamed the
show - to our respective YouTube
channels today first half of the show is
on my channel bit weight and in about
half an hour or so will switch over to
pulse you can find a link to his half
when we begin that in my video
description underneath the YouTube
player but let's see we would like to
have a good time on the show it's pretty
laid-back we keep a cache have a couple
drinks on hand usually our glasses are
fuller at this point but we can fix that
ok but that was a lot of clinky that was
raining for the night oh yeah sorry I
got a beware of this but Mike's right
there because people feel like they're
really right here with us
yes very immersive room immersion we
occasionally use an adult language on
the show so be warned and we also sell
things on our merchandise stores which
help us get money and money allows you
to view things so many things so many
things control the bills of others yes
manipulation been torture
bit wait dumb tech is my store you can
buy the screw with confidence shirt
which is still still doing well don't
two flavors bunch of other stuff they're
very high quality merchandise the
glasses are sold out because we are
still in search of a new logo yeah the
days are numbered on this this here logo
for a new one currently side of it I
don't really have any good leads but
we're working we're working tirelessly
to find a new one so don't don't buy
anything with that logo on it just yet
pause or buy things at that logo now
limited time offer and soon like triple
resell value by where the the the
awesome what did your channel used some
sauce I use I wear the awesome sauce
Network shirt yeah that's like an and
people are like man you must have been
be an old-school fan of right Kyle back
before he changed his brands yeah
completely destroying his his YouTube
channel and everything's my channel's
never been no it's actually it's
actually worked a true
point being though you can buy stuff on
my start - yes that's what I was trying
store is Paul's hardware net it was a
great segue fault
yeah um you've also got the the captive
thumb screw yeah there's a still there
on the multitude of items shirts and
hoodies and pint glasses duct and stuff
look how clever that is yes yes it's
great it's great very punny lots of God
woman fantastic aware that thumb screw
shirts are always great sellers as well
I'm happy to pick up either of those
anything from our stores and you will
get a johnston shout out at the end of
the show as always and let's dive into
the news people in chat say that youtube
that you did the wrong start time for
you I did the wrong start time wasn't it
doesn't matter what life did I said they
said YouTube said the one person in chat
sadly they could be trolling I don't
know they could be trolling it's hard to
tell sometimes it's just 5:30 p.m. I
never mind fine
I mean we were only like slightly more
than 10 minutes late which is honest
ease within the margin of the margin
that's the buffer everyone has a buffer
yeah 50 members is roughly 10 to 25
alright so thank you facie two for the
compliment of my shirt my wife bought me
this shirt I was gonna say it's a nice
shirt I dig the Lego thank you yep it's
a mash-up is it oh I didn't I didn't get
it from from the Martian oh oh is that
Matt Damon yeah Matt Damon yeah I didn't
get that at first yeah we'll see you
know it's a mash-up but I didn't realize
this until recently yeah there's a bunch
of websites that sell t-shirts that
haven't you mashup designs on them right
and I was like you know often those are
popular with people because like take
two clever things that people are
nostalgic about put them together right
and people like I want to buy that shirt
it's case in point right here I love the
mashups but then I realized a mashup
changes something and probably protects
them from copyright infringement
which is why when I was looking for
certain shirts because my eye I realized
I have a lot of pulse harbor shirts I
don't have a lot of like non pulse
hardware shirts so you're looking for
just some other shirts right that I
could wear out and about and when I want
to be discreet yeah exactly and I was
looking for just some basic I was like I
would wear a final fantasy shirt that
just had the Final Fantasy logo right
really hard to find that plenty of Final
Fantasy mashup shirts
interests harder to find just the
straight yeah single logo cuz then then
it's a copyright infringement I got to
pay a bunch of licensing fees to
actually make that shirt they lose money
on it that makes a lot of sense was just
think about that anyway brief aside here
to start the show off making you guys
think that's what this show is all about
you do a bit wooden poles Hardware mash
up shirt should we should call them
Hardware shoes and sell them on yeah we
[Laughter]
all right so let's dive in just to some
of today's news starting with the hot
and heavy hardware segment you wear we
talking about hardware that's hot and
heavy sometimes it's it's not sometimes
literally sometimes metaphorically
exactly but it's always one way or
another
um today is sort of I don't know
metaphor I guess it's metaphorically
metaphysical it's I guess it's neither
metaphorically hot or heavy metallurgy
but it is literally heavy ish for what
it is it's the nvidia RG young
metastatic metastatic you know that's
the next word I was thinking of but the
RT X 28 is super who is officially
launched today you probably got 25
notifications normally your sub box some
arrows there's videos from me from Paul
and from well your other favorite tech
tubers so let's talk about it briefly
we're not gonna focus too much on it
because you guys are probably you know
sick of plenty of these super content at
this point in just a super content but
this articles I wanted to highlight an
ant X article because they they do they
always do such a good job they're very
thorough this is this one's by Brian
Smith and basically the long and short
of it is that the 20/80 super is kind of
like the odd it's the it's the oddest
card it's the most it's the it's
somewhat like the least necessary card
out of the super lineup in my opinion
and it's kind of a consequential card
because the 20
the 2016-2017 / only launched as a
report as a retaliation against AMD's RX
5700 series that's the assumption well
that's the assumption but video is never
going to come out and say that of course
not of course not but let's based on RIA
when they launched it and everything
yeah of course total was total response
and and so what happened then was if you
take a look at the 2070 super it
actually increased the performance by
quite a bit you know up to fifteen
percent two times over the existing r-tx
2070 which yeah please do I would like
to I surprised me which brought the
performance a lot closer to its bigger
brother the r-tx 2080 but the Arctic's
2080 at that point was $200 more
expensive than the 2070 Supra so it was
kind of cannibalizing itself in a way
the 20 70s over the r-tx 28 so as a
result of you know nvidia somewhat
shooting themselves in the foot by
retaliating against AMD they had to
create a better stopgap GPU between the
20 70 super and the 20 80 TI that would
was very close that was intentional a
heart attack like reflexes we got some
arrogant bastard arrogant bastard
beautiful perfect perfect beer for the
show but so yeah so the 2080 super it
just exists because it has to it's not a
sexy card it's not exciting but this
Paul's hardware bottle opener certainly
is and you can get it at Paul's hardware
net right now I'll link to the
description so the other thing is that
the 20 oh yeah yeah okay we always get
our priorities straight here on the show
thank you so the 2080 is by no means a
sexy attractive card
I think gamers Nexus put it very well as
Steve said it's phenomenally boring it's
phenomenally boring card it just exists
because it has to otherwise the product
stack invidious products deck would not
make sense so doesn't really compete
with any other cards then like
realigning stuff cuz like exactly the
2080 in its present form with the recent
launches made no sense anymore
exactly
so nowadays but the other thing that you
can see here is that if you if you
really want to get down to it roughly a
five to eight percent performance gain
over the existing r-tx 2080 again
nothing super exciting makes you makes
you realize every since this this launch
came about in this family of cards it
makes you realize how often at least it
makes me realize how often I say the
word super made me realize how stupid of
the like Jupiter my name it is - all
right you could argue about the
stupidity of the name I don't like the
name but it's very much because I had to
sit there and go over benchmark numbers
and specify well the 2080 does this the
2080 super does this and then you have
to go and then I have a twenty eighty
super that's the founders edition at a
twenty eighty super that's from ZOTAC
yes the third-party design and it's just
like trying to like talk about the
benchmark numbers a little bit to just
you know elucidate that for people right
cuz that's people people tend to like
that a little bit yeah it's just so so
confusing
25:27 would have been way better in my
opinion that right yeah because I mean
you got the ti that they've been doing
the ti model for a while and that still
kind of can get a little like I guess
they didn't they knew they had to make
new versions of multiple cards and they
they didn't want to dilute the efficacy
of the TI since the 2080 TI is currently
their halo products yeah yeah that was
the other thing that sort of was
refreshed with me going through the
benchmarks again is man the 2080 TI is a
this is a beast insane yeah it's still
like killer yeah knowing that knowing
Nvidia is just kind of messing around
with the mid-tier cards when they have
the 20 80 TI oh yeah it's just like 20
30 % faster and they're most likely
working on something that's even way
faster than yeah so absolutely it's just
so expensive I know their next card the
next-gen ti is gonna be like $2,000 yeah
I mean not bat an eye if they sold it
for 2 grand
I hope and people would still freaking
buy it I hope you know I hope aimed I
hope Radeon has a 5800 series or a 50
900 series in the works like a
your version of Navi or something like
that even if it's component I feel like
even if it's only competing in the $500
plus range like safe competing with
their current 2070 super in 2080 super
that still might be in a right and three
to one
oops oops sorry that's okay we had a bit
of a little trip trip of a breaker like
like Paulo saying earlier if you got it
like all the electrical you YouTube
doesn't know we were talking about so
yeah all on one breaker if you guys
follow my channel you might know that
last year I had a solar put in and I
have a new main electrical panel and
stuff that was all like the electrical
stuff on the outside of the house so
inside the house everything is still
wired up the same way it was like I
think when the house was built in the
60s which means that the stuff in the
garage the kitchen and the living room
basically the entire this half of the
house is all on the same breaker so all
the computers and lights and stuff we
have out here going on the portable AC
that I have in the garage to keep us
somewhat a livable temperature out here
when it's hot as well as what the ladies
because my wife and my wife or both
hanging out over in the living room my
wife has now turned off the TV which is
probably that should should give us
enough breathing room here to continue
the show so my apologies for that and
and yeah we just we just it's it's
really just a ploy to get you guys to to
miss us every time we just think like
that you know panic I need Paul and Kyle
I just need them in my life you know
what else I forgot to I forget I totally
forgot to announce this but it's our
friend and moderator self Processing's
birthday oh yeah it is his 40th birthday
no less which is a huge milestone so we
just want to say congratulations and
happy birthday cell on making it to 40
you made it you're an awesome guy we
love you we love what
do four for our channel here and and
everything you do for the community so
in honor of cell today any super jets
that are flying around in YouTube all
that is gonna go to him for just a
little birthday gift it's really the
least we could do for all the help he's
giving us completely free of charge
completely voluntarily when his own will
in accord to help the awesome hardware
show so yeah happy birthday we shouldn't
wish him a happy birthday whether it be
in Chapter or I his Twitter at self
processing he's a good dude
for everyone in YouTube chat saying F
and whatever we're it's fine we're
screaming they might be a bit more
behind or something I'm not sure but but
yeah cheers Cheers cheers to you seduce
that bird to sell em play lots of video
games and get super shading they yep
alright that's enough about the r-tx 28
super let's move on to our next article
from overclocked 3d net about Asus
detailing their upcoming XG for 3q
gaming monitor again this is a hot and
heavy hardware segment where we talk
about hardware that's hot and heavy and
this looks like it would be more on the
heavy side Paul if we're speaking
literally it's a 43 inch ass large 4k v
a panel at 120 Hertz with a free sync to
range of 48 to 120 fps nice much cheaper
allegedly than in videos BFG displays
which is probably not saying much
because those things are expensive hell
it does bigger though those are like 65
inch everything's fine nothing to be
concerned about the AC just made a funny
noise like it was that was the condenser
just looking that jeez deactivating it
sounded like it was having a stroke it's
bad I'm not distracting at all okay the
other great thing about this is that it
exceeds the display HDR 600 spec L so it
has a peak brightness of 715 it's which
is quite a bit more than you'll find on
vast majority of gaming panels the
days it also has an anti-glare
compressors greenest not condensers
anti-glare screen and a game fast and
it's game fast input technology from
Asus which aims to minimize input
latency it's got three HDMI 2.0 ports
one DisplayPort 1.4 and it's rocking
10-bit color top the template color
depth with 90% DCI p3 pricing and
availability is to be determined
would you consider gaming on a 43 inch
display Paul if it was something like
this that was targeted and aimed at
gamers uh yeah actually my wife has the
42 the Dell 43 inch oh yeah 4k monitor
it's 60 Hertz but she games on it in
place overwatch mmm-hmm and even though
she's sitting pretty close it like it's
it's really cool so yeah watch your play
so if you were to increase the refresh
rate for in particular I'm sorry right
there yeah the refresh particular sure
that would be pretty nice that's the one
thing I feel like is lacking that
monitor when it comes to gaming in
particular yeah yeah so it's big it's
very large you don't you wouldn't want
to sit too close to it sure but she
plays like overwatch and some other
games on there and then she also does
work stuff on there which includes Excel
spreadsheets so if you can imagine like
a 43 inch 4k displays basically like
having 4 totally 27 inch 1080 displays
yeah alright there so she can do some
crazy Excel work on that and so that's
cool and I feel like gaming on a big
display like that is good like would be
super nice for certain games where like
things are usually pretty tiny like four
so five or something like that like any
of the saved games um I think I think
like this extra real estate in that
sense would be pretty nice to have but
but yeah I actually like I think LG sent
over a sample this is probably last year
of one of their 4k 43 inch monitors I
think it has free sync but same thing as
as years it was like 60 Hertz and I was
like if only it had like a higher
Freight refresh rate that I would turn
it into some sort of gaming you know
device so it's like it's crazy how like
refresh rate determines whether a
monitor like that is gonna be like a
gaming display or like the the secure
like the monitor that I use for my
security cameras at home
that's thanks that's basically what I'm
gonna set it up for is like a new
picture by picture and all that um tell
pulse is pretty nice tab but it's cool
to see that we're getting gaming
displays in all kinds of shapes and
sizes and form factors with the latest
and greatest specs HDR 600 no less
pretty sweet
let's move on to our next article here
this is probably something that no one
asked for but you you might get it
anyway it's the Origin PC Big O two
point O the Big O Big O two point O it
is essentially a single system that
crams together a PC and Xbox one X a ps4
Pro and a Nintendo switch all into a
single Tower these hexxus pictures are
pretty horrible I'm gonna be honest here
yeah I don't know what's up with that
Asaf a super oversee no use pictures of
these is that they're of this setup is
that did they pull these from cuz I
don't know Mon box therapy did a video
on probably at some event where they
okay I had access to it to take pictures
and so there's video right there so oh
yeah so they just pulled images from his
YouTube video oh that's it yeah oh yeah
no wonder it looks like crap well that's
why it looks like crafte he's probably
like one of the few simple in the world
of seen this in person this is probably
the best shot of the interior you have
the guts of a ps4 and an Xbox one 1x
that's what an Xbox one x1 the high Xbox
one X held at high-end Xboxes oh you
guys well yeah we don't and they're
water-cooled
yes and you're just like man stupid Xbox
using green PCBs that's so fast it looks
pretty cool but yeah is this all in the
same loop I don't think so
cuz it looks like you got a oh no it is
it is on the same loop it is right yeah
so the tubing is color the telesco it
I've actually considered this before
doing different colored tubes yet the
color until colouring the tubes so you
can still just have distilled water in
there right and not worry about coolant
or anything like that right but anyway
I'd love to see how they made the the
water blocks fit on
- those PCBs like onto those chips yeah
this kind of custom mounters like that
that's pretty sweet
is the PC on the other side I didn't
even take a close look you see a PC in
there as well the PC specs in case you
guys are curious and interested like
this the msi meg is e 390 god-like so
it's rocking a is e 390 Intel platform
this in 480p core I 999 hundred K there
it is NVIDIA Titan RT X 64 gigs of
Corsair Dominator plats and bitch a
storage thing so beast of a beast of a
mole nicest affair in the PC specs while
showing close-ups of the they make they
make pcs no not videos Paul is there any
shot alright here's the other there it
is there's the beauty side there's the
other side with the PC in it with an
actual nice-looking PCB decent
motherboard that's cool though
yeah this thing's pretty beastly you
know what's cool is also the I think if
you scroll up there might be a picture
of the Nintendo switch go up one yeah
until the switch is removable so you can
still use as a handheld console I've
seen a few pcs like custom pcs that have
integrated like a little switch a little
cubby or whatever yeah that's yeah
that's that's cool too so yeah this is
not gonna be for seldom how you can't
buy it as you can say how much do I got
the there's an Origin PC exact that said
the machines never gonna go on sale this
is simply to celebrate the company's
10-year anniversary which which means
like Microsoft and Sony would never
allow it
what that comes down yeah it's like an
incestuous I don't know it's like
sleeping with the enemy real and so the
Big O two point O is also a throwback to
their 2009 Big O which combined the
gaming PC with an Xbox 360 so this is
building upon that this is definitely a
bit more elaborate and congrats to the
origin PC on 10 years of success that's
a really cool concept like it I kind of
wish they could sell it because I I
guarantee there be a market for this so
totally it be a niche market sure people
who are rich and everything its origin
so they probably charged four grand for
it or more Lisa he's like 10 grand knows
thank you but yeah
but yeah I can say you know if you're
making like if you want to set up like
the ultimate gaming room like bring
people over and impress it right impress
them be like hey right PC console
whatever the hell you want to play on
this yeah you know load some emulators
on the PC side of it you can basically
have access to like write virtually any
game ever that'd be pretty sweet I would
say that this like this is like super
practical if it weren't custom
water-cooled that that's the only thing
is there a little bit of a potential
future problems into the mix because
they're there that doesn't reduce some
maintenance that you wouldn't
necessarily have thought the Shelf
consoles and they're also kind of
terrifying that a leak could potentially
destroy four systems at 100
twitch is pointing out Leon Leon's
is pointing out into which it's got a
Titan RTX Jack's so probably much more
than 4k yeah yeah probably yep probably
closer to 8 to 10 grand maybe I don't
know we'll see whatever if they ever
decide to sell that we'll find out yep
so let's see that's definitely on the
the heavy side of hot and heavy hardware
let's move on to something that's a bit
more on the lighter side
oh but potentially hot at least there
they're hoping that it won't be issues
exactly how they won't even introduce
their premise yeah this is the asus rog
phone - that builds upon guess what the
ROG phone one it's using a new Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 p5 plus SOC at 2.96
gigahertz with a boost GPU clock of six
hundred and seventy-five megahertz
that's on the Adreno 640 it hasn't
improved cooler design this is why I
mentioned heat is because the ROG phone
first-generation was known to thermal
throttle so you weren't actually getting
the full performance of the phone's
capabilities because it was just
overheating and so it had a down clock
everything well this has a brand new
cooler design or at least a new and
improved cooler designed to prevent
thermal throttling like last phone which
should help you maximize the phone's
performance now is that the Aero active
cooler - the little snap-on fan nope
so it is I don't even know I don't even
know if these are the actual official
accessories for this this phone or if
it's for the first
because so far we don't really know what
the accessories will be for the second
phone unfortunately a hideous slide by
the way how does it when the color
choices this some random ingredients on
some of the numbers they've left like
like I said all neon they have screen
caps with like with spellcheck stuff
like that I'd say it looks like the
Grafton a bunch of ecstasy I look at a
lot of graphs and slides and stuff like
that now Shane well made one that's and
that's not when you look at and digest
information this one shit shit this was
absolutely fuck this phone to hell a
little obsessive shit pissed up don't
make a bad graph in front of all you
will not hear the end of it it also has
a larger six and a half inch AMOLED
screen compared to six inches on the
last one oh that still be very impressed
with six inches 23 so she's 780 with 120
Hertz refresh rate versus 90 Hertz so
that's that's better also has 240 Hertz
touch sampling rate which gives the
device ultra low touch legacy I'm so
like out of tune when it comes to the
mobile world I'm like touch links what
is what a touch latency is that like to
tell you their site again the right
thing you can touch the phone and how
responsive the touching is that it's its
input lag is basically what they're
talking about of your yeah the time it
takes your finger to actually register
yes an input I see exactly make sense so
49 milliseconds versus 87 milliseconds
on the their main competitor which is
the Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus so that's
about a 40% increase and if you're a
serious mobile gamer if there is such a
thing as a competitive mobile gamer of
course there's there has to be and then
this is probably a very important spec
to you it's also going from 8 to 12 gigs
of ram you have a 4k or you're going
from a four thousand to a six thousand
milliamp battery i think this is
probably one of the biggest improvements
gaming on a mobile device
drains a lot of power very quickly hey
cells I'm Chad happy birthday so happy
birthday Sal
smells badass also why I'm distracting
you crafty hack is also moderating yes
thank you how much crafty for being here
he's moderated a few times recently he's
excellent very doing a very passable job
yeah so your job is and I would go so
far as to call it adequate
I'm just getting crafty you're awesome
thank you for your help yeah wildly
nearly sufficient so we also have a 3.5
millimeter jack yeah you know hardcore
gamers and I like that gonna be happy
with that 512 gig storage main camera is
going from 12 megapixels to 48
megapixels which is a huge bump over the
last generation and again there's
probably gonna be new accessories for
this phone just like there was for the
last phone however no cross
compatibility with existing accessories
from the last gen or a G phone because
of the size difference of said phones
yes that makes sense a lot of them like
snapped around the housing and stuff so
yeah a very tailor-made that makes sense
easy
yeah crafty crafty said nearly
sufficient have you been talking to my
wife let me keep you around it's gonna
release in China or I guess it really is
in China today and it'll release
globally in September price is unknown
expect to pay a pretty penny all right
that is hot and heavy hardware whoo you
move on to my next segment which is the
gamers report Games report there wasn't
a ton of tech news today apart from the
RT X 2080 rubbish so good so I'm gonna
talk about some games okay starting with
this article from PC gamer although
everyone's talking about it right now
GTA 5 is still lower thirds Kyle oh
Jesus all right sorry it's updated work
I think we're good clear hmm GTA online
is still relevant apparently they keep
rolling out DLC the next big thing here
is Thank You Diamond Casino I constantly
like people like twitch streamers yeah
play GTA all the time it's constantly in
the top yeah range it's still hot man
it's just one of those games that people
live so Sandboxie and people do so many
things yeah that and the graphics are
just amazing like fer sandbox and it has
by far the greatest graphics and all the
mod like the mod community for it
obviously you can can't really get too
far online with that but very dedicated
mod community there so this is the
diamond casino have you heard about this
fall you should bring all of your money
to the diamond casino ok spend all of it
as fast as you can because there are
things you can do here that you you've
otherwise never been able to do in the
game you can play poker
you can play blackjack you can play
roulette you could even bet on fucking
horses Wow ok and to play all you need
to do is exchange your cash for chips at
the cashier services just like a real
casino ok it's a it's really it's the
future $500 of in-game currency gets you
casino membership which Awards you a
one-time $5,000 bonus and it also gets
you special privileges I think there's
like a limo service or some other shit
that you get in the game it's it's very
boozy you can get buried boozed out with
this new downloadable content apparently
one chip is equal to 1 in game dollar
which kind of makes it confusing as to
why you would need to cash in dollars
for chips but there it is the chips are
just funner I guess you can only buy
50,000 chips at a time before a cooldown
timer starts if you if you're a high
roller like that and can actually afford
$50,000 a second new currency but
they've gated it so that there's certain
stuff that would require you to like go
back to the casino multiple times and
max out that number in order to purchase
it with casino chips I am Not sure I'm
not what I wouldn't be surprised there
are lovely items that you can buy in the
casino once you score big once you win
big and can you buy the casino can you
only see that's probably a future DLC
you know buy buy a piece of Los Santos
like a property management property
owning this is why GTA san andreas is
still the still the because you could
buy casino best what did you could buy
proper Walt I mean yeah part of the
endgame las pinturas
get a casino I don't know it's been a
while since it's the San Andreas is the
one installment I'm
ever played really and I know it was
like one of the best it's really good I
know I know
it's I played quite quite good I played
three I played four I played by city
I played five literally san andreas was
the only one I don't know it was a weird
time I was or I don't know I don't know
gotta step into CJ's shoes man I'm
working on the corner at the San Andreas
working on the corner of our TV you
don't do that in San Andreas as well
okay well um you know this is better
though because you can actually have a
baller suite all right you can actually
have a baller suite with multiple
bedrooms a spa media rooms a home
theater there's all kinds of shit you
can do in here okay all you need to do
is spend real money on fake bullshit
in-game currency and you could be a
complete fictional god all right and all
the fictional ladies will flock to you
and yeah that's pretty much it oh you
can customize your mansion Oh
unknown mater which is a user found that
it will cost you a mere sixty three
million dollars Indian currency if you
wanted to buy absolutely everything that
the new DLC has to offer it's good to
know I don't know how much that isn't
real I wonder I wonder how many people
are sitting on that much money in GTA
online cuz I know that I've like I
rarely get to play mm-hmm but then
whenever I play there's people who like
clearly have lots of time to play we're
we're good for now
oh I'll probably take one okay just in
case well we'll get it back up
sure yeah that's for me that looks
delicious thank you yeah yeah yeah we
have personal servants that pandas beer
throughout the show it's just that's
just how it's normally goes part of the
YouTube contract oh yeah right
once you get to our level like this is
just what you can expect for your a
million subscribers just thank you
number 75
at 75 it's yeah were you looking for a
bottle opener yes I was I have this post
hardware unfortunately this level of
YouTube fame does not come with a bottle
of bottle service doesn't that's to get
up to 5 million subscribers that's -
about that ok I frequently ask him how
the bottle service is sure to go atomic
Oh says he has over 300 million dollars
in GTA so ah damn that's good
well I guess he's you should go and buy
everything from the casino Jesus Louise
what else were you accumulating all that
cash for you obviously were waiting for
this particular thing uh all right isn't
it wait hold on isn't there kind of an
issue here if you're like able to gamble
with Indian currency but you're using
real money to buy the in-game currency
is there no like is there no controversy
here look like you know you're gambling
with games in like they're potentially
minor is playing like what the whole
csgo skins thing you're gambling on
skins is this I mean you can literally
play roulette so if I I don't know the
details here so I'm just taking a shot
in the dark here sure but I think the
difference would be that you can't cash
out the money it's a one-way transaction
you can buy in-game money but you can't
necessarily take that money and then
like cash it out for a $50 game card or
something like that I say that makes
sense and there's no way to transfer
money to somebody else in-game is there
hey can you transfer it can you transfer
money to like in-game currency to
another player but even if you could
that would still like no one like once
you've spent the money in game you can't
profit from it outside of the game like
you can't you can't pull that money back
out I think is the thing it's a one-way
thing you're giving Rockstar money yeah
rockstars never giving you that money
back well no no I understand that but
I'm just saying let's say you you win
in-game currency back there's probably
somebody out there if you can transfer
money in between players who would pay
real money for your in-game currency at
a at a discounted rate that you would
undercut Rockstar and I think in that
case it would probably be like a gray
market thing
not approved so right right that
wouldn't be within there that would they
don't have to be responsible for that
again okay I'm not familiar with the
details of this I could totally be wrong
I'm just kind of this is this is the
logic that occurs to me as far as far as
this goes I don't make sense okay okay
all right that's that's all for that
article let's move on to our next topic
which is from Rock Paper Shotgun I
really quickly here Wolfenstein
Youngblood is slated to release one day
early on PC it's nice when the the PC
gamers of the world gets a little bit of
special treatment does it what a huge
big boon the home be to them whole days
it's a big deal for some people but it's
gonna be releasing on July 25th that's
just in two days here on the PC it's
gonna be July 26th for everyone else oh
you dirty Normie plebs you have to wait
a whole 24 hours to play this this new
installment of the the Wolfenstein
series this is a video from Rock Paper
Shotgun which is linked in the article
Youngblood launches on Steam for a $30
u.s. I'm surprised it's only 30 bucks is
it not just a is it not like a full
fledge triple-a title maybe they just
wanted to charge a reasonable amount for
the game so people play kau attentively
Paul there is also a word that there's
not going to be any rate racing at
launch it may come later but we're not
sure how it'll be utilized in game so
okay yeah you will not be able to see
the glorious reflections off of all
these Nazis all the robot Nazis at least
for now at least a day one however let's
let's pick this back up though there
there is some potentially good news here
because the game control does have rate
racing at launch our article from
overclock breda net says that the game
will include ray-traced reflections
contact shadows and indirect diffuse
lighting and they're really advertising
this wonder how and how much NVIDIA paid
them to advertise rate racing in their
games so heavily but there's trailers
and there's been a trailer or two as
well as these kind of like swipe swipe
left
right RTX on and off screen shots that
they provided so here's just a nice
little trailer but you can see how
ray-tracing effects the visual look of
this game I was startled there it
suddenly stopped and I was startled oh
no it's not it's not too scared here
okay so alright yep looks look slightly
better there there are definitely some
areas like that looks pretty cool you
know you can see the reflection in the
mirror there are some scenes that yes so
it's more impactful than others so
here's a good example of ray-tracing
having an effect in-game and this I
talked to in video a little bit about
this and I was like it was reminded me
of physics beckylyn physics first came
out by ogia back before Nvidia but the
physics IP I was like there's no game
that requires you to have ray tracing in
order to experience the game properly
that you need ray tracing for right that
is a really good game that everyone
wants to play yeah and there's a there's
a chicken and the egg thing going on
there because no one's gonna develop
that game because there's not enough
people who have r-tx cards to enjoy it
but anyway all that said you could see
this type of thing being used in games
with some effect so like this is people
who are like who like talking shit on
ray tracing like don't talk shit I'm ray
tracing know you can talk shit on
invidious choices over the past year
when their push for ray tracing and I
feel like they sort of overhyped it and
then there wasn't enough substance there
so people got kind of turned off by a
bit yeah but the technology isn't to
blatantly you can see a bunch more
there's more to be derived here due to
the I know this is just reflections of a
thing here but you can sort of see how
this could be used in a game of course I
mean provide further immersion or - yeah
you know imagine a horror game where
you're walking through a haunted house
or something and you can see like a
ghost or a monster behind you in a
reflection of a mirror and like a broken
mirror near like you can see like
perfectly ray chased by you and you can
turn around ahead and it's not a
simulated viewport it's an actual
reflection or something that's happening
down the hallway that you wouldn't see
otherwise if you weren't facing it
exactly the right thing okay anyway so
brief aside this so everyone should go
by control and by ray tracing supported
our t-rex cart
and there you go thanks a video thanks
thanks for fitting thanks for paying
this to say all that
of course let's move on to our last
article here for games report about the
Nintendo switch okay
the Nintendo switch is getting a new
console coming in August that's supposed
to have double the battery life which is
huge as a lot of switch users are using
these consoles on the go as they're
intended to be used so this is gonna
cost the same $300 at the original
console cost right now unsure if the
existing console is gonna see a price
drop or anything but there is a slight
issue it might be hard to tell apart the
first and second gen switches if you're
looking at these in a brick-and-mortar
store for example now it does look like
the packaging is slightly different you
can see here we've got the og Nintendo
switch on the top and the Refresh at the
bottom the retail boxes are slightly
different so I guess you could tell that
but to the untrained eye you know your
mom or dad who's looking for a new
switch for Jimmy for Christmas isn't
gonna know fuck-all they're gonna be
like oh it's the same shit they just got
fancy with their their packaging it's a
pretty significant difference though
yeah
two and a half two or the range was up
to six and a half hour is now up to nine
hours potentially even more depending on
how you use it
but there are other ways that you can
tell the switches apart apart from the
retail packaging the model number for
the original is H AC double O one
whereas the model number for the new
switch is H AC double O one - oh one so
there's a little bit of an extra just a
few stupid why isn't double O 2 oh yeah
like yeah I don't did you not have
enough digits here Nintendo it has 0 0 1
how many versions of switch do you have
that you could have made that 0 0 2 or 0
5 3 or any of the literally 999
different variants yet you had to add
another - 0 1 in parentheses on the end
why the friggin hell do people sorry
digit quota they're like alright we must
have 5 digits in this one
for no apparent reason Stu me no it
definitely doesn't we should have a rant
segment where we talk about shit like
this now there's also the product serial
number beginning with XA W on the
original switch chat is Right 998
different options Wow one was already
used versus xkw on the new one and then
you can look at the probe a turi life
description where it goes up to 6 and a
half hours for the original and up to 9
hours for the new switch so there you go
now you will never be confused because
you decided to tune in to awesome
hardware that one time there's also the
just worth mentioning the the switch
light the switch lights is gonna be a
new console that's only it's like
exactly like a switch but it's only
handheld there's no dock so it's not
intended to be hooked up to your TV it's
simply an on-the-go device that is kind
of like a beefed up 3ds in the way
support people twitch it's a poor people
switch switch not switch and poor people
so I was like poor people with but
that's gonna cost $200 so it's gonna be
a bit cheaper because there's not as
much fun not as much functionality but
there are a lot of gamers out there who
are only using their their switches in
in mobile cases and let me let me
clarify here cuz I said like I don't
understand why they did this ok I do
understand why they did this I know
exactly why they did this it was
intentional
it obviously obfuscates it requires a
special article to the to determine the
difference between these many of you
hopefully many of you who were
considering
a switch purchase now know this
information whereas you otherwise
wouldn't have nintendo wants us they do
this because there's a bunch of the old
version out there and they don't want
that stock to suddenly become invited
like not valuable not as valuable or to
suddenly sell for less right because
people only want the new one sure so
they create confusion between the new
one and the old one yeah so people have
a difficult time discerning between the
two and that way they can still sell the
old one even though the new one has come
out right that's exactly what Nintendo
did this yeah that's a good point zip it
is a it is shitty that totally makes it
shit only make sense and I don't like it
yeah okay I don't know what what's the
alternative
they just phased this they should have
just sold out the alternative is I'm
coming out with a new version that's
that that is just that is something that
is more distinctly different from the
old version and then they have to cut
the price on the old one yeah they're
still trying to sell the new one in the
old one for the same price they're still
trying to sell both return or bucks I
think that I need to take the old one
and sell it for 250 or 200 bucks to
clear out the old inventory but they
don't want to do that they want to make
the same profit margin that they did
before yeah so they do something like
this this is why they did it yeah that's
Business Corporations Jamie yay groovy
smashing okay and then finally let's
move on to our last segment which is
just a really quick
stupid makeshift segment that I just
made up in the last five seconds ask the
audience no it's not Oh kind of yeah it
is we only have one question and it's
not tech related at all so as some of
you guys know wifey sauce and I are
currently renovating our living room
it's a huge huge project that's gonna
take six to eight weeks to complete
we're currently in the midst of it and
we just found out a few days ago that
the contractor said that that the area
of the house that we're trying to pour
concrete in because this is the house
right this is the house and there's the
living room that we're trying to
renovate but the living room that we're
trying to renovate is weird because it
actually goes down a step so if it goes
down a step and then it go and then
later on it goes up a step have you done
any vlogs recently no no not yet you you
won't really find it there oh you just
posted a picture I posted some pictures
or whatever but basically we have this
goes down what's that oh they're perfect
perfect community tab beautiful okay so
you see the step right there so this is
the living room this is the current
state actually this is it looks even
more disheveled than this right here
since this was posted so you see the
step there on the right this one right
yes so that needs to be flush with the
rest of the house and in order to do
that we need to pour concrete all up in
that that empty that that sloped that
lower area the lower part of the
foundation okay like underneath where
this would be like basically all
here needs to need to be filled with
concrete this doesn't have concrete on
it right now
no we need to make it flush we need to
make it flush weak we want to look I
gonna raise the floor on the left
exactly we want to raise the 40 minute
wash okay however the rest of the house
is one inch shorter than where that step
is up here yes okay so technically we
would actually have to have a one inch
one to one and a half inch step right
right but right between the dining room
and the living room there's a little
there's like sort of a wide like a
really wide doorway that frames the
house and then there's this other room
and when you come out of the main house
it goes down yes and then this is that
room and then it goes up at the end of
that room and then there's the upper
levels yeah we're talking about filling
in this lower level here to make it
flush but then that would make that a
little bit higher than the level of the
house exactly 1.5 inches 1.5 inches
roughly a little soap up so the question
that I had and that wifey sawsan I've
been wrestling with is is this going to
be a problem is it going to be annoying
we've never had or lived in a house that
had a small step like this that's just
like an inch and a half you know if it
was one step like a one regular-sized
step like the one in that picture I
think it would be less of an issue
because it's very visible people won't
likely trip on it and I think that's our
main concern is where's the bottle
opener hey I think didn't steal it
she took it hey no sorry never mind
never mind never mind go away that was
accusing you of wrongdoing it's usually
right about that so is it gonna be an
issue to have a step that's one and a
half inches I I don't know how will it
look and how will people interact with
it well will they trip on it will it not
be an issue we could do a slope but that
would look after crafts you put a
comment
Oh from graphene not if you install a
camera to capture everyone tripping over
it I thought of that I thought how
hilarious would that be if we just
benefited from everyone else's sorrow
and pain but wifey sauce didn't really
like that
plus I'd probably be one of the people
tripping on it so yeah
any thoughts on on this Paul would you
would you a little step would you put
like a that that tape like the yellow
slash reflective tape you know they put
on steps like high visibility to warn
people I don't know if that would match
our floors maybe might stand out a
little bit might be a with your another
sighting modern or so these are the
important questions that we have been
trying to answer the questions like this
have filled our life for the last two
weeks and it's they're important they
are important because this is what
you're gonna have to deal with it and
make the right decision or live with
care earlier for like years and years
afterward it seems like such a stupid
insignificant spend thousands of dollars
they fix it right but you mind puttin
that over there with you
so we're racking our brains about this I
think wifey sauce is biggest concern is
that it's gonna look ugly and that
people will trip on it and I somewhat am
concerned about that as well fair enough
although it might not be it might be a
non-issue maybe everyone who comes in
will obviously see that there's a step
there and not trip on it at all and
it'll just look like a little step and
it will people won't be like oh god the
step oh the house is beautiful but the
step just we ruins everything we watch a
decent amount of house hunters yeah it's
it's my wife's decision but I'll be
honest I don't I don't object or
anything to it people seem to constantly
complain about stairs any times their
stairs like alright the kids are gonna
fall down the stairs and died or
something like that
like how many wouldn't people like
stunts like you're in your situation
when people stub their toe once and
realize there's a step there yeah for
sure yeah exactly like don't children
need to learn how to negotiate stairs at
some point in my life into like look
before they leap type of thing something
like that so right so it could easily be
a non-issue I'm really curious to hear
you know from people who actually have a
step like this in their house cuz your
contractor it's not as uncommon as we
think maybe it's just hell people are
gonna the foundation like especially of
a slab is the worst decision
we've ever made to go with that step
destroyed our lives sorry alright let's
give the results and then we can end my
half okay so I've been rambling on let's
check it all to eat yes people will trip
and die and you're gonna go to jail
today so 2/3 roughly 2/3 of you think
that it's a terrible idea the problem is
we don't have a great alternative we
could do a slope like a gradual incline
but that I think is gonna be a uglier
what if you just burn down that room
just burn it down well we've already
forget about it I wish that was an
option now after we've already dumped so
much money and hits ash in your backyard
like we never speak at that place so and
then you and then here's anyone who
comes over you like tell them you like
so many there would have been so much
grief and horror of people with stubbed
toes had we not burned down that room
our backyard would have been a graveyard
I'm just saying listen that's an option
you have all right well I'm still but
that's gonna do it for my half hey thank
you so much for watching don't go
anywhere though because we're about to
stream for another half an hour or so on
Paul's half and there's an after party
and there's an after party although it
can't be too long because we do have
your crunch on for dinner
but yeah don't go anywhere we'll be
right back okay where you are on Twitch
