to you by fractal design MSI and cable
model check out the links in the
description below or all your money will
turn into dogecoin we're at the
aggressive fan text booth now and this
is just massive buck Paul can you stand
in the frame so I can see yeah they can
see how big this box is Paul Paul for
scale yep that'sthat's a shipping box if
you buy this certain product from fantex
it will arrive in that thing let's go
ahead and check out to see what exactly
it's supposed to fit in there and to
elite holy smokes it's finally ready
it's finally ready guys this has been
like two years in the making and this is
the final version that you can see
actually it's available now according to
context for the low low price of 899
holy crap I'm actually serious about
that price point but when you actually
take a look at all the features that
this thing comes with you can kind of
see that this is pretty much a premium
case through and through that's been
again two years in the making and it
really shows here first off you just get
a really nice aesthetic super clean
typical fantex
you get a really nice tempered glass
side panel as well the great thing about
it is that it actually swings open
there's no screws that are on each
corner a little some screws or anything
like that
Paul can so eloquently demonstrate that
right now look at this like a clear this
guy look at this guy look at that boom
but there you go you can also remove
that side panel if you wanted to just
lips off off those hinges here's a look
inside keep forgetting there's like an
entire lower compartment here with it's
a massive radiator look at that
reservoir that reservoirs just
ridiculous and actually there's a
removable panel that that reservoir is
connected I'm sorry reservoir the
radiator is connected to and you can
just take that out and then do all of
your mounting that way stick it back in
and that way you can actually build this
entire PC without ever having to move
the chassis on its side in fact that's
how fantex built this system they just
told me that they didn't even have to
move it around it was just pretty much
in one spot it does weigh like 70ish
pounds so I guess you wouldn't want to
have to move it around too much so
that's why they've designed it the way
they have if you take a look over here
behind the reservoir well first off the
reservoir is kind of on this mounting
bracket here but that does pretty much
pretty much mounted to the back wall
there the back wall serves several
purposes apart for a mounting year your
pump presses are
reservoirs things like that you can also
mount radiators up to 360 millimeters or
you can if you're not using the space at
all they have these nice clean brackets
you can kind of see in the background
there to cover up all of the is the bare
metal on those also has 2.5 inch SSD
mounts on them so you can show up your
SSDs that way but you can also see
there's just no shortage of LEDs here
this is RGB of course pretty much
anything that you would want to think of
you can pretty much do it does have full
control on the front which we're going
to get to in a sec but right now they
actually have everything hooked up to
the msi mystic light app so everything
is connected and can be in sync you can
also control things independently if you
wanted to I believe and pretty much just
just no shortage of possibilities here
in terms of aesthetics there's also a
just tons of radio support all over the
place
you've got 480 or a 420 at the top and
then at the front there is a 405 60
which is a quad 140 don't see that too
much but on the case of this size and
caliber that's pretty badass you can
also have several radiator options on
the compartment panel right here
speaking of which if you wanted to you
could actually take out the aluminum
panel that's right here and swap out a
separate panel that comes included with
the case in that a mini ITX system in
here just just goes on the features
never end here so if you want to do a
dual system here maybe have one for
gaming one for streaming
thank you again Paul your hands are very
useful today okay that I do I do you
know me so well
and then you know the i/o would go out
the back things like that very fancy
stuff here let's go ahead and move
around to the front panel boom let's
take a look at that now you're just one
seven I love you and I don't got it I
love you this is why you're here well
you stuck your fire thank you
alright so here's the print 'hail we've
got two pairs of USB 3 ports is actually
one pair for each system so the main
system and then the mini ITX one and
you've also got the V already HDMI front
panel which is great for HMDs for your
VR headsets USB 3.1 gen2 type-c on the
front this is going to be great for all
those z2 70 motherboards down of just
release that have a front panel USB 3.1
headers on the audio and like microphone
jacks and of course power
and reset buttons over there to the
right and you've also got built-in LED
control the full spectrum of different
effects and in color tuning if you
didn't want to use the something like
the msi mystic light app if you take a
look at the top here on this is actually
kind of an open shroud design for
therefore the top panel however if you
wanted to tailor the system for silence
you could easily swap that panel out
with an included panel that is pretty
much enclosed for the most part just to
get a more acoustically beautiful sound
profile with your chassis and if we move
around to the side here this is the
backside looks pretty normal like no no
nothing no frills here but actually if
you take a closer look there's there's
this little cutout area which you can
actually remove the panel which would
open up air flow and ventilation for the
radiator that you would potentially
mount on that bracket we just mentioned
earlier and if you do do that they've
also included magnetic dust filter you
can slap on their fan tax is also you
know just just so you know if in case
you haven't found out yet they make
everything super intuitive so even the
side panel on the backside is super easy
to remove there's no thumb screws or
maybe there's a thumb screw in the back
yeah there's there's two thumb screws in
the back they are they are captive but
they but they also have made it so that
you can just latch on the side panel
with with couple latches just clips in
there it's apart from the capacitive
captive thumb screws it's fairly tool
listen really easy to mount on and
here's a look at the back you can see
that they've got some flexible mounting
strips there for the rear fan plenty of
expansion slots for your video cards and
if you want to you can even mount your
GPUs vertically as you see right in here
you actually have the option to do it
either vertically or horizontally under
giving you like an extra bracket for all
of that Paul's Paul's hands are failing
me right now as I was hoping that you
would pump out you know bring out the
yes a text version of this case is
absolutely ludicrous it's the most mad
thing I've ever seen so it's actually a
copy text I believe is that where I've
seen you before yeah and I did a video
on this a copy text and edgy I'm still
blown away every time I see it it's just
absolutely ridiculous I don't know if
you guys noticed this also but there's
like all the water walks in here all the
water blocking here are fantasy so that
they sell water cooling products here
on everything from the GPU and the CPU
block and they also have integrated RGB
LEDs which actually you can actually
sync all those up to a single splitter
and all the other LEDs that are in this
case you can just wire that to that
splitter and have one Universal
connection going to your power supply
and that way you can sync every single
light that's in that system with this
you have this app right here or if you
wanted to you could also use the front
i/o controller if you don't have
software available to you all right
let's actually peel this bad boy off
Paul go ahead and demonstrate like Vanna
White how it is to take off for a second
that that came off it Lesley yeah
beautiful beautiful face ball you can
also see some of those little latches on
there so taking a look at the back here
first off you get that massive CPU
cooler cut out a couple fan controllers
here there are six on each I believe six
or six of them on each so 12 fans PWM of
course yes absolutely very nice you also
get a couple SSD mounts behind the
motherboard tray that's always nice to
see that's one of my favorites have
actual orientations for SSDs these days
you'll also get this multi-purpose panel
on the back here fantex has actually
added a couple more cable management
velcro straps here for for extra
tidiness from what we saw back at
Computex and that's also really nice
they've also had this huge focus on not
wasting in each space in their case so
even if you don't happen to be using a
certain portion of their case you can it
can be used for for several different
things so of course you've got a bunch
of cable management space right here you
don't really have to worry about using
extensions or anything like that having
excess cabling there's always somewhere
to put it behind to be behind the
motherboard and down this lower
compartment so far from the cable
management you also get to pump mounts
they are universal you can put on pretty
much any pump you want
however again going with the whole
space-saving theme and not wasting any
space if you didn't want to be using a
pump in this system there's an included
bracket you can put in there for you to
the fan tech splitter or the power combo
again this is a dual the potential for a
dual system chassis so both of those
components come in real handy if you
don't happen to be doing any custom
water cooling where you need a pump in
this location you can definitely have
some multi-purpose action there but then
that's in a nutshell is project n2 elite
not project into really just m2 elite
you used to be project like 216 or now
two one six nine one six and that and I
still butcher until this day so I'm glad
which is something much easier for me to
remember in my oh my dear penis the enth
really guys it's out now go buy five of
them alright guys this is something you
probably haven't seen before unless you
watch somebody else's CES video before
mine that would suck but this is a
project to 1/7 or 217 or to 1/7 do you
have a preference no preference it's
whatever you want you know it's
customizable but basically this is a
bench it's a chassis that's meant to
just kind of flow naturally in a
home-theater environment you don't
really see too many projects like this
or too many cases like this where it
just kind of blends in very organically
it kind of has a monolithic look it's
kind of got this nice brushed gray
aluminum finish on the front however
they did say they were thinking about
doing all black as well just to make it
completely color neutral some things
like that you can see it's got tempered
glass on both sides and kind of a really
unique layout you can see also how small
the footprint is now the cool thing
about this case though is it doesn't
have to be in this orientation you could
put it on its side you can put on either
side actually you could even flip it
upside down I guess if you wanted to the
only side you probably wouldn't want to
do it on is the very back because
there's a couple cables here your power
cable for one is run out there an HDMI
of course or whatever video outs that
you might have but apart from that just
a very very nice unique design here you
can see there's like a horizontal bar
right in the middle it's kind of where
the cable management starts or at least
part of it and then lose like channel's
cable management channels that go on
both sides of the panels
there's also SSDs behind those panels so
there's queue on each side I believe so
a total of four drives which is pretty
nice as is in terms of flash storage
you've also got the the mini ITX board
mounted at the top there so kind of an
interesting configuration if you move on
down you can see if there's a 280
millimeter at the bottom so pretty nice
for such a small footprint to have that
kind of cooling potential in a case like
this there's also a small form-factor
power supply in here of course you could
actually put an ATX however you would
have to mount that horizontally on the
floor of the chassis at least in this
orientation that would technically cover
up the 140 millimeter fan at the bottom
and you would lose out at least the the
bottom radiator spot right there but it
does provide some flexibility depending
on your needs
now going back to that 140 millimeter
fan right there that's kind of like the
key of the central focus of how this
thing
it's cool there's a lot of intake
actually at the bottom a lot of bottom
ventilation and the air I'm sorry the
fan will actually pull the air up
throughout the entire chassis cooling
all the components inside and exhausting
it at the top if we take a look on this
side you're probably wondering where the
hell is the video cards actually on this
side and they've even managed to fit
freakin rez in there like an awesome
this case is pretty sweet I think the
price point they're talking about well
actually first up before I talk about
that this is project two one seven again
they're also making a project two one 7s
which is a smaller version maybe
slightly less radio support and things
like that but looks pretty much
identical through and through
apart from that price point is anywhere
from 100 250 you're saying yeah so the 2
and 7s would be about 100 150 for the
regular standard version that you're
seeing here which is actually very
reasonable for just the kind of support
you're getting and just a very unique
design so be sure to look out for this
sometime maybe during Computex in June
hopefully we'll be able to see a more
finalized product and maybe it'll even
be available before that event and we
can maybe do a few builds in it as well
on the channel so that's going to do it
for now guys let me know what you think
of this case it's very different I
personally like it a lot love to hear
your feedback in the comments below but
till next time be sure to stay tuned for
more CES coverage it confidence it's all
pause fault follows messing up and now
he's got me all messed up be sure to
stay tuned for more coverage CES 2017
and a huge shout out to my sponsors MSI
fractal design and of course cable mob
go ahead and check out their stuff in
the description below guys I'll see you
in the next one have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
