my room when I came across the very
chassis I built my first-ever gaming PC
with the Corsair graphite series 600 T
for a moment I froze as a wave of
nostalgia washed over me and that's when
I realized my tried-and-true mid-tower
was now over five years old but
functionally speaking had enough time
even past to make this case much
different than present-day offerings and
would it show any signs of age if I were
to try building with it today my first
impression was no but as I let the
thought simmer I began to recall
countless design changes we've seen take
hold in the last half decade making it
clear to me that this was a topic worthy
of further exploration so today I have
narrowed down four major updates but the
average tower chassis has undergone in
the last five years unsurprisingly the
first area of transformation is rooted
in aesthetics since 2011 the external
appearance of popular cases has become
increasingly minimalistic with
straighter lines and sharper edges
nearly bringing us full circle to a time
when more people would build bootable
cardboard boxes we've also seen a shift
from cases being slathered with
honeycomb mesh to solid paneling with
side ventilation that creates an overall
cleaner design while improving acoustics
now one of the things that 600 T had
going forward back then was that it
featured one of the bigger side panel
windows you could find that wasn't
hideously shaped like some skewed bust
of Gumby funny how awkward and small
this window looks now with the explosion
of LEDs infiltrating every internal
component imaginable the demand for
larger side panel windows to gawk at
them through has skyrocketed and now we
have cases that are basically just metal
frames surrounded by glass speaking of
which acrylic and plexi still dominate
side panel windows by a stretch but the
scratch resistance and sex appeal of
tempered glass is rising it to
popularity with every passing quarter
the last major cosmetic transformation
we're seeing more and more of is of
course built in RGB lighting it's still
not on every flagship chassis out there
but make no mistake this is only the
beginning
just as this guy now I wanted to save
our next category for last but the
impact it has on the chassis market is
so huge it really sets the stage for the
other areas will be discussing after so
with that said what exactly what a
modern-day mid-tower be without
pious amounts of water-cooling support
yes the onset of a wide range of
all-in-one liquid coolers and the
ever-present custom water cooling
community have forced case manufacturers
to rethink everything they know about
case design to put things in perspective
imagine how the community of today would
react after learning that the radiator
support of a new high-end mid tower was
limited to a single 240 red triggered
indeed these days it's not uncommon to
find a multitude of radiator mounts
inside a case often via those glorious
mounting strips which facilitate optimal
positioning and clearance compatibility
when you consider all the built-in
mounts for custom water cooling pumps
and reservoirs it's hard to imagine the
archaic world in which custom loop
enthusiasts once lived a few shifting
trends have also helped popularize the
front mounted radiator the decreasing
need for five and a quarter inch base
remember those the increase in hard
drive capacity and widespread SSD
adoption the last two of which have
allowed vendors to significantly
downsize or find alternatives to the
once adored hard drive cage without much
scrutiny but segues nicely to the next
big Reformation in case design which is
drive configuration well you can still
find modern cases with extensive drive
cage solutions small bays housing two or
three drives for the entire system have
become just as prevalent having fewer
hard drives makes them easier to mount
out of sight and that's exactly what
vendors have done by placing them under
the basement cover or opposite the
motherboard this rings half true for
SSDs as they to get mounts behind the
motherboard tray in some cases but since
society has deemed them more attractive
than hard drives case makers have found
ways to display them proudly with the
rest of the cool-kid components hello so
rounding out our list I can't think of a
new design move in the last five years
that's had a bigger effect on a cases
internal form and function than the
power supply shroud it may not seem like
much but once manufacturers started
covering up their power supplies
everything changed apart from giving
drives a new home as I just mentioned
the shroud solved many frustrating
issues such as hiding the heinous
sticker on your 80 plus ugly unit
assuming you never removed it and
helping you forget that the premium
sleeved cables going into your
motherboard are just extensions
harboring the ketchup and mustard filth
that lies beneath
then there's cable management quite
frankly being able to blindly stuff 90%
of my cables under the shroud
has made me a lazier cable manager when
building in a case that has one but when
I can put in half the effort in time and
get twice the results I don't really
care regardless of how you might feel
about it compartmentalizing the basement
offers a low-cost solution to a number
of issues that have plagued pc builders
for years we've seen plenty of fads come
and go in the PC market but I would bet
good money that the power supply shroud
is here to stay I'm just amazed how long
it took to catch on before we close out
the video some honorable mentions that I
couldn't find a place for on this list
include the USB 3.0 front panel
connector that replaced that god-awful
pass-through built-in pwm fan hubs and
one of my personal favorites captive
thumb screws oh yeah
if you guys would like to add anything
let me know in the comments what changes
you've seen in cases over the years and
while you're down there do toss me a
look on the video if you enjoyed it also
check out my store this is your last
chance to get that holiday discount so
you can get cool stuff and use the money
you save on more computer parts at least
that's what I do as always thank you
guys for watching subscribe and all that
good jazz and a Happy Holidays happy
holidays I don't see for Christmas
have a good one I'll see y'all in the
next video that was the worst ending
ever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
