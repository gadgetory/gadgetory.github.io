episode 185 what are we gonna do at 200
what do we do at 100 I don't think we
had any plans we're just like it's 100
we should have planned something it's
probably gonna be the exact same thing
for 200 maybe it's 200 whoa sorry whoa
whoa 200 we can go back and re-watch the
episode 100 make it like a make it like
a throwback punk I'll react to their
100th episode yeah on their 200th
episode and be excited about that maybe
we'll switch things up and silence our
cellphones all right well thank you very
much oh are you gonna pop that I was
good I was ready I was waiting for the
beer
disclaimer okay we'll get there so this
is a tech news show that Paul and I do
every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time right here on twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware we also streamed
to our respective YouTube channels in
two halves today we are streaming to my
channel first and then in about half an
hour so we'll switch over to Paul's
channel youtube.com slash Paul's
hardware we also like to occasionally
have a good drink or two on the show so
if you happen to be a legal drinking age
wherever you live you're welcome to join
us or you can just you know drink
Shirley Temple hey there it is and my
anxiety levels have skyrocketed they've
the plummeting now skyrocketed for a
moment - now they're much better a very
is very climactic and then a very very
quick dissipation there so um thank you
very much for joining us it's good to be
here and yeah this is delirium tremens
that we're drinking oh that's oh yes you
need my glass delirium tremens is a
fantastic beer it is a Belgian Tripel
or triple depending on how snooty you
are and it's quite delicious Paul and I
have been drinking this beer for years
and we will continue drinking it from
anymore so it's also a great if somewhat
dark name for a beer yeah yeah it is
it's a dark name for a light beer yes
that's true really it's quite quite
ironic but it's quite tasty as well
thank you guys for being here again
let's see we do have stores we have
stores where you can buy things that's
usually what stores are for Cheers
cheers to all of you mm-hmm
mm-hmm okay special occasion baby that's
what we'll do we'll have five bottles of
DT on our - I'm cool with that
so our stores our stores my store is big
with tech you can head there and pick up
a new shirt a brand new design the screw
with confidence inspired by our friends
at the verge was full and complete with
with hand and screw driver shouldn't be
so straight up about that they'll try to
get like can you get a strike from yeah
shirt couple your copyright check my
wardrobe back it's available in two
colors go ahead and check them out I
like them they're super comfy Paul also
has his brand new captive thumbscrew
shirt indeed which is a still still for
sales is whenever they oh yeah so this
is what it looks like a person as always
our friend John does really good
printing work yeah super clean my my
shirts from him have have been through
the wash like dozens and dozens of times
I don't know if we've mentioned in a
while but I I'm gonna bring it back up
right now the dye that's used in our
shirts is really cool because it sets
into the fabric if you've ever had a
shirt like this and thought I like the
design but whenever I get a shirt like
that it's like a it's like a not a
reasonable part across the front of me
and I get sweaty or whatever like that
feels puffy that's not how these shirts
work it sets in and it breathes just
like the fabric this is incredibly cool
anyone who's bought like I've never
gotten bad feedback from our store
saying when it comes to the stuff we
sell so right take that guys I've got a
bad feedback on us well I hate your guts
but your shirts are awesome yeah yeah go
ahead and check those out guys it really
helps us a lot and let's move on to our
first segment here which is tech news
we're gonna dive right in here and no
cell processing today he's busy doing
stuff for his family so sorry he
couldn't be here but wifey sauce I
believe I mission may be said too much
it's that too much up saying who are you
who are you modding for blue cells cover
the wife is Austin is Chad thank you
wifey fur for being here she's also
gonna be pasting
comments in the chat nice so thank you
thank you
alright let's move on to our first
article here from Tom's Hardware about
AMD celebrating their 50th year
anniversary which is crazy they've been
around for that long and they're
celebrating it with some hardware
patek potentially a special edition
Rison 720 700 X which has been leaked
this is gonna coincide potentially with
their May 1st anniversary date although
it's speculated that these chips will
actually launch a day early on April
30th 50 years 50 years worth then they
weren't even AMD back then they were ATI
right were they anything before ATI
really did they started as a 50 years
ago would have been 19 so you were be
never born
50 years ago was in 1969 I didn't even
think of that no I was not born not born
at that time thank you very much well
you jerk it's not what I heard Oh 1969
now I'm kind of 1969 like they bought
ATI but I don't think I think it's the
AMD root core company that I got it I'd
have to look back at their history or
something like that yeah
but alright okay sure I'll take their
word for it so we don't know exactly
what's gonna be special about this 2700
X people are speculating that Oh low
disk space I'm running out of love disco
Thank You Windows laptop struggles the
fans always ramping up when it's idling
we got Chrome open maybe that's why I
got Chrome but it's listed for pre-order
at 340 US dollars which is a bit of a
premium $45 over its $295 price point
for the regular standard edition but we
could potentially be looking at
commemorative packaging that if you're a
collector that sort of sticks out to you
engraving that'd be kind of cool if it
was a custom engraved CPU AMD is known
to do that we got some custom engraved
CPUs a thread ripper chips yeah I'm not
too long ago it also might include sort
of a fancy certificate saying that this
was you know personally I don't know
personally magnified blast personally
inspected by Lisa sook herself with the
fancy signature or something like that I
think it's up there but oh you're a lot
of us youtubers got special engraved
it's better for chips was it for the
first gen or second just second check
yeah that wasn't series yeah and then
great with our channel logos that's
enough I didn't give them my vector
image for my logo and time so that's
Paul's hardware I mean I'm still happy
it's your name is still on it better
percent it wasn't quite as cool as that
was my bad they asked for it and I
didn't follow up in time yeah so neither
here nor there like what else so that's
a decent premium they're tired of 40
bucks
45 dollars over what you pay right now
for 2,700 X yes and 2,700 X so we're
hoping it's something more than just the
packaging and you know RGB CPU be pretty
cool
I'm guessing Bend maybe maybe they're
there they're running at higher clock
speeds out of the box I mean cool or
they can at least you know be
overclocked to higher clock speeds that
would be nice as well
but who's to shit who's to shake who's
to Shea as they shake according to chat
by the way AMD has always been AMD you
know they've got the headquarters up in
Canada okay all I mean it's not that's
all I'm saying but but 80 I was probably
the one that was in 1969 it started in
nineteen no no no atia was a newer
company and ii bought AMD body TI oh
okay that's where the guys video gotcha
that was back in okay so a.m. dozen
seven
Oh someone in chat says Vicki I 80 I was
nineteen eighty five 85 was 80 I am D
was founded
May 1st 1969 ATI Tech was 1985 thank you
nuked Athlon man when we do without you
chat yeah you're very helpful so if you
guys aren't interested in any 50th year
anniversary rise in CPUs maybe you're
interested in an AMD 50th year
anniversary motherboard hey like the one
that's coming from gigabytes known as
the x4 70 horas gaming seven Wi-Fi 50
aptly named it's gonna feature some some
cool nifty features like a swappable
overlay next to the 24 pin connector i
believe it that's the LED portion this
yeah I think that's swappable you cannot
print you can 3d print your own that's
cool but it's not new it's not new they
know they've done more yeah that's true
so I don't see anything quite as unique
about this board as I've seen with or
speculating on the 2700 X if if it does
come with higher clock speeds it's been
it does look like it has good heat sinks
on the power delivery at least like the
real heat sinks like actually fins down
put your fins and everything not just
yeah all right
so that's kind of cool it's gonna have a
10 plus 2 face power delivery so 10
power faces that feed up to 40 amps to
the CPU and then the SOC or memory
controller is gonna get to power phases
rated for 50 amps so that sounds pretty
nifty as well a bunch of other features
on here none of which are particularly
unique you know you've got a couple n
dot two slots on there plenty of SATA 3
and USB as well 2 USB 3.0 headers down
there it looks like so it also it is
gonna support ddr4 memory as well as ECC
ddr4 so that's kind of its kind of
interesting if you wanted to maybe get
some more reliable memory in there but
um yeah I'd like to see you USB 3.1
connector oh there isn't one is there oh
sorry
right there yeah nevermind guys it's got
it it's blending its camouflage nice
feature set on the board at least it is
their pricing ya know price or
availability we're speculating
availability to to be around May 1st
perhaps a day early and then finally the
50th year GPU this is also from Tom's
Hardware there they're showing up a
Nitro+ Radeon rx 598 gigabyte AMD 50th
anniversary edition in case you just
wanted to own the GPU with the longest
possible name ever it's gold
hey that gold medalist yeah it looks
kind of yellow I would have never known
it was gold unless I read the article
seems way more yellow to me yeah I don't
know if they just blasted out the
picture or something like even the box
looks yellow I was like ooh it really
depends on the gold execution it should
be a bit more bronze I think it
- neon but it could just be the render
I'm not sure so it's supposed to be gold
allegedly dual 95 millimeter fans this
is pretty much the same styling as the
existing Radeon rx 590 Nitro+ special
edition special color it's gonna have a
stylish custom backplate providing
rigidity and passive cooling it's gonna
be packing the same specs exactly as the
non 50-year anniversary edition of this
card but the exact same 1500 and 60
megahertz booze clock so this seems to
be more of an aesthetic sell than
anything there's a backplate - there's
no that's yellow that's right you can
see because the in the picture the
connectors those are all fully gold
right gold has a little bit of orange
status the color of gold hinge for white
literally yeah in this picture and then
you have yellow next to it so yeah it's
either a really bad render or they just
don't know what the color gold is okay
and they're calling yellow gold I'm okay
with it being yellow just just call it
yellow say it say it like it is so
that's that it's probably the least
exciting of the 50th year anniversary
products but you guys let us know what
you think next up we have an article
from WCC F Tech also about AMD this time
in a very different vein it's about
their SOC that's expected to power the
next gen Xbox and Playstation Gonzalo is
the code name for the SOC and very
famous person Epis AK was first a spot
the AMD gonzalo SOC it's thought to be
the chipset that's gonna power the next
gen consoles that was earlier this year
he speculated that it was going to be
powered by AMD Xen and Navi tech
featuring eight cores with a base clock
of 1.6 and a boost clock of 3.2
gigahertz now at the SAC has found a new
entry of the SOC and the 3d mark
database of course someone keeps
forgetting to unplug that Ethernet cable
the Z at the beginning of the code name
indicates that this is a qualification
sample meaning that we're a lot closer
to the production stage than we
initially thought meaning that we could
possibly see next gen consoles arrive
later this
year potentially for a fall release
although the article speculates there
they're betting on 2020 as that year
especially because Sony will not be at
e3 this year it's the first time in the
conventions history that Sony won't have
a presence which ha can only mean that
the consoles are definitely not
launching this year in my opinion they
would totally be there if it was or just
or and I say this based on absolutely
nothing
it'll watch with just an idea that
popped into my head yeah maybe they're
gonna do like an Nvidia has done or
those mobile companies and others but
like they don't want to announce it at a
big event that lots of other
announcements are happening any
happening at so they backed out of that
one so they could put all the resources
into a special Sony only event that
they're gonna have where they will do
these no one to steal their thunder yeah
I've seen that happen before
yeah like I said I have no basis for
that but it's a it's a maybe we all know
you know we all know the connections you
have it Sony a big top stranger huge
PlayStation connections that I have this
PlayStation launches all the time you're
playing with so there's a French website
is your video which rumors that there
will be two Microsoft consoles to be
announced at this year's e3 a cheap
diskless model that'll be all digital
very much like the Xbox one digital
that's launching like this week or
something like that that's gonna be less
powerful and then of course there's
gonna be the the full-fat if you will
console with with all the beefy juicy
bits and install the inside of it so
that's gonna be a bit more you know 4k
heavy and have some fuller features I
would imagine so I guess keep your ear
to the ground about that if you care at
all about those things let's move on to
our next article here this is about this
this is sort of in relation to the title
of my half of this episode which is
YouTube sucks and I I think this article
illustrates it well there's a youtuber
known as modern vintage gamer he has
about a hundred and eighty thousand
subscribers so a pretty substantial size
you know it's not
massive but definitely you could build a
livelihood on on that especially if you
got the view counts there and he
recently announced that Nintendo was
flagging several of his videos about
emulating old games on the switch so
these are these were four videos that
were all flagged and strike down within
a week and they all happen to be switch
homebrew videos so they're all talking
about emulated games running on your
Nintendo switch which is still a very
current and popular and relevant console
and so mister MVG modern vintage gamer
known as Demetrius Jia nachus says that
they were all flagged and that he
believes that they they were used in
fair use that his videos fall under fair
use and that the reason Nintendo gave
for striking these videos was that was
for the inclusion of small amounts of
gameplay footage from games like Super
Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda a Link
to the Past so according to Nintendo
they weren't even striking him for
emulation they were striking him for
Content ID essentially just showing
images and footage of their games like
Nintendo has been very well known to do
from my understanding they had pulled
back on that because we've talked yeah
here's you asked about Nintendo being
very candid draconian about people
streaming Nintendo games I thought they
had realized that was a bad idea and
sort of pulled back from that but if
they are now using that same excuse of
streaming what they claimed to be their
copyrighted content for something else
which is obviously like you know if
you're showing people how to use an
emulator or something how to get
Nintendo games and play them without
paying for them then you could see why
they wouldn't want that to be out there
sure whether or not it's legitimate for
people to do that with their own
hardware right for games that they
already own yeah I would say yes they
should be able to do that yes and that's
actually what I'm saying he's using them
Tendo hardware too he's emulating them
on the switch that's not what I'm saying
hey get your PC and do this they're
still they would still need a Nintendo
hardware to do it yeah he's still
advertising Nintendo ecosystem at the
end of the day and he does state that he
owns physical copies legal physical
physical copies of all the games he
emulates in these videos so even if that
was the real cause
of why Nintendo striking him it would be
it just doesn't seem valid and so this
poor guy tried to refute all of these
claims and he was unsex unsuccessful on
all four so I don't know how many likes
if that counts is just one big strike
against his channel or if that's
multiple strikes obviously it can't be
three because then you're you're subject
to actual termination of your entire
channel but it's I was hoping for a
happier ending when I started reading
the article but it's kind of sad it just
says that he you know while he's
received some good advice about how to
mitigate future potential copyright
claims
unfortunately the threat is always there
and it's just not worth the trouble and
so he's decided that he'll no longer
make videos about the switch until it
becomes a legacy platform so he's
actually changing the style of his
content based on these I don't know
seemingly false allegations that he's
you know threat a threat to to
Nintendo's livelihood if anything it's
the other way around they're a threat to
his and and YouTube doesn't really seem
to be doing anything to support this
creator on their platform so it's it's
kind of unfortunate it definitely echoes
to you know how I was dealing what I was
dealing with with the verge when they
copy strike the Lisle video and it's uh
it's it's never fun to see your fellow
youtubers get hit with this sort of
thing from huge corporations and to not
have the platform that they've built
their business on not back them up it's
a it's definitely a sight to see so on
to further terrible news about YouTube
oh good because why stop there it's like
it's a mini segment here yeah so this is
an article from VentureBeat and there's
a developer I forget the name here it's
in the article but they've developed a
tycoon game about developing viola
monarch Ismail monarch thank you Paul
about developing a legal business where
you grow breed and sell marry J or a
good old-fashioned marijuana and Google
is classifying cheeba cheeba cheeba
cheeba grass
yeah Devils The Devil's cabbage Devils
Satan's bush so anyway Google is
classifying Let's Plays of the game as
not suitable for advertisers and they're
basically de monetizing anyone who's
making Let's Plays or gameplay videos of
this game and if you look at the game
it's a tycoon game it's like 2d mostly
2d and it's very like animated and
there's nothing like like the content
seems so innocuous it's really just like
any Tycoon game but replace variable X
with weed and and you have a game and
yet they're you know they're striking
these people noun de monetizing their
content which is really a two-fold its
it's hitting content creators who do
Let's Plays regularly and it's also
hurting the developers because now no
streamers or no gamers want to play this
game if they're not gonna be able to
make a living off of it or make some
money off of it so it's you know it goes
on to say the developer had no idea that
it would be this difficult to push this
game because of just how harmless the
content is especially since marijuana is
now it's increasingly becoming legalized
in more and more US states but there's
still that whole tricky element to it
being federally illegal schedule ones
what's that schedule one schedule one so
right there with your heroine and your
cocaine exactly and yet and yet you can
purchase it like it's you know milk at
the grocery store here in California and
many other states now they just hand it
out here they get a street without
somebody the supreme weed resamples
force feeding us and we're also
enlightened but it's like in California
accurate so so anyway it's also
interesting in somewhat hypocritical
that in YouTube's own Terms of Service
and their policy it says videos
discussing drugs or dangerous substances
for educational documentary and artistic
purposes are generally suitable for
advertising so long as drug use or
substance abuse is not graphic or
glorified and in nowhere in the game is
show does it show
like people there's no marijuana
glorification it's really just you're
running a business and you're
you know you see your numbers go up at
in the more weed that you breed and sell
there's no one using so absolutely so
Singh we've in the video so that was the
devil's advocate here you could say well
they're showing how how profitable it is
to grow and sell marijuana so obviously
you know that's why it's a objectionable
or whatever I have a suggestion though
for vile monarch the developer of weed
craft or perhaps devolver digital its
publisher if any of you guys are
listening reskin this game and call it
opiate craft yeah just sell opiates
right you know like your like your oxy
or whatever you're just theoretically
illegal if you have the right licensing
and stuff here in the United States but
is much more of a a problem in my
opinion a much more massive problem
right now yeah and see if see if it gets
through then I don't know I mean just to
see what the power dynamics are when it
comes to youtube do monetization of
subjects like that right just to sort of
see where you know on what site at Falls
that's that's my it's so twisted and
ass-backwards because if you did make it
about opiates I mean even the government
knows that weed is safe
excuse me safer than opiates otherwise
it would have legalized oxycontin and or
substances like vicodin without needing
a prescription just for recreational use
like it has with marijuana at least in
some states you would think but even the
government knows that's that's a
terrible idea because opiates are way
more addicting than any kind of strain
of marijuana and yet that's that's a
great suggestion that Paul just made to
skin it with some seemingly my way more
dangerous drug and suddenly it's way
more legal the system is so fucked up
but one that companies like like are not
company oh that's the company the family
is the Sackler z-- the company is weed
company the company that makes oxycontin
oh oh I don't know a bunch of stuff
coming up about them anyway the families
of Sackler is that's the company called
Walmart that's gonna help me out
I'm sure chip Purdue Purdue Pharma shoes
okay yeah yeah everything they're doing
is super legal oh yeah oh yeah they're
just they've found a way to skirt the
system
Thank You Chet everyone in chat chats
wonderful I love you guys I also I also
wonder like and this was just a thought
this wasn't in the article but how many
like music videos have I seen on YouTube
on like you know massive channels that
just feature this the obligatory or just
like the explicit use of marijuana or
even like crazier drugs I've seen in
music videos that have millions and
millions of views no problem and these
are real people smoking real drugs and
this is a this is a bunch of pixels that
people are interacting with like I just
it makes me think that some advertiser
caught wind that their ads were playing
on this game and they just threw a shit
but see your example there you're
talking about like a band or a music
group or something like that
who is picked up by like a big label as
well as like a distribution company
right with lots of money and of course
lawyers yeah who can go to court and be
like no this was this was creative use
of the drug abuse and everything like
that but but youtubers don't have access
to that so yeah these are unique small
indie developers there were small indie
developers yes yeah so kind of exposes
this this is a good point this in sort
of an unfair way that you're treated
depending on whether you have the
backing of right a company with a bunch
of lawyers yep or not I guess illegal
all right so yeah YouTube sucks let's
all forget about those last two stories
they were dropping a bunch of frames all
of a sudden okay I'm just kidding
oh they're watching hey at least they
watch your shit so this is an article
from an antic don't worry game support
now we're moving on to oh one last plug
of this quick article from an aunt oh
never mind
we're not game support it I promise
it'll be quick so sharp demonstrated off
their demonstrated their 8k 120 Hertz
monitor so all your all you monitor
fanatics and can cock on that its HD are
actual like good H
you are I think it's probably like HDR
thousand or something like that 76 80 by
4320 resolution with a 120 Hertz native
refresh rate with a IGZO tech display
and Sharpe is evaluating they're
strongly considering it seems like
they're leaning towards releasing this
LCD to the community or commercially
click here to make image smaller okay
why would you love that feature so I
mean there's really not much to say here
other than we could be looking at a
potential 8k 120 Hertz option from sharp
in the near future
no no word on pricing or availability
again they're not even decided yet that
they're gonna release it it may very
well require up to four DisplayPort 1.4
cables just get the full native
resolution going because of how much
bandwidth that requires which is
probably not gonna sell well to you know
your n your average end-user but for
professional use and power users I'm
sure they're not gonna have a problem
it's it's a K they're there make it work
do you remember this sort of awkward
in-between time when 4k panels are first
starting to come out but weren't
natively supported by a DisplayPort 1.4
and stuff like that where you needed to
yeah and there were these weird panels
that were they look like one panel but
it's actually two panels and you need
two cables to plug in and it works most
of the time but it's kind of quirky and
has you know things you need to do to
filtrate and get the drivers right and
everything yeah that's what that is
but that's what happens when the the
pixel an LCD tech advances faster than
the cable tech I will say I'm impressed
that they're coming straight out with a
hundred twenty Hertz though usually you
see the resolution like Oh 8k or
whatever like super high resolution and
refresh rate tank it it's it's nice that
they're pairing it up with that high
refresh rate cuz yeah 60 Hertz is
difficult to game on once you've once
you've become accustomed to higher
refresh rates than that right to say
nothing of 30 years but yeah and if
you're gonna spend that much on one
speck chances are you're gonna want the
other specs of that product to match it
you know and to be it's be substantial
for a while so let's move on to games
report that's all for straight tech news
for today but we've got some interesting
stories here this is an article from PC
gamer
about EA's promised to
of no loot boxes and Jedi fallen order
what you would think people would rant
and rave about and praise you thank you
EA for this announcement but it has
backfired so there was a tweet from EA
Star Wars official account about the
game it said no micro transactions no
loot boxes and no we won't be adding
them a single-player Star Wars story for
those of you who are ready to become a
Jedi
you would think it'd be met with
applause but no it backfired like a
freaking bombshell and it basically
reminded everyone gave it a flashback to
battle from Battlefront 2 and what a
disaster that was with all the micro
transactions and loot boxes I don't need
to explain it but basically what it what
it seemed like EA was doing is they were
they were they were showing you that
this game lacks any of the flaws that a
game shouldn't have in the first place
and yet they were advertising it as a
selling point look at how great this
game is it's not broken it's not
terrible yeah well that's the bare
minimum of what we were what we would
expect so fans were outraged and
arguably so I think they had a right to
be fallen order has you know as the
article states this game has enough hype
to carry itself it's story driven it's
single-player which I think a lot of
people have been wanting in a Star Wars
game for a while and it has lightsaber
combat they brought that back which is
quite tantalizing at least in my opinion
so EA is just you know even though they
had good intentions with this
announcement it kind of blew up in their
faces whether or not that's gonna
actually impact sales I think eventually
it'll blow over but it just definitely
goes to show how detached some
developers or publishers can be from the
community and I don't know they need to
do a rehiring process or something for
their social media because it's it ain't
good it ain't a good luck EA so you guys
let us know I'm not crying I'm not
crying chat I'm just I'm just I'm just
saying I'm trying to feel what the
community feels and I can I can
empathize it's it's interesting cuz I I
kind of caught a little bit of this when
it was first coming out and I thought
what you were gonna say was there was
months that I had heard from people but
it was actually different so the the
negative feedback that you're talking
about is people saying like oh thanks he
thanks EA this game doesn't come with a
punch in the dick when I buy it like
that's that's great you know thanks for
leaving that out yeah what I heard about
it was like that they would it so what
did what was their actual statement no
microtransactions no loot boxes no we
won't be adding them single-player Star
Wars story there's a lot of things that
they could monetize the game with that
aren't micro transactions or loot boxes
absolutely so a lot of people were
saying are ITA we don't necessarily
believe you with this because like how
much is it gonna cost for skins or like
these kind of things or the game itself
like is there gonna be a bunch of
episode I like part of the storyline
that suddenly becomes like an expansion
pack that should've been part of the
original game but now you got a
pantograph $29 for that or something
like Zachary there's lots of other ways
that EA could screw this up I guess
right so well it is refreshing for them
to come out and say this because it does
show some awareness that people don't
like these things and that there's
really it's been really pervasive and
annoying when it comes to especially a
title like a Star Wars title like people
are really really wanting a really good
Star Wars game to get into sure but they
could just be I go you say they could
just be rescanning the same sins that
they did yeah there's other ways that
they could screw this up
they're not promising not to do here
right so you know well-well-well
believed that EA is making an awesome
Star Wars game when it launches and
their reviews are good and all that good
stuff I wish they could still do yeah I
would love to live in a time where EA is
like praised and looked upon as like a
decent company yeah I want I want
because it's better for the community
but I also wouldn't put it past them if
if they fall into the trap that Paul was
just laying it I'd also love to see like
an up-and-coming indeed up-and-coming
indie developer suddenly get the Star
Wars license with something to prove
yeah and you know just do Billy I know
the game that way you know something
like that super cool all right so all
right good vibes here let's move on to
our next article from ours
nikka about open AI bots crushing dota 2
champions and and just the sing what's
up with that so open AI is a startup
company and they've been developing this
bot this smart learning bought over the
years it's been playing millions it's
already played millions of matches
against itself learning waiting for its
victims to approach it and demolish it
so it actually went up against Oh G
which is an eSports team that won the
biggest competition in all of eSports
last year which was the international so
you have this elite award-winning
eSports team going up against a bot
essentially in dota 2 and it was just
kind of a nice there's a cool little
social experiment just to see how how
far a AI is advanced especially in the
realm of gaming and so they actually had
to nerf some of the open a eyes
abilities the the reaction time was are
to artificially slowed to ensure that
the game wasn't just a test to see you
know who had the you know fastest
reflexes and stuff but the results of
the first game were that the bots came
out ahead in a teamfight now bear in
mind that the bots have so dota 2 has
five players five on five and the the
five players on the eSports team were
five individual people but the bots had
five individual programs I guess that
weren't really communicating with each
other like like the team was so they had
that disadvantage but they're all
programmed and have learned to think
very similarly so it gives the illusion
that they are working together as a team
and feeding off of each other's
reactions and being very responsive but
it's actually kind of one of their
downsides still during the first game
the bots killed three human players
while only losing one themselves and
albeit to their credit the human team
the eSports og team was actually able to
hold out for like 30 40 maybe even 50
minutes in the round which is pretty
good the second game however which was
kind of like all right let's see if if
this is a repeatable behavior the human
team sad for for og they got crushed
they actually got their asses handed to
them in like the first 20 minutes or
something
and it says yeah though the bots can't
communicate with each other all five
computer-controlled players think in the
same way if one thinks that it's a good
opportunity to attack a human player the
other four of them will think the same
and will join the attack so it's kind of
like a mob mentality AI style and so
this this basically gives the appearance
of a really good coordination in
teamfights
and it's sort of a coordination and a
precision that human teams just can't
really match right now the article does
go on to say that the bot does seem
beatable there are certain things
there's an element in in the game called
pulling that's referred to as pulling
I'm not exactly sure what that means
it's it's sort of like a technique you
don't play dota 2 all the time I am NOT
a dota 2 player but there's a there's
certain human actions in the game that
the bot does not understand or recognize
so when a team starts to pull as it were
the bot doesn't really know what to do
it doesn't really it doesn't know it
doesn't have that pattern locked into
its memory so it doesn't really know how
to respond so there are certain
loopholes as as there are with any bot
that you could maybe exploit to
potentially beat it but in this
demonstration it seems to completely
wipe the floor with even the potentially
the world's greatest dota 2 team so yeah
say say your prayers and thank your
robot overlords now before they decide
to incinerate you into dust I want to
see open AI take control of like robots
in real life and then go up against
humans in real life because I feel like
Mary I feel like this is kind of like
entering Tron's game grid or something
like that you're in their world right
yeah but yeah like when when wasn't when
the AI can take control of like your
Boston Dynamics robots and then beat
humans which is like probably very soon
that's probably yeah that's not fool
ourselves but I must always looks
terrified probably because he knows it's
coming any day now but it's good to know
that they're there they're there
providing some nerfs to the bots too
like you
it's not like some hive mind controlling
them all at the same time and the
reaction time that's very important to
like instantaneous reaction time that
you know that software can can pull off
that humans cannot right this is a
massive advantage but you know that's
all gonna be unlocked when they decide
to enter our world and oh yeah and make
a fight like it's a great idea of us
that are gonna I don't know what you're
talking about
this is we need to give these oh we need
to give this AI like powerful technology
robots may be weapons just then just set
it loose and and and you know like a
metropolitan center or something like
that if you love something I know I'd be
a great reality TV show just six cameras
oh you want it this oh boy
future's looking great all right so
let's move on to our last article here
from the games report which is also from
PC gamer this is just a quick little
snippet about gearbox a very popular
developer of Borderlands 3 hinting at
certain secrets little hidden gems in
their cover art they actually shared a
high-res image as a hint for internet
investigators so if you wanted to sort
of play the game and try to find out
more little Easter eggs in the game you
can do so now
it contains if you look closely it
contains the Morse code message
discovered last week that tints at the
return of the destroyer I don't remember
what the destroyer was from Borderlands
was that in Borderlands 2 or do you
remember the decision I'm thinking of
the destructor which is from
ghostbusters so I don't have the
traveler no destroyer claptraps
destroyer of the worlds well maybe
that's what it is no this is just a
random gameplay video okay you only have
7,000 views I'm sure they have some good
content so anyway there's there's a
bunch of Easter eggs in here people the
internet have started discovering them
but more will be revealed instead of
having to magnify glass this those
artwork goes there the destructor
those are the traveler that is destroyer
he says she says the destructor
destructor destroyers just okay goes are
the destroyer that sounds familiar
yeah the destroyer was just very vague I
couldn't it's been so long since
borderline - that was we were still
working at Newegg we were playing
together Wow
I was I was an assassin assassin respond
I remember it was good when Borderlands
2 is a viable benchmark cuz it had a
built-in one that was actually a pretty
solid representation it was not fell out
of practice because it was it repeatable
benchmark you're in yeah but yeah it's
been it's been oh yes that's right goes
are the traveler gozer the gozerian
demands that you choose the form of the
destructor and that's thank you chat
again amazing shad is like a like a
boundless fount of yeah and then and
that's then the Simmons the form of the
destructor which is a Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man which is the first thing
that Rey can think of so that was that
was a that was a no wonder sound
familiar was a Ghostbusters reference
yes not a monster that's what I do I
just very completely away from what
you're trying to talk about so if you
guys didn't want to guess around at the
artwork and just kind of like waste time
on that you could just wait for the
worldwide gameplay reveal event that's
gonna be on May friggin first which is
also the 50th year
AMD anniversary hey so get your special
edition 2700 X and enjoy some real-time
gameplay from Borderlands 3 the event
will feature the first ever showing of
gameplay of the title as well as
commentary from the gearbox dev team on
everything from the new vault hunters
and their respective skills which I'm
very curious about - interplanetary
travel and sweet sweet loot
interplanetary travel so we're gonna be
going to different planets this time not
just different areas on the same globe
that's kind of interesting it'll be at
10 a.m. Pt we can wake up that early
