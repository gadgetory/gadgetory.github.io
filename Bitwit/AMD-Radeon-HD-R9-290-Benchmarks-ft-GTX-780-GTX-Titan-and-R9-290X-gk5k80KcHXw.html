awesomesauce news today I'm very excited
to present to you all the r9 290 video
card from AMD now this is their latest
video card in their Radeon HD series
lineup and it is the smaller or younger
brother to the r9 290x which AMD
recently launched and I say that because
well they're almost twins in a way
because they feature the same Hawaii GPU
the same GCN architecture there's just a
few differences in specs but I'd say the
biggest difference between this new card
and the 290x is that is the price relief
so right now the 290x is $150 more
expensive at least at the time of
filming this video then the r9 290 and
as we're about to take a look at some
benchmarks in just a bit here in this
video you can gauge for yourself whether
or not you think that price premium is
worth the additional performance that
you'll be seeing out of the r9 290x and
I actually have the r9 290x with me
right here these are exactly the same
reference design coolers this is
straight from and from AMD and this is
actually a sapphire card you can see the
Sapphire sticker on their buttstock
clock frequency everything is referenced
the cooler and everything is exactly the
same as the reference design that I have
here with me on the 290x so with that
said why don't we take a look at some of
the specifications of this card and see
how they differ to the r9 290x okay I'm
gonna run through these specs pretty
quick here and once again you can see
that the two 90 and the 290 X both share
the same Hawaii GPU as far as the clock
speeds go we're going from 662 megahertz
that's the base clock all the way up to
947 megahertz but that is a little bit
less than the 290 X at 1 gigahertz
frequency but still not terrible you're
still gonna get a higher clock speed
than the GTX 780 as well as more stream
processors than the GTX 780 not quite as
many as the 290x you do have 2560 stream
processors there with the 290 video
memory all the frame buffer specs are
pretty much identical between the 290
and the 290 X so you're gonna get four
gigs of VRAM gddr5 clocked at an
effective memory speed of 5 gigahertz
320 gigabytes per second for memory
bandwidth on a 512 bit memory interface
now before we start I cannot emphasize
this enough please listen to me I run
all of my video cards at stock
frequencies that is why my numbers are
the same as other reviewers I hope
that's clear enough
and the cold hard truth is I'm not
changing the way I benchmark cards
because I feel it's the one thing I can
do exactly the same as everyone else
versus the one or two guys who are
running their cards overclocked so if
your complaint is well those guys are
running the cards overclocked why are
your numbers different why are you even
looking at my numbers if you know
they're going to be different if you
want to see overclock benchmarks go to
any one of the literally one or two
dudes who are running them and go look
at them there without further ado here
your benchmarks
alright guys that is gonna wrap it up
for this overview and benchmark video
once again this has been AMD's Radeon HD
r9 290 video card and given the
performance numbers you've seen here
today which of the big three and I'm
gonna exclude the GTX Titan because it's
$1000 and it's stupid out of the r9 290
the r9 290x as well as the gtx 780 which
one would you go with all things
considered price performance heat output
power draw all the features you get with
AMD vs and video respectively tell me
why in the comments section below I'd
love to hear your thoughts and thanks
