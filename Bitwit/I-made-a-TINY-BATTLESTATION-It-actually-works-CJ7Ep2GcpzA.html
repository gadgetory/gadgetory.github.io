mobile it's like the hardest thing right
now it's pretty fun how about you what
are you playing over there oh I'm just
playing some pub G non mobile nice power
chord nerd fuck man
I'm gonna mean the core p90 TG from
thermaltake sports an open-air design
and a prism shaped body surrounded by 5
millimeter thick tempered glass for a
spectacular view from any angle a trio
of compartments housed full-size
hardware and expansive support for
custom water-cooling
all of which can be shown up vertically
horizontally or even on your wall to
learn more click the link in the
description for more info so as you guys
might expect today I'll be putting
together a miniature PC gaming setup not
necessarily because it's practical or
even a good idea but because I can I've
rounded up a special list of hardware to
help me along my fun-sized journey
starting with the Intel nook a mini PC
fitted with a 7th gen Intel Core i5 7260
u processor with 2 cores 4 threads and a
max turbo frequency of 3.4 gigahertz
this Nook is a bare-bones model so we'll
be adding our own storage in memory
including an 8 gigabyte som kit of
Crucial Ballistix sport ddr4 at 2400 our
drive is the samsung 960 pro which is
totally overkill for our needs but it's
the only 500 gig m2 SSD I actually had
on hand so into the Nook it goes since a
tiny setup calls for tiny peripherals I
picked up the IU nagar 5 inch capacitive
touchscreen a popular choice for the
Raspberry Pi craft powered by microUSB
the display boasts an 800 by 480
resolution 60 Hertz refresh rate and a
full-sized HDMI input we'll be
connecting it to the Nook with a flat
HDMI cable and a right-angle HDMI
adapter just to make our connection look
a bit cleaner my keyboard of choice was
a Bluetooth model from ICI technology
that folds out to be just large enough
to fit
fingers on those WASD keys it features 3
channel pairing for on-the-fly switching
between three connected devices and the
switches are surprisingly tactile for
such a keyboard naturally a gamer is
only as good as his mouse so today I'm
going to suck more than usual
while the Logitech M 187 is in my
opinion the weakest link in the group
$9.00 still gets you a super portable
pointer with left and right clicks a
scroll wheel and a 2.4 gigahertz
wireless connection via the included USB
receiver finally it wouldn't be a battle
station without the sounds of war so
here we have the kinivo zx100 which
delivers decent sound quality for its
size great battery life and to built an
eighth inch cable to avoid any
audio/video sync issues during our
gameplay and that is our pocket-sized PC
gaming setup I'll drop links to
everything here in the description if
you guys are interested but without
further ado let's see if this thing
actually works alright it's all hooked
up this was a great idea look at little
icons they're so cute
I have a strong feeling that we can run
csgo so we're gonna start with that and
we might try another game assuming that
this doesn't immediately fail I do have
fraps running so we have a frame counter
in the top left corner there so you guys
can actually see what kind of
performance we're getting in game so I'm
gonna go into my video settings here and
you know that it's it's actually a
pretty crisp screen surprisingly like I
feel so far away from the screen because
all the text is really tiny but I can
read it perfectly fine it's super sharp
and it looks like we are running at the
native resolution of 800 by 480 Auto
settings have deemed this nook capable
of running csgo at anywhere from very
low to high settings okay I'm gonna play
with some bots because I'll feel too bad
if I'm actually on anyone's team loading
up into dust tube for the record this
mouse would be perfect for like a
three-year-old child
but that's it we're hovering at around
66 fps oh it's just jumping all over the
place depending on where we're looking
of course now we're at in the in the low
hundreds it's actually pretty darn
smooth is that a is that a guy Oh Oh
first kill on the mini PC glorious it's
kind of difficult knowing who my friends
are because they're so small Hey
Oh Oh head shot the head shots are way
harder with this monitor I'm not feeling
it yet but I would imagine that gaming
on this setup for a long period of time
would result in severe eye fatigue oh
and there I go setup small I do wish the
keyboard had some rubber feet to keep it
from sliding around when things get
intense I tend to but I would love to
bring this to a Starbucks and just watch
people's reactions I'm sure it would
turn a lot of heads and provoke a lot of
questions like does he have any friends
so honestly guys we're getting anywhere
from 60 to 100 plus FPS right now at
once again 800 by 480 resolution not too
bad
let's try topping I bet I'd be a great
off on a miniature set up and sure
enough I am this probably isn't as
convenient as a laptop I'll admit but
it's way funner dropping like flies
all right we won cuz we're awesome let's
switch gears here see if this thing can
handle some doom all right so our iris
plus graphics are doing a pretty decent
job here at medium settings we're
getting in the mid 40s right now guys
40s to 50s very very playable no-one
should fall apart that easily you guys
need to drink more milk
you know the setup is actually I have to
give it credit it's a lot nicer to game
on than you might expect and I think
that's probably why I haven't said
anything in like the last minute or two
because I'm just I'm actually kind of
immersed in this game right now
I got grenades do this yeah thank God
this mouse has a scroll wheel otherwise
I wouldn't have been able to throw
Natick you who you ugly you ugly man
this totally beats out mobile gaming who
even needs phones these days
with a setup like this come on clash of
clans step aside
candy crush you've been crushed this is
the future of gaming ladies and
gentlemen I'm getting a little cramp in
my finger whoa I need to drink hold on
sorry guys okay we're good
okay I think we have destroyed every
tiny demon in sight
so I'm gonna call it for now this has
been quite an experience and really a
big surprise it's the biggest little
surprise I've received in a long time
just how fun and enjoyable this was
definitely exceeded my expectation so
very cool if you guys would like to see
any more content about this miniature
setup moving forward if you have any
creative ideas let me know in the
comments I'd be totally open to it
apart from that guys toss a like on the
video if you enjoyed it you can also
follow us on floatplane if you want to
watch our content a week early without
ads I'll put a link for that in the
video description guys thank you so much
for tuning in have a good one and I'll
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
