quick unboxing an overview of a very
special pair of headphones that I
recently ordered for myself for personal
use at home these are the biodynamic dt
880 pros end of the 250 ohm version so
just a quick look at the front of the
box here we can see the 880 pros or at
least the side of one of the ear cups
and the picture kind of extends off to
the side there showing you some of the
velour padding other than that there's
not too much information here oh then
they let you know that there is a
carrying case included for storage and
travel taking a look at the back of the
box now we can see some specifications
that the manufacturer is listed so first
off these are dynamic headphones but
more specifically these are semi-open
headphones and the main thing you need
to know there is that there are two main
different types of headphones you've got
clothes back and open-back headphones
and with closed back headphones you
actually have an enclosed ear cup so
what that allows for is more noise
isolation you're not going to have much
sound coming in you're not going to have
much sound coming out of your headphones
so that's really good if let's say
you're in a noisy environment and you
want a more private listening experience
or for example let's say you're
recording a podcast and you don't want
the noise or sound to leak out of your
headphones into the microphone that
you're recording with go with a pair of
closed back headphones the difference
between that and open-back headphones is
that open-back headphones have holes or
perforations on the side of their ear
cups and what that allows for is yeah
it's not going to be as great at noise
isolation you're going to hear some of
this stuff from the outside world when
you're listening to whatever it is
you're listening to but the holes on the
side actually allow for air to pass
through and what that does is it gives
these types of headphones a different
sound signature and a lot of people have
described this sound signature as being
more natural more open and even a little
bit more Airy than you would get with
closed back headphones so this is really
good if you want a more honest listening
experience and this is also because of
the air passing through you're also
going to get a wider soundstage so
you're going to have more perceived
depth and height and width of sound
you're going to be able to tell more
accurately where your sound is coming
from when you're listening to movies or
when you're playing video games which is
kind of why I went with the semi-open
because it's a happy medium middle
ground between close back and open back
headphones so moving on we've got a
nominal frequency response of 5 to 35
thousand Hertz like I said before this
is the 250 ohm edition this these pair
of headphones also come in 32 and 600
ohms I kind of went with the middle
ground once again with 250 it's got a
nominal SPL of 96 decibels it's got a
nominal THD of less than 0.2% and the
power handling capacity is 100
milliwatts aside from that we've got
some other useless information this is a
coiled cable this this pair of
headphones also comes in the premium
edition these are the pros that I got
but the premium actually is exactly the
same use the same drivers it's just a
little bit different aesthetic wise and
it also comes with a straight cable but
for this for the case of this video
these are the pros and it comes with a
coiled cable and connection wise we've
got a gold-plated stereo mini jack
that's 8 inch but they've also included
a quarter inch adapter so they have it
all enclosed in the carrying case which
is a soft fabric bear dynamic on the
front of it it's got two zippers right
here and this is the first thing you see
there's a bunch of documentation popping
out at you here we have your warranty
information as well as some product
information in multiple languages and
got some silica as we all know that's
delicious save it for a rainy day and
here we have your beautiful headphones
themselves aboveboard say I just want to
mention that the inside of the case is
fully padded with foam and it's got a
nice big indent there for your
headphones to rest in really good for
storage and travel it's a little bit big
it's probably a lot bigger than it needs
to be if you're like traveling somewhere
and you want to be portable but it
definitely is good to to keep around
just in case you want to store it for a
long period of time so here are the
headphones let me get the coral out of
the way accord of the way first
it's a coiled cable as I mentioned
earlier as you can see here we've got
your connector focus my son alright so
here you can see the quarter inch jack
connector it's gold-plated this is
actually the adapter it's just they've
already screwed it on for you but you
can screw it off there's your eight inch
jack right there also gold-plated
so taking a look at the headphones
themselves we can see that these are
semi-open back because there are holes
perforated on the side of the ear cups
on both sides you can actually see dt
880 Pro printed in light grey on both
sides of the headphones so you can show
that off the majority of the frame of
the ear cups are plastic so this kind of
grey area and the black
that's all plastic but the arm that's
connected to the ear cups are our full
metal and that kind of runs all the way
through underneath this I believe this
is synthetic leather but it still looks
really nice and I think that our buttons
here you can pop them off they actually
do come off so you can replace this
leather band if you ever need to or if
you want to wash it give it a good
cleaning you can do so aside from that
we've got really nice velour pads on the
ear cups and these are around ear so
they go completely around your ear we're
kind of big I'll show you what they look
like I mean just a sec but they are
extremely comfortable I could probably
wear these for hours on end without any
problem at all there just want to sleep
on I want a pillow I want an entire bed
made out of this material it's just a
velvety soft fabric it's just awesome
aside from that you can see that the
cable on the cord that it comes with is
attached you cannot detach the cable
keep that in mind and let's see on the
side right here you can see it's got
bear dynamic with their logo and it also
indicates left or right your cup it's
even got it in Braille very thoughtful
touch one last thing I did want to point
out is that the sides of the ear cuffs
are adjustable so they can go out or
back in like that so depending on the
size of your head you should be able to
adjust it to your liking no problem
lastly guys just want to show you really
quick what these headphones look like on
my head so there you go
it's kind of a bad reference eye now
because you have no idea how big my head
is in real life but that's all I got
that's all I have to say about the
beyerdynamic dt 880 pros once again it's
the 250 ohm version that you all for
