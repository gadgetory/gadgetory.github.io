what about password management if your
passwords are easy enough to remember
they're definitely not safe enough and
if you make them super complex well then
you have to write them down somewhere
and desperately hope you have access to
them when you need them
needless to say all the methods of
password management I've tried in the
past either compromised security or
convenience which is why - Lane is the
perfect solution I've been looking for
the services password generator lets you
create passwords up to 40 characters
long with your choice to include digits
letters symbols or all of the above not
only did the passwords get backed up
securely - - lanes database but they
autofill any time you're at a login
screen so logins become insanely fast
with zero headache the app is also
supported on all major platforms so you
can use and manage passwords from your
desktop your smartphone and countless
other devices I've been so impressed by
the service so far that I'm actually
gonna keep using it long after producing
this well made advertisement - lean is
free to try so there's no risk in giving
it a whirl you can check it out now in

in great again with - Lane what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel
today we're gonna be exploring the topic
of whether or not you actually need a
graphics card to game on a PC now of
course having a discreet card is gonna
help you tremendously if you're trying
to hit super high frame rates and you
want that buttery smooth experience and
you've got enough cash to do so but
since the graphics card market is what
it is right now if price is being still
more or less inflated and we have these
new rise in AP use on hand that are
actually the fastest on the market right
now
it begs the question do you actually
need a graphics card to game comfortably
and what kind of performance can you get
away with if you're fully pimping out a
system that only has an APU with
integrated graphics so today we're gonna
be exploring that topic with with a
number of games that I've picked out
some that are less demanding some that
are more demanding and we're gonna be
using this as our sort of testing
subject which is the mini PC that I
built in the part 1 video you should
check that out
yet inside the in wind Chopin using a
risin 5 2400 G which is a fork or a
thread part and not much has really
changed you can see that I did make the
modification if you haven't seen the
part one I did modify the case cut out
some of the mesh that we can fit a
larger rate spire cooler as this case is
pretty limited on its zee clearance for
CPU coolers we wouldn't really be able
to get away with much overclocking at
all fortunately I was able to clog both
the CPU and GPU portions of the chip
which we're also going to talk about
momentarily so let's let's talk about
that now actually we have again the 2400
G with a current overclock on all four
cores
to 3.7 gigahertz now that's actually
fairly low most people have been able to
get away with 3.9 gigahertz without
really even messing with the voltage
much but when I was trying that even
going to 3.8 gigahertz
I kept crashing in fortnight's that was
the one gain I kept going back to to
test with and I would just crash out
every single time until dialing it back
to 3.7 gigahertz so well it's only a 100
megahertz bump on all cores over our max
turbo frequency on this chip it is
running rock-solid stable and to be
honest I was more concerned about
overclocking the graphics side of things
which we do have a Vega 11 graphics chip
built into that apu of course with 11
cores and the stock speed of that chip
is I believe it's twelve hundred and
fifty megahertz I was actually able to
bump that up to thirteen hundred and
twenty-five and actually in practice
it's more like thirteen hundred and
nineteen you'll see that on the GPU see
later on when it comes to memory I
actually had that's the one modification
I had to make to the system since the
last video was I had to take out the
g.skill ripjaws v kit because it just
wasn't cutting it for whatever reason I
couldn't post at the rated 32 hundred
megahertz speed I couldn't even get away
with three thousand to be honest so I
swapped these out for some you know
arguably higher quality RGB Triton z RGB
sticks from also from g.skill and was
easily able to post at 3200 speed on the
first try now going back to the
fortnight testing
I kept crashing in fortnight at that
speed so I had to dial back the memory
speed to 3000 and now we're sitting
pretty at 3,000 megahertz so for
whatever reason for tonight's being kind
of finicky right now
I'm not exactly sure why but 3.7
gigahertz on the CPU thirteen hundred
and twenty five megahertz on the GPU and
three thousand megahertz on our memory
so that's kind of what we're working
with right now and I think right now we
can just jump into some games and kind
of just see what performance were
getting so I'm gonna start off with
fortnight since I've already been
talking it up and we'll just jump it and
see what happens all right so run around
here outside out in the wild you can see
we're getting around 40 to 50 fps we're
in the forties range there's actually
pretty good and if you're curious about
our settings let me just stand here in
the open so people can shoot me right
into medium settings with the exception
of anti-aliasing that's running it high
because a medium anti-aliasing in this
game looks like poop but you know what
even a medium settings fortnight looks
pretty darn good at 1920 by 1080 you can
also notice that we're using about six
and a half gigs of system memory right
now now remember I had to make that
memory switch the last minute so we're
actually using a really overkill kit of
tried NZ there's actually 32 gigs of
memory in here right now which is not
necessary but at the very least I would
recommend at least 16 gigs if you're
gonna run a similar operation to this
one because we barely have you know if
we only had eight gigs in there that's
not enough overhead it's very little
sealing room for additional applications
running in the background while you're
gaming such as you know discord or
Twitter and so forth so also we've got
let's see we're eating it up our full
two gigs vram right now made sure to
enable two gigs supported frame buffer
in the UEFI memory is also running at
1500 megahertz and GPU once again
thirteen hundred and 20 megahertz
thereabouts CPU is about thirty percent
utilization
not too shabby and if you look at our
temperatures I'm not sure if you can see
it but we are right now at 73 degrees
Celsius on the package so that's that's
actually pretty good you know our mod is
coming in handy cutting out that piece
of mesh and allowing us to fit a bigger
stock cooler in there is really doing
some favors right now especially
considering that we're we're overclocked
as much as we can be oh and that's a
whole group of people I'm about to okay
all right you know I was trying to make
a video guys and you just had to ruin it
not salty at all I guess we should move
on to the next game
prepare your defenses we're an overwatch
now I'm junk rat because it's the
easiest character to play when you're
not really playing we're playing at high
settings right now the high preset you
can see we're getting over 60 FPS right
now we were getting well over 60 almost
a hundred when we were in in smaller
places like more confined spaces
another we're out in the open and
there's a lot of a lot of things
happening on screen we're dipping to
around 60 but still very very playable
thank you mercy look at our GPU clock
speed it's very consistent just locked
into thirteen hundred and nineteen
megahertz still using about six and a
half gigs of system memory so again
you're gonna want more than eight CPU
usage still seems to be around thirty it
looks like we're using more CPU
definitely more CPU is is eaten up an
overwatch that it isn't fortnight almost
hitting fifty percent I would show you
the CPU temperatures but afterburner
doesn't actually read the CPU temps for
these drives and ap use right now at
least from from what I can tell there's
there's actually no option within
afterburner to bring up CPU temp on the
OSD but I can double-check for you
really quick okay 74 degrees C about the
same is what we were getting in
fortnight so definitely manageable
ok so clearly the system is overwatch
approved you are good to run overwatch
in 1920 by 1080 at high settings without
a doubt without a graphics card spam
spam spam oh I got junk ratted my junk
rat got junk ratted it's time to move on
all right we're playing doom and I hear
someone hey buddy you doing over here
I'll give you a hand so we're running it
with Vulcan right now the Vulkan API it
more optimized for AMD hardware than the
old opengl 4.5 so right now we're
hovering in the 40s in terms of frames
per second and that's pretty much where
we were in fortnight and the game is
just as smooth as fortnight was you can
see here
if I go into our settings that we are
running on the low preset so running at
low settings venturing somewhat into
console territory but the game still
looks great at 1920 by 1080 you can see
right there we are in windowed mode so
things look a little bit shrunken down
but all looks good and it's it's very
smooth again nothing earth-shattering
here guys but very very playable if if
you happen to be on a budget and can't
afford a graphics card it's kind of
surprising that we're actually eating up
less vram in this game than we were in
fortnight CPU usage is close to 50% and
we are using a bit more system memory
here at 7 gigs I'm not seeing any more
enemies guys I think I killed them all
so since there's no one to kill me I
guess I'll just voluntarily move on to
the next game but you know what I'm
gonna give doom a pass doom gets a solid
pass for being a very enjoyable at the
current settings hell yeah
get it because doom you're in hell here
we are in GTA 5 perusing the streets of
lo Santos 60 to 70 FPS in the city no
less actually getting turned on right
now let's let's take a look at our
settings we're a 1920 by 1080 and it
looks like ok msaa is off obviously you
guys know by now how much that tanks
performance in this title V sinks off
the fxaa is disabled pretty much rocking
like normal to bare minimum specs
so again nothing super eye candy
inducing but I don't know maybe it's
just because I'm in windowed mode it
still looks really good I'm just curious
I forget if this is one of those games
where performance matters if you're
windowed or fullscreen and apparently
not and obviously when you fullscreen on
a 32 inch 4k screen like this one things
don't look quite as nice but that being
said if I can D isn't your priority and
if you're ditching a discrete GPU
altogether it shouldn't be then GTA 5
very passable very playable stuff
throwing things at me I will kill you so
now we're we're getting as you guys
might assume even higher frame rates in
the sky because we're looking at clouds
and stuff that
that don't really need as much rendering
as the very dense big city here so oh no
crashing to that building no that's
never good
so things are looking pretty good so far
and I would say there's even Headroom
here to crank the settings up a bit so
wait how do you pull the oh yeah that's
right I tried this earlier and failed
miserably so let's see if I can do this
again you actually have to break this
isn't this isn't pub G or fortnight you
actually have to do an air brake let's
move on to the next game our last game
of the day is battlefield one let's take
a look at our settings here 1920 by 1080
vsync is off and we're running at the
low preset now I did try medium earlier
and performance was subpar was getting
into 30s and when you're in the 30s on
average it typically means that you're
dipping into the 20s here and there and
that's when things get really choppy
visibly so so I bump it down to low and
to be honest the the quality difference
isn't that much different perceptibly to
me anyway going from medium to low in
this game but it is a huge performance
impact going from low to medium so so
I'm gonna take low I'll take low any day
of the week for smoother gameplay are we
out here it looks like only five and a
half gigs of system memory at the moment
are being used eaten up 1.8 gigabytes of
vram 65 60 to 65 percentage CPU
utilization definitely a CPU heavy game
battlefield 1 ok but some of the things
up here I think it's definitely possible
to gain without a graphics card right
now if you have something like this rise
in APU with Vega graphics whether it be
a 2400 G or even the risin 320 200 G I
think you're good to go I mean obviously
there's a couple things to keep in mind
you want to have decent cooling
especially if you want to take full
advantage of this chip by overclocking
both the CPU and the GPU that's built in
pairing it with fast memory rising feeds
off of fast memory that's super
important and also don't get this case
because even if you're gonna game
without a discrete GPU for six months to
here you want to have the option to
eventually pop in a discrete card when
you're ready when you can afford it
once the prices come back down to a sane
and reasonable levels then you want to
have a case that actually has expansion
slots and can accommodate that discrete
video card because this one clearly does
not and finally you know I think you
have to be realistic when approaching
building a system like this like is this
rig gonna give you the smoothest
silkiest and most beautiful image and
gaming experience you've ever seen no
it's definitely not and far from it you
know but from from what I could tell
today it was definitely adequate it was
playable and it was comfortable and I
wasn't getting taken out of the game
from how low the performance was it was
definitely good enough and I think
anyone going in with those realistic
expectations building a system similarly
expect as this one is not going to be
disappointed but that's all I got for
now guys let me know what you think in
the comments below toss a like on the
video get subscribe for more tech stuff
coming at you really soon and you can
also check me out on floatplane if you
want to watch my videos a week early
without ads for 3 bucks a month I'll put
a link for that in the video description
til next time guys thank you so much for
tuning in have yourselves a good one and
I'll see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
