the battlefield one open beta kicked off
a day or two ago and despite the heavy
server issues that many folks and myself
were experiencing I managed to run some
benchmarks of the beta release using the
GTX 1066 gigabyte founders edition and
the reference RX 488 gigabyte model to
see how these mid-range cards are
handling the next installment in the
Battlefield franchise so far of course
being a pre-release version of the game
let's keep in mind that the performance
quality settings and pretty much
everything else you'll see today is
subject to change for the final release
today's findings are simply intended to
give us a hint at what we might expect
to find come the games october twenty
first debut starting with a quick look
at our in game video options the beta
actually has quite a few settings for us
to play around with including vsync
field of view motion blur weapon depth
of field and even options for colorblind
gamers in the advanced tab you'll find
the option to enable DirectX 12 which is
supported by battlefield 1 although it's
been known to be finicky with the open
beta and I for the life of me could not
get it to work properly with any of my
Direct X 12 frame rate monitoring
software so you'll just have to deal
with my crummy directx11 benchmarks
until the games full release apart from
resolution scaling and UI scale factor
adjustment the beta also has some
familiar graphical settings ranging from
low to ultra as well as a custom option
for fine-tuning your experience for our
testing I enabled the ultra preset of
course and ran both cards overclocked
giving the GTX 1060 a 230 megahertz
offset on the core clock and a four
percent boost on the RX 480 in AMD what
men the cards ran the game at 1080 1440
and 4k and while there's little sense in
using these cards to play triple-a
titles that ultra HD this was done more
for direct comparison purposes than for
practicality so with that said here's
our single benchmark slide showing the
results from today's tests the data
shows the GTX 1060 as a top performer at
all three resolutions pulling more and
more ahead of the RX 480 as we increase
the pixel count as expected 1080 gamers
with either card will likely experience
some very nice frame rates in
battlefield 1 however during my test the
game ate up three point two gigs of vram
at 1080p so if you're looking to play
this game with the GTX 1060 I would opt
for the 60 gigabytes variant for the
best results that should also be more
than enough to service the game at 1440p
where a memory maxed out at around three
point six gigs
AMD users probably won't have to worry
about this so much as even the cheaper
for gigabyte our X 480 appears to have a
large enough frame buffer at higher
resolutions with that said only the GTX
1060 was able to top the 60 FPS
threshold at 1440 while yielding
seventeen percent more frames on average
than Team Red the RX 480 held its own
though meaning GTX 970 and r9 390 users
should also have no issues running the
game with similar settings at quad HD
especially if overclocking finally at 4k
I wanted to mention that the maximum
gddr5 usage hit 4.4 gigs so neither card
was really crippled so much in terms of
vram as they were in raw speed and
performance again guys these are not
necessarily the exact results we're
going to see on launch day but at the
same time I don't think they're too far
off since they do fall in line with
previous directx11 benchmarks we've seen
from these two cards that is to say the
GTX 1066 gigabyte model will likely be
the faster card for battlefield one with
the RX 480 being the slower but adequate
and more affordable option but that's
gonna do it for now guys let me know in
the comments if you think today's
results are indicative at all of the
performance will see on launch day and
how you've been liking the battlefield 1
beta so far assuming you've been able to
penetrate those EA servers ha I said
penetrate as always thank you guys for
watching subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and I'll see y'all in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
