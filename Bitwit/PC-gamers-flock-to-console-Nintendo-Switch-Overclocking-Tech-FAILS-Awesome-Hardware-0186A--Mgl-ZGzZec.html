this type of thing happens all the time
I'm sure oh you have a join button I
should I should finish I should know the
membership thing so I could I can get a
joint I have no idea how many people are
actually subscribed I may be it and then
I I haven't really checked this table
probably says her life okay yeah there
we go see all right that's more like it
everything else perfect that's a good
sign okay all right
can we start yeah yeah words we're
started it has it has begun has begun
now this meme is waiting on me alright
welcome welcome welcome come one come
all
hear ye hear ye this be the awesome
hardware livestream like a town wait
that was a town crier ending right into
a pirate yeah
we're all about matchups here we promote
diversity when we can thank you for
being here this is awesome hardware some
186 side a and about a half an hour or
so will switch over to side B on Paul's
channel usually do a column slash Paul's
hardware and yeah we do this every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware and of course our
respective YouTube channels thank you
for being here we occasionally talk
about news and important things and
cover things of interest and technology
but yeah usually technology related but
more frequently we easily more
frequently will drink a couple beers on
stream as well
beers cheese to all of you at home juice
thank you or at work a lot of people
watch this from work we're very very
diverse we're we're very palatable like
that you can watch us anywhere Cal has a
new glass he's selling in his store yeah
yeah I am I'd buy my new GN glasses the
new gamers Nexus glass stands for God
Kyle's don't buy the gamers Nexus glass
from the gamers next to store buy from
Kyle store yes you will definitely find
all kinds of gamers in Texas merchandise
on my store
speaking of stores my store is big with
tech let's segue Billy Joe Jack thank
you Paul for that beautiful alley-oop
at that time
stream deck worked oh yeah if we're late
today it's because if the stream is hit
sure blame blame Elgato kinda blame
blame Corsair but this is my store you
can see we still have the screw with
confidence shirts they've been flying
off the shelves oh yeah I already have
to restock the first batch because you
guys are just buying them up so if you
already bought one thank you feel free
to buy five more you haven't bought one
yet where are you wearing one what yeah
Paul is wearing one right now in in
classic Paul fashion looks really good
name on you Paul thank you so comfy
comfy you see I'm saying seem really
quality this is my nipples a little bit
oh yeah well that's how else are you
gonna you know turn on the ladies which
is probably like a beacon obsessing the
logo on there screw with confidence
exactly it all goes hand in hand Paul
also has his store Paul's hardware net
you can pick up the new captive
thumbscrews short or a selective
merchandise ranges from pint glasses to
shirts and hoodies and bottle openers
that we're using today and everything is
very high-quality fun things we will
yell John stitches at the end of the
show if you happen to pick up anything
from either of our stores and if you get
anything that's awesome hardware
merchandise related then you basically
get double Johnson's no you don't you
don't get double Johnson's for picking
up that we split the profits evenly we
split the profits evilly regardless of
which site you buy it off of so you
don't have to you don't have to be
burdened with the task of choosing
alright I think that's pretty much it
for we don't have any other
announcements right it's funny cuz you
have subtitles going on on your video
there yeah and I'm watching it like live
transcribe what we're saying which is
which is 95 percent accurate impressive
how accurate is and and stumble when
it's and when it's not yeah did you get
double oh they double double Judds and
double Jetson double Judson if you guys
want just like an extra entertainment
factor turn on subtitles because we're
not interesting enough it's pretty fun
alright so we can move on to some tech
news here I actually have quite a few
stories today but they're most of them
are pretty short so we'll get through
them relatively quick all right the
first one is from actually it's not an
article it's just posting it's a listing
from Newegg this is the AMD rise instead
2700 X AMD 50 gold additions to
celebrate their 50th year anniversary
gold its old baby for three hundred and
twenty nine US dollars compared to two
hundred and ninety five for the non
special boring to 2700 X but where's the
fun of that
so obviously you got to pay that extra
thirty five bucks to get a gold box you
get a gold box you get a wraith prism
waiting for them of that real rhythm
cooler and the CPU itself has some
itching into it I don't know these
edging buds leases it's a signature it's
a ciggy right they did the photo team a
new egg really did a number on this one
they took one oh you gotta give him
credit yeah that RMD sent them these
pictures but I don't know it looks like
typical you egg you come now hog Rafi
Forge Lisa Sue's Tex right check yes
you're anywhere just transcribed that
yeah I mean you can just do that
straight from the new excite you don't
about to buy the processor that's true
yeah exactly
it's free plagiarism and let you get a
badge a certificate yeah there's a nice
little which also has Lisa's signature
right just to make it even more clear
how to plagiarize okay
her cig and yeah there's no performance
uplift with these chips as far as we can
tell if it is it's not advertised we're
like oh they must have been demand give
them made these better would have been
nice like no they're just just kind of
itching it's for those you know those
guys are going to some gold on the box
yeah you know there's a 30 year I'm
sorry 50 50 year anniversary there's
usually no practical reason to collect
to be a collector of things unless
you're like selling it back for lots of
money it's usually a hobby cause you
always have to be about money doesn't
doesn't have to be no it doesn't
necessarily to be about money sometimes
it could be added functionality or
performance like if there was if these
offer if these were Bend then there
might be a more practical reason to buy
to spend more money on something like
maybe there's a select group of people
out there who buy every single AMD
processor that they've ever come out
with and now this will be another one
that they need to add to the collection
mahat hundred percent completion that's
important but once they make a
commitment for that you have to stick
with it I'm not knocking 100% completion
I'm just saying that it's impractical
especially if it's more costly than you
know 95 impractical you're you're you
straight from a completionists mouth so
now I give up I gave a completion ISM I
don't hate collectors let the record
state do I collect anything currently
collect I collect viewers who collect in
that everyday I really collect anything
I'm probably a boring person I don't you
add some depth to your character and
start collecting some shit like what
would you collect if you were a
collector because you don't collect
anything either right if you collected
something what do you think there's
first thing pokemon cards you know those
pop figurines
I have games I do have a coin collection
like an old old coin collection okay I
think it is like there was like a year
that I collected coins sometime long ago
but I still have them I bet they're
worth a lot of money I have some comic
books okay you know yeah some of those
that's in the cards the comic book
trading cards that quantify each heroes
statistics as far as how powerful they
are and stuff that's super nerdy those
are those are really helpful right but
see comic book collecting is make sense
to me because you know you can like
there's it's a form of entertainment you
get joy out of reading and beginners you
can't read the commentaries just you
have to be in Pristina in video take it
out of the packaging and touch it then
that immediately reduces the value and
and that you can't have that oh so it is
all about money for you what you
knocking me for mentioning money and now
all of a sudden well I can't it's it's
not money it's mint and it's and if it's
not mint it's bullshit and so like why
would you want something that's not mint
condition and if you take it out of the
packaging then it's not mint anymore yes
the value goes down so that's part of it
but it's an it's more about again that
had a percent completion and thing now
you have to have everything and they
have to be perfect right untouched brand
sullied by the world
a nice game of Thrones reference there
Hey the unsullied they were they were
important they fought hard um no yeah
but the yeah it's the same thing like I
used to have polka Mon cars I used to
collect it when I was younger and stuff
and you know something like oh if it's
if it's like an untouched
you know mint Edition first first
edition chars are it's worth like I
should ton of money you know when I was
that young I didn't care about keeping
it fresh for the money for the value I
just liked a really clean card
it was just pristine and I just got a
hard-on for how frickin perfect it was
so again it goes back to my statement my
argument which is valid which is a
collection as collecting is not often
practical it was about the money it
would be more practical but no it's
nothing practical about keeping
something super fresh that's all just a
weird internal hard I think that the
catalyst I think the term practical is
subjective because I would I could argue
that if somebody derives joy from
something like that then it is practical
who are you to shit on someone else's
joy that's
hmm I will shit off that I'll shit on
everyone so you let people collect their
it's their stupid comic books and their
their their other stuff that they
collect all right we got it read the
author I'm the author on what is what's
enjoyable
alright tangent okay how do we do that
we managed to turn this really short
story into something lengthy it's
growing all right let's not the
contradicting how you say this is a bad
for showing so we have our next topic
here about an analyst
it's an analyst group called John petty
research JP JP are they're pretty well
known yeah and they make some bold
claims here that in about three years
over the next three years roughly 20
million PC gamers are gonna be switching
to TV gaming platforms and this is gonna
coincide with the declining PC platform
and it's waning popularity according to
them which I don't think is true and
they're saying that this is gonna affect
mostly low end users and what what they
mean by low end users is
stupid people stupid people mainly
people that have obviously you'd have to
be of low intelligence to be alumni
great to an inferior platform that's
alright I have an immediate question
okay as far as how they're quantifying
yeah whatever they're basing this on TV
gaming platforms a PC game on the TV all
the time I have a gaming PC that's
connected to the television in the
living room I have wireless controllers
for it I can use it in a very similar
fashion to a console sure does that
count
I don't think that counts are they
talking about PC gamers who are just
plugging their PC into a flat-screen
television they should have clarified
are they including are they assuming
that Nvidia is gonna go crazy selling
their big fucking gaming displays or
whatever the game if jeez
yeah the BFGS know maybe that's part of
this is that or no this is all just I
phone that all I'm out of my ass by the
way it's based on nothing yeah I think
what they mean is you know gaming
consoles or gaming platforms that are
more commonly hooked up to a TV I mean
yes people do connect their PCs to TVs
to game but it's not quite as common as
people who do the same thing with
consoles I think there meaning that most
PC gamers or 20 millions of PC gamers
are gonna switch to non-pc alternatives
for their gaming their primary gaming
platform and they're saying mostly low
end users meaning people who have builds
under $1000 of value which if you look
at the statistics is the majority of PC
gamers anyone most PC gamers have
systems that were built for under about
under $1000
so they're saying again these are pretty
bold claims and the reason why they're
saying this is that you know they're
saying that there's this is a result of
improvements to TV displays console
performance is increasing and becoming
more like a PC than ever before and
there's also the idea of console
exclusive titles that are super
appealing now they also say that the the
the technology in piece
is slowing down we're seeing slow slowed
down to tech advances on the PC side
performance gains are becoming few and
far between and you know they're more
incremental improvements and performance
and they're taking longer to achieve
which there might be some truth to that
but there's a lot of other things
they're overlooking as well for example
having technical changes be so far apart
also decreases the the price of a PC
gaming hardware on PC hardware becomes
cheaper if if the time between big
launches gets further apart and so it
becomes more more approachable there's a
lower barrier to entry in that same
sense there's also all of these other
factors all these benefits of of having
a PC that the report ignores like the
freedom to choose whatever Hardware you
want having custom peripherals open
storefronts different mod support for
for games work usage the fact that you
can multitask with a PC whereas it's a
bit more difficult on a console and the
list kind of goes on here so it seems
like a very short-sighted report even
though as you mentioned this is a
well-known well-known analyst jpr has
been around for a while and a lot of
people take their reports seriously and
they seem legitimate but it is this one
conflicts with what I believe herrmann
notions have been what we believe yes so
it must be wrong garbage it must be
wrong and I just find it hard to believe
that they're saying they're claiming
that hundreds of millions will flock to
TV gaming in the next five years I don't
think that's gonna happen I think just
like having better graphics there's
gonna be that group of people who who
want a game with the best and I feel
like it's easier to do that as PC
hardware gets cheaper you don't need to
spend $3,000 on a gaming PC to achieve
that you get unlocked frame rates which
is fantastic and you can do that with a
mid-range system and the keyboard and
mouse interface
I mean unless unless console can really
add start adding full-blown support to
all their games the triple-a titles for
keyboard and mouse I just don't see it
happening because and even if going back
to your example of what if they mean if
you know are they leaving out the fact
that some people connect pcs to their
TVs I still don't think there's a really
good solution for gaming on a PC in the
living room because the keyboard and
mouse thing like I feel like you need a
desk to use a keyboard mouse effectively
I've used the Corsair lapdog and stuff
in the past and other other alternatives
and it's just not quite as comfortable I
need like that extra lumbar support that
the office chair offers in order to feel
like I really have you know good
ergonomics when when gaming on a PC so I
don't know I think this is a pretty
pretty far-fetched claim and this report
seems like it doesn't have a lot of
weight to it there are certain truths
certain truths here that they point out
you know of you know performance gains
just being very incremental over the
years over the last few years but I
still think it's a bunch of bollocks PC
glory forever also like just like
content creators pushing things forward
as you know we're living in the age of
the internet like twitch streamers think
about all the twitch streamers that are
gamers which is the vast majority of
twitch streamers they're mostly on PC
and I feel like a lot of them get you
know sponsorship branded deals with
digital storm and cyber power or
whatever EK and stuff and they're
advertising PC gaming in a sense to all
their followers and I feel like PC is
still like the holy grail of gaming
platforms I feel like that's still the
general consensus for most people I mean
correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like
that's still what everyone strives to to
get to is PC PC master-race but I don't
know I think it's I think it's stupid
all right be clearly clear you have many
many thoughts brewing in that mind of
yours Paul I'm just waiting to unload
them right now and drop some knowledge
on us I'd be curious as to how they came
to these conclusions yeah it seems like
there's a lot of speculation go
so I have a point to like if you're
talking about gaming in the living room
gaming on the living room TV those are
becoming more and more often 4k TVs and
if you're gonna push 4k yes some of the
consoles can do it but if you're gonna
do it and have actual good like textures
and be able to turn settings up and
everything yeah you kind of need it for
that yeah all right stupid article I'm
pretty stupid now dumb jpr screw you
guys let's move on to our next article
from hexxus sinden this is the sinden
light gun for Windows it's a IndieGoGo
urn I'm sorry Kickstarter campaign that
is basically a light gun it's playing
duck hunt you remember duck hunt right
honey yes you ever played duck hunt josh
josh is playing duck hunt the fractal
Josh yeah hey not all redheads look the
same okay you just be good he's a ginger
doesn't mean they're very similar
haircut and facial structure as well
besides being a ginger and that's
exactly how josh holds a gun it is he's
very he has a very good name so he's
very casual about it
those are his jeans too and his couch
yeah he loves those pillows um so all
right this this is crazy they had a 32
thousand dollar goal that's so loud they
blew past the thirty two thousand dollar
goal they're at about one what are they
at look at their Kickstarter page now
they were at like 185 when I last
checked $185,000 and now they're
probably at what 201 190 195 I think
it's the raised over yeah 180 686 there
are 186 thousand dollars well past their
goal of 32 grand and they still have two
weeks to go these guys are gonna be like
they're probably gonna raise 300 400
maybe even half a million dollars for
this friggin light gun who knew there
was such a demand for this thing and it
makes sense in a way because light guns
have been great in the past for CRT
monitors they just work really well for
those but when you're talking about
using a light gun on an LCD display you
typically have to introduce sensors into
the mix which is why and that introduces
a lot of lag which is why the
like guns that we've seen in the past
from guys like PlayStation and even
though we you did not work very well
they were just kind of garbage and and
the lag was too extreme to overcome
those challenges so this is a different
type of light gun where it doesn't have
a sensor whatsoever there's no sensor
bar that you need to sync up because it
has a high-speed camera built-in as law
as well as they know I'm sorry it has a
high-speed camera built-in that
recognizes the rectangular border of
your TV or monitor which is why - you
know TLDR it doesn't actually need a
dedicated sensor which reduces the
amount of lag significantly it also has
its own dedicated CPU which means
there's no calibration needed like other
light guns and it can add 3d user
movement and supported games it's fully
window supported fully windows supported
so that's cool you can PC game and maybe
download you know install some emulators
get some emulators going play play games
like time crisis or House of the Dead
time crisis is fun yeah super fun and
you know you can see this being like a
great party accessory like a party game
accessory is having a couple light guns
in the house yeah bust them out when
you're you know their own a little fun
party with some friends it's a cool
little party tool and this is also gonna
feature eight buttons that are
programmable I should say for the for
the eight buttons are programmable you
reload with a pump there's a little
physical pump that you can you can pump
action sorry that's immersive very
immersive yeah yeah VR is looking dated
in comparison and it's also it's also
gonna support Linux at some point
they're saying that the linux support is
experimental at this point so but i
think most people are probably be using
this for Windows
it can be used with like raspbian which
is the one of the main Raspberry Pi os's
so you could actually turn a Raspberry
Pi into like a retro arcade shooter type
of PC which is pretty cool I'm sure
they're gonna be some cool applications
for this if you wanted to get one of
these bad boys you have to pay you have
to pay 80 great British pounds GBP to
USD
is $104 Wow roughly a hundred and four
bucks for this gaming accessory which
will be worth it more to some than
others or you can pay a hundred and
thirty great British pounds for the
recoil version which I would imagine has
some sort of simulated and blowback or
kickback on on the actual gun which is
pretty cool
supported games include like I mentioned
ten crisis one two and three House of
House of the Dead one two three four and
overkill duck hunt point-blank one two
and three Terminator 2 arcade Star Wars
trilogy Jurassic Park the lost world
area 51 and many many more cool I think
it's fun it looks fun I think it's fun
it it kind of brings you back to that
arcade style of gaming yeah that
two-player or or you can yeah
dual wield right oh yeah totally double
fisting right there
so um guns very very cool if you guys
are interested maybe you know I always
hate recommending kick starters or any
kind of crowdfunding campaign because
you never know if you're gonna get what
they promised which is why you've got
guys like you know Linus tech tips
making entire series web series like
kick farter home that that shows off how
campaign crowdfunding campaigns can go
south I think it's kick farted kick
farted sorry feel bad that I know that
and for correcting you but I did it
anyway ah so that's fun
yeah that's super fun someone someone
back it and and when you get it let us
know if we made the right choice of him
not funding it let's move on though to
this article from over call three you
know net about AMD's latest game bundle
that you should all be aware of in case
you're looking to buy a new GPU mhm and
in particular this is celebrating their
50th year anniversary that we mentioned
earlier so it's a very special game
bundle very celebratory and it
essentially ships with anyone who's
purchasing a Rison or chips with horizon
5 or rising 7 mm serious CPU so a 2nd
gen rising
or you could get an Rx 570 or RX 5 maybe
or higher and this game bundle will also
be eligible for those GPUs as well
what's the game's whether the games
include the division to Gold Edition
which I think includes some like DLC and
stuff like that that you'd always have
to pay extra for and World War Z which
I'm not too familiar with I've heard of
it but I haven't I don't know if it's a
good game or not or what the gameplay is
like but you get to pretty Triple A
games sounds like a math game and a
spelling game World War Z yeah right and
the division to war for Z from the
creator's who brought you Resident Evil
and Sesame Street comes in it's like you
got to spell the words quickly to letter
R in order to survive the zombie
apocalypse
so uh this is basically this article
just goes on to say like you know to
reiterate the fact that the rx 570 for
example is such a better deal a much
better deal right now than the GTX 1650
that was recently launched from Nvidia
because it's not only cheaper but it's
faster as well in the majority of titles
and you know that's it's you can buy an
rx 574 much lower than its original MSRP
mainly because it's been out for so long
which also goes to show the gtx 1650 is
is kind of it's it's like two years
behind with its performance and nvidia
seems to be out of their mind charging
the price that they are at 150 USD it's
very weird it's so bizarre I don't know
is that just a high horse that they're
on really like I I don't know you can do
it people still buy it are they in that
mentality now is that where they are
people buy it because it's possible buy
it because they want they'll buy in
video because I think your videos the
best I'm sure this I'm sure that that
applies to some degree I'm sure I'm sure
that pitch was made at some point when
they were discussing position you know
market positioning for this product and
stuff right but I don't think that's a
good thing to ride on you know a short
for PC gamers I think
very anti clean pretty much more savvy
when it comes to actual performance of
prints and researching stuff before they
buy and everything I mean that's why we
do what we do not that not that we're
super awesome at it but we do our best
point being we are the best
16:50 launch surprising surprising it
was that they they saw coming
how how poor the reception was going to
be and they were still just like now
just push it out just hold back the
driver so no verviers can review it yeah
watch this it's like they even admitted
like by doing that they even admitted
that they knew it was gonna be a bad
launch and that was a bad product that's
just it's weird
yeah anyway so it goes by don't buy 16
fifty four hundred and fifty dollars buy
you can get eight gig 570s I've seen
some eight gig five babies for four how
not much more yeah maybe 160 yeah hardly
more than a GTX sixteen fifty so it
really puts it in a difficult position
to to vouch for but let's move on to our
next article from overclocked 3d once
again this is about the Nintendo switch
gaming CPU overclocking support what but
this is maybe not exactly what you might
have thought so this is in reference to
the latest update to the Nintendo switch
that actually gives a boost mode to the
onboard Tegra x1 SOC from 1.0 2-0
gigahertz to 1.75 gigahertz that's
nearly a 75% boost
pretty darn handy there but this is
unfortunately not for continuous use on
the Nintendo switch rather it is a boost
mode that temporarily kicks in when
you're loading games it's to speed up
load times so this guy was a testing app
testing out Legend of Zelda breath of
the wild and found that after the update
eleven point something seconds point
three 111 some seconds to load for 65
seconds of your life
hey every time you load up a Zelda game
if you line this up hundreds of times a
week or month you know but
that's up and it definitely adds up so
it's kind of cool that we're getting
these uh I guess CPU overclock straight
from software updates although it's not
that's that Zelda it shrine sorry okay
look Zelda sorry yeah I thought I'll do
it - no I thought is Legend of Zelda
breath of the wild that's loading okay
so it's presently just seen ferment
shrine loading - shrines probably been
maybe a location yeah you're sorry I
haven't played breath of the while
neither about I do really like Zelda
games I just haven't played any of the
newer ones
yeah same I don't think I've ever played
a Zelda game all the way through just
very sad really
yeah not even the old ones don't tell
anyone I said that no I never have cuz I
never I think I was just I never got
around to playing Legend of Zelda on NES
it it didn't even enter my atmosphere
like it just wasn't on my radar and then
I never had an SNES and when I got n64 I
don't know I just for some reason Legend
of Zelda never hung out with the wrong
crowd you did bad influences yeah
obviously yeah it's horrible they're
buying like perfect dark yeah I've heard
so many positive things about breath of
the wilds yeah it's definitely something
I would be playing if I felt like I had
time to play video games
yeah or more than the shirt that's
that's what's happened to me is like I
know I have so much less time to play
video games now so I'm drawn more to the
the shirt episodic like like overwatch I
like yeah play a couple of games of only
watch and then stop playing right you
know it's not like the games that are
longer that have a story mm-hmm like you
play for a couple hours and then you
can't play for like a week or two yeah
then you come back and like what where
am I going on exactly in this game yeah
sucks
I need bite-sized gaming experiences
it's very sad yeah I don't think so
fully I'll get a chance to try it at
some point yeah so um sorry if anyone
thought that they were gonna be able to
like liquid cooler switch and get crazy
performance in the game and up the FPS
which is probably locked anyway
yeah that's not exactly what it is but
it's still kind of cool that
to know to know that the sort of update
is possible might be applicable in
future generations of consul I let's
move on to our last article for this
segment of tech news which is from Ars
Technica referencing a TV that samsung
has made specifically for Millennials Oh
which is really weird kind of a specific
demo but this is a 43 inch zero or cero
ser Oh Sarah I don't know how to
pronounce it that's what the model name
is zero the 43 inch 0 goes landscape or
portrait mode hey why would you ever
want a TV a 43 inch TV to go portrait
mode you ask well as the increasing
number of Millennials continue to view
mobile content on their mobile devices
maybe some of those Millennials will
also want to see that same content on a
large screen so there is built-in NFC
technology into the 0 that that comes
equipped with a very simple and easy to
use mirroring function so you can
actually mirror what's on your phone on
to this 43 inch vertical TV so yeah if
you're watching Instagram TV for example
which is shot in portrait mode and
displayed in portrait mode or you happen
to be on is it really yes god yeah
it's all vertical and it's very
disturbing uh it just I don't like it I
wanted it rubs me the wrong way
it's exactly right it does it's quite
traumatizing and then you also have well
that's it
it's just it's a TV that goes vertical
nothing else special nothing special
they made a stand that can rotate watch
your tick-tock videos the way they were
intended to be on a large screen in your
living room no that's not it's not at
all
maybe mobile content most of our content
is so shitty it's maybe it's meant to be
on a 5 inch screen and no larger than
that you ever think about that and also
so the author of the article brings up a
good point you know the reason why
vertical video exists in the first place
is because people are too damn lazy and
can't be
bothered to rotate their five inch
screens 90 degrees why the hell are they
gonna do it with a 43 inch TV very good
point
damn good point don't worry it's only
one point eight nine million one Korean
one which equates to about $1,600 u.s.
that's X I left updated pressure in the
original article said it was sixteen
thousand dollars but sixteen thousand
dollars yeah oh yeah but then they
updated it I only read the update to
because I felt ya 18.9 million one is
the Google Translate bug it's one point
eight nine million won or sixteen
hundred dollars and this is all gonna be
a Korea launched South Korean launch so
you have to worry about getting annoyed
by it in the US or anywhere else let's
move on you can still get annoyed by it
even if you're not in Korea that's true
it's not as in your face perhaps all
right let's move on to our next segment
here which is text Bailes
oh I forgot to give you the damn you
didn't forget you son of a bitch you
made it can we do it impromptu maybe I
can do a song and dance quick enough for
you to for you to load that up
so you see here kids the segment tech
fails focuses on technology whether it
be Hardware concepts or ideas practices
that have in some way or another Vale
where'd you put it
oh crap I forgot to put on the USB never
ever forget it damn it
I spent time on it too it was so cool
it's actually really terrible lower
thirds I say this in the desktop son of
a bitch all right we should make
everyone wait at least another minute so
we just so they can see that we can no
no and they see it they'll be like it
was not worth it at all let's talk about
our first tech fails article here it's
actually not an article it's actually a
YouTube video my friend our one really
friend J's two cents Oh J all right so
it's titled this PC wouldn't boot you'll
never guess why and it all stems from a
huge tech fail that being the SSD the
HyperX fury RGB
two-and-a-half inch SSD that got so hot
that overheated so badly due to the 75
RGB LEDs that are in it that it actually
malfunctioned and prevented Windows from
booting
so he actually has a thermal camera on
here this is as soon as he turns the
LEDs on the SSD again 75 LEDs why would
you even cram that many that much
lighting onto such a small device you
can see that the temperature is rising
this is in real - okay almost real-time
its 115 X 15 times faster than real time
which is definitely not real time but
the fact that this is still increasing
well beyond its idle temps without the
LEDs on of like he wasn't doing anything
with with it there either no he wasn't
even doing anything
it was completely idle is this is just
the LEDs heating up the drive so I went
from 30 C to around 70 C more than
doubled the temperature more than
doubled just from having the LEDs on at
idle the the SSD wasn't doing anything
and it was still getting so hot it could
not function properly it's insane
he even had a case fan at one point he
tried aiming a case fan directly on to
the drive to see if that would help
thermal throttling mm-hmm it did very
minimal it basically did nothing it was
not very effective whatsoever so not
even good cooling proper cooling in a
case could help this situation now this
is probably the controller that's
overheating the actual controller rest
as opposed to the individual man chips
because man tends to do a lot better
under under heat when it's when it's
warmed up then controllers do of course
there is a maximum point where that all
falls to shit and NAND will will
overheat but it has a much higher heat
tolerance than controllers do so I would
speculate that it's really the
controller that was uh that was getting
too hot because the LEDs I didn't watch
this whole video does he really try to
put a water cooler on it at the end I
don't think he'd put a water cooler on
it it's got an AI oh he's trying to
attach to a plate I don't member seeing
this part so I clearly didn't watch the
whole thing
I mean it's a J video you know it's J
doing this thing I'm sure it's great
it's a great video solid content but you
know I'm gonna watch the whole thing
it's it's at least 10 minutes and one
second it's a lot of time effective I
don't know but but yeah it's good video
guys check it out
you know what's interesting is that the
white LED got it hottest the quickest
like when you switch it over to a
different color like red or blue it
didn't actually get as hot or it would
take a lot longer to heat up that mixed
where it was with the white that makes
perfect sense
oh yeah I guess it does because all the
colors are maxed out right and so all
the only DS are at full because white is
all usually about usually an RGB has
three three small LEDs right a red a
green and a blue and if you put them all
at max brightness that's what's white
yeah I guess that makes sense I think
about that so I guess this is all to say
that if you're gonna buy a HyperX fury
re GB SSD don't unless you're ok with
disabling the SS don't you don't you get
the RGB one do they have a non RGB
version of the fury yeah okay there you
go
there you go that's obviously it if you
like the drive itself the way it looks
does it seem really necessary it's
purely an aesthetic movement so first
tech fail of the day Thank You J for
shading light on that let's all and he
got on trending on that one by the way
he was on forty number 45 on YouTube
trending no video so congrats J good job
Jay yeah it's looking good let's move on
to our second tech fail of the day which
is from is an article from iFixit and
they're briefly talking about how or why
the Samsung Galaxy fold has been failing
as hard as it has been have you seen any
of the sort of videos on the Galaxy fold
or why people are so a couple
underwhelmed by it here and there there
have been many people many different
reviewers who have taken a first look
and just found it and it's all been
unanimously bad press this thing has
just gotten creamed one way or another
for various reasons and so I fix it
being the fix-it pros or pair pros that
they are take another look and are
speculating in this article as to why
it's doing such a bad job
the first thing they say is that you
know they give ol Ed's credit because is
using an OLED screen of course Oh LEDs
are the only type of screen right now
that can really fold in this manner
especially due to the fact that they
don't have a backlight that LCD panels
are usually fitted with or stuck with
but they're also a lot more delicate and
just overall fragile than LS LS D LCDs
different story which which means that
they're prone to complete failure as
opposed to more localized damage with an
LCD you might have some dead pixels in
one area but the rest of the screen
works perfectly fine whereas an OLED is
much more prone to just you know kicking
the bucket entirely if any one little
thing goes wrong so there are a lot more
fragile even though they're more
foldable a better term so even a small
crap in a crap while my words are words
or words or words even a small crack in
in the encapsulation layer that that
surrounds the OLED layer can permanently
damage organic materials inside the
display and this is because o LEDs are
highly sensitive to things like oxygen
and moisture which is why it's so
surprising that several of the reviewers
reviewers found I guess lack of a better
term like backdoors or just open cracks
in the phone either behind the fold like
behind the actual spine of the phone and
in the other hinge area these are
actually open areas gaps in the phone
that would allow dust and other
particles and other little tiny objects
like sand grains of sand and stuff to
actually get up in there in the phone
and under the OLED screen the hits and I
hate sand to read it's everywhere that's
why I never go to the beach because I my
phone is too important to me but it's
even more of an issue here with with
this this foldable display since it has
so many gaps in it and there's even like
so imagine you know the phone opens kind
of like a book and there's a display on
either side and those decisions a fixed
to the phone itself but the spine the
middle of that screen isn't really fixed
to anything it has to be loose it has to
be able to flex so that the phone can
bend
and open and close and so that that
loose flex area of the spine means that
the OLED screen could potentially press
against objects that got stuck inside of
the phone in that area which is why
several the reviewers actually saw over
time that there were like little bumps
in the screen almost like just little
like little things that were like
protruding trying to like break through
the screen like just little bumps
because that's actually a perfect
picture because there's maybe a grain of
sand in there or something like that or
some dirt or dust or debris that is
really just being pressed up against
this very thin and fragile display so
there's also another thing with the
screen there's like a screen protector
apparently what looks to be a
pre-installed screen protector marques
Brownlee mkbhd did of course sort of a
first impressions look he thought it was
a screen protector that was
pre-installed so when he tried to peel
it off
he realized oh this is not a screen
protector it is actually a vital part of
the phone and removing it or attempting
to remove it will potentially
permanently damage your phone and his
actually blacked out so taking off the
screen protector actually caused his
phone to black out completely and he had
to get sent a completely new unit in
order to continue his initial review you
might also have to start over a
replacement yes yes exactly so this is
just you know trying to take it off
would would just potentially apply too
much pressure on the underlying surface
which would kill the OLED and there's
just a bunch of other there's a laundry
list of issues here so that's why
they've delayed the lunch which is why
they've delayed the launch and good call
rightfully so maybe they'll come back
even stronger I hope they do otherwise
this this phone is screwed let's talk
about other phones that have been
royally screwed lately including this
one from energizer or the energizer big
battery p18 kpop smartphone that we've
talked about several times on the show
and it was known for having a ridiculous
18,000 milliamp battery but also being
as a consequence thick more than three
times thicker than most
smartphones thick and significantly
heavier thick bone making it difficult
to fit in even larger pockets for most
people this was designed by the company
a venir I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing
that right and a veneer who license the
energy or the energizer and brand name
with hopes of mass production it's
almost like a Veck seer but and of X
here I've been here that's that's why it
sounded familiar yeah good let's do two
observation Paul so they actually put
the P 18k pop on IndieGoGo with an early
bird price of 549 us and I had a goal
there are 1.2 million dollars they're
really shooting for the stars there they
ended up with 15,000 just over $15,000
so I'm quite the opposite success story
that our light gun had it has been
having we mentioned earlier this no
that's not a lot of money they fell 99%
short of their goal why maybe they are
listening too much because I've heard a
lot of people say like for for the phone
manufacturers who were eternally seeking
the thinnest possible phone they can
design and a lot of people are like it
doesn't have to be like paper thin it
doesn't have to be super super super
thin sure I'm okay with it being a
little bit thicker if that means it's a
little bit more durable or as more
battery life or something like that but
not this that's too much this is this is
taking us as this harkens back to like
the 1990s yeah that's that's Rick phones
that's fairly absurd no one's gonna buy
and so and no one did buy it because it
never became a thing because there have
enough funding right because what anyone
can do is there's there's power bricks
that you can get that are this size that
have the same amount of power in them
and you can get whatever phone you want
and just plug it into that when you need
it not necessarily have to be holding
that thing up anytime you want to use
your phone exactly so um so long mr.
Popple it was nice knowing you and then
finally we have number one on trending
YouTube on YouTube trending right now
this is the number one video in the
world on YouTube it is the Sonic the
Hedgehog live-action series do if the
disclaimer or a warning official trailer
yeah the warning is that play the whole
thing don't it's not worth playing the
whole
you guys can just watch it I think I put
it in the description yeah but look at
that like to dislike ratio hundred and
eighty three thousand dislikes and 125
thousand like I mean it's it's it's
getting views like in like crazy it's
seven seven point two million views
already but when you look at just how
they've done this and just like the
artwork the stylized really it's onyx
onyx face looks messed up and they then
they play gangster's paradise which
doesn't make any that is like a brief
cut in the in the clip but it's like the
main song they keep playing it's just a
bunch of white dudes and sonic
gangster's paradise I don't understand
Jim Carrey's in this movie
he plays dr. Robotnik dr. Robotnik yet
is it yeah which is I think you know it
makeup the mustache down but isn't dr.
Robotnik's supposed to be fat yeah I
feel like it's the very end there's a
shot where you know he must go through
some transformative thing that happens
okay where he looks more like doctor
maybe this is the extent of the trailer
and I only saw just the short version
but I think you know Jim Carrey is great
I love Jim Carrey this is the pressure
but I also just don't believe in this
film
look at how creepy he looks he looks
like Michael Jackson look at his nose he
looks like he's had plastic surgery on
his nose he's got a creepy human smile
yeah right and the voice actor is Ben
Schwartz which which is I like him as an
actor he's cool but I just I'm not
seeing it I didn't laugh once and in the
trailer even though even in the funny
parts there's no I'm not showing this
anymore
no no don't show it anymore okay I don't
know I feel like this is a movie that
you watch because you want to do a react
video to it yeah you know because it's
so cringy that that's it's only
redeeming value not that it's gonna win
some Oscars or anything yeah but that's
that's it for my half okay we'll end on
that awful awful note the only thing
that could possibly pick us up from here
is moving on to Paul's my half of this
so guys thank you very much for tuning
in don't go anywhere though you can
follow the link in my description if
you're watching me on YouTube
to go to Paula's Channel it'll take you
right to the second half of today's
stream or you can stay right where you
are on twitch TV / awesome hardware
thank you to anyone who's gonna do time
stamps your every day tech if that's you
you too man you too man
and also thank you for in advance to
anyone who picked up anything from
either of our stores we will be giving
you johnson shoutouts during the after
party right after Paul's half that's
true
and also anyone who donated in super
Chatwal security system you have booze
alright guys we'll be our back bye bye
bye cut cut</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
