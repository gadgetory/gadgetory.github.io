just go ahead and take a look down
alright today is super exciting because
we get to do episode two of this
wonderful new series which has Pitt my
rigs where we take a subscribers gaming
PC it doesn't have to be a gaming PC I
guess could be any PC we accept all pcs
here we don't judge
and we basically pimp it the heck out
usually it's sort of an aged or olds or
dilapidated system hello hey Josh
I left my define s and our six in the
same room together last night and now
there's a third case like what's going
on baby let me guess it's got a PSU
shroud flexible yeah actually wait hold
on how do two computer cases you know
make a baby I don't have time to explain
this to you you need to know how humans
do it first I gotta go okay okay I gotta
ask you guys do you like touch dust
filters or something is Lube even
non-conductive is there thermal paste
involved and if so you know where does
it go now staying silent okay good talk
just wrap it up next time we're running
out of space the define us to from
fractal design features front panel USB
see ample water cooling support and a
clean interior layout for your next
custom build click the link below to
learn more today we actually have a
gaming rig from Brandon he's a 19 year
old student from Huntington Beach
California and this is the gaming PC he
built a couple years back with his dad
and it's it's actually in pretty good
condition all things considered but the
hardware is definitely getting a little
old here inside we've got a core i5 4570
processor at 3.2 gigahertz that is of
the Haswell family from intel and that's
paired with an msi b85 g43 gaming
motherboard so definitely no
overclocking happening here but
okay because we don't have a great
cooler on here anyway we've got a hyper
t4 from coolermaster which also looks a
little bit dated to say the least kind
of hanging on by a thread here with
eight gigs of ddr3 a vexer LED memory at
21 33 megahertz and our graphics card is
the sapphire r9 270x toxic Edition which
is definitely starting to show some wear
and tear especially on the metallic
parts at the end of the backplate it's
looking a little bit rested there so we
might have to do something about that as
well our power supply is a CX 600 from
Corsair it's actually a fairly decent
budget unit although it's got those
nasty ketchup and mustard cables that we
just can't allow on this series we've
got two mechanical hard drives in here
so plenty of capacity but there's no SSD
in this bill so Brandon's been booting
off of spinning rust for the last few
years so I'm guessing he probably just
hits the power button goes to class for
the next eight hours when he comes back
his his systems finally booted into the
desktop so we're gonna have to fix that
as well all of his hardware is nicely
enclosed however inside of the master
box like five from Coolermaster it's
actually a fairly decent case for for
being a budget oriented option it's got
some modern features like a power supply
shroud RGB fans at the front of course
and tempered glass side panels so that's
looking alright as far as the actual
build itself goes I mean it's completely
color mismatched obviously I won't fault
them for the RGB fans because they're
supposed to change colors but everything
else is kind of clashing right we've got
sort of an orangish yellow graphics card
red accents on the heatsinks for our
motherboard blue LEDs on the RAM it's
just kind of a mess overall and I think
we should probably go with a singular
colour theme with the help of some RGB
lighting along the way cable management
isn't the worst I've seen but it could
definitely use some improvement we've
got this molex cable that's just kind of
hanging out here of the power supply
shroud I'm guessing maybe that that
happened during transit when you brought
the system over to me and we've also got
just sort of loose cables here that
really aren't utilizing many of the the
cutouts that the case offers even though
it's maybe not the best chassis for
cable management he did do a fairly good
job on the backside for what he was
given it's actually not too bad back
there he you know he utilized some zip
ties and tie-down points and things like
that before we start cutting things left
and right though Brandon is a die-hard
gamer he's car
playing a lot of pub G with his buddies
and he's averaging about 45 fps in that
game right now at the lowest possible
settings at 1080p while all of his other
friends are pretty much soaring past the
hundred Hertz 100 FPS mark so definitely
an unfair advantage for Brandon in the
hardware department which hopefully we
can change later on he also plays doom
battlefield 4 and a bunch of other
titles that his system may be currently
struggling with a bit more than it was
when he initially built the system back
in the day so we're gonna try to give
Brandon the competitive edge he deserves
I think we're gonna start doing that by
gutting most of the system there are a
couple things I want to keep here
because not everything needs to go I
think the case is still great it's got a
lot of updated features so that's not
going anywhere
obviously we have to keep his drive that
would be bad the power supply even
though it's a CX unit it's still got 600
watts it is 80 plus certified and I
think it's gonna be fine for the
hardware that we're putting in here
we've also got a pretty decent
motherboard and platform b85 obviously
there's no overclocking to be had there
but I think we can still yield quite a
bit of gaming performance with a hazard
CPU although I think we did we
definitely need to upgrade that core i5
so I will look into that in a bit but
those are pretty much the the parts that
I want to keep everything else we will
be swapping out in some capacity so
let's just get right into it I say we
start getting our hands dirty now
because we have a lot of work to do
all right so we've just finished tearing
down Brandon's PC and we've only left
the motherboard power supply and drives
installed and I give it a quick dusting
as well there was quite a bit of buildup
in there I'll probably clean it a lot
more as we continue on with the rest of
the build but for now we are ready for
our first wave of new parts starting
with the CPU I wanted to upgrade that
core i5 4570 just a little bit so here
we have an i7 4770k skew because we
can't overclock anyway on that b85
chipset but this will at least bump up
his base and boost clock frequency a few
hundred megahertz while also giving him
hyper threading so maybe he could even
do some light streaming because this
chip is definitely capable of that I'm
also replacing his eight gigs of a vexer
memory with this brand new 16 gigabyte
kit of HyperX savage ddr3 at 2133
megahertz
leo those red heat spreaders they're
gonna match perfectly with the red
accents on his motherboard unlike the
blue LEDs that we saw on those effexor
modules and the last new part we're
throwing in at least for right now is
the master liquid ml 360 our RGB from
cooler master this is a three hundred
and sixty millimeter liquid a Oh which
admittedly is total overkill for a forty
seven seventy that can't be overclocked
however it looks really nice okay that
that's that's a reason unpin my rigs
that is a valid reason the second reason
is for future proofing purposes so if
let's say to three years down the line
brandon eventually decides he wants to
upgrade his whole platform and maybe
drop in a really high-powered super fast
and overclockable cpu he's already got a
really decent CPU cooler that can handle
that TDP load so I think it's gonna be a
good option for him in the long run and
also you might have noticed that I did
remove the three RGB fans at the front
of the case here as well as the fan in
the back that's because this cooler
already includes three RGB fans which
are obviously gonna get mounted at the
front of the case and then I think I'll
use one of those old fans as a rear
exhaust so we get all matchy-matchy from
the front to the back I think it's gonna
look really nice once it's all done so
on that note let's go ahead and get this
stuff installed so we can move on to the
next step
hold on hold on your name must be
Houston because we have a problem
so on the Coolermaster website it
specifically lists three hundred and
sixty millimeter radiator support at the
front of this case but one small detail
it doesn't mention is that in order for
the radiator to fit there you first have
to mount the fans to the inside of the
case and then mount the radiator after
that because if you don't and you just
mount the radiator flush against the
frame it actually interferes with the
front panel cables at the top of the
case and you're unable to slide the
radiator in such a way where it's
mounting holes will line up with the
mounting slots at the front of the
chassis
so I mean we could technically mount it
in there we just amount the fans inside
the case but I think that's a terrible
idea because the front panel is
see-through and you'd be looking at some
pretty RGB fans through the nastiness
that is this front mounting area of the
case and that just it's just gonna look
terrible so what do we do well we
obviously can't use this product anymore
I guess we'll just have to settle for
the exact same thing but in 240 radiator
form thank God I have copious amounts of
hardware at my disposal
so we wasted enough time with this
little mishap let's hope nothing else
pops up and carry on
moving right along here we've got three
more items that were putting in to
Brandon's PC starting with a damn SSD
it's about time to get some faster boot
times here's a savage HyperX 240 gig
it's an oldie but a goodie and it's red
so it matches with the system we'll also
be adding some sleeved cables from Asia
horse I believe it's a Chinese brand not
not too big of a name here in the US I
did feature the set of cables in a
recent video about cables you can check
that out if you wanted to these are
black and red also going with the theme
and they're made of the p80 sort of
plastic he's sleeping very malleable
very easy to shape they retain their
shape very well especially with these
cable comes here so I've got a whole set
for his system and then finally LED
strip courtesy of cable mod this is the
wide beam LED strip and we can its RGB
so you can do it red probably just red
or white nothing else would really match
let's get to work
all right guys we are dangerously close
to finishing this build we have one more
part to install which is of course the
graphics card now we could use Brandon's
existing r9 270x but that would be a
terrible idea
so instead why don't we pop in this msi
geforce gtx 1070 TI gaming and make this
system like a bajillion times faster
also it's red so yeah you got to go with
red
man med look at this build I I did that
it looks so good I am so good at this
no more importantly let's hope that
Brandon absolutely loves it I think he
will unfortunately we'll actually get to
see his reaction in just a bit that
should be really exciting I honestly
couldn't be happier with how this turned
out and I'm really stoked for Brandon to
see it for the first time and to show it
off to his friends and for him to see
their reactions I think it's really
gonna elevate his whole lifestyle as a
gamer overall especially in the frame
rate department gaming performance is
definitely gonna see some serious uplift
with the various upgrades that we made
here so overall really happy for you
Brandon a future Brandon when I finally
see you and speaking of which I think
it's about time that we deliver this bad
boy to its rightful owner I'm gonna miss
you little guy
we've got your sister by the way how was
it not having your system for about a
week or so new sir your honor I had a
laptop but it's not like the graters
laptop yeah yeah even the greatest
laptops in the world it was like four to
four dollars for Walmart whoo oh I'm
sorry to have to put you through this
bra but but I promised the weight was
definitely worth it we're no further ado
Brandon here
you just go ahead and take a look down
like that you know we used the same case
yeah sort of preserve that original look
because I think it's a solid case for
what it is I really wanted to keep your
core platform and because I did you
obviously can't really do much with the
red heatsink so we just decided to roll
with the red yeah how do you like it
what are your initial thoughts and you
feel free to tell me you hate it I'll
completely just like throw it off the
table right now just I'll just destroy
it no I don't know if you know who dr.
disrespected I do with the black and red
yep I love that all right cool looks
really nice and since I did I didn't
have an SSP yes let's do that
yep yep it's already got Windows 10
loaded up onto it we actually swapped
out your CPU for a forty seven seventy
so you got a core i7 now you've got
hyper threading of course we have braid
your graphics card to a gtx 1070 TI msi
it's an MSI gaming card but yeah I think
I think you gonna be happy with it
so enjoy it yeah we're gonna treat it
well love it love it
Valerie gamer on think nice now you'll
have zero excuse to your friends as to
why you're dying left or right yeah you
happen to be losing I guess that's
probably a good problem to happen friend
thanks thanks for the opportunity minute
let me every become was enjoy dude thank
you so much yep alright guys there you
have it that was a quick little reaction
sorry I didn't get any b-roll of Brandon
system here at the park I completely
slipped my mind I think I was just too
excited about the whole thing but at the
other day I think Brian really liked his
new rig and that's really what matters
here so yeah this has been Pitts my rig
episode two guys let me know what you
think about the series down in the
comments cut me some love with a like
and get subscribed for more tech stuff
coming at you really soon also shout
outs a wifey sauce for for filming the
whole thing she did a great job and you
sporting all that so have a good one
guys I'll see you all in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
