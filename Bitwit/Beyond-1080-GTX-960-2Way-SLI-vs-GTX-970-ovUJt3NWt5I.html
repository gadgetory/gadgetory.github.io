network in case you're feeling ill from
all the gtx 960 videos on the web right
now it's about to get downright terminal
cuz today i'll be talking about the
newest mid tier video card from team
green that's been targeted at 1080
gaming and while a vast majority of
gamers who end up buying this card will
indeed be gaming on a single 1080
display NVIDIA has integrated into the
GTX 960 full support for two-way SLI
this means the 960 when paired with well
itself is potentially a viable option
for gaming at resolutions higher than
1080 but does that necessarily make it
the best option for about 50 bucks less
than what you'd spend on two gtx 960 s
the GTX 970 is a powerful card with
twice the vram as a single gtx 960 with
its two gig frame buffer and as we all
know all that precious via ram is
especially useful when gaming at higher
resolutions but remember kids video
memory doesn't magically combine itself
in multi-gpu setups so having to 960s an
sli will still only yield two gigabytes
of vram per card which is not the same
as four gigabytes of vram for a single
GPU as is the case with the 970 now with
that being said I'm about to show you
guys some performance benchmarks between
these two configurations at both 1080
and 1440 to find out which gaming
solution makes more sense and as an
added bonus I'll be showing off stock
and overclock results of both the gtx
960 and sli as well as the gtx 970
with a bass boost clock of 1178 and 1316
megahertz
I was able to take my 960 s to 14 71
megahertz without ever touching the
voltage as for the GTX 970 which has a
base clock of 1050 and a boost of 1178 I
pushed it all the way to 1542 megahertz
while maintaining rock-solid stability
now quickly going over my testing
hardware I've got an 8 core 59 60 X
clocked 240 300 megahertz and x99
gigabyte motherboard and 16 gigs of DDR
for GCL memory at 2666
as far as the cards themselves go I've
got a GTX 960 from ZOTAC which is the
card I used for my single card
benchmarks as well as the primary GPU
for my sli testing you can also expect a
full review of this card coming soon the
other gtx 960 i had on hand was the
gaming 2g from msi
whose factory overclock speeds were cut
down to match the reference speeds of
the zotac card when doubling down yes I
SL I'd these two cards together and no
I'm not particularly fond of interracial
hardware porn and finally the EVGA GTX
970 for the win edition was also under
clocked and overclocked accordingly to
achieve those stock and OC results
you're about to see starting off with
Metro last night I was having trouble
getting SLI to work with both these
synthetic benchmark utility and the game
itself but at the very least here we can
see the 1440 results showing a much
wider lead for the GTX 970 than a 1080 a
perfect example of the extra frame
buffer at work battlefield 4 is where I
introduced the GTX 960 s and sli and
here we see them beating out the single
970 at both resolutions but this time at
1440 the cards are really neck and neck
when overclocked despite the 960 s great
scalability similar scores across the
board for BioShock Infinite with the gtx
960 duo
beating out the 970 once again though
all the leads at 1440 so far have been
pretty marginal and whether or not the
average user would even be able to
notice a difference in gameplay between
these two setups is in my opinion
debatable certainly the strengths of
both of these cards was tested with
Crysis 3
and while the overclocked gtx 960 saw an
average FPS 6 frames higher than the 970
minimum frame rate still barely topped
30fps and was actually a bit lower than
what the 970 was able to achieve and
finally our results in hitman absolution
show the GTX 970 ever so slightly
trailing behind the 960 s at 1440 but
absolutely crushing them when it comes
to minimum frame rates it's quite
possible that the GTX 970 s 4 gigs of
memory is doing a better job at
processing all those various filters
that were enabled in this test
so yes the GTX 960 s in sli beat out -
the single 970 in all 5 of the tests
that I ran but considering the
negligible performance gains at 1440 I
personally don't think that the added
heat power consumption and $50 or more
premium of these two cards is worth the
few extra frames you'll squeeze out of
your games at resolutions above 1080p
couldn't handle that the sli setup could
now it might be a different story if
you've had the gtx 960 in your system
for a while and are looking for a nice
$200 upgrade but this is a brand new
card so that would technically be
impossible so should you pick up two
960s over a single 97
impossibly it's also worth mentioning
that if you're not bothered by power
consumption or the color red the r9 285
and the r9 290 offer exceptional bang
for the buck just hope that bang isn't
the sound of your system exploding but
of course in the world of PC DIY nothing
is really set in stone and this has
merely been my two cents J don't sue me
as always tossed me a like on this video
before you guys go and let me know in
the comments what your take is on the
gtx 960 also</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
