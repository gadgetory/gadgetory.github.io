channel today is hopefully going to be a
fun and interesting video for you all
because I'm essentially going to be
giving you a grand tour of all the pcs
that are currently in the awesomesauce
Network household and that spans about
eleven systems now some of which are
being used on a daily basis or a weekly
basis and others are just kind of
collecting dust and some some of them
don't even have like all the components
some have had their CPU coolers or their
CPUs stripped from them to be utilized
for other purposes or other builds so
I'm kind of I'm going to kind of be
giving a rundown of each of those what
the main system specs are and what my
future plans are for each of these
systems and you know one of the biggest
questions on the channel that I get is
Kyle what do you do with all of these
pcs after you've built them for a
particular video and that's kind of what
this video aims to answer in one regard
but yeah hopefully you guys enjoy it
let's let's go ahead and take a look at
the I don't know there's so many where
do we start where do you start with
eleven computers which one do you talk
about first I'm just gonna like close my
eyes and like pick a pick a system to
talk about so let's let's talk about
this one all right so this first system
is very important and sentimental to me
in many ways because it's essentially
the first rig I ever built with my own
two hands back in 2011 when I was still
working at Newegg with Paul he was one
of my co-workers there and at the time
this was a frickin high-end system it
had a 2600 K in it which has since then
been repurposed to going into my wife's
bill the wifey bill to go ahead and
check that video out if you haven't
already but since then you can see it's
it's just gone there's no more CPU here
so I'm having booted it in a while it
also had do TX 670 direct Cu 2 from Asus
in there so video card was pretty on
point at the time but I think before I
completely scrap it and tear it to bits
I think I want to do one last video and
you guys can let me know in the comments
whether or not you think this is a good
idea but a lot of you have been asking
in the comments lately you know I've got
this older PC you know that's a couple
generations old but I don't know if it's
time for me to upgrade till it's
something like skylake or or even x99 so
I think I'm going to do one last rodeo
with this system and
benchmark be the original rig that I had
in 2011 to see how it stacks up against
current gen titles in terms of gaming
performance and things like that so let
me know if you think that would be a
pretty cool idea and if I am able to do
that that's probably gonna be the last
use that I have for this rig before I
completely disassemble it
that's essentially its this is a really
a very important PC to me again and I'm
gonna be sad to see it go but there you
have it the next PC I have in my arsenal
is the white build and I did a recent
video on this maybe a month or two ago
many of you guys saw it but this is
essentially one of the nicest looking
pcs I've built in the last year it's
probably one of my favorites as well
because of that feature two gtx 980 from
Galax Hall of Fame Edition very nice
card as well as a 6700 K but that's
since then been repurposed into the
silent build the Silent Night rig that I
built very recently but more on that
later what I really want to do is get
that CPU back in here reinstall the
inner max CPU cooler and find a place to
just just to put this to have it on
display because it really is one of the
nicest looking builds that I built in
2015 and I really don't want to scrap it
and the enthu luxe from fantex is just
an awesome case because if you guys
remember that white build video it does
have case lighting on it that can change
I think seven to nine different colors I
forget exactly how many but I also got
the fantex
LED strip that I that I placed right
here on the side of the case that is a
that also changes the same number of
colors the same various colors as the
case itself so altogether it makes it
look really nice but yeah that's pretty
much all I have to say about that rig
moving on to the sleeper system sleeper
PC was a rig that I built oh maybe a
month of cube ago as well where I
essentially took high-end components and
put them in a crappy HP Pavillion case
this is actually my dad's old case from
like five five to six years ago and I
thought I'd make a sleeper PC
essentially by that I mean a really
high-end rig in a crappy case so that
people don't really suspect it or pay
much pay much attention to it
it's kind of like a covert rig I guess
if you will and it's got a 980ti as well
as a gtx i'm sorry a gtx 980ti as well
as 6700 K so latest and greatest from
the Intel skylake platform but you know
when I brought this to CES this year I
thought I had high hopes for it and
while it was a really good editing
machine for my editor we were blue
screaming every time he tried to render
out a video so since then I really
haven't had time to troubleshoot it but
that's my those are my plans for this
rig is to kind of do maybe I'll do a
video on it I don't know just to find
out what's wrong
instantly I'm thinking it's got to be
the memory and usually memory is the the
culprit when you're blue screening that
early on in a system build so maybe
maybe do a ram mm okay test or something
like that just to find out exactly
whether or not this thing should be
scrapped
or if it can be kept around for future
events and different on-site locations
where I need to edit videos so
altogether apart from that little quirk
I'm pretty happy with that system moving
on to the file and build which I think
this is probably the most recent build
that I did let me go ahead and adjust
the lighting here for you this is the
most recent video I did I'm pretty sure
this was for Christmas that's why I
called it Silent Night but what this
essentially was was a really quiet and
silent build designed primarily for
acoustic so you can see I've got a CPU
cooler here that's completely passive or
semi passive I should say because
there's no direct fan attached also a
silent power supply from enter max one
other digi fan digit fanless units which
is excellent I might add it is pretty
pricey but it's completely silent
there's no fan just relies on the heat
sinks again and it's got really nice
sleeved cables as well completely
modular fully modular so this is a
really nice rig but yeah I really have
no plans for this either I don't know if
I should sell it or if I should just
scrap it for parts and use those parts
you know at later dates when I need them
let me know what you guys think I should
do with this system because I'm really
at a loss at this point but moving on to
the 400 dollar budget rig that I made
for Black Friday weekend back
November this is actually a really nice
system that I was very happy with
because I spent so little money on
putting it together and yet it was I
don't know I qualified it as a certified
console killer just because it
outperformed what most consoles can do
or what current gen consoles can do in
this day and age granted it's only got
an FX
4350 in there for the CPU and Radeon HD
7950 but still I was getting you know
well above 40 frames per second on
average at high settings playing at 1080
on triple-a titles like GTA 5 Metro last
light and things like that so I'm very
happy with this rig again it sits in a
core 1000 case from fractal design very
nice budget case and it only has a hard
drive in it currently there's no SSD so
my plan for this guy was essentially to
do kind of like what what to upgrade
first for for a budget PC builder so I
know a lot of you guys have budget pcs
that are very similar to this and you're
probably wondering you know will I have
a hundred to two hundred bucks to spare
I don't know what I should upgrade first
though with my little budget system and
I thought maybe doing a video on that
would be pretty cool so let me know what
you guys think in the comments about
that the next rig here is the stream box
that I specifically use and primarily
and only exclusively use for streaming
episodes of awesome Hardware every other
week anytime pallas over and we're
hosting the episode at my house now this
is a pretty nice this is a pretty nice
system it's mini ITX and I granted it's
a bit large for a mini ITX case so I'm
thinking about downsizing it to maybe
something like one of those small box
size silverstone chassis but right now
it's doing the job it's got a 4770k in
there and we're using that to do all of
our streaming all of our encoding it's
been doing a great job
it's got quick sync and all that sort of
thing but it's also got a black magic
capture card the intensity Pro which is
just one of the best capture cards that
you can get right now
apart from that been really happy with
it and I don't really plan on changing
much to it any time soon
the next system in our list here I
believe this is PC number seven as far
as the video goes is my lovely x99 test
bench I've got a LAN Lee I think it's a
PC
t60 I forget exactly the model name that
might be it but it's a great little
open-air chassis for for a test bench
such such as this one where I'm
constantly swapping out the motherboard
of the CPU the CPU cooler or the video
card or the RAM pretty much any
component possible to do a lot of
testing and benchmarking and things like
that so you can see here this is
actually just below my where my 600 t
system was this is pretty much where it
lives all the time I don't know if I
mentioned this before in the video but I
am like super cramped and have kind of
already outgrown the space that I have
here at the awesomesauce studio at my
home so I wish I could actually get this
somewhere higher up above the ground
above above sea level but this is pretty
much the most I can do for now but rest
assured this system is not going
anywhere anytime soon the only thing
that will be changing or the components
that are mounted to it for testing this
is system number eight and this is my
overkill console killer which many of
you guys saw that was also a very
popular video where the the hardware
specs are really nothing too impressive
here I mean I've got an 8 60 K for the
cpu I've got an r9 380 I believe it's a
it's a mid-range system for sure but
it's just in this beautiful Leanne Lee
PC oh is it PC o8 chassis I know PC o5
chassis I believe that's just absolutely
incredibly pretty
to look at so this is my PC I
really don't use it you know I have no
long-term plans for it but it's just
there to look pretty and nice so it's
totally PC moving on the hotline
most of you guys have already seen this
computer extensively I'm not going to
talk too much about her but this is my
custom water-cooled PC the only custom
water-cooled system that I have in my
house right now
and really the only one that I've ever
built is right here and this is my
primary desktop that I use for pretty
much everything gaming editing web
browsing all that sort of thing it's on
my main desk area it's the only PC out
of my 11 rigs that's actually worthy of
being put on my desk
essentially this is a really nice system
very high end with two gtx 980ti s as
well as a 59 60 X so pretty much I don't
know
it's pretty much as good as it gets in
terms of hardware currently for the
average consumer I did run into a scare
recently there was a bit of a leak with
that 45 degree fitting they're merging
from the emerging from the 240 rad but I
tighten the out of it and I put a
little hashtag PC diaper as you guys
were calling it right on there with just
a bit of paper towel and some tape just
to see if it was going to continue
leaking after continued use and so far
after two three days later it's been
running 24/7 and I have not seen any
kind of leaking issues so really happy
that I don't have to drain the whole
system and you know actually replace
that fitting so things are looking
pretty good right now for hotline I'm
also got the NZ s TQ plus in there which
I recently added it just does a nice
touch to to give it some nice LED flare
there alright so those were all the PCs
that were living inside of my actual
office which is through that door right
there and now as you can see we're
actually in the living room now that
that I share with my wife primarily
where you know there's like our couch
and TV and and living room and stuff
like that and so we're going to be
talking about the last two systems here
numbers number 10 and 11 first of which
is the the wifey build which I was
alluding to earlier in the video that
has that 2600 K this is my wife system
this is Heather's build that I built for
her maybe about a month or two ago as
well and it's got a 2600 K from my old
original system back in 2011 that CPU is
still going strong guys and it's still
overclocked 240 400 megahertz pretty
damn good staying really chilly with
that H 105 cooler excellent cooler that
is kind of hard to find these days but I
kind of went with like a really nice
white and blue color scheme for her
system I think it just just just worked
out that way I had some really nice
BitFenix extensions there for the
sleeving
also the blue strip on the GTX 970 from
EVGA this is the for the win Edition so
you know but my wife's not getting
though you know cheap slouch of a PC
this is a very like powerful system that
can still pretty much run any game on
ultra for the most part and still
maintain some pretty good frame rates to
boot
so um yeah I'm pretty happy with the
system obviously the Evolve ITX from
from fan tix is an amazing case for a
small form-factor build like this one
and I think it just looks absolutely
fantastic another one of my really
favorite looking systems that I've built
in the last year or so alright guys and
this is my final PC of the hour this is
my HTPC which is connected to my TV
right here in our living room where
Heather and I pretty much watch this
every single day apart from hotline the
system probably gets you the most out of
my 11 pcs we're pretty much on it every
single night watching Netflix Amazon
Prime stuff or just browsing the
Internet in the living room but I built
this thing about two or three years ago
and the original CPU which is a which is
a 35 70 K is still in here going strong
also upgraded the initial GPU which was
a 650 Ti boost that's now been replaced
with this black edition gigabyte card
which is a 750 Ti so slight increase
there in performance so we do do some
gaming on this as well we've been
playing a lot of Sonic Sonic all-stars
racing which I mentioned earlier as well
as a bit of lovers in a dangerous
space-time awesome indie game with local
co-op if you guys are interested playing
with another lover but the cable
management in the case like this is
pretty limited just based on how small
it is but thankfully I've got a really
nice fully modular SFX power supply
which is also like the case is also from
silverstone this is one of their sfx
series pretty much the only form factor
of power supply unit that this chassis
supports but it is 450 watt more than
enough to drive the system and it is 80
plus bronze as well so very power
efficient the modular design makes all
the cables a bit more tidy than they
otherwise would be you can kind of see
here there was a bit of cable mess down
there let me go ahead and try to crank
up the aperture here give you a bit more
light you get a little bit of an inside
look you can kind of barely see it
there's a CPU cooler and there a really
nice one from prolimatech excellent
cooler could definitely put a moderate
overclock on it and there's also another
120 gelid I don't know if it's gel it or
gallop there's a gelid fan at the front
there as well as strapped to the cooler
keeps things nice and cool despite the
size of this rig actually
components stay pretty chilly so happy
about that this is also the sg0 5 from
silverstone the chassis itself which is
the USB 3.0 model there's another model
that only has USB 2 but I really wanted
that USB 3 support just if we're trying
to transfer some files you know and want
that faster transfer speed that is
available to us right at the front panel
there is no mechanical hard drive in
here there's just a 250 gig SSD which is
perfectly fine because we actually have
all of our movies and stuff backed up to
the NASS so here's the nask where we
have all of our movies and tv series
stored that way we don't need too much
mechanical storage in the htpc itself
it's all just kind of dedicated there on
the NASS and it is a raid setup so it is
redundant which is really nice but
that's pretty much all all I have to say
about my 11 pcs guys I know this was
kind of a lengthy video but hopefully
you enjoyed kind of getting a brief
rundown of each one if you have any more
questions about each of these systems go
ahead and let me know in comments I'll
go ahead and answer them to the best of
my ability and also if you have any
suggestions on what I should do with
some of the pcs that I really don't know
what to do with if you have any ideas
for maybe potential videos or I don't
know giveaways or something like that
which PC would you want me to give away
if any of them just give me any kind of
ideas on maybe what you'd like to see me
do with either any of these pcs
repurpose them reutilize them in maybe
ways that I haven't thought of yet I
think that'd be really cool
so anxious to hear your feedback and
thank you so much for watching this
video guys go ahead and toss me a like
on it if you enjoyed it feel free to
subscribe to the channel for more tech
content coming really soon and until
next time I'll see you all in the next
video
