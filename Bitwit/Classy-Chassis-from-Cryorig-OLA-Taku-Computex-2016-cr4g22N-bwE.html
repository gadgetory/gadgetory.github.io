Computex 2016 has been overclocked by

making the contents of this video highly
unstable click the links in the
description for more info all right
Jonna P cryo rig booth now and they're
known for all their awesome coolers both
air and liquid arrows but they've
actually got something really new here
that we haven't seen from this company
before which is chassis the first of
which is Ola it's called Ola and it's
still kind of a work in progress it's
not going to be available to until q2
we're not looking at the absolute final
version here but we're getting a pretty
close idea of what the finished product
is gonna look like essentially we're
dealing with a home theater PC that's
supposed to basically look really nice
in any kind of living room environment
that you might put it in cryo rigs
actually done a really nice job by
providing an aluminum chassis that's
kind of cylindrical in shape
it's very minimalistic actually and I do
like the way it looks overall now
internally you can actually put some
pretty decent hardware in here it is a
mini ITX form factor to keep things
small it's got a relatively small
footprint as well you can see here cryo
one's got one of their low-profile
coolers on there you probably couldn't
get much more length there but so if
there's no water cooling of course you
do have a 140 millimeter fan that's
going to be at the top and it's going to
be sucking air upwards exhausting hot
air at the top there's ventilation on
the sides on either side of the case as
well to introduce some nice fresh intake
and we've also got some storage options
here you've got either a single
two-and-a-half inch or a three and a
half inch drive or you can actually put
two SSDs in here if you don't need a
mechanical drive in there so you can
actually see we've got on the back here
a riser card for your GPU and we've got
a full full on Founders Edition GTX
Canadian here so definitely plenty of
clearance for a high end GPU if you did
want to turn this into like a high-end
gaming system you could do that
there's even some cable clips here for
cable management to keep things nice and
tidy overall a pretty nice pretty nice
package here from prior rig and they've
also been experimenting with other
designs instead of just aluminum as the
exterior plate they've also been messing
around with kind of a wood finish which
i think looks really cool depending on
the living room environment that you
want to put one of these in so again QT
you stay tuned for that
they've got one more case over there
let's check it out alright so this is
the Taku this is Cryer Raikes other case
that they're showing off here this is
actually probably going to come in a
little bit earlier a little bit sooner
than the
so we're probably expecting anywhere
from really late this year and possibly
q1 next year if you guys are interested
Taku actually means desk in Japanese and
it's a very befitting name for this
particular product because as you can
see here it is kind of like perfect for
the minimalistic desk environment so
basically what you have here is it kind
of looks a little bit Mac ish I want to
say it looks a little bit like an apple
product but that's not necessarily a bad
thing it even has some elevation here so
you could put theoretically a keyboard
and mouse slide it under and tuck it
away for convenience and just to give
yourself a nice clean aesthetic it's
also got like a power button here and if
you push in the the full desk you can
actually slide out the entire PC if you
want to work on it
swap out a product or swap out a
component if you need to and it's just
really convenient and easy to use and
here's a look at the internal so again
we're dealing with a mini ITX system
here with a pretty much a full-size
graphics card support I want to say that
looks anywhere from like 9 to 10 inches
that you could fit in there right now
they have an AR nine Nano which that
actually has a big cutout on the
backside for ventilation so you're not
completely suffocating the fans on your
GPU which is also nice I did forget to
point out that it's an SFX power supply
that's going to be in the Ola forgot to
mention that same here you're dealing
with an SFX power supply just to keep
things really small and compact SSD
mounts all that good sort of thing and
that's pretty much gonna do it for now
guys check out the links in the
description below for my sponsors
thinking huge shout out to gigabyte
fantex g.skill and cable mod i'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
