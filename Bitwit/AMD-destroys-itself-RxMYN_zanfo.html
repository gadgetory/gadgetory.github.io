be pretty quick and dirty because wifey
sauce and I actually have to leave in a
couple hours to the mountains I
shouldn't say we have to we get to leave
in a couple hours we're just gonna hang
out with some friends relax for the
weekend unplugged for a bit so sorry if
this video is feeling a bit rushed we
literally leave in like two hours which
of your content creator you know that's
basically zero time whatsoever to get a
video done so sorry in advance but let's
continue we have this big old beauty
route here so in CES earlier this year
at CES I actually did a sponsored build
would be quiet in their suite it was
really fun we did it inside of their
dark base 700 white Edition and I
actually haven't even unboxed it since I
got back seven months ago we've got a
twenty nine seventy WX which is a twenty
four core forty eight thread thread
Ripper two CPU that's got like 64 gigs
of ram in it I forget what GPUs in there
maybe 20 80 20 ATI and one of the two
but at any rate the reason why I'm
bringing it back up today is because AMD
recently dropped the prices on a lot of
their thread Ripper SKUs that includes
the 24 core part but I'm more interested
in testing their 12 core 29 at 20x
mainly because the core in thread count
directly competes now with the risin
nine 3900 X which in my last video is
now inside of the Dan case a four build
with 16 gigs of DDR 4 and gtx 980ti if
you want to find out more about how this
actually functions with a 12 core inside
of it go ahead and check that video out
it's kind of interesting but here's the
deal 3900 X is 499 US dollars after the
price cuts the 29 20 X is now 650
dollars yes that's a bit more expensive
however we're gonna have a quick
showdown between these two CPUs today to
determine which one is the better Buy
I'm not gonna do a whole lot of tests
I'm going to do Cinebench and Adobe
Premiere Pro this is the actual system
I'm going to test with the 3900 X so
it's already sort of at a disadvantage
with a cooling solution in place which
has a 92 millimeter liquid ao
whereas our thread Ripper rigs actually
rocking a be quiet dark rock pro 4 yes
it's an air cooler but it's one hell of
an air cooler outperforms a lot of
liquid coolers in fact and of course we
have a large chassis so there's gonna be
a lot more airflow pumping through that
thing than this guy should be kind of an
interesting test yes it's not apples to
apples because of the chassis and the
coolers and all that but again rushed
video so on that note let's get started
all right so we've got both of our
systems set up here got the 3900 X built
in this corner and the 29:20 X over here
you can just see the size differences
vast I'm gonna test the 3900 X first
because it's ready to go
whereas I have not touched this system
again since January so right now we're
doing like tons of Windows updates it's
already been like half an hour and still
going strong on that note I'm gonna go
ahead and start our render test here in
Adobe Premiere Pro this is a 10-minute
4k clip rendered out with h.264 encoding
all right timer is good we're gonna
start the clock right now all right I'm
gonna let this guy do his thing and
we'll be back in a few minutes okay that
was pretty fast 9 minutes and 14 seconds
is the score we got up to ninety two
point six degrees Celsius at its hottest
although I think it was sort of hovering
in the high 80s to maybe 90 see yourself
obviously very warm but if you guys
watch the last video we went to detail
about that not too bad though for a 92
millimeter liquid a oh clock speeds
we're looking really good as well the
whole time we were hitting in the high
threes even the low fours you can see
here a lot of the cores actually spiked
up to 4.6 just over 4.5 gigahertz on
some of the cores at time so that's our
score for premiere it's go ahead and
fire up city bitch alright so the bench
are 20 now here we go come on get it
alright what do we get seven thousand
and forty seven points I'm gonna run the
test two more times then we'll take the
average because sometimes Cinebench
scores can be a little inconsistent this
room is so ugly it renders me speechless
alright r3 Cinebench runs are done those
are the three scores averaging to 7,000
and 17 points for the multi-threaded
test alright and Windows updates is done
on our threader per system or I'm gonna
start with Cinebench at this time for
the sorry that's probably making you
sick right just like a 3100 X I'm gonna
do three runs and then we'll Everage
amount okay the results are in our risin
nine 3900 X got a score of seven
thousand and seventeen in the
multi-threaded test in the same test our
risin thread Ripper twenty nine twenty X
scored five
thousand seven hundred and two the 3900
X outperformed it by 23% and it's $150
cheaper whoo
my boy is killing it so it's pretty
evident as to why AMD recently slashed
the prices of their second gen thread or
four CPUs I think they should have
slashed him even more because it's not
even performing in the same ballpark
which is insane of course there's still
the argument to be made for high-end
desktop platforms like x3 99 here if you
have a need for the extra i/o there's
more connectivity onboard you get more
PCIe lanes granted there PCIe gen3
versus Gen 4 now you also get things
like quad channel memory support but at
the end of the day the 3900 X is just an
absolute unit I'm just super impressed
right now let's try the premiere test
and see what happens
all right we're just about ready to
start out from your test here exactly
the same clip same effects and
everything same render settings and we
are ready to rock remember the time to
beat is 9 minutes and 15 16 seconds 9
minutes and 14 seconds just just like I
said all right here we go
3 2 1 go all right so how do our 29 20
acts stack up against the 3900 X in a 10
minute 4k render in Adobe Premiere Pro
15 minutes and 54 seconds compared to 9
minutes and 14 seconds with the rise in
9 part and really this system had every
advantage going for it I mean I had the
better case with more airflow it had a
better cooler this thing was like
hovering in the 60s it was like 65 to 70
see the entire time and still the 3900 X
could not be stopped the multi-threaded
performance of the 3900 X is
unbelievable I mean unless you need the
extra IO I think the 3900 X is by far
the better value as demonstrated today
the 3900 X just continues to impress me
every time I test it and do something
new with it the multi-threaded
performance for 500 bucks a 12 core CPU
that's outperforming a 2nd gen rising
thread Ripper 2920 X by that much and
it's $150 cheaper it's just really cool
right now that this kind of performance
this level of performance is coming to
the mainstream desktop CPU market
there's my quick and dirty video guys
sorry again that it's quick and dirty
but I'm gonna bounce out of here guys I
got a mountain to climb I'm probably not
gonna climb it and too lazy for that
I'll see you guys very soon thank you so
much for watching toss a like on the
video if you enjoyed it get subscribed
for more haphazardly thrown together
videos like
this one and now we'll see you guys in
the next video ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
