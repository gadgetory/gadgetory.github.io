features seventh gen Intel Core i7 CPUs
geforce ten series graphics and blazing
fast and vme SSDs click the link of the
description for more info what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well today we are doing
episode two of stack attack you guys
gave us some really positive responses
on the first episode so we're bringing
it back we're gonna hopefully try to
make this a monthly thing the way it
works is that Heather and I go 1v1 in a
random PC game for starters we're
actually gonna be playing csgo arms race
again just so that we can iron out some
of the game mechanics before we start
switching up the actual game in future
episodes but the way it's gonna work is
during the match Heather and I will have
four attack cards each that we can play
on each other to sort of work one
another in hopes of winning the game of
course additionally we've actually
tweaked some of the rules since the
first episode / some of your suggestions
including the fact that we're gonna be
dealing the cards this time around
completely randomly so we won't actually
know what's coming to us until moments
before the round starts and I'd also
like to mention that the cards are
actually completely different this time
around since it's October we thought it
might be kind of fun to do a slight
Halloween twist to the cards kind of
like a little theme going
so what's it with the cards on each
player can stack the cards to make a
stronger attack on the other player and
you can only do up to two cards and they
have to be played simultaneously so if
you are caught playing an attack card in
someone and then a minute and I would
never do such a thing you play another
that would be considered cheating and
therefore we result in a one minute
penalty freeze also both players have to
play at least one of their attacks
within the first three minutes of the
round this is another rule that we've
added just to speed up the the very
beginning of the game if three minutes
happens to go by and you haven't played
an attack by then you don't necessarily
lose that attack you can still play it
later on in the round but you do incur a
30 second freeze penalty what we have
also changed about the game is once a
player gets to level 15 you can no
longer play any of your attack cards so
basically we are trying to kind of level
the playing field a little bit so that
the other player that speak line will
have a chance to catch up and you guys
will see once we start playing what
level each of us is at and things like
that so the punishment for whoever loses
today's episode around is going to be
having to chug a sweet and salty
surprise and we'll leave it at that you
guys can stay tuned to the end of the
video to find out exactly what Heather
is going to be drinking later I ain't
drinking it but let's quickly go over
our 10 cards here now bear in mind since
we have 10 cards and we're only drawing
4 cards each that there will be two
cards left out of play so we won't
necessarily know what the other player
has 100% but on that note our first
attack is headless horseman carve two
eyes out of a pumpkin and wear it on
your head while playing an amputation
your body and clothes can't touch your
mouse and keyboard instead get creative
with objects in the room mirror of good
reverse any single tack on to your
opponent mirror of evil play while
looking into a mirror Baconator game
while wearing a pig mask switcheroo swap
the position of your keyboard and mouse
devil's candy finish eating a chicken
nugget slathered in ghost pepper hot
sauce before you resume playing which is
cauldron Bob for two apples before you
continue playing nightmare on nail
street play while wearing Freddy Krueger
fingernails and finally mummified the
attacker wraps their opponents and
plastic wrap before both players resume
gaming so those are our cards I think at
this point we can go ahead and shuffle
them and draw them randomly
well now look what I just got headless
horseman and then witch's cauldron house
gonna be bobbing for some apples I'm
looking at my hand and I'm not
particularly thrilled because I know
Heather probably has most of the really
good cards but then again I am slightly
better than her at csgo so there we go
it is on you nervous like so nervous you
can't even aim
oh come on there we go Bruce blood again
Nightmare on Elm Street so with this new
rule where we have to play an attack
from the first three minutes of the
match I'm going with the nail attack
card because it's the one that I feel
might be the least effective can't find
you care of evil I honestly don't think
that the mirror of evil is gonna affect
Kyle that much so I wanted to play it
first I kind of just get it out of the
way it's just totally Pleasant oh my god
you think you can't chew my god come on
oh my god you want to know how the nails
are going do you really want it now back
how it's going right now cuz I can't do
anything oh my god
I like K even move with these nails like
I will never ever get used to this oh
yeah oh yes oh my god well this is like
making me nauseous so not only is this
mirror throwing off my perception of the
game and causing me to miss everything
but it's actually making me pretty
nauseous like sick to my stomach
full-on dizziness it's really bad what
all right
what what oh my god I can't oh my god
Cupid Mayer yes come on oh my god oh my
god wait wait oh my god oh my god yeah
oh my god I can't even tell you I can't
even tell you how difficult this is oh
Jesus
yes okay oh hello - yes Oh God
Oh No I'm done oh thank god
okay here we go oh dude I am still a
little nauseous freakin here Pierce
kills baby
oh my god
this is so nerve-racking I feel like I'm
shaking right now should be
don't ever let me sneak up on you like
that
Oh
oh that was an unfortunate spawn Oh God
are you kidding me right now okay screw
this pumpkin all right I can handle the
carving no problem but the thing weighs
a metric ton so dick move honey dick
move and there's come on that's got to
be right there we go
all right one minute on the timer okay
oh yes oh my god
turns out if I just heist the pumpkin up
with my shoulders the weight is a
non-issue but now I don't have
headphones and I can't hear shit I can
hear myself dreaming yeah suck it yes
get out of your pumpkin
give me my ears back
ah shit I really be mind again
you certainly are oh shit
ma yes damn it
oh shit my goodness I cannot hit shit
with this gun oh my god finally oh the
worst gonna stop it actually doesn't
work you have to hold it switcheroo swap
temper if she oh I don't think so
fine nerve good what a shitty card I
knew she had that card because she has
all the good cards oh my god this is
difficult
Oh
Oh enough yes
shit so I'm in the lead I just hit level
15 I'm close to winning but with the new
rule in play I can't actually play any
more of my attacks I basically wasted
two of them come on is this thing ever
gonna run at a time I will kill you imma
get you
believe how bad I am at aiming and this
freaking timer seriously exactly that's
right keeps going - yeah the cubes are
broken oh thank god
yes that's it I can't believe I had no
idea that Kyle was one kill away from
winning the game and I didn't use the
witch's cauldron which is the best card
in the game I'm never going to forgive
myself for this 2-time undefeated stack
attack champion thank you very much
Heather are you ready for your
consolation prize
well wifey sauce did you ever imagine
yourself in this position and then
beginning of the match I did not but I
