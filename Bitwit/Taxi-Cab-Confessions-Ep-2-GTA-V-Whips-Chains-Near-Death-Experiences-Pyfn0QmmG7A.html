got doing got done doing your mom man
nice that's good to hear explains the
disappointed look on her face
what do you do when you're not perusing
Los Santos little voice acting little
radio have you seen a despicable me yeah
yeah yeahs the minions no you did not
give me give me a little demo give me a
little uh give me some proof I want some
evidence in a world what bad man fucked
Robin all your dreams will come true
that that didn't sound like one of the
despicable Me met me minions I don't
think they would actually say that in
think it's a children's film isn't it so
I'm intrigued about your voice acting
tell me more well I'm a pretty good liar
I guess I've done game casting that's
kind of the only experience I haven't
voice acting what do you do now I'm just
going to school I've had a few different
weird jobs what's what's the weirdest
job you've ever had I used to be a
linesman what look like for comcast my
god unfolds make repairs oh no shit how
how was it what's what's your craziest
story from that I'm sure you've got some
good ones weird animal encounters
finding weird stuff in people's houses
like what I got to go in people's houses
sometimes well you know any and
everything BDSM yes nice oh yeah dude so
many more people are into that than you
would think wow here's the thing its
people the most private place in
someone's house is usually their master
bedroom closet yeah that just happens to
be where there's a junction box in a lot
of houses right so I have to go there
sometimes and they just never would
think that you need to go in there
normally they don't think to put things
away i don't know like big wooden
crosses with like leather straps on them
and swings and any and every kind of
dildo obviously do they ever like to see
you going in there and like go like oh
shit yeah i mean they know i'm gonna go
in there
it's like they just must think like oh I
don't have time to put this stuff away i
guess i don't care if the comcast guys
knows you'd think that eventually i
would have had some kind of weird
opportunity but nope looks like the
shadiest thing you've ever witnessed at
comcast the shadiest he said yeah i mean
other than the obvious that you were
mentioning earlier well there was this
it was my actually my second day ever
yeah on the job and I still was like in
training I was just going around in
another text truck with him and we
you're not supposed to move furniture in
people's houses but we did and we moved
this one dresser for this woman because
there's just a little tiny lady at home
and she could usually you have to tell
the customer to move the furniture just
so it doesn't get broken or whatever
yeah so she's like I can't and you know
we understood we moved it and we opened
the top drawer of this dresser and just
rolls of cash just rolls and rolls and
rolls and rolls all rubber band it up
quick and we like the guy the tech that
I was with was like look just so you
know you can't touch that like look he's
like obviously you're not supposed to
steal but it's like this looks illegal
so definitely don't touch it yeah and we
just close it back up and you know left
in the noon say anything to the lady
about it but that was that was
definitely some kind of drug money or
something Wow in the dress like the
drawer was just completely full of it it
wasn't just like a couple well roll it
looks it looked pretty full definitely
yeah it looks pretty full I mean I
didn't look all the way in there
anything but it wasn't it was most cash
I've ever seen in my life the the look
that you and your partner must have
given each other at that moment must be
stated really yeah
have you guys ever gotten close to dying
like have you almost almost died me yeah
whoever up times a couple times doing
what we're all messing around and this
one asshole pushed me and I fell three
stories what I landed in Butch's that's
the only reason I lie I'm alive oh my
god did you break anything or oh shit
yeah wait how does that happen where
someone just pushes you and you fall off
three stories like we're on the roof oh
my god first stupid ass kids Jesus
Christ was he he wasn't trying to push
you off the roof was he he was not an
accident okay yeah was an accident
should if he tried to pull me push me on
like kill him yeah seriously man before
he kills you jeez what what did you
break I've all together in my life or
just an act just just that incident i'm
wondering what kind of injuries you
sustained from a three-story fall oh I
well I landed in some nice bushes but I
broke my leg three ribs and my arm oh my
my girl on my clavicle all at once
pretty much oh but that pains me just
yeah I wasn't hearing that I was in some
serious pain so what like what what
would be the next steps after that like
someone calls you an ambulance or call
your parents I don't know I don't know
that's I think next thing I remember I
woke up about eight months later
seriously wait are you serious not
really eight months no okay was about
two months they had me on pain
medication out the wazoo I guess the
next thing you remember from that
incident was two months later yep no I
get I don't know what happened all's I
know is that that's what they told me
you was broken I don't know
I probably whose internal injuries and
so but yeah yeah I was always pretty
thing and you said the hell is uh yeah
well the other time I uh I was hit by
the drunk driver clearly clearly his
ball has a life to pull me out what that
was when I was older though yeah they
had to use the Jaws of Life to get me
out i was freaking seriously they there
they didn't think the human body could
could talk that way oh my god i hadn't
like I'm the only thing I the only thing
that happened to me I had a slash across
my chest Wow nothing else what walk
watched a walk me with the whole thing
like what what happily you were driving
you were driving it was normal and then
out of nowhere suddenly here where I
came down the hill it's hit me 60 miles
and I rolled over all the way down the
hill oh my god your car actually like
was humble rise I had a cut across my
chest from I think it was the seatbelt
and were you were you know you knocked
unconscious when he hit you or were you
conscious for the whole tumble down the
I was conscious for the whole thing I
was I thought I was dead seriously I did
oh my god I mean I thought I was dead I
thought I was I couldn't move for the
longest time after you hit me cuz you
know your body goes into that whole
shock your body would go into the you
know I'm going into rag doll mode
motherfucker yeah yeah so I couldn't
move anything what was like wow I was
just so lucky what kind of thing what
kind of thoughts do you even have in
that moment yeah I was up all its I'm
over I remember saying well this is the
end or if I lived a good life that's the
last thing no that's all I was thinking
of and before you knew it these what
firefighters were pulling you out i'm
guessing with the jaws of life yeah yeah
you're like don't move your body like
okay I can't move it anyways and that
one of them say oh that's insane yeah
but hey i'm very happy i seriously
