to you by fractal design MSI and cable
mod check out the links in the
description below where fractal Josh
will throw a pie in your face alright
guys we're kicking it here now at the
patriot booth taking a look at a brand
new keyboard from these guys this is the
V 770 it's brand spankin new and it is
of course as you can see RGB illuminated
with perky illumination so you can
actually go into the software and
customize it just however you want it to
each individual key is programmable you
can actually see over here we've got
some macro buttons it's not too many I'm
glad that there's only a single row
instead of 2 or 3
it kind of just keeps it a little bit
slimmer plus a little bit more narrow on
the desk over here we have a very nice
wrist rest that's actually also RGB
illuminated and unfortunately you can't
configure that or change that it is
gonna be stuck to this color cycling
mode however some really cool feature
here is that you can just remove it with
a magnet and there's a little
gold-plated connector right there
to activate the LEDs over here moving on
we've got a couple actual hardware
buttons or keys I should say for your
lighting effects so there's a number of
lighting effects that if you didn't want
to go into the software you just want to
do something really quick on the fly if
you tap any of those and switch it up to
your liking
we've also got some multimedia keys over
here and it's actually kind of a nice
little control solution that they have
here feels really good very tactile
volume we all got to love that USB
braided cable very nice kind of a red
and black design there there's also USB
pass-through 2.0 of course and an audio
jack as well right over here on the
right side go ahead and focus that for
you yeah yeah you don't see too many
audio pastors on keyboards we've been
cool to see a microphone too but maybe
in a future revision let's go ahead and
move over to the headset this is
actually a pretty sweet looking headset
they aren't Connor percent sure on the
MSRP yet but it's looking pretty good so
far this is the man the names are so
confusing it's the V 370 yes that is
correct the V 3 V 370 it actually has a
really nice matte finish it almost looks
like that kind of rubbery texture design
which is really soft and smooth to the
touch it's also extremely light and very
comfortable I put it on it's got faux
follow-up leather ear cups
also comes with these replaceable fabric
ones that you can swap out I I
personally like the pleather they feel
pretty good you've also got RGB lighting
of course on the side there where you
can see the little accent going around
the Viper branding these are I believe
semi-open I'm just from testing him out
I'm additionally you've got a microphone
this is a headset afterall it just
swings down like that
oops sorry for the focus it doesn't that
flex really but I'm sure it'll pick up
just fine it folds back up and that'll
obviously mute it when you're not using
it as a headset you should want to use
as headphones non-detachable braided
cable again it kind of matches with the
the the keyboard with the red and black
stitching it is braided looks very nice
if you look over here I've actually got
some more action on the ear cup itself
volume wheel whoa let me go ahead and
focus
yeah well email wheel right here in this
little thing will activate a drumming
drumming marching band that's that's
that's what this which does know it
activates some sub sub drivers that are
thirty millimeters that actually kind of
creates a vibration effect when you're
in games gives a bit more immersion to
the experience of course you can always
disable that if it's not your thing I
think of it kind of like as a rumble
effect like that a lot of a gaming
controllers have but seems pretty cool
and you've also got a really nice
construction here metal look at that a
metal band a metal band usually this is
one of the biggest points of failure for
a headset so I'm really glad that
they've included some metal right there
with of course number so you know that
it's even on both sides and some padding
on the headband as well that is faux
leather I believe overall very nice
little package here from Patriot alright
so here we have the last piece of the
puzzle in this peripheral game here in
the seventy line this is the v5 70
Gaming Mouse you can see it's got the
very aggressive design thank you very
much Paul for hand modeling for us
that's got some rubber grips on the side
it's got 13 programmable buttons 12,000
dpi but like the rough even said who
even needs that who knows it's also got
a laser sensor on the bottom there with
some interesting-looking feet it's
definitely got a unique unique aesthetic
let me know in the comments what you
think of it that's also it also has a
built in weight system which I think
it's pretty cool if you want to pop off
that panel it is magnetic so really easy
to access swap out let's see two four
six up to six different weights I forget
how heavy they are but I'm sure you guys
will be covered
Arlis of what your preference is
definitely a nice design if you look at
the scroll wheel it has a bit of a
rubber rubber texture on it too for a
better grip it also has a really nice
braided cable again going with the the
red and black theme on the stitching and
whatnot overall very nice Mouse here
from from from good old Patriot did I
mention there's RGB lighting on this
Mouse I'm sure you couldn't tell and
also a sniper button for all of you
first person shooter gamers out there
pretty sexy so if you guys are looking
for something a little bit more
economical I mean you don't want to go
quite on the 70 series line they also
have their 30 series in the Viper lineup
so here we have the V 330 over headset
and the b3 61 and basically you just get
a little bit a few fewer features maybe
terms of like the RGB functionality this
is I think just a static red things like
that but still same build quality still
same awesome microphone and an braided
cable and things like that here's the V
730 keyboard it does not have RGB
functionality but it does have quite a
few cool led effects of course you don't
get an RGB whatchamacallit wrist rest
either but some people actually prefer
the more subdued aesthetic I actually
personally like it a lot oh wait I
totally forgot to check what switch this
is oh these are these are kill Browns
wait what's but the other keyboard hold
on if you think Paul father was Oh
drops these are kill Red's got it I can
live in peace I will what what the hell
are you doing nerd and finally we've got
the v 3 the V 5 30 I should say it
actually has a totally different look
than the 570 I might actually like this
a little bit better in terms of
cosmetics I'm look at this though it's
got a it's got a switch to just turn off
all the LEDs on the mouse if you're just
like screw lights I just want a simple
mouse and I want it to be discreet
actually you still get RGB functionality
here just straight built into the
hardware I thought this was dpi at first
but it actually just changes the colors
which is really cool on the scroll wheel
feels really nice it's got a nice solid
click very tactile and the side buttons
front and back are also very clicky and
fun to press that's gonna do it for the
Patriot suite here at CES 2017 thank you
