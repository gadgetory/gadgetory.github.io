sponsoring this video I had never played
any of the wargaming titles before so I
was pretty excited when they approached
me with the opportunity to try out their
free-to-play naval combat game I learned
pretty quickly that there's a lot more
to this game than what's on the surface
ocean pun there's a great balance of
action and strategy that makes the game
easy to learn but hard to master making
it the true thinking man's action game
dynamic environments with weather
changes make each battle unique and the
attention to detail on literally
hundreds of ships to choose from make
for some beautifully realistic
firefights despite how pretty the game
looks on your PC you also don't need
crazy high-end specs to run it so it's
kind of a no-brainer if you're looking
for a super fun new game to try out I'll
drop a link in the description that will
let you play world of warships and give
you a special bonus starter pack new
players can register with the code play
warships 2018 to receive 250 doubloons 1
million credits in HMS Campbeltown
premium ship one port slot and three
days premium time take to the sea and
check out world of warships today so
here's the deal guys we were supposed to
meet some random guy named Daniel we had
agreed Daniel and I had agreed to meet
here for a Craigslist deal which of
course was going to turn into a surprise
game show that we like to do here on the
channel called bit later nitwit
you're gonna surprise Daniel with a
chance to win this beautiful mini Rising
5 and GTX 1060 system but lo and behold
he stood us up so now we have no
contestant so I've actually tweeted out
I've tweeted out to my followers that
the first person here would take Daniels
place and receive a chance to win this
beautiful gaming rig in your name sir
Nick Nick and Nick literally just got
here this was a staged at all no no I
noticed first you posted it was a whale
Falco's I actually booked out a street I
was like hey I remember that well Fargo
and I were like
steady Wow have it's like yeah so that
what that wasn't even like that was just
the teaser tweet so you recognized where
I was from from the first we not even
though not even the big hint yeah so
well congratulations for being here
I'm assuming that you want to be on the
show yep yep definitely awesome cool
let's let's get started that was that
was fast
an internet word travels fast on the
Internet these days doesn't it alright
let's do this
tell me a little bit about yourself what
do you do for a living and so you
currently have a gaming PC of your own
that is I actually walk down the street
here I'm actually a IT consultant I do a
lot of related to like consulting
virtualization system networks and all
that so I'm a cool customer has been
putting together solutions I'm glad I
didn't put any networking questions on
any of the cards today but let's go in
do you actually have your own PC yes I
do actually have two one for my gaming
I'm posting the gaming is a $9.99
hundred K where they Asus 10 apex to
1080 TI is water cold in a thermo take
900 snow audition case ok why are you
even here right now I was hey you know
what a gaming PC is still on the line
here yep you can do whatever you want
with it you know obviously if you win it
so are you ready to get into it sure
definitely all right so I don't know how
familiar you are with how this game
works and I'll be asking you a series of
five questions and you need to answer
all five correctly in order to win the
PC should you get stumped at any point
in time you do have a single life line
that you can use o that allows you to
choose two answers for and as long as
you get one of those answers right you
move on to the next question
okay sound good sounds good here are
your five questions please don't go on
to the next card until you've answered
the last one correctly alright and let
us begin
question number one for a computer mouse
what does the acronym DPI stand for is
it a digits per inch
be dots per inch see drops per inch or
deed dancing pixel instrument yeah be
dots pinch final answer yes it is
that is correct it figured as an IT guru
you would have got that right let's move
on to number two which of these is not a
real software for controlling RGB
components in a computer a
NZXT can be asus4 sync see gigabyte
spectrum or d msi mystic light oh this
is tough
how familiar are you with the world that
is RGB hmm I mean I do have a lot of RGB
but that's the closed cr1 NZXT I know
that one that does that does the RTP
piece who suits or sync I have that
that's a question of gigabyte and MSI
hmm I heard about mystic light on your
channel oh but I'm trying to remember
whether that is the RTP component piece
of controlling it hmm I use my lifeline
all right he's gonna use his lifeline so
you can choose two answers right here
all right
see think about a spectrum I'll go with
the MSI mystic light just in case so C
and D are the two that you're going with
yep that's it the answer is C so you are
correct
gigabyte spectrum actually gigabytes of
software the proper name is a gigabyte
RGB fusion hmm okay you're correct in
thinking that that was a little
suspicious okay question number three
here we go you lower your resolution
when gaming but your framerate doesn't
increase what's the most likely reason
is it a a CPU bottleneck
a GPU bottleneck see your monitors
refresh rate or D not enough vram so if
you lower your resolution likely would
it be a GPU bottlenecked
it's likely no because ideally you would
get more if it's not on that's a
bottleneck I would choose C I'm sorry a
CPU bottle name is that your final
answer
don't try to read that's the worst thing
you could possibly do Nick you are
correct
number four that was that was really
cool
little scared I'll be honest but you
power through your heart that's the
point
all right which of these does not belong
in the reliability triangle that defines
the limitations of AMD precision boost -
is a silicon quality B Oh an hour
oh there's no answer a there's no end
okay there's no written on on one of the
cards so I guess you get that as a
freebie that was that was a flaw on our
end the answers would have been a
silicon quality B power C temperature or
D utilization the correct answer being a
silicon quality that is not one of the
limiting factors when it comes to
precision boost to more precision
version one for that matter so great job
Nick you are on you're doing as well if
this is wifey sauce is getting fired
question number five we're here at the
very end
oh this is a wild one several patent
infringement lawsuits one of which
resulted in the payment of six hundred
thousand dollars in damages had
which two companies against each other
over the years is it a as rock and ASUS
be fractal design and Thermaltake see
Corsair in Kingston or D ASA Tech and
Coolermaster Wow this I would have to
guess this cuz I I don't think I've put
this one at all anything jumping out to
you right off the bat it's well cases so
that's one the bull this is special
design thematic FK supposed to have to
stand
I guess that's memory ASA taking
Coolermaster so those are its stuff that
was the point when you're talking about
copyright infringement
it could really pertain to anything the
product I mean there's patents for
everything right so yeah I'm just going
to be like yes yeah I'm just gonna guess
I'm going to choose a as walk-in basis
set your final answer that is my final
answer
Nick I'm sorry but the answer was D oh
he's a token cooler master he came
really close though he came really close
thank you so much for playing thank you
so much yep and we'll see you next time
definitely be Natalie now that I know
that you're in the area I change
location hahahaha thanks thanks a lot
alright so now we have Q q you were the
second one on the scene right after Nick
Nick didn't win so now you have a chance
to pick up the pieces potentially win a
gaming rig what kind of background do
you have in technical knowledge
do you carry I actually work corporate
IT or
for Western down here in Orange County
so I know a little bit I built a builder
rig this year around August 8700 K 16
around Corsair LP x but I would cut our
RGB the 370z 370 II I went the Lian Li P
Co 11 dynamic good sure all bore light
fans love them they were fantastic
awesome sounds like a lovely rig so
while I was asking Nick questions we
actually had you kind of hide in the
distance so you're coming over here any
of the answers so you're completely in
the dark at this point are you familiar
with how the life line works
sort of just to reiterate just to
clarify you basically have one chance
for any of the five questions you can
actually choose two answers instead of
one and that'll give you a chance to
double your odds okay the money should
one of those answers be correct when you
move on to the next question geyser
all right you ready yeah let's do it I
think nervous here your card sir please
don't turn to the next one until you've
answered the first one correctly and let
us begin question number one for a
computer mouse what does the acronym DPI
stand for a digits per inch B dots per
inch C drops per inch or D dancing pixel
instrument wow this is so simple I'm
probably seen it a million times
don't you hate that you're like I know
this I should know this and yet I'm
gonna try B dots per inch so your final
answer yes that's correct
let's move on to question two which of
these is not a real software for
controlling RGB components in the
computer a NZXT cam B ASIS or sink C
gigabytes spectrum D MSI mystic light
that's going to be which is not that's
going to be C gigabyte spectrum that is
correct
very good you got that really quick RGB
has been my life for a year so I guess
RGB does pay off in some capacity
question number three you lower your
resolution when gaming but your
framerate doesn't increase what's the
most likely reason a cpu bottleneck B
GPU bottleneck see your monitors refresh
rate or D not enough beer in I don't
know a ton about bottlenecks
I do know that monitors can be a
limitation when it comes to that sort of
stuff if you have a sixty hurt monitor
you can't go past it can I use a
lifeline can we cut this one up you can
definitely use a lifeline I'm gonna say
A or C a or C set your final answer
yes the correct answer was a so you are
correct
CPU bottle man I don't know anything
what you were saying about your refresh
rate and the monitor is kind of true but
not it limits your refresh rate but the
framerate can still be higher you want
actually refresh that if you won't
redraw that image on screen at that same
price which of these does not belong in
the reliability triangle that defines
the limitations of AMD precision boost -
is it a silicon quality B power C
temperature or D utilization I don't
know at all which is not
I would probably say a silicon quality
set your final answer I don't know
so you yes you're a hell of a guesser
man that is correct what made you get no
just the other stuff seems like
terminology would see in software right
uh software doesn't talk about hardware
like that exactly well deduced sir we're
on the last question which I think is
the hardest it's also the one that
tripped up Nick so we'll see how you do
question number five here we go several
patent infringement lawsuits one of
which resulted in the payment of six
hundred thousand dollars in damages have
pitted which two companies against each
other over the years is it a as rock and
a soos be fractal design and thermal
tape see Coursera and Kingston or D ASA
Tech and coolermaster
I think I've seen this but I don't
remember like maybe in an article yeah
well I know acetic is is aggressive
about their pumps and everybody makes a
bootleg version or something of their
stuff I don't know
I've never heard of anything with the
other ones
deep D as in dog dog final answer yeah
congratulations
you were correct the answer was deep
those pesky ASA tech patents I tell ya
but hey they just won you a new gaming
PC season mine yep that's yours you can
take that home I promise all the
hardware's in there it'll run games over
60fps no problem and it's yours do
whatever you want Ethan a freezin so
