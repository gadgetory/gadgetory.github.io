to you by be quiet cable mod verda gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info alright guys
we are at the cryo rig booth here at
Computex 2017 floor and my voice is
pretty good right now but I'm joined
here with white Gustav so first off
we've got the tacos this thing might
look a little familiar I actually talked
about this last year at Computex they
had sort of a prototype well it's come a
lot further along since then and they're
actually they just launched a
Kickstarter for it you can go ahead and
check that out
if they can actually get the funding on
Kickstarter for this case then we're
going to start to see samples ship
starting this year which is pretty
exciting it's finally almost ready first
of all you'll notice that it's pretty
minimalistic right the aesthetic is
pretty gorge it might be a little bit
Apple s may be too much for some of you
and it kind of does a couple things it
sort of hides your peripherals when
you're not using them see the keyboard
and mouse is sort of tucked away
underneath and we've also got a really a
stand for your monitor and it's a you
know made of a really nice I think I
believe it's aluminum material very
sturdy and you can probably put a pretty
heavy monitor on this thing without
worrying about you know the wooden legs
the nice wooden legs giving out or
anything like that another thing I want
to mention before we crack this guy open
is that right now the early bird special
on Kickstarter is two hundred and fifty
dollars to back for one of these units
and it goes up to 300 if you are not
lucky enough to be one of the first to
back this project now that is pretty see
for a small form-factor mini ITX case
but you're always going to have to pay
sort of a premium for these really niche
products but for those of them for those
of us who actually need something like
this there really are a few options if
that being so let's go ahead and crack
that guy open first of all leave just
that sort of effortless push that wipe
results just demonstrated to really kind
of pull out this tray and reveal all of
your basic components so you can see
sort of the internal layout that we've
got here we'll just go across the board
here starting from left to right you've
got support for an f of X or death
effects out power supply
looks like they've got a modular unit
here with the pretty decent space for
cable management doesn't look like any
of the cable so far or getting cramped
here and then we've got sort of a drive
cage here for I believe a single three
and a half inch drive it looks like you
could maybe fit a second one there if
you did some modifying but I believe
they said the only
one at the moment but then over here
you've got full-length graphic support
looks like they've got a founders
edition in here some sort of GTX 10
series car which is you know 10 11
inches long and it looks like it's
fitting just fine and obviously it looks
like based on how this is oriented you
look you've got a PCIe riser card which
is going from your motherboard to your
graphics card I ask that is included of
course with your motherboard here's a
shot of that and the CPU now you don't
get a ton of CPU cooler clearance
obviously but cry rig does make the
amazing c7 which I did do a build with
quite recently it's a fantastic little
cooler if you're not going to be doing
much overclocking and then over here you
do get a little drive cage for two and a
half inch drives I believe you can fit
two of them in here with an included 92
millimeter fan that is in house from
cryo reg goes up to 2200 rpm it is PWM
and it's black sleeved which is always
very thoughtful even though you know
there's obviously no window
wouldn't it be cool though if there was
a window at the top or at least the
option for a see-through window so you
could kind of glamorize the internal
components that would be pretty sweet
over here you've got front IO two USB
3.0 as well as your audio and microphone
jacks and you can really see that
there's a ton of ventilation just
throughout this entire chassis not not
just the bottom but the top as well the
sides are well ventilated and in the
back is two so honestly even though
there's only one of these included fans
you're going to get a lot of decent pass
passive cooling just flowing through
this case overall before we move on to
the next good thing really quick in the
comments let me know which color scheme
you guys like the best because cryo eggs
still sort of going back and forth on
which one they're going to be offering
and you know or if they're going to
offer all of them so here first off
we've got white face plates on all the
models regardless of the the color of
the shroud the difference will be the
shroud color and the the leg so the sort
of leg finish so we've got a light wood
on the legs black on the outside I know
you guys light like black it's actually
not not a bad-looking one I think this
might be no this isn't my favorite one
but this is silver on the outside you
got some darker wood legs and then over
here you've got black on black over here
we've got silver for the for the chassis
body and then darker wooden legs next to
it red on the outside which is a bit
more aggressive a little bit more flashy
with some nice sort of a subtle gray
legs and then finally at the end I think
this is wifey sauces favourite we've got
a silver silver body white baseplate and
those light wooden legs which which
definitely looks pretty freakin classic
which one do you guys like best let me
know so over here guys we've got the new
Cu lineup of CPU coolers from cryo rig
and Paul and I actually talked about
this on awesome hardware not too long
ago when it first came out or when it
was first announced this is still sort
of in the works you know this isn't a
finished product by any means it's still
sort of conceptual but basically what
you have is all of cryo rigs very
popular or most of their popular CPU
coolers being given sort of a copper
treatment with the fin stacks themselves
and this is actually not just copper
plated but is full copper construction
and materials through and through not
just the heat pipes but the whole entire
fin stack as well which of course means
much better heat conductivity than
aluminum which is what they're
originally made from and not only is
that going to lower the thermals quite a
bit actually they were saying this one
gets you know on their first initial
test lower temperatures by about 10
degrees Celsius we're not sure how
repeatable that is but it's still kind
of an impressive first impression but it
is also going to make these coolers a
bit more expensive if they do come out
simply because it's copper material it's
much it's a bit pricier than their
aluminum brethren so bear that in mind
you will be paying a price premium but
hopefully getting chillier temps as well
the other big difference between copper
and aluminum heatsink construction is
the weight factor so aluminum SEO as we
all know I'm knocking things over here
is very very light whereas copper is not
it's super heavy and in fact this I
think this cooler alone right here which
is not terribly big weighs over two
kilograms it's actually really heavy you
could hurt you could kill someone with
this easily
wifey sauce will demonstrate no no no I
take it back I take it back
so what that also means is cry rig still
maybe has a bit more Rd to do to find a
way to mount these coolers to it's a
little tiny CPUs and make sure that
they're on there sturdily and not going
to damage any part of the CPU the board
or the cooler itself the one that they
said that have the most confidence in so
far is this one the c7 simply because
it's already just so tiny and even
though it is still way heavier than than
any other cooler this size that I've
ever held in my hand it shouldn't be too
much of an issue to mount this to a
motherboard so on that note stay tuned
for more information as it comes to
light
let's thing to talk about here at the
cryo rig booth we've got the r5 cooler
this is sort of a follow up or sort of a
revision I guess a response to their
existing
our one which is a fantastic cooler but
there are some things about it that
weren't super great for example ram
compatibility issues with the r1
particularly on the x99 platform where
you had RAM modules on either side of
the CPU socket which did post some
clearance issues for certain people for
for certain situations this is going to
have full memory compatibility whether
you're talking X 99 X to 99 which I did
just confirm with them and it's also
going to support a.m. for motherboards
right out of the box so that is really
cool price point for this cooler is
about $70 check it out it's going to be
coming out later this year now one thing
I'm really disappointed about not seeing
here at the Craig booth is their new h7
quad Lumi that they announced the
collaboration project they've done with
NZXT to build upon their existing h7 but
with RGB LED supported by the cam
software so that's actually been a real
bummer not being able to catch one of
those what the heck hey what the hell is
that is that it is it seriously it oh my
god oh my god this is it this is this is
it guys just just follow my lead
all my lead I'm I don't know what I'm
doing I don't know what I'm doing just
follow my lead
oh my god oh my god oh my god oh hello</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
