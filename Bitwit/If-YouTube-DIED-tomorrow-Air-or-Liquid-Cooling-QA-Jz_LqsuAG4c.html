all right people were doing a Q&amp;amp;A today
quick and dirty I asked you guys to ask
me pretty much anything about anything
under the Sun which sounds like a
terrible idea but you guys actually
fired back with some pretty good
questions so I'm gonna read them off and
answer them as honestly as I can cuz
that's how a Q&amp;amp;A works start with angry
Batman 2016 what's your favorite game
console of all time I gotta say Nintendo
GameCube it's the only console I ever
woke up at the crack of dawn for and
waited in front of a Gamestop for like
two hours for the doors to open just so
I could secure one of those precious
units and then I got home and played the
crap out of it for like five years after
that some of my favorite games also have
launched on the Gamecube super smash
brothers melee Oh amazing amazing
amazing Resident Evil 4 even though it
was technically also on PlayStation at
the time doesn't matter the GameCube
version was better fanboy logic
timesplitters - I sunk so many hours
into that game Mario Kart Double Dash
with the homies the list goes on really
and the GameCube controller is still one
of my favorite controllers that ever
came with a console ever it's just it's
so ergonomic at least for me and just to
be clear I owned pretty much every other
major console to ever be released in
that era and I played the crap out of
those two but for whatever reason the
Nintendo GameCube will always have that
special place in my heart
coalition gaming rights your channel has
grown tremendously but you still keep
your team quite small I'm sure you have
your reasons but do you see yourself
wanting to hire maybe part-time a person
to help build benchmark research review
or co-host etc this is a great question
that I ask myself all the time and there
are definitely pros and cons to having a
bigger or smaller team I think one of
the reasons I love having a smaller team
right now is it kind of gives us a bit
more creative flexibility and freedom we
can we can sort of pivot directions
creatively or logistically at a moment's
notice
without much fuss whereas when you have
a bigger team it's it's harder to steer
a bigger ship having a smaller team
where I can be more casual and
spontaneous
also helps this whole operation feel
more like a passion project or a hobby
and I think one of my fears is scaling
up the business to have a larger number
of employees and one day looking back at
the good old days and and really
reminiscing and missing that small
ragtag sort of team feel at the same
time having a bigger crew opens up a lot
of doors for content creation I don't
think I've ever be able to shoot a
single episode of stack attack if it
weren't for Chris running around with
the camera shooting both wifey sauce and
knives reactions and that sort of thing
on top of that growing an actual company
gives you a safety net and to paraphrase
Linus in one of his older videos he was
saying that if anything were to ever
happen to him god forbid he ever died or
got seriously injured knock on wood that
his channel would still go on and live
on without him because of the staff that
he's curated over the years and that
thought is something I think about more
and more as the channel progresses as I
get older so I don't really know exactly
I'm still trying to figure this all out
I don't know exactly where the channel
will be in two five ten years from now
all I can do is make decisions as they
come to me and choose what feels the
most right in that moment so I hope that
answers the question Quran asks air
cooled or water cooled for a new pc
builder the fact that you said a new pc
builder leads me to believe that you're
looking for something that's easy to
install no fuss very convenient and
isn't going to be too intimidating for a
newbie builder um in that case I would
say it's kind of a draw between air and
liquid installation is kind of a
crapshoot because the mounting systems
between both camps is completely varied
based on the model of cooler you're
getting so it's kind of a draw in that
situation in terms of reliability you
definitely can't go wrong with an air
cooler there's very little to no risk
there whereas with a CLC or a
closed-loop cooler also known as an a IO
all-in-one liquid cooler it has a lot of
names there's always the potential for
leaking even though it's very rare it
still can happen there is still liquid
inside of those units and if you're
talking about performance it's really
not a black-and-white answer it's gonna
boil down to the CPU that you're trying
to cool and the model of cooler itself
and there are some air coolers that
perform better than some liquid coolers
and vice versa depends on your budget
for the cooler as well there's a lot of
things to consider I've done a video on
all of this air coolers versus
good coolers you should check it out if
you haven't yet there's a lot of good
information there NOAA asks what got you
into PC building that was definitely my
job that I got a new egg in 2011 before
then I didn't know anything about DIY PC
hardware or whatever and in fact just
before my interview I wrote down a list
of all the major components in a desktop
PC and their Miriam Webster definitions
and I committed that to memory just in
case they quizzed me on it during the
interview spoiler alert they did not but
that's certainly an indication of just
what a tech noob I was at the time and
ever since I got that job
it kind of just catapulted my whole
interest and passion into PC building I
kind of fell in love with it over the
years and yeah the rest is history
Landon Landon Landon Landon as someone
who has always been a console gamer is
it worth it to move to PC when you have
such an investment in consoles and their
games my question to you Landon is why
not both it's not like if you build a
gaming PC and buy a bunch of steam games
that all of your consoles and console
games are gonna go away you can still
play those and still have friends that
only play on console that you can
connect with and stuff I don't I know a
lot of people who play both on PC and
console equally and they treat them as
as equals as it should be here in
America in the world does just make a
quality of world thing now if you're in
a financially limited situation where
you potentially have to sell all your
consoles and console games in order to
build your own gaming PC well then I
would still recommend you do it
seriously though I've always been a huge
advocate of trying new things so if you
really love console gaming then you
might love PC gaming just as much if not
more so but you'll never know unless you
try it so go ahead there's a lot of
resources out there my channel for one a
bunch of other tech channels out there
to help you put together your own PC and
sort of decide what components would
work best for your particular needs
Joshua I think that's Twitter gibberish
for Joshua what are your plans after
YouTube fails I like how he says after
not like not like if it fails but like
when it certainly definitely does fail
eventually
sooner than later that's that's a good
question you know there's a couple ideas
I think that video content creation is
something that I'll always feel like
doing and want to do so I think even if
YouTube went down I would find either a
different site that you know was gaining
popularity to post content to or just
start building out my own site and and
directing open you know my traffic there
I also wouldn't be opposed to giving
twitch a shot it's like Russian Roulette
ah you know becoming a partner and and
streaming full-time or more much more
regularly than I do now I think I could
make that work if I actually if I didn't
have YouTube to worry about and I had
all my time to invest in in something
new I think that'd be a lot of fun ah
PETA asks considering to buy a GTX 1082
upgrade currently running a gtx 1066
gigabyte card will my rise in seven
seventeen hundred running at 4.1
gigahertz be a bottleneck for the gtx
1080
no the rise in seven seventeen hundred
can definitely hold its own even with
the GT x 1080 you're probably gonna see
98 to 100 percent GPU utilization with
that combo shouldn't give you any issues
now there are faster gaming CPUs than
the risin 1700 for example if you popped
in an i7 8700 k with that gtx 1080
you'll probably see higher gaming
performance most of the time but that's
not because your GPU is being
bottlenecked any less but rather you're
just gaming with a faster gaming cpu so
I think you're golden here this
configuration is gonna be a match made
in heaven you're gonna see much higher
frame rates than with your GTX 1060 go
for it and go nuts Daniel what are the
monitors in the background of your
videos good question those are asus rog
PG 3 for 8 Q's they are 34 inches curved
ultra wide 20 1 by 9 100 hertz 34 40 by
1440 IPS displays did i get all that
think it did holy crap g-sync I forgot
g-sync damn it
terrible answer Ethan asks do you have a
crush on Paul no Ethan I do not
why did he say he has a crush on me
Marty B what is the best budget editing
CPU now well excuse me
got the burps just add lunch while I
would have to actually do some
scientific testing to determine which
CPU is the absolute best for this
particular need I can give you a
recommendation right off the bat it's
actually one of the chips we mentioned
earlier in this video the risin 7 1700
is a great candidate here it's fairly
affordable you get eight cores 16
threads the fact that there's
multi-threading here means it's gonna
perform very well in multi-threaded
applications like video editing
additionally you could achieve a pretty
decent overclock on the CPU with the
included Wraith cooler which is gonna
save you additional money and you don't
have to buy into the more expensive
platform of motherboard you can just buy
a cheaper be 350 board and be good to go
and still have all that overclocking
potential if you've got a little bit
more coin to spend you could upgrade to
the horizon 720 700 X which is the
second generation successor of the 1700
if you want to take advantage of some
faster clock speeds out of the box and
overclocking potential BJ Bertil what is
your eye color well BJ my eye color is
RGB it's just out of those 16.8 million
colors Brown is my favorite Alex asks
why is my dad not back from the gas
station
well if I had to guess I'll show myself
out ed those are all the questions for
today so thank you guys so much for
sending those in this was a lot of fun
if you have any other questions that
you'd like to put in the comments maybe
I'll go in there a little bit later when
I have some free time and answer a
couple of them but yeah this was awesome
thank you guys so much for tuning in
toss a like on the video if you enjoyed
it and it helps me a lot and there's a
lot more content on the way so get
subscribed to the channel if you have it
yet you can also check me out on
floatplane if you want to watch my
videos a week early without ads for 3
bucks a month I'll put a link for that
in the video description
til next time guys thanks for tuning in
have a good one and I'll see you all in
the next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
