modular mic you can fix to any set of
headphones for the best of both worlds
high-quality voice audio superb noise
cancelling and the option for wired or
Wireless models are just a few reasons
I've been using their products for years
mod mic is a great no compromise
solution for gamers who care about sound
click on the link below to learn more
welcome welcome welcome back today we're
doing a case review this is the fractal
design define s2 vision and it's going
to come in two flavors the vision RGB
which is what I have here today and the
vision blackout editions so the RGB
comes with three no four Prisma a RGB
fans those are very very new very new to
the fractal lineup they're all 140
millimeters you can see there's three in
the front and one at the rear exhaust
the vision RGB also comes included with
a pre-installed RGB LED strip at the top
of the case and one of their adjust r1
lighting controllers
that's if you don't have the proper
headers on your motherboard to connect
the fans or if you just prefer the
controller now if you go for the
blackout Edition you actually exchange
all those fans for their dynamic x2 140
millimeter fans which are perfectly
decent very very high quality and
they're all black to fit the blackout
theme but there's no RGB I don't think
you get the RGB strip obviously you
don't get the the lighting controller
either and there is a $50 price
difference between those two cases so
189 for the blackout edition and then
that jumps up to 239 for the RGB so
let's go ahead and talk about the
outside of the case and we'll work our
way in starting with the glass there's
just so much glass on this case the
front the sides and the top are all
tempered glass they're tinted as well
which may be a pro or con for you
they're very easy to take off there are
two thumb screws holding the side panels
in place I wish they were captive though
you would think for the price point and
being 2019 all that these would be
captive maybe there was a weird design
choice they had to make but there are
two thumb screws on either side panel
and once they're removed you can sort of
unclick the back of the panel in order
to remove the rest of it so you'll
notice that there are no bolts on the
side of the panels which i think is a
pro I think it definitely cleans up the
look overall having all the screws
behind
chassie at the front of the case you've
got air intake on either side and you
can actually see they've recessed the
fans deeper into the case to give them
more clearance between the fan blades
and the front tempered glass side panels
so there's actually a bit more breathing
room for fresh intake to come through
the ventilation gaps have their own dust
filters as well you can simply pop the
front panel off by reaching from
underneath it and just sort of yanking
it kind of like we've seen in the past
although you do have to remove the dust
filter at the bottom of the case first
so there's an extra step there but once
that's off you can actually remove
either of the dust filters on the sides
of that front panel by simply popping
out the little inserts cleaning them off
it's a really straightforward process
with the front panel off you can see
that our prism fans are very cleanly
presented with the mounting strips
behind them as opposed to in the front
like previous defined cases this is
really important now that there's a
see-through tempered glass panel at the
front of the case it definitely cleans
up the look a lot despite there being
two cables that come off each of these
fans they're all routed very neatly
thanks to the help of some cutouts just
to the right the front i/o panel which
is at the top of the case includes two
USB three two USB to ports power and
reset mic and headphone jacks and a USB
3.1 gen2 type-c port for data transfers
up to 10 gigabits per second also
looking at the top of the case we have
again that very nice tempered glass
panel which is removable there's
actually a button behind the case that's
supposed to pop up the top panel
slightly ously you can lift it out that
way
but for some reason the sample wasn't
working all that right for me it wasn't
elevating the panel like it should and
so I couldn't get a really good grip on
it I ended up having to run my hand
through the back of the case through the
i/o shield cut out propping it up and
lifting it out that way hopefully it's
just an isolated incident now while the
top glass panel looks really nice it
doesn't really do much functionally
maybe apart from keeping acoustics a
little bit more in check but if you're
gonna have the glass panel installed you
can't mount any fans any radiators
there's no ventilation at the top it's
simply just a slab of glass but if
that's not what you're about fractals
also included a mounting bracket and a
ventilation plate that you can swap out
with just four easy screws and that
gives you up to 360 or 280 millimeter
radiator support same as the front and a
fill port which is really nice if you're
doing custom water cooling and you have
a hard to reach reservoir it's going to
make that process potentially a lot
easier
now it's worth pointing out that when
the glass panels installed it actually
sits inside of a removable bracket where
the pre-installed LED strip is adhere to
with some like 3m adhesive unfortunately
you have to remove that bracket if you
plan to swap in the mounting bracket so
you kind of have to choose between LED
strip or fans and radiators at the top
of your case it would have been nice to
see a magnetic LED strip or at least
have it packaged separately inside of
the accessories box for more flexibility
at the back of the case we get a better
look at our fourth prism fan which you
can see is on flexible mounting strips
for either a 120 or 140 millimeter fan
you get 7 horizontal expansion slots and
two vertical ones in case you want to
mount a GPU vertically but that does
require that you purchase a PC riser
card separately at the very bottom you
get a removable power supply bracket
that does have captive thumb screws
hooray
now a final note about the power supply
dust filter that I showed earlier which
is really dust filter for the whole
bottom of the case because the bottom
can also support up to 240 millimeter
radiators is that while it pulls out
very easily
whoo I did have some trouble finding the
channels to actually get it slid back in
properly so I found it easier just to
put my head down and look for the the
grooves myself and get it in that way as
opposed to fishing around for it for a
minute or two that pretty much covers
the exterior of the case so let's talk
about the inside of it and what it's
like to build in the internal layout
here is pretty straightforward for
starters the motherboard goes in really
easy there's a race to understand off to
help with that process the case supports
up to e ATX motherboards but bear in
mind if you go that route you're gonna
partially cover up the cable grummons
that are on the right side however you
should still have plenty of room to pass
cables through there is a good number of
cable routing grommets in here they're
all placed in very smart locations and
they're large so you can easily pass
cables through all of them even the ones
at the bottom on the power supply shroud
and at no point did any of the rubber
pieces pop out of their cutouts when
passing cables through to the right of
the motherboard area you'll find a
relatively blank space that I've been
referring to as the reservoir all these
years ever since the original define s
came out that's because it's essentially
a mounting area for pump res combos that
you can kind of just stick to the wall
of the case looks really nice kind of
gives it a floating effect and you can
see they're mounting strips so you can
actually adjust the height of your unit
as well now you actually have an
alternative mounting location for your
pumper res on the power supply shroud
this is one of the smartest additions to
the s2 vision in my
opinion they still have the removable
cutout at the front of the case that you
can take out with three screws two of
which are behind the motherboard tray
one is underneath the front panel it's a
little tricky to get to but typically
you're only doing it once in a blue moon
but if you look closely you can see the
same mounting strips on the removable
tray as you see on the reservoir meaning
that you can actually mount the pumper
res straight to the power supplied
basement which is pretty cool also on
the removable plate you get a rubber
grommet for routing cables as well as
two holes for routing your water cooling
tubes which is super smart especially
considering that you can again support
radiators at the bottom of the case but
that's not all for this little plate no
you can actually mount an SSD tray to it
so there's actually three locations on
the power supply shroud now where you
can mount an SSD tray so apart from
having an SSD at the front of the case
you could also mount one smack-dab in
the middle or one more or less straight
over your power supply which is my least
favorite location because the cable
routing grommets just aren't very ideal
there's no grommets or cutouts that are
directly behind where the SSD would go
there so you'd have to kind of route it
either to the right or the left which
might not look as clean as time goes on
it seems like case manufacturers keep
trying to find new things to do with
their power supply shrouds to make them
more useful and more functional and I
think this is the smartest execution
that I've seen personally from a mid
tower case here in 2019 now just the
side note here I have a three hundred
and sixty millimeter radiator installed
at the top of the case that's from our
asus rog ryojun AIO
and i just wanted to point out that
there's still maybe about i just did a
measurement about an inch in
three-quarters of space for a radiator
assuming that you're just keeping the
front fans here you're not trying to do
push-pull or anything like that you
could probably fit around a forty 45
millimeter thick radiator at the front
whether it be two forty to eighty or
three sixty without running into any
clearance issues with this top radiator
here it's actually not too bad now the
backside of the case behind the
motherboard tray we have quite a bit
going on starting from the left side we
have three two and a half inch or three
and a half inch drive trays these are
primarily for hard drives mechanical
drives they are removable with a single
thumb screw and if you're not using them
you could remove them completely for a
ton more cable management room or you
can leave them installed for still a ton
more cable management room I almost kind
of like leaving them installed even if I
don't have any
I have to populate them because I can
shove the cables into them and have an
easier time closing the side panel when
all is said and done the trays also come
included with some rubber pieces for
reduced noise and vibration near the top
right in the middle you'll find our
Nexus 9 P pwm fan hub as the name
suggests this little hub supports up to
nine four pin PWM fans and I actually
have one two three four five six seven
seven fans all seven fans that are in
the system right now are connected to
that one hub and it is very quiet it's
keeping them at a relatively low rpm but
it definitely feels like there's air
moving through the system as well now
earlier I said the Prisma fans have two
cables coming off of them obviously one
of those cables you've just seen is a
four pin pwm connection the other cable
is a 3 pin addressable RGB connector but
it's actually two connectors because you
can daisy chain these fans together it's
such a simple but incredibly useful
feature that fractals come up with here
because you could just link them all
together and then have a single
connection that plugs right into your
motherboard RGB header of course it has
to be a three pin or you can plug it
into the single connector on the
included lighting controller never
having used the Prisma fans before I was
kind of apprehensive going into this
build thinking that I was gonna have to
spend a bunch of time linking up all
these RGB devices when in fact this was
one of the quickest and easiest setups
that I've seen the adjust r1 lighting
controller is pretty straight forward
I'm very happy that it's powered by SATA
and not molex that would suck
but it's pretty basic it doesn't have a
whole lot of different lighting effects
or modes I think there's probably like
six or seven if you want more
flexibility in that sense you should
probably plug it in straight to your
motherboard assuming that's an option
but you know it does the job it's small
and discreet it does have a magnetic
back so that you can actually stick it
anywhere to your case although it's a
fairly weak magnet so I could see any
stubborn cables back there giving it a
hard time and pushing it out of place to
the right of the fan controller you'll
find a very generously sized CPU cooler
cut out and just below that you'll find
the two pre-installed SSD trays these
are their default locations of course
like I said they can be moved to the
power supply shroud or a mix of both
they each have a single thumb screw and
two little feet that dig into the
mounting points to help them stay in
place to top things off you have a
couple sturdy velcro straps and about 15
or so tie-down points for making
everything nice and neat of course I
didn't spend a whole lot of time here
it's why it doesn't look quite as clean
as it could but with a little time I did
spend
it doesn't look half bad now this is a
relatively high-end case starting at 189
u.s. for the blackout version but
fortunately it's incredibly versatile
you can do pretty much anything you want
with it
it's very accommodating to custom water
coolers and enthusiasts alike seems like
a great environment to work in if you're
looking to build your next show rig or
simply just a system for your room
naturally there are a couple little
shortcomings that I pointed out but they
were mostly just nitpicks because of the
price you know the more expensive a case
is the more picky I'll get with little
things like captive thumb screws and
stuff like that but I think this case is
going to serve most people well assuming
that it ticks all the boxes for their
hardware requirements their aesthetic
preferences and so forth so that's what
I think of the fractal design define us
to vision RGB you guys let me know what
you think down below is it hot or is it
not thank you guys so much for watching
this video toss a like on it before you
go and get subscribed for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon have a
good one guys I will see you all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
