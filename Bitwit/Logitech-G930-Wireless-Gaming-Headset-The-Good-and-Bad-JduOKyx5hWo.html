card so hot
Fred look this feather everywhere oh my
gosh even has navigation in my list with
no remote you let me go all the way
across the country like to Norfolk hey
hey hey honey
well at least this thing is silent stop
talking
get out
introducing the node 202 from fractal
design it's cool compact and quiet check
the description below for more details
woods of gas so if you recall nearly two
months ago when I wall-mounted my
console over killer I briefly mentioned
that such an odd location for a PC could
stand to benefit from some wireless
peripherals so today I'll be taking a
quick look at the g930 wireless headset
from the folks over at Logitech now
while this pair of cans has been on the
market for quite some time now this is
my first opportunity to really test them
out so let's see if this wireless
headset is the right candidate for
reducing the console over killers' cable
clutter dilemma for starters the g930
connects to your PC via a USB adapter
over a 2.4 gigahertz wireless signal
while the adapter can be plugged into
your computer directly you also have the
option of plugging it into the included
charging dock for optimal placement on
your desk for example the dock plugs
into your computer with a 4-foot
retractable USB cord and sports a
slightly longer microUSB cable for
charging the headset which can be done
while the device is in use unfortunately
you have to unwind and rewind the
charging cable like a spool of yarn and
I would have liked to see a retractable
spring reel for easier accessibility
each charge gets you about 10 hours of
playtime so expect to juice up every
other day unless you're some kind of
filthy casual a combination of matte and
glossy plastic construction make for an
aesthetically pleasing headset for heads
of all shapes and sizes thanks to the
adjustable metallic headband spine and
swiveling ear cups oddly enough this is
also the feature I dislike the most
about this headset as the ear cups
swivel is the loosest I've seen making
them swing around frantically like Gumby
at a rock show or me in every video this
not only makes the headset feel
downright cheap but raises concern about
its ability to endure such frequent
jostling over time luckily for the g930
the foam padding in faux leather
stitching on the headband and ear cups
makes them comfortable enough to wear
for long gaming sessions on the left ear
cup you get a bendy noise cancelling
boom mic that stays muted in the upright
position and can be folded down when
you're ready to have a social life again
by the way in case you're wondering
here's how it sounds this is an audio
test using the built-in microphone on
the logitech g930 gaming wireless
headset as its
how do I send do I sound sexy yeah yeah
I know I do hold on let me type
something really quick get the keyboard
out hello my name is Kyle and I feel
really stupid right now because I'm
talking on the sale it's definitely not
the most crispy of headset mics and you
can clearly hear the clicks and clacks
of the Cherry MX brown switches on my
mechanical keyboard so plan on adjusting
the sensitivity settings in your voice
chat application before use also on the
left ear cup is your micro USB charging
port volume mute button and scroll wheel
and three programmable macro buttons
that can be configured in the Logitech
Gaming software the buttons are well
spaced out for my taste and large enough
to be easily located without
accidentally hitting the wrong one but
that's not all for the left ear cup as
you also get a power switch with a
wireless LED indicator and two switch
for Dolby 7.1 virtual surround sound for
more immersive gaming and movie watching
finally moving on to the right ear cup
you'll find nothing way to steal the
show left ear cup the right ear cup
works just as hard as you do switching
gears from the hardware one of the
biggest considerations of this headset
is its Wireless miss what it's a word
look it up well I'm happy to report that
the device works without a hitch up to
40 feet away from its adapter even
mucking about in the adjacent room with
the door closed seem to be a walk in the
park for our little headset
demonstrating its uncompromised signal
and range evety not a word
sadly the 40 millimeter drivers on this
puppy take a backseat when it comes to
sound quality music sounds flat and
uninspired and low-end bass is severely
lacking unless you turn up the Dolby
surround sound to 11 and while the
stylish design and things like macro
buttons make this headset appear like a
premium gaining product strip away those
some what gimmicky features and you're
left with an average headset pumping out
the same crappy gaming audio that
perpetuates the adverse stereotype it's
for this reason and several others I
mentioned that I personally can't give
the g930 my full recommendation the
gaming peripheral market is already
saturated with enough flashy headsets
that sound like hot garbage and with the
huge leaps forward that PC gamers have
been seeing in the visuals department
lately there's still a significant
dearth of headset options that bring
home the sound experience to match
fortunately I'll be taking a look at one
such worthy headset in my upcoming
wireless gaming peripherals roundup so
be sure to stay tuned for that
but let me know what you guys think of
this headset in the comments below and
forget to toss me a like on this video
