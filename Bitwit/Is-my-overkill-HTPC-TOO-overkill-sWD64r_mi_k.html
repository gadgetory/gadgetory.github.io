use an upgrade ooh
RGV and mechanical switches actually
their membrane switches with the tactile
click but what she doesn't know won't
hurt her
honey you must have spent a fortune not
even close
I'm not even mad at you for forgetting
our anniversary yesterday it's true I
did forget our anniversary but I more
than made up for it last night not even
close
the master set em s120 is the latest RGB
mem Kanaka keyboard and mouse combo from
coolermaster and for you lefties out
there you can also snag the MS 121 with
an ambidextrous mouse come October click
on the link in the description for more
info what's up guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well so
several weeks back I built an insane
htpc for wifey sauce and I that may very
well be too powerful for its own good
inside of the shift' mini ITX tower from
fantex is a liquid-cooled Intel Core i5
7600 K paired with an EVGA GTX 1080 Ti
for the win 3 amidst an all-star lineup
of other components needless to say I
received many complaints on the initial
video about building 2 overkill of a
home theater PC of which I am totally
guilty unless I decide of course to use
the rig not just for Netflix but some
epic gaming action as well sure our CPU
and GPU combo is capable of delivering a
smooth 4k experience but what about in
the confines of a mini ITX tower with
the footprint of a baby's ass my new
HTPC isn't special and just like any
other compact powerhouse heat and noise
are very real concerns so I spent a
whole lot of time playing GTA 5 at
different resolutions to test overall
system behavior back to that in a minute
though I first styled in an all core
overclock on our 7600 K to 4.8 gigahertz
at one point to 5 volts I could have
gone for the 5 gigahertz mark but
decided against it at the end of the day
as the gaming performance benefit wasn't
worth the additional heat incurred in
the case this size for our GPU I maxed
out the power limits and left the
temperature limit at 81 degrees Celsius
because anything hotter still makes me
kind of paranoid
seeing as how this is already a heavily
factory overclocked card a modest 50
megahertz offset was applied to the core
frequency with a 300 megahertz boost on
the memory clock after some stability
testing it was game time I'd call the
settings I chose aggressive and a good
showcase of how pretty GTA 5 can look on
PC msaa was disabled though since the
quality to performance trade-off just
isn't worth it in this title especially
at our target resolution of 4k we'll
work our way up to 4k eventually but
first let's have a look at our 1920 by
1080 experience circling around
Franklin's neighborhood our frame rate
hovered between 75 and 95 FPS with a
burnin benchmark score of 98 frames per
second on average while the game is
definitely playable GPU usage barely
topped 45% at times indicating a
prominent CPU bottleneck we saw a
sustained core clock frequency of
nineteen hundred and thirty six
megahertz with a memory clock speed just
over 5,800 megahertz
hardly breaking a sweat however allowed
our GT X 1080 Ti to stay relatively cool
at 69 degrees Celsius whereas the 7600 K
peaked at a respectable 74 degrees C at
these temperatures our system kept
whisper quiet and completely under my
acoustic radar turning up to 2560 by
1440 had little impact on our framerate
with a benchmark average of 97 fps and
slightly lower frame times even with a
ton more pixels to render them at 1080p
we're still CPU bound though GPU
utilization bumped up to around 55% GPU
core clock fell down slightly to
nineteen hundred and twenty four
megahertz and we saw the card heat up
slightly to 73 C note that our CPU
temperature seems indifferent to our
increasing GPU temps this is probably
since the AO radiator fan is pulling in
fresh air from the bottom of the case
and even if we had an air cooler on the
CPU the shifts multi chamber design
would likely limit CPU and GPU temps
from influencing one another at this
resolution the GPU fans make the system
slightly more audible but still a long
ways from being a nuisance at 4k we are
now rendering 125 percent more pixels
than we were at 1440p and 300% more than
at 1080 for the first time we see a
significant performance dropped to 87
FPS on average or about 11% slower than
the other resolutions that said it's
still a much smaller hit than what we
typically observe when scaling up to 4k
perhaps even more importantly gameplay
fluidity of
identical between our three resolutions
now a trained eye might have noticed the
lower frame rate but the only difference
I spotted was the image quality with 4k
taking the crown for Chris penis by a
landslide here at 4k we finally see the
system become GPU bound with eighty to
ninety nine percent utilization raising
temps to our fixed 81 degrees Celsius
limit which left the core clock jumping
around in the 1800 megahertz range CPU
thermals remained unfazed and continued
operating in the low to mid 70s now at
this point the tower of power was
bustling with more fan noise than before
but the least bit of ingame sound easily
drowned that out or at least made me
forget about it altogether making this
one of the quietest small form-factor
systems I built that's actually 4k ready
in every sense of the phrase having the
GPU fans facing inward and away from the
tempered glass side panel seemed to help
as well not to mention the radiator fan
doesn't emit much noise in its tucked
away location suffice to say our HTPC
has performed beyond my expectations in
the acoustics and thermals department
striking a delicate balance few systems
in its class ever achieve and while it's
certainly more than we'll ever need for
video streaming who knows what other
activities lie ahead with this much
horsepower in our living room hey honey
can you put in an order for a 4k TV
please okay thank you
oh and HDR better make it HDR okay yeah
i and OLED if you can find it OLED would
be okay gonna go down but that is gonna
do it for now guys before you go be sure
to toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it
you can also visit my store for cool
merch and feel free to check out bit
with Ultra might add free early access
channel for a buck fifty a month the
first two weeks are completely free and
you can back out any friggin time as
always I'm Howard bid with thank you
guys so much for watching subscribe to
the channel for more tech stuff if you
haven't already and I'll see y'all in
the next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
