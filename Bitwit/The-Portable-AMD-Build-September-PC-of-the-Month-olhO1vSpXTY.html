use an upgrade ooh
RGV and mechanical switches actually
their membrane switches with the tactile
click but what she doesn't know won't
hurt her
honey you must have spent a fortune not
even close
I'm not even mad at you for forgetting
our anniversary yesterday it's true I
did forget our anniversary but I more
than made up for it last night not even
close
the master set ms 120 is the latest RGB
mem Kanaka keyboard and mouse combo from
coolermaster and for you lefties out
there you can also snag the MS 121 with
an ambidextrous Mouse come October click
on the link in the description for more
info what's going on guys welcome back
to the channel hope you're all doing
well so today we are actually assembling
September's PC of the month which you
can see already a little preview of the
case we're gonna be using super exciting
this is actually going to be a mid to
high end fully blown AMD small
form-factor gaming PC we finally now
have the here in 2017 the the parts from
team red both on the CPU and GPU front
although GPU accessibility right now for
AMD is a bit debatable
that's topic for another video but we're
gonna be using an AMD CPU and GPU for
this build and it's gonna be all
encompassed or it's gonna be enclosed I
should say inside of a relatively
portable portal portal bull chassis and
that's gonna be C we were finally
exciting so let's go ahead and check it
out check out the parts come on let's go
oh we're here that was a really short
trip so today we'll be building inside
of the portal Mini ITX chassis from good
old BitFenix and if you guys haven't
seen this case yet it looks like
something straight out of the video game
it kind of looks like one of the little
robots that you interact with it's a
very fun looking case very unique the
internal layout is just as unique as the
exterior in my opinion as we'll take a
look at in just a bit it also comes in
some varieties you can get black or
white window non window I'm going with a
white windowed version so you can see
here the windows actually on top giving
you a look at your GPU the GPU actually
gets mounted across the you know depth
wise across the case with a PCIe riser
card I believe so that should be a
pretty interesting little feature and
I'm hoping that this goes smoothly the
we don't get too many headaches from
this from this from this little chassis
here but moving on we've got a CPU to
talk about we've got the risin 5 1600 a
fantastic chip that I have been using a
lot lately which is why you this is a
not a fresh and open box by any means
it's a great price performance chip from
AMD for about $200 it's absolutely
fantastic 6 cores 12 threads and of
course you get some great overclocking
capabilities with supported am4
motherboards like this as rock fatality
a be 350 gaming ITX AC I've actually
never used this board before pretty
excited to check it out
it's got some decent features here so
you've got an RGB LED header I don't
think we'll be using that today but it's
nice to have the option dual band 802
dot eleven AC Wi-Fi which is fantastic
for a mini ITX board some sound crap
that we don't really care about MTU nvme
support and Intel Gigabit Ethernet LAN
for about 125 bucks we're really ticking
all the boxes that I look for personally
when shopping around for a mini ITX
motherboard so excited to use that today
we're gonna be pairing that with a 16
gigabyte kit of Corsair Vengeance lpx
ddr4 at 3000 megahertz 16 gigabytes
should be plenty for our needs it's a
it's a great kit I've been using this
kit for for ages
I guess not too many ages because it's
ddr4 and it doesn't go that far back but
it has great compatibility with Verizon
platforms which I'm very excited about
as well we'll be able to hit 3,000
megahertz no problem I would I would
expect and we've also got some decent
storage options here so for our boot
drive we've got a 250 gig samsung 960
Evo m2 nvme SSD this is not quite as
snappy as the 960 Pro but we don't
really need the pro for gaming per se so
I think the Evo is gonna be just fine
I've got a stupid FAST controller and
stuff on it we've also got a one
terabyte WD black hard drive as a
mechanical drive of course and I thought
I was getting the three and a half inch
drive when I initially bought this but
you know this this showed up on my
doorstep so I guess it works though
because we do have multiple two and a
half inch drive slots in the portal and
going with a small form-factor theme I
guess it can't hurt to you know how some
smaller drives as well so one terabyte
should be plenty for our games and
finally we have the infamous ever so
evasive Radeon rx Vega 56
holy moly so yeah this is gonna be my
vega build i believe right at least at
least small form-factor for sure but
this is a fantastic little card that has
well it was destined to have great price
to performance based on the initial
price that AMD promised us and then with
all of the you know price gouging or
whatever you want to call it now this
card is going for about five hundred and
fifty dollars on new egg and amazon if
not more and it's also very hard to find
so this build sorry guys if you were
trying to part out this exact system
this might be the only part that you
have trouble acquiring and even for a
decent price you might have to overpay
if you really want one of these guys but
since I have it I'm gonna use it a lot
of you guys are noticing the RX Vega 64
that's just been chillin on top of the
RGB build in the background in my videos
saying Kyle why aren't you using that
Vega card it's just collecting dust
well I've this this one was collecting
dust too so I'm gonna use it today
I'm very excited to use it though it is
it is super fast for you know if it was
399 like AMD promised in us initially
then it's technically got a better price
to performance than the gtx 1070 just
ever so slightly but still and yeah i
guess we're gonna run some benchmarks to
see i'm very cute to see how it performs
with the the 1600 there so that should
be pretty cool too but those are pretty
much all the parts ladies and gentlemen
the total cost of this build comes to a
rabb a ston you know depending on what
you pay for the RX vega 56 you're
looking at anywhere from 1300 to about
$1500 for everything here so like i said
this is sort of on the cusp of you know
between mid tier and high-end gaming
system you guys can take your pick but
there you guys have it so without
further ado let's go ahead and start
piecing together this small form-factor
AMD gaming machine wait why am I doing
this I have employees now Heather you're
building a PC today
alright guys so wifey sauce has
completed the build took you and Chris
about oh about two hours two hours more
or less well well Chris had to film you
guys and he did that I'm sure he did a
fantastic job I'm sure yes he is a very
useful intern I shall use him use him in
multiple ways but head of the bill to go
overall it looks like it looks like it
went pretty smoothly hold on let me go
ahead and slide this guy out let's take
a look here take a quick gander okay you
got the yeah it looks like everything is
installed you there's no fundamental
parts missing I see a graphics card I
see a CPU and a cooler or I don't see
the CPU did you install the CPU okay
making sure so so I guess what's what
were you expecting going into this build
and and did reality meet your
expectations or not expect it to be that
difficult but the one thing that gave me
some trouble was the cable management
like since there's no like tie-down
spots or anything having to like figure
out how we're you know tie the cables
down this stuff was plentiful and it
doesn't look as clean as a normal adult
does because you can't tie down the
cables behind yes I could usually do so
that was a little frustrating putting
the cables in it was like it was pretty
tricky at one point
yeah the agent a pin for the CPU I just
could not reach down in there so I had
to take a zip tie and hold them together
in place so that I can use both hands
just put the two four pin connectors you
actually zip tied together in order to
sort of hit it back there without it
going all of its money there's no way
that's I've actually never had to do
that but it's good to know that that
works because I'm sure that there's
gonna be some point where it where I
needed to use that trick looks pretty
clean I mean all things considered yes
that's true there are no tie-down points
from what I can see behind the
motherboard tray although there's
probably not any room for cables back
there anyway I think just the way in
this case is designed since the windows
on top which pretty much only shows your
video card they probably weren't you
know twopence you can
heard about cable management on the
interior but it looks like for what you
were given you did a pretty decent job I
can see you stashed a lot of the excess
cabling inside of the drive cage because
there was only one drive that you had to
mount off of the motherboard right the
MTU goes on the motherboard and then you
had that one two and a half inch
mechanical drive why didn't you mount
that drive to this tray on on top it's
too big cage it was too big okay yeah so
I guess yeah you know generally the two
and a half inch SSD is slightly smaller
than a two and a half inch mechanical it
seems but overall looks pretty awesome
were there any like oh moments that
you ran into at any points along the
builds or yes that's an odd that's a
nodding of the other yes what there was
a big oh there was a big how
big of a was it so after I was done
after I was done you know assembling the
computer and I was like oh I'm done yeah
I can show Kyle uh-huh you know I had
you know when I was building I obviously
took this part of the case and I put it
off to the side and then I'm just
building in this part of the case right
yeah and the cables the front panel
connectors and cables were are connected
to this side so I had completely forgot
about plugging those in yep and so I had
it all assembled and you know how
difficult they are because they're so
tiny yeah and I like especially with a
small form-factor build it's yeah so I
wait I grab psycho I'm done yeah we can
see it all put together and I grab this
and I just looked at Chris and I was
like
looks like you got really lucky though
because it looks like other front panel
connectors are on the right it's gonna
say what saved me what you're not there
not being blocked by any of the other
components at all so it looks like you
just had to plug them in and tuck the
cables away so you got really lucky
there dodged a big big bullet but yeah I
guess that's something to consider is
that just the way this case works is
that you you sort of do all of your
building outside of the case entirely
and so you don't really realize that
there are front panel connectors
attached to the shell that still need to
get plugged in to the to the innards
here so look overall honey excellent job
Bravo high-five high-fives all around
and good job to you Chris I think I
think I think you do too I was wondering
what that donor was for and it it is for
eating that is now confirmed I will have
to have a bite of that after we shoot no
no thank you fellers for watching we
heard toss a like on the video if you
enjoyed it you can also check out the
little truck our ad free early access
channel for about 15 months first two
weeks are completely free you can back
out and I don't like doing videos with
donut in my mouth it tastes good but it
feels wrong I'm so conflicted right now
okay guys have a good one bye I</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
