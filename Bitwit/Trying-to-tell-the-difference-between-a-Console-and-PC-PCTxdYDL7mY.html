a little experiment on myself to see if
I can tell the difference between an
Xbox one X and the PC gaming experience
this idea came to me after Microsoft
dropped their November update for the
Xbox one which adds keyboard and mouse
support to select titles the first game
being fortnight which you wouldn't know
it because so far the keyboard and mouse
support for that game has been utter
baby diarrhea it's super bad and a lot
of people are speculating that it has
something to do with polling rate issue
but whatever it is it's probably gonna
have to get fixed with the future update
and that's the topic for another video
the other game however is warframe and
warframe is also a game that's supported
on multiple platforms and so far it
seems the game support for keyboard and
mouse on Xbox one has been far superior
to fortnight if not flawless so what
I've got set up over here is sort of a
gaming station with two sets of
identical peripherals you've got the
corsair k95 RGB platinum and the corsair
glaive RGB gaming mouse one side of
those peripherals is hooked up to an
Xbox one X and the other is hooked up to
a gaming PC as you can see both these
systems are behind this curtain here so
I cannot tell which of these peripherals
is connected to which platform so how
it's gonna work is I'm gonna go in the
other room and wipey sauce is gonna come
in here and scramble the peripherals
around so I don't know which is which
then I'm gonna come back in the room
play the game for a few minutes on each
platform before making an educated guess
as to which one was PC and which one was
console we're gonna repeat this whole
process of me leaving the room and
whyphy sauce scrambling the peripherals
around three times in a row just to help
us verify that I can actually
distinguish the difference between these
experiences as opposed to just making
lucky or unlucky guests now before we
dive in I want to touch on some things
about our setup here so we've got a 4k
60 Hertz monitor that we're gonna be
using for both console and PC you can
also see I've got some black electrical
tape in the lower right hand corner
that's because my copy of windows on
this gaming PC is not genuine so it pops
up that little stupid text there it says
activate Windows so I just cover that up
so it's not a complete dead giveaway now
as far as graphics and other settings
are concerned here with the PC version I
am running with vsync on and we've also
dumbed down all the quality settings to
low at the very lowest preset possible
even though warframe looks really good
on an Xbox one X it still is no match
for a PC and even at low settings it
still looks a little bit better and
crispier than console so what I also had
to do was actually scale down the
resolution on PC to 2560 by 1440 and
that way and only that way can we get
close to to what it looks like on
consoles sorry console gamers PC clearly
has the high ground when it comes to
but you already knew that so that's it
guys that's what we're doing today
should be kind of interesting hopefully
you guys enjoy it I'm ready for white
pea sauce to get in here and start
scrambling up those peripherals so we
can get round one underway
have you done your worst woman alright
I'm not even gonna look at the the menu
screen here heads down cuz just I don't
want to notice anything all right I'm
gonna hit escape and I'm gonna start
playing here we go use your power use
your power so I'm just gonna churn
through these guys really quick this is
the very beginning of the game as soon
as I kill these guys I'm gonna stop and
switch
alright keyboard and mouse seems pretty
fluid actually I don't think there's any
input lag now seems pretty seems pretty
solid actually graphics look pretty good
oh wait what oh how do I sorry guys I
don't know how to play this game alright
I kill all those guys so I'm gonna stop
and then hit escape I don't look at the
menu actively alright I'll be right back
whatever platform I was gaining on the
first time this is now the other one
okay this feels very very responsive
also little to no perceptible input lag
here I don't know if this looks quite as
crispy as the first one but if you're
just looking at keyboard and mouse
support they both feel really similar
it's tough it's actually pretty tough I
am guessing that this is an Xbox one X
and the first platform I played was PC
are you serious
No are you serious maybe I'm trying too
hard maybe I'm like looking at the I was
trying to look at the the quality of the
game I'm quite surprised I thought I had
it figured out huh shows you how much I
know let's do round two all right
my confidence is a little shaken at this
point I'm gonna have to pay extra close
attention here we go grab melee weapon
grab it grab it oh jeez
hello oh jeez oh what's going on why
can't I oh oh no oh yeah that's right I
turned melee targeting off for both
platforms that's why I stuck a little
bit more than usual
ah yeah Oh last guy alright that should
be good for now do you think all right
let's do this
yeah die you a son of a gun
come on I don't know I think I think
this looks a little better this looks a
little bit better than in the last one
well one thing's for sure I suck at this
game regardless of which platform I'm
playing it on how rude did okay I am
going to guess that the first platform
was console and that this platform is PC
final answer okay that's the sort of
talkative bounce more like it you know
was actually the graphics that gave it
away this time I think in round one I
couldn't tell because we were indoors
and I don't know I wasn't really paying
attention to the textures indoors as
much they weren't standing out to me but
as soon as I walked outside in round two
the foliage the detail the foliage on
the leaves and everything just looks so
much crispier on PC I knew immediately
that it couldn't be a console and even
this little blue orb thing has a lot
more detail on PC than on console
I just noticed that at the very end of
this run but keyboard and mouse
virtually identical across both
platforms both in how it feels and
functions let's do round three this will
be the tiebreaker here we go all right
this is looking pretty good looks pretty
good
I would I would bet money that I know I
know what this is which platform this is
do I have to fight this guy right now
no wait used use the melee weapon can
you stop that please ah okay I think
that should be good for this platform
final run this looks pretty good too ha
I should not have just bet money on the
last run cuz I I don't know now the six
is tricky I'm blocking you can't touch
this Danny something else that I just
noticed is it if you look at the draw
distance of the foliage right in front
of me and those plants disappear pretty
quickly I don't have to be very far away
from them for them to disappear I didn't
really notice that in the last run but I
also wasn't looking for it so now I'm
now unsure if it's platform-specific or
if that's just the game I don't know but
at any rate I think I think I'm out of
time here I think I have to make a call
so the first run I'm gonna say was
console and I'm gonna say this is PC
weird flex but okay alright cool um yeah
again it was it was definitely the the
foliage and just I think the graphics
overall you can definitely tell the
difference so I guess what we can tell
from this little test here is that even
at a dumbed-down resolution and lowest
possible graphic settings PC at least in
this game still looks better notably
better than consoles so much to the
point where I can repeatedly tell the
difference blindly now on the other hand
graphics were really the only thing that
I could use to distinguish between
console and PC meaning that the keyboard
and mouse experience was pretty
identical regardless of the platform I
was using this is great news if you're
looking to game on console especially
with all the cool exclusives that have
been coming out for it lately but you
want an alternative to a gamepad now
obviously this isn't a perfect solution
just yet it's still very much in its
infancy like I said before fortnight is
still a complete mess with keyboard and
mouse but at the
release this little demonstration gives
me some hope that we're seeing more of a
PC like experience being brought to
console now obviously we're still a long
way off here when it comes to frame
rates resolution graphical fidelity and
all that stuff
consoles still have a lot of catching up
to do but very least we can get by with
some keyboard and mouse action in a few
select titles on the Xbox one for now
but what do you guys think those of you
diehard PC gamers out there who aren't
already gaining with consoles would you
ever consider bringing an Xbox one or
ps4 into your gaming lifestyle if it
offered really good keyboard and mouse
support for exclusive titles that you
were interested in let me know in the
comments below I'm actually really
curious to hear your thoughts on this
one and you know since we're on the
topic here you know what pcs can do that
consoles can't build websites
specifically what Squarespace
you probably heard me talk about
Squarespace before but I'm going to tell
you again because I care about you what
I like about Squarespace is that it's
sort of this one-stop-shop for building
your online presence they hook you up
with a domain a simple UI to create a
one-of-a-kind website and a bunch of
marketing tools and analytics so you can
do good business eat things now
something tells me you're somewhat tech
savvy but should you run into any snags
along your site-building journey
Squarespace is 24/7 customer service is
pretty awesome
apart from live chat and email support
they also have live webinars and help
guides that are always available if
you're ready to start something great
make it with Squarespace head to
squarespace.com for a free trial and
when you're ready to launch go to
Squarespace comm slash bit wit for 10%
off your first purchase of a website or
domain that's gonna do it for now guys

good one
oh I almost was tripped over that tripod
this is a dangerous way to film okay I'm
gonna go now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
