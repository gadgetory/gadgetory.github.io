software that now features dynamic
lighting integration with far cry 5 for

pre take control of your hardware with
Corsair IQ you can click the link in the
description for more info what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel so
today I am putting together Mays PC of
the month and as per your request it's
going to be a risin - system a gaming PC
of course I took a poll on Twitter you
guys should follow me there if you
haven't yet but you guys all really want
to see it rising to build even though I
did one not too long ago so here you go
given the people what they want but it's
gonna be a pretty sweet system you can
see we've got a pretty much all-star
lineup of hardware here and I'm gonna go
down the parts fairly quickly so we can
get right into the building got some
nice b-roll montage for you guys today
so very excited to get that underway for
starters we have our chassis here which
is the fractal design mesh if I see in
white it's tempered glass edition of
course so I know that nasty acrylic or
solid paneling but I really like this
case because for one we're going with a
white and purple theme system today they
seem like a great case for that and
since we're sticking high-end components
in here I wanted to have a lot of fresh
air flow the mesh if I had just pure
mesh at the front of it so a lot of good
intake coming from coming out of this
chassis so happy to use that today I'm
just gonna go down line here in no
particular order we have the Asus prime
x4 70 Pro motherboard which is also
beautiful and white just below that you
can see we have a white CPU cooler this
is actually the deep cool captain 240 X
with RGB so yes it is a 240 millimeter
radiator a IO we have a
brand-spankin'-new nvme SSD from Samsung
that's their 970 Evo in a 256 gig
variety maybe we'll do some testing with
that in part two we shall see and then
up here you can see we have the AMD
Rison 720 700 X the eight core 16 thread
CPU that is of course second gen Rison
here we have a fractal design silence
series r2 case fan with some nice white
blades we're actually gonna be
populating this into the system into the
chassis replacing one of the existing
fans below that EVGA has provided us
with
one of their icx units the GTX ten atti
for the win three which is one hell of a
card it's smoking fast one of the
fastest cards on the market right now
and it's actually got the white shroud
on it so that'll match perfectly with
everything else we have a white kit of
vengeance LED ddr4 3200 speed memory
from Corsair that is a 2 by 8 gigabyte
kit and it's it's it's fast which which
risin will very much appreciate over
here we have an EVGA 750 watt g3 power
supply 80 plus gold certified modular
and all that jazz now to give ourselves
a little bit of accent lighting in this
case I've employed the cable mod wide
beam RGB LED kit which has a lot of
different colors and functions on it and
the LEDs are super bright so it should
do a nice job of illuminating all of our
Hardware here and obviously there aren't
many purple components on the market
right now without the help of LEDs which
is why I've also employed some of cable
mods Pro Series cables in this very nice
high-quality white black and purple
sleeving that I customized myself on
their configurator website so if you
guys want links to this or any of this
stuff for that matter you can find it in
the description below
but without further ado let's go ahead
and start building this 2nd gen rising
gaming PC 3 2 1 bill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
