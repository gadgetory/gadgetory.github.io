2016 is brought to you by need for seat
go to need for seat USA comp for the
ultimate gaming chair experience for
your desk in office and Corsair they
make good products and you should buy
them what's up guys welcome back to the
channels coverage of CES 2016 we are
here at the EVGA suite in the Bellagio
hotel I'm talking to Jacob how's it
going man it's going great
awesome it's going great for me too now
the first thing I noticed when I walked
in here was this ridiculously like
interesting looking case it's it's a
definitely different than anything you
guys have done before where did the
inspiration of this thing come from and
what exactly is new about it well
certainly the inspiration is to do
something different right and do
something that is kind of unique and we
really try to focus on the GPU cooling
so right in the front here we have 320
millimeter intake fans that directly
cool the GPUs and so compared to a
traditional full Tower chassis this
helps reduce the temperature by about 6
to 7 degrees Celsius on the GPUs is
there any is there gonna be any kind of
radiator support in here as well
yeah so actually right now we have a 360
radiator in here it can also support
another one in the front if you really
wanted to go crazy with the radiators
you could do that you could even perhaps
with another 120 millimeter back here
yeah so it has pretty flexible support
for radiators awesome no probably the
thing that stood out to me most about
this case is this little module going
down over here I can only assume this is
fan speed because there's a little sign
that says fan speed but I think there's
a bit more to it than that is that right
yeah so this is a fan controller so you
can adjust your intake fans really just
by pressing a few buttons here so we
just increased it to pretty much max
down and then you can adjust your
exhaust fans as well same kind of deal
there so yep has a built-in fan control
allows you to have full you know you can
tweak it to your heart's desire ticket
it's actually really cool that kind of
gives you an additional level of control
over the airflow in your case even in
terms of like whether whether or not you
want to have more positive or negative
air pressure based on you know dust
accumulation and performance thermals
and things like that you can really just
tailor it all from here you don't have
to deal with a clunky software it's just
straight built into the hardware yep
that's right and we even include fan
filters as well for dust accumulation as
well yeah absolutely very cool and then
the other thing that I wanted to point
out here is this water block
and this I mean this is an AI Oh what is
this this is new to me explain right so
this is a it's kind of a closed-loop
cooling solution but we call it an
upgrade of occlusal closed-loop cooling
I like it so every single module on here
graphics cards radiators each has a
quick disconnect connector on it so you
can actually add additional radiators
without draining the loop you can add
additional graphics cards so all these
four we have four-way SLI running plus a
CPU it's all on one closed loop so
cooling solution so in fact even while
it's running you know you can just
connect it add another you know we just
we just close the loop while it's
running but you know that's the beauty
of the closed loop cooling solution
that's pretty awesome and does a is
there a pump inside as a built-in
there's a pump in there's a pump in the
CPU and there's a pump in every single
GPU as well and so that's that's
definitely enough to push the water
through all of those different
components and there one more time
there's five pumps in this that's a lot
of pumps yeah I'm pumped up forgive me
so okay so when does this when does all
this stuff come out or is there a
disclosure in terms of price and
availability we're still fine-tuning
that in fact the case doesn't even have
a name yet it's a working name we're
still working on all the details
case will probably be in q2 q3 ish
timeframe water cooling solution will
probably be somewhere around there as
well awesome dude well thank you this
looks really promising so far and thanks
for sharing it with us today before I go
I want to give a huge shout out to both
of my sponsors for CES 2016 need for
