welcome back to another episode of stack
attack the ultimate 1v1 gaming showdown
where virtual combat meets real-life
challenges today I'll be going
head-to-head with the one and only Paul
from Paul's Hardware in a round of csgo
arms race Paul how are you feeling right
now good Kyle you're about to get
destroyed let's take a look at the rules
the rules of stack attack are simple
before the match begins four attack
cards are dealt randomly to each player
players can play their attacks on each
other at almost any time during the
match but only one attack per player can
be in effect at a time all attack cards
are single-use only the effects of some
attacks are time-based while others
expire once a challenge has been
completed once per match a player can
summon a stack attack by playing two
cards at once to deal a devastating
combo once the player in the lead is one
kill or point away from winning they'll
have to surrender all their unused
attack cards to the other player those
are the rules may the best player win
all right Paul so let's take a look at
our eight attack cards for today
starting with lame pad where for three
minutes the victim will have to use a
gamepad in xbox360 controller while
playing it's like a fate worse than
death
it really is next up we have jailbreak
so essentially you'll have to handcuff
yourself and you'll have to dig through
a giant bucket of packing peanuts to
find the single key to unlock yourself
before you can resume gaming just like
my time at Rikers that's what I was
going to say next up we have baby
monitor where you'll actually up the
game for another three minutes on a very
tiny five inch display there's no actual
babies involved right no that would be
illegal probably I'm not supposed to
let's move on sure next up we have
twister where for three minutes
anytime someone kills the other person
the victim they actually get to instruct
them with one twister move
the left leg on table or right hand over
left so things could get pretty mixed up
pretty good thing I'm flexible
that's true next we have sack lunch
where the victim is gonna have to wear a
paper bag over their head and eat three
snack items through the bag before they
can resume getting it's good thing I
came prepared to sack up stop this man
next up we have trigger-happy we're in
game you'll have to hold down your
trigger finger or the left mouse click
for the entire three minutes we'll
actually have some duct tape to help us
out with that should be pretty very
pretty rapid has to deal with that card
will be pretty triggered
why aren't you hot every single episode
come on move it on here we have desk is
lava so basically your keyboard and
mouse will not be able to touch the desk
for three minutes and you can't cheat by
just putting everything on a mousepad
for example they actually have to be
lifted off the desk how you actually go
about solving that problem is up to you
and finally we have hijack where the
attacker will get to essentially hijack
the other players spacebar and can mash
at any time they choose for three
minutes on that note let's go ahead and
have wifey sauce come out and deal out
the cards are you guys may the cards be
with us I don't know if I trust the
dealer here shuffle that was a bad deal
all right all right I'll reveal my hand
first all right so first up we've got
trigger-happy jailbreak twister and baby
monitor well I have desk is lava
hijack of course the sack lunch and the
lame pad Oh God it's pretty pretty
evenly stacked here okay so um I even
have two that have red text and two that
have black text so do I
I'm calling Illuminati on this one we
never have Heather deal again actually
before we start gaming I almost forgot
to mention that the loser for today will
have to sustain a horrible punishment
which includes wifey sauce having only
90 seconds to apply makeup on their face
they'll actually have to dress up in a
cheetah printed robe wear a fake mullet
and then actually go downstairs of our
building and interact with a pizza
delivery guy who has no idea what's
going on while we film the interaction
what's the punishment though all right
here we go Paul you ready I have to pee
but that will help me fair enough
let's do this three two one go charge
I'm looking forward to playing against
Paul today because he's better at video
games than my wife so I'm very much
looking forward to the challenge I'm
super excited to be here Kyle told me
that he's been doing this with his wife
for a really long time and he wanted to
try it with me
oh no you got first blood that's a bad
element I kind of did it Oh spawn of
Satan Wow how did you get me down to ten
health in that brief period of time I'm
gonna play this place card just slam it
down what is it it's low-fat Oh God all
right
common mistake and stack attack is to
wait too long to play your attack cards
so I'm leading off with lean pad okay I
don't even know what buttons are what
this is actually impossible this is the
worst attacks I've ever seen
oh my god one who yeah that's in pence
suck yeah well you got I figured I'd
have to be five inches away from your
face to kill you with this awful Oh God
oh all right
that's humiliating you know either shit
what is wrong with my phone wait what's
reload this thing has been sucking a
whole lot so I think it's about time I
retaliated
that's baby crap all right I'm gonna be
murdered all right this is very
challenging that's 1.4 gamepad oh that
was so look that was a whole tier I came
in so much way I'm supposed to go there
you go ah can't see anything
walking baby monitors awful I was
expecting baby monitor be a little bit
more forgiving just a smaller monitor
but this is actually a real pain in the
ass I can't even see where I'm aiming
where I hear you
well I killed you headshot - amazing
baby minor headshot yeah
okay gamepads done crap can smell the
fear
you better not be camping on that can't
think like that I can't see it's
horrible strategy bullshit camp until my
timer ends a liar I mean you should just
try to listen for me listen where I am
oh wow finally oh thanks for the tips
MLG okay weird the oh I can't be accused
of camping I'm definitely moving ah all
I needed was one shot testing that one
bullet is so close alright I gotta use
what was I using before
Jessica's lava I have a strategy for
this I'm gonna hold the keyboard up
vertically and then mouse on the side of
the keyboard
WASD down here mouse over here perfect
solution
ah I literally shot around your body I
can't like secondly I was wrong this was
a terrible idea
my time's up okay oh come on
yes oh that was damn I need a new
strategy here don't really know what to
do what okay
aha Oh what why aren't you yes yes why
wasn't it I'm looking at you and
shooting Oh God I don't know decided to
check oh shit I actually out tabbed out
okay
Oh oh no oh god no what windows lock key
stop it
hold on hold on let me know when you're
back no no you can that's my fault you
can you can kill me okay oh shit oh shit
no not console oh my god so bad oh my
god oh my god for Camping's it's okay oh
there we go
shit sugar happy sure oh no three
minutes three minutes and I just have to
constantly have to tape down yes so just
tape down your your left click really
that won't cause any issues
this attack is gonna succeed for two
reasons one I'll be able to tell exactly
where he is and two by the time I find
him he'll be out of ammo what if I run
out of ammo then you run out of ammo
okay you'll have to wait for me to kill
you hold on this just isn't working
stay down
Oh God
I can't reload oh no I'm a damn oh wait
no I can't reload I shut you somehow son
of a bitch all right I basically can't
do anything because I can't reload with
the what's that fire button holding this
is not a good thing to have but I can't
attack with it because that wouldn't be
all right do you have any here you
anything on you right now stack lunch Oh
God really
yes oh my god oh god really I can't do
anything all right that's a waste cuz
like I can't even
okay untape it untape it him and reload
I'll give you I'll give you the I'll
give you a pass on that shit okay okay
yeah all right it's not what it looks
like I'm Kerry are we going again mmm
hope Cal is enjoying his sack lunch meat
in tube form is always delicious also
it's a little challenging to try to type
the keyboard with your hands cover this
banana juice yeah
game on wave on so technically I have to
hold this down eating food through a bag
isn't something I would recommend
especially when the girth of the object
barely fits your mouth cold all right
this is acting funny with the whole
thing
but this time so complaining about them
or they'll be 15 I think I see how this
works so if I let go then it looks for
your load if I push the button back down
then it shoots once what done I'm sorry
what's going on over there
my mouth is traumatized I'm sure we can
discuss this in more detail after it
doesn't matter it's over yeah okay
reload Simon oh no shit oh what a shot
yeah cap Oh God oh my god so good with
that thing if you like
ya know yeah the two levels of scoping
miss on the sniper rifle kind of mess
with you oh my peripherals are all
sticky from that popsicle you must be
just following me walking in circles
come on
jailbreak oh no wait so I just have to
leave my dude here yep
and cut yourself okay this this will be
fun I'm actually somewhat prepared for
jailbreak I'm used to the fuzzy ones
though okay left my headphones on so I
can still hear Kyle killing me over and
over again the Heather and Chris were
actually testing out this attack
beforehand and it took them forever to
find the key so I think Paul's in
trouble found the key already are you
kidding me oh that's really hard that's
very well that moves back over here
I shouldn't even care about this other
one but I kind of don't want it on my
hands okay hello nasty oh you did that
way too quickly
yes
no I didn't mean that it's not button
shit - on top of the real ooze
wow this thing sprays oh my god
oh come on what what run right up to you
when you have a freaking hand cannon I
bet he is the spacebar my last play is
hijack which gives me control over
Kyle's spacebar useful but also
challenging because it forces me to take
my mind off of what I'm doing and also
makes his character jump around which
makes him harder to shoot I'm suspicious
why I got this one
there you go all right fine take
advantage of the Eric that I saved from
my oyster twister what do I so next time
I kill you I'll tell you what oh you
have to kill me all right why if you saw
us you get to take control of my space
bar now on behalf of all that's I
officially hit you both you're all
traitors just do a random look right now
oh come on oh wait okay so a right arm
over left Paul and okay part of the
twister attack is challenging oh come on
yes
all right left left foot on table good
luck with this one Paul tears to see if
you're as limber as the last time we
tried this I have to keep the other
thing at the same time yep all right
this is okay there tap when he's running
around but not when I'm shooting at him
Kyle just killed me a third time but
neglected to give me a twister command
but just to be fair I'm handling it
under the table that was okay oh my god
so close damn it
give me more tack cards no all right be
at level 16 now maybe that mean you only
need one more kill maybe bullshit oh you
mean you got it you got to use the knife
then they should keep that in mind you
only need one kill with a knife
yep
hey you then you didn't hit me you think
it me oh Jesus
scare the shit out of me
come on aah
any shots is good tea oh yeah oh my god
you're gonna get the knife - and it's
gonna be a showdown can you throw the
knife Oh No
so I ran out of ammo
did you really excited try the knife you
oh my god
dance dance dance dance ah I win I don't
want to say I lost more that I forgot to
win plus I get to put makeup on now so
kind of looking forward to that all
right
I thought we were gonna go over the
brands of the different makeup types and
stuff you can find links to all of these
are affiliate links in the description
is this all cruelty free no the only
person who is cruel against is you 90
seconds on the clock thank you
here we go your eyes are like what
flickering they're very sensitive don't
stab him you have 60 seconds oh that is
that is gorge
I feel pretty why can't you get ready

that isn't what I look like a clown
it's like for your amusement 20 seconds
come on you got a cake moron there it
almost looks natural on it come on 5 4 3
2 1
done Wow bad no it doesn't look
beautiful but we're not done yet we
still have to add a couple things here
go ahead and what this wasn't part of
the deal
oh it was they'll actually have to dress
up in a cheetah printed robe wear a fake
mullet before going downstairs of our
building confident ma csgo skills you're
like Steve from gamers Nexus Wow
that's insulting okay you get one bonus
beauty mark oh there's the Marilyn
Monroe right there now he's European but
I guess my problem is that I were a very
natural makeup so like it doesn't his
makeup doesn't stand out as much yeah
you kinda you kind of wear it well a
little too well and that's really the
trick to like good makeup is applying it
in a way that just seems like it's not
even there I think I got
you put that robe on yeah interesting
choice you've made for him okay great
I'll see you in the lobby thank you
bye-bye
is he like pulling up I think I think
he's here should I go downstairs yeah we
just go downstairs now he said he's
gonna meet us a little early meet you in
the lobby I'm a little nervous I'm
feeling awkward but imagine how the guy
feels it's true he doesn't even know
he's gonna feel probably feels much more
oxidant than I do he probably does I'm
gonna go downstairs I hope he doesn't
have a Taser do you have a delivery is
it a chicken sandwich it's a chicken
burrito
yes yes okay the the payment was for
Kyle I have his credit card okay there
you go already swiped okay yeah oh this
is for you oh thank you thank you very
much have a good day yeah very much
looking forward to this burrito burrito
we had the upgrade from pizza to a
burrito because all the pizza places had
really long wait times today I'm gonna
sample a bite so chicken burrito you
