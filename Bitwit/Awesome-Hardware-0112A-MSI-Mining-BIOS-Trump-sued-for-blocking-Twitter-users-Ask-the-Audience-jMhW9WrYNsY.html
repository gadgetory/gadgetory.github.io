they've done so maybe they did it so
much that they got bored of it and that
guy said a lot of young people are tired
of that that's prime day that's true
which is in 7-eleven or both prime
numbers I think that's part of the I
mean there's there's quite a few options
they have in the low digits there but
astute observation at all oh that's not
mine mmm
someone else that's it I didn't you were
smart so one second oh you're right I
made it up I gave Amazon the idea the
Gammons that I do that prime day and the
days it's prime numbers and then I
bought the company they cool all right
so I think we have warmed up long enough
and we are now streaming to both twitch
and YouTube so welcome everyone this is
awesome hardware episode 112 you're
watching side a this is a show that Paul
and I do every single Tuesday at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time right here on twitch
TV and our respective YouTube channels
so in about an hour or so we're gonna
switch over to Paul's channel
youtube.com slash Paul's hardware to
continue on with side B of the show I'm
gonna go ahead and sounds my phone like
a good host there we go and so forth so
um no we didn't Fred I'm sorry Oh Kyle
Kyle was gonna pick that up on the way
over hey that was yours I was tasked
with that I got the beer okay
uh you're fair enough fair enough no I
said we don't we totally we both totally
blanked in the past I completely forgot
about the price but I'm sorry there's
anything else maybe I don't know there's
anything else you can think of for for
the end of the show troll like you
usually do Fred let us know else I'll
see what can be if we fail to miss or if
we fail to catch it maybe you can run it
by sell and sell can give us a heads up
but at any rate this is a tech show
mostly we talk about tech news mostly we
also like to dabble in things like plan
playing games against each other and the
loser do something stupid which we will
be doing on my half the show we also
occasionally like to
you which will be doing on Paul's half
of the show with his very popular sword
fight segment some Hot Topic
controversial issues we'll be discussing
and plenty of stories to go along with
it
so for starters why don't you buy
something from us obviously that's the
good idea that's okay all right I'm
talking along as well buy stuff bit with
Doc tete bit with tech slash store as my
merchandise store buy a glass the
glasses are now Paul sighs they used to
be smaller than this they were like
16-ounce but now they are full pint size
or 20 ounce glasses they AR they are
manly men glasses so you should those
super manly by those flasher shirts is
back in stock
everything should be more or less in
stock depending on the sizes
Paul store is Paul's hardware net get
off your phone it's very rude
I'm sure I'm trying to make an
arrangement oh okay yeah that's good so
you can buy a lovely pint glass right
yeah my store popular buy stuff he's got
women's shirts which I do not so if
you're a woman of culture story craze
about the clothes event some classes get
some damn glasses the glasses are
selling like hotcakes
buy stuff during the show william
johnson at you yeah buy stuff together
it will get shipped together girl
shipping discount or refund you get a
refund on some of the shipping and
cheers yeah it's true cheers Cheers the
drinking Fat Tire Prost Prost kanpai
come by I only know two years in one
language I'm trying to learn more it
makes me feel cosmopolitan is that
something you want to feel that way just
came out just came out here I'm shoes
okay you know this is what the show is
about is being honest
sharing our deepest thoughts and desires
you're right with the fans here I'm glad
that you can be so open with us so let's
start off with pin my PC we're gonna
switch things at the bit today instead
of we usually don't start the show with
this segment but I just thought let's
just break right into it especially
because we're about 15 minutes late
because I was stuck in traffic and left
too late then my PC is a segments most
of you are familiar with but for those
of you who aren't brought to you by
yes toy commuter no it was a proud
sponsor of this segment and that we
asked him if Toyota sponsored fit my PC
one day no reason at all one day we'll
get him on board but yeah you guys tweet
in your pictures of your PC's and Paul
and I help you critique them and stuff
but most of you we ignore yeah yeah most
yes yeah so sorry if you're not on this
list it's very short so I mean I don't
want to start this out on a negative
most of the people send pictures we just
we don't want to end it on a negative
tone so I started yeah it's like a
band-aid will do it alright so in case
TK freefall take your submission from TK
with an i5 44:30 Intel processor with an
MSI h87 motherboard 24 gigs of HyperX
rant twatting figure there and what do
we got 1016 GTS 1060 Benjy takes 1060 is
worth a whole lot more now than you put
wooden you probably bought it yeah
to Samsung Evo SSDs in the back and some
hard drives look at that big ol wait is
that it not to a fan on a hyper 212 yeah
or okay I think so nothing wrong with
that yeah this one thing is up this way
about that how much does a 44 it's
probably 430 go for trying to make an
equivalency of how much I don't know all
right
between one and two hundred we can
assume there's intake fans I'm jadon
they have no reason to believe that but
I'm gonna assume that there's also
Noctua intake fans and not two of fans
are probably the most expensive part of
this no that's not recommended sixty
whisper from the ten sixty which is yeah
that but that's only because you've
isolated prices due to the theory of
course or are they more on that I might
have indeed I was gonna say nice nice
little segue there good plug so freefall
I'm thinking the Noctua fans here
obviously yeah it's hard to match other
mainstream components with these fans
just because of their unique brown
two-tone color scheme but they do
perform like champions and I'm sure you
got a lot of healthy air flow going
through that case so I'm not gonna fault
you on that I will say if you wanted to
and just kind of make things more
cohesive you could paint them you could
do a little DIY project and paint fans
are like one of the easiest things to
paint really and they dry super-quick
and
and it honestly it should not affect the
performance much at all it'll be a
negligible amount of difference if any
at all you'd really have to have some
some really like robust measuring tools
to even pick up any sort of performance
difference in terms of airflow has any
FM I don't think you should paint them I
like them um Paul likes them
so if you like if you agree with Paul
then you should not paint them you could
you could or you could paint them black
and blue
they look pretty sweet I don't know your
cable management looks pretty good from
from this thing you got they get the
functional set up for the drives down
here with the plugs here at the front so
they can be unplugged and swapped the
drives without accessing the rear panel
which I respect that as well I feel like
for being such a functional system it's
pretty look good looking yeah yeah it's
very handsome no the cabling is pretty
tight in there but yeah um color yko
scheme wise you're not gonna get any
help unless you swap those fans power
supply sticker you could remove or paint
them like house it you get the
industrial caddy not too industrial for
fans actually they're pretty cool
they're pretty you're right gallant the
serving gallant I think I'm pronouncing
that wrong gallant Circle Circle okay
pause that circle to circle so go to
there is that an original h100 of course
area 20 is it that's what that is right
is that a Nimbus 3000 is that a giant
dildo no he's gonna beg yet okay sorry
alright so I like the I like the glass
tabletop here I'm gonna point start off
by pointing that out it's a bold move
tempered glass is always yeah is always
appreciated honey and it allows you to
to realize that the wood paneling covers
the entire wall going down to the floor
it's not just one of those slipshod jobs
where they put it up on the top part and
they have a little you know chair or
something like that it could be a
reflection that could be this could be
lbs I'm just it's all illusion I'm
trying to go off on a tangent happy to
talk about anything but the PC
what's the box of cookies oh yeah so
let's let's just take a look at his desk
actually let's just review his desk
honestly like you're the item management
on your desk semi-sweet semi string
drinking chocolate mix oh it's chocolate
it's this not they're not cookies it's
hot chocolate why would you want it to
be semi sweet though how would you just
want it fully sweet I don't know I mean
calorie option are you said I want to go
overboard with certain things I guess so
hopefully you don't have diabetes maybe
maybe you can we get out can we get down
to the circumcised buddy can we ask
somebody in chat a little screen cap
here and a scan of this barcode I want
to see yeah someone current going prices
your phone taking over that or the boss
to semi Shoplet mix nutrition facts
evidence why so clearly here we can see
that there's been some recent building
going on with a molex connector as well
as some it's a red some screws on the
table red cloth here microfiber looks
like heels Little Red Riding Hood for
wiping the system down the Jews drag it
looks like the LCD here still has the
protective plastic across the front of
it is that is that no that's just really
marked up with fingerprints I think just
fingerprints are you sure yeah I feel
like that's just these motor Suites that
yeah I guess that motors too old to
still have the plastic on it be curling
at the edges we'd be able to see it peel
and and stuff okay so basically we want
to say here's give the monitor a wipe
down probably use this red cloth here
right we need we need some more
information on the it's not chocolate
mix here and congrats on the Nimbus 3000
that's a pretty baller stick it is broom
broom stick edit is the broom stick
alright thanks for sending that one in
make you you know instead we've got
David David died sorry for
mispronouncing your new horizons 7 built
resin 7 with a 1700 okay that's a m4 8
cores in there and you've got 10 a
snooze prime X 370 motherboard 16 gigs
of g.skill ripjaws 5 and the GTX I'm
sorry an Rx 488 gigabyte model with an
accelerometer plus cooler so yeah when I
first I was like that's not an Rx for
Eddy but you've got an aftermarket
cooler on there from Exelero
that's kind of nice that is a sure liner
I'm familiar with that I mean if you're
going with reference you're gonna be
getting
lower temp effects look how look how far
away it is from the PCP it was floating
there is this one of the ones marked it
has the fan option like you have the
option to put hundred and twenty
millimeter fan under here I think it's
probably got heat pipes that wrap around
I'm guessing but so he's just using it
in passive mode right no no here damn
there is a fan so it's just it's just
slightly lifted off of the PCB I guess
interested there's no other close up I'd
really like a shot just directly from
the side of that to see how it connects
to the graphic skirt it would be cool if
they'd allow you to put another fan up
on that side of the heatsink cuz there's
so much empty space it looks like oh
yeah but pretty pretty clean looking
system I would say the RAM sticks out it
doesn't look bad but it's the only thing
that's read in your system you could
spray paint it white or something I
don't think brick gels 5 comes in white
again has black gray why doesn't g.skill
do white memory I don't know I mean they
have they have white accents on their
tread in Xenia they don't have any
figure Galax and Corsair have that
market wrapped up I guess yeah all right
so everything else is pretty good yeah I
mean III I like the difference
cooler style here you got going I don't
know I mean cable extensions always make
things look a little bit better if you
want this one kind of stands out a
little bit but overall everything's
super clean as far as your cable
management goes and yeah that's a unique
little build cool I like it it's an it's
a risin so yeah we have to give you
props for actually well I mean I can't
assume you don't do mining but I mean
you have an R X 480 you haven't sold it
for mining so there you go you don't
have like five more video cards in there
well jefe yeah this is is this your
friend no no okay not to mine all right
this is a kind of an old-school build an
IV bridge i 534 70 and a Susy 77
motherboard with a gtx 1050 TI graphics
card corsair 16 gig kit of ddr3 and h
105 all-in-one cooler which is mounted
on the front here as an intake a CX 500
power supply
fans okay I get is it corsair fans of
corsair for the memory the all-in-one
the the yeah one terabyte hard drive -
120 gig SSD is it fast 340 build from
2013
looks like yesterday 40 yes that is an S
340 for sure it's got the it's got the
bar here it's 340 such a good case like
this is this is purely like a budget
system for the most part but just having
that like billing inside of the s3 for
just makes it look so much more premium
for some reason this system free date
was this when did the s340 come out I
feel like while if this was built in
2013 mmm-hmm when did when did Ivy
Bridge come out every Bridge was ready
for Sandy 2012 that's 2012 2013 so yeah
I'm wondering I wonder when that's 3:40
actually came out I would I would
speculate depending on the timing that
this build was trance trance furred into
this case but I yeah I could totally be
wrong about that maybe it came out in
2013 that's not maybe this was one of
the original s3 40s the first the first
one maybe this was the first s340 it's
like a relic and it's worth more than
some NZXT NZXT employee watching right
now who's recognized some like you know
embedded this is a giant watch the first
341 it's just engraved in broad daylight
alright so yeah you say help but like
there's no we there's no help we can
give you pretty good because honestly
there's nothing you can do as far as
wreak abling or anything like that just
all you got to do is buy a new core
hardware you have a you have a lot I
mean your SSD arrays is nice you got a
nice all-in-one cooler you know you just
need to upgrade your CPU motherboard a
memory so you get some ddr4 in there and
then you know even you can even stick
with your 1050 Ti for a little bit you
know as well you know consider dropping
a rise and built into here something
like that that would be be a nice jump
up and gilligan black/red motherboard to
match all the other stuff you got or
honestly I mean like if like like we
said it's super clean as far as your
cable management and everything goes so
just just keep using this system and
gaming at 1080 and you're probably
having a good time
yeah and you got a nice build so don't
worry but don't worry too much better
Jeff good job we've got last one we've
got
Coco Killa well that's is that the one
that didn't load up no I added added one
you've made a change
I felt bad I felt bad and the first link
we used was broken so I found a new
submission from Coco killer yes
Roseville cases arise issues prime 270-a
oh sorry Gigi X 1080 TI and a 7700 K I
like the color scheme kind of hotline
ish yeah this is a top end as far as
like your gaming capabilities go
definitely got an optical drive in there
e props but it does look hideous
compared to everything else that is what
stands out to me the most in this thing
work on first look I like this hold on
we got we got some more I don't want
some more to talk about here
that's yeah right in here what is this
this that's probably from this from the
pump or no that's a fan cable this is
man it's well there's one from the fan
coming right here and there's another
one from the pump and this might be a
pump this might actually be the putter
plug the pump header plugs on this
horrible but it's not the best place for
it you just you got to do something
about these cables you can wrap them up
a little bit tighter yeah you can try to
tuck it down here too you know tuck that
one down away in there just so it barely
comes over yeah don't let those yes if
you sort of train them doable flex and
the little bend to your well eventually
wrap that one around and you know you
can I've looped it around yeah these
little be elective as well if you need
to like get rid of just a little bit of
slack in it or something like that
and then hey those who is is an
immediate thing that makes me think hey
ek just came out with those MDOT - oh
yeah heat sinks that would make this
look a lot better and maybe even
function I don't know what I don't know
what drive that is but maybe
functionally cool it down a little bit
I'm sure there's other options too but I
know UK just came out though so that's
what comes to my account the PC cables
like they just there I've met
convertible or something with I mean if
you got cable combs on him so there and
I lined up the 24 pin looks good
yeah these just need a slight I don't
know they look a little they're too far
away from each other maybe maybe yeah
like group them together right yeah
put them a little closer together and
have them both go in a nice swoop if
they need yeah they need to be a nice
even light Clark from from where they
come out just you know curving back and
then going into the waiting receptacle
of for the opening for the rear
motherboard painting receptacle yeah I
don't know I'm trying to trying to be
poetic here finally your HD audio do you
ever plug in headphones to your front
panel audio just think about it do you
if you do that's fine no no that your
audio experience probably isn't going to
be exactly the same as it is going in
through the back and considered just
completely unplugging this or wrapping
it or something like that yeah but
overall yeah I mean do a few of those
things and I think you'd be like wow
Darren's by sticker yeah power supply
sticker I mean I don't like it I'm like
okay I'm having specks visible like this
in my system here that's like it alright
thanks Coco because I'm because I'm
redoing Arctic Panther yeah and I'm just
reusing the fractal power supply I'm
leaving it as is but it's just the
fractal logo see that's fine it's fairly
classy I have no I love that it's very
minimalist Scandinavian okay yeah
alrighty next up is a fun a fun little
segment called ask Chat Chat Chat ask
check that's you guys so in this segment
Paul and I basically we tackle three
hard-hitting questions that you guys the
audience will be answering in a poll
that will be administering in chat and
Paulette I will have to guess what's the
most popular answer is going to be based
on your responses of course and we're
gonna do three of them like I said and
Paul and I we're gonna have to basically
take a drink I'd say take a big swig of
our beer as it stands for every answer
we get incorrect for every question that
we that we lose all right so this is
exciting this is super exciting and
because it is Amazon Prime day good ol
7-eleven I thought we would start off
this segment by asking our audience here
which one of them are Prime members so
we're gonna have to determine Paulo
you're gonna just sent a net neutrality
email he sent a net new tweet which just
sentence which is participating in the
net neutrality stuff tomorrow net
neutrality day oh yeah they have action
tomorrow July 12th twitch is
participating they just sent the email
out to creators letting people know
about it especially because it's an
international site this is mostly a
us-based issue does that mean twitch
will be down tomorrow no not down like
nothing's gonna be down they're not I
don't know for my understanding there's
no services that are gonna shut off
completely they're basically gonna be
having information out that says hey if
your internet service provider had the
ability to pick and choose who got
preferential treatment then you might
have this experience on our website
rather than others yeah yeah we're slow
yeah it's an awareness thing and yeah so
stuff still gonna work but it's just
it's just to try to get better messaging
out for people who don't understand it
completely everything yeah well we
talked about this a little bit more on
my half of the show but um yeah you'll
be talking about all like the real
important issues on Paul's half and I'm
really which is bad it's bad too because
we'll have been drinking more and it's
you're not the good time in the show to
talk about anything that's remotely
serious but we'll see how that goes well
we'll see how it goes yep porn that porn
I was participating all right so I ain't
no more I haven't linked any of these in
chat did you I just I just posted the
first one host of the first one we can
take a look at are you an Amazon Prime
member oh and the answers are either the
options are yes or no obviously so Paul
you and I have to determine and do you
have we have to guess with a percentage
and do you have my affiliate code but we
can't save it anymore not that bad
things will happen they didn't nobody
use our affiliate codes we don't
encourage that
it's a bad definitely not I mean unless
you're cool I'm not gonna stop you um
all right so we have to guess what
percentage of our audience is a prime
member okay so I would say the number
has to be divisible by 10 or just today
5 has to be divisible by 5 does it have
to be a prime number
uh no does not know oh yeah you know
what you want to do that it'll be fun
we'll make it we'll make it a prime
number then no yeah I know I know what I
can throw I think I can throw one out
there one one percent of already ok
prime numbers prime no I mean isn't it
easy to know what the prime number is
just be like is that divisible by
anything I mean the ones below a hundred
they get more and more difficult to
determine what they are the higher the
the larger the number is you're sure
about there's bounties out there for
discovering more prime numbers beyond
what we already know because they'd be
used in and in 4 for X I prefer cyber
security and stuff I'm using a generic
term because I can't think of the proper
ones alright alright so we're gonna do
use a prime number
alright oh the one I was thinking of it
wasn't even a prime number always good
that's definitely not a present good
alright so how about this just so we
can't like undercut each other why don't
we both say out loud on the count of
three what number we want okay okay
sound fair yeah okay let me let me just
pick a number really quick
okay I think I've got it are you ready
yes on the count of three we're gonna
see her it's gonna go it's gonna go like
this it's gonna go one two three number
it's 1 2 3 shoot
yep okay here we go 1 2 3 31 wow really
71 I was thinking it was pretty high Wow
I mean it'll be interesting I said 31%
Paul said 71% okay let's see both side
members yep I don't know all right maybe
you're right I was probably high and I'm
interesting you could be totally right
though because everyone I know has Prime
and I'm just thinking how long do we
wait here how much time do we give it I
think we've given a fair enough let's
introduce the next question right the
next question is so what
sit tight on that the next question that
we have for you getting if you haven't
voted yet on that first question so you
guys have to answer this next which
color of mechanical Cherry MX which is
your favorite so I'm gonna post this
this is not an exhaustive list
yes no it's not this is not an
exhaustive list I want it I want to keep
so basically which one do you like the
best out of the options provided okay I
didn't want to list all of them cuz
there is just there's just too many and
that keeps there's so many special
little sub sub switches and exactly so
sorry if your absolute favorites which
isn't represented here this is just to
keep things moving along but all right
let's let's see the results while you
guys are answering that let's see what
you guys what were our numbers again 70
what I said 31 and you said 71 okay okay
see what we got
oh you were way closer than I was I was
super close dang 60 I was for me was
between 71 and 69 or 67 sorry 67 69 I
prize damn it both 16 you know if it was
alright you have to drink your beer I
have to drink up I don't know that song
I feel like I don't even know you get
here but I thought none of you had Prime
you all up front I just I don't know I
mean I think it's becoming they they're
making it a lot easier to get into and
like that's enough yeah isn't Prime
membership like that there's a discount
that today or something like that I'm
not even
oh I just can't unknow a Prime
membership maybe perhaps not sure you
would think great okay so which Cherry
MX mechanical switch do you like best
do you want to go first or me um you go
first
well I'm just gonna choose the one I
like this that's what I was gonna do
which is which is Browns I like Browns
to have my personal I chose Browns yeah
I'm gonna I'm gonna I think you have one
good choice here that's gonna be a
contender yeah I agree I think it's
gonna have to be no words you get I know
but like right now we have my conscious
because right now we have this in this
and we're looking at the other ones do
it MX red I'm gonna say MX red red yeah
that's yeah reds and browns I think are
the most popular yeah um again we'll
give you guys a couple more moments to
vote here and we will go and onto the
third question question which is this
one right here who would win this is a
very serious question take it seriously
guys no laughing who would win in a hot
dog eating contest all right and then
drops them in there drop some in there
oh geez we got some ideas I didn't look
at this I didn't know you put nori in
here and yet norian hero and also
Guinness world record holding
competitive eater to Kira Kobayashi okay
he is in the running all right for this
are we are we going for a second are we
like yeah we're going for a second base
where is it between him and Hiro cuz I
mean yeah he's done here's a large a
large dog we're gonna burn I don't know
what the usual typical rules are for hot
dog eating contest either like this I
know there's a set time period of time
is it like five I don't I don't how much
time they have or whatever I think
sometimes it's I just know how about you
I know they dip them in water yet I make
the bread soggy that's not totally and
it's not just how many can you eat and
whatever cuz you can implement oh yeah
there's a time limit yeah so it's like
okay you have 30 minutes how many hot
dogs can you eat in 30 minutes 30
minutes I think it's faster than that
it's like a 5-minute Anderson I'm sure I
do not know what the official rules are
so that's a no nothing about competitive
eating
neither do you we're in the dark here
that would be good information
um so no I'm just saying if if I had
you're right if I had looked at this
more closely I would have done we
actually research - anything we talked
about on this show we do research we
read you're right
read most of the articles usually yeah
at least least all right
I guess what somebody said 12 minutes
and someone said 10 okay
and it's twitch chat so you know it's my
that's always my number one source and
creation those are probably two of the
foremost officials on hot dog-eating
HUBO who have a like a very
long-standing feud of course as far as
what the time limit should be yes we go
into the backstory but right right now
my and my senior thesis paper in the
bibliography just said twitch chat can
you cite like it sweet like you can say
to tweet right yeah especially if it's a
man that has a direct URL which exactly
what Twitter so I'd be the most
especially if it's a verified user
oh yeah that's verified and it's every
doing everything is everything they say
is correct
Wow sorry we have to go back to the
Renaissance which is where the switches
let's see what's the most popular switch
is brown you win again so close right
loose look at that technically blue
slightly and the leaves got three more
votes but still 28% twenty-eight point
whatever more percent our blues and
blues and Red's are both clicky no red
Turner grids are not I'm sorry
so brands it some people Wow and yes
don't have the tactile read son of that
Baloo do that a little brown deal
all right so blues blues right up there
alright so for people who like the
clicky
that was gonna be my next choice when
you go for blue yeah blue would
definitely have been third option there
in the fuse and a few folks in there for
the silver and the green green
how can you type on there so stiff they
really are they're very for heavy
handedness after a workout it's a finger
workout I type with my elbow or is it
like you get used to it
you work out on the greens and then it's
like I'm gonna type on another keyboard
then will you go to do the competitive
typing you type I'm like like Browns or
Reds or something probably like tickle
Oh always training with it so you can
like type like five times as fast yeah
what's that let that chamber that they
trained in in Dragon Ball Z where it's
like like 20 times the gravity so they
just like way down but they do all their
training in there and finally when they
get out of it they're just like way
faster because they've been training
this like bog down environment the whole
time I only have the vaguest like
knowledge of what you're talking about
so I definitely don't know what the
chamber is cool it's probably a little
bit more anime nerd even for me yeah and
a coke chamber maybe that's it I don't
know who knows anyway your chaya said it
out very soon I'm gonna take I'm gonna
take my my do drink here oh yeah I'm two
for two two for two damn it two for two
kicking ass and ass chat well look
chamber maybe alright so last question
of course is the hotdog eating contest
so we can't choose I'm gonna say we
can't choose the the world record
holders okay so that makes sense we're
going for second place here I'm gonna
choose hero I'm gonna cop out and choose
hero because I lost the last two rounds
I have a feeling hero's gonna be the
fast and he would be he would beat
everyone he'd probably beat Takeru
Kobayashi if they were allowed to
compete in the same it's difficult to
say because this is the thing like here
would get full if it's really 10 minutes
at 12 minutes he would get full and then
but I'm talking realistically here so
obviously you know I can't choose
Guinness Book World world record holder
Takeru Kobayashi or nori any insight or
hero I don't choose me because just
physically I'm the largest I'm the fat
one you are the you are the you have the
most mass well he's been the fat one
most most mass equals more hotdogs to be
in jest yes or at least that's what you
would expect logic inside that's that's
yeah that's what people would logically
assume yeah I know it might not even be
completely true that's true like if you
just had a picture of like which of
these circles would eat the most hot
dogs and I'd pick the biggest circle
like without any other specifications
just the biggest one yeah the biggest
biggest one that really dates or the
most but like like Jay for example we've
even been out to eat with Jay he's like
a bird doesn't
barely eats yeah you should be an erect
like now they might say yeah but you
know I don't know maybe it would since
he does so much working out maybe I
don't know if that's changed his
appetite at all but I know like that was
one of the things things I was that was
like about jazz I keep yeah
he barely it's food I know you know I
was like Are you ill do you have a
condition all right let's see what the
results are
let's go hero hero actually beat out the
Guinness world record holding
competitive eater that boy hero
Kobayashi up here it's like awkwardly
passed out kind of half on you boy you
just looked over it exact a woke up from
his slumber why are you alright get me a
hot dog so Kyle wins that one and
actually you beat no it's we tied we
tied the hundred they both got the same
we both went from one hundred and
eighteen hundred and nineteen at the
exact same time that's hilarious
I got a switch off of it's good to know
that you guys think that Paul and I are
equivalent in our fat ass hurry well
that's that's impressive
yeah alright I'm flattered but since
technically I lost I get to drink my
beer that you do so that's you do is
anyone is anyone bottom bothered by the
fact that we're halfway to my show and
haven't talked about a single lick of
tech news hopefully not I mean we let
sorry if you look to computers that was
that is true this doesn't do that was
some things tech related but this next
segment is certainly not no it's not
unless you consider the fact that it is
a flash game that was probably made on a
computer where do we need the other
keyboard uh how far does that thing is
is something a pain to get in the middle
here or I think so it's a one key game I
don't even like Nash one I can try I
hope I don't press anything oh yeah it's
like master control as well I'm sure
it'll be fine there's only like a couple
shortcut keys
like f1 through f12 and a through Z yeah
a through Z you know the control WASD
and the numpad that's all it's matched
to anything okay so we're gonna spray
tube jumpers we're gonna play tube
jumpers this is a triple-a title
yeah until you sing is turned off
obviously it's a good thing that I have
a 1080 Ti in the new streaming yessum
because this is gonna be crazy
turned off we've disabled msaa just
because we don't want any sort of
slowdowns while we're streaming here is
we're trying to be reasonable the losers
still died or whatever punishment is no
longer death can I have it we have since
switch that over of course you made
which means I need to finish mind you
thank you we've switched punishment to I
had tentatively little green man taking
a little green man on after drinking
object but I'm open to switching it up
maybe you know loser has to sing little
Madonna song only the loser has little
green man yeah of course that makes
sense only the loser has little green
man but you know what no how about we
both lose how about how about little
green man applies to both of us
regardless of who loses so the winner
the winner simply gets bragging rights
and gets to rub it in the other person's
face for all time well alright so
regardless oh look there's a walkthrough
video we're both screwed should we watch
it probably not okay
I actually have no idea how to play this
game so move we should have watched it
two players okay clear right to change
player color alright looks like what
color do you want to be I'll be I'll be
right uh wants to be red the dirt that's
kind of a magenta is that is that right
it's close enough ain't blue or green to
represent Intel or AMD or Intel Nvidia
I'm gonna be this kind of light blue
color here like
that's very peaceful and then the let's
play by the three clear blue sky or the
this contest hosted by in waters of the
in the Caribbean
all right clouds let's play no idea so
okay the idea is to keep your character
on his little eye his little boat okay I
is to jump is a physics game so as soon
as you your guy goes he's gonna he's
gonna like float in the wind and stuff
we'll do a practice round so you can get
a feel for how the physics works okay so
press I when you're ready and so these
things are these little tubes that we're
on they're gonna jump and you kind of
just got a oh alright so you'll notice
when you jump your character will fly
back and it looks like you got a stay
stay in the thing yeah you gonna stay in
the finish sharks oh my god I'm like oh
geez I oh geez and then you know it
looks like while you're airborne you can
sort of you can sort it it looks like
you can sort of WASD in air so I think I
got the ijkl here yeah yeah alright
alright alright that was a warm-up round
so we're going this is going for broke
here go I'm guessing there's no sound
oh wait and I muted it hold on you gotta
have the sound this is like 5.1 surround
right here HD audio yeah look at that
this was this was composed by Beethoven
okay alright so play again
alright ready I think so here we go I'm
in front now no really
oh yeah you are you're blue so I got the
blue shorts on what
that was stupid okay so game is late
you're already down yeah quick all right
will do vessel do five best of
best-of-seven four times four that's
four best four of seven four seven
okay so tails up it's a nice Friday I'm
in the bank now yeah this is totally
except for four yep
wait I'm white now yeah you're in the
front now no I was black before it's
like my guide literally just had like a
race change you can't see red game in
this type of
game it's not important no no no my guys
like dad he's like but both of our guys
are like lifeless on there oh my gosh
oh no no jerks there's obstacle dirt
came very close to getting me there stay
in them oh you good I was stupid I think
if you met if you hold down I your guy
will go forward did you know that I mean
hold down if you hold I in midair I mean
they're up yeah
oh well that's right I didn't know that
okay all right I was holding left
alright let's let's do it from scratch I
feel like I've had a bit more practice
in this game you see that's like you're
very very skilled with this game yeah
let's try we'll try again and told by
many people who have certain abilities
okay so try it again so if you want to
move forward in midair try just oh that
old way that's way more effective oh
wait you landed into mine and I just
landed in the water no you okay you
thought you were the other person oh
yeah oh wow I wasn't the no.1 do you
thought it was more sad okay good yeah
it'll make sense yeah it really helps to
know who you are
playing a game I'm in the back now
alright says their names
yes that's astute observation okay that
I clearly AM miss I mean sometimes okay
oh there's a big one big kahuna yeah oh
that's so we're better now now good
shape okay we have forward so do you
want it you want to consider this our
first round or second round just i quick
this is gonna be second round alright
second around so you you're down 1 then
again 1 101 okay you know taking one for
this no that was stupid okay so you
still won I barely died before you
alright you're up to - nothing
junetta at this point to narrative I'm
in the front this time first one okay
first one - for this when the four takes
all the marbles I feel like you want to
be lying down right oh my gosh like I
want to be as low as possible in my
little Tetris shaped boat how do you
we're just like the grab onto the boat
option that we get that one arrow come
on come on whoa oh yeah rim their beach
ball I don't like that beach ball I'm
worried about the beach it disappeared
it's a ghost beach ball it's a ghost
beasts no jumped in after you again Yugi
I like if I had held up for three more
seconds all right Cal's up three nothing
ma'am you me and worked here that's
right Gilda here we go
sweat this oh my god actually it's not
too bad in here it I don't know what
happened there I died I just dove in
after potentially completely intentional
trying to save me Hey so it's one three
one now yes making a little attempting
to come back I just got to get you one
more time you can call it a day big wave
Big Kahuna whoa whoa there's things in
the air well you get first pick it up
because I was yeah they took both of us
have one then the other
I didn't really suffer cause I was like
oh look little animations cast fun
animations for you know the environments
decor nope that's gonna kill you all
right Wow I mean it's it seems to make
sense in a game like that a game of
skill
I can't I can't keep over these Triple A
games now there's just too many controls
well I mean I think it's it really shows
where you get what you can do with like
tessellation though that's the same
point and that's a good point
you know rash rasterized the draw
distance was great with the ray tracing
yes it's pretty
all the pixels in the pipelines anyway
those sorry sorry yeah sorry sorry you
didn't put up more of it the fight there
no that's okay but it's okay
that's alright let's what's next next up
is uh is tech news so I think at this
point we're gonna both proceed to they
have a goner the little green man rule
okay which for those of you who aren't
aware little green man rule just means
it derives from like older drinking
games and stuff before you take a drink
you have an invisible green man that
sits up that lives on the rim of your
glass at all times so before you take a
drink you have to take the invisible
green man off of your cup or your glass
put him on the desk take your drink and
always remember to put the little green
man back on your glass cuz he can only
breathe he's like a fish out of water
when he's off of his glass he starts he
spoke hyperventilating and he'll die
don't die if they want to miss your
little green men and if you if you miss
one of those two actions then you have
to take another drink alright and if you
forget to take the little green man off
the next time this you another drink
then you have to it's like a perpetual
and I need do it again when getting it
out that's like eventually you just you
might as well just do a keg stand for
like ten minutes pretty much for a
little green man alright let's talk
about some tech news finally first off
Corsair has launched some SSDs
apparently on Newegg these were spotted
on the old egg the other day perhaps
today
Tom's Hardware has reported on this
these are the neutron this falls under
the existing neutron line of course
Harris drives which we're all pretty
familiar with by now however these are
this is the nx500 that you're looking at
right here as you can see it's an add in
carbon it's an atom carter this nvme
pcie of course and it's advertised at
3,000 megabytes per second sequential
performance I would imagine that's for
both reads and writes there abouts the
UNIX 500 uses a face on or it's by Sun
or bison I have always said flies on the
dime eyes I had I don't know if eyes on
I guess what I would have Xavier oughtta
PS five thousand seven
eise evan add-in card reference design
very similar to the zotac sonic switch
that says this pre-recorded it's
pre-recorded how did they figure it out
dang it wait I what you did there I see
it
all right dere an amount not listed on
new egg but these may be the
long-awaited retail version of the
double DDR prototypes that will be these
what Double Dee Dee's that Tom's
Hardware tested last March the product
page specifies mlc flash but there's no
mention of 3d NAND and you're gonna be
able to get these in either 400 or 800
gigabyte models the fact that they're
for the fact that they're at 400 and 800
and not like for example 512 gigabyte or
a thousand and twenty four gigabyte
indicates that there's a lot of
over-provisioning going on that's of
course a process used to increase the
random performance during extremely
heavy workloads and the drives should
feature full binary capacities 512 and
1024 with ample amounts in reserve
listing the listing on new eggs shows
identical performance to Corsairs MP 500
m2 nvme SSD which which also uses the
Bizon be 7 controller but it does have
superior random random performance
300,000 I ups versus 250,000 I ops and
this is of course thanks to the
over-provisioning and perhaps the big
heat sink that's on there to keep things
cool as the drive spins up art not spins
up as the drive heats up under heavy
workloads I'm about two drives can get
pretty toasty so that's why companies
like ek as we just mentioned earlier
I've been making dedicated heat sinks
for them and things like that this one
looks pretty pretty beefy for in SSDs so
hopefully it does the job well pricing
however was not mentioned or maybe it
was well is there a yeah table I showed
able to do the trick
okay here we go so 320 dollars for the
400 gigabyte model and $700
nx500 eight gigabyte version which is
steep very steep certain gme drives
though you know they're ready they're
like they're like one luxury man pc
items and I think three hundred three
thousand megabytes per second that's
pretty much on par with like a 960 pro
right
I believe the 960 pros around 3000
megabytes or maybe I've actually it's
probably 3,500 the singles there's still
a bit faster I don't know the numbers
off the top of my head yeah it's a bit
faster its but but hey you know I MP 500
is available in 120 gig to 40 gig and
480 gig and that's just a stick right
that's little MDOT to stick yeah so yeah
like you said over-provisioning or
whatever else is going on here as far as
how they configured the NAND and the
controller on this drive it definitely
seems like they're trying to make it
seem a little bit more hopefully your
formants oriented they offer just a
animistic as well for maybe a little bit
less they don't have to implement like
the heatsink on it and stuff well I mean
if it's if it's the same controller as
the MP 500 then the MP 500 is is the m
dot 2 version there so that's what I
would assume um no no the format's on
why I can't again it said that there's
it's got slightly better random
performance than of MP 500 so it could
just you know it has the same controller
but just different confused over
provisioning properties at the very
least now you know it exists and you can
go buy 10 of them if you so choose and
the numbers by the way as far as
comparison to the MP 500 is probably
just what the controller max is at I
would three thousand megabytes per
second twenty four hundred reads 2400
megabytes per second writes hmm I ups
are like like you said I apps are higher
yeah three hundred thousand voters just
250 anyway well cool yeah good job
of course here next up we were talking
about msi releasing a custom bios that
is optimized
for cryptocurrency mining what has the
world come to ladies and gentlemen
gaming motherboard this heart goes out
to all of the gamers out there this
article by the way is from PC gamer the
last one was from Tom's Hardware but the
crypto mining optimised BIOS updates
have started to roll out from our
friends at MSI for several high-end
motherboards that I forgotten the little
green man oh you did did I forget mine I
haven't been paying attention to you at
all
but I just called myself up okay little
green man yes gave me dream man that
 I am gonna pour beer I know to take
a little green man I did there I just
sorry I of course I did you literally
just reminded me someone that said
someone said to drinks now it's to
drinks you know killed him twice
someone's with Kyle drank the green man
so maybe so you we both did it we both
did it
yeah okay fine okay for the record
though the green man doesn't apply when
you're pouring beers you can hang on you
can hang on tight all right but I'm
gonna do a double drink now no green man
comes off it's good that's the right
thing to do
know where he's got a parachute he's
almost there if he's good that would
make sense the my couldn't use the
parachute if you fell off but he picked
it up normal because he wasn't expecting
it you take him by surprise if you just
throw him off the glass
anyway rules fees Eamonn BIOS updates
for Bitcoin what mine but what does the
biosuit do does it ie does it
reconfigure how no PCI Express Lanes are
routed to the different PCIe slot so you
can connect them more additional PCI
devices you can have more graphics cards
so right now what I said yeah you said
it we took way too long though
now you just been like more his mother
out of it starts I just stated it more
perspicuous Lea than you did that purse
picky when ever the hell you just said
irrelevant to the story six you can have
like like five or six graphics cards now
whereas before on certain z170 Z 270 and
later boards there there would be like
when you would go to Device Manager your
six connected graphics cards maybe four
to five of them maybe yeah four to five
of them would actually have like an
exclamation mark next to it saying this
isn't gonna function properly for your
for your mining tendencies but hopefully
MSI is trying to release this or they
just updated their BIOS with with
properties that kind of fix that
especially for their high-end
motherboards and it's kind of
interesting if you're if you're a
cryptocurrency miner you may have some
issues getting a an affordable
motherboard that can handle the mining
because intel has discontinued their H
81 and what was the and there'd be 85
chipset boards so these cheaper
motherboards for mining are a little bit
harder to come by so a lot of miners
have actually been buying up 100 series
chipset boards like C 170 for example
some some of them buying into ZZ 270 as
well so MSI is still rolling out these
new bio C's for these older slightly
older chipsets because a lot of miners
returning to them
for use and again it's it's really just
so that people can configure like you
said Paul multiple graphics cards like
more than an average amount for for the
for the typical gamer some is just one
or two car that assumption is like you
know you got a PCIe layout where you
have a by sixteen at the top or it can
go by eight or by eight or you have
other lanes coming off the chipset or
whatever maybe just wanna be up in like
you know this lowest slot here will be
set to by four or by eight but if you
plug a card in there than like three or
four of these by one slots won't work
but you don't need a full PCIe
connection for graphics card if your
cryptocurrency mining so it probably
reconfigures it so that if you actually
do slot something into the slowest slot
it sets it up for by one or by two and
still be able even see more lanes active
for the other PCIe slot entually be
that's what I'm guessing that sounds I
don't know pretty sound but that's what
I assume I believe it that's kind of
interesting if they're able to do that
with the BIOS update that's yeah I would
have expected I've always kind of
assumed that was more of a like you know
there's fixed switches in there that
just configure themselves one way or
another based on what's connected but
right thank you put that mother yeah no
but it's very least this is exciting for
minors and potentially scary for gamers
who are trying to build systems because
we're already experiencing an insane
shortage and inflation of graphics cards
because of this crypto mining craze and
it seems like there is a possibility
that motherboards are gonna be getting
bought out more frequently for for the
same reasons and how bad would that be
if like the two main components that you
need to build a computer a gaming system
anyway or a motherboard in a graphics
card or now like I either hard to find
or impossible to find or just have
skyrocketed in price across the board
that's gonna be really graphic graphics
cards cuz graphics cards are sold out
much what's alright
a little agreement graphics cards are
selling out because proportionally
there's a lot more graphics cards being
sold per system I wouldn't see
motherboards being sold out but I
wouldn't see this being something where
the motherboard manufacturers are
looking at the boards that are most
popular for mining which are gonna be
the boards that are the cheapest that
get the job done because that's all
miners care about how can I spend the
least possible amount of money to start
mining and start making some money right
they're trying to take other boards that
maybe they're still stock of whereas the
cheapest ones are sold out but people
are still looking for whatever they can
get their hands on and make those more
viable for miners but I wouldn't expect
them to sell out like like graphics
cards would I hope not I hope you're
right yeah I hope not too and I and I'm
leaning more towards your side of the
argument - do we have a subscribe button
on Twitch - I don't think we have
anything on Twitch
well no cuz they gave everyone subscribe
buttons your Sam does right now they sip
those awesome hardware guys don't give
them one they get no subscribe button
because we're where's our subscribe
button do you not see it because you're
already on you're not even logged in see
I've no subscribe but like yeah gives
you enlarge the wins if you enlarge the
windows there's no sub button and an art
like maximize the window for a split
second because sometimes it doesn't
stuff doesn't show up if it's not wide
enough isn't a follow
there's follow but not subscribe yeah
well there's you got there's a twitch
partner and there's twitch affiliate and
yeah we're neither so alright okay
cell-cell knows all these things he's
like yeah you guys don't know Mary's dog
is growling at some dog OHS oh hey so um
thanks Emma sigh for promoting crypto
currency mining and screwing over the
rest of us turn to private no hopefully
hopefully nothing bad comes of this and
motherboards will be just as accessible
and affordable as they always have been
but we shall wait and see
next up kind of an interesting story
here that could potentially be did I
kill the green man again I'm sorry if I
did I don't know but I hope Chad it's
keeping you honest cuz I'm not watching
you at all
you're not doing a very good job at that
no I think so um this is from ARS
technica they wrote up an article about
Donald Duck
no Donald truck actually why are you
loading an article that has Trump in the
hip sorry Donald Trump the second most
famous Donald which which is about
Twitter of course what else would Donald
Trump be involved in than Twitter now
I'm gonna try to keep this very limited
on the political aspect of things and
more so on the tech side share you are
yeah yeah this is all part of my secret
agenda communist propaganda so
Trump was sued recently by a handful of
twitter twitter twitter users that's a
new social media site twitter users
backed by the night first amendment
Institute at Columbia University these
these people these Twitter users sued
the president I didn't know you could do
that I thought if you tried to see the
president be like you can't you can't do
that so he's he's the president he can't
get sued it's just not we wrote that
into the rules but they sued him
claiming that blocking them from his
Twitter account violated their
constitutional rights what do you know
the suit claims that it's rubbish the
Constitution talks about Twitter it does
it's right there and plays you our
founding fathers knew what was up all
right they chiseled it in with stone
granite the same things the suit claims
that Trump's Twitter feed is a public
forum so this is their argument this is
what they have people suing Trump said
they're like look you've got this new
year the president United States your
Twitter account is a little bit
different than anyone elses Twitter
account it's basically a public forum
where we're getting live updates from
you and it's it's sort of like an open
forum where we can just kind of come to
you with our with our open expressions
and our thoughts here oh just licked my
leg and it was very warm and very
interesting oh yeah um he does that so
they're treating like a public forum and
and they're saying that his Twitter
account is entombing oh my gosh he's
completely and wrapped himself
in rap themselves heroes in rap his
gender I literally had to pull the power
cable around his body oh good job there
he has no again he has no clue what's
going saved it yep anyway so they're
saying that Trump's Twitter feed is a
public forum and an official voice of
the President and so because of that
excluding people from reading or
replying to his tweets is
unconstitutional and it reaches the
First Amendment according to the lawsuit
they're also claiming that this is more
or less akin to a mayor ejecting critic
critics from city hall meetings they're
saying that you Trump banning us from
Twitter or blocking us from his Twitter
account is the same as a mayor ejecting
critics from city hall meetings we have
a right to be here we have a right to go
on your Twitter account and read all the
 that you said and complain about
all the we don't like and critique
and criticize and all this stuff
the suit is also asking that a federal
judge declare it unconstitutional to
block people from here on out on Trump's
Twitter feed the suit also demands that
Trump be barred from blocking people on
his Twitter feed in general let's just
like revoke his ability to block people
on his Twitter feed so this makes for an
interesting discussion Paul what what do
you think about this just right after
that first initial repressions do you
think that Trump has a right to block
people on his own personal Twitter
account or is the fact that he is now
the president his Twitter account now
transcends personal use it's now the
open forum for the people where they
have a right to express themselves and
get their message heard by the President
or do you think no it's this
Twitter account it's just a splitter
account guys is it just a Twitter
account that's what it comes down to is
it just a Twitter account or is it a
public forum based on Donald Trump's
position and status I think reddit
earlier today if I had to make a
decision I would say he could block
whoever he wants on his personal Twitter
account there's also a POTUS account
which is for the
president separate then maybe there'd be
more of a cause to say like that account
shouldn't block people because that's a
public record and everything but I think
his his personal one is being also
public record as well I don't know it's
hard to say because I think an argument
against it would be like well he's
blocking you personally when you're
logged in but anyone who's not logged in
can go look at any tweets that he says
true like so it's not like you're barred
from seeing anything or whatever so
right I'd say for the most part yeah
it's furious and yeah I would
have to agree it's like come on I mean
and then also kind of curious you forgot
the Green Man again thanks Jeff yeah I
love how you lose face off and I get
punished the most for was completely
huge as I was totally my call to kiss
the loser yeah just losing or we could
both do it I know because I did it for I
did it for the I did it for the fans and
I thought it'd be more entertaining and
sure enough hopefully it yep sorry sorry
um yeah I agree I think Donald Trump
whatever you wanna say about him it's
it's a friggin Twitter account and I'd
be really curious to see what were the
tweets that were sent by those people
before they got banned I'd be curious
like were they were they really like
critic criticisms or was it like you
piece of moron doe smack I don't
know actually that sounds kind of like a
I don't have to dig my hole any deeper
than it needs to Beit ladies and
gentlemen
so it's it's interesting though that as
since Donald Trump I would I think it's
fair to say that Donald Trump is by far
and away the most active president we've
ever had on Twitter oh yeah right
and that that's kind of cool it away
just because it's sort of reshaping how
we look at social media from a political
point of view and and there's probably a
lot of a lot more a lot like like
Twitter will be in the courtroom like
the topic of Twitter will be a courtroom
issue like more than it ever has been
before simply because Donald Trump's on
24/7 he just can't seem to stop tweeting
but
seems more likely just to the past 24
hours would be his sons tweets in the
courtroom but let's let's move on that's
all right I don't know much about that
so yeah it's pretty imagination now
let's move on I don't like don't to get
you started I make it completely
different new show to talk about all
that hey one day we'll do a political
rant Netflix all street anglex Netflix
is not Netflix but a Netflix esque or
Netflix like streaming service for
gaming Oh will launch this summer does
here summer is it using video grid
technology no it doesn't I'm not sure
what they use its WCF tech articles so
this could all be a lie anyway I
wouldn't be surprised if grid is the
backbone maybe it doesn't I feel like if
it was though they would mention it
unless they don't know about it yet
it's WCF tech so we don't it could all
be fake fake news I want to come up with
a new phrase like I feel like because I
watched a little bit of the the wine
show this is this past week yeah and
they've brought up a WCC F Tech article
and they were like it's WCC F Tech some
grain of salt or whatever and I'm like I
want to cope with a new phrase something
else that we say yes w z CF tech you
know gouge your eyes out I don't know it
like I feel like this could have better
ideas we'll come up with something green
of salt well let's see um you know just
the tip it's WCC F Tech so so just the
tip the virgin sacrifice was successful
like Evan I don't know
well there's better tip your process
there's better ones hits it everyone tip
your prospect all right so we're
watching in the summer next summer in
this summer this summer apparently it's
already summer we're in the middle of
summer it's gonna watch the end of
summer
it's a stupid time no no that's not
lunch anything at the end of summer for
a gaming surface and all the fun stuff
ends actually summer I'd be a good Oh
beginning of set are you gonna watch at
the end December it's gonna suck then
cuz everything that's awesome happens
during summer or you know if I was
thinking strategically about launching a
game sir
I think the beginning of summer right
when I could get a bunch of people who
were you know school alpha school
whatever work on it but exactly other
otherwise its its launch it without that
my tents and then you know you you you
that's the ground you lay the groundwork
then you do your testing you get
everything smoothed out and then you
have your big wider and more public
launch right at the beginning of like
the back-to-school season and then it
leads into the the holidays that's yes
that's how marketing works so that's
hurt those are very good points bottom
and they are actually underway with the
tiger kids
sorry a beta there's a beta going on
till July 24th when they have about 10
to 20 sample titles that you can play
around with but the platform is called
jump or that's who's organizing this
whole thing this company called jump
will focus on older titles actually more
so than newer ones so this is kind of
gonna be led in indie game Haven more or
less so if you're into indie games then
this might be something that you're
interested in the platform is gonna be
hitting Windows Mac and Linux and
they're gonna have about 60 games 60 to
100 games at launch again the closed
beta is going on until July 24th with 10
to 20 games currently playable the full
version is going to release at the end
of this summer for ten bucks a month
which i think is a very fair price so
especially if they're just indie games
maybe my understanding of this was
different than at first so this isn't
like a distributed gaming platform where
they have a central server that's
running the game and then sends you that
you know lets you play it you're playing
the game locally this is this is a
service so this is similar to Steam but
you will rent it the games you only have
them temporarily or this is a streaming
streaming so you will be able to fully
stream these games without ever having
them ok so the games are the games are
running on a remote server alright ok ok
are running on a remote server there's
no note of that but if it's streaming
then that's again yeah that's the only
thing goes to make it Netflix like
correct and it says in the title it's a
streaming service which I think might
make like it might be a bit premature to
offer a full-fledged a streaming game
service right now just because of the
latency and I don't think we've quite
figured out that one
what little green man oh my god
I then I forget mine too I probably did
oh no I probably did I'm so sorry I
should name my green man because I have
to talk to him so freakin Morrison I'm
so sorry Orson Orson Welles does I mean
if you think about it Paul streaming
service right now with the like the lag
latency that's involved like no triple-a
title very few like I don't know a lot
of triple-a titles are gonna be
unplayable because you need that extra
fast response time you know they're more
competitive based but an indie game
doesn't necessarily rely solely on just
super quick fast-paced action like a lot
of these Michael Bay as video games do
these days so I feel like no you're
wrong like an indie game is more so
about like this story it's about the
environments but the art what the
characters fast-paced shooter indie game
knows that is totally true that is
totally true and those just you know our
inferior in every way no one place them
but if you you know I feel like indie
game might be a good this might be a
good proof of performance of a streaming
service it's like hey we did indie games
versus the baby steps let's not try to
go you know battlefield 5 right now
weight or battlefield 2 whatever they
decide to call the next clip I don't
know maybe blopps no Maps um but anyway
indie games I feel like would be it cool
I could play some indie games with like
a tiny bit of latency yeah I take that
back
like what about like hotline Miami
though you can't have any latency for
that game that's an exception that's
true so there will always be exceptions
though probably be some games that are
more viable for the platform than others
yeah RPGs RTS a--'s city builders
exactly dumb sloths you're pretty smart
for being dumb slaw I didn't but I do
believe that steam just because it's a
large and valve being as large as it is
can be a more difficult platform if
you're a smaller company you're like an
indie dev or something like that so if
this did gain some momentum or it became
a platform yeah
where you know maybe it could surface
some good indie game work on something
that's not steamed and that I could see
that being yeah I it's definitely
exciting if you are an indeed indie
developer because it's just an
additional revenue stream that maybe you
didn't get the popularity or success
that you wanted to on steam because it's
such a big pond this would be a smaller
pond you'd be a bigger fish inside of it
in order to get some eyeballs and
visibility on your game which is cool
it's pretty cool so let's move on to the
next it's not a final story here really
quick really quick just some bullet
points NDG I've good Jeffers
even Jay the good tivity ty put wood
three hybrid okay honestly like but if
you had no idea what about acronyms and
you just that you have the F good
Jeffers get X 1080 I guessed I would be
the empty the T tie tight little Ramey
pass a lot T that's he finds he 423 two
hybrid line hybrid okay so that's a
1080i with a little cooler on it yeah
it's it's got a built in 120 millimeter
radiator IO and it's featuring icx
technology so this is an actual hydro
card that has icx with the all like nine
thermal sensors on it the MC nm sensors
right now m-net is MCN multi-channel
networks yeah no that's not I'm C is the
acronym for the actual temperature a
little controller droid
I thought nxs forget it's not MCM that's
multi you're right it has a little
acronym I don't I don't remember what it
is that it whatever you guys know we
both did videos on this I feel annoyed
that I don't know
at top of my head it's okay we've been
drinking so this is a bass bass boost
clock of fifteen hundred and sixty nine
and sixteen hundred and eighty-three
megahertz respectively this is actually
tying for EVGA 'he's fastest out of the
box frequencies along with the
waterblock model and two other for the
win three air-cooled designs so pretty
much not the kingpin um is a kingpin
even available yet
I don't know it's a good question
but we've also got some additional an
additional cooling plate that makes
direct contact with the copper block the
vrm area has a dedicated heatsink and
fan and it is rocking a full backplate
as you can see right there with plenty
of ventilation it's probably making some
direct contact with some of the the
memory module or not the memory modules
but them some of the elements on the PCB
there it's got like the Star Wars space
station design here for the and the air
gaps the new card is listed at 850 us
$850 that's a lot of money now am i low
what a founders edition Ti is 700 I
believe so so that's that's $150 premium
for a water-cooled agreement card which
some may argue is totally worth it
others not at all so it's gonna just
depend on you and your needs as user but
that's pretty much all we got protect
news people so let's go ahead and roll
into some of our donations here you guys
have been donating all show log we are
gonna read all the messages you attached
to them starting with Fred rant we
already talked to respondent to his
you're right did you remember the price
nobody denies we're doing what we can't
Fred but probably not scott until big
six dollars and six cents daddy favorite
childhood computer game thanks guys as
always now that computer game oh man I'm
gonna throw this out there jump man jr.
on commodore 64 jumper jump jump man
jump man jump man junior
that's original is the game I can
remember playing the most at the
earliest age I guess is how it would
phrase that mine was Commodore 64 mine
was the Magic School Bus educational
game Magic School Bus
I think a while I played it a lot I
think game called story machines very
sad as that might have also been a
Commodore 64 game I'm not sure but yeah
we're going way back from way back
thanks God before I was born
Luke Luke F not prefer for Paul just say
he reads Cosmo no I just said it would
made me I was I said it would make me
feel cosmopolitan which means like you
know urban and and refine that creates
in volt cultured and now that creates an
equal amount of confusion why not
clarify anything cultured cultured I'm
and not exactly culture but I mean this
yeah not Luke refer for favor but thank
you thank you Luke thanks Luke I don't
read Cosmo only when I'm checking out at
the grocery store I'm in his bathroom
before it was cosmos every pepper just
cosmos on the wall stuck to the ceiling
don't ask me why
automatic tech $10 hey guys heading into
the night shift with no Wi-Fi so please
split this sorry for the inconvenience
no one convenience uh added whatsoever
I'm out ten at all
thanks very much for the ten bucks
appreciate that I had a night shift with
no Wi-Fi though that sucks
it does hope you need one degree view
you need YouTube read and download like
a bunch of videos yeah offline last
that's a good option align it thank you
very much though okay
five dollars El Jefe here to show some
love and supports drinking some drinks
brewery jefe Hefeweizen today cheers
fellows chillin you Jeff it really takes
El Jefe seriously so gay man I agree man
I feel like I forgot it once before - so
as long as you take them off before you
drink it that's okay yeah okay or you
drink baby ciao ciao
TV chat with a $5 I have enough money to
purchase the Corsair the 570 X's along
with the ek water brach a 240 G prime
day dear
pres prang de ser won't not need yay or
nay wealthy V I think if you really want
it and you don't need it then it boils
down to budget can you afford it yeah I
set you back are there other things that
in your life that you need to prioritize
monetarily wise or do you have a bit
more disposable income right now and
things are looking good and you know
what you can afford some things that you
just want and don't need you got your
bills I'll handle treat yo'self
son life is short you pick up the things
you want as long as you're taking care
of all your other business I don't give
a
I would agree just what I would say is
the new case and a fancy water cooler or
even a a semi custom water cooling kit
isn't going to give you a ton of extra
performance so unless you're already
rocking a pretty high-end system I might
consider investing that elsewhere there
have been some really nice CPU deals
today there was a seven and r7 1700 was
on sale for like two hundred and sixty
or two hundred and seventy bucks ooh
for an eight core eight core 16 thread
the even insulate a couple I know the
the 7600 K was like down to eight 170 or
180 me he's like 185 something like that
I think the 7700 K was on sale as well
but I don't recall what the price was
but you know what I will say that the
ek8 240g
isn't it is a nice way to get your foot
in the door with custom water cooling
yeah it's a superuser I'm looking at
that then then for sure
yeah because comes with all you need
because otherwise you have to buy out
all the parts yourself which is just as
confusing as if it's your first time
ever building a PC like you don't know
where to look like which parts add up
like how do you pair your fittings
you're tubing with your water blocks to
make sure everything fits it's a really
nice easy way to just get introduced to
custom water cooling it comes with a
manual like a user's manual it's super
clear all the pictures in the text are
extremely incredibly helpful so it I
will say that if you're just trying to
if you want to just like sort of scratch
that itch of custom water cooling it
definitely provides that and the course
here 570 X is an excellent case hey well
what do you know exhibit a exhibit a 242
phone it may be so this is the
difference in 8 to 40 and 8 to 40 G so
the to 40 G comes with the GPU block
that's what graphics card but everything
else is pretty much the same 360 G over
there then this is 360 G yeah and even
realize there's a 360 G what know that
yeah no that's 240 Jesus I was gonna say
that was not an e KS gang one I was like
I don't remember there being a 360 G
you've got some exclusive oh yeah
this one's really nice this is a really
nice little kit here one thing to be
aware of though is that this is a fully
aluminum system so if you ever wanted to
upgrade like your radiator or add on the
radiator or any kind of like fittings or
anything oh another block in the future
you would have to make sure that it is
aluminum otherwise you're gonna run into
galvanic corrosion by fornicating
different metals in the same loop that's
what causes it or it occasionally
fornication I said it didn't hear the
sentence to the fires of hellfire and
damnation come down a party water cool
and loop because rusts and other various
particles to collect and there might be
of like some some like old old here
like the Wild West out like a kiosk like
get your elixirs your popular elixirs a
little tear cancer and save your baby's
life might be of like just some guy like
rheumatoid arthritis yeah yeah any
leftover freak down to the pig slap
it'll make them all come one come on put
my wiener in your bug you the fattest
holiday ham you've ever had this time of
year God ma'am you got some holy nails
out there I witness as I've never done
this act
before it all but somehow it just seems
dealer than that just killing it
naturally okay we're done donation oh my
god yes okay hopefully the whole hub
stop take a child thank you very much
automatic Matt five dollars sorry I was
signed into automatic tech by accident
split this - oh thanks automatic madness
Matt now we know that you are also
automatic tech your cigarette has been
revealed useful information Hayden
passcode five five oh forgot the Green
Man Oh a done hey guys love the show but
would you recommend a good free sync IPS
display for around six hundred and fifty
dollars doing keep doing what you're
doing
ah I just watched the video that level
one texted Wendell at level one text did
it's a Korean one but it's about 650
bucks 34 40 by 1440 ultra-wide he got
some pretty nice performance out of it
it's overclockable and I think on his he
hit 95 Hertz
oh that's beautiful for freesync so
that's an excellent option and use that
oh yeah yeah that size and resolution
everything I don't recall the actual
name of it but go to level one text l1
text on YouTube and it's one of the last
couple videos he did that's about half
price of like any g-sync equivalent with
all this oh yeah a comparison do you
think it's ridiculous
Vincent foo five dollars trying to talk
to a friend trying to talk a friend talk
trying to talk trying to talk a friend
to custom-build instead of prebuilt okay
try try to talk him into doing that okay
so one opinion on what our key benefits
of a custom build I love the videos from
both you guys um let's see a custom
build instead of a pre-built so for one
I think you can you can spend like that
your money goes further right with the
pre build yeah I'm not exactly tailoring
the system to your needs but with doing
it yourself you can tailor it perfectly
to every need that you you have so that
it's completely custom fitted to your
liking and for what you're gonna be
using it for and it also gives you sort
of this intimate knowledge of your PC so
that if you ever need to go in and
service it in any way or if you ever
feel like upgrading it in any way then
you feel more comfortable and confident
to do
with with your newfound knowledge of
building it yourself it's it's enjoyable
it's rewarding to actually boot your
system up that you personally built for
the first time in watching it light up
like a Christmas tree
it's a magical feeling you won't get
elsewhere and overall it's all you can
add on to that yeah everything Kyle said
plus just just know like if you spend a
little bit more money on a system that's
built by a company that's gets sent to
you like that's an okay way to go just
know if anything ever goes wrong with
that system you're gonna be waiting on
that company to service it whether you
bring it in or however their service
happens to work if you build it yourself
you'll probably know how to fix it
yourself so that's what I feel like it's
good also so thank you for being on
point tonight and you've window in very
quickly
Wendell oh so if you if you know there's
a window emoji I guess if you follow
Wendell on yeah see you there on top of
that kinda Maccabi pace didn't see him
career that's pretty awesome all right
thank you very much Vincent the giant
ninja $10 Cheers cheers to you sir
thanks Jen enjoy we go yes ninja thank
you ninja taxer x95 $10 I've got this so
many more donations okay split these
tips or do I need to donate again on
Paul stack you will need to donate begin
on a pulse ox yeah right now that all
goes scale it's all for me I get nothing
to keep rolling it in good zero donate
I'm here self as well buffalo warrior 7
$5 55 cents I caught three shows in a
row drinking Sierra Nevadas Summerfest
and it's delicious I've had that beard
like Sierra Nevada the shoots pine drops
IPAs up next dude let me know how that
is who gets the worst hangovers I do man
I get the worst hangover you do I get
the years all right you do cuz you're
you do cuz you drink more I do cuz I'm
older the older you get the more the
more pain-in-the-ass hangover so I guess
that's true yeah I'll have to give it to
cap J yes Goss with ten dollars a
Australian I think maybe I just wanted
to say thanks you guys changed me from
bored IT sales guy to actual enthusiast
for the first time in years also seventy
seven seventy seven hundred K plus ten
atti and a node 202
how good of a idea from one to
thermal meltdown not terrible I mean
your cpu solutions okay or 1080i as long
as you haven't set up get a blower style
version like founders edition to
probably work out good it's got it's
kind of an own dedicated air pit air
path in that case so yep I think you
would be just fine
the 7700 K though I will say unless
you're trying to fit some custom like an
AI o in there like I did with mine which
the no 202 does not natively support so
you will have to do some market
modifications perhaps yeah to get a case
Q in there it doesn't make too much
sense since the cooler that you'd be
able to fit in there which is gonna be a
super low profile one is not gonna be
able to allow you to overclock much at
all like you'll be way hot enough at the
stock turbo so what I would say is if
you are gonna go that route save some
money get an on case Q and it'll still
be blazing fast a standard 7700 and then
you want to get as much about thermals
ya see a little bit of money that way
indeed good advice and wings in line I
apologize if this has been said before
but your bit rate needs to be increased
for twitch if you're going to do that
I'd recommend 3,500 bitrate for a 720 by
6 little excerpt well fix that soon when
I get my very oh yeah I don't know a
double check that were probably probably
do the same thing rate the same great
waiver at a 1080 30 so probably 35
fighters doesn't really do that they can
wise thank you
huge huge tip Tamerlan Susie s 20 bucks
can you guys make a video on EGP you
performance comparing I am using the
latest MacBook Pro and love it for my
programming job but when I am at home I
want to use a GPU to play some games
under boot camp windows once in a while
a GPU like like an external GPU that you
would connect via Thunderbolt or
something like that right I have not
received any samples of anything like
that right
I can't say that I like I don't have a
MacBook at all so I can't say that I
would be delving into something like a
boot camp situation but an AGP for a
laptop is definitely something that's
viable and a lot more of the murk
coming out so I could see myself taking
a look at that sometime in the future
yeah of course it would need to be a
laptop that supported thunderbolt mm-hmm
so need to be an Intel at that but um
yeah possibly probably not exactly
premiere perspective with the MacBook
because that's just not something that I
and I I don't I don't we don't swing
that I work with Apple that much we
don't swing that way it's not because I
hate it it's because I have a limited
amount of information I can store my
brain and that's mainly because we know
all right
well Fred Fred rant $5 send used send
message on Kyle's YouTube with next
week's challenge let the fans vote oh
geez
okay he's gonna send a message to my
YouTube that's what I assume and makes
sense
mmm no we're down we're down for the pie
in the face thing
we're totally down we just yeah we
honestly you want to completely forgot
so great next week though we'll figure
that out Luke F again $5 just FYI
OpenSSL was patched in April to be
quantum proof making a solution for
Shores law much less desirable what does
that mean to you quantum proof is for
quantum computing open SSL Secure
Sockets Layer so it's why is he telling
us this I don't know I I don't know well
you do we say something earlier on in
the show that it related to this or just
so you know we were talking about maybe
something we're talking about prime
numbers because prime numbers are used
for foresee I don't know
no maybe sorry Luke you went over our
heads I love you not Luke looking for it
and I'm curious what Shores law is
though yeah because I'm not familiar
with that all right McNiel 421 $5 hey
Kyle I've been loving your vlogs and
comedic skits keep up the fine work
thank you sir
maybe Paul can follow suit now vlogs
skits come on I don't mind I don't mind
blogs I don't know I don't know I don't
know you like you your vlogs are fun I
like I watch your vlog I'm glad if you
like my vlogs I'm not saying do a long
time but so my thing is like a funny
purse I hate you have a
good sense of humor you should do more
skits it I hate I hate anything that
feels like I'm trying to be funny
anytime I feel like I'm making effort
towards being funny
I feel like fails miserably so you sound
like Stephen Colbert and like and all
those guys like like no it's just like I
don't know it just it's it's something
that just needs to sort of ooze out
naturally on its own
yeah I guess sorry so I don't know I
feel like any time I'm like I'm gonna
make this and it's gonna be funny means
it's not gonna be funny so if you like
the fact that you're trying negates like
E it's not a yeah it's a language so
your sense of humor has to come out
organically you feel more comfortable
like or you feel like it's best when it
comes out naturally instead of yeah or
like the times I feel like I've actually
been the most funny I had I wasn't even
trying to be funny right and it just
happens opposite like that
I had a I had a meal with my friend in
Chicago and his mother-in-law was just
dying of laughter the whole time
everything I said and I was like the
whole time I just like had a couple
drinks and I was just in a good mood now
I was just talking or whatever right and
I was like like I feel bad anytime I'm
gonna see her again cuz she's gonna
expect this level of Heuer from me I'm
like no I was just kind of on his own
for a minute and it was it was okay but
but that does get annoying go like out
like like a week after I posted us skips
comedy or whatever people just like go
as our viewer graphics card like yeah
aren't you funny guys you're funny or
nasty like jokes yeah funny me more yeah
it's great it's challenging but it's
solid you're comfortable and if you feel
you're in a good mood
and you do incorporate like humor into
your videos like all the time we're
gonna be like you'll just and the thing
is like it's so deadpan like most people
don't even just flies under it like
under the radar probably no one's even
gonna but realize that that's likely to
be like catches it is just they know
it's pure gold all right so uh thank you
very much mark drew
so we got one supersaurus supersaurus $5
hey guys my Corsair 750d makes my
hardware look tiny that's what she said
I'm looking at the air 540 or the
mastercase pro 5 opinions I'm a water
cool down the road
those are both pretty decent for water
cooling yeah they're also both kind of
different styles if face like the air
fact forties noir boxy yeah that's the
case profiles more than your standard
ever built in the mastercase pro 5
before believe it or not air 540 I know
for sure is a great case tons of air
flow yeah but if your water cooling tons
of radiator support as well mastercase
pro 5 has Rainier support at the top in
the front yeah I mean if there's if
there's a drawback to the master case
series it's that some of the add-ons and
accessories and stuff that you might
need to get in order to support more
stuff like you know they have an add-on
like bracket you can get for the for the
pump and everything oh yeah I forgot
that too yeah um so ya know yeah I agree
I I don't I'm not a huge fan of the
add-on mile add-on model that cooler
master is gone with I like the master
case series I don't have any problem
with that huge brand change that they
underwent years ago but I think the
add-on thing is not gamer centric
thinking oh they're 540 is a lot cheaper
it seems like DLC for your case eighty
bucks is the air 540 is uh no that's
full ATX I'm sorry he lives little green
man lives all right yeah Tommy a thumbs
up right now I don't know I would go the
air 540 personally just based on looks
it looks sexy I like that cube look okay
I think it looks badass
it's that big-ass window and you have
any add-ons I do the add-ons for the
master case series I like the 5 tea
actually
5t yeah that's the red and black one
wait is that the maker 5t this is an ATX
mid tower yeah
it's the one that comes with the handle
on top oh yeah that one's nice and it's
got it's got a lot of the accessories
you don't charge you extra for pimping
Wesson and I'll do they
I'm stock yeah and I think it comes with
yeah I believe it comes with tempered
glass I will say the air 540 can be sort
of difficult to find a place for cuz it
is so cubish in shape it has a wider
base on much wider base in most cases
this is a 5t this is my this is my faith
this is funny because I've never built
in this one but this is my favorite
iteration of the master case just
because I feel like that I think of the
red accents they did work well yeah
actually like the handle on top the
tempered glass gives you really nice
look at what's inside so for a
comparable price I might consider
something like this it is a more
standard layout as well but you don't
get tempered glass with the air 540 true
and I do feel like temper glasses is it
it's it's very nice yeah it's nice
hopefully that helps out though
supersaurus next have you got SuperPi
games for the 50 and okay which I don't
know what that is that's okay though
made a wood case it's on Kyle's Twitter
I want to take a look at it and we have
a link right here wait no that's not a
link the string of sorry we can't look
at it right now because we're short of
time but I will take a look at it later
I'm sure it's awesome I like what cases
we saw what cases at CES from I'm sorry
text me in when and when yep it had some
Greek would keep bamboo Megan seemed
VTech $5.00 they should partner with
Ubisoft and maybe they could have
servers Oh
jump I believe he's talking about the
jump Oh jumps yeah Netflix like gaming
service if they partner with Ubisoft
they could have service or if there's a
number of partners that they could
partner with essentially that could work
for them but
you know again well it's have to wait
and see how it's how its executed after
all said and done manual chair $5 do you
guys know if I can use the add-on 980ti
hybrid cooler on the 1080 TI fe then I
think you can if you're talking about
the EVGA one but I'm not positive go on
Twitter and message EVGA Jakob Beth and
maybe you can tell you for sure yeah or
yeah I just that's one of those things
I'm not sure about uh stop in my head I
bet there's resources online that could
confirm that for you as well but i think
i think the one the EVGA uses is a
foundries edition Fred ran to another
five bucks when well then for the
following week you will need to post it
as a pull it was too long to put into
check okay so um I guess yeah that's
fine
you just give us my ma height of the
face the face sounds good to me Supreme
X supreme 84 X five dollars with
overclocking involved what's the best
1366 990 xw 3 6 9 0 X 56 90 X 56 75 I
has NHD 15 that's not to a cooler no
saving up for new system but upgrading
my current 930 love you guys
I think the 990 X was the top of the
range on LGA 1366 all the other ones are
processed honestly i processors yeah
those are all LGA 1366 processors
depending on the chipset that you had
cuz there's X 58 and there's also I
believe a crossover chipset that was
more of a server bound one that might
have affected the CPU compatibility and
HD 15 you should be fine with though but
yeah man that's that's old school
that's that's old enough that I would
need to free reference some what's the
code name for that 1366 net Nehalem
Nehalem I believe yeah remember when we
did that that Christmas parody at new
egg in his little town of Nehalem yeah
yeah that was my favorite there's still
a little town of the i7 990 X its
extreme edition 3.4 6 gigahertz 6 core
processor yep alright geez
how much is that going for now on Amazon
383 dollars well if you buy it used and
was used on Amazon for 384 dollars hmm
funny how that works
interesting yeah like I said I'm not
that as familiar with the other chips
you mentioned so I could be totally
wrong about that true I would recommend
doing further investigation
indeed but that is gonna conclude for
all the donations oh my God thank you
