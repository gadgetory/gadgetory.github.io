channel today we are taking a closer
look at the GTX 1080 Ti from Nvidia this
is their latest GeForce card and
apparently their greatest geforce card
to have ever hit the market it is
supposed to be the single fastest GPU
currently on the market and we're going
to verify those claims today and see if
they're actually true with a bunch of
benchmarks where I think we've got like
I don't know like 25 benchmark slides or
something lined up today so we're going
to be taking a very very thorough
in-depth look at the performance that
can be had when it comes to gaming on
the gtx 980ti nvidia was also claiming
at their press event week or two ago
during GDC that the gtx 980ti would
perform up to 35% faster than the gtx
1080 I'm hoping it's true I think we're
all wishing for that and more that being
said a few specs or a few details about
the gtx 980ti if you haven't already
heard it's got an MSRP of $700 which has
also reduced the price of the GTX 1082
500 u.s. we've also got very similar
specs to the Titan X all around we've
got the same die GP 102 same chip same
number of CUDA cores 3850 for now I did
want to specify or correct myself from
the unboxing video I did of the TI card
I did assume falsely or wrongfully that
the base clock was going to be 1.6
gigahertz and boost up to 2,000
megahertz potentially that's actually
incorrect the base clock officially in
the reviewers guide that I was given
from Nvidia puts it at 1400 and 80
megahertz with a GPU boost up to fifteen
hundred and eighty-two megahertz and
we're actually going to see if we can
take that a bit further just by maxing
out our power and temperature sliders
and taking taking advantage of GPU boost
that way as well as of course
overclocking the card additionally the
ti model only has one less gig of g5x
memory than the Titan X Pascal so that
puts it at 11 gigs of g5x
and this is actually in videos latest
iteration of gddr5 X memory which gives
it a higher theoretical or effective
bandwidth and that's one of the reasons
why Nvidia is able to make this a faster
card allegedly again from the
press-conference than a tight
Eck's Pascal unfortunately I don't have
a Titan XP on hand so I wasn't unable to
test those claims but I will for sure be
testing it against the gtx 1080 today
we've also got that memory within a 552
bit memory bus interface and also a 7
phase 2x dual FET power design that's
capable of supplying up to 250 amps of
clean power to the GPU which in theory
should deliver a better overclocking
experience with less noise and heat
we'll also be taking a look at acoustics
and thermals in just a bit as a quick
refresher from my unboxing video this
card does feature a single 6 pin and 8
pin PCIe power plug and we've also got a
CVP of 250 watts this is a larger die
with it is the GP 102 we're talking
about after all which means we're going
to be introducing more heat and more
power so the fact that Nvidia is also
claiming this new new sort of revamped
cooler to deliver 5 degrees Celsius
cooler temperatures on the die over the
GT X 1080 out of the box is pretty
impressive and we're going to be testing
those claims as well today the last
thing I want to say before we get into
our testing setup is that all the AI B's
the admin board partners will be
releasing or slated to release their
custom board variants of the gtx 10a v
TI later this year in april so stay
tuned for those and that's also around
the time we should start seeing those
overclocked cards from the admin board
partners as well in terms of the memory
clocks so we're going to be seeing the
gtx 1080 shipped with 11 gigabits per
second memory of gddr5 x as well as the
gtx 1060 which is going to be
overclocked to 9 gigabits per second
however that card is going to be fitted
with the standard g5 x now here's a
quick look at our testing setup the
notable mention being the 7700 K that
we're using and overclocking to 5
gigahertz I wanted to really max out the
IPC's so I favored this chip over
something like in 1869 hundred K with
with a higher core and thread count
because we are testing purely gaming at
this point and I did want to just make
sure that we're running at the fastest
operating frequency so that said why
don't we go ahead and talk about
overclocking really quick now here's a
slide that I whipped up that has a
couple different metrics including clock
speeds temperatures and fan speeds based
on three different profiles of the GTX
10 atti which includes its stock right
out of the box that's the red bar did
such a thing just popped it in and hit
go and then also the the black bar
indicates maxing out the power and
temperature sliders so that we can take
advantage of GPU boost the core clock or
the memory clocks were completely
untouched it was just those power and
temp sliders that were maxed out and
then the full overclock which is the top
gray bar that you see there I dialed in
a pretty pretty decent overclock I think
I got 160 megahertz on the core clock in
terms of awesome offset and then a 350
megahertz offset on the memory clock so
you can just kind of see here the red
bar in particular for the clock speed
the core clock speeds I did want to
mention that it wasn't static at 1,750
mega Hertz it did fluctuate in the 1700s
I saw it dip into the high 1600s and the
low 1800's at some point so it kind of
was just jumping all over the place but
as soon as I maxed out the power and
temp sliders that black bar that's
indicating eighteen hundred and ten
megahertz that was stable and constant
it did not fluctuate from that point and
the same goes for the grey bar once we
fully overclocked the card as far as
temperatures are concerned running stock
out of the box the GTX 1080p I was
operating at 84 degrees Celsius and
maintain that same temperature when we
maxed out the power and temperature
sliders however if you look at the fan
speeds you can see that there was a cost
there in terms of noise emissions so we
actually did have to ramp the fan by
auto fan kicked in went from fifty to
sixty percent and that did create a
little bit more noise in our in my room
now I am testing the card on an open
test bench I don't think at 60 percent
fan speed you could probably hear the
card very well through an enclosed case
especially one that had sound dampening
material however once we fully
overclocked card and release its full
potential the max temp does hit 86
degrees Celsius at which point the fan
ramps up to 65% and just that extra 5%
does make it a lot more noticeable I
would say that you probably need a
really decent sound dampening case in
order to eliminate any sort of noise
from coming within your chassis but on
that note I'm going to let you guys
secure it for yourselves I did do a
quick acoustics test so you can hear the
differences between each of the three
profiles that we're looking at here
so there you guys have the sound test
and just a quick few mentions before we
dive into the benchmarks I was running
the 378 66 Nvidia driver for the GTX
1080 and was using a press release
driver for the GTX 10a BTI that now has
been probably replaced by an official
one up on VG the GeForce drivers website
but Windows 10 64 bit I was testing I
tested all my games at both 1440p and
2160p there was really no point in
testing 1920 by 1080 in this instance
because the gtx 980ti is anticipated to
be so fast that I didn't want to hit or
encounter any CPU bottlenecking
with those lower resolution tests so on
that note slate and gentlemen let's go
ahead and kick it out with 3d mark
firestrike ultra as our first glimpse is
to the performance of the gtx 980ti you
can see just stock out of the box just
absolutely killer ridiculous victory
over the GTX 1080 I'm not going to be
saying any percentages in terms of
performance games until the very end of
all these tests I'm going to be doing an
overall average and that'll be exciting
so here we have just a really nice score
that is a first indication of how we're
going to be faring off in these in these
tests here so ashes of the singularity
at 1440p again we're seeing some pretty
nice some some pretty nice traction for
the GTX 1080i now even at 1440p in a
pretty demanding game like ashes we're
still seeing a CPU bottleneck and that
explains why we're not seeing any
performance gain once we overclock the
ti but that being said we're still
seeing some really nice performance this
game is very playable if you don't mind
dipping into the bottom into the high
30s on the very low-end every once in a
while with those 0.1% lows kicking up
the game before K slightly reduces the
amount of CPU bottlenecking here as we
see the TI overclocked pull just ahead
of the stock TI again just ridiculous
frames over the GTX 1080 through and
through next up we've got battlefield
one at 1440p and no cpu bottlenecking
here or at least very minimal results as
we see quite a wider gap between TI and
overclocked TI 149 frames per second on
average with 0.1% lows sustained in the
low 90s that's pretty impressive guys
and you can just see like going from 108
frames per second with the GT
1082 138 right out of the box we've also
got battlefield 1 at 4k again just
really good results here 81 frames per
second over 58 with GT X 1080 that's of
course with the TI overclocked we've got
doom at 1440p this game is just
absolutely butter with the gtx 1080i
whether you're overclocking or not so
this is I mean this card is 4k capable I
think just right off the bat we can
pretty much say that without even having
to overclock 0.1% loads over 70 FPS when
you're overclocking this thing just an
absolute monster when we go over to GTA
5 at 1440p we're seeing another CPU
bottleneck here there is a pretty much a
stalemate between TI and overclock TI
but again we're seeing favorable frame
rates when we switch it over to 4k we
start to see the game become a bit more
GPU bound once again and the 1080i
overclocked just pulls way ahead of the
GT x 1080 going from 47 frames per
second on average to 63 or 66 depending
if you're dialing in your own OC hitman
1440p another CPU bottleneck 109 frames
per second on average and if we crank
the 4k just stellar performance in the
average frame rates I think the
benchmark just might be a little bit
wonky and that's why we got really low
0.1% lows however still very smooth from
what I could tell looking at the screen
and things like that
moving on to Metro last light at 1440p
we are bottlenecking the CPU once again
it's really no surprise at this point
but still getting very nice frame rates
in the 100 to 150 range
holy moly unless you're talking about
the low end which is still well above 80
frames per second Metro last night at 4k
yield similarly impressive results this
is a very playable game at 2160p you can
see 78 frames per second on average with
sustained lows in the 50s that goes for
the overclocked and the non overclocked
Ti and there's the GTX 1080 falling way
behind just struggling to hang on at
this resolution with frame rates in the
sub 60fps on average and we've got
overwatch at 1440p of course we're
getting ridiculously high frame rates in
this game it's not too demanding to
begin with but of course this is still
very playable at 4k as well it's
reduce a little bit and I believe the
engine in this game is capping the
framerate off at 200 FPS which is
probably why we're not seeing a huge
jump going from 1440p to 20 160 and also
there's probably some elements of CPU
bottlenecking I would imagine we've also
got watchdogs too at 1440p 82 frames per
second on average for our gtx 1080i
overclocked with sustain frames in the
frame rates in the 60s for our low-end
and we've also got the GTX 1080 which is
delivering a playable frame rate all
around but definitely nothing astounding
compared to the GTX 1080p I at 4k the
GTX 1080 is no longer a viable solution
for gamers looking for a smooth gaming
experience we do see the GTX 1080 pull
ahead quite significantly although it's
not quite the crushing performance
victory that we saw with some of our
other games tested watchdogs 2 is a very
demanding title and especially at this
resolution it is playable with the GTX
1080p I more so if you're overclocking
of course however it's not quite as
ideal as some of the other games that
we've run with all those benchmarks run
I've calculated any frames per dollar
that's achievable with each of our
configurations here so we've got the
stock GTX 1080 at the bottom there at
$500 MSRP delivering twelve hundred and
fifty-five frames in total across all of
our games today which yields the highest
FPD in today's test at two point six
seven FPD compare that to the GTX 1080
stock or as I'm sorry 1080p I stock at
$700 MSRP with fifteen hundred and
twenty five frames rendered that gives
us 2.17 FPD so the better value of
course would be then to overclock the ti
still the same price obviously it's the
same MSRP whether or not you're
overclocking and at seventeen hundred
and four frames rendered you're getting
an fpv of two point four three which
isn't quite up to snuff
with the GT X 1080 it's not quite the
value however when you take a look at
that gray bar you can see we're
rendering so many more frames just
across the board that it really depends
on what you're looking for you're
looking for the best value that you can
possibly find at five to seven hundred
dollars or are you looking for the
maximum amount of gaming performance
that's possible within that price range
so now really quick before we close this
video I did want to give you guys one
last look at my D mark which is a very
synthetic application where we saw the
gtx 980ti pull ahead by 35% exactly over
the GTX 1080 in terms of chub factor and
that simply represents the likelihood of
a particular GPU giving the user a
certified chub and this was tested at 4k
with tight pants on and stiffy enabled
so all-around very impressive marks from
the GTX 1080p I overall so now the
biggest question that we have to answer
still remains is the GTX 1080 TI 35%
faster than the GTX 1080 as per in
videos claims let's find out if we take
a look at our performance slide here and
we look at the total number of rendered
frames throughout today's testing the
middle bar that you see here should be
at least 35% faster and 1255 is that the
case no it is not according to today's
tests and although all the benchmarks
that I've run the GTX 1080p I out of the
box is 21.5 percent faster than the GTX
1080 which does fall quite short of
Nvidia's promise the only way that team
green could redeem themselves at this
point is that if by overclocking the GTX
MBTI you were able to achieve at least
35% faster performance over the GTX 1080
but is that the case yes it is
we found thirty five point seven percent
more frames were rendered by
overclocking the GTX 1080i as found with
a stock GTX 1080 and holy smokes guys
this is the fastest single GPU on the
market hands down I haven't even tested
it against the Titan X Pascal but I'm
pretty sure it beats it especially if
you're overclocking and for $700
I know that's not within everyone's
reach it's not even with most people's
reach however if you are looking for a
4k experience and you don't want to have
to deal with SLI or multi-gpu setup and
you've got the money
this card is an absolute beast I mean it
makes the GTX 1080 just kind of met and
the GTX 1080 is a phenomenal card in its
own right the GTX 1080i is just an
absolute menace
of a GPU so Nvidia should be very proud
of themselves perhaps I'll be doing a
update to hot line in the future hot
lines somewhere over there you can't
really see her right now but perhaps
putting two of those pis in hot line
that might have to happen at some point
because damn but there's really not much
else for me to say at this point guys so
let me know what your feedback is I'd
love to hear your thoughts on the TI the
price point if you think it's worth it
what'd you think of the numbers the
performance that we've seen today leave
all your comments and feedback in India
in the comments below obviously and feel
free to toss me a like on the video as
well if you enjoyed it I spent a lot of
time this week benchmarking as you could
probably tell from this video so
hopefully that's appreciated if you guys
like that sort of data then also feel
free to let me know that but that's
going to do it for now guys go ahead and
have yourselves a beautiful day I'm
going to go ahead and get out of here
edit this video no I got to go to Paul's
house and film awesome hardware things
are happening all the time things are
always happening but hope you guys have
yourselves a good day I'll be seeing you
guys in the next video and until next
time goodbye I was a really abrupt and
remember I'm not good with goodbyes
they're just so sad I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
