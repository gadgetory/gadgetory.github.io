2016 is brought to you by need for seat
go to need for seat USA comp for the
ultimate gaming chair experience for
your desk in office and Corsair they
make good products and you should buy
them alright guys so the very last booth
that I stopped at at CES this year was
in wind and the one thing that caught my
eye the most was their new H frame 2.0
this is an upgrade from their original H
frame which debuted back in 2012 I
believe this one's actually going to be
available in q1 in limited quantities as
they often are for in win cases for the
lowly price of 799 USD so quite a pretty
penny but when you take a look at this
thing especially in person you kind of
see why this is a full tower chassis
with an open air design using a full
aluminum frame and it's also got a
beautiful tinted tempered glass side
panel window actually not even a window
the entire side panel is its tempered
glass and it does look absolutely
beautiful it's it's it's also highly
reflective so when the lights inside of
the chassis are off you kind of get a
nice reflection there there is yellow
orange yellowish orange I'd say LED
accent lighting on the outside of the
case with adjustable brightness via some
front panel buttons you get three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator
support at the top and the rig that they
had on display at the show actually had
a pump res combo in there so I'm
guessing there is probably a built-in
pump mount in place of where you
typically find the five and a quarter
inch base so great for water cooling
included with the HRM 2.0 is in winds
limited edition Signature Series s2
power supply this actually uses a
proprietary form factor it's in fact the
only power supply that can be used with
the a-train 2.0 the two are pretty much
hand in hand they're meant to go
together and when you kind of see the
design you sort of see why this is a
1065 watt and fully modular power supply
with an AV plus platinum rating and it's
got aluminum casing with transparent
tempered glass on the side with LED
accents of the same color as the case on
the inside of it so you can kind of see
the the innards of the power supply unit
itself all of these details are really
designed to match the aesthetic of the
atrium 2.0 so well it's definitely
proprietary it does look pretty
fantastic especially in person when its
installed in this chassis so on that
note that pretty much wraps up what I
wanted to say about the H frame 2.0
really cool stuff to look forward to
from n win in 2016 thank you
