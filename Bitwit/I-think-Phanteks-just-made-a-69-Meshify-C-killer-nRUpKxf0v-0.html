brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below is she over
there
getting coffee again why am I even
surprised
hurry up really late oh thank you I love
you again all is forgiven
alright we're going to these guys where
are those guys well they have from the
people who brought you leg introducing
our under Oh invite only are we invited
okay okay we're at the fantex booth in
case you couldn't tell I'm checking out
the new and improved Lux - okay this is
a it's come a long way since we saw it
at CES this year for starters there used
to be the fabric mesh that was along the
sides here they've actually swapped that
out and it's just open air now and they
actually found that you get reduced
thermals by removing that the fabric
mesh is actually really good in certain
applications when there's a large
surface area of it but in this instance
they found that thermals are actually
much improved without it so you still
get dust filtration though pretty much
top bottom and front there's also some
additions with some LEDs you've got RGB
I digital RGB all along here on the
strip kind of very similar to the N
through elite there's also some lighting
strip in here just above that where the
mini ITX board would go if you guys
remember this is a dual system chassis
so there's a lot of flexibility a lot of
options that you can actually play
around with here notice that the side
panel is actually on hinges snaps in
tooless I love to love side panels to
hell with to hell with screws and we
also have just very nice cable
management in here you got one two three
four five of these modular trays that
you can mount SSDs - SSDs are getting
prettier and fancier and decked out with
RGB s more than ever before so it's nice
to show those off you can actually mount
SSDs on the opposite side of them - so
at the same time so that gives you a lot
of connectivity options you can do
mechanical hard drives at the bottom
here there's no cage installed right now
but you get the idea also just
ridiculous amounts of radiator support
that we saw at CES you can do dual 360
and dual 480 at the same time which is
just kind of insane okay notice that
there's a up to 140 mount here better
than mine for for a little bit I'm going
to come back to that and it's going to
blow your mind and we also have on the
here more SSDs raise just just no
shortage of options you can actually
mount to power supplies in this thing if
you want to a lot of this is repeat from
CES if you guys remember you can check
that video out if you want more details
but if you go over here they actually
have some different use case scenarios
of how they've set up the lux to just
depending on what you want to do with it
this is actually a dual system fully
water cooled mini ITX you've got
vertical GPU mounting you'd also met a
vertical GPU here as well but they have
it in a more traditional horizontal
orientation this is what I was talking
about the 140 millimeter fan mount can
actually support this new district
this thing is absolutely beautiful I was
pretty excited when they show this off
to me but even more excited when they
told me that this is compatible with
pretty much any ATX case that has a 140
mount at the back with at least seven
expansion slots this is a game changer
and it's going to make custom water
cooling a lot more easy and efficient
and quite frankly beautiful we also have
this guy over here is more of a massive
workstation build I believe that's the
the dual CPU gigabyte board that's just
absolutely insane
form factor if you can see it it's
perfectly accommodated no modifications
required to actually fit that natively
you also have a revolt Pro here showing
off the power expandability of that
nifty little unit there's there's a hard
drive cage in action kind of see right
there again there's so much flexibility
just in this portion of the of the
chassis alone and then over here we have
just a pure airflow build which is
really nice up to 15 fans which is crazy
it's still surprisingly quiet look at
that bunch of halos on it - oh my god
can I just live can I live in this
computer case it's so hot outside I
never I never want to leave this space
this is super exciting - because these
are cases we have never seen before
which is the p3 60 X so this is built
off of the p3 50 a very popular case
actually same internal layout but you
can see it's got a couple more tricks up
its sleeve including this very nice RGB
digital RGB lighting on the side here as
well as the front panel the front panel
is the biggest redesign here they've
actually got slots it's hard to see but
there's actually two thin slots on
either side that's going to alleviate a
lot of the pressure that was formally
being intake at the top and bottom so
it's supposed to help thermal
significantly there was one of the
shortcomings of the last case but they
seem to have fixed that as well
this is gonna be retailing for $69 and
it's gonna be coming
August as is the lux - from what I've
been told so every pretty much
everything here is coming in August I
just just wait till August and then over
here we have the eclipse series p400 a
actually comes in two flavors black and
white and you can see that this is built
off of the existing p400 also a very
popular case but suffered from some of
the same issues that the P 350 did of
having relatively closed off intake at
the front now it's completely mesh or
mostly completely you've got sort of a
nice stylized
look here but this is completely metal
very high-quality very fine mesh so it
actually acts as a dust filter as well
kind of a multi-purpose thing here still
have a dust filter at the top but looks
really nice and also RGB so this one
actually comes with three RGB fans it's
a little bit more expensive not by much
there's no fan controller included like
there is but this one this one comes
with two fans not RGB these are three
fans digital RGB I believe it's sixty
nine and eighty nine dollars
respectively also coming in August oh I
should also mention that the vertical
GPU bracket design has been revamped
pretty much it's much more optimized the
existing vertical GPU bracket goes in a
lot more easily requires a lot less
hassle than than previously
it also spaces it out quite
significantly from the side panel so you
get fresh intake regardless of the GPU
that you're using whether it be blower
style fan or more of a traditional
open-air now if you're not feeling amped
enough you might consider checking out
the fan ticks amp power supplies this is
a new line alright this is basically
built off of the same existing revolt I
should say quality and design because
they are from sea sonic just like the
revolt series so very high quality
you've got 550 650 and 750 watt it's
actually revolt Pro links certified
which means that you can actually use
these in tandem with the revolt Pro
completely compatible they've been
validated in-house testing and all that
of course there's a lot of existing you
know other vendor related power supplies
that will support the revolt Pro but
these ones are validated by fan tax and
coming from the same see sonic DNA you
can see why they're incredibly reliable
when pairing them in that configuration
the pricing is also very very good here
it goes from eating on here starting all
the way up to one hundred and 999 for
the 750 watt additionally you've got a
hybrid switch here on the back so if you
wanted to do a zero rpm that's under a
thirty percent load fans'll it's been a
completely silent operation which is
very
feature to have we also have a fully
modular design it comes included with
black flat cables which is my favorite
actually I prefer the black flats so
that's the amp line but that's only half
of it that's so why do you guys have so
much stuff over here we have the evolve
shift air air flow plus a thousand I
asked them that is a highly scientific
measurement we have the existing shift
evolved shift which is a beautiful case
actually wifey sauce and I have one of
these in our living room at home however
ours have the original tempered glass on
both sides where as you can see here
they use the fiber mesh this is where
the fiber mesh really excels when it
does have much larger surface area to
work with you can also see the RGB fans
when they on the other side so you don't
quite lose all the transparency that you
get with tempered glass it looks really
nice and this just gives it a lot more
breathability a lot more airflow from
both the GPU and the CPU whether you're
doing partial liquid cooled or air
cooled I mean bear in mind if you're
doing an air cooled system in this case
you're pretty much resorting to a low
profile cooler which doesn't do the best
job all the time of thermal dissipation
but if you have the help of a fully mesh
side panel like this it definitely goes
a long way if you're an existing shift
user these are going to be sold
separately you can add them on it's
completely compatible with the existing
shift or if you want to just buy this
from the get-go completely brand-new you
can buy the shift air with the side
panels included you can also mix and
match if you wanted to have keep glass
on one side mesh on the other can have
your cake and eat it too which is gonna
be great if you want to like keep it a
little bit more acoustically sound if
you have this wedged into the corner of
your living room for example you might
want to put you know the mesh panel on
the side that's facing the wall so it
doesn't really interrupt your viewing
experience here we have the enthu elite
bill that was showed off at CES that is
supporting the ridiculously over built
and over engineered Dominus motherboard
from Asus but you can see that they
still have their custom water block
science and the elite case is pretty
much one of the few cases on the market
that can actually support these
motherboards natively you can see that
they've also got their new and improved
pump pump reservoirs which are very nice
they have a fully transparent backing
now so if you had RGB fans behind them
you could actually still see them pretty
well over here is pretty much the same
thing but they've actually swapped out
the motherboard
for the massive gigabyte board and you
can see that they've actually got custom
water blocks for that board as well so
this can this can all be bought sort of
not as a kit but well these products are
sold separately and they kind of all go
together especially because there's the
revolt pro in here which is doing some
power expansions so we have additional
power very clean power in fact because
with the revolt Pro there's only one ATX
cable that needs to go to the
motherboard instead of two so you're
dealing with independent ripple it's
much more stable power going to the
board and then over here we have a nice
look at the distro block that I showed
you earlier in the lux - absolutely
gorgeous it's kind of showing off you
need that seven expansion slot height in
order for it to work well they've also
got a new and improved water block
system so these are actually covering a
lot more surface area of the motherboard
the entire socket whether you're talking
Intel or AMD is gonna be pretty much
just fully populated with digital RGB
now that wasn't there before and this is
just gonna help eliminate some of the
gap between the actual water block and
the vrm heat sinks on the board just to
give it a more seamless look it almost
kind of looks like a mono block
especially the AMD one looks very nice
we also have new and improved blocks in
this style the glacier Radeon seven and
r-tx
2070 both of those cards will be
supported by these blocks the blocks
will pretty much look like this
regardless of if you go AMD or Nvidia of
course there will be some slight
differences and on the bottom as well
and here's another look at the glacier
ar160 see the pump reservoir is that
have those translucent transparent
backings and also digital RGB very nice
fan tax is also showing off their
metallic gear cases these are the the
silent - the Neo silent cases that we
actually already saw at CES they're
they're setting off again just so we can
get another look but over here we
actually have the V two versions of the
Neo cases and the og neo mini Neo micro
and neo v2 the nice thing about these
cases that they haven't really changed
the very simple minimalistic and classy
look of them internal layouts pretty
much the same as well although they have
improved it in one big way by actually
making the front panel a little bit
further away from the fan so you get
increased airflow also I believe these
these ventilation slots are quite a bit
bigger than they were before which was
pretty much one of my very few gripes of
of the the v1 cases so now that that's
improved I'd love to do some AV
comparison testing to see how much of a
difference that makes but so far it's
looking pretty promising
everyone holding their breath
I'm checking you checking you did you
make a wish
yes that's that's why you hold your
press is to make the wish come true you
see you have to deal with on these trips
dude is pouring rain right now I am so
glad we have cars play where we going
right now man gang okay Nanjing is the
main show for two main Exhibition Centre
for company were just a hotel there's
some vendors that that's exhibit there
but where we're going right now is where
the main goods are so wait who are we
seeing next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
