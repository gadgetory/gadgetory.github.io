Coolermaster is a computer case unlike
any other that has the unique ability of
stacking multiple systems together so
why would anyone ever need to do this
well click on the screen to watch the
video I made about it it'll change your
life forever no you're awesome
just stop what's the video how's it goin
everyone welcome back to the channel so
back when I was putting my x99 test bed
together I asked you guys which 4k
monitor I should get for benchmarking
and day-to-day productivity and right
away many of you guys named dropped to
the Crystal Pro UHD display from
monoprice so I can fight it in your
suggestions I don't know why and managed
to secure one for the studio well after
nearly 2 weeks of daily use I think I'm
finally confident in my own opinion of
it to conduct a proper review so
starting off with what's in the box you
get the monitor and stand DC power cord
and adapter do League DVI cable 3.5
millimeter auxilary cable end users
manual one of the outstanding features
about this monitor is that it can do 4k
at 60 Hertz using a DisplayPort
connection so you can kind of imagine my
disappointment upon realizing a
DisplayPort cable was not included
luckily the DisplayPort cable I ordered
from monoprice came with both ends the
monitor features a 28 inch TN panel with
a native Ultra HD resolution of 3840 by
2160 and an 8-bit color resolution
resulting in just over 1 billion colors
gamers will also benefit from the
displays one millisecond greater gray
response time courtesy of that twisted
nematic engineering you get an OK
contrast ratio of a thousand to one and
a generous viewing angle of up to one
hundred and seventy degrees the screen
itself is lined with the thin layer of
tempered glass which is advertised as
being anti glare which I can only assume
as a marketing term meaning highly
reflective at the very least reflections
are hardly noticeable when you're
dealing with lighter backgrounds but
jump into a game or a movie with dark
environments and you've got yourself a
spare mirror
hopefully monoprice plans to release a
matte screen model in the future so I
can once again be unaware of how bad my
posture is when gaming a three and a
quarter inch bezel surrounds the top and
sides of the screen and a thicker bottom
bezel in brushed aluminum adds a touch
of stylish Flair in the lower left
corner is a non-intrusive power LED that
lights up orange when in standby and
turns blue
when active in the center is some
tasteful monoprice branding and on the
right are seven physical buttons for
power menu select up and down brightness
and volume adjustment the menu is easy
to navigate and offers up some basic
functionality like picture and color
options but nothing higher level to
indicate this monitor is targeted at
photo and video professionals you do
however get picture and picture and
picture by picture functionality for
quicker windows multitasking a feature
well-suited for a 4k display while the
physical buttons are nice to have I
found them to be on the stiff side and
the monitor couldn't help but wobble as
I navigated the menu I would have also
liked to see a dedicated button for
input select for quicker switching
between video sources the rear enclosure
of the monitor uses a matte black
plastic construction that feels solid
with a 100 by 100 base amount in case
you wish to mount this panel to the wall
or even another stand for video inputs
you get two HDMI 1.4 ports that support
MHL and are capable of driving 4k but
only at 30 Hertz so you really want to
be using one of the two DisplayPort 1.2
connections to really take full
advantage of this panels capabilities
apart from that you get a dual link DVI
port and a 3.5 millimeter jack so you're
given the option of having your computer
source audio come through the monitors
two built-in speakers of course like
most monitor speakers it's probably best
to avoid ever using them now moving on
to my personal favorite part of this
monitor is its four dimensional stand
which features generous adjustments for
height tilt two hundred and something
degrees swivel and ninety degree
rotation for portrait mode the only
bummer here is that the monitor can't
really raise high enough to clear the
desk when rotating so you end up having
to actually first tilt the panel before
doing so
but overall the stand is outstanding
because it glides wherever you want it
to there are no funky Springs or latches
you have to pull to get it going it just
works really well so now that I've
covered the main features of this
monitor from head to toe how does it
stack up in terms of raw usage and
performance well for one when it comes
to 4k in general I think everyone can
agree on the benefits of having more
screen real estate for productivity and
lack thereof the extra pixels also make
for a sharper movie and gaming
experience assuming you have the GPU
horsepower to drive them additionally
the one millisecond response time
reminded me why it's the new standard
for high-end gaming monitors these days
as the reduced motion blur when playing
games gave me noticeably cleaner visual
on my daily IPS panel however my
unhealthy habit of media consumption
could have been much more enjoyable have
the tempered glass just not been there I
don't particularly enjoy watching myself
during every scene of World War Z and
seeing my face backs the Brad Pitt
certainly doesn't do anything for my
self-esteem the color reproduction is
nothing to write home about but it does
fall right in line with other TN panels
currently on the market contrast ratio
could be improved in future models as I
was hoping to see a wider gap between
blacks and whites I was pleased to see
that the monitor exhibits perfect
backlighting distribution with no
visible hotspots like you sometimes see
on those Korean IPS panels so to sum up
where does all of that
leave my final opinion of the Crystal
Pro 4k well despite my hate-hate
relationship with the tempered glass
panel having the ability to enjoy for
Kade 60 Hertz makes this monitor one of
the more compelling options at its price
point of just 500 bucks personally I
feel that mainstream gaming still isn't
quite ready for 4k F but if you're so
inclined I think you'll be happy with
that next level sharpness and response
time if you're content with playing at
60 Hertz well I wouldn't recommend it
for hardcore professionals in need of
stellar color reproduction I could
definitely see this monitor making life
a lot easier for folks in search of more
screen space we're having two monitors
side by side just isn't practical all in
all this is a sign of good things to
come from on a price as long as they
continue to listen to user feedback and
uphold the reputation of value and
quality speaking of monitors you should
monitor today's sponsor with interest
it's lynda.com where they have awesome
HD online tutorials where you can learn
things like game design or cloud
computing or How to Train Your Dragon
wait no not that last one but their site
really is a great resource if you're
like me and can't understand half of the
tutorials on YouTube these days because
they're either poorly done or the person
in the video looks like Charlie Brown
it's very distracting so check it out
I'll put a link in the description below
where you guys can try it for free using
my special link yeah but that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
