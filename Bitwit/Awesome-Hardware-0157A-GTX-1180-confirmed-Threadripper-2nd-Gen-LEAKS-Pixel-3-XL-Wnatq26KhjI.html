done everything's gone wrong also it was
I was getting other messages and stuff
that were distracting me yeah other
people's fault but we're live now so
hello greetings everyone thank you so
much for waiting patiently in chat
patiently in quotes this is a live news
show this is awesome
friggin hardware episode 157 the
techadon news show that Paul and I like
to stream every single Tuesday at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time we love to spend its
entirety on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware
welcome twitch hope you're all well hey
guys and hello to the youtube crew who's
watching right now on my channel we'd
like to break this show on YouTube up
into into two halves so today we're
actually streaming on my channel first
and about an hour or so will switch over
to pulse channel you can find a link to
his stream in the description below
thank you guys so much for being here we
like to have a few adult beverages on
stream just to loosen things up keep it
casual and because beer is delicious
today we're drinking clown shoes
chocolate sombrero it's amazing when you
can find a clown shoes beer in a
six-pack of cans it's just wow welcome
to 2018 people looking forward to this
oh yeah this is a really good stuff if
anyone's noticing the audio I know it's
not the greatest right now sorry about
that we have to have the ACN right now
cuz it's the middle of summer and it's
Southern California and it's hot outside
it's hot as balls and we would rather
not die hot balls so apologies but you
can still hear us right sure you can
sure okay um speaking of balls
occasionally we'll say words that are
even more defense offensive and abrasive
louwman to that or nude or we're just
playing downright uncouth downright
uncouth that that sounds like a curse
word right there yes but so just a
warning adult language does become part
of the stream occasionally so if you
have little ones around make sure that
they're not listening unless you're cool
with that sort of thing and that's you
know you're the parent I'm gonna tell
you how to do your job yes your kid say
autumns a whisper all the f words just a
lullaby of
just read them that samuel l.jackson
book it's gonna hear him eventually go
to go the f to sleep that's a classic
that's what that's what i'm gonna read
my kids when they're when they're in
existence it's not familiar with that
one actually oh it's great it's great
Cheers cheers to all of you thank you so
much for being here
mm-hmm and sorry I really you know we we
do the show as a team but I gotta say
that was close fit is totally totally my
felt this times little opal but you can
buy stuff from our store buy things you
know if you're mad at us for being late
maybe if you give us money you'll feel
better but you get awesome merchandise
in return yeah money yeah exchange I
feel like you guys are really you guys
ruined the real winners here we just get
money geez currency for goods in certain
buttons Lane but you can't find that
stuff anywhere else you can only find my
stuff on bit with Don tech all right
shirts hoodies bottle openers desk mats
glasses the whole shebang people
everything you need to survive yeah just
just buy one of everything and I will
love you unconditionally because no one
else you can also buy stuff from my
store what else hardware not net once
you're done buying stuff from coaster
pulsar we're done that also buy one of
everything from his site yeah or he'll
cry it's all good thing you don't want
to see Paul cry it's not pretty I
recommend this bottle opener good for
opening bottles it is does what it says
you could also it could also cut someone
or you can take a picture of it cut him
good okay sorry will yell Johnson at you
at the end of the show a little
tradition that we'd like to do here some
people find it offensive which is why we
keep doing it thanks for the host April
Ãºltima Oh Thank You April yeah what a
what a charmer that April oh god what's
happening to my computer oh I don't know
yours is updating both my my laptop
decided to do a windows update in my
ideal time once again and my Chrome just
decided to take a poop yeah that was odd
ah okay maybe a research decoding error
that sounds perfectly normal that's
totally normal okay so our first topic
for today Windows updates now at 42
percent completion I have been advised
not to turn off my PC because this will
take a while Kyleigh your thoughts um
you know Paul I think I think this has
been a long time coming
we didn't really have any signs there
were no warning signs of this update
happening it wasn't very nice to to sort
of get a warning at first or maybe even
opt out of an update right now would
have been great if you could just
postpone that update you know what where
these updates coming from what do they
want should we fear me maybe they'll
give us that information and a future
update I would not be surprised at this
point but we also have other news
articles to talk about that have
breaking news still at 42% oh it just
jumped to 50 we are now at 51 people 1
ok well in and we went back down to 45
we are we are now we are now on updating
that has never happened we are now just
went from 51 to 45 I've never seen it go
backwards
neither have I does that mean it was
it's rolling back there an hour 46 your
your fake news story just became real
news your your half of the show has been
so packed first three minutes so worth
the wait guys alright let's dive into
our first segment here our first segment
is a new which is a sort of new segment
brand new segment like never we've never
even had a segment that's remotely close
to this we've never talked about stories
anything like these stories no
absolutely because apparently there are
these things called leaks leaks and so
we thought maybe knowing what leaks are
would give a devote a whole segment to
the leak base segment leak based see you
can tell how familiarized we are with
leaks by the graphics we put in our new
lower thirds so I really like the new
lariat lower third scale put that
together why thank you very much Paul
this is what I do in my free time that's
that's what some of my finest work
actually and we're finally done with
Windows updates at least for the first
round will see this restart quick of
splash beat so this first article is
from video cards and in case you guys
were honestly curious this is about like
actual leaks not the vegetable like like
scandalous top-secret Snowden leaks okay
glad we understand cpu-z screenshots
were leaked leaked maybe just one speak
of a threat refer 2990 WX as that's
interesting what is that I think this is
the first time we've heard of that skew
here on the show but it's reporting 32
cores and 64 threads which we have heard
uh in the past several rumors have have
tried to hey well no that's that's not a
rumor AMD has kind of a nerdy so ok
that's confirmed back on sheet X ok that
surrender for to will feature a 32 core
variant I see I knew it was confirmed to
me but I just so paranoid as ever that
is in the public dropping something
that's not ok alright so we can release
a that at least a 32 core and 64 thread
makes sense as far as the model number
we don't really know that's that's all
kind of leak and rumor based it is
running at 4.1 gigahertz or at least it
seems to be at this very moment the
screenshot was taken and this is in
precision boost mode so it could very
well just be one core that's showing a
4.3 Hertz clock speed we don't know what
the W stands for there doesn't seem to
be much light shed on that point in this
article we do know that this was being
tested on MSI's X 399 any G creation
which is a new X 399 motherboard surely
developed purely for this launch of
second gen thread Ripper how do we know
that it's just listed in the article
apparently this is just coming from the
source who who leaked this so it's just
as uncertain as the leak itself but take
it with a grain of salt people any
speculation as to what the W might stand
for in WX feel free to let us know
please please feel free to discuss and
chat
we will be sure to 2990 WX 2990 WX wax
wax
what's Wix Oh God Wix has gotten ahold
of a and B now ambhi's even doing their
crappy infomercial slant wanks wanks
that's that's a whole different thing
called we can that's a whole different
segment entirely that's a different show
chat suggesting different channel
wookiee watergate wicked watermelon what
what watermelon whiskey I like that one
why is it why isn't the Andy wizened
thread ripper
WX why is it not what o so many great
theories in chat I'm so glad I asked you
guys divided Windows Update just
disables every critic connected
peripherals and you have to you have to
use use the Tobii eye tracking now for
all of your desktop browsing needs
hands-free that's the way that's the
future cursor is now controlled by your
eyes alright so let's move on to the
other leak here leak leak number two
from hot hardware this is also about
second gen thread Ripper but also
includes the Intel Core i 9 8 core cpu
known to us as the 9900 k there's a
Cinebench throwdown leak here so it's
actually kind of comparing both second
gen thread upper and a core ID now it's
interesting here is that the model name
if you look in the the Cinebench stores
thread ripper 2990 x there's no w
so if if one of these are correct well
it just shows that only one of these
leaks can be correct
it's either 2990 X or 2990 WX or it's a
third option that isn't listed here and
they're both fake we don't know but it
does confirm that this 2990
whatever that is gonna be a 32 core
processor thanks Microsoft I was hoping
to have a Microsoft edge link on my
desktop oh Jesus
they just planted it there didn't it
yeah laughing that system tray at least
at any rate some pretty impressive
scores if this is all to be true $63.99
is the top scorer at four point one two
gigahertz on the 32 core rise in
threaded processor i'm interestingly 4.2
gigahertz when they went when it was
running at that speed is actually
returning the lowest score at 60 109
article speculating that this could be
due to some thermal throttling gravely
maybe inadequate cooling things of that
nature which makes perfect sense we also
have the 8 core 16th red 9900 k or what
we would assume would be the I 999
hundred K here it's listed as the CPU
zero zero zero zero which is potentially
in the indicative of an engineering
sample that perhaps hasn't gotten the
latest micro code update and so it's
just not being recognized by the
software that's perfectly reasonable
explanation at 20 212 again these are
multi-threaded scores so of course an 8
core CPU is not really gonna compete
much with a 32 core behemoths like the
2nd gen right over here so um what else
can we say what else can we really say
to your question Kyle other than nothing
we will all will be revealed hopefully
within a few weeks maybe a month or so
both on the team red and team blue camps
when they inevitably release these
highly anticipated CPU families I
thought I thought it Computex that AMD
said
dhurpa 2 is coming in july or august i
thought it was one of those ok so yeah
it's memories and I remember it's kind
of fuzzy so I don't I would just assume
a lot of the leaked websites I've been
reading there's like it's coming in
August it's coming it seems like a lot
of stuff is coming in August again I
haven't really heard anything straight
from the horse's mouth
but we
and we can always help it makes sense to
I feel like audist is a very popular
time for big launches like this because
it's right before the huge holiday rush
things like you know Black Friday and
Christmas obviously so it's it's a good
guess the very least but thank you hot
hardware for that article and let's talk
about our final at third leak for today
which is also from a hot hardware they
were just hot with the leaks today pixel
three XL I know me and Paul are probably
interested in this maybe more than most
because we're both pixel owners and we
are very happy with our pixel experience
thus far this one is clearly leaking the
clearly white model with four gigs of
RAM and 64 gigs of storage as indicated
by some of the details that you can see
in the leaked pictures here there's two
pictures one of the front screen and one
of the back from the front piece screen
looks all blurry and pixelated kappa i
think that's obviously a manufacturing
defect death is definitely not a
manufacturing defect paul that is
clearly someone who's blurred out the
the information there because this is
after all a leak hence the segment leaks
and we also have those interesting some
great branding on that segment so far i
know i'm killing it right now there is a
display knotch on the front of the phone
sort of conforming to a lot of the other
popular flagship phones the iPhone X and
others not just stupid I hate the match
I I don't mind the knotch
I think I think the notch is easy to
hate because it's different and new and
people have change but you know what
here in natural over you not sure and
then we've got the bottom of the screen
which looks to be a bit more filled out
there's not as big of a bar that this is
a pixel to here I can I can turn my
phone on and make sure there's no super
important information here but there are
demonstrations definitely there's
definitely a big black bar at the bottom
here that's just kind of got a speaker
and they've forgotten that for for gone
that with more screen real estate which
I like no no obvious details on you know
the screen resolution or anything but
does look like it has a downward
firing speaker or at least the bottom
mounted speaker the notch it's got dual
facing cameras this is like a great
facing speaker it does look like a front
facing I would prefer the front space
facing the speaker's I don't like the
bottom firing this is that's that's one
thing I don't like about the original
pixel itself is the speakers on the
bottom yeah it works okay if you can cup
it right and Kenna door deflects so in
specific scenarios it's fine but overall
I prefer the front facing I ever the HTC
One just the front facing speakers have
always made the most sense to me I
actually don't mind either or I feel
like if you have the front facing
speakers you're right it's it's going
facing it's going straight to your ears
but if it's a downward firing speaker I
personally don't mind it because the way
that I hold my phone usually usually
causes the the sound to sort of echo in
my hand a little bit call me crazy but
it kind of just dis cupping the bottom a
little bit kind of creates a more echoey
effect which you can't do on a front
facing speaker and sometimes it can help
project if you're you know showing a
clip to some friends or something like
that but I think Paul the article says
downward firing so if they are right
about that then that could just be the
the mouth of the microphone for when
you're making phone calls but I don't
this this line right here looks to me
like the like it looks exactly like this
neck like the speaker on yours right and
my wife's and so this yeah that must be
the microphone on the bottom most likely
right I don't know but you bring up a
good point because there's also no
picture of the bottom of the phone so
how would the article author know that
it was a downward fireman all the points
that bring up are good except that one
you're right I didn't respond the way
you asked about at all but I mean I
think it's it's safe to say that this is
all still up in the air because some of
the looks of these pictures experts have
weighed in and said this very much looks
like a prototype and these features
could very well change nothing is
sentenced don't at this point this is
just a really early perhaps prototype
sample that
images of now and all this information
was leaked on the leaked segments on the
leaked segments you heard it here first
unless you've read any of these articles
before you watch this thanks for
watching leaked yeah you have a leak on
us have three leaks on us Ackley hope
you have a long hard leak so okay good
stuff about the pixel in the back of it
you know there's a camera cool oh is
that so is there anything else too
the other thing is that there's there's
a camera on the back as well and a
fingerprint scanner also in the middle
on the back which you know revolutionary
I like and that's it that's all for
leaks yeah you can expect the pixel
three to arrive and the pixel three XL
to arrive sometime in October of this
year very exciting and that is late you
have just been leaked on that's that's
that's the just the ending slogan we're
gonna end in the show and we just took a
statement with and you just know we just
know yeah you've been leaked on I guess
that makes more sense when you try it
when you're trying to make something
like that it has to make some sense
right like and we just took a leak on
you and we just took a leak on you that
might be a little on the nose very like
yeah - okay say or how about how about
we start the segment by saying take a
leak on us because you know we're we're
giving them the leaks you know I have to
take a leak on us you know they all
these are good ideas I think oh yeah
we're still think we should you know
we're evolving
that's it yeah constant evolution growth
is always speaking of constant evolution
we have we're gonna help people evolve
their pcs into better looking pcs in
this segment that we just segue to
brilliantly PC no baby oh wait now this
is in this segment it is a new segment
no I think it was only doing this is a
new segment this is kind of like abroad
then my do you have the lower third my
segways tarnished fish
it was so close because i thirsty when
you said we're gonna help your pcs look
better I was like well not quite look at
my PC I didn't realize this alright so
sorry to read the whole thing today's
other news sake I apologize for the
terrible segue I'll give you a web
Redemption right okay apologies my segue
was poorly timed misconstrued we just we
just lost 500 really we need to
transition we're gonna gracefully
transition though from this segue
apology into a brand new segment the
Kyle came up with actually have a pretty
damn good idea what which is like a
simple idea that I'm surprised
super idea I think we didn't think
upstairs so you've all seen Pitt my PC
where people send in pictures and we
critique them and tell them how to make
them look prettier it's a very good
segment this segment is pimp my PC part
picker list wait we have a lower thing
it sure is Paul yes it is
so here we're gonna take prospective pcs
not to be too literal it literate in but
that people maybe are considering buying
so people are going to send us the PC
part picker list of a PC that there may
be about to build about to drop the
hammer drop dime pull the trigger pull
the trigger out spend the cash show
checkout jump the chicken no there's
nothing else to do invest money in
anyway so we're gonna take a look at
your PC particular so you gotta tell you
if they're good or not
absolutely okay that was a good recovery
from your appalling segue initially
thank you for that pun that was
that's that's Paula ji accepted
okay what's sitting on that one for a
while
it's I'm gonna strike okay like how can
I make your name into a punch you can't
stand it it's Mike my name's unbundle
your Oh
I'll think of something you give me time
all right my givers Center see one of
her first come on Mike this that you did
you bet these Cal or these I did bet
them briefly right um I also linked to
their tweet because sometimes they have
interesting information relevant
information okay says he's planning to
reuse power supply in GPU and he
recently found great deals on an r7 1700
at the same price as an r5 2600 X and
samsung 960 Evo 240 gig drive I also
have some hard drives lying around which
will add up to about one and a half
terabytes groovy all right so we're
looking at about $1,100 overall cost
here okay so he's looking at an 8 core
1700 but he's saying for same price
about the same price he's a 2500 X 27
2600 X sorry 2600 X right okay cool
which is wait is the 2600 x8 course
though no it's not net 6 course it's at
a 1600 successor
not some great deals on the art 717 it
right so he's planning to get the 1700
credit so sorry just clarifying yeah so
go with the eight core if you're
considering if you're on the fence
between the six core in the a court go
with the eight core right we got a be
450 motherboard these just launched
today they sure did way to go PC fare
picker being on top of that Vulcan team
Vulcan I believe this is rising
compatible ddr4 three.js good speed turn
reporting against SD turn fifty Gass the
gtx 1066 gig and our Asian tech case I'm
not familiar with this case but I don't
like to critique a case that I haven't
used any ninety comets in the case I
haven't worked with many rage and tech
cases okay I feel like they're a good
budget option but they are budget and at
least at least some of them but they had
you have some higher end ones but I'm
not sure about their budget cases really
and the 650 watt power supply that he
says he already has so the only thing
I'm looking at here is for 8 $1100 piece
PC gtx 1066 gig
this is an expensive gtx 1066 gig I feel
like for ya 40 right you can't get a
like you get 7 in the 250 to $300 range
a 1070 would only cost you maybe 60
bucks more yeah that's that's probably a
better bet is maybe looking at spending
just a just a smidge more yeah crank it
up to about 400 bucks spend on that
graphics card and maybe upgrade to
attend 70 other than that I think you
have a very nice assortment of parts
here and question why the two SSDs 240
50 gig I would think you'd only need one
of them for a boot drive we got an OD of
me we've got an nvme drive here stick
with that one
ditch the mush look 960 Evo these are
about the same price which is
interesting
yeah get two of these he can't fit like
you don't have to have two of them but
what I can find
but I would you need a single 250 ish
gig SSD if not for a boot drive look
we've got dueling got two on the
motherboard get to get to them two's
rather than the anti gather than the and
when he said he has some additional
storage lying around but yeah he's gonna
include the hard drives later that he's
already got yeah for this price I would
use this one alright here's another
thing this is a 240 gig SSD 405 dollars
you can get a 240 gig SSD for fifty-five
dollars right now this is very
overpriced yeah you should be able to
spend $50 less on this so don't get
locked in on this spend less on that SSD
$50 less on it on this SSD and give
yourself additional as is the storage
that's fast but you're not spending the
same prices on the nvme SSD apply that
to the graphics card to give yourself
ten seventy and you're good
golden moving on thanks Mike perfect
alejandro alejandro little first friend
cool and he likes the our idea for the
segment build for the friends on another
rise in build 2600 so we got a six core
building for 170 and that's a salt price
for the so here's here's the real
dilemma for the kind of mid-range budget
builder right now if you're on rise in
which you kind of should because intel
stuff really isn't I don't know it's
it's not selling me right now yeah the
2600 for 170 the 1600 for 150 or the
1700 for 210 220 if you can find the
1700 on sale because it drops below 200
sometimes definitely scoop that up
absolutely other than that though it's
it's perfectly legit to get the 2600 for
170 versus these it's only 20 bucks more
than 1600 ok so X 470 motherboard 455
bucks this is the Asus Prime that's a
soft by the board but why X 470
he's may have one grab potentially so
he's got a 2600 I imagine he's
potentially going to overclock it 2600
instead of the 2600 X here you're
spending your money on this knowing it's
unlocked and it's a reasonable option to
get yourself 2600 X speeds with a decent
overclocking motherboard it seems seems
a bit pricey 155 bucks just to overclock
Rison seems seems like something you do
on the Intel platform right now personal
opinion be 450 is supposed to have very
adequate overclocking capabilities
probably depending on the board
depending on the board I mean yeah but
what I'm saying is you could probably
get a very similar overclocking
experience with a decent be 450 board
that's gonna cost you quite a bit less
than this X 470 board III feel like X
470 is really only reserved for if
you're trying to really like squeeze
like the 99.999% of potential out of
your out of your CPU and you're willing
to spend quite a bit extra for that
diminishing return or if you're gonna go
multi-gpu so you could potentially shave
some cost overall by getting it a less
expensive motherboard support that I
just used for my $800 build is an X 370
motherboard from Ezra X 370 sli AC which
is $100 and has decent power delivery
for overclocking that said this is a
solid mid-range motherboard and I feel
like 150 mother dollar mother Bryce and
I don't know I I'm more ok with it I
mean especially if you don't dabble with
overclocking but yes you could shave you
can also save some money off there and
then apply it towards your CPU and get
the 1700 and have a cores and 16 threats
so that's another possibility right your
memory kit is a solid choice here
assuming this is a compatible or
incompatible memory kit which I'm not
positive you should double check him out
yeah
your motherboards qvl list but we're not
going that and that in depth in this
segment otherwise it'll take way too
long
240 GB SSD 1 terabyte hard drive here
what are you doing my god he's getting
antsy he is a little antsy GT X 1080
fractal mesh if I see and a 750 watt
power supply first but also you're
spending a good amount on you don't need
that much wattage you could maybe shave
10 20 bucks off and still get an 80 plus
gold modular power supply yeah even from
EVGA 550 to 650 Watts is what I would
look at so yeah there's a little room
with the few parts you have here overall
I think you have a very nice assortment
yeah I agree
yeah so so good job ok there's a $20
mail-in rebate on that power supply
better there is so he switch which
brings it down to 80 which is still
expensive no it brings it down to like
50 no no no it's a hundred Oh seventy
seventy nine oh okay good yeah yeah yeah
that's true okay next up your shrimp for
an HTP cvrs system dream again horizon
interesting you know about 2016 system a
$1200 system all right we got an
aftermarket cooler the crank c7 I have
heard varying reports on the Craig seven
when applied to a risin processor I have
not tested it myself so please go and
look at them maybe find some articles
that have been written that have
directly tested this but I've heard that
the c7 doesn't do much better than the
stock cooler
he might be choosing that because if you
look at the case no - OH - okay so the
Wraiths fits doesn't
alright no rainbow - is so great then ok
a CPU if it's needed for that then that
makes sense
another be 450 Motherwell like I feel
like there's a lot of people just right
on top of it with the be 450 launching
you you know again a 16 gig memory kit
this is the Corsair Vengeance kit that
is extremely popular and extremely
compatible oh yeah
hundred seventy-five yeah that's about
what I would expect it to be right now
500 gig hard drive
SSD well that's this I'm sorry that's an
SSD the WD blue I said WD blue I forgot
I forgot about the blue SSDs you know
all right I'm gonna get 400 bucks is a
base right does that say never in view
man if we can say that but I think that
we need black to be honest it is SATA
alright so yeah that's reasonable I mean
for a million TX m dot - makes a lot of
sense yeah whether you're going piece a
here ok GTX 1080 and alright so it's
gonna be a killer system man in a very
small package I it's all how to use it
so the 1080 should be okay with the
power supply I don't and I do not know
about the power supply that's included
with this bronze it's brought it's a
bronze rated importance but their loss
if you're not overclocking heavily than
if at all you should be fine okay if you
really want to push the limits of your
card and your CPU though and you want to
overclock consider buying the no - OH -
without the power supply and adding your
own because you can five five fifty you
might as well go 550 it's a sfx it's
just an SMS sx power supply right yeah
yeah so that probably my that'd probably
be my one suggestion as well as maybe
maybe a little power supply upgrade is
note to it - without the power supply i
don't know what that cost was in eighty
ninety bucks
the idea so you probably spends 30 $40
more so it's gonna be your call and
whether or not you want to do that but I
will say for an HTP see that might be on
all the time
upgrading your pair of supply it's like
a gold rated one will actually save you
long-term on your pallet your actual
power bill because it'll it'll just
it'll use less power with the more
efficient power supply and if it's an
HTPC that's on all the time then that
might be something to consider we got
one more I wrote one more from pyro the
computer he's been wanting to build for
the last six months cool all right
I wonder if this has been an evolving
thing hmm
oh we got an Intel chip finally all
right 100 no no case Q not overclockable
but we also have the Navy GAC LC 280 and
an RG Strix ceased 3 Z 370 e I have 16
gigs of Corsair Vengeance ddr4 3200
speed memory a 500 gig I'm sorry an MX
500 one terabyte total SSD Asus GTX 1070
Ti that's the Strix card and a 760 T
Corsair case with an 850 watt EVGA
supernova power supply ok and some some
fans of course they're alright I think
the first thing that I would point out
is that you have a non overclockable CPU
but you're spending a little bit extra
on a Z series motherboard as well as
over $100 on a cool and on a cooler
which isn't really necessary a 280
cooler nonetheless for a CPU that you
can't even overclock so I think you
either want to get an 80 700 K and yeah
everything makes sense or if you really
want that 8,700 then you reduce your
cooler to something a bit more moderate
and then you also go with like a B 360
motherboard and save a lot of money yeah
quite a bit of money this is a $200
motherboard a lot of the features of
this motherboard are gonna be kind of
wasted if you're not bothering with some
overclocking there
tweaking or that kind of thing this is
an expensive motherboard at 200 bucks
for this platform you could probably get
away with something a little bit cheaper
there's just I think there's a ton of
ways you could potentially shave some
dollars off something off of this build
so let's yeah as a two thousand dollar
build yeah let's assume let's assume you
want to just upgrade that 8702 and how
do you work he's going for the look here
he's going for the look he's got the
nice nice memory with the RGB the brand
spankin new Vengeance RGB he's got a
nice motherboard and in case hi I'm case
I mean you know if you have the money
and you you want the look you want 8700
K is about 350 350 versus the 8700 at
320 so we only need $30 so like
literally you'd be much better off
buying a $50 air cooler saving 20 bucks
and going with the 8700 k if you want
the liquid cooler they'll like get a get
a slightly less expensive motherboard
maybe and apply 30 bucks toward your CPU
to get a upgrade your CPU your memory
kit is a little on the expensive side
it's vengeance is this this is RGB all
right a little bit more for their energy
when you ask it if that's what you want
okay one terabyte SSD per want for 200
you can maybe get some cheaper than this
right now SSD prices have been dropping
pretty pretty substantially for for over
$500 you should be getting a GTX 280
yeah
not a 10-7 TTI your case that's an
expensive case 170 dollars there's tons
of really good case options around 100
bucks the very full-featured so you can
save some money there if you love that
case though then then go for
don't let us hold you back on that and
then you've got an 850 watt power supply
which again is just way overkill even
like 750 watt is plenty 650 watt is the
total is still totally adequate even for
a 1080 Ti yes 650 watts is okay so you
can shave some money off there too you
could bring this entire system down to
closer closer to 1500 I think and still
have the same performance yeah or even
more if you get the case you so
hopefully some of those suggestions are
helpful for you best if I see them I
like that that's good cake every case
and that is those are all the things pip
maybe see perfect list what did you
think of the segment what did you guys
think of this thing it's good I thought
it was coming you know what's cool about
this segment is that we can take a look
at completely different builds that
wouldn't necessarily work for pimp my PC
like the htpc VR rig like you can't
really pimp it's harder to pimp out
Jesus like like I know the - I'm gonna
see if he needs di maybe he needs - okay
take your shoe in your water cool
alright so moving on public catch up
I'll fill them in let's do some tech
news where is this is this I was a thing
tech news
okay we have one two three four five
articles for my half in this segment and
then we'll break it off to donations and
stuff
whoa Paul's monitor is going nuts what's
happening Oh your monitors freaking out
what's it doing it's just like a bunch
of like like interlaced lines just going
nuts
nothing I literally I literally clicked
on news and then I was like that's it
and I literally clicked on you I don't
do anything
DICE's I have to take a picture of this
since we did Jesus yeah I know sensitive
information turn it off and back on
again oh my god it usually fixes
everything so what we live for technical
troubleshooting so what's next news okay
news oh we're talking about Logitech and
their recent acquisition or their
process of acquiring Blue Microphones
yeah for a hundred and seventeen million
cash just a big how do they deliver that
like that's always my quest just just a
bag of money
I mean I know it's probably just a wire
transfers like that but I always imagine
you imagine is it in cash you guys have
to imagine that like physical school
money dollar bills dolla dolla belt like
ones in ones that's been singles we cut
it in 17 million single one dollar bills
that they have to pay or what do you
think there's ever been like a really
truly company who's acquired a brand and
like paying them in pennies I probably I
mean I am
and they pulled of mr. beast and just
like pay them off in nickels or
something
all right so Logitech acquire is in the
process of acquiring Blue Microphones
this is an article from the verge but
it's been pretty much everywhere on the
Internet today blue is known for their
USB condenser microphones including the
snowball the Yeti very popular
microphone brand for anyone looking for
a little boost in their audio quality
they're recording quality whether you're
a musician a screamer etc this will join
they will join Logitech's existing
portfolio brands they've already got
who's lunch tech app will they have
themselves they have Logitech G which is
their gaming series terrible terrible
attempt throwing that in the trashcan
how they have jaybird and suppose the
other I don't know any of Mastro gaming
after gaming is what Logitech owns Astro
yes which I did not know until today I
think it now we know about jaybird the
company says the acquisition is a
logical adjacent opportunity with great
synergies I think every acquisition
press released in the past 10 years has
used the word synergies and dislike
whichever PR rep broke bad wine oh fuck
you and your synergy bullshit god shit
that that word should only be system yes
and just like a synergy we touched tips
and synergy in perfect synergetic 'el
harmonious senator senator senator
genital sinner genital is it
our sinner genitals were synergetic
lease in synched with each other's
synergies alright anyway sexy um there's
not much else to say here other than
congrats logitech I guess make us some
cool microphone this is mean we're gonna
see like a blue quality microphone like
a Yeti implemented into a keyboard like
where you just have like a microphone
built into your into
mechanical keyboard or something like
that maybe there will be some I'm trying
to think as I was reading this article
as trying to think would there be any
weird sort of mashup product that would
come from what that's a peripheral maker
and specifically a keyboard mic webcam
right all-in-one which would be really
cool actually because if you ever went
to a LAN and you wanted to stream at the
land you could just bring your keyboard
be one peripheral to rule them all that
could be revolutionary that could be
really cool I don't know how it work or
look but I think there there's there's
potential here so my excitement so okay
as long as the webcam part of it is
detachable so you can reposition it cuz
my only thoughts if the webcam is
chilton the keyboard just j like in
those Jimin nostrils it looked like when
you open up your camera and it's the
front-facing can that pops on you're
just like oh come on turn a looping
around Jesus Christ I look like a
monster
you trim my nose hairs yeah so but but
be aware Bram yeah that'd be fun with
what people were bringing up a very good
point in chat and I thought about this
as well but if you had the the mic built
into your keyboard to be very loud as
your clacking away even on like you know
some quieter switches I would imagine
that's but if there was somehow have
belts and why they acquired blue though
cuz blue is the my lease acknowledge oh
he's canceling technologies to get rid
of clothes yeah they've got them they
have the technical knowledge or skill
manufacturing
could you imagine though orals or if
Logitech came out with a headset that
had a microphone and on keyboard on par
with a Yeti could you imagine a headset
a gaming headset from Logitech with like
a Yeti grade mic that would be sweet I
think that's that's maybe the more
directly I'm gonna say a headset with
the keyboard ooh be right back I'm gonna
go take a pee-pee the tape I needed my
own Bank
that's what I'm looking forward to just
watch a hole oh god I hate it when
people clip stuff because it means we've
done something terrible or embarrassing
I'll watch it later thank you everyone
let's next next up is nvidia announcing
the GeForce gaming celebration at
Gamescom 2018 sounds jubilant this
article's from Nvidia themselves
straight from the horse's mouth
Nvidia they're talking about basically
announcing their their their big ol
gaming celebration which is a day before
takes place a day before games come on
August 20th in Cologne Germany in case
you guys aren't aware games come is the
biggest or the largest gaming convention
in the world that happens annually and a
day before it starts this year Nvidia is
gonna host a little shindig and they've
invited everyone and said come on down
it's gonna be fun and I quote the event
will be loaded with new exclusive
hands-on demos that's not in the quote
of the hardest
no.not artist hottest upcoming games
stage presentations and the world's
biggest game developers and some
spectacular surprises what are the
surprises we don't know we'll find out
at the something at some point how not
extraordinary yes absolutely Pichler and
we'll find out what they're exactly
talking about with their spectacular
surprises come August 20th so yeah it
should be fun
Paul and I we will be there I will
probably be there to explore all the
games and games come and just hang out I
think I'll go to games Conn to cap yeah
you know it's it's like life shorte if
you have the opportunity to go to games
common idea and you're not on invidious
parole lists or you know you don't have
a restraining order or something or they
don't have a restraining order on you I
don't even know why this is relevant but
you should go you should go to games
come anyone who who doesn't who's not
ever been in a court battle with videos
could've games come all right my NBA
you're showing that's that sounds like I
don't know about sucking about right now
I don't know what what they're talking
about
you're talking about that it's it's in
Cologne Germany it's in Cologne Germany
not the Cologne cologne III am Adi I am
of German heritage me not although I
have never actually visited the
motherland so I you know drank all the
German because technically more German
than me but I'm looking forward to it so
if you're gonna be in Cologne for games
come then maybe we'll all have a chance
to say hi yeah we're not sure about many
of the details at this point but yeah
you know it's up in the air very
exciting very exciting yeah I'm sure
those spectacular surprises you'll be
surprising no European Union see how
things are going over there across the
pond
hey euro do you call them Europeans hey
Europeans by Germans where we're gonna
be hey German and what if you're in
Cologne would you callate Cologne in
colognian hey colognian cool I was just
I always assume it's gonna smell really
good in Cologne just gonna get there
walk out the planet I just played what a
pleasant smell it's almost as if the air
is perfumed beauty section of a shopping
mall okay so thanks Nvidia for the
announcement that you'll be doing fun
stuff Gamescom oh we can't wait to see
what you guys pull out pull out of your
hats next up we've got an article from
video cards calm once again from Nvidia
this is a bit more technical and the the
company has introduced their adaptive
temporal anti-aliasing with ray tracing
now so this is basically building upon
adaptive temporal aliasing which already
exists but now we have it with ray
tracing so it's gone from taa to a taa
and I keep thinking of like 80 18
Walker's from Star Wars but that's
totally not what we're talking about
this is all the the featured the
technology that we're talking about
allows the processing to happen in real
time with the help of ray tracing it's
designed specifically for games
which I like this isn't like games get
the back burner purpose of this
technology it's it's buy-in for gaming
developers this is a new technology
that's developed to overcome the
problems that were associated with taa
such as ghosting and blurring this was
especially prevalent in scenes that that
included a lot of motion or movement a
problem with taa so the ray-tracing
really helps to alleviate a lot of those
artifacts like ghosting and blurring
Nvidia is promising that a taa will
achieve a quality of 8x super sampling
while staying under thirty three
millisecond frame delays which is
fantastic so you're getting basically
SSA a 8x but with a reduced penalty to
performance that is a good thing and
this is measured this has been measured
in Unreal Engine 4 using a Titan beat
the tech is not coming to gamers anytime
soon according to the article which you
might expect because there are no video
cards on the market right now that would
even support this technology perhaps
perhaps there will be some new GPU in
the near future that will support this
new technology I mean it's just a matter
of time right we just don't know exactly
when that time will be the the the
authors of the research paper that that
introduces this new technology we're
emphasizing the importance of DX our API
or Microsoft DirectX ray-tracing again
which is something that needs to be
implemented by the GP manufacturer into
the cards to support the technology in
the first place
so this is a cool technology that is not
coming to gamers on any existing GPU
architecture this is next-gen this is a
next-gen feature that we could see
hopefully sooner than later I think
we're all hoping for new video cards
very soon but that's all we're gonna say
on that
very much video cards for that article
we can move on to ARS Technica's article
on on YouTube
hey we're streaming to youtube right now
might as well talk about it that's and
what's remarkable coincidence and what's
going on with YouTube right now is that
vertical video is is forever changed
along with four by three video there's
basically been a new update to the
favored to our beloved video website
that basically changes how we view
vertical video this is an example
actually I provided some links in the
image in the show doc if Paul wants to
bring those up yes let's take a look at
the four by three video so this is what
four by three video looks like on
YouTube wait expand though you can't
expand the window much anymore Kenya
okay that's interesting it looks like
this is the the tradition the old way
I'm sorry okay that's weird
because according to the article and
from what I was looking at earlier
articles wrong no did they buy it so
they do they go back on it it's supposed
to fill up the entire screen now or fill
up the entire video playing area over so
actually the picture is the before and
after pictures show it pretty clearly
that's really weird that your system or
for whatever reason it's not updated
basically because it's not updated
basically it's because I'm using the
legacy YouTube view
okay so I'll just I'll just continue
while Paul figures that about four by
three video on YouTube has always been
played back with the black bars on
either side but now the four by three
video is actually stretched out to fill
that entire video player space so
there's no more black bars and you get
essentially more video this is just a
random dudes video that I found that I
thought was hilarious it has 1.2 million
views because this is also the old view
this is also the old view so this is
what it looks like before here's the new
view so the new view old view old view
new view new view has no more black bars
instead it is just like white space
instead of black bars this is
revolutionary a massive chain it's
either revolutionary or arguably racist
and we've gone switched over to white
bars what why do they gotta be white why
does everything have to be white what I
don't know what's the difference between
these two so they're also showing that
16 by 9 video has been slightly enlarged
if you look at the left margins the
margins have been reduced so that we're
now filling up a little bit more of the
screen space with with even 16 by 9
video ok but the main changes here are 4
by 3 which no longer has black bars on
the side and I think that's the biggest
one is that 4 by 3 is now sort of a
full-screen image with no black bars the
vertical video doesn't really make sense
to me because you're literally just
switching from black bars to white bars
it doesn't seem to make a hell of a
difference to me because I don't see
color ladies and gentlemen but for
whatever reason people are still angry
about this if you look at the YouTube
help forum people are putting this new
change on blast of course what would you
change actions if your internet is is is
hesitant and and are holding up
pitchforks to change impossible people
are pissed if you look on the Google
forums and stuff people like the old way
you guys sound often chat let's have a
discussion going on what you think of
the new playback style
additionally YouTube has also rolled out
arc mode for Android YouTube's app which
is a long time coming this is already
existed on iOS and on the desktop site
finally us Android users get a dark mode
option where we can view YouTube
essentially with a dark background a
black background instead of the white
which is definitely helpful when you're
like browsing at nighttime and you don't
like your phone backlight just blaring
in here and your eyeballs and stuff it's
alive this is why yeah you're lying -
I'm not lying not lying you're in legacy
mode or some shit you you're an old man
mode you're like in irrelevant mode
because maybe it's okay if you're just
watching YouTube but if you're using
YouTube and uploading to YouTube and
there's vital things that you use and
ways that you access those things and
suddenly they're changed or moved or
moved and you have time to deal with
this shit right now because you're
trying to get a video uploaded so you
can post your stick a video before it
gets too late in the day and they have
to post it tomorrow it's what's been
moved there things things have moved
everywhere so just like screw this shit
I don't want to channel I don't see
you're trying to find it give me the old
mode right now cuz you're changed stuff
and an inconvenient time for me and I
just want the old things so I can get
stuff done the way I'm abusive being
done
alright jeez Paul it just was bullshit
this whole thing's bullshit
gosh I didn't I didn't realize that this
was such an issue through sucks
maybe maybe YouTube should you know ask
us first if we'd be ok with this this
level of change before they just go all
Apocalypto on us yeah that's just seems
rude at this point lord knows I can only
I personally I I can only upload videos
to YouTube when it's in dark mode and
even tried dark mode ok say if it's in
light mode agent legacy mode said I have
access to that
Oh old bastard alright welcome what can
you do
alright let's see it's moving on and
this is our last article for my half
this is from also from ARS technica very
fascinating article that's headlines
don't try to rejuvenate your vagina FDA
warns after scolding companies I just
couldn't let this article pass me by the
FDA is noting that Scott has given a
healthy dose of satire this is a vagina
has clearly not been rejuvenated and he
is waiting for a healthy treatment is he
looking at someone who is trying to
rejuvenate their vagina is that what
he's looking at even disapprovingly
perhaps he's you know from from the FDA
I just feel like there's a lot of
subtext going on to this picture and I'm
not 100% sure what all it is well it's
full let's dive right in and go deep
into this article no pun intended
the FDA sent warning letters to seven
companies advertising energy based
devices that are being used outside of
their approved intended uses some of
these devices are radiofrequency or
laser based and have legitimate uses
like removing warts or precancerous
vaginal vaginal or vaginal I think
vaginal is just the proper way to say it
I'm just gonna say vagina from now on
because I think that makes the most that
the most Awkward sense or cervical
tissue but these companies are instead
using them for vaginal rejuvenation and
I put that in quotes because this is
actually a phrase or a term that these
companies are marketing they're saying
come to us for your vaginal rejuvenation
and we'll promise you a tighter tissue
relieved pain and boosted sexual
pleasure basically we'll all good things
will make your pussy to live forever
that's what they're saying but they're
rejuvenating your your vaginal status to
to single I don't know what's happening
here but more specifically these
companies are collectively claiming that
the devices are able to treat vaginal
laxity pain during urination or
intercourse decreased sexual sensation
vaginal dryness itching or atrophy some
of these issues are symptoms related to
menopause urinary in consist in content
since you can in in contingents any
continence usually when I refer to
incontinence it's when I'm in at
different continents incontinence ship
but it's okay or sexual function issues
so essentially there are companies now
this is a trend this is a trend where
there are now companies saying hey you
know what we could really like you know
in order to make a product first before
you can make a product you first need a
problem and then you need to sell the
solution to that problem well you know
what my wife complains about her vagina
all the time
oh yeah mine too you know my wife says
her vagina is not what it used to be
when she was 21 that's why she goes to
forever 21 all the time in shops there
so hey why don't we why don't we create
a business called vaginal rejuvenation
where old older women can have their vag
and their vaginas recreated in a sense
given new life give birth to the thing
that usually gives birth so let's let's
let's use these tools these medical
tools medicinal tools that are generally
used to treat warts and precancerous
objects on the body but we'll use them
for our new marketing ploy called
vaginal rejuvenation and apparently the
FDA has caught on to this whole scheme
and gone this is not right people are
blasting vaginas with lasers and it's
dangerous
these lasers aren't even intended for
vaginal blasting and rejuvenating please
someone stop this so that's why the FDA
sent out letters to these companies and
we're like dude you guys got to stop
blasting people's vaginas with quick
peace put these cancer lasers it's just
it's fucked up it's really fucked up
vaginas are suffering all over the world
like my wife's a client and her vagina
is even worse than it was before I don't
know what's going on here frickin laser
beams okay so the FDA just cares about
your wife's vagina is
and then we've broken Paul Paul dot exe
has officially stopped working and here
we are at level level nine level who had
been fucked up so I don't know I don't
know what I'm going on about right now
you know word you know the FDA
Commissioner even tweeted we're deeply
concerned we're deeply concerned women
are being harmed by these procedures
he's basically saying we're deeply
concerned about women's vaginas you know
which is a an important thing to care
about I can't see it's an important
thing it's just you know it's a good
thing my image isn't being streamed this
is why we have so my half done I'm done
I'll spare you the rest of the car oh my
god oh boy okay
Lucent so far okay there's a blasting as
a jazz with the cancer later there's a
serious cockpit ball very could come I
was gonna make a very good comment two
vaginas are at risk done now okay okay
I'm sure it'll ah sorry that's a good
laugh that's a good laugh I'm sure
that'll be best for all of history to
ever to see good to have a good laugh
indeed
you know like incapacitating laugh Sam
all right so what's next Kyle what's so
next we can talk about some some
donations thank you guys very much for
donating you never have to on this show
but it's always appreciated and thank
you for sending in these messages
attached to all the money that we will
most definitely be spending on ourselves
soon bazinga X $10 Paul don't you think
Kyle Lohse you 20 push-ups for having
his computer on a carpeted floor another
20 push-ups from both of you for being
late
why
the middle of summer it's hot I don't
wanna do push-ups and I should be saying
that I owe you 20 push-ups since since
the I think he started out the elite
bailed me out floor button floor there's
a thing the elite build is so massive
that the intake is like like literally a
foot or two off the floor and the book
as the bottom fans are all exhaust the
intake at the front is first of all in
taking from the sides of the system so
it's not even getting air from the
bottom in any possible way I was running
that thing for a good two three months
straight and there was hardly any dust
and a 24/7 operation so I think it's a
little bit different with a $12,000 PC
inside of an end to elite chassis then
your typical you know I don't know each
H you know s340 elite or whatever that's
you know it's literally very nice to
have some sort of something just to
raise it you know there's sad it's sad
when it's on the floor and you know you
know the envy elites how its structured
right there's like a full sheet of metal
at the bottom and then it's really
practical you know airflow configuration
with exhaust at the bottom solves the
main issue of short of sucking a bunch
of dust and I'm just saying be nice to
you know if I you know if I owned a desk
that I thought I felt confident enough
to put that 200-pound thing on that I
probably would that was also big enough
to house it now like I want a desk it's
I'm not saying like there's like a
pallet does that mean that system would
need a frickin mini pallet - nothing
else I would trust putting it on but I
thought that hurt
in this hard ball as hard as ptg tubing
okay
notch it thank you very much $5 love the
show Paul when streaming from your house
twitch won't chromecast from twitch by
the way my screen name is because I
don't have a prominent chin
his name's Manoj chin that makes sense
it's very very much streaming from your
house switch won't chromecast from
twitch I don't understand what you're
asking you mean from my house like when
we're doing the stream our live stream
on awesome hardware I think in streaming
from your house is in you're speaking
from a personal perspective like if
you're streaming from your house blah
blah I think maybe he means when he's
watching the stream from when my studio
it's fine but when he streaming when
were streaming from your house twitch
well he can't use chromecast to throw
the stream on to his TV for I think
that's how I would interpret it but I
don't know that I don't this is very
peculiar we use we use the same software
and as far as I know pretty much the
same settings from both locations I
don't I don't know why that would be the
case right yeah that is peculiar I want
to be able to watch them later all right
thank you very much noche and hope you
figure that out Ajay Patel 4.99 you guys
are awesome quick questions since we're
talking about GPUs EVGA hybrid for the
win or orest water for extreme should I
do a vertical GPU build what is the
forest water force extreme and why have
I not really it's there 1080 anna has
looked
okay so it's as it is an AI oh it is in
the IO okay so it's basically a direct
competitor to the EVGA well geez man I
don't think you could go wrong either
way even though I haven't really fully
reviewed either one look at the reviews
they're probably pretty good either way
and should you do a vertical GPU build
this is where I would say vertical GPU
build go for it because you have it on
the cooler on your GPU that means you
can flip that you can put the radiator
and fan anywhere else in here in your
system to get healthy adequate air flow
and your temperatures will not be
impeded it does not really matter so go
for it that's actually a great
application for any io GPU as far as
which one to go for that's gonna be a
personal preference El Jefe reviews $5
Cal Congrats on getting that gold play
button do thank you very much yeah super
proud of you thanks man
much love from El Jefe thank you thank

a disappointment beer would be it when
beer is so not disappointing great but
it's not - you moron really maybe it's
like you're disappointed then and then
you have the beer and maybe that helps a
little bit but we shouldn't really rely
on beards like cure disappointment I
feel like that's you know you know me
too
and healthy level of dependence but but
Thank You Carol for your donation we
call that one alcoholism it's all right
Zach's TV $5.00 can you recommend a
platform to me for gaming streaming and
editing PC in the micro ATX form factor
thanks for the time love the show a
platform and 4450 yeah ed be 450 am for
I would say for gaming streaming and
editing sure in a micro ATX form factor
there's there's bound to be some there's
definitely some micro ATX be 450 boards
if you're looking right so a reasonable
amount of money then you probably want
to rise in a rise in second gen and AM
for word there are micro ATX form factor
motherboards for like X $2.99 an X on
Intel side and X 399 an AMD side for
high-end desktop stuff but you'll spend
a lot more money on those so yeah
probably the a.m. for option that's your
best that's better yeah I can't go wrong
there NB 67 13 dollars and 37 cents as
always a mile I like the concept of you
can you pimp my PC par pick or list
Cheers Thanks it's gonna be here some
good some solid feedback from that one
yeah we will definitely be bringing it
back bazinga
X $5 Germany is fatherland not mother
Wow
that's another 20 push-ups for you I'm
sorry haha I like how you're eating all
of the push-ups I'm supposed to only
make me stronger but yeah I didn't I
I'm bad I'm a bad German you pet your
German
person who just race to the fatherland
can count cotton contagious pages it
spelled very interestingly five dollars
if upgrading from horizon 1600 I want
the 2700 X would love to SLI in the
future with 10 80s which motherboard
would you recommend do I do streaming
and heavy gaming well for SLI you'll
definitely want an X 370 or X 470
motherboard yeah and I feel like as long
as you spend 150 bucks or more you're
mostly good there's yeah a little
critiques you can make between each
board and that kind of thing but most of
those that are that expensive have
decent power delivery
I like Asus boards and I like Asus does
a good job
ACS gigabyte asrock MSI it's basically
any of the motherboards that are out
there not any those are the big four
there are similar there are some lesser
or manufacturers that I don't always
trust as much they're still fine in some
cases but you know again like Paul said
you can't go wrong with a lot of those
big brands just go with personal
preference and stuff if you plan to be
gaming and streaming for long periods of
time I would focus unlike the actual
heat dissipation over the motherboard
make sure it's got like good heat sinks
maybe even either active cooling or just
something that can be cooled relatively
well yeah I hope that helps and I see
donations coming in a mile a minute so
sell if you could cough the donations
every bottle or shelf the ones coming
from now on to paul's half and we'll get
around to that
go ahead and make a note in the show doc
thank you very much elite gamers $5 love
your channel computers and badge lasers
that's what we're here you know talking
about the important stuff merging and
these discuss all of the best things

and Russia wire five Canadians gonna get
the name of the drugs you guys are doing
because you're what the eff
let's see I don't think we're I am high
on black you crazy and true what are you
bold allegation to make of your favorite
youtuber
we are just awesome people who I'm in a
good to have a good time having a good
mood because first there was like a lot
of tension leading up to the show
because I was like I was like oh no what
if I'm not ready and I need to make sure
I'm ready and then I kind of like got
ready and we're a little bit late but it
still got ready like everything kind of
and like once all that kind of fits
together and then you start the show
after that point that's like well we're
live and if anything goes wrong we're
just live and we got to roll with it
anyway so at that point I feel like
there's sort of a there's a release of
tension and you just sort of relax a
little bit and let yourself go and that
drinking's
some some drinks helps as well so that's
what we're on Andrew if you want to know
the drug run it's called Hakuna Matata
it means no worries that's mescaline aka
mescaline peyote mash up enough of that
though we should get some mescaline
after the show yeah glitched vibes five
Canadians life bit wit good now that I
have your five Canadians me even better
I'm five Canadians richer five Canadian
dollars more powerful whoo thanks
glitched droom it been five dollars love
your vids quick question what audio
interface do you guys use preamps sound
solid and recent favorite bands and
music at recent favorite bands I'm still
sticking with Tycho cuz they're the most
like recent band that I've discovered
that I really enjoy listening to
introducing psycho Callie I was from Cal
they are amazing your face alright so I
don't know if you're talking about right
now the audio solution that we're using
I have a video on it
it's the yamaha mg 10x you is the ax or
a board that i have here which has some
very power and some XLR inputs and some
other cool stuff compressor like you can
do a whole
while he's doing that some funny things
I've been listening to Odessa and
grammatic I've done chromatic forever
but I've been listening to more him more
because there's a music festival in
Vegas coming up in September I'm going
to called life is beautiful and both
Edessa and Grammatik will be there so
I've been listening to the shit out of
them so I can arrange my face off - even
life oh yeah Kyle oh yeah do you have
anything else to add to that Kyle you
want me to be it's already doing that
that's already doing that for you you
don't have to do that but then what does
it sound when I do I just I don't know
what that sounds like
really someone twitch clip that it might
be clipping well not that kind of clip
but okay anyway so that's one of the
things that our soundboard can do yeah
we just blow everyone's ears off I don't
know that was pitch change so I think we
sounded like Satan but I'm not sure
awesome
mission complete Daniel Shults $5 hey
guys and watch all the time keep up the
good work what's your opinion on buying
X mining GPUs it didn't even work
nothing happens wait do I say don't stop
stop okay how about now do I sound like
the devil now how's that is it working
now cuz the lights on and I think that
might mean that it's actually working
this time I'm the devil but come on dick
we should use these effects more often I
think okay still not working why that
nope nope didn't pick it's it worked we
what
I don't know oh my god I like reading
like not working okay I don't know why
it's not working us but it should be
working
okay okay again what's your opinion on
buying ex mining GPUs let's focus I
wasn't working you should buy them with
caution unless they're super dirt cheap
and you're using them as a a temporary
solution because you have no idea what
those GPUs have been for other than that
oh sorry
there's knobs on our individual channels
too
okay sorry go on he was asking if he
should buy ex mining GPUs I was saying
it's kind of a risk because you have no
idea what those GPUs have been through
how long they've been running 24/7 if
you can find an extremely good deal on
them that you just you just like okay if
it you you have to ask yourself the
personal question this is a personal
thing if you're buying an RX 580 for a
hundred and fifty dollars you're like
and you're thinking you have to decide
for yourself if this thing's gonna crap
out on me in like six months to a year
or two years am I gonna be okay with
that
so assess how long you think that GPU
will last you under a heavy mining load
always assume the worst case scenario is
what I would suggest and then decide is
the price up there asking worth the
worst-case scenario of that GPU that's
the best I could really offer you all
right do I say am I did I say that all
is the devil no no no no okay good you
know Eboli talk about yeah mining for
GPUs I mean I've heard that there's a
bunch like mining GPUs are there a bunch
of them going up for sale right now
working working it might be it might it
might be actually a good time
potentially potentially it's a good time
to buy a used mining GPU that you can
get a really good deal just do two
really
- I mean Hank if I could find like an RX
480 or rx 580 for 150 bucks right now I
would bite the shit out of that car that
sounds reasonable
I think it's working now okay call aka
Little Nicky that's just
you sound like three girls that's Jesus
I just just try to prove to myself that
it could work
yeah no you did you definitely did but
thank you boys like thank you to the
person in chat who pointed out there are
FX knobs on the individual channels we
must have like the exact same a sport or
something I love Jack popular chat board
you know the thing is about chat like
they'll always know more than us cuz
it's like hundreds of minds versus Alice
yeah you are a real bargain
chat you are our real overlords you're
the real MVP
