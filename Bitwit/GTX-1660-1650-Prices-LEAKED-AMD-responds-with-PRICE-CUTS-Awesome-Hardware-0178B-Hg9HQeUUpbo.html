and I can keep them on wood because I
made it through the holidays and CES and
everything I have a policy where I don't
cover my mouth and I sneeze it's against
my religion so you can't hate me for it
sounds horrible not for you yeah hey
Mark
hey wait who wasn't expecting a specific
name to follow that and exclamation have
your sponsor mark I'm switched it
because he's pointing out that this
focus looks a little soft
oh we're using a webcam it's literally a
webcam I'll let Kyle do the intro though
hey Kyle
okay are we screaming - both man
screaming welcome back to awesome
hardware this is side B if you missed
the first half and you'd like to check
that out you can go to youtube.com slash
Paul's hardware or follow the link in my
description below but this is a tech
news show that we do every single
Tuesday if I'm 30 M Pacific time here on
Twitch on TV / awesome hardware and our
respective YouTube channels as I've
already pointed out we'd like to have a
couple drinks and occasionally we square
so if you have little ones around or
sensitive earring a few years but beware
then beware beware then beware I was
trying to combine like two or three
different words at the same time and you
can buy stuff from our stores my store
is biblioth√®que and I have a bunch of
merchandise they're very high quality
that you can check out it helps support
the channel it pays for for the amazing
set that I have before you oh yeah and
and I will I will Johnson the shit out
of you at the end of the show if you
happen to purchase something from my
store Paul store is Paul's hardware net
you will also get a loud and proud
Johnson from em should you purchase any
one of his high-quality materials or
items are all very very lovely
additionally shout out to so many other
people in chats who are muttering in the
stream I think wife and sauce might be
in there as well
show to you guys thanks for being here
and thank you everyone who's doing the
superjet donations on youtube we will be
reading out your comments attached to
those donations by the end of the show
in the
party perhaps this is also the first
time we have livestream the show from
Kyle's new house good point yes this is
a totally new and I literally just
poured it over all the equipment and
hardware in them the computer and stuff
that I was using at the old office they
came in I mean you burned all the old
equipment we're starting from scratch
okay so why were used as a webcam that's
a better explanation and definitely
gives us a bigger excuse as to why the
quality is pretty crappy right now
so hopefully the next time we're
streaming from here from my place in
about two weeks things will look a bit
more put together and will actually have
a decent quality for you guys so thanks
for bearing with us hey if this quality
is passable you can see it's totally
dangerous yeah
and the things we're gonna say they're
very important that's it's really the
content you know I've just assumed that
that's the case for your half cow based
on past precedent yeah thanks for thanks
for stacking that pressure on me you got
notes and important gtx 1660 i mean
that's a yeah that's a big headliner
it's a good thing of course what are we
talking about that okay all right so
this articles from WC CF tech about the
GTX so we actually ended your half of
the stream with news on the 16 60 TI or
at least price checking it yeah which
seems to be all in order but now we have
some work we've cut wind of a GTX 1660
non ti as well as a gtx 1650 both prices
and launch dates have been leaked this
is an article from WCC of tech via the a
report from digi times
so thanks digit times in WCC of tech
these are of course going to be these
cards are gonna have the Turing GPU
architecture without the archaic
features very much like their older
brother or their bigger brother the 16
60 TI what we're seeing right here just
cutting right to the chase two hundred
and twenty nine dollars for the gtx 1660
which will launch march fifteenth again
all rumors all speculation grain of salt
but 229 dollars for the gtx 1660 come
March 15th which is right around the
corner following hot on the heels of its
older brother now they're those going to
feature a these cards are going to
feature a cut-down version of the TU 116
GPU so you're gonna have fewer cord
the food of course Gouda Gouda course
you're gonna have puta food of course if
you were good of course food of course
food of course
twelve hundred twelve hundred and eighty
food of course and six gigs of VRAM
which is still not too shabby for the
1660 this will probably be we're
speculating here faster than a gtx 1060
when you consider that the 1660 t i was
quite a bit faster on most games than a
gtx 1070 so hopefully we'll see this
these this card scale in a similar
fashion with its predecessor essentially
the pricing here as well for two hundred
and twenty-nine for this card also
competes directly with an RX v AV i did
a price check earlier today you can you
can get an RX 580 for around two hundred
and twenty nine give or take ten twenty
bucks even even the RX 590 in some cases
can be had for as low as two hundred and
twenty or thirty bucks if you look if
you know where to look so it'll be
interesting to see if you know well more
news on AMD and how they're responding
to perhaps this announcement in just a
moment now if you're talking about the
gtx 1650 that's gonna be coming in at a
price of one hundred and seventy nine
dollars US and arriving April thirtieth
so just a month or so after the gtx 1660
this is obviously gonna have a different
core than the sixteen sixty with
somewhere between eight hundred and
ninety six to a thousand and twenty four
cuda cores and four gigs of the ram
however it will be speculatively gddr5
memory as opposed to GD v r6 with the
rest of the Turing GPUs the pricing on
this card competes directly with the rx
570 I would say sort of you know towards
the high end there so it'll be
interesting to see just where the
performance lies now that actually
segues us perfectly into the next
segment perfect is from also from WCC F
Tech and this is via tweet by bits and
chips more rumors here but this is
basically confirm you're not confirming
this is speculating that AMD is
responding to all of invidious news that
I just presented by doing price cuts on
the RX 580 and the rx 590 so mainstream
Polaris GPUs it makes sense it only
makes sense we've seen this multiple
times we've seen both AMD and NVIDIA do
this in the past especially when you
consider the GTX 1660 Ti already having
the benchmarks gone public beating out
pretty much a rx 590 and it's actually
closer in performance to an RX Vega 56
really or gtx 1070 it's kind of in a
different league than the competing
product that it's that it's priced
similarly to so it would make logical
sense for AMD to say well no one's gonna
buy our car to that price there's
definitely a better option at that price
from our competitors let's lower that
down and the speculative price trimmer
price for the RX 590 is 229 dollars so
if you line that up with the gtx 1660
actually that we just talked about that
is still a rumored card it's gonna be
launching for the same price 1669 TI and
the RX 590 will perhaps be around the
same price at 229 kind of interesting
the RX 580 yep I was gonna say like I
feel like people have been frustrated in
the past year or two because when it
comes to competition and the GPU space
in particular like what you're used to
seeing happen is the next generation of
products comes around that offers a
performance boost you know 10 to 20
percent usually sometimes more and
usually those cards will come in and
kinda replace what's currently available
at roughly the same prices you know
sometimes they'll they'll creep it up a
little bit right but after last year
with the 20 series the Nvidia launch
like they just didn't do that at all
they're like alright we're bringing in
the new stuff but we're just gonna put
it on top yeah what are
exists in church right you know upwards
my phone
oh I words of $1,000 per GPU this
by contrast seems to be more of the kind
of traditional traditional strategy good
news for consumers type of thing and
read graphics card has come out you now
have a card that used to cost two
hundred sixty dollars dropping that to
two twenty two thirty two twenty nine
yeah yeah savings for the consumer more
performance for a lower price which I
think makes sense which I think makes
sense for the segment's that you're
looking at like the products seem to be
more consumer friendly on the
entry-level to mid range side and they
seem to be just more there's there seems
to be more fuckery on the high-end side
yes I think maybe because manufacturers
like Nvidia know that people who have
money are willing to spend more money
and are more willing to bend over and
take it in the ass because they can
whereas people who are on a fixed budget
hey you could charge whatever you want
for that high end GPU I ain't buying it
because my wallet is saying no so that
it seems to be more forgivable and a
little bit more sensible really the
lower you go on the totem pole in terms
of GPU tears just based on how you know
buyers are are outfitted their bank
thank you for the EPS inch at my phone
survived oh my god anytime I can
testament to the case alright so um yeah
bear in mind of the arcs the also the
580 praise job yeah I was gonna say the
RX 5 any price drop is gonna be $1.99 to
be every word so that also somewhat
competes is $20 more than the GTX 1650
so it'll be interesting to see how those
stack up performance wise the urban
price of the GTX 1650 right correct
narcs 580 I think has gone for $1.99
before during like
yeah Friday time cream leaders official
official schools they're just dropping
them all to that place that would be
nice all right moving on we've got an
article from overclock pre-need net
about Microsoft perhaps bringing Xbox
one game compatibility to the Windows
platform this is a good news for us if
it turns out to be true for us PC gamers
like an emulator it's kind of like an
emulator but this basically stems from a
lot of Windows 10 insiders having gained
access to a game called state of decay
which appeared to come from Xbox servers
rather than the Windows 10 store which
was the first clue the second clue that
was really a big hitter here was that it
was using the dot xvc format which is
designed specifically for Xbox one but
this you know you know that this
seemingly exclusive Xbox one format can
now be installed by Windows is what do
all these windows 10 insiders are
finding so it seems to be like it seems
like Microsoft might be opening the door
for some form of console emulation on PC
to quote the article here it could just
be a way for Microsoft to make porting
Xbox one games over to PC easier or vice
versa which would be the less exciting
option but it could also hopefully be an
indication of early plans to give PC
users the ability to play the entire
Xbox one game library which would be
sweet I I think the more that platforms
can mesh together and the fewer
exclusive titles we have the better it
is for for gamers and the community and
stuff that's exciting because that means
games like Halo Master Chief collection
Red Dead Redemption - which I bought an
Xbox one specifically for those can
potentially one day be played natively
on PC can you play through that I have
not which angers me
but it was just a terrible time to buy a
console just for a single game being in
the midst of the move a big move with
with your business and your life and
your personal belongings it's I haven't
had much time I've actually played more
Resident Evil 2 than I have read to ever
intention to I think it's because
already they almost have similar
acronyms Resident Evil 2 is on PC I'm
just on the PC all the time so my
goodness just it's just a mouse-click
away
just very much we're just like Oh gonna
fire up the Xbox I got to walk all the
way over the TV I'm such a lazy PC user
anyway who knows who knows also what
kind of limitations this will pose let's
say that Microsoft is planning full
support for PC with their Xbox one games
there might be limitations you might
have a frame rate cap all the other
things that we've seen from the Windows
10 store the Windows Store I should say
that would suck that would really really
suck and be a huge anti climactic point
budged and I mean there's there's
there's two sides to the coin right like
if you're talking about an Xbox one
emulator then you might be taking
basically the same quality game that's
on Xbox and porting it to the PC so
positive there is that there's games
that might be available on the PC that
weren't before okay there's also another
positive that I was thinking about right
now which is like take a game like Grand
Theft Auto 6 which they're working on
yeah like you can be pretty sure I
assured of sure if you look at GTA 5 and
the disparity between the launch of it
on the consoles oh yeah and I'm like I
think more than a year and a half before
it came out of the PC right well you
could say if you have something like
this then if it's also an Xbox one or
whatever then you should also have
access to it on the PC right other side
though because you know this type of
thing and has nuance and you have to
consider multiple aspects to it they did
so much work with GTA 5 when it came out
on the PC it was so much better in many
weighs down console versions so do you
guys want speed do you want that game to
come out quickly and have access it to
to it on the PC like immediately right
or you want to wait until a company like
Rockstar takes their time to do it the
way they want to and then suddenly have
you know all these different scales of
resolution right retail and stuff and
mods and everything that comes yeah so
and I'm sure there's also the the factor
when it comes to like money like the
platform itself like I'm sure a lot of
these publishers or game developers have
deals with like PlayStation over Sony or
with Microsoft where it's like hey you
guarantee us a certain number of you
know along the period a window where we
have exclusivity on this platform before
it launches on anything else then we cut
you a deal you know whatever money my
money so it's it there's a lot of moving
parts to it that the correct I wouldn't
see them suddenly saying like alright
any Xbox game is now available on the PC
via this yeah whatever they're doing
plan because that does take away a lot
of their ability to say like this is the
console exclusive like you have to buy
the console if you want to play this
game right you gotta buy your Xbox one
or whatever to play ready production
yeah because that's very it's very
effective it's but it's proven to be
very effective tool many times in the
past look at any like Zelda game yeah
how many a Nintendo consoles were sold
how many people that were in charge and
then Tendo console just to play a Zelda
game I guess either because of nostalgia
because the games themselves are just
really well designed or anything like
that anyway we'll see all right
so that's pretty much all for now we
have one more a news story here this is
also from hexxus
it's about micro SD Express this is sort
of a building upon what Paul was talking
about in his his half so the SD
Association or SD a announced a new
standard for their mobile devices for
mobile devices in general at their at
the Mobile World Conference event or MWC
just kind
sounds like a wrestling event but it's
not microSD Express incorporates the PCI
Express and via me interface which we're
all very well aware of and they're kind
of stick of gum nvme SSDs to the legacy
SD interface in the microSD form factor
so nvme protocol crammed into a micro SD
card now to to recap this announcement
follows last year's launch of full-sized
SD Express cards and SD you see cards
with capacities ranging anywhere from 2
terabyte to a hundred and twenty-eight
terabytes so micro SD Express delivers
as Paul had mentioned 900 up to 985
megabytes a second that's a crazy data
transfer rate that again rivals the
speeds of like double the speed of a
standard two and a half inch SATA based
SSD for example this is a it's a it's an
nvme upper layer protocol that enables
advanced memory access mechanisms a
subset of cards will be available based
on the new SD 7.1 spec including micro
SD HD Express micro SDXC Express and
micro SD you see Express the stay
hydrated but just reminded us to drink
water thank you stay hydrated bot what
stay hydrated by listen twitch you just
said we've been live for over an hour
now back drink water and at this point
in our broadcast we should have consumed
at least four ounces of florida and
maintain Wow optimum hydration so you
get like alerts for bio breaks now in
chat will it tell me they like take a
piss at some point probably it's been an
hour since you last drink water after I
reminded you to drink water you should
probably have a bowel movement I don't
know if it accounts for the fact that
we're probably drinking beer at the same
time that beers question when it comes
to hydration it's about you know
everything so so yeah they're referring
to them as removable solid state drives
if that's any any indication of how how
much confidence they have in the
performance of these micro SD cards
they're calling them SS
these painting which is somewhat valid
if they're gonna be twice the speed of a
SATA based one this opens new
opportunities for devices and will
facilitate new levels of creation like
super slo-mo video rock continuous burst
photography 8k 360 video capture just to
name a few
also can you run Windows off of one of
these and what's that gonna be like if
you run games can you can you install
your Steam library and a bunch of games
onto one of these weird flash you yeah
you should be able to run Windows off
one of these just find if those are the
read and write speeds and it would be
like running out Windows off of a nice
SSD so I'm factor wise we're talking
about the same standard when it for like
an S a micro SD card is that so yeah the
micro SD card is there anything about
backwards compatibility if you just try
to plug it into a standard SD card
reader like would you be able to
transfer it some totally you know 80 to
100 megabytes per second transfer rate
it didn't say but I would imagine you
can you'll just be bottlenecks by your
slowest your slowest connection all
right well or the slow in clinical and
also kind of case is there's gonna is
there gonna be like an external SD card
reader that needs to plug into a PCI
Express slot our name dot two slot so it
can have direct PCIe layin connectivity
I'm just I'm just curious about the
physical implementation of this hmm
the the speed sound awesome right and
when it comes to recording to or copying
data off of an SD card and that's often
one of the things like for me when I'm
shooting video or whatever like Joe and
I shot a video the other day where we
the
how to build a PC video that I just
posted earlier today and we have like
200 there 200 gigs of footage when we
were done for the day and like he wanted
to go home because we spent one day
filming a my guy let's transfer footage
and then it's like I oh we're gonna sit
here for 30 yea because that's the
fastest rate that it can copy that data
off of the SD card I have a 256 gig SD
card
yeah we're tuned to gigs of data on it
yeah that's just how long it took right
so yeah I'm excited about this and I'm
curious about implementation support on
desktops that's why the courts or other
ways there may not be one there it may
just be from Opel for now okay well if
it's PCI Express from my understanding
then as long as you can you have some
way to connect it up to PCI Express
Lanes go to the CPU then you should be
able to there might be a third party
device yeah don't look we're like a PCI
card PCIe card that's just got a micro
SD card slot on it
I'm thing like an Express card that has
some sort of cable or some or maybe even
external rear or they're like so that
wouldn't be practical like you need you
need to be able to access it to plug a
card in if you're talking about like a
card reader or something like that but
PCI Express add-on card with like a
breakout cable that comes over for
something like this externally yeah
right
I can't you did your cable management
too good you can unplug it
what's a little USB immigrant and then
you've got a card reader that sits on
your desk or something that can access
those speeds right and it just loops
back into plug into the back of your
computer uh-huh weird if micro SD
Express is the new USB type-c where all
of us tech reviewers just start
complaining as to why cases don't have
micro SD Express a friend I you know if
it's a new standard I'll complain about
it all day
so it's it's on all the cases can't wait
for the rant on that one all right
that's gonna sum up tech new generation
Eric general tech news for today we're
gonna move on to our next segment which
is hot and heavy heart
and we're actually talking about some
physical product and a fix this what
this no not X twice axed up there I
don't have have you heard real in-depth
I'm sorry oh come on that's like a go to
that's a golden segment should always be
always be on the hot button
should always be hot keyed feel the hot
key all of these different there's not
every year it's enough to medical order
Paul sorry
Isis sometimes forget what order the
alphabet isn't don't you dare try to ask
me ever again
pretty common alright so this first
article is from hot hardware
coincidentally it's about the energizer
phone energizer yes the battery company
has officially launched their P 18 K pop
which is a very interesting name for a
smart phone power break doubles as a
cumbersome phone that's yeah so it's
basically a power brick and eighteen
thousand milliamp hour power brick but
it's also a phone somehow energizer
thought this would be a great idea I
would be very cused to see how many of
these they sell because look at the
thickness and it's supposed to be
thankful and it's supposed to be like
this is the definition of thick CC thick
and I can't even imagine it's probably
heavier than it looks
if that's all battery like bricks are
not light that can probably barely fit
in a conventional pocket like a male
jeans pocket that's massive so it it
does have some some interesting specs
immediate technically Oh p70 SOC with
six gigs of RAM and 128 gigs built-in
storage with a micro SD slot a 6.2 inch
screen with the 19 by 9 aspect ratio is
the micro SD slot
compatible with one terabyte micro SD
cards it freakin better be should be for
the amount of space this thing takes up
my god
but the real the real prize the real
star the show here is the battery of
course at 18,000 milliamps it's five
times the
of the iPhone excess max more than four
times the capacity of Samsung's Galaxy S
10 plus it's got cameras on the front
and back but also supports 200 hours of
video playback although this might be a
typo I saw the article says 200 hours of
video playback or 50 hours on standby
did they mean to reverse those two
because how could you have fewer hours
on standby than you have on video
perhaps a typo in the article so maybe
they meant 50 hours of video playback
which seems more reasonable and 200
hours on standby
sounds more real right 8 to 9 hours to
fully charge 8 to 9 hours to fully
charge this thing you literally have to
charge it it sounds like a quick charge
with the 2 amp that is with fast
charging 2.4 amp perhaps a 9 hour that
means even after a night's sleep I mean
some of us only get you know 5 hours of
sleep at night that means it won't even
be fully charged by the morning if you
are draining charging from from fully
dead but at the same time you would have
probably 2 X the the battery life of any
other phone on the market even at 70%
capacity and you'd have really toned
like forearms oh yeah lifting it
energizer butter face all the time I
mean I feel like as marketing as the
years goes on the Energizer Bunny should
just be like more and more jacked you
know he's been pounding on that thing
for so long he's still got the weak
measly ass forearms it's like come on
that would that would imply that he is
like a biological being though you know
versus mechanical I say why not
batteries I say why not both some sort
of energy energizer bunny cyborg and the
hybrid
sounds like a boss from Deus Ex
and some OGG some augmented semi
man-machine man-machine bunny that'd be
scary I I would run
all right let's move up okay this next
article is from voor ten portion is
which I always want to say vortex but
it's portes I trick you at the very end
of their name this is about fractal
designs new addressable RGB fans
actually they have a dress full RGB fans
and single color LED fans but obviously
the RGB ones are more interesting
the Prisma a L and the Prisma SL for
addressable and single LED I would
imagine six LEDs per fan illuminates fan
blades and the outer ring for a more
uniform look thank you look pretty nice
the very they look very like like
fractal tends to do very like
minimalistic so that it kind of blends
with whatever you put it with you know
it's not super stylized which I always
am a fan of nailed it so yeah I think I
think I think they look good and as
Brian actually Brian from BPS customs a
good friend and a fellow youtuber he
actually had exclusive exclusivity to
these fans in North America so he was
the only youtuber in America that posted
a video on these fans on launch day yeah
it's great video he does a good job as
he usually does and say he's you know
just just leveraging his position now in
order to get the scoop on us yeah
absolutely you know it was a total
backstabber
what a dick yeah I hate him what a dick
no one's subscribed to him so yeah he's
got all the specs here and says that
would caught his eye initially about
these fans was that the fan of the tips
of the blades are very close to the
frame which increased aesthetic pressure
my god airflow 5 bucks each 25 bucks
each which shouldn't surprise you
because that's the round the price falls
right in line with other you know
high-end RGB fans these days available
in a triple pack or Saltz single single
units addressable RGB has a price most
definitely which is why it's kind of
nice that fractal has the single LED
options so that if you don't want to pay
25 bucks a pop you get it for much
cheaper
- Brian have exclusivity on the single
RGV single dad I don't know I think he
just got the address Laurie to be once
but in this shot I think he's he's
actually demonstrating the fact that
these these fans can daisy-chain
together and he's he tried seven of them
together and they all worked fine
there's no official limit there's no
official on paper limit as far as how
many date fans you can daisy-chain
stating the RGB large be there except
okay yeah yeah they're not powered in
via like the fan blades are moving but
the RGB implementation looks perfect
across seven fans which is great because
you're only so limited you're so limited
on how many addressable RGB headers you
have on a given motherboard you know
okay I had some issues with hotline two
yesterday like oh geez I have too much
RGB and knowed enough headers so it's
nice that freckles offering daisy chain
support we've all been there well been
there um let's see that's that's all I
want to say about that good job fractal
take you long enough
better late than never I suppose moving
on we've got Dan article from
overclocked 3d
once again about crucial updating their
BX 500 series SSDs with an affordable
960 gig offering this is great if you
guys are interested in a you know near
one terabyte SSD and you're on a budget
the original bx 500 series launched in
August of last year offering 480 gig
models at 89 bucks but now you'll be
able to snag almost a terabyte for just
40 bucks more which is quite a steal
this isn't like a Black Friday deal or
anything just 129 bucks for a near
terabyte the entry-level BX series as a
lot of you guys know is sort of a one
step below the MX series but still
offers 540 and 500 megabytes per second
sequential reads and writes respectively
it's using micron 96 layer 3d TLC um and
and this is of course of the two and a
half inch form factor with a seven
millimeter thickness should fit in most
laptops and of course your typical death
top environment three-year warranty hits
retailers soon oh it's nice to see
crucial coming up with new cheap ass
SSDs
I'm all for a budget builds 130 bucks
per terabyte mmm you know here's PC part
picker right now I'm looking at SSDs I'm
looking at basically 500 gig class and
one terabyte class SSDs price check so
you can get 960 gig SSDs for 100 bucks
right now hey oh okay any Davis got
their su 650 these have been coming down
like this is this is really nice
yeah actually what I want 100 but I'm
gonna increase this to to include 2
terabyte drives Kreisberg a what's the
cheapest - 10 cents a gig oh that's so
nice that's such a nice place boogie so
look at that the cheapest drive right
now when I got the price per gig is
literally a 1 terabyte team l5 light
well it's not gonna be the most insanely
fast but yeah SSD buddy fast enough for
it's a one terabyte SATA SSD 400 bucks
that's crazy soft once our cheapest 2
terabyte 2 terabytes for 240 right now
oh and that's an until 660 P what I am
and it's MDOT - yeah that's an nvme
drive that's a that's that's that's whoa
it's just gonna give you temporarily
maybe that's a sale block no that's just
it huh this doesn't even seem like it's
not a fire sale or anything love it all
right 660 P this one has read speeds of
eight hundred eighteen hundred megabyte
make it I should be a bit no my
megabytes of I'm sorry per second reads
and writes this is a good trip I mean
it's not the fastest nvme drive what's
the next most expensive what's the next
cheapest - terabyte drive just for
comparison a two terabyte we're
recapping the price anyway this is
exciting new price check segment my
clothes are about to fly dr. Dre gamers
Nexus
just looking just eating it alright for
two terabyte drives that's crazy to me
that the cheapest three terabyte drive
by Intel is an Intel nvme drive I've
never had which is gonna run circles
around any of these SATA drives maybe
they're launching a new one in there
tryna get rid of in clear inventory
I'm gonna go buy one of those again why
would it not be on sale that's so weird
but anyway so guys that's your price you
should be paying for SSDs right now 500
gig grav 50 bucks yeah one terabyte
drive hundred bucks two terabyte drive
turnovers although apparently you can't
get it for two hundred but two terabyte
nvme Drive 200 bucks and I won't
complain things are looking up for the
PC master-race
yay let's move on to our last article
for today which is the HTC 5g hub this
is an article from hexxus at MWC 2019
the event that we mentioned earlier
HTC launched a new smart home hub and
kinda looks like a Google home hub or a
Amazon echo show it's got that 5-inch
screen but it offers a 5d hotspot as a
main feature so you can bring it
anywhere that you don't naturally have a
wireless connection or Wi-Fi and do
things on the internet with it it's kind
of kind of Handy it has a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 855 SOC which is actually not
a bad chip compared to the competitors
Google Home Hub or echo show Android 9pi
full Android interface USB see video out
so you could connect this to a larger
monitor if you wanted to just kind of
handy and it has built-in batteries so
you could go wireless with this guy you
don't need to be tethered to a wall
outlet
so to speak so all these various
features open this device up to a lot
more to many more possibilities than
you'd otherwise have with your
conventional smart home hub the other
cool thing is that it's advertised to
enable smooth 4k streaming okay you can
have low latency gaming experiences
apparently and faster networks in the
home and office
super
5g network can connect up to 20 devices
simultaneously oh we just got raided by
the way by General Monica Lee
Jerry thanks man hi Jerry thanks for the
raid you - bet that's thanks for joining
us
viewers of Jerry aka Barclays we love
you yeah we love Jerry - do we just we
recently rated Jerry as well I think so
I think we did it's like Instant Karma
yeah this is the only reason I do nice
things one meet one has and comes back
into washes the other days I really like
saying that it's phrase because I think
I feel kind of creepy
one-hand way sounds like something
fucking Hannibal Lecter would say but
one hand washes the other
exactly but you can't I mean but it's
still just a normal phrase how it sounds
but somehow it sounds like like a serial
killer
thanks for the reader Jerry oh yeah
thanks for joining us any of you guys
came over from there thanks y'all Jerry
radiators on the perfect day when we
have like the worst quality and zero
background knows that running a full
webcam today
yeah Jerry fans come back next week good
it'll be a little better clothes will
improve things crispy I all right so HTC
5g hub looks pretty interesting a seven
seven thousand and six hundred and sixty
million battery that apparently lasts
all day so she said so potentially you
could be gaming on a server at a park on
your little five inch 5g hotspot hub
okay
and it has it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so
you could potentially connect bluetooth
peripherals
right keyboard and mouse I feel like I
want to do a follow-up to my tiny PC
gaming setup with this thing and see if
it's a better experience or not
depending on functionality and it's but
I need to hike to the top of Mount
Elbert again ooh highest tiniest lim-hos
tiniest land party but not just local
land party ooh we'd be lame
partying with people on the other side
of the world LAN party when party
highest tiniest Wayne party
Iceman just thought this is that we'll
get there we're still spitballing here
all right
that's all I have for my half so yeah I
was efficient good I guess we can end
the stream here but don't go anywhere
because we're doing an after party
afterwards that's why it's called after
party I was redundant so we'll be
reading off donations from super chat
will given out it will be giving out dar
or do Johnson's Johnson Johnson shout
outs and then perhaps play a little bit
of the games who knows who knows what
could happen be a fun party
