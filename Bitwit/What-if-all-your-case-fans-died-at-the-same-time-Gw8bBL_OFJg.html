channel hope you're all doing well
so the other day I was recalling a time
years ago when the built-in fan
controller on the first PC I ever built
suddenly died while I was gaming mind
you and moments later my entire system
shut down as an automatic failsafe I
thought to myself man case fans must
really have a huge impact on thermals so
much to the point that you risk all-out
system failure without them but then I
remembered that the fan on my CPU
coolers heatsink was also wired to that
same controller which suddenly explained
why my system shut down so quickly the
CPU cooler fan dot is the processor
overheats
and cuts the power as a preventative
measure so on the tail end of my brief
trip down memory lane I began wondering
what would have happened if just the
case fans would have died would the
system still overheat throttle a little
bit maybe what I even notice anything
was wrong that's basically what we're
here to find out today what would happen
if all your case fans died at the same
time
to recreate that harrowing moment I've
assembled a fairly average high-end
gaming PC specs include the core i7 6900
k Broadwell processor which lives on
intel's most relevant high-end desktop
platform currently I've overclocked the
eight core chip to 4.3 gigahertz at one
point three eight volts and it's being
thermally assisted by a cooler master
hyper 212 Evo our asus strix x99 gaming
motherboard is kitted with a 16 gigabyte
quad channel kit of Corsair Vengeance
lpx ddr4 at 3200 megahertz
with as otech amp Edition gtx 1070
running at its factory overclock speed
will be booting off of a 1 terabyte
crucial MX 200 SSD and frightful design
has provided the Newton 600 watt power
supply and their ever so popular define
s mid tower chassis I also made the
incestuous decision to swap the cases
stock fans with Corsairs 140 millimeter
maglevs which fall within the top tier
of current ablated offerings let the
records show this is nothing against
fractals GP 14s but I insisted on having
three identical fans and the defined s
only comes with two so the GP 14 can
suck it it's worth noting that this is a
fully air-cooled system and I should
also preface the rest of this video with
a disclaimer that the results you're
about to see are not necessarily
indicative of every system out there due
to the near infinite variations of
system builds but at the very least
should offer some insight as to how
changes in case airflow effects
similarly built and/or Specht systems as
you can see I've positioned two of the
fans at the front of the case as intakes
and one at the rear for exhaust all of
them are wired to the fan headers on the
motherboard running at a fixed speed of
1,400 rpm with all the case fans in full
force I fired up GTA 5 and proceeded to
monitor our CPU and GPU temperatures for
15 to 20 minutes the end of our initial
run saw sustained CPU temperatures in
the 50s with the max package hitting 67
degrees Celsius our gtx 1070 which was
operating with an auto fan curve topped
out at 70 C both of which are reasonable
low temperatures no problems here then
in the middle of my gameplay like a
raging lunatic I simultaneously
unplugged all three maglevs and watch -
their blades
fall still I continued gaming like
nothing had happened
nervously waiting for the machine beside
me to burst into flames at any moment
but it never did in fact I played for
another 20 minutes without any signs of
overheating or throttling until finally
calling it quits and taking note of the
new temperatures our CPU which had hit
67 C previously was now at a blistering
74 degrees Celsius now a seven degree
increase should not be outright ignored
but this wasn't the hell scorched result
I was expecting similarly our GPU only
jumped five degrees hitting 75 C which
raises zero cause for concern
considering Nvidia zone Founders edition
cards run notably hotter at around 81
degrees Celsius now to be fair our CPU
and GPU aren't completely without help
here it would be unfair to dismiss the
effectiveness of the hyper 212 Evo orzo
Tech's custom cooler or even the ample
ventilation of the define s assuming you
remove all those pesky Majah vent covers
all of these contributors undoubtedly
helped our star components keep their
cool
despite significantly hampering our case
airflow I hope you guys don't
immediately toss out your case fans
after watching this video that's not at
all what I'm getting at here but I would
like to point out that the number of fan
mounts on today's average mid tower case
is higher than it ever has been and with
manufacturers fighting to make the
coolest blingiest RGB Ziya strands on
the market it's now easier than ever to
fall into this sort of obsession of
cramming as many fans into your case as
possible especially for new builders who
might mistake this trend as a necessity
for adequate system cooling when that's
simply not true
not to mention sexy fans don't come
cheap these days these three maglevs
alone add 75 dollars towards the cost of
our build here so if you're trying to
make the best use of your budget
perhaps that money is better spent
elsewhere in your rig just some food for
thought that's pretty much all I got for
now guys let me know what you think
about all this in the comments and if
you're brave enough try conducting your
own little fanless test at home and
share your results with the class be
really cool apologies in advance if your
system blows up it's not my fault
