channel today is just a bit of a vlog
slash channel update because there's a
lot to update you on and there's so much
going on right now with the channel most
of which is good they're mostly good
things some of it you can decide for
yourself whether or not it's good but
it's just kind of overwhelming to the
point where I feel like I need to share
it with you in order to just keep my
head straight and I feel like you're my
therapist right now I'm just kind of
venting to you guys but also hopefully
inform you on what's going on with the
channel first of which I'm going to
start with the more of a light-hearted
kind of not too controversial topic here
this is just a quick look at some
products that I have that I'll be
reviewing very shortly this is the all
the things or not all the things but
these are some of the things that are in
my video queue right now that people
have sent me and expect me to do videos
on so by golly I I guess I have to do
them but so just really quick we've got
the Strix Xin I'm gaming ROG motherboard
from Asus we've got a gigabyte g1 gaming
x a9 phoenix sli both of these kind of
just recently came out for the whole
Broadwell e launch we've got some video
cards here our X 480 this is the XFX
this is a reference by the way but it is
factory overclocked and comes with the
back plate
I was thinking about doing some
crossfire testing with this but J
already did a really good video on it on
his channel you can check that out but
if there's anything else that he might
have left out or whatever or any further
testing you'd want to see with one or
two R X 480 s let me know the GTX 1060 I
made a stupid rap about that you all
know I can't talk too much about that
yet but we've got the gtx 1070 from
ZOTAC saw that at Computex as well as
the msi gtx 1080 and then they give the
rog spider
it's like sparta it's like spa tore off
but it's spa spa interesting name
but rog mouse I believe it's Wireless o
yr Wireless or wired interesting and
then I've got the Tesoro gram keyboard
as mechanical switches although they are
kale I believe they're agile switches
which is like a rebrand of kale switches
there are low profile keys though which
is kind of interesting they sent me the
white one which is also unique so out of
all these products just let me know what
you'd want to see first cuz I don't know
I'm at a loss on how to prioritize these
because they really just came in at the
same time more or less so your feedback
on
that is much appreciated the other thing
I want to show you really quick this is
also pretty good stuff is that I'm
building a custom water-cooled PC yes
this is my second one ever since hot
line it's gonna be mini ITX and this has
nothing to do with the fact that pulp
just built a badass water cooling system
on his channel but GT X 1080 water
blocked there there's all this stuff
from ek which came in very recently hi
boy you're annoying so yeah not much
else I can tell you about that of then
small form-factor it's gonna be cool
literally and let's let's talk about the
meat the meat the meat and potatoes of
this video here at least some of it
actually that's a little low see I'm
drowning in video cards I'm just using
10 70s now to prop up my cameras it's a
real first world problem alright so the
other thing that I wanted to tell you
guys is that well I'm just gonna come
right out and say it this season this
ongoing current season of booted is
going to be the last season of the
series I'm canceling the show
indefinitely for an indefinite amount of
time I don't really know exactly if it's
gonna be forever or if it'll ever come
back but for now it's just you can
expect to not see it anymore after this
season and there's a couple reasons well
first off were on season 5 so I been
doing it for about half a year now about
five months and I realized that I wanted
to cancel it
after last month June the month that I
actually took a short hiatus because I
was in Computex in Taiwan that month so
I cancelled booted for just that one
month was the first time I had not done
a booted in four months and I realized
how much time it really takes up and I
felt like the quality of my videos last
month or just maybe five ten percent
better than the content that I've been
pumping out in the four months prior to
that when boo did was going on and I'm
already doing awesome hardware's on
Tuesdays so I don't want to sacrifice
too much of my video quality for my
regular recorded content you know
because I'm doing another live show and
I already do I
love doing awesome hardware with Paul
I'm not planning to cancel that anytime
soon that's another reason why I guess
I'm no longer gonna be doing the show is
because I feel like now with I'm only
pumping out to recorded videos more or
less a week and now with booted I have
like two live streams that I do a week
and so a newcomer
that's just gonna stumble across my
YouTube channel for the first time
they're gonna assess it on you know an
at-a-glance basis and I'm gonna say
alright does this guy have stuff that's
worth me subscribing for and they're
gonna see like half of its live streamed
half of my content is now live stream
because as weird as that sounds it just
doesn't jive well with the direction
that I want to take the channel I don't
want half of my stuff to be live
streamed on YouTube and I feel like
people on YouTube aren't necessarily is
interested in watching half an hour hour
two hour long live streams on that
platform as opposed to somewhere like
twitch so for those you know reasons I'm
just not gonna be doing the show anymore
and whoever wins this season of booted
will get zero cash prize because they
suck
no I'm just kidding you're still gonna
get whoever wins this season is
definitely going to get the Amazon or
steam gift card or whatever 500 bucks no
problem but after that I'm gonna be
cutting the show loose and that's kind
of just one of the things that I have to
do as a one-man band running this whole
 show by myself is I have to pick
and choose what content do I keep and
what what do I let go you know I can't
possibly do everything on my own because
I'm just one guy so the next thing the
final thing that I want to talk about
and this may cause an uproar there might
be pitchforks in the in the comments
section or you guys might not give a
 at all who knows do you guys even
care about what I'm saying I don't know
but there's a 80 to 85 percent chance
that within the next few weeks maybe
even sooner I don't know maybe in the
next six months who knows I will be
changing the channel name so
awesomesauce network as you know it will
be a thing of the past just the name
though all the content is going to be
completely unchanged I simply want to
rebrand the channel under a different
name and I was talking to fractal Josh
about this not too long ago and he put
it perfectly he said no I get it he was
like you know your channel name is kind
of like a tattoo that you got when you
were a teenager you don't necessarily
regret it but you've outgrown it
and that really rung true with exactly
how I feel about the name of the channel
and you know when I first started the
channel I don't know two three years ago
maybe even longer now I never thought
that it would be as big as it is now you
know and granted I still have a long
ways to go you know to the likes of like
Linus and Austin Evans and those guys
are giants legends legends but still I
just never imagined that the channel
would ever get as big as it is today so
I don't really put too much thought into
my channel name and I feel like I've
definitely outgrown it and I want it I
feel like putting myself in someone
else's shoes that's gonna be coming
across my channel if I if I went to a
YouTube channel for the first time and
it was called awesomesauce Network I'd
might I might think that it was you know
a 12 year old hosting the videos or
something you know it just sounds kind
of juvenile and I always kind of feel
like vendors might be you know raising
an eyebrow when I meet them for the
first time and I tell them my channel
namely because this guy for real
awesomesauce network what are you in
high school I don't know so maybe it's
it's definitely a personal thing you
know maybe an insecurity or you know
self-conscious thing but I want to be
proud of my channel name and I feel like
it's matured so much since when I first
started it back in the day so that's one
reason and also I just like to just
condense it make it a little shorter
easier to type easier to say easier to
fit on a business card what-have-you and
that's partially my fault right I made
it longer by changing it from
awesomesauce news originally to
awesomesauce network I actually made it
longer that's because I wasn't actually
pumping out any news content like I
thought I would be in the beginning but
but yeah so now it's just gonna be
something a little bit more sexy and
sleek who knows and I can't tell you
guys what ideas I have for the new name
yet because I still have to do a bunch
of legal stuff and find out if there's
any conflicts with existing brands or
channels or companies all that sort of
thing so stay tuned for that that will
probably be happening at some point and
just to reiterate apart from the channel
name and maybe a couple new t-shirt
designs on my store
none of the content on this channel is
going to change everything's still gonna
be me and my dumb face talking to you
guys through a camera that's that's all
gonna stay the same it's just the name
so I just want to make that clear but
that's pretty much it apart from I have
to take a crap
I really need a haircut those are really
all the announcements that I have for
you today and I really appreciate you
guys taking the time to check it out
so that's all have a good day have a
good rest of your weekend or whatever
time it is and leave me some feedback in
the comments let me know what you think
of all this stuff because I'm dying to
know your guys just thought so thanks
guys have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
