awesomesauce news today I will be doing
a review on Roseville's RK 9200 series
Helios mechanical gaming keyboard and
this keyboard is actually very
interesting because it is the world's
first dual LED keyboard so there are a
lot of LED modes and different
combinations that you can do which are
really cool I'm going to give you guys a
demo in just a bit but first off this
keyboard does feature Cherry MX black
switches that's the model I have with me
today but you can also get it in blue
brown or red switches as well so first
off I'm just gonna go over some of the
basic details I am gonna be comparing a
little bit of this keyboard to Rose
Wells arcane 9100 which I also did a
video on you can check that out later so
first off I want to point out that the
9200 has a very similar profile and
construction as the 9100 did and that's
a good thing because the profile is very
slim
the bezel is very thin it kind of
doesn't take up too much room it's not
too obtrusive and the construction is
just solid plastic you can press down on
any of the keys as hard as you want and
you won't see any flexing or any bowing
in the body itself you also get the
rubberized pads on the bottom as well
you've got to pop up feet also that just
kind of elevate the keyboard a little
bit a lot of people say that it kind of
helps them typing it's more ergonomic
and they notice less strain on their
wrists when they're when they've been
typing for long hours at a time one huge
improvement of this keyboard over the
9100 is a removable mini USB cable so
they've included Roseville's included a
six-foot braided cable it's very nice
it's got a velcro strap if you want to
tie out tie up any excess cable length
that is unneeded you also get ten key
number pad so for all of your accounting
needs you've got some web and multimedia
shortcuts as well and this keyboard does
feature twelve key rollover just kind of
scratching my head at first because you
would think maybe you would only need
ten key rollover at the most because you
only have ten fingers but I think
Rozsival has just done it just to say
hey look we've gone we've gone above and
beyond because we can and there's
nothing wrong with that also a really
cool feature at first I was looking at
the keyboard and I was like where the
heck is the windows lock key but the way
you do it on the 9200 is you hold down
the function key and then press the
windows key I actually really like that
idea because you're not taking up space
on your keyboard for a new dedicated
button rose
was kind of just working with what they
have and they've found a clever way to
quickly enable and disable that Windows
key well that said why don't we get into
some of the finer details of the led
functionality of this keyboard since
that seems to be one of the biggest
features of this product so first off
all of the keys are individually backlit
they each have two LEDs behind them and
they can turn either red or green so you
can actually have your entire keyboard
either red keys or green keys depending
on your preference but extending even
far beyond that to Rose Wells also
implemented isolated keys for your WASD
and your arrow keys so you can actually
turn those on and off independently of
the rest of your keyboard but this is
what sets this keyboard apart from many
of the other gaming keyboards I've seen
is that you can actually light up the
WASD and arrow keys one color and then
change all the other keys to a separate
color so you can see here we've got kind
of a dual led configuration and this is
really great because other gaming
keyboards I've seen the WASD Keys will
light up and that's great but then the
rest of them are black so when you're
gaming in the dark which a lot of people
like to do you might be gaming WASD
playing your first-person shooter and
then all of a sudden you got to type in
a message you know in group chat to one
of your buddies or one of your teammates
and all of a sudden you look down at
your keyboard and you can't see anything
you kind of have to calibrate in the
dark with your fingers all right all
right I'm on a SD where's my other hand
going and sometimes you know typos occur
so Roosevelts really made the moves to
kind of finding a solution for this
problem and it just seems like such a
simple solution but no one's been doing
it until now right so it's really cool
functionality I'd say this is probably
the paramount feature of this keyboard
and it's gonna save a lot of headache in
the long run with with the users that
decide to get one aside from that you've
also got three levels of LED brightness
that you can choose from from dim
brighter and brightest you've also got a
breathing mode which kind of induces a
slow pulsating effect between the
brightness levels of your keys
looks pretty cool now with all that said
this keyboard has really impressed me up
to this point but one critique I will
say is that the num lock caps lock and
scroll lock LED indicator lights for
this keyboard are in blue and I just
kind of wish that Rosewell would have
practiced a little bit more continuity
with the aesthetic of the keyboard by
either making the LEDs red or
or even better allow you to switch
between different colors that would more
appropriately match the current ones on
the rest of the keyboard all right so
let's just quickly recap some of the
pros and cons of the keyboard I really
like the slim profile and the durable
construction the removable USB cable
from the back is a great addition to the
RK series but let's face it guys the
number one feature here is definitely
the dual LEDs not only does it allow for
more customized ability and killer
aesthetics but just offers such a high a
much higher level of functionality than
you would get from most gaming keyboards
on the market currently I really hope to
see more keyboards like this from
Roseville in the future as far as the
cons go there's really not too much to
say here like I said earlier the lock
LED indicator lights were in blue I kind
of would have liked to see them in
either in green or red but like I said
it's just an aesthetic thing not
everyone's gonna mind it aside from that
other thoughts this isn't necessarily a
con this is just me talking now words I
would like to see more color
combinations in future models of this
keyboard from Roseville
I want to see red and blue LEDs on one
board or I want to see green and white
LEDs you know or maybe all of those in
one that you can just toggle between 30
different colors would be awesome so all
in all a very solid keyboard I
definitely recommend it to anyone
looking for a new one and yeah I think
that's pretty much it so thank you guys

has been Roseville's arcade 9200 helios
