booted thank you all for being so
patient in chat or not really patient at
all I know it was kind of teasing you
there for a minute but welcome back it's
good to have you all here if you guys
are first-timers welcome there is a
video somewhere else on the channel
explaining how the show works i'm not
going to get too into it but this is
season 2 episode 2 so we're about
halfway after after today's episode
we're going to be halfway through the
season which is very exciting they're
very short little seasons condensed into
each month of the year and this
particular season is focused around
budget rigs so all these pcs are really
trying to make do with with really the
limited budget that these builders have
we've got five new contestants today and
we had five contestants last week as
well and we did come out with a final
finalist last week who was Riker now
this is rhykker system he was last
week's finalist the first finalist for
for season two here with his trash 5,000
build now the live audience you guys
voted on this system so can't can't
criticize me but actually I kind of like
what what good old Ryker did here he
kind of knew where he stood he was very
self aware of the limitations that he
had with this system as you can see he
used pretty much a shoebox with gaff
tape for a power supply shroud but he
kind of ran with it and I really like
that he just kind of owned it more or
less and so this is his system he's got
a really nice cry rig h7 in there
beautiful cpu cooler and for the amount
of money he spent it actually doesn't
look too bad like I said there are a
couple of MacGyver moments in this
system but all together I think it was
one of the stronger contenders for last
week's episode so congratulations Riker
will be seeing you in week or and the
fight
round later this month as you compete
against two other finalists one of which
will be chosen by the end of tonight
very exciting stuff ladies and gentlemen
also on the agenda we do have a sponsor
spot so sponsored once again by the ever
amazing fantex where are you guys there
you are phanteks you guys are killing it
you've been killing it ever since you
joined the PC I don't know the pc case
market with all of your cases your cases
are brilliant and you have this new
power splitter I should say it's brand
new but it's one of your newer items and
for those of you unfamiliar the power
splitter I let me go ahead and show you
this this handy-dandy video that they
got right here how convenient the power
splitter is essentially this module
where you plug one power supply in into
the input and it's got to power outputs
so you can actually power two systems
with one power supply and not only can
you power both of them simultaneously
but you can of course run them
independently you can see once powered
on the other is powered off and vice
versa so really handy little unit
especially if you're gonna do a dual
system chassis speaking of which they
have this n through mini ex LDS which
would go perfectly with this with such a
device like the power splitter so these
two could really make a killer combo
this is a dual system chassis very
awesome i actually have one of these
that's been collecting dust in my
hallway that I've been really slacking
on doing a video on I'm actually kind of
waiting until I have enough parts to do
a dual system bill maybe I have a gaming
system down here with the micro ATX and
then maybe a streaming system up here so
you could actually get a lot more
performance for your hardware if you
have a dedicated streaming system
there's a lot of possibilities there but
all together really good stuff fantex
thank you again for sponsoring this
little show here we do appreciate it and
we'll be taking a look at some other
other stuff coming out later this month
and we'll circle back to that later but
on to our first victim our first
contestant I should say I'll try to be a
little less harsh I know you guys are
very sensitive this is the internet
after all and some of you guys are like
Callie you're pretty harsh you know
don't don't point out the stick in
someone's but unless you notice the
toothpick that's in your
I that's a famous saying I'm pretty sure
that's how it goes so I'll go a little
bit more easy on you guys today but this
is number one Mac PC number one is Mac
and I like that name that's a cool name
I'll name my future son that or my
future daughter she's she's up for it so
you got a cooler master Silencio 352
nice little budget case I even named the
FX 8320 also really good bang for the
buck processor there from AMD cpu
coolers a cm cooler master hyper 4 12's
you've also got an asus motherboard in
there eight gigs of g.skill sniper ram
and r9 270 nice little budget card in
there from asus nonetheless and a pretty
nice power supply for a budget system
the the RM the RM series from Corsairs
is it's pretty pretty sweet for the
money you get for the money you pay for
it and you managed to get a 250 gig
samsung 840 Evo in there but it doesn't
look like you have a hard drive actually
so that would be my first concern is if
you are playing games on this which you
might be if you have an hour 9270 I mean
if you weren't playing games and you
didn't really you weren't doing multi
monitor or something like that you could
probably just run off of some integrated
graphics although yeah I don't know how
that would work yeah scratch that so
you've got a light gaming system here
but I'm a little bit concerned about
your storage priorities I don't know if
you're going super budget which it looks
like you are I would almost prefer a
larger capacity hard drive over a
smaller faster SSD for example however
if you're just doing some really like
gaming in the games that you really want
to play aren't very large then hey that
works for me I have no complaints there
just just something to point out but
what else we got here so it looks really
clean from this angle cable management
is on point and again going back to that
power supply i mean the cables alone
make it worthwhile it just looks so much
cleaner here with some black flat cables
that i don't know really cleans things
up and you've managed to tidy them up
fairly well there's not a bunch of you
know wires hanging out at the frontier
by your by your two fans I do also like
how you have to front intake fans I
think that was a wise choice even
though the r9 270 is not going to get
very hot and your other components could
use some airflow it's never going to
hurt and um let's take a look at the
money shot mohnish what all right um I'm
trying I'm trying not to make this about
your photography skills cuz the flash
right now or not even the flash but just
the glare and reflection is killing me
but focus on the pc cow focus on the pc
uh yeah i mean this is this is looking
pretty good man i also like how you
three want to be quiet silent wings to
fan in the back and that rear exhaust
that's a really massive fan i actually
just put two of them in my r9 nano built
in the the node 202 and those have been
doing a really good job I've actually
been seeing like 34 degrees cooler
temperatures on the r9 nano after
installing those fans so I like how
you've kind of made this a premium feel
you've kind of created a premium feel
here with your very budget system and
can't go wrong with the hyper anything
from coolermaster cooling your CPU I
think that's good got a few optional
shots here which were a little confusing
I mean maybe you're just really proud of
that power supply and I guess I can't
fault eat too much for that and you're
also very proud of this asus heatsink
that's on your motherboard which is why
you sent me an entire picture dedicated
to only that but that's cool oh I almost
I almost revealed your cable management
shop that would be bad ah ah Mack all
together pretty solid my man pretty
solid not too much to complain about
here I do wish however you taken that
sticker off of the top of your power
supply there that is a bit of an eyesore
altogether not bad move on to our little
badass oo oo oo bad a thaw I don't know
why every Robert I come across i have to
introduce the message or bad oh i don't
know it's probably offensive in some way
you've got a thermaltake versa h22 i'm
drinking a cab by the way some cabin a
solo yo okay delicious so you've got a
thermaltake case which i'm not too
familiar with it definitely is budget
though you've got a G 32
eight solid dual-core processor in there
just did a video on that stock cooler
msi h81 so you're on the h81 platform
you've also got eight gigs of ram and r9
270 as well so this is another similar
video card except this one's from
gigabyte and you've also got a one
terabyte seagate barracuda so you want
the more like the more common route of a
budget PC where you just invest in one
mechanical drive and you save up for the
SSD later which you know we saw a
different kind of strategy with Mac
earlier but I think both can work
depending on your use case needs and you
got a rebel fortress in there 650 watt
power supply and I know that is for sure
80 plus certified okay so looking at
looking out the side profile here you've
got some gold you get though go die love
goat and um you know I can dig it I can
actually dig it I think that I'm kind of
amazed how your makeshift power supply
shroud or your power supply cable shroud
anyway and the the copper trim that you
put on the video card their matches
perfectly with the Aries dims and I
think that's the native color I don't
think you spray-painted those we can
take a closer look at the money shot
yeah that's the natural color of those
dims Aries and their funky colors and
you manage to match that up with the
video card and and cable shroud quite
nicely I don't know what exactly you use
some kind of I don't know if it's
wrapping paper or whatever but it looks
pretty good I mean for for a homemade
job for a hack job thing I mean it looks
better than the trash 5000 I'm sorry
Ryker but I think I think Robert though
definitely has you beat in that arena at
the very least so I like the copper
theme it definitely adds some
personality to what would otherwise be
just a dime a dozen budget rig and I
think that's the hardest thing about
budget systems is to give your really
cheapo pc a personality when you don't
have much moolah to work with and you
manage to do that here mostly through
DIY means and I like that it's cool man
it's very cool it's take another closer
look at this money shot you've also put
a black sticker on top of your intel
stock cooler and
I think that is a great idea as long as
it's executed well and it looks pretty
good here um seasoned ones winner the
grand prize winner ha no ha no he he did
the same thing but his sticker or
whatever it was was all bubbly and it
looked like it looked like digiorno
pizza you know that had just burnt
really badly right on top of his stock
cooler and didn't look all that great I
give him a hard time for that but you
men should do a pretty good job here it
is noticeable I can tell that it's
clearly either a sticker construction
paper or something but for the most part
it looks a lot better than the than ha
no so good on you mate for that one and
yeah I'm very curious to know what that
cable shroud here by your power supply
is made of because it looks pretty solid
it doesn't look too cardboard he looks
very flat and and straight I'm wondering
if it's just a piece of metal that you
have you put some some copper ish accent
on I'm very curious maybe I'll maybe
I'll email you later and find out and
cable management isn't horrible
obviously you're working with a case
that isn't exactly tailored for that but
I think you could have probably routed
those two SATA cables along with your
front panel connectors because it looks
like they're just they're going to
different ways and I feel like you could
have consolidated those a little bit
better and there's also some cable mess
that's below your hard drive in the tray
I guess I can't fault you too much for
that because again crappy cases man
crappy cases they really do make a big
difference let's go ahead and move on to
PC number three Ian you are lucky that
you're even on this show and I'll tell
you why my friend I'll tell you why
because initially I said whoever submits
a portrait oriented photo will be
automatically disqualified but I didn't
disqualify you for some reason I was
like you know what screw it bring him in
lets everyone you know I'm feel like the
college that I was accepted to I just
I'll just take anyone at this point but
luckily this was your only portrait
photo but guys
gonna submit your pc's to booted make
sure its landscape no one wants to see
this looks like it was taken on an
iphone only iphone users do that dan you
all also speaking of which really quick
side note that i forgot to mention at
the beginning of the episode is that at
the end of the show tonight I will be
announcing the theme for season 3 and at
the right things have been going you
guys can probably guess it's pretty it's
fairly predictable what the theme is
going to be but there are a few more
details involved than what you might
think so stay tuned for the end of the
show I will be announcing not only the
theme the pc theme but also the
submission dates so if you're interested
in submitting your rigs you'll know
exactly which dates you can do that yeah
fun fun stuff stay tuned for that all
right so you've got a leader tech gamer
case which I've never heard of not too
surprising a core i5 4460 strong strong
haswell cpu there you've also got a
stock cooler b85 motherboard from
gigabyte eight gigs of ram from crucial
ballistix sport and r9 270 this is like
the episode of the 270's the r9 270 s 3
that's 3 r-9 to 70 s in a row and I did
not plan that but just I kind of
randomized these these entries for today
400 watt power supply and I one terabyte
seagate barracuda but aye khuda all
right Ian see what you're working with
here all right I said that I wasn't
gonna be very harsh on today's episode
so you know you got ketchup and mustard
you got some ketchup and mustard in
there it's just the nature of the beast
dealing with a budget system and I'm not
gonna I'm not going to knock you any
points even though the points in the
show don't matter anyway I'm gonna leave
that entirely up to the audience if they
want to uh you know look right past it
then by all means um however the stock
cooler I mean yeah the blue sticker
kills it for me it always does I mean
Roberto did a really nice job with that
as we just saw covering it up and also
the you know here's a
tip for a Ian and for anyone who else
who this might apply to in the future
the the intel stock cooler the best
thing i like to do what i like to do is
actually i would flip this cooler 180 so
that the the cable lead the cable would
actually lead right out from the top and
i wouldn't use the routing the routing
uh latches around the cooler because you
can still see it I mean it routes the
cable but it's still visible so I would
have just flipped it 180 and just tucked
it underneath the power supply out of
sight I mean even if it's not completely
out of sight it's still right underneath
the power supply so you get a nice
shadow covering it you don't see it as
much but you know what for this crappy
little later tech gamer case that you
have here your cable management is
pretty on point sir i will give you
points for that you you're definitely
not afraid of zip ties which is really
good you've done a nice job hiding them
up and also keeping them kind of towards
the the motherboard tray towards the
side of your case and not just dangling
writing the right in the center as to
impede any air flow that might be coming
from the front of your system now i'm
not sure if you've got a front intake
fan i hope so here's another look at
your video card there yeah this the case
is really your limiting factor here but
for what you've managed to do with the
case I think I'm pretty impressed by the
way you need to really dust your system
and your the PCB on your video card is
it's pretty bad so uh that would be
probably my biggest critique here uh-huh
and maybe in the future get some dins
with the heat spreaders on that might
look cool yeah and we get get some some
little heat spreader action in there it
is it is quite dusty that's right all
right Thank You Ian let's go ahead and
move on to PC number 4 whoa it's getting
hot in here jaysus and I don't turn the
AC on because it's noisy for you guys I
just
sacrifice so much for you for all of you
i know i know i'm awesome all right josh
Josh back at it again with the fractal
core 1000 now if this is fractal Josh
who submitted his crappy budget rig and
he's reppin fractal I'm gonna strangle
you when I first saw this I couldn't
stop laughing cuz it's his name's Josh
and it's a fractal case so I instantly
think fractal Joshua for those of you
don't know Frank josh is a close buddy
and I don't know colleague of mine in
the industry who works a fractal design
they make good cases like this one and
he's known for being a jokester so
wouldn't be surprised with was him but
no it's definitely not him I can confirm
email address was definitely not
something that Josh would have signed up
for uh but here we go we've got an AMD
a10 7850 k paired with an r 7 360 00 you
broke the cycle i was hoping for a 270
but you know i can only dream um but you
know that's cool if your GPU ever dies
you could just do some like gaining off
of that APU yeah yeah not bad Hank Brad
yo you've also got an a 88 x motherboard
on the FM two plus socket you didn't
specify how much memory you had and I
didn't care to check but I'm guessing
you've got 48 gigs really got eight gigs
got an hour seven three sets to 60 in
there I can probably guess you've got
eight gigs in there you've got a cooler
master TX 3 all right that's kind of a
smaller cooler I think there's a 90
millimeter fan on that or an 80
millimeter fan I'm not sure and you've
also got a one tear gut one terabyte a
one terabyte see bait Barracuda
Barracuda I don't know EVGA for 30 watt
power supply all right so looking at
this thing let's go ahead and take a
look at the money shot yeah you know
what all the cable management in these
systems is pretty good today cable
management is on point good job budget
people and the thing about the core 1000
in cases like it and a lot of the other
cases that we've seen today is
you'll really have the option to route
any cables behind the motherboard tray
like you would with a a mid-range or
high-end case so you really are limited
to you know you got to be more creative
and cable management really does take a
bit more time and thought I kind of kind
of got a plan of roadmap to how to best
get rid of all these cables out of those
hot spots but seems like you did a good
job here got a lot of cables that are
hovering up here in the five and a
quarter inch base I wish that the cables
on the bottom where your your i/o
connectors are your front panel
connectors were a bit more tight you
could have maybe zip-tied those together
instead of just letting the wall run
freely at the floor of your case I think
that would have been cool um but you
know what this is a really well put
together system take another look at
this money shot can't really see too
much here obviously you know you cables
aren't the prettiest but what are you
gonna do it's a budget system now this
is interesting because you've got some
LED action going on here but it looks
like they're the light source is coming
from outside of your case like the front
of your heat sink is illuminated but
really nothing else is so I'm guessing
you just have like a purple light
somewhere in your room that you're
casting down on here but you wanted to
throw that in as an optional picture and
you've got the second one here where
there's more pink or purple lighting
coming from an external source outside
of your case but we also see a new
addition here you've revealed a front
fan I think that's a 120 because that's
what the the only type of fan for 1,000
supports and it has a purple led in it
so you put a purple LED fan in here and
I like that points I don't know why I
just just like it all right I have no
bias I don't like girly colors and
systems pcs that's shut up
oh yeah uh I don't know I kind of I
don't know have like a weird I must add
fetish it's not a fetish shut up stop
putting words in my mouth I like it when
i see budget systems that have
personality I don't know what it is it's
like they're people too except they're
not people they're people with video
cards in them uh yeah I don't know kind
of like that good call on the purple fan
there Josh yeah buddy alright let's go
to our fifth and final contestant for
today who is Lester good ol Lester
that's a fun name yes sounds like a
villains name like a super villain we
must I don't know I couldn't do anything
right now Diablo tech I already don't
like this case uh Diablo tech has been
known to make some crappy products but
but because they're dirt cheap right and
if it's what you can afford it's what
you can afford however regardless of
that i am not too sure why you are
missing some crucial elements here on
the case including a five and a quarter
inch panel on the frontier and also all
of your expansion slots except one so I
don't know if you lost them I don't know
how you'd lose them if you're not
installing anything there but this just
seems like an open invitation for dust
in your system I don't correct me if I'm
wrong guys i'm not sure but yeah you've
also got an FX 4100 here as well as a
gtx 460 kicking it old school alright so
there is a bit of quite a bit of cable
clutter i have to say your cable
management is probably the weakest out
of the competition here today Lester
sorry about that also look at that power
supply holy moly that is a sight for
sore eyes murdered nurse um I do like
how you have a fan right here at the
front that's right next to your gtx 460
i'm sure that thing can get hot once in
a while arm
but yeah I mean it's not it's not
horrible I wish it was a lot cleaner I
wish you would take that power supply
sticker off and save us all a migraine
but you know I like that you have a lot
of airflow in the system that's one
thing I will say it does look like
there's no shortage of intake uh for any
of your components here and that's
that's good also what's up with the
what's up with the optical track what's
it called like words the optical drive
isnt even plugged in there's like no
power there's no se de anything it's
just it's just hanging in there just
hanging out it's just collecting you
know just not paying rent I don't know
it's weird weird bra I hope I hope you
know you need to plug it in I hope you
don't just think like damn this optical
drive doesn't work it's never worked
since the day I got it I hope you know
that uni actually need to power it on
and plug in the data cable in order for
it to do its thing just throwing it out
there mr. Lester all right I think
that's pretty much it for the five
contestants aww rest in peace headphone
users ed do you guys notice that I'm
really red oh I'm super sunburnt because
I was snowboarding this weekend with my
wife and Paul actually from Paul's
hardware and and some friends and I
didn't put sunscreen on cuz I'm like no
I'm Brown I'm Brown the Sun doesn't pay
attention to me it doesn't care see out
of that one's brown am I gonna make an
attack him today but no apparently the
Sun does not discriminate and I like
that i have more respect for the Sun now
than I ever had before only after its
burned my face but sorry if I look if
I'm scary right now so um guys at this
point my beautiful wife is going to be
posting some crap in the chat some links
some very important links one of which
is a photo album set of all the
contestants that we've looked at here
today make sure you look through all
thoroughly guys pay close mind at the
pros and cons of each system and then
the other link that she'll be putting in
chat right about now is the voting link
where you guys can vote on which pc
deserves to go on to the final round in
week 4 which is going to be the 28th
March 28th boom all right so guys think
very carefully on what you who you want
to see go on to the final round who
deserves to go up against the trash
5,000 the trash 5,000 from good ol Riker
all right this is what this is what the
today's contender is currently up
against all right trash five fat 50 it
ain't no slouch man it ain't no slouch
all right so while you guys are thinking
that over considerably and carefully
we're going to go ahead and take a look
once again at our sponsor for today who
is fantex phanteks back at it again with
the evolved ATX I'm going to stop saying
that one day I promise this case is
absolutely phenomenal dimitri from
hardware canucks good buddy of mine gave
this case chassis of the year for 2015
that's when it came out and by golly do
I agree with it it's just a beautiful
case inside and out phenomenal internal
layout just all the bells and whistles
and not too damn expensive for what you
get just unbelievable build quality and
things like that and also some really
nice color choices galaxy silver super
sexy r r and anthracite grey I really
like the names of these satin black I
think I think I'm just gonna buy the one
that sounds the coolest but yeah really
awesome case links to all this stuff in
the description by the way guys and if
you already know about this case and
you're like yeah it's old news Kyle yeah
yeah Kyle don't care anymore Kyle your
old cow well do I have a surprise for
you which you guys are also probably
know about later this month very soon in
fact fantex is coming out with a full
tempered glass side panel version of the
enthu evolved ATX
boom baby look at that look at that
oh god it looks so beautiful oh I just
want to you don't know you don't know
what I won't do what I want to do to
this thing oh but yes this is coming out
folks please and gelin later that's not
it later this month it's coming out
really soon and it just shows off all of
your components that much better guess
what the tempered glass is also on both
sides of the chassis so not only you're
going to get to look at all of your
goodies here your video card and
motherboard and things like that but you
get to see all of your cable management
wrapped up nice and tidy as well so it's
good motivation I think I don't I like
showing off that side of your case
because it motivates you to give a
about that side of your system which is
often overlooked and cable management
says cable cable management team
umizoomi yay cable management is a very
rewarding activity that can bring you
lots of joy and entertainment while
you're doing it so guys if you're
interested at any of these things go
ahead and click one of the links below
in the description who you also buy a
shirt like this one look at it's my stay
positive shirt Galloway wine glass you
can buy a state well I'm sweaty I'm
really sweaty is that wine no that's
probably just sweat all right this is
getting really disgusting go ahead and
pick up a shirt if you want new shirt
design coming out really soon but on
that note ladies and gentlemen why don't
we go ahead and take this to the voting
screen dun dun dun dun dun duh ah there
we go all right now I got a key like the
the dramatic music it's all it's all
creepy and scary now okay so um I know a
lot of you guys just ruined it by
looking at all the results ahead of time
like I already know pc number whatever
one but for those of you who have a
sense of adventure and a sense of
suspense and surprise thank you for not
looking ahead of
ahead of time and I still I'm going to
try to find a different survey system
that doesn't reveal the results until I
want them to be revealed because I think
that'll really amp things up and make
things a bit more tense and exciting but
for now I'll just go ahead and stay at
the obvious and see and we'll see which
one which of these pc's wins it's B's in
number two whoa again by a landslide pc
number two congratulations and number
one for three and five you guys gave it
your best but in the end you were booted
I'm sorry I am really sorry about that
so that leaves us to pc number two who
is Roberto I with the copper that get it
again with the copper power splash
shroud whoo yeah you know what this was
uh this is yeah live audience you nailed
it I think this was a very deserving of
the win honestly it was it was a it was
a pretty close tie actually I was a
pretty close game here I think it could
have gone slightly different route but
I'm very happy with this decision and I
obviously see why you guys went with
good old Robert here yeah beautiful
stock cooler there buddy beautiful stock
cooler we will be seeing you around nope
yeah round four round for a week for up
up in on two weeks and two weeks so next
week we're gonna go check out the season
the the week three finalists we're gonna
go I don't um say anymore what am I
saying I'm tired next week is our last
week our last five contestants and we're
gonna vote on one more finalist and then
the three finalists will compete the
week after that in week four you guys
know how it goes you guys are familiar
by now I'm sorry that you missed it you
can go ahead and watch it later they
will be re-uploaded whoever river and
chat missed it but guess what guys
season three submissions
they're now open so the submission
period starts now and ends March 21st
you have until March 21st to submit your
pc to booted now bear in mind this is
the theme for season three is high-end
pcs specifically rigs that are
approximately fifteen hundred dollars in
value or greater I repeat approximately
fifteen hundred dollars in value or
greater you can interpret that however
you want like what the market price was
at the time when you bought them or the
market price what they are now but I
think you guys have a pretty good idea
of what high-end pcs mean now if you
look in the description also no custom
water cooling allowed no no custom water
cooling okay that'll have its own
separate season later on so if you guys
are interested in what should we call it
submitting your PC your high-end rig to
booted for for next month season three
go ahead and check the description below
you'll find a link that leads you here
this is a new page that I just put up
and it sits on the awesomesauce network
com site so don't go to the video
actually privatize the video because it
was causing too much confusion and there
were too many annotations it was like
diseased with annotations so this is a
lot more simple to grasp a hold of and
just breathe read the instructions
carefully guys read the instructions
carefully that's all I have to say if
you want to submit your high-end PC to
booted and all will be well I'm really
looking forward to this next season
because um you know I first started the
show or when I first announced it
everyone's like oh it's going to be a
complete money contest whoever has the
most money to spend on their system is
clearly going to win every single season
and that's why I specifically wanted
different seasons with different themes
to give every tier or multiple tiers of
PC builders a chance to win the grand
prize which is why we're doing a budget
season this month for example and a
mid-range season last month but you know
what there is something to be said about
a nice somewhat pricey system because
you have a lot more wiggle room you have
a lot more options when it comes to
aesthetics and I think you know we all
know by now you got to spend a little
bit of dough if you really want your rig
to pop and look pretty and all that sort
of thing so I think next next season is
gonna be pretty good and guys I don't
know where all the good PCs are at I
mean I was expecting I don't want to
sound harsh on anyone's pc but I just
felt like there would be better pcs this
season and last season so at the rate
things are going I'd say if you have
like confidence in your in your high-end
rig submit your PC because so far there
have been few systems that have really
wowed me in both of these at both of
these levels the mid-range and budget
and I feel like hell people have a
really good shot of winning they really
do especially right now and when the the
show so early on and now we're getting
into the dramatic music again so I'm
gonna go ahead and skip over to the
happy stuff so yeah guys if you even
think you have a remote chance of of
standing a chance in this series you
should definitely go for it make your
dreams come true okay okay you guys want
to catch booted live airs on mondays of
five-thirty p.m. pacific on the youtubes
