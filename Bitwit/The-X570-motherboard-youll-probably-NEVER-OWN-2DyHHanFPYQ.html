brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below
we're here to asrock booth and i'm
taking a look at this beautiful bastard
the X 570 aqua this is gonna be sold in
limited edition quantities 999 units
available with a nice level branding
there if you can sort of geek out and
show up to your friends but it's got
nine hundred and ninety nine dollar
price tag that's right a cool grand for
this board but you can kind of see why
they actually have an integrated water
block from Coolermaster actually who
designed the water block as well as this
aluminum housing here which is beautiful
there's a water block on the x5 70
chipset as well as the CPU and the
entire vrm solution which is absolutely
phenomenal the other cool thing about
this board is that supports Wi-Fi 6
which is pretty common for all the x5 70
board so far but even cooler than that
is the support for Thunderbolt 3 and I'm
sorry it's really dark in this little
corner here but Thunderbolt 3 is
supported generally you only see the
support on Intel boards but now we're
seeing it creep its way into the new AMD
platform which is super exciting being
able to drive so much data through a
single cable whether you're talking
video or USB any kind of connectivity
like that very exciting so from azrog I
can't wait to see this guy in action we
also have something a bit more
mainstream this is the x5 70 creator 10
face power delivery here it's actually
10 plus 2 do you have a fan here on the
on the on the chipset along with 2 m2
PCIe gen gen 4x4 slots you can see it's
a bit more bare-bones there's no RGB
which i think is actually kind of a plus
in some cases and there's no like cover
here for the IO shield or for the IO
area of course we do have the x5 70 Pro
which is definitely a bit more targeted
to gamers is also a 10 + 2 phase power
design we also have 1 &amp;amp; 2 m dot 2 slots
PCIe Jen for and down here this is
actually pretty exciting the x5 70 M
throw for this is the first and only x4
x5 70 micro ATX motherboard that we've
seen here at Computex no other vendor is
actually making these right now the
motherboard vendors are actually
following the trends of the case vendors
to see what kind of form factor
motherboards they can be making most and
right now there's kind of a dearth of
really cool micro ATX cases so this is
the only one however if you are all
about the micro ATX form factor which I
certainly am they do have the
five seventy empro for here if you want
something even more compact we have the
x5 70 phantom gaming ITX TV three TV
three against any four Thunderbolt 3
which means yes you can actually connect
Thunderbolt 3 to the back here there it
is
it should be there it is ok it's really
hard to see back here Thunderbolt 3
right there I'm kind of like the the
design I wish they went more color
neutral instead of having red accents
that would have been a little bit more
forgiving on people who want to truly
customize the look of their systems you
get a fan it's kind of slanted kind of
fan of slant at on the X 570 chips up
there which is connected to the vrm
heatsink here by way of heat pipe so
this is providing active cooling not
just to the chipset but the BRM as well
of course you've got an additional
heatsink up here to DIMM slots ddr4 with
higher speeds than we saw on X 470 and
if you look at the socket itself it's
actually really interesting they're
using a non-traditional LGA 1151 socket
mounting system here for CPU coolers
that I was like what the heck it's
because on a traditional a m4 socket it
actually takes up a lot more space to
have to have the mounting hole situated
like this and so when a mini ITX form
factor as ROC said they would have had
to compromise and sacrifice certain
features by putting the standard a m4
socket mounting solution onto this board
so instead they decided to do something
really wild and throw some LGA 1151
action in there pretty interesting next
up we have the x5 70 phantom gaming 4
which is sort of the ATX version of the
Mini ITX board we just saw I'm not going
to talk too much about that a little bit
more interesting is the x5 70 phantom
gaining access is one of their flagship
boards you have tons of RGB lighting
again with the red accents not sure what
that's about but this actually gets a 12
plus 2 phase power design with dr. Moss
so that's going to be a higher quality
MOSFETs increased efficiency and lower
thermals overall fantastic board if
you're going to overclock additionally
have the x5 70 Taichi you guys are all
familiar with this series
I love the actual designs here they're
talking about a next revision actually
incorporating this sort of steampunk
wheel to be spinning I think that would
look pretty sweet of course you have a
very nice RGB aesthetic again 12 + 2
face power design here 12 for the CPU 2
for the memory controller upgraded
connections for the EPS 12-volt
connectors 8 8 + 4 pin I don't believe
this is this is not part of the
the patient solution but this is this
aluminum heatsink certainly is heat pipe
in between both of those and yeah damn
this is I think this is their their
actual flagship mainstream board it
cannot if you're not counting the X 570
aqua all these words from as rocks are
looking extremely promising and the fact
that they're coming out with so many x5
seventy boards on launch for the riser
3000 series just shows how confident
they are in AMD's next-gen platform very
exciting stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
