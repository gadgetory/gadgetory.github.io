the drop before it's gone what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel so
after testing the four year old gaming
PC that I found on Craigslist last week
I promised I would soon post a quick
follow-up video to see if I could build
a faster PC using brand new hardware
with the same 550 dollar budget
now with GPU and memory prices at an
all-time high buying used parts
particularly older components which
haven't been affected by the inflation
seems like a good place to turn at the
same time there's also a decent
selection of current gen Hardware that
gets you a lot of bang for the buck so
we'll be pitting these two approaches
against each other today and seeing how
they stack up now while the Craigslist
rig here didn't blow us away by any
means
it was certainly playable getting
anywhere from 40 to 60 FPS at 1080p on
medium settings depending on the game
and that was mostly thanks to the
system's Intel Core i5 35 70 K and MSI
Radeon HD 7850 now it's up to me to
build something faster now obviously
this isn't my first rodeo when it comes
to picking parts on a tight budget but
given the current state of the market I
had to be super frugal and strategic
when choosing hardware for my build my
processor of choice was the new AMD
Rison 320 200 G APU which packs 4 cores
and 4 threads just like the Intel chip
it's up against a $99 MSRP makes this a
tough part to pass up I spent 50 bucks
on an asrock a 320 m dgs micro ATX
motherboard whose chipset denies us any
cpu overclocking capabilities but it's
just about the best board I could
squeeze into our very tight budget
that's paired with a dual channel 8
gigabytes of Crucial ddr4 at 2400 speed
that I scored for just 86 bucks
quote-unquote just 86 bucks while the
big of graphics on our apu are adequate
for light gaming
probably need a little bit more
horsepower to rival the Radeon HD 7850
so I managed to snag a GTX 1050 2
gigabyte card from MSI for a hundred and
fifty four dollars as for storage case
and power supply
I had to round up some budget hardware
that we had lying around the office
including a 120 gig hyper x 3k SSD a one
terabyte Seagate Barracuda hard drive a
terrifying 350 watt lodge's power supply
and a thermal take versa h22 case
although these components aren't
perfectly suited for our budget they
have no impact on gaming performance and
can easily be swapped out for similar
parts to meet our budgetary needs which
is why I felt it was ok to use them for
today's tests tossing in a second hand
key of Windows 10 brings the total cost
of our ideal budget PC to just north of
550 dollars to mitigate any effects the
silicon lottery might have on our test
results I've actually left the CPU and
GPU for both systems at their stock
frequencies the only thing I've tweaked
is the memory in our AMD system
overclocking it slightly to 29 33
megahertz due to rise in supreme
dependency on memory speeds final things
to note I am using the latest bios and
drivers for both systems and you'll
forgive today's suite of benchmarks
being rather brief as I did begin
encountering some crashes when trying to
run certain titles on our Craigslist PC
be that as it may I think we have more
than enough data to draw some
conclusions so diving right in with 3d
mark firestrike my DIY PC shows
significant gains right out of the gate
with a 25% lead in the overall score and
a whopping 28% for the graphics score if
you think these numbers are a telling
sign of what's to come next you're right
Cinebench r15 which tests CPU
performance shows the $99 rise in APU
outperforming the 35 70 K which was
nearly $300 when it first launched six
years ago hotdamn have we come a long
way in its defense when I left the 35 70
K at its overclocked of 4.1 gigahertz it
did beat out the APU in this test albeit
by a very small margin in battlefield 1
our used system trails it's modern rival
with the DIY rig scoring six extra
frames per second for an 11% increase on
average the only small victory for the
Craigslist PC here is that it's
1% lows are quite a bit stronger however
this probably won't make a huge
difference in practice the Rison machine
crushes the competition in Doom with a
36 percent lead and average frame rates
while hitting the 60fps mark for its 1%
lows while they used rigged can
definitely handle doom at this setting
we get a much smoother experience on the
current gen system our last title was
GTA 5 and we saw the continued trend of
our AMD rig pulling ahead an average FPS
of 83 equates to a 38% gain with 1% lows
looking strong as well again the
Craigslist PC manages to score higher
0.1% lows in a futile attempt to prove
its dominance in the end the Craigslist
PC put up a good fight but it just
couldn't hang with the modern day system
it was actually really interesting to
see just how similar the cpu performance
was between the 35 70 K and the 2200 G
but even if you can find one on eBay for
dirt cheap buying an Ivy Bridge chip in
2018 doesn't make a whole lot of sense
when you can still get a well priced CPU
that does great for 1080p gaming has a
solid upgrade path and sports a modern
architecture that developers are
currently optimizing their games around
on the graphic side of things the GTX
1050 reminded us today how equipped it
is for 1080p gaming as well and the fact
that it hasn't felt the full effects of
inflation like many other cards makes it
an accessible option for most users the
card also seems to pair very nicely with
our rise in APU building a PC with
brand-new parts proved to be the better
choice for today's little experiment but
the tables could have easily turned had
we found a better deal on used hardware
in our local area and there's no real
black-and-white here either using a
combination of new and used parts might
be the best option at any rate while
these extreme price hikes certainly make
a high-end gaming PC unobtainable for
most of us it's nice to know that we can
still build a good entry level system
that handles full HD gaming like a
friggin champ that's all I got for now
guys but let me know if you're being
affected by the market prices right now
and if you've somehow found a way to
circumvent the situation I'm sure we'd
all like to hear about it you can also
toss me a like on this video if you
enjoyed it it helps us a lot get
subscribed to the channel so you don't
miss any more content coming real soon
and follow me on floatplane to watch all
of my videos a week early without ads
for 3 bucks a month I'll drop a
for it in the description apart from
that guys thank you so much for watching
have a good one and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
