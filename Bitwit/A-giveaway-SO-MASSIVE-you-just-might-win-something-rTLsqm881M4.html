doing a massive giveaway it's actually
called giveaway for the holiday it's a
collaboration giveaway with Paul from
Paul's hardware and Brian from bps
customs and a whole bunch of vendors
including Asus Corsair enter Mac's
Thermaltake be quiet birdy gear EVGA
Coolermaster gigabyte and source customs
and computer upgrade kit there's gonna
be a total of 21 prize winners in this
thing so you actually have a better
chance of winning something in this
giveaway than any giveaway I've ever
done ever the prices range from video
cards to motherboards to computer cases
to monitors and so much more in fact the
full prize list can be found in the
giveaway link in the video description
below but hang on just one sec there's a
couple things to note you have to be 13
years old or over in order to enter if
this giveaway drops before your ball
bearings have you just can't enter them
sorry now this is mostly an
international giveaway but due to local
law and import taxes in certain
countries only some of the prizes will
be available internationally if you
don't live in the United States don't
freak out too much you can still win a
bunch of cool stuff like a verdict your
gaming chair NZXT case z 390 motherboard
from gigabyte or even a gigabyte RT x 27
now to enter the only thing you actually
have to do that's mandatory is be
subscribed to my Paul and Brian's
YouTube channels but there are a handful
of bonus entries that will increase your
odds of winning so be sure to check that
out in the giveaway link now we're
trying to get all these prizes to you
guys before Christmas so for that reason
we're gonna end this giveaway a week
from today
all 21 winners who have been drawn will
receive an email from Brian I typically
recommend not opening his emails but
this is different and you'll have 48
hours to respond to his email or your
prize will be forfeited and a new winner
will be chosen finally if you just want
to rack up some karma points feel free
to say thank you to all of the vendors
who are participating as well as Paul
and Brian on their social media channels
that's gonna do it for me guys thank you
so much for tuning in good luck to all
who enter and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
