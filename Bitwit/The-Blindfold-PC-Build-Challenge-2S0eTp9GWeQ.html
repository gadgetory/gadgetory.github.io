tempered glass side panel front panel
USB 3.1 type C and a reversible
motherboard tray for a complete custom
look extensive water cooling support and
cable management to make this a great
case for your next silent build click
the link in the description below for
more info how's it going guys welcome
back to the channel hope you're all
doing well
today I'm joined by Chris the intern he
has agreed to let us all publicly
ridicule him but it's okay because you
guys will be able to publicly ridiculed
myself as well as we are gonna be doing
a bit of an interesting build off it's
gonna be a speed challenge aesthetics
cable management's is kind of out the
window on this one Chris has maybe built
one PC before ever right and that was
actually a pretty recent does that even
technically count as the builders I'm
I'm gonna say that it does just to make
myself feel better in case you beat me
today obviously you guys might consider
this an unfair matchup since I'm more or
less a seasoned builder at this point
which is why today I'll be challenging
Chris building a PC blindfolded the
entire time and this is something that I
personally have never done before so
it's going to be a real test to see how
well I know my stuff and and and yuzu
and Chris as well look front panel
connectors I will be able to do those
without the blindfold cheater but
everything else I think everything else
I think that's pretty much it right
that's a little that's the only handicap
I really get cheater but Chris any any
last words before I decimate you while
blindfolded better trust your senses it
was very actually good advice well you
know what they you know what they say
Chris when one sense goes another one
gets better so I'm gonna use it so I'm
yeah that's I hear that all the head
anyway it doesn't matter so let's go
ahead and assume the position not lit up
in there like you know so let's go ahead
and take our seats and get this show on
the road
welcome you're going down Chris all
right so we pretty much have a near
identical set of hardware per table
they're both a m4 we're doing a rising
build with you know
founders edition geforce cards on my
hava 1060 he's got a 1070 more or less
the build experience is gonna be pretty
much the same I'd say the biggest thing
is that we have different cases I
haven't defined s he has the new define
our six which are have pretty similar
internal layouts basically the way that
I've configured the r6 in its current
state
but yeah the only difference is that he
will have a power supply basement I will
not
which is why cable management is not
going to factor into you know who wins
this is pretty much just a speed build
whoever gets to boot the lifting and
then decide yeah you guys couldn't argue
amongst yourselves as you usually do in
the comments as to who did it better
aesthetically and stop playing to
yourself Chris are you ready are you
ready Chris are you how are you feeling
are you feeling confident at all being
your made your second build or your
first and a half build maybe pretty
confident that you're just not gonna
beat me Wow let's see wow so you're like
you're kind of taking that approach
where it's like I don't need to outrun
the bear I need to outrun you pretty
much yeah lovely thanks thanks Chris
appreciate it
alright so let's actually have wifey
sauce count it down because she has a
shrill voice that's good for eating okay
all right true but you should have it on
I sure you have this on you should
already have that on okay all right put
it on get it then put it on all right
all right then I can't see without my
glasses
ow your nails dug into my forehead oh
all right okay all right let's see this
interesting I have a rise in five CPU
he's got a rise in seven I gave all the
the the better hardware to Chris because
I I'm probably gonna big Ria's better
always better Kyle I cannot see where
the arrow is on the CPU but I do know
which way it comes out of the box or
though yes I do Chris time trying to
make me doubt myself or make you think I
think I have to go you know can't wait
for you that's not part of the challenge
better hope I know just like trying to
slow you down
all right better hope that oh you know
what we need we need thermal paste over
here about thermal paste all right cool
oh no I'm fine Chris and how the heck am
I supposed to figure out how much I'm
actually putting on here sure you know
how much you're putting on there I have
no idea did you even give me a tube that
has stuff in it there's a couple empty
ones in there is this supposed to come
out like no problem because I'm having
problem okay I think that's I don't want
that like over squeeze and got to fit in
and then it comes click squirting out
all right come on Heather he's already
beating me where is that this shouldn't
be happening yep that's right
take that hey wait coolers going in baby
it's like one of those like things where
you can't point the gun at your face but
you know like wait I have no choice this
is this is not the right cooler you gave
me the wrong cooler this is an Intel
stock cooler
this isn't Intel you can't fool me
all right I'm a professional is that an
Intel stock cooler less where's my damn
rate give me the damn rate the right
business
this is tomfoolery come out you have to
find it are you
I can't wait is this no no that's that's
your that's mine this is a power supply
where did you put the damn thing they're
like these if this is really difficult
it's like an Olympic sport to get this
out or these are all empty no wait this
is the stupid Intel one crap
are these all cats though if these are
oh wait where's the freaking are you
sure it's on here yes
liar
this one's still higher no okay you guys
I hate you okay where the hell okay now
that we're past that
finally it's kind of a turn and I'm
gonna assume this goes on like that
you sure about that guy yes I am Chris
no idea yes that's the sound I like to
hear
oh my god oh wow he's having a real
tough time with that oh you know what oh
that's 13 Oh
ha ha ha ha I was holding the
motherboard the wrong way that makes a
lot of sense so assuming that that's the
fan come hotter
it's a CPU fan right here actually where
is it or is it no I'm gonna assume that
that's not the one because there's two
one label that says if you opt opt then
there's a second one to the right those
CPUs bad so you're only gonna assume
that has to be you know that that means
something so by the order of deduction
I'm gonna replug that so that should be
good on to the next item which is going
into the case I'm not mistaken okay I
don't know how this comes out happening
oh okay that that comes off rather
terrifyingly standoffs
look good am I forgetting something oh
you're helping him now awesome yeah help
the guy who can see I am forgetting
something wow thanks Heather
Wow so you you hand me a completely
incorrect part and he gets verbal cues
okay
cooler installed
which of these should be right don't
don't do this another you're doing
something wrong and I could tell not
really I mean there's only one way to
photo shoot like this out don't laugh
for no reason
yeah so then why you said making me
second - that's so mean Heather why
would you do such a thing go honey
make him smeared how is wrong it isn't
gone this way that would make zero sense
zero you're messing with my mind here
stop messing with my mind first damn
notch the storage Wow let's just make a
bet right now if you if I beat you cow
does that mean that you're buying drinks
tonight
no you're buying the beers you have to
put this on first like that wait I think
that's what I have to do right here the
notch in the DVR for games is much much
more centered than you should leave area
for are you serious no you would pay
that based there I'm doing
lefty-loosey righty-tighty see I like I
kind of knew this was gonna happen like
I can take a break I could yeah I swear
to god Chris never talking to you again
after this this is so much harder than
him than it looks
I didn't think it was gonna be this bad
oh no I mean he's got completely
struggling oh yeah I am full throttle I
have no idea this is worse than the tank
build this is the real man versus build
challenge right here that was gonna be
the easiest part
it is so not easy Oh sweating oh I can't
do it man keep going keep going
I I think I've given up I honestly I
don't think that I can do this
here right there there's like an actual
strategy we've got this down we as we
did that let's let's let's let we're
gonna do the PSU I wasn't really I will
get one of these sticks installed ah
it just needs the boot Kyle just need
some boot cuz have to look pretty
he's mean 6to4 I did one in three
I know they don't poop but I don't know
if that's the proper way to do it I just
you missed it
okie dokie I'm gonna try an attempt to
do the PS you know I'm gonna take off
the back end struggle is real oh no idea
man I can't like having a fun Kyle
having fun I'm gonna have to move on we
have to move on without it it'll still
boot all right so it's still technically
my only day he'll technically find it
already was better but oh well just you
wait
it's not over yet this alright just hard
let's come up push em pool got aa dokie
yield all right Wow okay we have I don't
know what this is I have a shield that's
interesting something else in the way no
since I know he's not gonna get
something other things and quite as fast
I'm gonna pick some time some cable
manager here okie dokie so now that I
know what I'm doing kind of I'm gonna do
this front panel I oh I know he's not
gonna do that
you don't know anything I am so in the
dark right now this is my advice I don't
know where any of these go like where
did
okay I'm going to attempt screwing in I
know what this goes you're 40 I think we
have one too I don't think it's this bag
I cannot tell if this is it this isn't
much of a speed build
I can considering a very very slow build
what do you expect
I'm doing things out that's supposed to
be facing up right I'm gonna sue muse
wouldn't you like to know Chris I'm
gonna assume no if it if it cooks it so
it cooks itself I know I do
having fun Kyle no he's not reading what
is this nonsense
anything that's tiny that's tight
muahaha should have known like just
screwing things in would be the most
difficult part of this whole thing so
you're saying you're having trouble
screwing more than usual stop being so
finicky no aha
success that's the difference is that
you keep succeeding and I think is this
oh I don't think I'll ever install this
power supply this is why are they
clicking ah all right time to put things
in what's what sense is there to make a
grommet that won't fit a freaking a pin
cable through
these guys out grabbed our handy-dandy
this is not the right card it is no it's
not give me the right card
that's all record I hate you I hate you
guys so much indeed Kyle indeed is a
graphics card oh now he built alright
cuz he's catching actually catching up
to have to put this down here I do kind
of but not really here's all this cable
Spokane I literally have had to take off
every one of these expansion flaws
because I don't know which one this goes
in haha
success because I have to eight pins
could I use the better graphics card I'm
gonna one-up Kyle right now I got time
plenty of time I swear like I've lost
some of the cables there's some cable
are you doing okay already my builds
like 10 times better than pens graphics
card are you almost done
nope take your time
it's real oh I need a drive why haven't
I done that drive game going for front
panel connectors I don't know what I'm
doing
happy I don't I doesn't know what is I
am doing I apparently can't do anything
anymore
what ah apparently it looks like there's
no back plate that's removable from here
so in order to get this mounted to the
case I had to have screwed it in before
I mounted the motherboard otherwise I
have no accidents so this is just gonna
you know chill right there for now
it is impossible no definitely not
you must since where's the other panel
no where's the other panel by the leg
behind me yeah well I got this one on do
we have to boot it on
get in there okay wage is the wrong side
not trying to break this I'm done I'm
done
I saw my sheet okay so the dust has
settled a little bit since since we
finished the speed belt and we more or
less finished around the same time you
obviously took a lot more time with
cable management and aesthetics because
you had the luxury of not being
blindfolded but that doesn't mean we're
not gonna critique your build and and
what you have going on here so this is
Chris's build that we're inspecting
first go ahead and pop the side panel
off for me sir oh just let me make a
disclaimer oh there's a disc clip
interesting that guy you can see how's
it been fair if you hear anything is bad
or off or wrong I've only been trained
by bit with so Wow Wow I have never
properly trained him on how to build a
PC I will make a disclaimer disclaimer
at any rate I guess we'll let you guys
decide what you think of Chris's system
here so let's go ahead and pop this guy
off sure thing if you remember head up
on the side panel okay if I taught you
well enough a little shaky there little
shaky so okay first off this is not even
the GPU that we started with you had a
gtx 1070 founders edition now we have an
RX
what 485 80 in here how did that happen
I know that music I know this was the
card that you guys pranked me with
initially but then now you have it what
what happened there walk meet what
helped me understand so what happened
was it was basically just chillin there
I was like well if an Rx would've 580 s
just chillin there I might as well use
it right yeah I mean yeah you cost
yourself an additional time you had to
plug in a whole other PCIe connector you
know yeah you're very very bold of you
and the other the other thing that I
should say is that why is it in this Y
is your GPU installed into this slot you
know I don't know I kind of I try to put
it here just really hastily and it sort
of reason I was getting clearance issues
that
think with this this Ram this memory
right now that I don't buy that for a
second but again it was very rushed at
the time oh and first he's first they're
taking your time now your rush right oh
he's here story a rough placement and it
seemed like it was fitting so I didn't
want to force things so I just you know
interesting also we have an SSD that's
just kind of floating here I realized
that I could not sue this thing because
there is no separable tray from the back
is there no trade in the back no doesn't
look like there's a tray
okay fine to be fair I did mount this
cooler pointed to the right that is
irrelevant
the cooler can be mounted either way
there's no right or wrong side that the
AMD logo on the race should go oh how
come how come nothing don't pay
attention how come you
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa this we have an
upset folks why are your front panel
connectors not connected does the new
front panel connector does does it need
four no Chris it doesn't need to be able
to be turned on by the power button on
the case we may have an incomplete
system on our hands I'll say this I'll
still allow you to attempt booting by
shorting the the pins with a screwdriver
and I guess means and I guess we'll see
I'm sure you wouldn't you knew but
goodness Chris Chris alright well you
know what at least at least you know
your drive look like looks like it's
connected okay the backside I mean you
you you definitely took some time with
cable management here okay Chris you
know what it's it's not a bad build it's
not a bad build especially if we can
actually get it off the floor and boot
it but before we do that let's take a
look at my rig so this is functional
highly functional I I will guarantee you
that this will boot okay aesthetics
aside we did clarify up front the
beginning of this video the cable
management and aesthetics was not a
factor in determining the winner speed
was speed and speed alone and since we
both finished pretty much the exact same
time it's gonna boil down to who
boots and if they both boot then I guess
it comes down to aesthetics but that's
the only use that as the tiebreaker okay
assuming that there's gonna be a draw
here so I can I can this is actually
believe or not the first time I'm
actually seeing my finished system we've
got a missing Ram stick for starters I
could not for the life of me get that
stick in that second Slough for whatever
reason the first one was easy because it
was a slot closest to me was easier to
feel around but I just kept I just kept
my alignment was completely off in my
head and so I just continued on with the
rest of the build my front panel
connectors you can see are plugged in
will actually have power a power button
that we can use I think that's that's
pretty key for for most computers these
days my SSD like Chris's
is plugged in but not mounted properly
so I guess I guess in that sense I can
sort of empathize with where you work my
GPU is both the GPU that we were
supposed to use and it's in the proper
by 16 PCIe slot which means we'll get
full 16 PCIe lanes so once we boot it up
at any rate both of these systems have
their fair share of shortcomings I think
it's safe to say so at this point I
think we can try to see if they boot
okay it's time to try booting Chris's PC
first since he has not wired up his
front panel connectors we are gonna
short the pins with our handy dandy
screwdriver here you know it's kind of
even hard to short this because your
video cards mounted so low can't see
shit good lord man freaking okay haha
powered on fans are spinning HDMI one
and we have a successful boot in your
buy this by the skin of your teeth Chris
by the skin of your teeth teeth don't
have skin Kyle it's a figure of speech
Chris okay fine
good job pads on the back and all that
let's see if mine boots
all right well it's plugged in let's use
the power button on the
case to turn it on if it works and it
does Oh a fan spinning on the CPU cooler
I'm not saying anything Kyle just give
it a second there we go there we go
people so both of our systems had a
successful boot
hi-five Chris well despite both of our
systems booting successfully I still
have to give the victory to you Chris
just just because it does your system
does look a lot nicer all things
considered I did say that
aesthetics would be the tiebreaker and
since both of our systems were equally
awesome congratulations sir you you beat
the master but guys if you think that
this is still open for debate
go ahead and leave your own feedback in
the comments below and I'll be sure to
check them out guys thank you so much
for watching be sure to LIKE the video
if you enjoyed this fun little thing we
just did and feel free to check us out
on floatplane if you want to watch
videos like this up to a week early
without ads link in the description
below till next time guys have a good
one and we will see y'all in the next
video
alright so I'm trying to take my job now
all right you just cuz you beat me here
doesn't mean you're all of a sudden
Tecton verse 11 Oh call me bit with Kyle
yeah I'm sick Bishop I'm out of here
well call me bit wit Kyle with his
glasses
