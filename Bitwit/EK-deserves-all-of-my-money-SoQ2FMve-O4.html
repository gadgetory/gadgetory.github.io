Bertha ek booth and my god look at this
look at this guy this is an in win 909
heavily heavily modified by one of their
one of the reps Joe he did a fantastic
job absolutely beautiful this thing's
blowing my mind
it's actually been modified to the point
where that he actually widened it so he
could cram more goodness into it look at
this distro Block in the back
acrylic distro block that spans the
entire I mean it basically is the entire
motherboard tray totally nuts of course
using lovely ek hardware you can also
see that we have dual for ATS there's a
480 here and a 480 on the other side
both mounted simultaneously there's also
dual D 5 pumps the best best on the
market just below here
those are running in serial got the GPUs
running in parallel these brand new very
precisely machined fittings look really
cool if my camera focus boom and I also
like the little color ring you see it it
looks like the the tubing goes through
and you can see the tubing through it
that's actually a colored ring that's
gonna be customizable you can choose
between a variety of different colors
it's a very small detail but it kind of
makes a huge difference when you know
you've got him throughout your entire
system if you're really trying to go for
that custom look I should also mention
that they're considering bringing this
to market so that people can actually
buy this they're still deciding on what
kind of setup it's gonna come with if
they're gonna include the water blocks
or the radiators the distro blocks and
so forth but I hope it does come to
market so that we can see more custom
builds inside of this beautiful case
moving on here we have the quantum line
the quantum line is they're sort of
top-of-the-line premium family of
products so you've got everything from
monoblocks
CPU water blocks GPU blocks pump brass
for us this design so you've got that
same custom color ring option at the top
3-year reservoir tube and then kind of a
see-through option here pump in action
additionally we've got some very
nice-looking blocks here this is a
vector Strix model as you can see I
believe they're still gonna have the s
key and P offerings for the radiators
depending on if you need thinner or
thicker ed rads we also have their
classic line which is they're a bit more
entry-level or I should say more
affordable range of custom liquid
cooling Guard wear but what I've been
told is that there are not really
skimping on the actual quality or the
cooling performance here but more so
just attention to detail lights just
went out that's necessarily fine who
needs RGB anyway they're really just
changing the machining process to be a
bit cheaper and more affordable so piece
of the the cooling difference for the
GPU block for example is within margin
of error it's it's a negligible
difference which is actually really
exciting if you don't have the
additional coin to get into high-end
liquid cooling this definitely gets your
foot in the door a lot faster and the
block still look very nice I mean as a
supremacy look here you can tell that
there's some my new differences in the
design compared to the quantum but still
very very nice I love a look at these
radiators and then we have lignum lignum
is their wood series which is going to
be definitely more expensive just
because of the ridiculous craftsmanship
that's gone into making these blocks
this is pure solid walnut this is
genuine wood this is not faux wood this
is the real deal people see if you
blocks fittings the fittings just
everything feels fantastic and this GPU
block together inside of the build such
as this one I just looks absolutely
phenomenal
if you're trying to go for more of a
more modern look I don't I don't know
what you've got organic it's definitely
an organic look no word on pricing I
just know it's gonna be a bit more than
you've come to expect from good ol ek
these are the new magnitude blocks these
are a bit on more high inside a
definitely high-quality and they're
gonna be shipping with those four
flavors that you just saw now eventually
they might plan to release different
colors like the ones you see here so you
can kind of customize the color and
stuff but I think the real real main
selling point here is how they've
actually done B the fin so on the copper
plate here you can see compared to like
the supremacy
and you can see the fins are much wider
a lot more surface area here the pitch
has been improved and in just the way
that the water is flowing across the
entire the entire surface is going to
lead to 80% more surface area compared
to supremacy so obviously the price is
going to be up but temperatures are
gonna be way down this is a completely
custom built by the same same person who
did the inland 9:09 that we just showed
and it's really kind of ingenious how
they did this so if you kind of look
here it's for starters very reflective
and an absolutely gorgeous machining but
you can see that as monoblock is just
one two and then the GPUs which are in
SLI and be linked also just one tube so
how does this all work I was kind of
scratching my head for a while until the
guy explained it so you've actually got
water coming into here and then from
there it sort of splits it kind of goes
you know half of it goes to this this
top card the other half goes to the
bottom card permeates those two blocks
and then it goes back into the card
where it it actually makes its way down
to the vrm and cpu block because they're
connected as one thing I missed they're
actually connected here so the water
then goes here and then it finally goes
back in here where it gets circulated
through the pump and reservoir radiator
and then and that's pretty much the loop
so this is just conceptual this is just
a passion project and showing kind of
what's possible in the future for custom
water coins so if you're into the
enterprise sector then you might be
interested in something like this
assuming you have a bajillion dollars we
have like what is one two three four
five six seven Quadro cards and kind of
a very nice organic look here look at
all that tubing just laid out into this
manifold all goes into this manifold
this is all custom-built and they're
gonna be a custom building all of these
depending on their client's needs these
are all tailor-made to the client these
are all quick-disconnect supported so if
you need to swap out one of these cards
you can easily do that a lot of
enterprise clients might not need seven
Quadro cards at first or maybe they
don't have the coin for that so they
start off in a few and they can easily
add in more down the line with those
quick disconnects additionally it makes
troubleshooting a lot easier because you
know one of these cards goes down you
pretty much remove one in a matter of
seconds and continue using the system
effectively as we all know an enterprise
downtime is the double you're
hemorrhaging money at that point so
anything you can do to make that process
a lot simpler is pretty pretty crucial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
