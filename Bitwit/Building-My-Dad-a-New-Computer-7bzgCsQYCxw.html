handman tonight I mean obviously the
movies gonna butcher the original
storyline but come on he's like the most
underrated character in the Marvel
Universe screw Ant Man man let's go to
Vegas the venturi fans from fractal
design make everything cooler that's
right even you check the link in the
description boy what's up guys welcome
back to the channel so today I've got
another vlog for you guys but it's not
going to be focused on my custom
water-cooled PC instead I'm going to be
building another computer from scratch
from the ground up for someone else and
this person would be my beloved father
who he works from home he's
self-employed and he relies heavily on
his desktop PC for for all of his work
and multitasking needs of course but
lately it's been having a lot of issues
and crashing frequently shut up bone and
he's really at the end of his rope in
terms of being able to work efficiently
and get his work done in a timely manner
so that being said I've decided to build
him a full new computer from the ground
up and he doesn't know about it yet this
is a complete secret so hush-hush don't
don't tell him I know you have complete
access to to getting in contact with him
but yeah I'm gonna be building him kind
of a workstation he doesn't I kill ya
the main purpose of the PC is
essentially a simple workstation that he
can do some light gaming on it if he so
chooses he's not a huge gamer he plays a
really basic like almost 8-bit type game
so he doesn't really need that much
horsepower which is fine because uh
basically all the parts that I'm using
today with the exception of one I
believe are just parts that I have lying
around my house that have just been
collecting dust and need to find a good
home so why don't we take a look at that
right now here's a couple of the parts
and you can see no retail boxes in sight
because a lot of them are reused let's
start with the motherboard and CPU so
this is actually taken from Heather's
old system that I built her for Chris
a couple years back but it's still a
really good hardware it's Ivybridge so
we've got a z77 n Wi-Fi board from
gigabyte so it does have a built in
Wi-Fi which is nice and you can't really
see the CPU because the CPU coolers
already installed on there I didn't
really see a point to take it off but
that's a core i3 I forget the exact
model number it escapes me at the moment
it could be a 32 25 or something like
that but we'll find out when we boot the
system on so that should be pretty good
for as multitasking needs we've also got
the this memory kit from g.skill this is
their sniper series really good stuff
super reliable
this is 1333 megahertz and is 8
gigabytes so you get to-four gig sticks
which would be more than enough for my
dad and then also like I said he might
be doing some lighter gaming maybe he'll
get more into it now that he's got a
badass system so for the for those
purposes he's got a GTX 650 Ti boost I
remember this card is more akin to a 660
that it is a 650 Ti so it definitely
still packs a punch
obviously it's a lower-end card nowadays
but should still be quite enough for for
my dad and last but not least we've got
the node 202 now this is probably the
newest freshest component in this entire
system and it's also probably the most
important apart from it already having a
the pre-installed 450 watt 80 plus
certified power supply in here which is
SFX this is really important to have a
case like this for my dad because he's
really limited on space he does have a
pretty large desk it's actually much
bigger than mine but he needs that space
to be utilized for other things like
paperwork and his monitors and stuff
like that so he's got a little cubby
hole and in the underneath his desk that
he's currently keeping his main system
and so this is going to slot inside of
that and the cubby isn't really that big
so he's going to need a really slim form
factor case and I think the note 202 is
going to do a fine job because even in
the Indian clothes cubby space you've
got a lot of open ventilation for your
video card your motherboard area and
stuff like that so I think he's going to
be pretty happy with this situation
overall but wait Kyle where's the
where's the storage what what is he
going to save all of his precious files
on and stuff what is where's the OS
going well I'm glad you asked that
that's actually the one item that I have
still waiting for me at nuke new eggs
will call I just ordered it this morning
it's the WD black squared it's their
dual hybrid drive I shouldn't
hybrid but it's a dual Drive in a small
2.5 inch form factor which includes a
120 gig SSD as well as a one terabyte
hard drive he is going to be using an
external drive he told me this
personally he's going to be using an
external drive to store his backups and
things like that he opted for that
instead of a raid solution which is
totally fine so I'm gonna have to be
picking that drive up later today and
putting it in here before I hand it off
to him and blow his mind but that being
said I'm not gonna wait until I have
that drive I'm just gonna start building
because I can get 90% of this stuff in
here before actually hooking up any any
storage devices so why don't we put this
thing together and make some people
happy or just just one person but still
let's it'll be fun
you
all right so I reached a pretty good
stopping point here and this is pretty
much as far as I can go until I get that
two and a half inch drive and I can
install it in this little compartment
right down here there are some tie-down
points on either side so I'm not gonna
be able to really tidy up the cable
management until that drives installed
but for the meantime here's a look at
everything else sitting pretty I've got
the video card in there even though I'm
gonna have to take this out eventually
when I install the drive just because
it's a little bit in the way and I'm
gonna have to route some cables and do
some more management there but overall
pretty smooth builds the reason why I
opted for AWD black squared I've never
used one before this is the first
situation where I was like this drive
makes sense
and that's because even though you do
have two two slots for two and a half
inch drives in this No - OH - I just
wanted to minimize the number of cables
that I had to use so I could just tuck
them away here and just kind of you know
reduce the amount of cable clutter
overall in the build so I think that's
going to work out nicely only having one
SATA one SATA cable for data and power
and also this doesn't support this case
doesn't support three and a half inch
drives so obviously a two and a half
inch drive was the only solution and
yeah I think it's going to work out
pretty well as soon as I have that
install going to be installing Windows
8.1 on here and then I think my dad's
planning on upgrading to Windows 10 very
soon after that apart from that the
cable management in here so far is
looking pretty good obviously it's
really tight you can see up here I've
just got barely enough clearance for the
side panel to go on for the rest of the
enclosure and it's just kind of like
really just cramming in here between the
power supply and the the RAM modules but
it is enough room it's very tight but
that's you know one of the sacrifices
you make when building this small
form-factor case like this one but
overall pretty sweet I think it's time
for a test boot unless there's anything
else that I have to say about this thing
other than that's oh yeah I did want to
mention that the the RAM modules even
though the sniper series does have some
fairly tall heat spreaders it's not
low-profile back by any means it still
manages to fit in here quite nicely I
will say you do need a low profile CPU
cooler and you can see here I'm just as
I said in the beginning of the video I'm
opting for the Intel stock cooler right
there it should be quite enough like I
said it's going to be underneath my
dad's desk that's where he wants to put
it I know it's his decision I know not
all of you are a fan of that fan but I
think this is going to be fine so I'm
gonna be too close to him or if
very audible so I don't think it'll be
too distracting for him and some of you
might might already know this but might
be wondering how did I get this video
card installed here when the the PCI
slot is clearly right here on the
motherboard that's basically a little
riser card that frankly uses and
actually use two riser cards so there's
one that's sticking vertically or
perpendicular to the motherboard right
here and then you've got a second one
that goes parallel to the motherboard
that connects to that first one and then
that's when you install the video card
itself pretty tricky and very clever
innovative solution that works really
nicely alright enough of my rambling I'm
gonna turn this thing on let's do a test
boot obviously we don't need the any any
storage drives for that so let's see how
it goes blah LED I got the LED light
that's always good
CPU cooler fan is good and I guess the
only other indication for power here
would be the GPU but of course we're
gonna have to go to the other side to
see that blower style fan hopefully it's
all good ok it's actually impossible to
see through this this dust filter here
but I can barely hear it it's very
slightly audible but I can tell that it
is on I can feel some of the cool breeze
being sucked off in my hand exhaust my
hand my hands hot yeah dissipate that
 yeah alright so I think this is a
ok to say we've got a successful boot
here I'm really excited to finishing
this thing off with that two and a half
inch drive getting Windows 8.1 installed
and then finally doing the long-awaited
surprise drop-off should be good alright
so it has been about an hour and a half
since the last clip that you just saw in
this video and I still have yet to
receive my confirmation email from
Newegg notifying me that the hard drive
that I ordered this morning is ready for
pickup so I mean at this point I'm
pretty much stuck I'm just playing the
waiting game until I get that email and
as soon as I do I'm going to haul ass
over to will call and pick it up I guess
I'm kind of just twiddling my thumb's
here until I get that email so guess I
guess I'll play some rocket League
ah ah I got the email
it says it's ready for pickup all right
let's go pick this thing up do you ever
get those deep thoughts when you're
driving in your car all alone em either
don't close don't close I made it I made
it
alright guys and here is the finished
system finally with the hard drive
installed or the the dual drive I should
say and here's a good look at the back
of the case you've already seen the
inside for the most part but it's uh up
and running got Windows 8.1 installed
I was actually incorrect about the cpu
model it's it is a core i3 but it's a
2120 so none why it is powerful as I
thought it was but it should get the job
done
you can see there we've got full eight
gigs of RAM yes everything is looking
beautiful and the happy to report that
the WD black squared drive is working
correctly so there's your 120 gig boot
drive along with that one terabyte
mechanical absolutely beautiful and I
think that pretty much wraps it up for
the build vlogedy so I think on that
note we should wrap this thing up and
surprise the crap out of my dad
alright alright moment of truth see Thea
she was reacting as I'm really curious
when he's gonna
what is response it's gonna be he can be
kind of like a stone wall sometimes like
hides his emotions pretty well but um I
think I think this will really catch him
off-guard
at least what do you think honey yeah I
think he'll be very surprised especially
because he just sent you an email today
explaining to you that he needed a new
computer and you just so happened to be
doing this oh wait I am yeah I actually
forgot to mention that to you guys so
this morning I woke up and I didn't
really have a video in mind or planned
for this weekend and I thought I'm gonna
build my dad a computer that's what I'm
gonna do today and like not more than an
hour later he emailed me completely
coincidentally and basically just listed
out all the things that he wanted in a
computer and it was like the perfect
roadmap at the perfect time for me to
actually go through with it and find him
all the parts that he needed and make
sure that he gets a system that's really
tailored for his needs so I mean just
wow I was pretty shocked and amazed that
that'll work
so well but but here we are what is this
maybe seven eight hours later after the
the seat had been planted and if you
what we're gonna go around the back
we're gonna go around the back way show
business he is coming they're sticky huh
hey mom okay is he is he in his office
all right well we're parked right around
the corner so we're just gonna walk up
and walk in okay all right thanks yeah
good I've got a special package delivery
of a new computer for a Shawn no way dad
ish thing no way yeah just kind of found
this it's a perfectly good PC it needs a
home so he built that today what now
that's for me this is for you that's
what we're talking about yes oh don't do
that keep that there you go they look
Wow hot this is just flashing my brain
can't comprehend oh and then we all went
out for milkshakes okay so that didn't
happen but it was a very fun rest of the
evening and I get to power the system on
and show it to my dad
get him familiarized with the OS we even
got to install couple applications that
he'll be using for his day-to-day work
work needs and they sure enough loaded
super fast and booted really looted up
really quick on that SSD which he was
pretty amazed by overall it was a pretty
cool experience for him I'm sure as well
as for me and hopefully for all of you
I'm sorry I couldn't get more b-roll
shots of his old system but after he's
finally done loading all of his software
and files onto his new system maybe I
can take a look at that old one crack it
open see what he was working with if you
guys are interested in
to look at his old computer leave me a
comment down below let me know so I'll
know whether or not I should do a video
on it or something like that but yeah
that's gonna do for now guys thank you
so much for staying tuned has been a
really fun stay tuned for more tech
videos coming really soon
feel free to Jesus people always
speeding around here what's going on be
sure to stay tuned for more tech videos
coming really soon toss me a like on
this video guys if you enjoyed it and
subscribe to the channel T I'm not ready
until next time I'll catch you guys in
the next video
oh it's time to some rocket League
