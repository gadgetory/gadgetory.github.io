get yours today at the awesomesauce tool
what's up guys it's time for another
computer build here on Ausmus Oz Network
welcome back to the channel today I'm
going to be building a system that's
optimized purely for silence and a
little bit fur for looks this is the
silent night belt I've already named it
I haven't even built it yet that's
called planning yeah that doesn't happen
often here on awesome sauce Network but
what we're essentially building today is
a christmas-themed computer that is is
really tailored for low noise and
optimized for silence so let's go ahead
and start off with the case shall we
since the big one out of the way first
now this is the silent base 600 from be
quiet you guys might remember my silent
base 800 review that I did way maybe
like eight eight or nine months ago it's
been a while since I reviewed that case
this is B quiets follow-up to that one
it's a little bit smaller and it's
actually it does have a lot of the same
features in a smaller footprint smaller
profile all around it is a mid tower
does have a side panel window but there
is sound dampening material on the
opposite side I should mention this case
also does come with a solid panel option
that does have that sound dampening
material on the inside so you can get
even probably better acoustics that way
but honestly I think it's going to be
pretty minimal to the naked ear as they
don't say let me go ahead and flip this
case around really quick so you can see
the front of it so on the front of the
case it's pretty minimalistic which I
actually like a lot yet two USB 3.0 at
the top there the top slash front
diagonally mounted there with the other
i/o and it's kind of like a flat matte
black which we've got brushed aluminum
finish even though it is made of plastic
and it's essentially enclosed at the
front but it's got you can see it's got
ventilation strips all running down
either side of it right there at the
front as well so you do get ventilation
you get some healthy air flow in there
but this is also going to help minimize
the acoustic levels in this case which
is one of the one of the many things
that makes it so silent you can also see
there's some fans in there comes
equipped with one rear and one front
peer wings to fan I believe they're both
120 mil and they do a really good job
I've tested
fans before personally and they're super
quiet they do a good job they move a lot
of air and those are pretty much the
only two case fans we're gonna be
dealing with so all together this should
this is a good step in the right
direction in terms of making this a
quiet little system moving on to our
motherboard of choice we've got the MSI
z170a gaming pro now obviously
motherboards don't really make noise if
they do if yours makes noise then send
it back or get a new one it's that's not
supposed to happen so it really didn't
matter too much on the acoustics front
which month motherboard we went with but
I happen to pick the z170a gaming pro
just because it's a newish a newish
board it's on the new z1 78 chipset as
you can see we're going skylake now this
is slightly cheaper than the z170a
gaming m5 which is also from MSI but it
packs a lot of the same features you get
crossfire and SLI support and it's got
an m2 slot I believe you lose one turbo
m2 slot from this board but most of us
are only going to use one if any anyway
and you've also got a really nice you
know keeping with that black and red
theme so you can see we're going with
that Christmas direction so far but we
also have this weird yellow strip which
at first you're like oh that this is
really matched and that kinda looks a
little awkward next to the red but it's
actually there's RG B's in the PCB here
RGB LEDs which you can configure to
pretty much live up any color you want
as the RGB spectrum usually offers so
you can see here it's it's blue on the
back here so I can only assume that that
this can really be any color we want
whether it's red or green to match our
Christmas theme and obviously like I
said this should be quiet in the system
moving on to our I should guess I guess
I should move on to this guy next this
is a 6600 K Core i5 skylake yeah you're
old news by now buddy now this is a
really good chip for as you can see this
is a gaming system I should probably
mention that at the beginning of the
video this is a mid-range gaming system
but quite a capable little system that's
going to be a nice little overclocked
chip overclockable chip that we can use
I should say and then we've also got 16
gigs of DDR 4 memory this is the trade
NZ I did a brief a really brief video a
couple weeks back on this this
particular kit it is from g-scale see
what speed it is I can't remember
exactly what the speed is 3000 3000 mega
transfers per second which is
is pretty pretty stinking fast even for
ddr4 standard so beautiful sticks this
is honestly pretty overkill for a system
like this these are not the cheapest
sticks in the world you could definitely
go for something a little bit more
budget oriented but at the same time
they do match the motherboard quite
nicely and I just happen to have them on
hand so they're getting put into this
into this rig here next up we've got
this power supply from enter max now
they are known for having some of the
best fanless power supplies around this
is their digi fanless 550 watt which is
going to be more than enough to drive
our video card more on that later this
is a fan 'less unit and it's it's
completely silent doesn't make any noise
just relies on heat sinks and other
other kind of fancy technology that
enter max is probably patented to really
keep thermals down to a minimum but most
importantly acoustics and this is this
also does come with really cool really
cool monitoring software forget what
it's called but that's supposed to just
be for monitoring real-time current
output as well as voltages temperatures
things like that and you can also
configure a lot of that stuff as well in
the program so really cool stuff there
also it comes with fully sleeved black
cables which is a nice addition
especially if you're going to be rocking
a side panel window in your case and you
don't want any ketchup and mustard
business going on there we talked a lot
about that on pin my PC so overall this
is a really cool unit I've never built
with one of these before but I've seen
them in tons of builds in it at trade
shows and things like that so I'm really
excited to use it so moving on to our
video card of choice again going with
msi this just seemed to make sense for
me because we've got you know EMA
sideboard all red and black and they
make some really nice-looking red and
black video cards as well so we've got
their gaming 4g gtx 960 4G meaning the
four gigs of gddr5 that's right this is
a thorough C Edition PCIe three of
course so this is a really sweet card
and also like many gtx 960 s they do
allow the fans to ramp down to zero rpm
anytime the cards at idle so again
looking for that optimization in
acoustics here this is going to be a
really nice card and you'll you'll get
to see it a bit more once we start the
build itself and then let's go ahead and
move on to our drives now you can see
I've got two SSDs here the Plextor m5
Pro which is a great Drive I've used
this for years so this is an older Drive
these are both you know kind of they've
been in my inventory for
a while I'm just happening to use them
here and then the the a data s X 900 512
gig they say that this was 256 gig I
don't know if I mentioned that but both
say two three drives I used this in my
last system the black and red xi9 build
before hot line back there I use this as
my scratch disk for editing it was
fantastic like I said I've had a lot of
this has gotten a lot of use as well but
you can see no mechanical hard drives
here so again where we're going with a
non-moving solution for our storage and
this is going to be again completely
silent so I'm really happy to be
installing these two guys and finally
we've got this little beauty here from
thermal right it's they're macho zero
now this might not be a very popular
cooler but it has gotten a lot of rave
reviews from folks like a man Tech and
Tom's hardware and things like that but
this is a passive cool you can see
there's no fan here semi passive I
should say so it doesn't come with a fan
it's completely passive but it says semi
passive so essentially what they're
referring to there is this this
essentially relies on the airflow going
on within your case so case airflow the
fins are actually separated a bit wider
to it so to prevent less airflow
impedance so that way the the airflow
that's naturally flowing throughout your
case if you've built it properly and you
actually do have you know positive air
pressure and good air flow going through
it will actually dissipate the heat
effectively through the fin stack that
we have here it's a massive cooler it's
not for the faint of heart but it is
going to be 100% silent because there is
no fan it's just the body itself of the
heatsink so also first time building
with this guy curious to see what the
thermal temperatures will be the the
performance and we are going to be
installing Windows 8.1 on this guy so
I'm going to be doing some testing as
well as you know testing for like
acoustics and temperatures and and
whatnot so wow I've rambled on for way
too long looking at this recording here
so I'm gonna shut up I'm so sorry I
almost forgot something
I forgot this little guy here this is
really what makes the Christmas magic
y'all this is a green LED strip this is
one of the alchemy 2.0 magnetic strips
from BitFenix these are super handy
especially in the case like this made of
steel where you can actually stick the
the magnets will work and whatnot so
yeah it's not going to be really
Christmasy if it's just read and maybe a
little strip of green here on the edge
of the motherboard so we're going to amp
it up a little bit more get into the
Christmas spirit y'all with a little bit
more festivity with with the help of
this green LED so that's pretty much it
let's build this thing
you
you
all right you crazy party animals the
build is complete yeah it's Christmassy
it's pretty Christmasy granted the the
green on the led oh by the way I'm
wearing one of the gloves that came with
my CPU cooler the macho zero also came
with this awesome screwdriver I posted
this on Instagram thermal right you guys
are the best magnetic tip a super long
hey I love it love it and I don't know
why I'm wearing the glove still now I'm
only wearing one saying so I'm kind of
doing a Michael Jackson here and these
are small gloves though I will admit but
um damn this is a pretty sex build it's
very uh themed thematic I should say the
red and green is playing quite nice like
I said the green washes out the red on
the motherboard a little bit but really
it's the the heat sinks on the
motherboard the vrm heat sinks are
completely covered by that massive CPU
cooler they're not that I'm complaining
but it does cover up some of the red on
the board that you would otherwise see
far from that the video card looks
fantastic in here hey good job in maasai
and even the little blinky lights that I
thought might have looked a little bit
tacky are are tastefully placed and
they're not going berserk or whatever
you might be able to configure the
pattern I know you can definitely change
the color but you might be able to
change like you know maybe one solid
strip of red maybe had the whole thing
breathe I'm not sure I'm gonna have two
gloves freaking me out isn't it but
again about this power supply I really
wanted to point out this is 80 plus
platinum I didn't mention that before
look at how beautiful these these sleept
cables are that come with the power
supply I just yeah that's how they
should all be but really the main
attraction here is there's absolutely no
noise coming from it as well as that CPU
cooler both dead silent and just here
just here I'll put I'll put the camera
inside of the computer you gonna get a
weird perspective here but just just
listen the camera is literally inside
its resting on the video card right now
just just go ahead and listen to how
loud it is in there
you can hear anything maybe probably not
maybe but I literally cannot hear
anything from where I'm sitting right
now granted the system is idling so stay
tuned for part two where I actually put
a load on this guy and see how loud it
gets with those GPU fans ramping up as
well as the case fans but for the most
part this is pretty damn I mean the
building
named silent night it definitely wears
it well because this thing is frickin
silent it doesn't make a peep at least
for now so stay tuned for part two I
don't know if I'm gonna run any
benchmarks yet maybe just do thermals
and acoustics that's really what this is
all about but another few points that I
wanted to make about the system you can
see that the CPU cooler is kind of
mounted to the side that's just the
design I could have flipped it but then
I would have covered those beautiful
sticks right there and I kind of wanted
to show those off but here look at this
the fan is super close I almost ran out
of clearance here with the CPU cooler
and the rear exhaust case fan here
because there's just a couple
millimeters in between but it actually
kind of works out nicely because you are
getting some coverage of airflow of a
pull you're getting some pull airflow
coming through this the spin stack right
here from that exhaust and that's that's
kind of nice even though it's not fully
there it is about more than half way
covered so I wasn't really expecting
that when I was going into the build
apart from that I am I don't know what
to say this this build rocks and you
should like this video if you enjoyed it
and let me know what your expectations
are for for part two in this video when
I do some testing now that's going to
pretty much do it for now guys thank you
all so much for watching stay tuned for
more tech videos coming really soon
sorry it's really bright I'll try to
turn that down in post and I'm gonna go
get this glove off now but hopefully you
guys enjoy the rest of your day and week
and month and the rest of your life and
weekend deep now that's all for now guys
see y'all in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
