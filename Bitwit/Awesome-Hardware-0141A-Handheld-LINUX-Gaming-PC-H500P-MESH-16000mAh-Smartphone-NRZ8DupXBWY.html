hardware episode 141 side hey this is a
live show the pole and I like to do
every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time right here on twitch TV
slash awesome hardware we also like to
split it up into two halves on YouTube
so this week the first half is on my
channel because I actually did a little
switcheroo this week I was supposedly we
were supposed to be at my place but
things happen and so we're at Paul's
place again two weeks in a row well
that's cool so after about an hour or so
we're gonna switch gears and go to
Paul's channel if you're watching this
on YouTube I'll put a link to that in
the video description below or you can
go to youtube to accomplish Paul's
Hardware when this half is over also
this is a show where we don't only just
talk about tech news and stuff but we'd
like to have a few drinks so if you are
of legal drinking age feel free to drink
along with us it makes us more
interesting and we also sometimes swear
we also have potty mouths when things
get crazy and you know it's always
warranted let's all language that
language warning but if you have little
ones in the room please hide them you
know this is I'm drinking miso honey
blonde from belching beaver brewery I
see what they got there which also kind
of sounds like miso like miso soup so it
sounds very unappetizing Sarah honey
yeah me and so cool I'm thinkin the same
thing for now we'll be spitting through
different beers throughout the quarter
nice choose to all of you thanks for
joining welcome everyone mmm we also
sell stuff we have stores it's it's part
of what we do to make a living so if
you'd like to support us there and also
got some cool merch nicely change you
can get a bit with text slash store
where I'm now selling hoodies with the
zipper hoodie zipper hoodie yes zipper
hoodie with it this is silver metallic
logo there very nice just got a sample
of it super super comfy and very
affordable
is this a lightweight one it's a lighter
weight one yes yeah if you happen to be
in like you know somewhere where it's
not definitely cold all the time I know
it's it's definitely where we're at but
that might be a good option 34 bucks I
think that pretty good desk mats are
doing really well look it out anything
for the females you got a bit matured
for the girls and a bunch of us also
available in black yep
several new items on both of our stories
Paul's is Paul Spartanburg Harbor that
net for my store a new in particular
Philips new yes so the the metallic
silver I've just tried this it's it's a
little ostentatious not gonna lie it's
your little people go look at that and
be like wow he's probably kind of full
of him what I do but I it on and I was
kind of I kind of liked it so no it's
it's very subtle it's not like it's not
like it's like huge yeah some like
sequins or some shit is very subtle
I've worried in the video I got that
shit that I'm gonna post tomorrow so
also the likes like a beam of light from
your chest also I also got the
lightweight hoodies over there check
that out stuff two mugs pint glasses
it's all real high quality stuff things
to anyone who buys and stuff and
supports us yeah and we'll shout out
your name at the end of each half along
with the Johnson it's tradition yep that
is what we're working with for today
we can go ahead and dive into the news
that's your half the docks all switched
around today yeah we flipped it alright
so flipped it I'm starting off with hot
and heavy hardware oh yeah
which is also gonna serve as my
techniques for the day because there
weren't a ton of really interesting
articles to be honest and we'll talk
about some of that interesting stuff on
Paul's half basically he's to all the
good stories so but but there's a lot of
good hardware that's coming out soon or
has already launched this week so let's
talk about cuz I thought it was gonna be
first I wanted to like you know I know
how it goes we changed the format oh
yeah we just pure chaos
I need some order inside that well well
plow through yeah so first up we have
this article from Lillet pooting which
is about the smack Z I have no idea if
I'm pronouncing this right it's either
smock or smach I'm gonna say smock smack
smack smack smack see it's a portable
Linux gaming PC so imagine like you know
Nintendo DS or I guess it would be
closer to the the GPD
win is it is that the name of it what GP
GP thingy the windows one what's it
called the one that we talked about like
a week or so ago
maybe PD remember what we talked about
no I know I don't remember even my own
articles GPD win - was the handheld
Windows gaming device for triple-a
gaming oh yeah ok so this is sort of
like I do kinda remember this I guess
the competitor to that this one's
apparently gonna be a bit faster so
you'll have higher performance here
because it's being powered by a V 1000
series AMD Rison APU specifically the
model number is the v1 6:05 B which
we're all super familiar with and know
the exact specs on that but it is gonna
have four CPU cores eight threads two
gigahertz base clock see on the job you
know 3.6 gigahertz boost it's actually
not bad and it is gonna be rockin Vega 8
graphics you'll have eight GPU cores
exactly sure what the clock speed on
that would be yeah you can do any other
coffee but this is gonna be a full Linux
based system in the palm of your hands
today do you think probably not it's
probably false - I just want to stop
them
I mean you block you want to I can if I
may down the 40 make it moved right now
I could lock the Mets kill hero before
he kills you
so it also features a 6 6 inch full HD
display don't know exactly the
technology behind that panel or the
refresh rate
I would imagine 60 Hertz I don't
obviously don't have any like adaptive
vsync or adaptive refresh rate there
it's it's also coming in two different
models you can get the pro version with
eight gigs of DDR for 2100 2133 and a
128 gig SSD or you can get the basic
model with 4 gigs of ram and 64 gigs of
storage both of those memory and storage
are both expandable regardless of which
option you get you can go up to 16 gigs
they take som so laptop memory and up to
256 gigs of nand flash storage that's
pretty cool
this was a very successful it started
off as a very successful Kickstarter
campaign in 2016 so it's been you know
yes a couple years now so a lot of
people were wondering
if this was a scam if it was actually
too too good to be true if there was any
real plans for the the campaign managers
of this project to follow through and
they just uploaded these pictures of
hardware so they're definitely working
on the hardware and they revealed a spec
sheet so looks like it's gonna happen so
if any of you back that campaign you
should be pretty happy right about now
but we'll see keep an eye on this smock
is a fun word to say it is very fun
mozzie and smock Z just makes it even
funnier
mock-mock-mock the battery life
estimated around five hours while gaming
and fan noise should be similar to the
Nintendo switch according to the CEO
which I'm not sure how loud that in kind
of switches not too familiar with it but
31 decibels is what they're rating it at
because there is an actual CPU fan
inside the unit which is somewhat unique
to handhelds or it's somewhat uncommon
on a lot of handheld devices but
obviously with quite a bit more yeah I'm
hoping not to again Nintendo switch
rival noises perhaps it gives something
like a nice gentle breeze over your
pants as you as you play that would be
that would be good to be you know a
multi multi purposed that's innovation
right there I'm all for it so moving on
to the H 500 P white mesh from
Coolermaster obviously we heard we saw a
lot of the Coolermaster got a lot of
backlash with their initial 500 H 500 P
because it had a full acrylic front
panel and the mesh on the sides was too
far back almost on the sides of the fan
not allowing it to intake enough fresh
air and we found almost almost 10 degree
difference
taking off that front panel alone gamers
Nexus was a huge a huge proponent you're
gonna say asshole no huge daddy just a
really a dick about
what kind of asshole gives full you know
unbiased reviews that's that's what a
dick no he definitely explored this
scientifically and found that the front
panel was hindering the amount of intake
air flow that this case could do he
brought the hammer down brought the
hammer in coverage and coolermaster
listened apparently with this mesh mesh
mesh if I'd version it's not a fractal
case but it does have two layers of mesh
the steel exterior mesh and there's like
a finer mesh underneath it that's the
actual dust filter so the external mesh
is kind of just there for aesthetics and
then they have a finer mesh underneath
that maybe just like an inch beneath it
yeah for the XL filtration double mesh
it's there's not really a picture of it
here but yeah that we got we got a
chance to take a look at this and at the
what they were working on at CES right
and it really seemed like the the main
problems that you know Steve and several
other reviewers brought up they they
address seemed favor dress pretty well
so yeah obviously it needs independent
testing again and all that kind of stuff
yeah one of the issues that I was
lamenting over in my review of the of
the case was the power supply
installation and how you couldn't
install it from the rear you had to
actually pop off the power supply shroud
but that required you and screwing like
eight different screws and it was a huge
pain in the ass like the worst power
supply installation for a high-end case
in this price point I've ever seen and
they fixed it so um you can install it
right from the rear now so they made
quite a bit a few improvements over just
the the front panel area still get a
nice tempered glass side panel those
gorgeous 200 millimeter RGB fans which
now have white frames because it's all
white and stuff so are you gonna take a
look at this one um I don't know I feel
like I feel like reading the article
kind of already dibs does it yeah by all
means
no I actually already just said okay for
them to send one one over earlier today
so I'm actually I will do a video on
this at some point and in the near
future I think I'm actually taking a
look at one of their other cases you
remember the trooper oh yeah they have
the SC version now that has ten
I'm using it for my 10 Gigabit Ethernet
server pass and they just sent it to me
that I wanted the striker because I I'm
getting a Tai Chi motherboard I was like
who the black and white will match it
they're like we don't have the strikers
they said we have one sample in but the
colors off it's a prototype we can't
send it to you or it can't be on video I
was like Fox I mean the trooper then is
more or less the same case so wait the
trooper is the white one right no the
striker was the white one the striker
was the white one that had like the
white LEDs on the side with the hard
drive cage yeah that was the striker and
then the trooper was basically like a
black version of it still had the nine
expansion or the nine five and a quarter
inch bays the front they were kind of
just like yeah you you you probably know
because you have more recent I just had
the CM storm trooper and it's like storm
trooper really you're not gonna get like
sued by Lucasfilm over that right like
and then I thought that was meant the
storm trooper was the white one but that
I always felt the names sugar eggs
bucket yeah yeah I was I was like that
case I'm cuz I'm a sucker for cases with
handles on yes exactly and it has active
side intake cooling on over the over the
hard drive cages which yes which is nice
if you're gonna you know do a stack of
drives in there something yeah a really
cool case and after they put the
tempered glass it's amazing like that
case I feel like those cases were ahead
of their time cuz if you as soon as you
put a tempered glass side panel on it
just looks like a modern case yeah and
even the internal layouts are pretty
smart back then so we'll be checking
that out but because of that circling
back here I probably won't take a look
at the HR hundred P white mesh anytime
soon because I'm already started dealing
with that coolermaster case but stay
tuned impulse channel I was he will be
writing a sample of that so uh good
stuff from coolermaster moving on here
we've got some other cases some budget
oriented cases from Kolok which I have
never heard of cool
I think it's calling a link that's how
you pronounce you baby they're releasing
some budget cases this is from
overclocked 3d by the way coinkidink so
thank you over there to those guys it's
a co-inky-dink what a co-inky-dink
what a coinkidink but they're also
making cases
nice yeah that's that's where we're at
right now we have only on our second
beer so they have the observatory and
the stronghold two different cases very
similar though they both are supporting
up to e ATX motherboards they have a
very similar internal layout however the
exterior aesthetic is slightly different
from case to case the observatory is a
bit more rounded has some softer
features the stronghold has got some
sharper rectangular features you might
also notice they've kind of borrowed
Observatory as the strong yes I think so
well actually I don't know I don't
Cournoyer you saying this is the only
rounded corner I see yours right here
yeah oh yeah
then you're probably right I missed that
corner yeah exactly
yep which kind of very much looks like
the Corsair dust vent doesn't it the 570
X Canada's right kind of does the first
when I saw it I was like wait they got
the picture round that's right
that's a Kalinka they're taking a child
so yeah I I feel like these cases are
there if you want to pay very little for
a premium looking exterior so they're
pretty inexpensive 63 no this is all you
know in great British pounds 63 great
british pens for the observatory 36
great British pounds for the stronghold
so probably like $45 for that one and
maybe $80 for the Observatory which is
pretty damn cheap I mean if you get a
case for under $50 and it looks like
that great the sacrifice where they cut
corners and how they make their margins
is on the internal layout so the
internals are very much budget oriented
cells sparse so you might have a hard
time building in this thing it probably
won't be as smooth as something like you
know a p400 eclipse from from fantex
version so you've got this space here
this is just empty like the radiators
drive man oh right there
there's maybe some Drive mats down at
the bottom maybe behind the behind the
the motherboard tray but it doesn't look
like there's a ton of room behind there
so cable management might be a little
bit difficult even though you do get a
power supplies there's certainly no
rubber grommets to be seen yeah exactly
that's a surefire way you can tell it's
budget but first thing to go with the
budget cases if you just care about the
exterior then this may look into moving
on though msi is launching their or they
have launched their optics MGP series
curved gating motors that I did get the
chance to look at briefly at CES I did I
think I did a video on it on one of them
we have the MGP 2 7c and the MGP 2 7cq
so I'm just gonna refer to them for now
as the C and the C Q models they're both
27-inch curved displays with a was an
1800 are 1800 are curved
VA LED panel 1 millisecond response time
48 to 144 Hertz refresh rate with
adaptive sync
however the C model is 1920 by 1080 and
the C Q is quite HD or 2560 by 1440 this
video is enthralling the 1440p model
also has a higher maximum brightness at
700 nits there's a 50 on the c model
dude has to break into the laboratory to
steal some serious able to monitor cuz
obviously this is where they got it Oh
Liam is being developed in this
government laboratory Oh MSI actually
built this robot it's a big
collaboration intelligence collaboration
with Austin Dynamics to make three
career broken in laboratories steal this
monitor obviously we wouldn't have this
technology at this point in time it's
long you know something only the
government would have yes this is this
video was actually a leaked by
what's-his-face
yeah the monitor actually also has a
mind of its own we'll move around on its
own that's he can give his name
I like that let's let's take another
look at their monitors just kind of just
kind of stretching this measure how much
that RGB on the back yeah that's what it
does so no one can see it you heard it
here first folks
RGB of Shane's monitor
so is amazing Snowden I was thinking of
Snowden I was trying to say I was trying
I was trying to say this video is by
Snowden himself how far down this is
done this little side path can I take us
all right sorry please please continue
okay so ignore everything I said it's
all fake and wrong no everything is
false it is true you should all be
terrified yeah so I guess the real wow
factor here apart from just being like
another curved panel is that it has
prism seek illumination so those five
RGB LED zones that you see on the bottom
bezel yeah those can be programmed
they're programmable within the
SteelSeries engine software so you can
make them show you things like your
ammunition in-game your health you can
even have a display we're giving
notifications for discord
that'll give us I gotta give msi credit
for at least the demos that they had
gone on at CES
they were very quickly able to take you
up maybe they had just done it enough
times at the by the time I went up that
went there soon they will very quick
quickly take you up to look at the
monitor
get you into the game and show you like
okay you should here and like one of
these little bars you can set to count
your headshots right every time you get
a headshot you know one of the lights
lights up and if you yeah 10 or
something like that or to show
ammunition or that kind of thing it's
it's one of those things where it's like
I've seen attempts of doing that before
unlike it like with a keyboard you know
like the like you have RGB keyboards
special lights on it and stuff and I
rarely see them actually used cuz it's
like you pregnant lease you're making
you're not looking down at the keyboards
right the chances of you actively seeing
something down there supposed to you
know something that you just pop up on
the screen somewheres make some more
quickie and usable with this it's right
below the screen so it's a little bit
more in your peripheral vision so I
could see someone using this it's
probably still gonna be kind of a a
niche thing but I would imagine it
actually getting the most use out of
like NMOS where you have where you can
program like cooldowns okay where you
can program cooldowns or in-game timers
where timing is very important fps
I don't really see a huge need I think
it's more just the cool factor and like
that's nice to have but I could see a
lot of MMO players who are really
serious or you know
RTS players perhaps actually making
really good use out of this I'd like to
get like it professionals like a you
know eSports pros perspective on this
but the pricing here is four hundred and
forty nine give up again everything's in
great British pounds because it's a
hexxus does that clerical so so 449
great British pounds for the C model and
then 519 across the CPU yeah so um
that's pretty that's not bad maybe about
600 us for the 1440p model I think
that's that's doable weird thing though
is that there's no free sink damn it
it has adaptive vsync but it doesn't
have actual free sink support so I guess
there's that not that we can really
afford many video cards anyway right now
but let's move on
energizer did you know energizer make
smartphones Paul what ya know ya know in
the battery life Seth silly
everything else is great no I'm just
kidding it's actually the complete
opposite again this articles from a
hexxus energizer teased their power max
P 16 K Pro which is a upscale smartphone
fitted with a sixteen thousand milliamp
battery I didn't know that they could do
that I mean is it is it as thick as like
my arm like how the hell do they do that
it's probably super thick it also
features a but it says it features an
ultra slim design despite having an
enormous battery or an enormous capacity
sized battery ultra slim design I mean
it can't be more than it can't be less
than 10 millimeter well you know Ultra
is one of those subjectively
quantifiable you know adjectives and
probably adding to anything and
immediately you're like oh obviously
ultra I don't know I blame like BMW
right BMW the ultimate driving machine
it's like it's like you take a you take
an adjective like that it's like BMW if
you really made the ultimate driving
machine then you would never have had to
make any of more than one car that's
true ever definition well because not
everyone can not everyone can can afford
the ultimate version that's
it's only ultimate
image in in certain areas which means
the ultimate in price means they're
lying to you because they're not
fulfilling their promise of making the
we because they said they only make one
thing we didn't say confessing lis
ultimate so the sub optimal price so
with optimal price and I believe this
energizer your phone will probably be
the ultimate oh yeah sickness absolutely
ultimate with the ultimate slim design
ultimate thick it does have a six-inch I
accidentally put six foot but no it
doesn't have a six foot full HD screen
it's six inches 16 cakes are pimp
no wonder it needs a huge battery 128
gigs of storage no micro SD card slot a
projector and you know it seems like it
has a decent enough camera USB C which
is good
I like that that's yeah alright that's
good yeah it sounds like they've done
their homework we should be more
positive because honestly of all the
things and phones that I feel like it
was one of the always one of the top
things is always battery life so any
phone even if it's a little thick true
like like battery life is more important
to me so so gay energizer for
championing battery life apparently this
is gonna be able to go like 17 days on
standby that's impressive
just said like I haven't charged my
phone in weeks like holy crap so I'm
pricing and availability to be
determined obviously but it is coming
that's what she said let's move on say
the next article from overclocked 3d
this is the Asus GTX 1050 and 1050 ti
Cerebrus models served Cerberus Cerberus
sorry sorry sir I can't I can't spell
Cerberus carebears Cerberus I'm gonna
call it Care Bears sure the Care Bear
models which have officially launched at
this point neither of which require any
external power which is great so you can
get all of your power straight from the
PCIe slot I believe it's up to 75 watts
through your motherboard which is great
that is correct designed for in-game I
cafes is what the article says that's
interesting to me
I didn't realize in game manufactures I
know for you caffeine's
I cafes like internet cafe oh yeah yeah
which I guess you know if you got a
bunch of 1080p screens that's gonna get
the job done for most games right tweak
the settings a little bit with a 100 and
so every card here in the Cerberus
lineup ships with a 144 hour burnin test
already completed for quality assurance
both of these cards a 1050 and the times
of Ti are getting the same PCB and
cooler there's really no difference
there although the TI model will ship
with 4 gigs of v-ray whereas you'll only
get two on the non TI model model block
aluminum heatsink pretty much standard
design with dual 80 millimeter fans they
are smaller so they might be a little
bit noisier but then again it's a lower
power card so it's probably not going to
get us hot which means the fan self to
spin up as much it's probably gonna be
quiet is what I would imagine it does
have a 3 plus 1 phase beer and design
with a couple outputs including DVID the
digital HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4
both of these models non TI NT I will
ship with a moderate factory overclock
you'll be able to push that further of
course at your own will and we've got
some bass and boost clocks on the TI
model of thirteen hundred and forty-one
megahertz and fourteen hundred and
fifty-five respectively and on the non
TI 1400 and four and fifteen hundred and
eighteen both of them will ship with
seven gigahertz memory speeds so the
other question is how much will these
actually retail for I think we're gonna
see a pretty hefty markup on these just
because we're already seeing that with
existing 10 a 10 15 10 20 T eyes on the
market proud looking at a sale price yes
a 300 of 5300 for the 750 370 999 for
these 750ti used to be that high no I
mean maybe I don't know that seems
pretty high even for the current
inflation and stuff
and what are 10:50 is going for are they
desert around 200 bucks yeah 250 right
intended to TI's maybe 250 I'm sure they
probably go up to 300 but 250 and I
think for me because we've got a couple
options now as an APU is just hitting
the store shelves that maybe a 1050 or
attend entity I would be excuse me would
be a better option if you want a game at
1080p my goodness this is very
carbonated the combination is doing its
ok its bidding so I think the rising EP
use are great but at the same time if I
was really struggling to build a gaming
PC right now I'd probably just go for a
1050 or 1050 TI bite the bullet pay
quite a bit more for it but since it's
such an entry-level card its inflated
price is still within the realm of
affordability for most people I feel
where most people can fork out 150 250
bucks as opposed to like 800 or even
like 500 for like a 10 60 and you can
still get some pretty decent 1080p
gaming performance out of these cars
especially if you overclock and you have
decent CPU to pair it with so I like I
think this is sort of a good option
right now I think 10 50s and 1050 TI's
are probably gonna be selling pretty
well within the next couple months until
prices for GPUs go down the world
so that's all I don't know I hate the
idea of paying you know fifty to a
hundred percent more Oh me to pay it's
not it's not ideal
I cringe is thinking about it but at the
same time it also sucks if you're really
into PC gaming you you're you're on a
Nintendo DS you know and that's like oh
you're getting your face ah but I do I
will say for what it's worth the AAP use
that AMD ap use provide a fairly
passable 1080 gaming experience and if
you're willing to get by for now and if
you're a principled person where you
like it no I don't but if wanna pay all
that extra money right and and you can
be just spiteful be like numb obstinate
and I'm gonna hold out then I think you
can get by yeah yeah what's next come on
to our next segment which is pin my PC
you guys have tweeted me your pictures
and we're gonna yell at you and tell you
what you did wrong he's super fun
computers there's no way you guys
subject yourself to this crab masochism
week after week but we enjoy it we love
it Dave and pretend and I build a
computer yeah Tim alright first our
first subject is proto height also for
the record I see all of you guys
donating in super chet thank you so much
my gosh Ian's we will be reading all the
messages you attach to those donations
at the end of this half of the show so
so stop dreaming don't stop briefly
though it's gonna be a brief so if you
ask us questions brief makes them like
very short question yeah don't ask us
about our like entire life story okay
but thank you alright proto Highland
burn NZXT s340 elite in white a gigabyte
970 ad s3p am3+ motherboard and FX 6300
with a stock cooler and r7 260x two
gigabyte GPU eight gigs of ram
and oh he's got an aching stick and a
four gig stick wait he's got two four
gig sticks and two two gig sticks
interesting got 12 gigs of RAM here
that's across four sticks short wireless
card and of course air CX 550 power
supply alright so the first rule of
order is to well all right your stock
cooler
I would I would expect to stock cooler
on a 6300 especially if it's been used
for a while to be a little on the noise
generating and slightly annoying side
yeah I mean they can vary there was a
there was a pretty wide variance in the
different fans and and coolers at AMD
had over the the the like aim aim three
and am3+ and FM two products they sold
so anyway put his stock heatsink fan so
yeah that would that kind of sucks I
would say upgrade your platform yeah
obviously we're looking at it and what a
system that's moving towards the more
outdated side so so yeah that that's not
the best we've got the red LED clear
clear fan right yeah so that's like the
clear heels yeah clear yes we're calling
that clear here we are ready is that
it's not you know if you want to be if
you ought to be all flashy and out there
and like
you know like me whatever then then you
know go for the clear the clear plastic
led fan but yeah I feel like you got to
own it it's not the classiest I feel
like if you're gonna use the clear leb
fan like your whole system has to
revolve around that you have to make it
the theme the heart and embrace it then
yes but I have much just how much prefer
to I much prefer LED strips or just like
as there's there's fans that have LEDs
that aren't necessarily the clear
plastic anyway right you have a pretty
solid case here I mean it's a nice
looking case your power supply has you
know decent looking black cabling your
kill management's could be improved upon
a bit you do have some gaps down here at
the bottom for instance where you can
reroute some of those cables just to
make some of the runs a little bit
shorter and that kind of thing but yeah
ultimately you're looking at probably a
core system upgrade at some point I
would say and if you do upgrade I would
get a because that looks like a thin ATX
board if you got a full sized one it
would actually clean up your cables a
little bit because you can adjust them
as far across to get to those to get to
that kind of angry all right thank you
prototype for sending in your submission
next is Rene Gosselin with a 4770k
system overclocked 4.2 gigahertz with an
N 520 cooler a 87 d3h motherboard from
gigabyte 32 gigs of 1866 speed memory to
GTX 760 s and SLI three SSDs two hard
drives 750 senator pretty watt power
supply and it's a micro ATX build so Wow
Mike good there's a lot of shit in here
you know that for a micro ATX there's a
lot of stuff I mean you can you can go
for a full tower you go for a cosmos
with this much shit which is great
you've managed to compact it all into
this tiny space and it looks like a very
well used and well-loved system which is
great
that being said holy moly this is the
crow dentist and hip is their total
crow's nest but the power supply cables
just sort of like
looks like someone's entrails just get
gutted so all kinds of fire my first the
first thing that's standing out to me
because right functionally speaking
cable management's you know can be
horrible and you can solve a functional
system you have I'm seeing three sticks
of RAM right is there is there force
there
I see three but it's different so
there's a fourth HyperX very different
so 1332 gig 1866 alright because seen
from Resident Evil so yeah it looks like
we got optical drive up here - is that -
optical drives just man like well I I
mean I I'm I ain't much going on I have
so much appreciation for the use of
space in here yeah that it's it's
detracting for my ability to critique
you know get a bigger case yeah get a
bigger case and what was the cpu oh you
have a great CPU it's a 4770k ditched
our ethics cards and get one yeah yeah
one faster card it'll clean up the
cabling and it'll clean up the
aesthetics overall it's such a hard ask
right now power supply is great don't
change it price place fund changer your
core platform just swap out your usually
does use dust it and get a better case
I've never seen what cases I've never
been one to recommend SLI for for like
the mid to low end range cards like SLI
for anything that's like I know for me
and be like GG X 1080 level or above
maybe 10 70s if that but like I don't
know like the 60 level cards and then
that kind of thing anything that's like
300 bucks and below I feel like SLI is
is often kind of wasted so right I don't
know
you probably get some decent boost from
your seven sixties depending on the
games that you're playing so it's hard
to say just ditch him right now I would
like I would agreed upgrade to a single
a single better graphics card and that
would clean up things a lot and give you
a lot more space but yeah
a new case I think would do you yeah
because obviously you have nowhere to
put your excess cables
and there's a really budget looking case
for the amount of hardware you have in
here and then your cooler the hood which
one is it's it's a cooler register the
n5 20 from Coolermaster it's a it's a
weird little cooler it's not that bad
like it's better it's definitely a
decent step up from it from a stock
heatsink fan it's still just a little
weird it's like it's kind of offset it's
got to you it's got to like 92
millimeter fans on it I think yes that's
a little awkward to me as well I don't
know I mean you got some nice core
components in there especially your you
know your processor your motherboard
there's 2 gigs of ram pretty solid in
there so anyway get a new case in case
that has good cable management Thank You
Renee and let us move on move on
repealing another FX 6300 based system
at 3.5 gigahertz gtx 750ti 8 gigs of
ddr3 g.skill memory one turbit hard
drive and what there will take power
supply and some LED fans you know if you
have attended TTI I would say your FX
6300 is probably all right you know if
you're happy with the performance that
you're getting in game with the current
config then I wouldn't change it again
we're dealing with that blue LED clear
fan the clear for which you know why not
red
I mean even if it's clear why not red
because you already have a bunch of red
going on in your your RAM by the way if
you get another Ram stick there's only
one in there and the red on your heat
sinks I think that would look nice let
me just provide a counter here and I
know we've just no trashing the no you
know just been trashing the clear LED
fans this is not a it's not the best for
me but it's not horrible
because they're all now matching you got
three matching blue LED fans and red
white and blue on black no I hate
patriotism okay Miss America I don't
mind your color scheme your power supply
is
you know it's it's got some some not not
that great of a coloring on the cabling
you got the catch of a mustard of course
going at it looks like you have a single
stick of ya memory that's what I'm
saying but you get another guy in there
which is I mean it's it's a gig so okay
but you can do dual channel with that so
I don't know you could upgrade to a
second stick and get 16 gigs I don't
know it would look nicer too but then
again it's ddr3 so I wouldn't spend too
much money on more ddr3 right now
overall given what you're working with I
feel like you have a pretty clean
looking build yeah and I appreciate the
various angles that you gave us with
your pictures as well so yeah I like it
it's hard to say too much as far as what
you could do to improve the aesthetics
here cable management I feel like all
right so that rear blue fan I feel like
the cable for that is kind of just here
right right on top of the heat so you're
right Kyle that's one thing that I'm pet
peeve I or that I'm just peeved by is
when cables are in front of the heatsink
the heat sinks are there for like
functional purposes and also they look
nice so if your cables just sort of
bunched up in front of it it kind of
ruins that effect I take you back
everything I said Paul's wrong to build
this hideous so you can maybe just tuck
the the cable between your heat sink
your vrm heat sink and your CPU cooler I
think it would look cleaner in that
general area that's typically where your
eyes are drawn to and a system is the
CPU area that would little a little
cleaner but angry overall nice build
well spoken Kyle beep moving on is Evan
dot PNG hey guys love of the streams we
got a rise in seven 1700 at 3.8
gigahertz an asus be 350 motherboard of
course our H 115 I Pro all-in-one liquid
cooler 2 terabyte hard drive 120 gig SSD
NZXT USB hub GTX 1066 gig which he got
before the mining crazy thank goodness
and here's their landing the pro for RGB
Z's alright so cool this is a your your
your cable cabling here has some sort of
a it's white but it has sort of a
silvery Sheen to it it does and you know
it's pleasing it's definitely not
ketchup and mustard and you've gone the
extra mile to get some aftermarket
cables here but they're not super
trained well they're kind of a 4-pin
society for me the 24-piece a little
little kink going on there with the
eight pin there yeah I don't know what
yeah I mean it's hard to say exactly how
you could fix that but it is you know it
does stand out as kind of a little
awareness I find it interesting that you
seem very proud of your USB hub yeah why
would you show that maybe there was any
room elsewhere I'm pretty sure this
other room for it was for convenience no
it's interesting it does seem like it
like it specifically routed out here to
be like look at all my USB 2.0 yeah that
I'm right it break it off and to me it
looks it's distracting in a sense and it
kind of ruins that clean aesthetic of
that cable management bar article bar
that is so you know classic of those
NZXT cases there there are definitely
certain products like you know you got
your SSD down here you know and and
obviously there's no practical reason to
like move the SSD right out there where
it's visually it can be seen there but
that but that's a prestige position
there yeah that's where it's like hey
look at this nice unfortunate wishing
you to look look at it yes look USB 2.0
hub I feel like is there's there's less
of a like right sexy about a USB hub so
that nothing sexy that I might kiss
sure consider repositioning that
elsewhere in the case where it's less
visual other than that everything look
it's looking pretty clean I mean you got
a nice a nice color scheme going on due
to the fact that it is primarily black
and whites the few other accent colors
like the bit of orange and copper on
your graphics card you know they're not
clashing too much or anything like that
so right yeah yeah but really nice
little build there yeah all together
well done so thank you very much Evan
very nice PC next we've got coalition
gaming with Xeon X 5656 court at 4
gigahertz 8 gigs of RAM a Radeon 7970
gigahertz Edition with big stupid cooler
that has 140 millimeter fans glued on
and is supported by Legos EVGA 600 watt
power supply cm liquid-like 240 AIO
better pic of big dumb cooler also
attached thank you very much for that
specific explanation coalition so that's
what we're looking at here though that's
a substantial interesting it's actually
cooler there interesting I wonder what
kind of temps are getting on that to be
honest I'm very curious okay Wow all
right I'm huge so if that's not the
native that's not the stock heatsink on
no no no it's very much not so I don't
know who makes that cooler
so that's aftermarket just nice yes it's
an aftermarket on some of you cooler
okay that was probable but I don't know
that like I'm wondering if it's the same
company there was a company I feel like
they were based in Europe you know they
made this passive CPU air cooler through
your GP you know that it was for the CPU
but it was just it was just huge it's
basically I could get a full sized ATX
case and you stick this thing on and
it's basically just a block and a bunch
of heat pipes going off of it and then
just like all these finned radiators
that like takes up most of your cases
it wasn't the macho zero was it no it
wasn't this fucking thing no no I'm
talking
it had multiple like the motivation
powers multiple of those like suspended
in the case okay I I don't think it's a
builder stone maybe no it's not - Sierra
95 because I've worked with the CRN 85
I'm sure I'll think of it it's not yes
right no no this dang it I wish I had a
better memory synthase anyway you sighs
I bring that up is its biz because the
this thing made for this GPU reminds me
of it but yeah he's got to 240
millimeter fans attached to the bottom
of that thing so that's pretty cool I
hope I hope it's overclocked yeah yeah
right all right cooling standing up most
of me here is I mean other than that
cooler and seen then it's and then when
it's all like I like this I like this
picture this isn't I like this in use
picture because again here I feel like
we've gone on a journey when it comes to
the clear LED fans here because clear
blue LED fans and yet the system on
there like I stand out green that's
obviously kind of the the focal point of
the system right mm-hm so that's kind of
working for me that's true no freakin
heatsink it's got a it's a 7970 with one
of the the blue there the turquoise PCB
so you know you're kind of owning that
at the same time a little bit a little
bit I guess
alright so other than that Oh what do we
have to say you got you got solid kill
management going on I don't see anything
standing out the cable ketchup and
mustard obviously hmm you know it's
routed well but it stands out color wise
so maybe a little cable extension there
couldn't hurts or something for the my
OC diesel to buy the CPU cooler cold
plate or the water block just been
rotated yeah but like I mean rotate that
90 degrees and get a little more slack
give a little more slack than it would
to be wherever you shape all right so
yeah that's probably something we can do
it's not gonna droop down enough to like
encounter your graphics gardener or
anything so maybe considering a 45
degree rotation counter clockwise of
your CPU cooler and I also wonder why
the rear exhaust fan is set to intake
and I'm wondering if there's a dust
filter for that I wonder that - Cal yeah
it keeps me up at night
I wonder that it does appear to be
another LED strip down here at the
bottom providing a little more accent
lighting yeah
it's crossing hey it's my system yeah
coalition gave me you know and and you
know it's a setup - with the Zeon six
core is he on there - yeah extra session
- that over last but not least we have
an honorable mention for tonight this is
from a 4 a.m. fellow and he sent in his
picture of a risin 5 1600 system with an
asus rog be 350 motherboard and an EVGA
gtx 1070 super clock Edition inside the
what case is this I don't know I don't
recognize this the panel here you see
sonic 520 no that's better the power
supply but what cases this chat Corsair
270 is that is that what it is
maybe your maybe your own 70 are okay
270 our course your case - to set a
course here - 37-year ok all right
for some reason I love this system just
because it kind of disappears like like
it looks so insanely clean but the
components aren't like incredibly high
end or anything also I love the carbon
fiber that you put in your cryo rig age
five I think that just looks super sick
then I'm not a huge carbon-fiber fan to
be honest I don't hate it but I'm not
like it doesn't like oh my god
stimulated when it's done tastefully
when it's done tastefully like in this
case which is very rare in my opinion
some people just tend to plaster it on
everything you know its carbon fiber it
automatically makes it look good no
this looks really good like if he's
really really doing that and put it on
the on the power supply shroud and on
the panel at the back right that
would've been overdone right here
there's a fine line it's just a bit of
an accent carbon fibers as runs a very
fine box a very fine line between
tasteful and tacky and I think you
nailed it here mister sir and just just
the fact it just looks so it looks like
dark it looks dark and moody
there's something about though it's so
moody to me like it has a personality
for some really good it has a soul I
don't know decent photo - very good
photo that helps - lighting and stuff
the cable managing like that those cable
and I like the fact also guys take notes
I'll take some for myself that the only
cables you really see are the 24 pin and
your GPU oh look and I think that's it's
a carving cooler do we already say that
yes H right he did follow up pictures so
here it is
he also did the before and after like
wow anyone anyone who's got the stock
AMD heat sink fan he was really sitting
an upgrade and this is your motivation
this is solid before and after upgrade
look yeah at that oh this thing just so
much more beastly I also love those not
too offends that you put at the front
just that tad of like you know kind of
grayish silver those are the Redux
series fans I believe which I used
recently in a February's PC at the month
but she'll be you guys will be seeing
soon those are really really nice
extremely quiet high-quality fans
obviously not too bad just I don't know
everything matches Britain those I feel
like that complements your bet your
memory like your RAM is kind of silvery
those heat sinks by the way what kid is
that team team matches the fans
perfectly I like everything just meshes
together very well here so kudos you sir
well then energy what's next moving on
to face off Paul and I are going to head
to head on the crappy online two-player
game the lured loser has to do something
stupid stupider than they usually do
that's some stupid or stupider than they
he's easily dip so we got to that we
were at that point to show our holy crap
okay cool I've got to enable Adobe Flash
Player I feel alright better grab that
keyboard give us if we're doing this or
something yes I have you don't want to
know what kind of punishment I have
lined up first today Paul I read I read
but you did yeah oh you skipped ahead
was read well what am I supposed to do
cheating cheaters cheating cheating it's
interesting
okay so we're playing we're actually
bringing back the tank trouble this is a
recommendation from someone in chat this
is a fun game because you can easily
commit suicide I'm not saying suicides
fun but you can easily turn the game on
yourself if you're not strategic enough
so you have arrow keys and m-mister
shoot I have WASD and key was to shoot
gonna go over here mmm-hmm yeah see
yourself you can you can lose however
you like so we have ricochet remember
ricocheting I am going wait no I'm not
moving but it's because you're driving
into the wall wait what oh oh oh wait no
hold on hold on I don't know how to move
forward
oh wait II oh okay I got I'm good I'm
good oh no oh no oh no go away balls
Paul I don't want your balls right now
anyway cousin chasing oh they're making
funny noises too
around you I dodge oh my god you stood
there what is this okay so what are we
playing - you gonna play the first two
three probably okay
first first player 2 3 ys 3 of 5 ok no
no no balls away I'm so scared oh my god
oh my god there's no way this is
happening I do nothing you're so good at
this
unknowingly like it-it's just for no
reason you just have to kind of trust
coming back to me I'm just I'm just
hauling ass alright alright still not
sure what this so I'm red by the way
guys I'm ready
oh oh no no no wait whoa what does it do
late a bomb I had a bomb thingy wow that
was cool
oh my god my game people hey did I do
that all right that was terrible that
was a cheap shot man
cheap shot low blow sir you got to take
advantage of this okay
so sorry headphone users rest in peace
all that stuff but no super fun I need
to turn your your compressor up more I
think I'm good now I think the worst is
behind us but the punishment that I have
for today I said Paul will read me a
I've actually concocted my own sort of
like Mad Libs paragraph okay you're
gonna ask me what you know what certain
adjectives and verbs and like blank fill
in the blank things that I need to
answer okay and then you're gonna make
me tweet the end result to a random
youtuber alright alright so support away
how okay so so you can see it in the
show doc you have to ask me and you have
to also write down what are the which
words that I choose so you have to
document this and I'll try to forget
exactly what my mad libs paragraph was I
actually kind of don't remember it all
that well that's good
that's good you didn't plan ahead so
I'll just have to uh I'll answer it
first and the show doc is it it's in the
faceoff section no oh I'm sorry yeah no
it's not oh oh here we go
liar okay right okay now okay so you
remember you fill in the blanks so you
have to write down everything I say okay
so I will write down and I'll just come
up with the first thing I'll say the
first thing that pops in my head
we're not allow it we're not letting
chat do this
oh you want to do that yes I'm glad Ivan
that would make yes sincerity no it you
already know it okay fine
all right so chat we need a we need a
pet name a pet name a pet name first
person to put in a pet name um speaking
of pet names the dogs or dogs are crying
getting they're getting upset that
they've been separated from us and then
also we need a verb ending in ing I like
Sparky we're gonna go Sparky Sparky
alright
we also need a verb ending in ing Benny
and ing after the verb any and ing we
will need a body part yes I'm trying to
go ahead just a little bit so we can we
see fingering I mean fingering things
for fingering fingering and after the
body part we're gonna need a liquid a
liquid liquid so fingering liquid so
body part arm foot elbow arm was the
first one I think that's stupid okay
I saw ankle
bye after liquid we need an adjective
adjective of course always important
liquid let's see what liquids do you
have you guys come up with
there's beer vodka piss gasoline is that
primo chill view it's Remo spill view do
you promote chill vo genius yeah pretty
much I love you so after the adjective
we'll need a verb past tense
give us a verb past tense and date so
right now we need a adjective I see
Ewing spewing humping a CEREC those
adjectives II enough
the first one I saw was edgy edgy yeah
sure you do that or fizzy
we're fizzy I think fizzy I like fizzy
okay I know where I know we're probably
breaking the ad-libs rules here but
fizzy fizzy verb past tense
we have fucked after bursty past tense
we need a family member
roasted ducked a plural noun
yes and a pet name there's the last ones
family member
plural noun pet pet name
alright so verb past tense Curt arrested
what is that gargled gorg IC gargled
alright gargle gargle 'don't poor man
poor man will noon is gotta be seems
stuck in the family members little noun
people we're moving on doggies Utes Oh
fu chaps chaps fires hot dogs felons
eggs watermelon melons and then we need
one more pet names one more pet name art
will do melons one more pet name people
this is one more awesome that name all
right one more pet name whatever it was
speaking of pet name what are we doing
after this we're done oh good
bandit bucko classic T Rufus
dog Oh slut I kind of like can't
bandit or are you going for slut I mean
I don't know what your pet names
typically know what the theme is these
are ridiculous
Bilbo Baggins okay whistling nice aw I
forget what was it bandit bandit bandit
nurse all right dude bandit
okay that's it that's it all locked in
stop all your suggestions now before we
break the internet I'll ready all I'll
read the Madlib we read the monster we
ever ate and then you're gonna have it
all clean it out - who will get to that
movie
okay crossing we got hey Sparky just
want to apologize for fingering your
thigh last night after my fifth shot of
pre-much Hillview I devolved into a
fizzy state we must all control I may
have also gargled your granny it's not
Jewish which explains why you're out of
melons your bandit obviously I God okay
when one explains the other no that's
just what promotion that's what that's
what do it that's why you shouldn't do
shots pretty much of you that had things
happen it's like the new for look oh
that's why you watch awesome hardware is
to learn this so here's how we're gonna
choose I've actually come up with a list
of 10 different youtubers or whatever
Tech people to be completely away yes
we're literally spending more time on
the punishment that we did play in the
game this is
it's worth it trust me so I'm gonna
choose the number one through ten and
then you're gonna choose number one
through ten okay and we're gonna add
those two numbers together and then
that'll tell us who are who are person
is okay once it goes past ten that goes
back to one oh okay
so if I if my numbers 10 and yours is
too then we're gonna choose whoever - I
see right makes more sense now yeah okay
so you to pick a number one through ten
in your head I'll pick one okay I got it
okay
say the number of the same time one two
three nine so eight that's seventeen
seventeen so number seven verse seven
who's number seven that's right that's
mr. Salazar Greg Salazar studio you guys
are wondering all right potential
alternatives where Luke Linus Wendel J
Dimitri Austin Evans random Frank P
Joker and Jerry pretty comprehensive
list all right so so relook Greg all
right
Kyle's gonna tweets Greg right now and
this why don't you.why like craft up
yeah isn't he engaged now isn't that
gonna be what if his what if I ruin
their entire engagement probably will oh
my god this is gonna be glorious but he
has a sense of Greg has a sense of humor
it was great it was great how you like
ruin my life like that was good that was
really good Peraza
all right so good in the meantime while
Carl queues that up here we have a
couple other things to go over real
quick so we're gonna start going to end
down donation comments guys we still
haven't come up with a solution for
donation comments and making things
shorter but we're gonna try to run
through these really quickly we know
they sometimes take a lot of time so if
you have been making donations
we very much appreciate it but we're
also would be super appreciative if you
keep your questions or comments very
simple for us I guess what's your
favorite film be perfect okay
first off average bill $5 donation says
never fart in the shower
unless you're showering with a
significant other in that case let it
rip no good advice average bill
pup Shepard with the $10 donation I
would love to set up lights and fans in
my room that can interact with games to

with the $10 donation really appreciate
you Kyle and Paul thank you for us we
appreciate you too finished my first
build this month we didn't pimp my PC
from his Twitter handle thanks for all
the helpful videos and tips cheers to
you both Thank You Forrest and we
appreciate everyone who sends in their
pictures for Pitt my PC Kyle has some
arbitrary way of deciding on it and I
don't know I'm not privy to it so that
allows me to diffuse Wow to deflect it
Wow way to put it all on me I've chosen
Pitt my peasy one time you were here in
jail and you never said thank you
actually that was so long ago it was
alright let's move on thank you for a
Smith Street vulture seven one seven
five dollar donation how do you
overclock memory and plug-in timings
because mine's at 3066 with Rison &amp;amp; GP
prices on video I would say our MSRP
maybe an MSRP maybe not in stock hard to
tell you exactly it's a difficult
question to answer right here but
plugging in XMP timings is often the
simplest way so if your motherboard has
a list of memory that they have approved
that works usually they'll tell you
whether the XMP timings worked it
you get that memory and plug it into
your motherboard and just set the XMP
settings it should work that's the
simplest way to do it
yeah and that's again that we don't have
time and ruch wire $10 Canadian hey guys

planning to build an ass HTTP can handle
4k and VR and Silver's don't see us 381

Oh $5 donation better performances ram
upgrade four to eight gig sticks or to
sixteen gig sticks I would go with to
sixteen gig sticks because it would
provide the capacity assuming you have
four dimm slots that would live you
space for future upgrades performance
wise you're assuming you're talking
about dual channel in both situations
you're not gonna see a significant
difference for two or four sticks
