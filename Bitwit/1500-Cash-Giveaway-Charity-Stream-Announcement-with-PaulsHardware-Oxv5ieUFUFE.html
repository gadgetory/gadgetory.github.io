coming to you today to tell you a couple
announcements actually the first of
which is that you guys might have caught
wind that we were doing like a fan meet
up earlier where we sold off a bunch of
stuff also some hardware forgive my
phone going off in the middle of this
already but we actually collected all
the money that we got from those things
and we're planning to do some cool stuff
with it the first of which is that we're
going to do we're going to host our own
extra life charity stream that's going
to happen on Saturday a December 10th
from 11am to 11pm we're doing a full
fledged 12 hour stream to raise money
for a hospital somewhere in LA or orange
county area we haven't decided exactly
which one yet but it's going to be a
very charitable cause so hopefully you
guys can make it out for that it's going
to be streamed live of course to each of
our twitch channel so twitch TV / paul's
hardware and twitch TV / bit wit KY bit
wait with KY at the end I know it's
confusing but I think that's pretty much
it for that you can also follow us on
Twitter Paul hardware bit wit Kyle for
more details as to when and where
exactly that's going to be streamed yep
Thank You Kyle but the other part that
you guys are probably more interested in
is this big wad of cash as just holding
up because greedy best we're giving this
away or at least giving yeah pretty much
this way we're actually giving you more
than what I have right here away we're
giving away fifteen hundred dollars in
cash and this is a part of the proceeds
from what Kyle and I did when we
liquidated some of our stuff recently so
again the first part of its go into the
charity thing second part here is going

matter where you are all you have to
