I've been using Squarespace to host the
channels official site and merchandise
store for about two years now and
compared to building a site from scratch
the difference has been PC and console
the clean UI makes it easy to create and
customize content embed YouTube videos
social media posts and add new items to
our store a simplified all-in-one
platform means you never have to install
patch or upgrade anything and I can tell
you firsthand there 24/7 customer
support is better than most tech
companies in the PC space they'll tell
them I said that Squarespace has
everything you need for your next domain
website or online store
head to squarespace.com for a free trial
and when you're ready to launch and go
to squarespace.com slash bit wit to save
10% off your first purchase of a website
or domain what's going on guys welcome
back to the channel hope you're all
doing well today we're doing yet another
QA I'm joined yet again by the lovely
wife Esau she's gonna be helping me out
reading the questions off that you guys
have sent to us via Twitter and let's
have some fun let's just dive into our
first question why don't we alright so
the first question is actually something
that everyone has been asking ever since
we posted our vlog well Chris Chris is
unfortunately Chris is dead no no he's
not he's he's perfectly alive and well
in fact he's actually standing behind
the cameras right now I said he was our
X intern in the vlog because technically
his internship was for a fixed period as
he was doing it for college credits
which had a fixed number of hours at the
end to complete he finished those but
hey look he's still here helping us out
he's actually going to be contracting
with us for a little while longer
just with videography and editing and
stuff like that so we're glad that we're
glad that he's not actually you know
what gone yeah I think we had to show
proof that he's still alive and actually
working with us so
Chris yeah where did he go where is he
where is he at I don't see him oh wait
there he is everyone Chris everyone
I the next question what's the hardest
thing about living with and working with
white sauce absolutely nothing she is an
angel absolutely perfect in every single
way what's the best part about living
and working with wifey sauce I don't
know cuz there are just too many things
I can't count that high okay okay
alright alright I'm gonna answer this
I'm gonna answer this straight I think
the most difficult thing is the fact
that we were coworkers but we're also
spouses it can be difficult trying to
create a separation between those two
things when you're at work sometimes I
am in husband mode and not in coworker
mode and vice-versa sometimes we get
home from work and I'm still talking
about work like she's still my coworker
when I have to learn to mentally clock
out when we get home so I'd say that's
that's probably the trickiest part but
other than that I mean it's honestly not
too bad
not nearly as bad as not nearly as bad
as everyone told me it would just
kidding or am i all right is it a better
idea to build a PC or purchase a
prebuilt right now very topical at the
moment with all the inflated prices with
the memory and GPUs that is definitely a
consideration I would say right now if
you really need a gaming system Go Go
the pre-built grub because you know and
I actually did a video on this recently
and ZX T's BLD service which is a
prebuilt service they sell GPUs for MSRP
so I think like you know a 1070 was like
350 when it launched two years ago and
now you can't find one cheaper for seven
eight hundred bucks and ZX T's selling
it at cost
you know obviously you buy the whole
system together
that's definitely the way to go for now
until things all right what is the most
difficult part of being a tech youtuber
there are so many difficult things about
it one is constantly coming up with
creative ideas for content you get
creatively tapped out pretty quickly and
it's it's sort of this Evan flow it's
always up and down sometimes you have
these really great amazing ideas and
they're just flowing out you can't even
contain them all in other days sometimes
weeks at a time there's like a dry spell
and you're just like oh my gosh I feel
so unoriginal right now and I'm just
like rinse and repeating content or you
know getting too much influence from
other creators and things like that
I'd say that's a huge challenge probably
for for any creator to be honest and
then there's also the delicate balance
each balancing act of just having a
social life a regular life and then
working with YouTube working for YouTube
it's never really stops yeah it's the
Internet doesn't sleep you guys never
sleep obviously so I got to keep turning
things out whether it's you know
Christmas morning and we're supposed to
be opening presents or you know moments
before we go out for our anniversary
dinner things like that like I got a I
got a render some stuff and you know
create metadata tags and things like
that so it kind of just all jumbles
together and it can be difficult having
that separation which is why I like the
new office sort of it goes full circle
but we were just mentioning earlier is
that when we come home we kind of like
to put work behind us yeah and that's
really kind of given up set that's that
separation right the AC in this entire
building shuts off at 6:00 p.m. so it's
like okay I got to finish up the last of
what I was doing and head home before I
melt which is actually a good thing
if you could have gamers Nexus hair for
one day but they mean how to go bald for
a year I'm assuming they're they mean
gamers Nexus Steve correct
aka Tech Jesus with the long flowing
locks of hair of course I would take
that off take that off
I mean all you have to do is like curl
your hair or like make it a little bit
more wavy and then you pretty much have
I don't have his curl game he's got some
luscious locks that David I know I'm
quite envious I want to see Steve just
like just shred like a like a guitar
like shred some metal with his hair just
like flying in the air like I had that's
a Jif that I need in my life but getting
back on topic I would definitely take
his hair for a day just so I could see
what he looks like bulb because I think
don't think that would be work I don't
really want to see Steve I don't we make
it you be involved no like but I mean
transitive property if I take Steve's
hair Steve is now bald I just want to
sit here like white man I see Steve
bulbs cuz know everyone likes his hair
too much they don't want to be involved
I I don't think you look very good to
Steve just kidding I would hope so
I would never be with someone who would
agree to be with me and that's all right
this is my next question if people want
to start streaming should they get a
second PC or just one with high specs
well right now building two systems
especially ones with GPUs in them would
be extremely expensive so I mean if your
budget can handle it good for you but
most people probably can't right now and
additionally you might not even need a
dedicated streaming PC because if you
built like a medium or a mid-range to
high-end rig with a decent process or in
it then NN GPU you can probably do both
the no problem and honestly there's
bitrate caps for for twitch and YouTube
that really prevents you from fully
taxing your hardware
as much as you could so for those
reasons I would just stick to a single
system
I've been streaming off of one rig for
years now with without any issues and
I've even been doing that on you know
quad core i7s not necessarily any
high-end desktop parts required for
something like that
this one says hey Kyle I have a sapphire
r9 390 8 gigabyte paired with an SX
83-70 would I see an increase in game
performance if I upgraded to my C yeah
yep yeah you would I mean to be honest
the bulldozer architecture is so dated
at this point however there are still
games that will utilize all eight of
those bulldozer cores and actually
outperform some rising ships from some
tests that I've seen but for the vast
majority of the time you're gonna get
much higher performance out of a risin
platform at this point it's much newer
Zen architecture and even if you're
getting something with fewer cores like
a rising 5 it's still going to
outperform your 8350 or your 80 370 in
the vast majority of titles I would
suggest going for a risin 5 chip or
higher rising 5 or 7 I would stray away
from rising 3 that would be slightly
more of a lateral upgrade more of a side
grade even though I'm sure in some
instances it would still outperform your
current chip but yeah going for
something like a risin 1500 X or 1600
even would be probably the sweet spot
that I would recommend for your upgrade
and the nice thing about am for about
Rison in that platform is that you have
upgrade ability down the line if you
wanted to swap that out for a 1,700 or
an 8 core 1800 X for example you could
do so without having to change your
motherboard your your D lab and so forth
so alright this is a fun one what was
your reaction when you saw yourself on
PewDiePie's channel it wasn't super
unexpected just because I noticed that a
couple months prior that that twitch
clip is one of the highest watch twitch
clips on the Internet of all time really
I think it's like number 15 or something
like that at least when I checked so it
it's in with like you know all the
youtubers and stuff the mainstream
youtubers they do a lot of reaction
where they react to crazy twitch fails
and things like that side I wasn't
surprised when I was like okay that that
would obviously be an easy target but I
was more surprised by PewDiePie's
reaction to the clip because he was so
like I thought he was just gonna totally
bash me or something like that right but
instead he just he just seems so
concerned like he just seemed genuinely
like I was like oh my gosh this is this
is a maternal side of PewDiePie I didn't
know existed
he's like oh you should really be
wearing protection it was just he was
just super like nice about it which I
think threw me off the most out of out
of everything but it was definitely cool
seeing me on channel the next question
is if we want a media htpc for movies
what's a good car that doesn't require a
second mortgage at this time I'd say a
good card right now that hasn't been
quite as tanked by the current mining
situation is the GTX 1050 it's still
adequate for an HTP see you can even do
some some like 1080p gaming on it to be
honest but it does support 4k it does
support HDR I think I saw a few going
recently for about 150 to 160 bucks
which is still slightly higher than what
they MSRP for I believe but still has
doesn't hold a candle to some of the
other cards out there that have just
doubled or even tripled in price what
was your first custom build my first
custom build was in 2011 which is
actually the year that I started working
at Newegg and just being surrounded by
all the hardware made me really want to
build a system for my first time and
what I ended up getting was a Sandy
Bridge core i7 2668 platform it was an
Asus deluxe p8 z68
and eight gigs of ram ddr3 with a GTX
670 that was also an Asus product it was
a direct cu2 cooler and that was all
inside of the white 600 T from Corsair
beautiful case I actually still have it
in fact it's right there off camera just
chilling there great great little case
with
airflow with those 200 millimeter fans
and I think I had like a hyper 212 like
the original hyper 212 cooling that CPU
which I eventually swapped out for a
liquid a oh so I could be more
overclocking but that was very first one
the very first one all right what is the
oldest PC component you own well
this answer would be really boring since
I did build my first system just seven
years ago which isn't that old all
things considered but wifey sauces dad
daddy sauce I just call them let's let's
not use that I'll call him daddy sauce
for the purpose of this video sent me a
really old floppy drive
I forget how big this floppy is it's
like and also how to eject it aha
there it is look at that thing I don't
know if you guys can see it very well
but um a big old floppy a Maxwell floppy
how much is on this thing doesn't even
say I forget my dad told me once and I
forget a few kilobytes perhaps and then
this is a hard drive isn't it I believe
this is a hard drive I don't know
exactly how much storage is on here but
it's it's not much but there is a molex
connector the only thing that I really
find the only thing that's familiar to
me on this whole thing is is the molex
connector also just goes to show you how
old molex is and that it should die and
no one should ever use it again that is
now the oldest piece of tech that I own
yeah it's very cool coolest thing thanks
dad
thanks daddy sighs all right blast just
final questions for you you just say
daddy sauce again no last question how
do you decide when it's a good time to
upgrade and slash change up a build
I think the first sign that you should
consider upgrading would be that you're
noticing a slowdown of some sort you're
noticing that your performance isn't
what it used to be and it's actually
affecting your workflow or or you know
whatever it is browsing the web you you
notice that things are slowing down and
it's becoming an issue of course there
are other reasons to upgrade for exam
if you wanted to take advantage of
certain features that maybe aren't
offered on your platform because it's an
older platform then that's perhaps a
reason to switch depending on how badly
you need those those those new
technologies and then additionally you
also want to kind of factor in timing
sometimes people buy systems only
researching the hardware that's already
out there not realizing that there's a
big silicon launch right around the
corner and then they end up seeing that
like oh wow
two weeks after I built my whole system
this new GPU came out and it's like way
better price to performance etc so you
have to be also sort of in tune with the
latest trends and be following the news
the tech news closely to know when might
be a good time to pull the trigger on on
certain components well there you go
that's why those where all your
questions are actually the most
interesting ones that we can find you
guys had some good questions this time
around so thank you all for sending
those in will be doing another one of
these probably in the near future
but yeah wifey sauce thank you for
joining me and being a great host and
emcee or whatever you want to call it no
no thank you Wow Wow
all right guys on that note we're gonna
call it a day thank you guys so much for
tuning in be sure to toss a like on the
video if you enjoyed it and get
subscribed to the channel for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon you can
also check us out on floatplane if you
want to watch our content up to a week
early without ads I'll put a link for
that in the description below other than
that guys have a good one and I'll see
y'all in the next video
but I feel really tickled all of our
neighbors are lawyers they're gonna suit
now all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
