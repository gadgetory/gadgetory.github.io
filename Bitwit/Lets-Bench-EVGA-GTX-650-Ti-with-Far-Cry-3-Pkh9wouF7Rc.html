been a while
I've taken a hiatus for a short while
it's been a busy month of December
holidays and all but I'm back I'm back
awesomesauce news is back so the images
you're seeing on screen right now might
look familiar to you if you've already
dived into the wonderful world of far
cry 3 and that's what I'm going to be
playing today but more importantly
ladies and gentlemen I'll be
benchmarking the EVGA GTX 650 Ti video
card while I play this game so this is a
very cinematic moment right here that
you're seeing it's pretty intense makes
me kind of look like a couch potato
quite frankly but I'm not gonna let that
stop me oh whoa oh my god it was all I
it was just a dream on a tablet then
iPad Mini I don't know all right to be
honest guys I have played this before
I've played the first half-hour of this
game I actually played it last night and
I was gonna upload the video last night
but due to my stupidity and in certain
moments of my life I didn't record the
mic audio or I thought I was but it
didn't actually record because of a
bunch of technical crap that I failed to
pay attention to so I'm back again
playing for a second time this guy is
very angry
oh very angry that's unnecessary
language I'm not but I am playing this
game for a second time but other than
that this is the first time I've ever
played the Far Cry series I am a
complete stranger to the first two and
so that's that's why this should be
quite an adventure for me and a new
experience
glad you guys are here with me because
this guy is really freaking me out the
thing is where you up in the fucking
skies you thought you had your finger on
the
I'm gonna push you
guy guys not have very much hospitality
points yes thank you sir that's
well-dressed much much better dress than
this dude over here who's being very
rude I think you're so cool yeah walk
away that's right all right so this guy
is my brother I don't want to spoil
anything but this is my brother and he's
about to get free right there
he's pretty badass for a while so let's
just let you see what happens for the
record while all this is going on I'm
currently running at 1920 by 1080 and
I'm on medium settings right now medium
video settings and I have I think 2x
MSAA anti-aliasing on and I am running
at a steady 30
I shouldn't say steady I'm running at
about 30 frames a seconds and that's
give or take 5 frames so sometimes it
dips a little bit below that sometimes
it goes a little up oh oh right bro
score was a good one thank god you're
from the army thank God I have a
military soldier on my team right now I
could not do this alone so that's just a
brief brief description of what I'm
playing at right now
and when I was playing yesterday I was
getting you know a pretty average frame
rate of about thirty 30-plus frames per
second which is very playable I know
some of you were gonna gonna gripe and
complain dirty frame me but I actually
had a pretty fluid experience with it
and I didn't I didn't see a problem
there was a bit of artifacts
I saw a few artifacts during my gameplay
but not too many overall was pretty
smooth experience just a testament to
the performance offered by the EVGA 650
CI it's good little card and might I say
it does win the award for cutest
graphics card of all time at least on
the market right now it's just so gosh
darn cute it's like six and a half
inches I think and it I just want to
cuddle with it Punky's and their
pitbulls who are totally unto me but
their owners are too stupid to realize
it thank God
the dogs aren't in charge am i right
bacon beefy
eight crouching with the slow
hello we're later can smoke some stores
now
now kinda reminds me of Shiva looks like
Shiva from Resident Evil 4 kind of does
look like her hometown doesn't it hey I
gotta throw a rock yes
my first superpower rocks
he had take that oh yeah you're supposed
to open this for me Oh God
was I supposed to not go in there mm oh
god yeah
score brah Jay look at me freaking out
man without you so pull it together you
could totally do this without me you've
been taking out fools left and right and
I've just been standing here crying like
a little well you know you're totally
fine brah
Oh God oh my god I didn't see this last
time no not all of them this is where
all the moat does that you missed
somebody a good tree alright don't throw
another Rock right here what's happening
Rock attack wonder what'd happen if I
just threw rocks at them I grew a rock
at their head
Oh stay low
by the way I'm at 30 37 frames per
second right now update I feel like I'm
in the beginning the opening scene of
inglorious basterds right now and one of
the Jews underneath the Ford floorboards
not a good situation to be in
I promised that I'd take care of you two
we're gonna find him we're gonna free
the others we're going home
oh my gosh space stay with me I already
know what happens here so I'm not even
gonna hold space I'm just gonna let him
die sorry bro
your fate has been determined by the
game developers we're just getting to
know you thanks though you got me this
far this guy's a wily fellow isn't he
okay
sprint sprint sprint oh come on
what I really want to turn around just
see what's behind me but I have a
feeling if I do I'm just gonna die
instantly like insta death keep running
just keep running just keep running
oh this part freaked me out last time
freaking bear dude not cool I'm UPSI
vines
all right checkpoint that's good points

that freaked me out
canines on my tail rostov a professor
across the river don't look down don't
look down oh my god
Oh a it's just a chopper with turrets on
it
no big I got it no I don't got it
totally don't and so has begun folks my
journey into the world of far cry 3 Oh
Oh Saviour who could it be 60 frames per
second oh my god I'm getting 60 frames
per second just kidding
of the jungle follow the path find the
answers
mmm-hmm freaky voodoo doll I hope that's
not a good all of me because he's
hanging from his neck Oh Samuel Jackson
what the hell are you doing here drug
dealer I don't like it
it is brave to swim a storm but to
sunbathe on a beach with pirates
I was not sunbathing okay oh I will also
take yours
okay and I probably will leave you the
hell alone then Jason mm-hmm kill him
kill him now we give you a blade now's
your chance all right so did I already
have those tattoos before he found me or
did he like give me tattoos while I was
passed out because if those tattoos
really mean that I'm some kind of badass
warrior I'm not buying it come with me I
was just being a little worse five
minutes ago not sure who gave me those
tattoos when I was passed out drunk
going to free free me Dennis
do you thang do whatever it is you do
it is it is definitely something crap I
didn't escape I the bridge broke and I
dropped a thousand feet I should be dead
right now
don't celebrate seemed like a pretty
stand-up dude Dennis I'm not gonna lie
you are slowly gaining my respect what's
going on here yeah there's something
like 12 but what do you mean why not
choose oh come on
Dennis oh yeah that's great I hope she's
18 you're sick bastards
oh but you will what do they say in
America there's a first time for
everything say I predicted that no I'm
just kidding because I played it
yesterday so I already now yeah all
right let's go buy a gun let's get some
good yeah yeah san it equip equip to the
slap do it
yep it's equipped good stuff lady
think all games that have vehicles on
them oh I'm totally hitting this guy
yeah screw you cow so you get for not
looking both ways forget what I was
saying is I think all video games that
have people give the option to have
radios that you can change the stations
and stuff like GTA I think that is a
thing you know it's 2012 it's time
Center that happens across all games but
okay I'm supposed to gather some stuff
to kill some boar where to boar action
at
tasty mmm beefy all right let's roll
baby Hennis I've got the plants and
animals
good then bend nature to your wing I
will teach you show me your ways craft
doing it and you see plant you found
craft two syringes do it select phone
it's ringing
but I will not answer it craft good
craft began you may even find more
powerful plants out in the woods if you
are lucky now use the skins of the
animals you killed to enlarge what you
can carry crafting will allow you to
carry more weapons money loot and
syringes yes one last thing the tattoo
on your arm it is a sign that you are
special soul of a warrior you progressed
along the path let me show you how to
add to them with each turtle a skill is
much higher yes you can choose to learn
skills you've got three different kind
of classes I guess you say these three
different classes and each one has a
skill tree so we've got the Heron
long-range takedowns and mobility want
to attack your enemies from afar and
you've got the shark which is the sole
takedowns and healing a little bit up
close and personal that healing spec
there and then you've got the spider
stealth takedowns and survival
so looks like he wants me to set this
one up he's gonna be doing takedown
this is a pretty common move in this
game from what I've seen in gameplay
videos sneaking up behind the enemy and
basically stabbing them from behind and
this is also good because as you take
out enemy camps you actually get more
experience if you take out an enemy camp
without being detected
so obviously you get rewarded for being
stealthy and for you know when
preventing from enemies from sending off
the alarm I'm spotting you so that is a
very handy move to have in this game I'm
also going to learn this sprint slide
Cheryl really let's find out what that
is later
check out my cellphone my camo 4G oh
what's that baby oh that doesn't sound
good
who have like some kinky stuff going on
over there have to get her back got to
get her back
I missed my kinky nights all right let's
roll Dennis let's do some work it's
beautiful day out
Oh also another grep about video games
in general is why is what every person
that drives in a game even when they're
driving straight pulls they're always
moving the wheel back and forth like
that it doesn't make any sense
can't we just you know face reality and
make them control the steering wheel
like a normal person because right now
we would be swerving we totally be
swarming right now that's really what he
was doing
so game developers take note you can
even have to give me credit for giving
you this these words of wisdom I just
totally gonna use my take down move on
you guys all right so this guy looks the
most open died
oh my god of course I would run out of
ammo right there dead that guy's dead Oh
probably stay down Oh downed our game I
am shaking you die there you go
that's a homie
oh my gosh no I'm Adam mo no that's not
cool I don't like that can I jump over
this over running running away oh we got
him
I was I was totally gonna take down that
guy I had them all I didn't need help
thanks though guys totally had that on
my own that's cool so that was obviously
a very easy introductory enemy base camp
supposed to rescue my friend here
Oh bummer
could have guessed that your princess is
in another castle they've been doing it
for years
I would definitely take that laptop
though um but hey you know what that's I
think that's gonna conclude this video
guys I've been playing for about I want
to say 25 to 35 minutes and I think
that's ample time to give a fair reading
on performance of this card once again
this has been the EVGA GTX 650 Ti and
we've been playing far cry 3 thanks a
lot for watching and here are your
benchmarks
