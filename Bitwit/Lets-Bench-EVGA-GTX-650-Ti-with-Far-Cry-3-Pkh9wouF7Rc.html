been a while I've taken a hiatus for a
short while it's been a busy month or
December holidays and all but I'm back
I'm back awesomesauce news is back so
the images you're seeing on screen right
now might look familiar to you if you've
already dived into the wonderful world
of far cry 3 and that's what I'm going
to be playing today but more importantly
ladies and gentlemen I'll be
benchmarking the EVGA gtx 650ti video
card while I play this game so this is a
very cinematic moment right here that
you're saying it's pretty intense makes
me kind of look like a couch potato
quite frankly but I'm not gonna let that
stop me oh whoa oh my god it was all a
lie it was just a dream on a tablet then
ipad mini i don't know i like this phone
all right to be honest guys i have
played this before i put the first half
hour of this game i actually played it
last night and I was gonna upload the
video last night but due to my stupidity
and in certain moments in my life I
didn't record the mic audio or I thought
I was but it didn't actually record
because of a bunch of technical crap
that I failed to pay attention to so I'm
back again playing for a second time
this guy is very angry oh very angry
that's unnecessary language I'm not you
don't even talk like that but I am
playing this game for a second time but
other than that this is the first time
I've ever played the Far Cry series I am
complete stranger to the first two and
so that's that's why this should be
quite an adventure for me in a new
experience what is
glad you guys are here with me cuz this
guy is really freaking me out you see
the thing is up there way you up in the
fucking skies you thought you had your
finger on the pussy trip but at mono now
here
down here
Wow
okay I'm gonna chill more relaxed with
you sky guess not okay brother have very
much hospitality points I must say stop
scaring the hostages yes thank you sir
that's well-dressed Fox more innovative
much much better dressed than this dude
over here with being very rude I think
you're so cool yeah walk away that's
right alright so this guy is my brother
I don't wanna spoil anything but this is
my brother and he's about to get free
right there he's pretty badass for a
while so let's just let you see what
happens for the record while all this is
going on I'm currently running at 1920 x
1080 and I'm on medium settings right
now medium video settings and I have I
think 2x msaa anti-aliasing on and I am
running at a steady 30 I shouldn't say
steady I'm running at about 30 frames of
seconds and that's give or take five for
a nice so sometimes it dips a little bit
below that sometimes it goes a little up
oh alright bro score was a good one is
what they teach you in the army thank
god you're from the army thank God I
have a military soldier on my team right
now I could not do this alone so that's
just a brief brief description of what
I'm playing at right now
and when i was playing yesterday i was
getting yeah a pretty average frame rate
of about thirty 30 plus frames per
second which is very playable I know
some of you are gonna gonna gripe and
complain to me and dirty thing it's me
but I actually had a pretty fluid
experience with it and I didn't I didn't
see a problem there was a bit of
artifacts I saw a few artifacts here in
my gameplay but not too many overall was
pretty smooth experience just a
testament to the performance offered by
the EVGA 650ti it's good little card and
might I say it does win the award for
cutest graphics card of all time at
least on the market right now it's just
so gosh darn cute it's like six and a
half inches I think and oh it I just
want to cuddle with it look right now
trying to avoid all these little honkies
and their pit bulls who are totally unto
me but their owners are too stupid to
realize it thank God the dogs aren't in
charge am i right mmm bacon beefy
to put it 18 crouching with you slow
hello hello stop here sometime poet got

did they say in America there's a first
time for everything if say I predicted
that no I'm just kidding because I
played it yesterday so I already now
yeah all right let's go buy a gun let's
get some goods yeah I'm also good yeah
give me that good yeah it's a good gun
yeah sanit equip Krypton the slap they
do it yep it's equipped radio towers
online yeah
me my friend good good stuff lady
think all games that have vehicles on
them oh I'm totally hitting this guy
yeah screw you cow so you get for not
looking both ways yeah what i was saying
is i think all video games that have
vehicles give the option to have radios
that you can change the stations and
stuff like GTA i think that is a thing
you know it's 2012 it's time sender that
happens across all games but ok i'm
supposed to gather some stuff to kill
some boar we're tube or action at yes
all right yes do this I've got you hello
all right
tasty mmm mmm beefy all right let's roll
baby hennes got the plants and animals
good then bend nature to your wing I
will teach you show me your ways
crafting it Luc plunge you found craft
two syringes do it select phone is
ringing but I will not answer it craft
good craft began you may even find more
powerful plants out in the woods if you
are lucky now use the skins of the
animals you killed to enlarge what you
can carry crafting will allow you to
carry more weapons money loot and
syringes yes one last thing the tattoo
on your arm it is a sign that you are
special you were soul of a warrior you
progressed along the path let me show
you how to add to them with each to tow
a skill is must ah yes you can choose to
learn skills in server and idiots you've
got three different with the tongue kind
of classes I guess you could say these
three different classes and each one has
a skill tree so we've got the heron
long-range takedowns and mobility want
to attack your enemies from afar and
you've got the shark which is assault
takedowns and healing a little bit up
close and personal that healing spec
there and you've got the spider stealth
takedowns and survival so looks like he
wants me to set this one up he's going
to be doing take down this is pretty
common move in this game from Jews what
I've seen in gameplay videos sneaking up
behind the enemy and basically stabbing
them from behind
and this is also good because as you
take out enemy camps you actually get
more experience if you take out an enemy
camp without being detected so obviously
you get rewarded for being stealthy and
for you know when preventing from
enemies from sending off the alarm I'm
spotting you so that is a very handy
move to have in this game I'm also going
to learn this sprint slide she'll
probably let that time that with that is
later check out my cell phone my camo 4G
oh what's that baby oh that doesn't
sound good who have like some kinky
stuff going on over they have to get her
back got to get her back fun i miss my
kinky nights all right let's roll Venice
let's do some work it's beautiful day
out for a killing what's this outpost
they've taken Lisa to the outpost our
strongholds found throughout Rock Island
buses pirates hold them to control the
surrounding area
so we're heading into oh also another
graph about video games in general is
why is what every person that drives in
a game even when they're driving
straight pulls they're always moving the
wheel back and forth like that it
doesn't make any sense can't we just you
know face reality and make them control
the steering wheel like a normal person
because right now we would be swerving
we totally be swerving right now that's
really what he was doing so game
developers take note really bad you can
give you have to give me credit for
giving you this these words of wisdom I
just want to save Lisa and like friends
we just sneak up on these guys totally
gonna use my takedown move on you guys
alright so this guy looks the most open
die oh my god of course I would run out
of ammo right there dead that guy's dead
Oh should probably stay down Oh down da
game I am shaking you died there you go
oh that's a homie
oh my gosh no I'm Adam mo no that's not
cool I don't like that can I jump over
this hump over running running away oh
we got him I was I was totally gonna
take down that guy I had them all I
didn't need help thanks though guys
totally had that on my own that's cool
so that was obviously a very easy
introductory enemy base camp supposed to
rescue my friend here
oh here bummer could I guess that your
princess is in another castle they've
been doing it for years I would
definitely take that laptop though um
but hey you know what that's I think
that's going to conclude this video guys
I've been playing for about I want to
say 25 to 35 minutes and i think that's
ample time to give a fair reading on
performance of this card once again this
has been the EVGA GTG tx650 TI and we've
been playing far cry 3 thanks a lot for
watching and here are your benchmarks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
