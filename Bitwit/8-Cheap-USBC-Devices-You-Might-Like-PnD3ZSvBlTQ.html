what's happened in people welcome back
to the channel hope you're all doing
well today and I'm taking a look at a
smorgasbord of USB type-c products these
are devices accessories etc that we're
gonna be taking a closer look at today I
pretty much just bought all of these on
Amazon I'll put links in the description
below in case you're interested but
these weren't really purchased based off
of anything more than user reviews I
tried to pick out all the ones that
seemed to have high ratings and just
personal interests things that happen to
pique my interest
I felt like hey this might be kind of
interesting to showcase to you guys so
that's we're gonna be taking a look at
today the reason why we're doing this
video in the first place is because USB
type-c while it is still far away from
becoming the universal mainstream USB
interface I mean it still has a long way
to go before it replaces micro USB for
example it is still becoming
increasingly popular especially here at
the end of 2017 where we're seeing more
devices than ever supporting this new
interface such as your smartphone Google
pixel that I have here as a USB type-c
phone it's also wiggled its way into
laptops especially those supporting
Thunderbolt 3 which is a super versatile
technology we'll take a closer look at
that later on and motherboards I mean
we've got motherboard USB 3.1 type C
headers now I'm just natively baked in
as well as we're starting to see more
and more type C front panel on mid-tower
and full tower cases so it's super
exciting this should give you guys a
pretty good idea of what sort of type C
devices you can start using now as we
sort of witness the wider spread
adoption of this new interface so on
that note let's dive right in and see
what we have in store so here we have a
USB charging cable try to contain your
excitement but but know this is actually
kind of cool hear me out on this first
we've got a USB type a connection on one
end and a magnetic tip with just some
electronic pins on the other and this
actually includes three individual tips
or connections that you can pop on and
off at
your leisure we've got a lightning
connector for your Apple devices micro
USB and USB type-c just pop it on it's
magnetic
super cool I guess the idea here is that
it's super versatile you only have to
have one cable and yet it can support
three different connections the downfall
here that I'm seeing is that no one's
gonna carry around all three of these
heads on them at any time they're pretty
much gonna use the one connection that
they prefer and it's gonna stay that way
or they're gonna end up losing the other
two because they're so tiny didn't come
with like a pouch or anything so really
the main selling point for me here isn't
versatility the flexibility but rather
ease of use because with I mean type-c
for starters in its defense is already
as good as it gets when it comes to just
how easy it is to plug something in it's
reversible it's nice and wide it's
fairly large much bigger than micro USB
and you wouldn't really think that
there'd be a need to make the connection
process for this interface any easier
but that being said if you pop in the
connection into your phone for example
connecting is pretty much as easy as
putting the cable within proximity of
the the magnet and there you go I could
see this being really useful if you're
one of those people who has like a car
mount like a windshield mount for your
phone in your car obviously you can
pretty much just keep this plug in there
24/7 if you wanted to and if you have
one of these cables in your car when
it's time to connect you pretty much
just put it up there there's no force or
pressure that you have to exert that
goes and connects really easily it's a
pretty strong magnet it will pull out
the connection or it usually does pull
out the connection if you just pull it
straight back like that type-c header
came along with it
but you can easily just pull the cable
quickly or at an angle if you want to
keep that magnetic tip inside of your
phone at all times it features a three
point three foot braided nylon cable so
it doesn't get snagged very easily it's
very soft to the touch and fairly high
quality and finally it does have an
activity LED on the magnetic end so you
know when the cables in use next up
we've got the SanDisk Ultra dual Drive
this is a 128 gigabyte model that I
picked up for 36 bucks
although the capacities range anywhere
from 32 to 256 gigs has sort of a
lightweight construction with either
metal or aluminum and plastic I can't
tell if it's metal or aluminum but at
any rate it feels sturdy enough it's the
quality is nothing to write
about it's pretty typical from what
you'll find on most SanDisk products but
it doesn't feel like it's gonna break in
your hand the day you get it either it's
incredibly small and portable which is
why I appreciate the fact we've got some
keyring holes although I wish they were
a little bigger I feel like a full sized
keyring would be hard pressed to fit
inside of here what I like about this
drive is that it has dual retracting
connectors so you've got USB type-c on
one end and type-a on the other
depending on how you switch it and this
is going to be supporting USB 3.1 gen2
only five gigabits per second here
unfortunately but it is hitting the
advertised speeds of 150 megabytes per
second reads and I believe it was
getting around 60 to 70 megabytes per
second right so not too terrible
honestly for the price it's a fantastic
little drive and I would highly
recommend this honestly I'll probably be
putting it on my own keys when I get a
chance
lastly in case you guys were wondering
yes this does support OTG or on-the-go
technology with supported devices so if
I had my pixel to here I could pop this
guy in and pretty much watch any movies
or listen to any music that are saved on
the flash drive straight on my smart
phone moving on we have a five and one
USB type-c adapter this is gonna be a
great accessory for those of you who are
on the go who have a laptop with a Type
C connection obviously we have type-c
connector on one end looks to be
gold-plated and that's actually attached
to this short cable relatively short
cable that is not detachable I'd
actually prefer it that way for smaller
accessories like this so you don't
accidentally bring the hub and forget
the cable at home you never find
yourself Sol in that regard on the hub
itself we get two USB 3.0 type-a ports
that support both charging and data
transfer alongside that some card
readers for SD micro SD + TF cards and
finally an HDMI out that's capable of
outputting up to 4k I believe it's at 30
Hertz however because I would assume
that this is an HDMI 1.4 port altogether
a nice little device it's made of an
aluminium alloy fairly lightweight again
super portable easy to just sort of
throw in your backpack and go now if you
happen to be a proud m2 nvme SSD owner
and your old m2 SATA base Drive has been
sitting there collecting dust this
product might help you repurpose that
for better use this is the Wii me m2
SATA based external enclosure that helps
you convert and end up to SATA based SSD
into an external
flashdrive it's fairly straightforward
there's a PCB inside of here with an
MDOT to be key mounts so only be key
SSDs will work fortunately it does
support the full gamut of 30 40 to 60
and 80 millimeter drives but again it's
only gonna work with SATA based I'm
about to drive so don't bother putting
an nvme drive in here once you screw it
down to the PCB you pretty much slide
that back to the enclosure and tighten
it up with the two included screws the
enclosure itself has a type-c connector
that supports USB 3.1 gen2 it when you
plug in the included cable which is also
just a really nice length it's a very
sturdy solid cable as well with a type-a
connection at the other end it does
support trim and you asp which are
fantastic features to have for a device
like this now I know what you guys are
thinking Kyle what's with all this USB
3.1 gen2 C the gen 2 stuff give it to me
I hear you I hear you fellas and ladies
any ladies out there maybe ok no it's
cool so for all you gen 2 fanatics out
there this may interest you it's
basically a simple expansion card that
outputs to a pair of USB type-c 3.1 gen2
ports capable of outputting 5 volts and
2 amps this thing is absolutely
fantastic has a really nice kind of
black sort of powder-coated finish here
on the on the expansion slot if they
also included a low-profile half-height
slot so if you have like an older PC or
like a server-based like a slim slim
case or something like that you could
use this for that as well it's also
fairly inexpensive how much did I pay
for this thing 20 bucks
honestly not too bad at all and again no
additional power required it gets all of
its juice from either an X 4 X 8 or x16
slot on your motherboard supports all
the way back to PCIe Gen 1 and overall
just a nice little unit a very simple
straightforward and affordable solution
to expanding the USB type-c connectivity
on your system now most of the products
we've talked about so far kind of
celebrate the adoption of USB type-c but
if we're being honest with ourselves
it's still a long ways off from becoming
the mainstream USB interface so for that
reason alone you should be prepared for
situations where type C isn't available
to you when you desperately need it me
for example I have a Google pixel 2 with
a type-c connector
for charging and whenever I go somewhere
I usually have a type c2c cable on me
but not everywhere I go actually has a
type C supported charger whether it be a
wall adapter or someone's laptop or
computer type-c ports just aren't
available very much right now so for
that reason I picked up this mini type C
female 2 USB type a male adapter to sort
of fix that issue it supports 5 amp
charging and data transfer it's made of
aluminium alloy and all that jazz I mean
at the end of the day though it's just a
simple adapter that I feel every avid
type C user should have in their arsenal
you know what I like even more than that
adapter though these adapters these
adapters are awesome this is a micro USB
female 2 types email and the reason why
this rocks is because I guarantee you if
I ever went over a family members house
or a friend's house none of them would
have anything that I could use to charge
my Google pixel or any type C device for
that matter they probably don't even
know what it looks like but this is
great because I guarantee you they would
all at least have a couple micro USB
cables because it's just so widely
adopted at this point and with one of
these especially the fact that it's
keychain means you'll never leave home
without it it can just be on you 24/7
it's gonna be a complete lifesaver I'm
planning to put one of these on my
personal keychain as soon as this video
is over because I know sooner or later
I'm gonna have to use it and it's
fantastic build quality even the chains
really not too bad even if it does
happen to break off or something like
that it comes in a four pack so you have
plenty of backups and last but certainly
not least is this USB C triple display
docking station from the folks over at
pluggable this thing's super cool
because it sort of showcases the full
extent of what USB C is capable of
especially when you pair it with a
technology like Thunderbolt 3 it really
opens up a lot of possibilities for
example if you have a supported
Thunderbolt 3 Type C laptop you could
take a single USBC cable run it from
that laptop to the docking station here
and from there you have a wide list of
various IO that you can connect to for
starters at the front you get mic and
headphone jacks those are both 3.5
millimeter a single USB 3.0 type a and
type C port at the front on the back
side you get an additional three USB 3
type-a ports gigabit ethernet ports and
three
video outputs two of these ports can
handle either 1080 at 60 Hertz or 2560
by 1440 at 50 Hertz the second HDMI port
that has the white background can output
4k at 30 Hertz unfortunately it doesn't
do 60 Hertz that would have been nice
but again this isn't really targeted at
enthusiast gamers or anything this is
more for productivity and web browsing
and things like that the docking station
also provides up to 60 watts of power
which means it can actually charge your
laptop while it's being connected
without any additional AC adapters I
mean let this all sink in for a second
guys a single USBC cable is driving
three displays one of which is at 4k a
multitude of USB 3 devices sound and
it's charging your laptop all at the
same time I mean if you're looking to
convert your laptop into the most
desktop like experience save for you
know any gaming capabilities really then
this is pretty much the product that you
want and I really haven't seen too many
alternatives like it that have been
reviewed quite as highly so again guys
