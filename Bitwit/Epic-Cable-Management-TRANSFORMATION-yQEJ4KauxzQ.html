think it can be a game-changer like it
50 bucks Kyle focus isn't AMD rising
just the best Kyle focus oh yeah hold on
let me fix that here we go
damn it over here sexy Kyle focus got it
that's okay I'll just
Netflix while you guys chill the Focus G
from Frank will design is a new budget
case done right click the link in the
description for more info what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well today we've got
some fun exciting things that we're
gonna do not terribly exciting but
fairly cool I'm excited we're actually
gonna be doing some cable management on
not computers like the one wifey sauce
is building right now in the background
say hi honey hi but cable management
rather for the desk set up the sort of
gaming area that I have set up so far so
here's a preliminary look at it and
here's the awful entrails that are just
hanging out of the bottom it looks
pretty pretty god-awful so what we're
gonna be doing is cleaning up all the
cable mess that's underneath these
tables here with the help of some IKEA
hardware we've got the Signum if I
remember correctly this product has been
heavily popularized by a lot of those
set up channels other tech channels such
as random Frank P Tech source and those
guys awesome people this seems to be a
pretty straightforward and sweet product
as well easy to install looks like
there's only a couple screws thank God
because this is Ikea stuff and you know
how that goes so basically we've got
these three trays that will be mounted
to the bottom of our desks here sorry
for the shakiness Chris the intern is
not here today so I'm doing all the
filming myself so you've got a tray
that's gonna go more or less gonna hover
just beneath the table here towards the
back of the desk so it's out of sight
out of mind and they were probably gonna
put a power strip in each of them maybe
two if we need them and and that'll be
that will tuck away all the cables way
up there so if you're standing you're
standing in the room there's just no
possible way that you'll even know the
cables are there unless you know you
went down here and took a sharp angle
but for the most parts we've got three
of these guys they'll be going on this
desk that desk in that desk we don't
really need one for this one this is
like the presenting table Paul and I do
awesome hardware I'll just run like a
line on Tuesdays whenever we need to
hook up our laptops in this area but for
the most part these three desks that are
facing the walls will be nice and tidy
all around and then finally the other
thing that we're doing today really
quick simple installation you've got
this RGB LED strip kit from I don't know
some Chinese company we've got a couple
meters to work with here so I'm I'm
bettin that we have enough length to run
it again behind all three of these desks
that are touching the walls so we can
pretty much just do an all-encompassing
LED strip running across the whole thing
kind of similar to Paul from Paul's
hardware I really do admire his garage
set up that he set up over the years so
I'm kind of gonna emulate that with some
LED strips give it a little bit more
color in the shops in the back
background of the videos and things like
that so that should be pretty fun it's
gonna be a pretty straightforward simple
video guys nothing too crazy but let's
go ahead and get started with I guess
we'll start off with the cable
management stuff first
oh really quick before we get around to
Signum I actually have to replace these
panels with these guys these are the
asus rog Strix PG three for eight you
guys know them you'll love them if you
don't that you should they're really
awesome monitors they are the 34 40 by
1440 curved ultra wide g-sync 100 hertz
displays magnus yeah it's gonna be super
sweet this is an awesome setup for
editing because you've got a 4k panel
here 60 Hertz vertical oriented one over
there but I'm not gonna be doing any
editing in this room in fact all my
editing stuff from the editing station
is gonna be on the other side of this
wall in the other suite that we have so
this is really just I want to make this
thing a gamers Haven more or less so
we've already got sort of a nice gaming
system here and this whole area this
whole setup is subject to change I don't
know if I'm gonna replace this with a
different system if this keyboard is
gonna stay if this mouse is gonna stay
so there's there's a lot of things that
are just sort of up in the air
I'm sort of figuring it out as I go
along but one thing is for sure is that
I'm gonna be installing these two panels
today and then once those are installed
then it makes more sense to to move onto
the cable management so on that notes
ladies and gentlemen start your engines
because we're about to tie up some
cables there's no way that I can make
that sound exciting
all right so here we are several hours
later and there's a significant lack of
cables underneath the tables it rhymes
so it must be true oh yeah we take a
little deep a little dive deeper you can
see that there's definitely a bunch of
cables stashed up in this in this tray
in particular we haven't yet added any
to that one but we soon we soon will and
then the third one over here is starting
to get filled up as well but overall
installation was fairly simple and the
results are totally worth it everything
above the desk looks pretty sexy too
especially then PG three four eight my
goodness now the reason why this one is
off ASIS actually forgot to include a
power brick with with that unit so this
one was totally fine
got the power brick for that one only
half the power brick for this one only
via the AC cord but missing the actual
brick which is too unfortunate this is
this wasn't a retail model though it
looked like it had been like a sort of a
recycled review sample so don't worry if
you're buying this retail I'm sure it's
gonna come with a power brick just fine
I think just something got mishandled
when it was transferring hands to me so
but that's okay I'm gonna hit a source
up and try to get one of those in here
soon enough so we can actually get a
full spread boom boom oh and you can't
ignore the super useless but totally
awesome LED logo that's just being shot
out of this monitors but onto the desk
looks super cool and some of the things
to note here I did install my little
hook a little hooky guy it's not quite
the the really popular one that everyone
uses but it's very similar it's not
rubber it's sort of aluminum so it's
really lightweight but it's got 3m and
it comes 3m tape it's got some screw
holes too though if you want to really
get it in there it does just fine
carrying the Boyd Pro RGB Wireless from
Corsair and I did want to say that I did
gypped I did test some zip ties for our
power strip here there's a zip tie there
and a zip tie here and then the cord
wasn't quite long enough to actually lay
flat across the the ground there but
that's okay because I think I'm gonna
put a mini-fridge I'm thinking I'm being
dead serious right here I'm gonna put a
mini fridge to the right of this table
which will totally cover up this this
nasty cable here so that should be
totally fine mini fridge because awesome
hardware because Paul and I need beer
and we need it fast
mini-fridge is gonna go right there
maybe I'll I don't know maybe I'll put a
computer inside of it because why the
hell not at this point how about them
RGB LEDs now you'll notice that I only
have the LEDs behind this desk I don't
have RGB LEDs anywhere else like I
initially planned and that is because
I'm an idiot and completely overlooked
the fact that these are all separate
tables so that wouldn't really work to
have just one continuous strip there was
no way to chain them now the LED kit
that I bought did come with a second
spool so I put that one along this desk
right here but I was unable to power it
up because the kit only included one of
these little DC power bricks so until I
get another one its lights out for that
desk but it should be pretty sweet once
they're both synched up I think the next
plan of attack here is to find some
artwork or posters or something for this
just barren these barren walls it's just
white it's just white for days I want to
switch it up and not just put you know
more computers and monitors on the wall
I want something a little bit different
maybe a little less digital a little
more analog you guys have any ideas
though of what should go on these walls
please let me know in the comments cuz I
don't really know but anyway guys I'm
gonna close things out it's about 9:00
