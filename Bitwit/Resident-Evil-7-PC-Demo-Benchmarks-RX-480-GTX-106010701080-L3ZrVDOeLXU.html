at the Resident Evil 7 demo beginning
hour which made its debut on the PC just
earlier this week up until now the free
to play half an hour ish thrill ride has
only been playable on ps4 and more
recently Xbox one so being a fan of the
franchise myself I was pretty pumped to
be given a taste of the reimagined
nightmare and to see how Capcom's new re
engine responds to a variety of modern
video cards in a Windows 10 desktop
environment but the full games arrival
just a month away today's test should
give us a pretty good idea of what kind
of gaming performance we can expect on
our machines without even looking at the
benchmarks though the game is already
shaping up to be a promising release for
PC judging from the healthy number of
graphical settings in the demo including
vsync uncapped framerate ambient
occlusion chromatic aberration and much
more to push the limits of our GPUs and
because it makes the game look horrific
ly beautiful maximum quality settings
and all the eye candy effects were
enabled for these runs the combination
of FX AAA and taa was used to process
anti-aliasing and SSAO was the technique
of choice for ambient occlusion the four
cards in our lineup are reference models
running at reference speeds and they
include the AMD rx 488 gigabyte version
Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1066 gigabyte model
the gtx 1070 and the gtx 1080
clean installs of the latest crimson
Reliv driver version 16 12.1 and wickel
driver 370 6.33 were conducted free
benchmarking as well as for the rest of
our testing hardware my haswell-e test
bed is still fitted with the same asus
strix gaming x99 motherboard and 32 gig
kit of g.skill tried NZ ddr4 but the 10
core 6950 ex that once resided and it's
now betrayed socket has since moved into
hot line leaving us with a worthless
eight core 59 60 ex just kidding this is
still a stupid powerful CPU and it's
been overclocked to 40 500 megahertz
with the help of a corsair h 100 i GTX
v2 now I decided to run each of these
cards in three common sixteen by nine
resolutions including 1920 by 1080 2560
by 1440 and 3840 by 2160 a
a4k at least for the demo the game does
not currently support ultra-wide but
hopefully that comes with the full
release as this is exactly the kind of
eerie atmosphere that thrill-seekers
want wrapped around the retinas
like most demos there's no built-in
benchmark here so I kept my testing
methodology super simple to avoid much
variable interference starting the
framerate recorder once the opening
title fades away I navigate to the back
door at the other end of the house turn
around and simply walk back to where I
started again I kept this super simple
so you guys could try this yourselves at
home on your own machines and compare
your results to the ones you're about to
see with the settings we're using
there's some really great shadows and
lighting afoot in this short little run
especially in the kitchen though I
wouldn't trust anything in the fridge on
a side note the photorealistic
renderings of the re engine also looked
fantastic
texture detail and lifelike faces really
bring a heightened sense of reality when
combined with the first-person
perspective all of which breathed new
life into the franchise as far as bugs
are concerned the only ones I found were
the roaches in this pot hopefully a good
sign that points to a smooth day one
launched on PC on that note let's see if
our test subjects here managed to
perform better under pressure than I did
which I suppose isn't saying much
so apparently the re engine has allowed
this game to be very scalable and well
optimized for these carts it also finds
a way to bring forth a ton of on-screen
detail without sacrificing much
performance with our mid-range GPUs
yielding averages well above 100 FPS at
1080p the likelihood of budget gamers
being able to jump in on the
bone-chilling action with the GTX 1050
Ti or something like an rx 470 seems
very high 4k gamers can rejoice too as
the GTX 1080 averages 63 FPS which is a
very playable framerate at Ultra HD I
personally don't mind this game at 60
Hertz because it gravitates towards a
slower and more calculated style of
gameplay as opposed to its last couple
predecessors at least from what I've
gathered in the demo by the way here's
an overall look at the scores you just
saw unsurprisingly the gtx 1070 and 1080
are in a league of their own but did you
guys notice how the RX for 80 edges out
the gtx 1060 on every run AMD has been
hard at work on their new real live
drivers and it appears to be paying off
beautifully the RX 480 s larger frame
buffer also gives it a big leg up here
as the demo turned out to be quite the
vram monster
eating up all six gigs of the gtx 1060
at 1080p the takeaway here is if you
have a GPU with less than 6 gigs be
prepared to dial down your graphical
settings to keep frame rates in check
apart from demanding lots of memory the
re 7 demo ran like butter on every card
I tested and was delightful to play
through as it was disturbing sensible
keybindings no glitches and graphical
settings galore really allowed me to
soak up the game's atmosphere to its
fullest without any distractions leaving
the anxious to continue my nail-biting
boot shaking but clenching exploration
come January assuming I don't chicken
out but that's gonna do it for now guys
before you go let me know in the
comments if you're excited for this new
direction the franchise is headed and
what you thought of the pc demo assuming
you've had a chance to try it out also
let me know what you thought of the
content for today's video if you're not
into the Resident Evil saga at all did
you still find it interesting or did I
just waste precious minutes of your life
that you'll never get back either way
let me know if you'd like to see more of
the
ready for PC types of videos where I
test out up-and-coming PC games your
feedback is always appreciated as always
thank you guys for watching subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already and
I'll see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
