it it is quite stinky this is a guy
making it right now looks like you know

stringy
avocado yeah all right let me let me try
it out how do you even eat this I mean
yeah I just a small bite you don't need
a big bite movie by working all right
here we go
satisfies anyone says
does that it was the same as they say no
it's interesting yeah it's almost like
it tastes like two completely different
flavors at the same time and and one of
those flavors is really good and fruity
the other one is kind of like the like
somewhat like an onion it's hard to
describe but it's really kind of
off-putting I could see that I can get
behind it though it is very creamy not
as bad as everyone says
give it a shot Taiwanese kitty

something Brandon and it was the only
job alright so right now we are in jail
fen which is a pretty awesome little
neighborhood and it's very popular with
the tourists and also the locals gets a
lot of traffic every day and this is one
of the reasons why that is actual tea
house if it looks a little bit familiar
it's actually because it's where
miyazaki world famous japanese artist
and director i got his inspiration for
the movie spirited away' so if you
remember the bath house in that movie
that's that building that bath house is
based off of this tea house here in jail
