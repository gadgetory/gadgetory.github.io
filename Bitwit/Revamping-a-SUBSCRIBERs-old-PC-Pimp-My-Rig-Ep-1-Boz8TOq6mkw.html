and Sennheiser brings you into the game
with an open back design featuring
angled drivers for pinpoint locational
accuracy be heard clearly through the
fold-down noise cancelling mic and enjoy
the long-lasting comfort of large plush
velvet ear pads now available in an all

as good as it sounds for more info click
the link in the description and catch
the drop before it's gone oh okay so do
you have no life cept higher grade the
other week I took my cousin's gaming PC
I basically upgraded it aesthetically
pimped it out so to speak and you guys
seemed to really enjoy that so this time
around I thought I'd do something a
little different by doing the same thing
to a fans PC this is Kent's system he's
a longtime viewer of the channel and he
has a really nice system actually it's
pretty solid performance wise which
makes it a great candidate for throwing
in some aesthetic upgrades which we're
going to do today should be a lot of fun
maybe even a performance upgrade or two
we shall see but let's quickly talk
about his PC where we're coming from we
have a core i5 6600 K which is a four
core CPU from Intel still and great
gaming chip on the z170 platform it's a
z170 M pro 4s from asrock it's actually
a micro ATX board which is somewhat
dwarfed inside of this ATX tower from
deep cool this is one of their more
budget level entry-level pieces there's
a hyper 212 from Coolermaster we got 16
gigs of DDR for memory belief from Team
Group not sure what speed though a GTX
970 from MSI it's actually pretty solid
still for gigabyte card for megabytes
along with three drives two of which are
mechanical one of which is an SSD from
which he is booting and then we have a
550 watt Hale 8 2 V 2 power supply from
NZXT 80 plus bronze certified modular
and all that jazz so altogether a pretty
decent system for you know him having
having built it just a couple of years
ago but it could definitely use a
cosmetic of bump it doesn't look all
that pretty nothing to gets deep cool
they make some great products but the
case is just really not doing it for me
this is the side panel it's old
acrylic get scratched up and stuff
basically what we're dealing with you
today is a PC that from a performance
standpoint is ready to rock but has a
long way to go in the aesthetic
department so we're gonna help it out
today I also want to give a huge shout
out and thanks to Coursera for
sponsoring a lot of the hardware and
upgraded parts that are gonna be going
into this system this build would not be
possible without them
now before we just start pulling parts
out and swapping parts in I want to
quickly go over my thought process
behind this upgrade as an upgrade as a
PC upgrade and I wanted to keep the core
platform unlike the part one of great
video of my Craigslist PC series that we
can ignore that but for this bill I'm
gonna do things right this time and keep
the core platform so we're keeping the
z170 chipset the motherboard and the CPU
as well 6600 pay still a very solid chip
for gaming however the motherboard heat
sinks are kind of concerning to me
they're a nasty gold color that's really
not gonna match with anything else by
the time this build is done so I want to
pop those off and just give them a nice
plastidip treatment just plain black
have them blend in with the rest of the
PCB this probably shouldn't affect temps
very much it's not a crazy overclocking
board just from looking at the DRM so I
really dealt thermals are a huge concern
here but the board will come out looking
a lot better at the end of the day now
despite all the praise that I've given
the hyper 212 over the years for being a
great price to performance option it's
really not the prettiest cooler on the
market so we're gonna be swapping that
up with something a little bit more
classy also the memory and power supply
here are pretty much good to go in my
opinion I would not mind reusing them
but because we have Corsair as a primary
sponsor they've actually decided to hook
end up with a brand new kit of memory
and a power supply some will be swapping
those out as well obviously if we were
on a more conventional budget then I'd
probably find a way to make the existing
PSU and memory work I'm not gonna touch
the storage solution at all that's all
Kent at this point the case however I
think needs to go it's looking a little
dated and for the amount of nice-looking
Hardware that we're gonna be putting
inside of this case I think the outside
also needs to reflect that sexiness so
once again we're going to look to
Corsair for that upgrade and finally the
graphics card gtx 970 very solid card
even here in 2018 however i think
because Kent is such a cool guy in such
a great fan even after all these years I
think we're gonna upgrade his GP just
because we can tossing some cable
extensions an LED strip perhaps and I
think we can call it a day so that's
what we're up against today folks
I think the first rule of order here is
to gut the system completely and get
access to those motherboard heatsink so
we can begin spray-painting them and
then we'll just go from there so why
don't we do that all right our
motherboards complete the heat sinks
dried up pretty well they're finally
black and matching everything else on
the board so we have a color neutral
motherboard to start with we can begin
adding more parts to the mix starting
with this first wave of Corsair hardware
like a vengence RGB Pro 16 gigabyte kit
this is DVR for 3200 speed 10 RGB LEDs
per module creates a very nice series of
LED effects we also have the H 100 I Pro
RGB 240 millimeter liquid AO I think the
ML series fans are the real star of the
show here they're just absolutely
fantastic performers and maybe it's a
bit overkill for the amount of
overclocking that Kent might do on his
6600 K but at the very least it will
look really nice and it'll probably keep
the system in check in terms of
acoustics with those very quiet and L
series fans so that's what we're gonna
start with now let's just go ahead and
prep the board and then we'll move on to
installing it in Kent's brand new case
moving right along here our motherboards
all prepped and it's looking good
already
it's about to look a whole lot better
though inside of its brand-new chassis
this is the Corsair crystal series 2 ATX
micro ATX case which means it's gonna
match and sort of fit this motherboard a
lot more proportionately than the
previous chassis that it was in this
case is great for liquid cooling and air
cooling alike it's got plenty of
tempered glass that you can see sort of
the beauty side of things but also a
second chamber for power supply storage
and cabling so you can hide all of that
nasty business
but Oh plastic wrap hello hold on hold
on oh excuse me while I don't get
distracted at all you know my job's hard
sometimes but this makes it all worth it
where was I oh yes building a computer
let's do that
all right getting down to the wire here
all we have left to do is install our
drives we have plenty of storage space
inside of this case we also have our
power supply which is sponsored yet
again by Corsair this is their RM 650 X
beautiful units absolutely fantastic
reliability 80 plus gold certified fully
modular very quiet fan and so forth
we're also going to be dropping in some
sleeved extensions once again from up
here this is the same brand that I used
for my cousin's PC however these are a
very different type of sleeping instead
of the sort of plastic I don't know if
it's paracord the sort of plastic
inflexible sleeping that we saw
previously this is more of like a fabric
type of material which is also very nice
just make sure that you know which one
you're getting I initially thought that
these were black and white cables but
now I'm kind of glad that they turned
out to be more silvery because there's
gonna be more silver in this build than
I originally anticipated after I add in
the upgraded GPU which is the EVGA GTX
1084 the win with its silvery accents it
should be a very nice bump over the gtx
970 and this is my own car that i'm
donating here to the bill not sponsored
just thought you guys should know what
an awesome person I am so without
further ado let's go ahead and wrap this
build up and then we'll cut to some sexy
b-roll and call it a day
whoa we're gonna build yeah what a
difference changing almost every single
component in a computer makes it's okay
we're still using the same motherboard
and CPU it's technically kind of the
same computer but totally not at any
rate it looks a lot nicer than than it
used to in my opinion looks or
subjective Kent might hate it and at
that point it's his problem and no
longer mine but for the meantime I think
he's gonna enjoy it there's a lot of air
moving through the case more importantly
with these high-profile Corsair fans
it's very RGB lit in there with the
cable mod wide beam LED strip and then
the RAM and the waterblock
it's all configurable to a point to
Kent's liking the h100 i RGB Pro
actually didn't get to get plugged into
the motherboard because that mobo only
has one USB 2.0 header which is
currently occupied by the lighting node
Pro that comes included with this
chassis so if Kent wanted to actually
fiddle with the RGB lighting on this
waterblock he'd probably have to get
like a USB 2.0 hub to make that happen
but everything else is pretty much good
to go it's one thing I overlooked when
when starting this this revamp was
there's only one USB 2.0 header on that
motherboard I'll check next time our GTX
1080 is sagging a little bit I kind of
expected that because I know the card
very well I know that it's prone to
sagging but it doesn't look like it'd be
too difficult to prop it up especially
since it's so close to the floor of the
chassis but yeah again this is this is
the build this is Kent's new system
hopefully he likes it you guys let me
know what you think in the comments
