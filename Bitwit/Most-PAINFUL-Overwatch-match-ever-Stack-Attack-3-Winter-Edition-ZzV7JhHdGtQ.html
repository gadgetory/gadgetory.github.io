come over here check out this Tower of
Power
damn and the perfect pair to match oh
yeah go ahead and touch him if you like
I can barely fit my hand around the room
that's a pull-out guy said he looked me
straight in my eyes as he was feeling
him up said he'd never seen anything
like it I can't believe what I'm hearing
right now you guys are disgusting oh
you're just talking about the case fans
oh sorry
continue the new h 500 p from
Coolermaster sports a pair of 200
millimeter RGB fans generous radiator
support and phenomenal cable management
packed in a unique industrial exterior
click the link of the description to
learn more what's going on guys welcome
back to the channel it is time for yet
another this is the 1v1 gaming showdown
with a tabletop twist today wifey sauce
and i will be going head-to-head in a
round of overwatch yes specifically we
will be playing our own custom version
of amazed
snowball offensive as suggested by
disturbed medic on twitter so thank you
very much disturb my story she ate it
the way this is gonna work is that
before the round starts wifey sauce and
i'm will each be dealt four random
attack cards which will then be able to
play on each other during the match in
order to gain a competitive edge the tax
would either be challenge based or a
time based and will have this cute
little blue cube to keep us on track now
the only way that a player can have
multiple attacks in effect at the same
time is by stacking two attack cards
simultaneously and that'll deal some
devastating damage or a really
devastating combo attack to their
opponent and each player can only stack
their cards once and some attacks cannot
be stacked and it will be indicated on
which cards
that's true the first player to reach 15
kills or whoever has the most kills at
the end of the 15-minute match will be
today's champion and the loser will have
to endure a ice bath of shame and defeat
so stay tuned for that I'm obviously not
very good at video games everyone knows
that especially from the previous death
she's worse than me and that says a lot
so um I will have a handicap which means
that Kyle can only use Mays secondary
attack oh and he has to play within
inverted access impacts a lot actually
and hopefully that will give me enough
handicap who actually have a chance of
winning
maybe the cards be with me on that note
let's go ahead and deal these guys out
and let me go ahead and shuffle these
really quickly
all right so Rock Paper Scissors to see
who draws first let's go all right I get
to go first
drumroll aah all right I got the old
wreath around basically we're gonna have
to hang the Christmas wreath over or
monitor your vision will be severely
impacted yep fun
I got a snowball fight
so basically Kyle be pelted with little
foam balls like a nerf gun that Christie
in turn will be firing at me from afar
Chris might actually be on like my team
it'll be an intern turret yeah all right
let's go for this guy
Christmas tree hotline the way this is
gonna work is that Heather will have to
actually call up a Christmas tree store
or a Christmas tree lot and keep them on
the phone for three minutes while gaming
can't wait to see that play time for me
because I already have a hard time
playing I'm not gonna be able to focus
on anything
I know Secret Santa so basically Kyle
has to unwrap a gift that will be all
taped up and kind of difficult to open
and then use whatever is inside
the gift alright fair enough okay
bundle up that one would have been in
bed for you right so bundle up basically
Heather would have to dress up a
multiple layers we have like two heavy
jackets mittens and beanie so for three
minutes
hopefully you you overheat and start
sweating on camera blank ah midnight
snack
Kyle will have to finish an entire glass
of milk and eat all the cookies before
he can start playing with both hands
again so basically one hand has to
always be holding either a cookie or the
glass of milk and he cannot use that
hand to use neither peripherals okay
yeah all right sounds good no problem
frostbite so Heather will at some point
during this match have to submerge her
feet into an ice bath which means I'm
getting a cinnamon challenge that's
actually one of the attacks for today
okay because somehow that is a great
idea everyone knows in the cinnamon
challenge is horrible then they'll find
out alright so those are our cards go
ahead and take yours and get your bottom
to your side and let's get this show on
the road
I also have to make sure that my up to
make sure that I can hear I have to make
sure I'm inverted inverted there it is
pics or it didn't happen I'm feeling
pretty confident based on my track
record don't really have much to worry
about it's happening it's happening I'm
not very confident and my hands already
clammy there we go
oh god I have not played inverted since
like Goldeneye on the n64 oh wait crap I
can only use my my secondary attack
right which is like horrible when
combined with inverted because it's you
actually have to have good accuracy to
use this I'm like her primary oh don't
you owe me I told you to never put up
your walls with me honey
hey I've gotten the first kill every
time you play what nothing oh I can hear
you being a little cold over there I can
hear you shivering or maybe that's me
actually you're pretty quiet over there
honey cuz I'm scared nothing to be
scared of
alright 2-0 bill wreaths around oh shoot
oh god the wreath is similar to screen
glaucoma and episode 1 so that bad oh oh
my god I Ellie up once out on you oh yes
oh my god this is horrible
Christopher attack Oh No
Chris go easy on me man oh wait hold on
I gotta know
before head school it's all good yeah
I'm getting shot at in the videotape and
in real life there's too much happening
right now
respawn I'm putting this over mic get
out I hear you Kris I never knew you had
such amazing aim you're fired
that was super effective oh my gosh I
cannot see I really wish I could use my
alt right now yeah I know
oh come on oh my god seriously
seriously Oh over there hurry
died yes yes I'm so cool I'm so cool oh
my god well I think we finally found a
way to balance the teams it's freezing
in here I feel conflicted about this
card because on one hand she handles
heat very well but those mittens well
you've been freezing me up I thought I'd
return the favor by helping you get a
little warmer the hell are you yeah
don't forget that okay okay fine totally
fine oh really
the heat isn't that bad but these means
I have like zero finger abilities I
can't
Oh oh my go what the hell
what is this what am I even looking at
right now oh no I can feel myself dying
nope nope nope nope nope alright that's
how you want to play it
oh my god this is oh my god it's so
freaking I'm guessing there's no dpi
button on this mouse the switches suck
the size sucks the sensor sucks
everything sucks oh my god oh wait timer
three thank God it's not forever god
it's hot in here
oh my eyes are burning actually that
eyes are burning good cool you down with
my gun no oh come on just one HP yeah oh
my god
how you holding up over there honey oh
come on seriously I think I lost yeah
I'm dying right now I'm so sweaty
oh those mittens are doing the Oh
across the map come on no oh Jesus I
forget that you have other attacks since
I'm only using my one oh come on
yes all right less than five minutes
remaining four minutes and 34 seconds
reeking kidding me like Pierce is insane
good luck with this one Kyle joke oh
shit okay
how you doing their files cannot speak
right now oh is it really that bad I
think you're being dramatic
well maybe it is bad Oh God a bird why
is it burn no no no oh my god
alright screw you Christmas tree oh my
frostbite stack attack so I'm stacking
these two cards together because I think
gaming on the phone is gonna be hard
enough but combine that with freezing
cold ice water we've got a recipe for
disaster
oh yeah Oh
oh it was horrible heck are you
hi I had a few questions this is my
first time buying like a Christmas tree
what good is what more trees you guys
have okay and what is like the big
difference between those trees can you
even describe to the hell painful this
is like it's so bad
I I can't even keep my feet submerged in
the water that's that's that's how bad
it is like I need a timeout okay and um
and are those ones the ones that are
less popular are those ones that are a
little bit more like open like they
don't have as much like foilage and
stuff like that okay um and I'm trying
not to laugh because this phone call is
just hilarious but at the same time I
kind of feel bad for her because I could
just tell she's miserable

cheese do you guys have so like what

cookies to save my ass finally I get to
chow down on these cookies I've been
eyeing them all day
