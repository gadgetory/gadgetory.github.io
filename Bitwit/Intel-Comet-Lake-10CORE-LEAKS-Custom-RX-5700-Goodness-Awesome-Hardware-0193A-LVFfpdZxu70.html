those pre-pre adult language all the
kids Kyle I know I'm sorry
don't don't ever I'm not a role model
usually Oh me thousands of children
tuned in right as the show starts and
every time we do we say hey guys every
once in a while we use adult language
all the parents diligently after their
kids away so they can't hear and now all
of those kids ears have been tainted by
your foul mouth we should we should also
have another warning at the beginning of
the show that says occasionally we all
use foul language before if we remember
to give you a warning so you should have
watched the last show - gotten the
warning about this show and then that
would all make sense so we get repeat
viewers what those gives going on
welcome everyone to awesome hardware
it's kool-aid it's also awesome hardware
episode 193 side a so that's that's my
half today and about half an hour so
we're gonna switch over to Paul's half
which today is gonna be sort of a pulse
app is gonna be more or less like a Q&amp;amp;A
slash after-party gaming does have some
some headliners so stick around for that
arguably more important than your news
that's that that's why it's arguable
that's just your opinion you're right no
it's it's it's supplementary news it's
like the news that you didn't realize
you wanted to hear about but you
actually do once you hear it yeah that's
what I was going for today I'm cool that
also games it's gonna be great so in
case today we are we're talking about
you know follow up follow up news about
rise in 3000 as well as Nabi although
all the new stuff from AMD there's a lot
of follow up news on that and we're also
gonna be talking about comet Lake ten
millimeter or 10 nanometer will even is
this or no no it's still 40 nanometer
plus was plus cookies these are cookies
the cookie that was in my mouth and in
Paul's hand and the thumbnail these are
the same cookies well they're from the
same batch ones from the thumbnail are
eating yes they're very good Paul makes
the perfect cookie chocolate chip it's
just the chewy they're soft they're you
know the make the right amount of
sweetness right amount a number of
chocolate chips it's very scientific
Paul's baking
oh yeah but you should try one of Paul's
cookies do you think it's hardware is
hot you have it has cookies
no wonder you love my cookies wonder
your wife married you alright so today
we are also selling things on our store
so if you would like to check out my
store it's big Wake Tech where I've got
shirts and pint glasses and hoodies and
stuff I thought it was appropriate to
wear my bio splasher shirt today because
we might be talking about some BIOS news
news with the rising three thousand
great kyon seems very at the fitting we
also have stuff on Paul's store Paul's
hardware net matter he has the same high
quality merchandise lovely designs and
apparel good things that you can check
out oh well we'll yell Johnson that you
at the end of the show if you happen to
buy something from either of our stores
yep we also like to have a few drinks on
the show as you might have already seen
and we occasionally use our language as
I demonstrated earlier that was an
accent I don't usually start every show
every street with a deaf pop but it does
happen so if you have the little ones
around sensitive ears you weren't Cheers
oh that's good belching beaver peanut
butter milk step this is gonna go really
good with what the cookies you made oh
yeah I can't wait to try that combo
perfect pair
alright let's just dive in here our
first article is from WCC F Tech it was
good they've always got the fun big
headlines not quick beauty at all this
is about Intel's 10th gen comment Lake
CPUs 10th there's been a whole lineup
the whole lineup has been has been
leaked
as far as specs the names prices all
that stuff really and I really hate the
naming scheme if this is true please
hello the ten nine hundred the how are
you gonna say f the core I nine ten nine
hundred calf that's horrible quarry nine
ten thousand nine hundred like it just
looks it looks bad it sounds bad we
could have a whole half a show just just
on the terrible naming scheme there's
too many zeros and they're not evenly
distributed yeah there's too many
numbers
yeah it's starting to look like an old
Lee and Lee case yeah you know just no
no good marketing there but let's let's
talk about the actual meat of this
article here we've got 13 different SKUs
that just had their specs leaked
that's the whole friggin family 13 of
these 14 nanometer now plus plus plus
CPUs because Intel is still working on
their 10 nanometer chips that should be
available later this year from what
we've been told but we'll see if wait
these are what yeah this is 10th gen gen
comment Lake which would have been so
nice 14 then which would have been great
to have like their 10th gen be the 10
nanometer like I felt like after after
how much effort AMD put into like having
sentiment 7 nanometre launched on July 7
thing Kevin said he got real match he
match they got super matchy-matchy and
Intel's just like you know flips the
table we don't give an F where we're
gonna be 10th gen but still 14 animator
I'll be it with three pluses after it
which is just starting to get a little
silly but we have let's talk about the
chips here we've got flagship core i9
parts that are rocking 10 cores and 20
threats okay it was pretty expected that
they would raise the core count wasn't
very sure wasn't very certain to how
much if they would be matching AMD's now
flagship 12 core and in a couple months
or in a month or two
there's 16 core doesn't look like
Intel's gonna be very close to that at
all
but 10 cores 20 threads is still
somewhat of a leg up over 8 cores and 16
threads which is their existing 9900 k
spec these are gonna start these core i9
parts are gonna start at four hundred
and nine dollars all the way up to $4.99
which is kind of surprising because
right now the 9900 K is it was well over
500 dollars when it first launched now
we're getting to more cores and four
more threads on these core and nine
parts but they're gonna be around this
around the same price
for one of their eight core 16 thread
parts it's almost as if they're lowering
their prices to stay competitive with
the competition which is a good thing I
guess we should be happy about this
they're also gonna have two core i7s to
you oh the other thing to point out here
is that they're gonna have multiple core
i9 parts not just a single flagship on
their mainstream side I'm so instead of
just that one we've got at least two
there's gonna be two core i7 skews
rocking eight cores and 16 threads which
is what
Intel's currently highest flagship
mainstream chip is rockin but these are
gonna be priced anywhere between
three hundred and thirty nine and three
hundred and eighty nine dollars which is
also pretty competitively priced
compared to what Intel has launched
their eight core 16 thread CPUs for in
the past and even currently we also have
Core i5 chips with a six core 12 thread
setup and these are gonna start at one
hundred and seventy nine dollars going
up to two hundred and sixty nine these
prices are similar to the existing core
i5s that we that we have now like the
you know like the 9600 K for example but
these are gonna support hyper threading
again this is a really it seems like
they're really trying to compete with
AMD here with with AMD having all their
CPUs regardless of tear supporting
simultaneous multi-threading for the
most part whereas Intel is traditionally
not really had that feature available
unless it was on their more premium
high-end products so now we're starting
to see that that sort of feature set
trickle down to their lower end CPUs on
the Intel side core i3 SKUs are gonna be
starting at $129 going up to 179 these
are gonna be parted out with a fork or
eight thread configuration so even their
core i3 s it seems like all their core a
threes will be hyper threaded huh and
bear in mind that a four core eight
thread part from Intel retailed for over
three hundred dollars just a few
generations ago Wow and now we're gonna
see him on core i3 s4 as well as 129
bucks it's almost like they could have
put hyper threading on all their CPUs at
any time the whole and and yeah all they
needed was some competition all they did
was it so we have some more details
specifically about the flagship parts in
each of these categories so for the core
I 9 as we sort of thick heard about or
just complained about in the title
they're the quarry nine ten nine hundred
KF I still don't know if I should say
ten nine hundred or ten thousand nine
hundred or the 109 hundred it just that
alone is a problem it's still you don't
even know how to say it but it's gonna
be the rumored flagship it's the rumored
flagship currently going up against the
Rison 930 900 X which has 12 cores and
24 threads is it was there any I sorry
if I missed it but was there
explanation in this article as to where
this information came from or like like
how oh yeah computer base computer base
got it from a Chinese base tech forum
okay that was the original source which
though the Chinese forms are usually
pretty accurate with the leaks not
always still grain of salt but a lot of
the ones that I've been hearing recently
I'm like oh I guess that turned out to
be true that doesn't mean that they're
all true of course grain of salt all
around but or you could look at it like
Oh big like what a surprise
immediately after and these stuff
launches like an intentional leak this
information just happens to slip out
right right yeah maybe maybe like this
the China team of Intel just like
doesn't care they don't care like
they're the like they're like the myth
the mischievous the mischievous branch
of Intel or they're like they're in
charge of like sabotaging their own
launches to you know build to generate
hype it'll build the Hydra hype train I
know we're not doing
sorry fed on this but I'm gonna go with
fake this is yeah I just not announce
the treat not a lick of truth here such
horrible names like some of the yeah I
hope some of the skews look out look
okay I mean if they really are launching
a full lineup of on 14 nanometer still
this year prior to like alright is 10
nanometer coming out like how how other
these launches gonna have to be knowing
knowing that AMD is already there was
seven nanometer which is very
competitive and knowing that Intel has
been working on 10 nanometer for so long
like how how can they possibly even drum
up very much enthusiasm or public
interest in ring and launch like this
maybe they're just going for it because
they've invested enough time into its
development that they've gotta launch
something right but I'm just really
these names are horrible usually they
they're intelligent enough to I mean
well they'll be right there there is a
historic like like for for numbers you
can't go past for numbers you can't like
Golden Rule yeah fun with members or
whatever you can get up to four numbers
but you gotta five numbers there's just
too many you
it usually always resets back to three
or something like right AMD and NVIDIA
go back and forth but between like the
one of them's on the 600 series 700
series whatever right and 500 hey okay
no yeah yeah you're totally right about
that Paul I do hope that some of the
information in this article is false all
of it but we'll just have to wait and
see this is all we have for now you know
it's definitely it definitely raises an
eyebrow that you know it's possible to
that you know even though it seems a
little bit suspicious that this would
surface right after the the big AMD
launches that maybe it's also a good
reason for people to just create fake
news you know because they know they'll
be a lot of hype on both sides a lot of
interest on both sides of the
competition but moving on here we have
based on boos clocks of that core i9
part I'm not even gonna address it by
name I'm just too frustrated three point
four and five point two gigahertz so
that's a 200 megahertz boost over a
higher of a boost single core boost than
the existing 99 hundred K so potentially
you might be able to overclock to five
point two gigahertz on all cores it
doesn't necessarily mean that and I say
that because a lot of people have been
speculating this is sort of a digression
here but that you'd be able to overclock
the 3900 x2 4.6 gigahertz on all cores
simply because it has a single core
boost to four point six figures I saw
this on being addressed with like
hardware inboxed and Steve and gamers
Nexus for chiming in on Twitter just
trying to like clear up any confusion
because people just had this idea in
their minds that oh a single core boost
means that generally means that you can
do an all core Manuel overclocked to
that same speed case it's been true with
some chips in the past yes some some
some cases it's a it's a pattern but
it's not it's not consistent
certainly not with any of them these
recent nothing on rising yeah right
behave that way so there's there's that
it's gonna have a 105 watt TDP but
remember that Intel's tvp's are
typically only referring to their base
clock power consumption and
necessarily any other boosts so take
that with a grain of salt it's gonna
have 20 megabytes of cash we're gonna
have a core i7 flagship the 10 700 K
which is an 8 core 16 thread part
equally terrible naming competes against
the resin 730 800 X which is also an 8
core 16 thread part it's gonna have a
3.6 gigahertz base and 5.1 gigahertz
boost sixteen megabytes of cash at three
hundred and eighty nine dollar price
this is not a ksq so it does have this
is 339 okay about ten 700 K oh okay
sorry is it three three 339 that or the
article says something different than
the church weird because it also says
that the flagship parts are the i7 skis
will go up to 389 and then it calls this
10 700 K the flagship core i7 but the
charts wrong with the articles wrong 389
that would be a lot closer to the eye 9
10 800 F which I'm very excited about
personally wait does the non k ones mean
they're not gonna be overclockable again
they're stupid the non K ones yeah I
think so yeah right so you could
probably get a cheaper motherboard with
it or something it's totally different
system and then we've got Core i5 10 600
K which is the flagship Core i5 6 core
12 threads which is gonna compete with
the horizon 5:30 600 X and that's gonna
have a 3.7 and 4.9 gigahertz base in
news cloth respectively with 12
megabytes of cash there's also a core i5
10 406 scored 12 thread for $179 which
is gonna be cheaper than the risin 530
600 that's kind of interesting and then
the core i3 1030 104 core 8 thread part
boosting up to 4 point 4 gigahertz with
also a price of 179 which is the same
price as the core i5 that I just
mentioned so that it'll be interesting
to see how that plays out there's some
really odd looking specs on this chart
that
verify at a later time if it's all much

there's also rumored to be a new LGA
11:59 platform required for 10th gen so
sorry to all of you LGA 1151 motherboard
owners Intel does not think that you
should have a scalable platform and that
you can make an investment in a
motherboard and still continue to use
that board over multiple generations of
CPU releases no you must upgrade both by
the CPU and and the motherboard which is
gonna be a pain in the ass if you
already have a system built and you want
to swap out your board it's literally
connected to everything in your system
but that says the Intel wet or at least
it has been for quite some time now it
doesn't seem to be changing much new
chipset it's probably gonna mean the new
chipset as well z4 90 it's not an
official name or anything again this is
all rumor or speculation great assault
but at least z4 90 would be less
terrified or terrible than core ID 9 10
10 900 KF yes apparently this this
platform is gonna be adding native
support to to the board to the platform
for ddr4 3200 speed memory versus the
existing 2666 speeds that it's currently
natively supporting so that's fun chat
no why don't I see chat kind of saying
it's fake
here is length they are giving us there
quite a few people in chat saying it's
fake
ok so what is this is this the this is
the truth this is the fake chart I don't
know I don't I don't usually just click
on random links in chat no no no this is
from this is from sell o sell put that
yeah alright well then he if so put it
there than it's obvious he'll say if he
doesn't have irises ok well if it's fake
its fake probably definitely not the
first time we've talked about fake news
on this on the show but from what from
everything I'm reading so far I'm
actually kind of relieved and I
that it's faked and I and I hope it is
and I hope that we get 10 nanometer CPUs
from Intel as the next launch I think
we're all pretty sick of 14 enemy here
at this point that's been years but
let's move on then to hopefully some
more real news though enemies confirmed
that custom rx 5700 series GPUs are
coming next month whoo
yeah it's from hardware this was through
an official AMD tweet which is not
listed on this article but I'm sure it's
real I don't need to verify that of
course mid-august is apparently when the
first question is what the answer
according to AMD with a link that you
would expect to be the link to AMD make
yeah that's but no search of hot
hardware with your AMD tag right cuz
that hardware god forbid you link off of
your website
people just get so worried about that
okay okay
all right so mid-august that's uh just
about a month away now month month in a
week so that's exciting because from
what we've been hearing from like guys
like gamers Nexus and other reviewers
who hear reddit all right there's a via
link at the bottom okay
the stock coolers on these Nabi cards
Navi cards is not they're not the best
they're loud they're hot
and of course aims really good all right
Herc woman posted it unread it o is on
reddit yeah okay yeah we gotta know why
I don't know wizened this is why people
watch our shows because it's the live
investigative journalism that we do
yeah just bringing you the information
as we read it so this is kind of
exciting like I said that the stock
colors are pretty pretty garbage no one
no one should buy them and also you're
gonna get not only better cooling and
better noise profiles with these custom
cards but potentially better power
delivery as well it could actually
perform better and give you a couple
extra frames there for your dollar and
usually for a couple extra dollars yeah
I was gonna say yeah though they might
be a little bit more expensive but I
think it'd be worth it for sure unless
you buy one of the reference designs and
slap your own kind of cooler on there
whether it be like one of those NZXT
add-ons or something similar I've been
seeing a lot of people throwing on like
like r9 290 and r9 390x coolers on on
these 5,700 cards I really and actually
it bolts up pretty pretty nicely hmm
turns out similar similar board design
yeah so you can try that too
what if you don't want to mess around
with that business custom cards are on
the way they should be here soon
speaking of there is uh there's been
some leaks from from MSI I don't know if
it's from in a side of this the slides
are from the other side there's some new
MSI slides that reveal product stack for
custom rx 5700 of series cards two on
the XT side we've got the gaming X the
Evoque OC the mech o sea and the air
boost from the nan XT 5700 cards we've
got the gaming X Necco sea and air
Buddhists so there's a bit of a there's
another slide here that talks about the
the mech or at least there's a quote
from it from MSI that was probably from
the slide that says if the mech the mech
series is pretty much just focusing on
the essentials so it's gonna be more
value oriented they're obviously not
focusing on how to spell focus yeah
focuses focuses focuses okay sorry yeah
please continue cap yeah so it's gonna
be more of like you know just the basics
it's the GPU for the basin that has the
basics it's probably gonna perform just
fine probably better than reference
however its it's not gonna have a bunch
of bells and whistles on it it's gonna
come in at a lower price then a lot of
the other custom cards perhaps if I'm
down yeah it should run cooler with its
dual fan design it should be a lot
quieter as well than a one of the blower
fan fans blower designs from AMD don't
have much information other than that
but well yeah this is I think this is
the first custom
bored we've seen for 5700 series have
you seen any others no see the lot of
super but oh yeah he's a super just like
all of the special designs of the 20
that the RTX 2017 2060 that they already
have they're just gonna swap over to the
supers yeah yeah yeah
fewer brand new designs for that series
alright so one one last story here about
the Ark 5700 series cards is an article
from overclocked 3d confirming that
these these GPUs will lack crossfire
support now and the question right after
that is does anyone care so I guess this
is just sort of a reminder that
multi-gpu configurations and just that
whole thing is kind of in the toilet
multi-gpu configs have been in the
toilet for quite some time now for a
number of multitude of reasons
performance hasn't been consistent and
it's very unreliable there there isn't a
whole lot of support that developers are
dumping into multi-gpu setups for their
games such configurations can have much
higher noise and thermal thermal results
which is not good a single GPU is almost
always faster all right I'm sorry almost
always a better option than to smaller
GPUs this is something that we've been
saying for years and you can tell we've
just been seeing a huge decline in multi
GPU support I think it was with the GTX
10 series that the Pascal that they
stopped doing SLI on what was it like
any car any of the the more entry-level
or mid-range cards the key was only
reserved for the GTX 1070 and 1080 think
that's also when they cut support for 3
&amp;amp; 4 way and they said yeah right just
gonna focus on two-way yep exactly and
now it's like then even two ways I feel
like the only benefit to 2a or for any
multi-gpu config now is is that it looks
cool like it looks more peacefully when
you've got two GPUs and you're in your
your system especially if you're
water-cooling them you know it's it's
like an O and AH it's kind of like a
shock effect
shocking awful thing since here came to
show P explicit and we'll play GPU mode
for Vulcan under the x12 yeah there are
some rare instances where the game
developer will allow it just simply
through more of a feature those api's
yeah right of the api's but it's pretty
rare it's pretty rare that you actually
see that and I don't feel like the
performance there is also it has been
very inconsistent so that's all to say
that crossfire sucks no one cares that
it won't be here for for this generation
oh jeez
let's move on to the last story for that
I have today this is about gue Bauer he
posted the video you should all
subscribe to do Bauer's YouTube channel
he does a lot of good stuff there and he
did a bunch of tests on X 570 the
chipset specifically to find out why
does it consume so much power why is the
TDP of this brand new chipset more than
double what its predecessor X 470 was
well when he was walking around copy
text the show floor of copy Tex this
year he was told by a number of vendors
as as was I that the reason for the
extreme power consumption on X 570 was
due to PCIe Gen 4 and that it just
required more juice to power those those
higher end devices with more bandwidth
but in his testing he found that that
wasn't really the case he stressed
multiple PCIe gen 4 devices
simultaneously so if you look at the
blue the blue the blue graphs there
that's x4 70
you've got idle with no devices
connected and then with one nvme drive
connected and then one nvme drive under
load and so yeah it consumes a bit more
power under load of course but then when
you look at the yellow graphs the yellow
bars and he did the same test you can
obviously that when it's idling x5 70
consumes a lot more power at idle than
x4 70 it's just it just starts at a
higher base but from there from that
point it doesn't really consume that
much more power when you have a PCI
agent for device being stressed at full
load so he couldn't really determine it
looks like the PC a Gen 4 SSD that he
was stressing here
didn't really consume all that much more
power than the PCI gen3 device did on X
470 so he's kind of baffled here and
doesn't really have a reason or he can't
pinpoint why the chips that requires so
much extra power and this kind of makes
it a bit baffling as to why almost every
single X 570 motherboard has an active
cooling solution on it with with a
little little tiny fan and you know that
you know usually has a couple heat pipes
that go to the rest of the vrm and he's
a big focus on active cooling on these
boards but in der Bauer's experience
he actually had multiple devices being
stressed simultaneously and he even
swapped out the the active fan active
cooling solution for a little tiny
passive heatsink and after all of his
testing his temps his temperatures
peaked at just 74 degrees Celsius so it
didn't seem like he was overheating the
chipset even despite there being little
to no air flow and and and passive
cooling it's kinda interesting that I'm
kind of triggered that he doesn't have
his MDOT to drive oh well no wonder it
wasn't consuming much power he didn't
install it right yeah he's a pro
overclocker but he doesn't auto can
affect address doesn't mean he knows how
to build a PC that's a verge probably
there's a virgin joke in there somewhere
I have two thoughts about this one well
as I thought I to have two thoughts two
thoughts one is it aim the aim he told
us that the the tags they using for the
chipsets are the same ones that's the IO
die and the Verizon 3000 chips
themselves you've got either one or two
little chip --let's with the CPU cores
on them then you have an i/o a die
that's either 12 or 14 nanometer
manufacturing process built they were
never a hundred percent clear about that
so I like I don't know how far like how
the development process goes at what
point they decided they were going to
use the same chip for both like hey
we've but it could be they designed it
to go on to be the i/o die for the CPU
which is gonna have a heat spreader over
it over it with a cooler in which point
like having oh well a slightly higher
TDP for a chipset not a big slightly
higher TDP for a chip like that not a
big deal
because it's gonna have plenty of
cooling on it and then at some point
like oh we could save XYZ development
time or whatever by reusing that for the
chipset on the motherboard as well
mm-hmm but we have to deal with the high
o so maybe maybe that has something to
do with it so like they thought it was
gonna consume more power than it really
did just because they reported no just
that it was originally designed to be to
be with a couple chip 'lets on a
substrate on a on a CPU uh-huh
that's gonna have cooling on it that was
the original intent for the design for
that for that chip right and then they
at some point realized oh we could use
that for the chipset as well yeah went
forward with that but the the fault you
know the downside to it was it had to
have active cooling right and then
potential answer to why it needs active
cooling even though tabara has tested it
was passive cooling and it didn't get
that hot and this is just me remembering
back to remember the p67
chipset recall that Intel originally had
back in when Sandy Bridge first launch
launched and it was because of the state
of the SATA controller that was part of
the chipset peripheral controller hub
and that they discovered would basically
wear out over time is because of the
traces and I think it I think it was a
heat issue there as well so I guess what
I'm saying is maybe those maybe those
two are somehow related I'm not I'm not
speaking very well maybe those two are
so no more than two not spall know
they're two thoughts it's two just two
made up of many other thoughts but the
fact that there has to be active cooling
on it is probably for like edge case
scenarios most of the time it's not
gonna get hot enough to require cooling
but if it ever does if it ever has the
potential to then they have to build all
the boards with the capability of
handling that situation yeah which makes
sense if if a m4 is the scalable
platform that people could be using for
generations right eventually you might
be slotting in a really high-end PCIe
gen for supported GPU and maybe somehow
they've done some kind of testing to
emulate that and realize oh with an
actual graphics card that's PTA Gen 4
that can you know utilize
this bandwidth it does get really hot
and they have to prepare for that
worst-case scenario look at my screen or
something no I was reading chat sorry oh
yeah a lot of porn bots thanks honey
thanks Alfred yeah kicking those porn
BOTS to the curb porn BOTS
 you porn BOTS making my life more
difficult
yeah but whatever the case I'm sure
there's gonna be a bunch of other
testing on on this on this topic and
it'll be interesting to see what comes
if 15 years ago like like a witch had
come and told you like in 15 years
you'll be like surrounded by porn BOTS
what would you have thought wow that
sounds great I've seen Austin Powers I
know never what all right on that note
let's Alice let's shuffle over to Pitt
my piece yeah because I owe you guys we
didn't get around to doing it two weeks
ago and we initially plan because my
stream system at the time was blue
screening unexpectedly oh yeah which has
been resolved by now but I felt really
bad that I didn't get around to it so
this time we're gonna do some
submissions thank you guys for
submitting all your your rigs they're
all terrible which is uh which is why
they're here now so the first one is
Bryson Bryson II risin 526 hundred with
an RX 580 640 gig SSD 16 gigs of RAM I
don't know what PSU and the best case
ever made Oh
Merry Christmas is that a sin T sin T
it's a sin T what's the sin T it's there
I don't know if they're still around
it's got these old-school optical drive
holders I've seen these like these
little plastic things yeah and I hate
them yeah thank you really I could not
tell you what case this is but it is it
really sin T is it Oh
someone said sin T but there's a s en te
y yeah did you recognize it as I sin T
or to deserve askew Sanjay no they just
said the Cintiq aces I remember not
thinking much of and I had that black
and red thing
and I feel like they might have used
these type of optical drive one Chet did
say senti so maybe you're right about
that
yeah I don't I don't know if that's the
best case ever made I would I would
challenge that but at any rate it looks
like your cable management could use
some help if this really was the best
case ever paced thank you
you'd probably be able to route that
eight pin CPU cable behind the
motherboard tray yeah but it doesn't
even look like you have like a cutout at
the top left of your case for that sort
of thing so this seems spot a DIY PC
solar mr1 I totally believe I'm physics
at pirate so that's really the garden is
very garbage PC manufacturer case
manufacturer I remember having to do PC
DIY cases reviews and videos at Newegg
haha because you know they they they
paid for the video to be done and it'd
be like you're gonna like draw straws
horrendously made like just cheapest
possible construction like setups for
for mining rigs this cuz it's alright
first of my young craze right and it was
just like why why would anyone pay for
this it's it's it's a bad product right
from the get-go if you're garbage and
it's like anyone who's mining is
spending as little money as possible no
one wants to buy a specialized mining
crate mining case because they're using
milk crates to prop the graphics cards
in or whatever so anyway yeah pretty
tangent but at any rate you should
probably burn it give new cases we're in
the hole get a new case again eh okay
you have a 2600 do you have good specs
here yes core specs are great focus on
aesthetics then in that case get a newer
case get some nice power supply cables
whether it's a new power supply with
just flat black cables if you want to
save some money or you can buy some
extensions you get a case where you can
put mount your SSD yeah somewhere out on
the floor would be proud Andy that must
be your super affordable
dust particles alongside it I'm sure
your CPU tips are fine because 2600 is a
fairly
cool running chip but I don't know I
think sorry Chad I should have warned
you guys before I zoomed in on it like
this like why just look at the key oh
man look at that look at the 8-pin
looking at it up close even worse that's
really bad yeah and why rebuild and also
yeah I would I would make your CPU
cooler vertical not horizontal I just
have a thing with putting the the CPU
cooler the heat sink fan right now right
over your GP right now the cooler master
logo is is facing the right is I guess
you get over that yeah yeah that's less
of an issue to me I would agree vertical
is more common but there's plenty of
space here I don't think that's really
causing a major problem this is pushing
air up not down depends on how hot that
you get in your case and power supply
and rebuild the system do it do it now
good thanks Grayson Dakota Dakota Duke
or Dakota wise to put a wise rise in
1600 issues X 370 Prime Pro a dual RT x
2060 that's an Asus dual not two of them
six 16 gigs of teen dark memory two
terabyte Barracuda three and a half
drive and define are six case ok
interesting we have an RT X 2060 and a
1600 you might be able to get a little
more performance out of that card with
like a faster faster CPU but that's ok
it's still gonna be great performance
very clean system actually I feel like
cable management is pretty good like
you're like 90% there I feel like the
some of the cables like the you I think
is that USB 3 at the top that's going
into that large grommet looks a little
funky because it's just in front of
everything yeah and then there's also
some cables at the bottom just over the
power supply shroud that oh that's also
the USB 3 that could be just tidied up
maybe like tucked away a little bit
tighter that's not just hanging out
there everything else looks really good
obviously I think power supply
extensions would go a long way here even
though they are black do not quite this
classy
and that's pretty much it if you want to
get super picky you could rotate your
fractal fan so that's a little little
snowflake logo it's the same on both of
them
yep that's minor though and maybe
consider something for your dad for your
SSD and we'll SSD drive there it's it's
got some blue and some green standing
out oh yeah
doesn't jive with the rest of the
building yeah other than that yeah I
like Cal said the cable management is
good yeah it's good it's honestly
perfectly fine anywhere else but I'm
putting my PC where we critique things
like this
but it could be better so so rebuild
your whole damn computer burn it to the
ground throw it in the trash no don't do
that
thank you thank you - good we have
William William by 1600 the first saw
this name was William Williamson 16 xh6
te AO 16 gigs GT X 1080 windforce from
gigabyte asus rog strix be 350f
motherboard and we have some ll series
fans and we have some other stuff ok a
lot of ll series fans that did not come
cheap
that's probably well over a hundred
bucks worth of fans there they're all l
series fans Oh at least the three of
them are oh no three-hour wait ok he
just got one 3-pack then but that's
still like 100 bucks yes I have to
remind myself for that every time I'm
using them yeah because of course
they're just sent them to me oh I know
so
they are so nice and that's such a
mixture their days they're so nice much
the fans in Riptide cussed dude probably
like $300 no like 600 like blue like yes
that's more than some people's pcs
there's 8 you privilege there's
eight hundred and forty millimeter ones
oh my god at the you know on the top
Brad one two three four five six and
then two
you know at the back of my pistol you
120s and then there's however many eyes
front
yeah it's ridiculous okay um so an 18
fans in there man
yeah I like the TIE fighter down at the
bottom going to the TIE fighter we also
have an interesting cable for your
graphics card is that purple or is it
just the lighting on the camera what's
good yeah that's kind of interesting
weird in the in the dark picture it
looks black but that's a dark picture
yeah any right it should all be black
you know same same sort of deal here
relieved extensions your cable
management is actually pretty good I
don't really have too many complaints
here yeah I feel like there's a cable
that is running down from where your GPU
is that's I think it's a daisy chain
there because maybe it's maybe an eight
plus eight which yeah that's that's
because all the risks to kale management
is so clean that stands out as as the
the more than noticeable part yeah I
don't know maybe a tiny bit down here at
the bottom with the cables from your
fans could be cleaned up again that's
just cuz everything else is so clean
elsewhere
good job overall I would say um good
looking build nice RGB is a little I
mean it's just an aesthetic thing you
know like here you've got white in the
front and then the RGB inside right
maybe that's okay maybe that's fine I
don't know I I would personally I know
it's ridiculous because we just talked
about how expensive these fans are but I
would save up for another 3000 order and
match them all it would look really nice
it does give you a wide variety of
options for color Matt you know yeah I
I've been enjoying doing these seasonal
colors for arctic panther back here mhm
you know mm-hmm changes with the seasons
so what I did with the the scent of the
old offices I didn't purchase my own
okay thank you very much William
Williamson we have Jack Jack the
Richards r5 2600 with the cooler master
master liquid 240
gigabyte Morris x4 70 gaming 7 Wi-Fi the
GTX 1080 gaming g1 from gigabyte and it
looks like we have 32 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance RGB at 3000 with ally and Lee
1110 heck those are 16 gig sticks and
ease Paul's mind yes it is on my desk
thank you always important that does
that does ease my mind all right so you
got 32 gigs usually got 16 gig sticks
with the 2600 I know running at 3000
that's a nice can I set up there though
series fans as well very nice it looks
like you don't have any or that okay
that is your intake and then you've got
the exhaust going with your AI oh but
that's how you're supposed to do it no I
just
yes true you could you could add more
fans at the bottom if you wanted to
I feel like feel like that might help
GPU temperatures a little bit not that
you would need it I mean that's a really
good cooler on that cart I've tested it
temps are pretty chilly already I think
that cable management needs a little bit
of help towards the top of the case it
just looks like you've got maybe a fan
cable going all the way across it's just
like all the way across I don't know if
there's any way to hide that it's really
obvious because it's a white interior
and you've got black cases so it stands
out like a sore thumb
but part than that I feel like at this
point you should also go with matching
fans for your eao like get to more
l-series fans put them on AI oh I
appreciate their Risha I actually feel
like your cable management is better on
this side then then on the nice big
plate yeah kind of like the dude two or
three rigs ago like cable management's
good but it could could be you're gonna
be better you're 90% there you're very
close
nice rig overall though I like I like
your choices I like the I like the color
scheme you've gone with with the RGB
lights and all I would I would
definitely get some like I don't know
cuz your specs are already pretty strong
like I would get some nice like black
and orange cable
maybe to match like the existing scheme
epic yeah that would with your
motherboard and that we obviously team
it up real nice
yeah that'd actually be really similar
to the all Asus build that I did which
was in the black was that in the Thor
what-what-what cases use or not the Thor
the Helios did not I thought I thought I
used doing all ice you spilled no I know
I did one in always know what cases
nevermind
ignore everything I say at the live show
yeah I take I take no responsibility for
it you know it was okay now I know I'm
confused it was cuz it was in the air is
the PCO 11 air oh not the dynamic weird
yes you 11 air yes that's the same
design in every that's got the mesh kind
of plastic front uh-huh it's like
vertical it looks kind of like that in
star and in Star Wars that the little
the sand people ride around in that's
that's a racist term Paul and I would be
very if you never used it again not the
same day very triggered right now not
the same people the there is again
you're just doing here this the Jawas
yes the jealous exactly the jealous I
wasn't talking about the sand people I
with javis and it's the sand crawler
that's mean side it's the same curly I
think time Chad knows exactly what I'm
talking about yeah they're correcting
you they're saying Jawa can you call
them by their proper names and not refer
to them as you know what the s word it's
in the movie I didn't using that as
doesn't have a black male it's in the
bag yeah you know there's a lot of
things in movies I mean we could use
them daily basis to descend people are
frightened for now but they'll be back
soon and in greater numbers they're not
a hive mind okay let's get irate the
Tusken Raiders
okay all right I'm looking at the air
now okay oh this case yes it's the same
exact right there
I just never how did you forget about
air no I forgot nothing okay you know
all right so one more we have Muddy
Waters be 350 bores in 1800 X Thank You
Shawn 32 gigs once again and of course
your rented Tramp em aside Vega 56 with
64 BIOS and we have in win 101 white ATX
case with a bunch of 120 millimeter blue
LED case fans from up evia a PBF all
right well it's pretty cool take a look
yeah those fans look nice I'd like to
see two more of those maybe one at the
rear and one on your seat people or you
could just get a brand new CPU cooler
that I don't know would be better for
your 1,800 X because that one looks a
little dinky I know that deep cool
cooler it's it's very basic very entry
level and put that on the rise in five
but I don't know about a an X Q flagship
Rison chip it is standing because the
rest this build is super clean yeah I
like I like how it's looking
I like the blue I like just MSI logo
standing out in the red there that is
standing out as sort of the more budget
part even though you know something you
know this isn't necessarily super
high-end you got an a/b 350 pro 4
motherboard and stuff but yeah it's one
of those cool in win cases that you look
at and like oh that's kind of different
yeah but yeah I'd like you to value
cases I can't complain about your cable
management it's it's pretty solid all
around yeah possibly could do with the
some better solution for your GPU power
cables I think you're dealing with a
daisy-chain situation there but it's
minor it's not standing out too bad yeah
the cable the cable from this rear
exhaust fan that's horrible
fix that gotta fix that the whole bill I
don't know what else sure anything else
to say
no all right good thank you guys well
that's John bet was Pitt my PC and that
is also the end of my half awesome
hardware so don't go anywhere we're
gonna switch over to Paul's half right
a link in the description to my YouTube
video or you can go to his channel
Paul's hardware and just stay where you
are if you're on Twitch because this
keeps name in there yes we right
well we were back ok right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
