channel today I am building a brand new
computer it's a custom water-cooled
build and it's actually the second one
that I've ever put together
apart from ol hot line back there the
reason why I'm building this system is
really just kind of for fun I guess it's
a showpiece it's not really meant to be
super functional I'm not gonna be using
it on a daily basis or anything like
that it's not replacing hot line no
one's really gonna be using all that
much it seems like kind of a waste at
first however I'm really just doing this
also to kind of get my feet wet a little
bit more when it comes to custom
water-cooled builds this is the only
other system that I've ever built that
features liquid cooling so I really
don't do this at all and I would like to
get more experience with it it's really
fun I really enjoy putting together hot
line so looking forward to this build as
well but that being said it is a little
bit different than hot line it's small
form-factor we're going mini ITX this
time around so we're dealing with a lot
less space but hopefully going to pack a
bunch of power in just the same and yeah
we've got a ton of stuff to go over here
guys so I'm just going to go really
really quick down the line and I'll put
links in the description to all this
stuff so you can check out more info if
you want but starting off with the water
cooling stuff we've got a bunch of stuff
from ek huge shout out to those guys for
helping provide all this awesome
hardware that Co did there
we got the ek cool stream PE 240
millimeter radiator we've also got the
xe2 for you so these are both 240
millimeter rads except this one's
slightly thicker than this one we're
going to see if these can both fit
inside of our case we'll get around to
that that we've also got some PE t g
tubing from ek so we're doing some hard
lining not sure if we're going to get
around to that doing all the bends today
but we'll see how far we get we've also
got two separate reservoirs here get the
res x3 and the x3 lights these are both
150 millimeters both same size however
they have different Inlet and outlet
configurations so I kind of just got
both to see which one would work better
for our loop we've also got some stuff
for the GTX 1080 and if you couldn't
tell we were using a 1080 for our
graphics card very sexy we've got a
backplate
for that as well as the water block
itself both from ek tonnes of fittings
just all kinds of fittings for the hard
tubing sleeve all these fittings this
a lot of freaking fittings we've also
got the pump we got the pump from ek the
ex top Revo v5 PWM so this is a lot
bigger than I thought it would be and
we're gonna talk about this more exactly
how we're going to fit that in we've
also got any case supremacy Evo water
block so this is the nickel-plated the
plexi one so you can see through it
where you can see all the coolant
flowing through it's really nice I've
also got some some aqua tuning fluids
can't forget coolant now I did
originally think this was gonna be a
slightly different color this is the
crystal blue and it's UV UV is cool I'm
hoping to hoping to get some cool UV
action with this build however I didn't
think it was gonna be this color I
thought it was gonna be closer to like a
light blue like like this SATA cable
here but it's more of at least in the
bottle it looks like it's just more of a
regular kind of deep blue it's kind of
go I want it a bit of a lighter blue and
just a color calamity here because I've
also got these awesome cables from cable
mod you can see my 24 pin extension here
however the blue in this is slightly
different than the blue on the SATA
cable and I like the blue on the SATA
cable a lot more so I don't know this
this is kind of like a baby blue I'm not
sure if I just pick the wrong color or I
don't know well we'll have to see how it
goes moving on like I said we've got a
UV action going on with the reactant
coolant so I've got a UV LED strip from
cable mod this is their magnetic 60
centimeter option GT X 1080 founders
edition is the only founder physician
card I have so I'm a little bit sad and
I was a bit apprehensive at first to
disassemble it for water cooling because
that means I won't have access to a
founders Edition card anymore unless
they buy one myself it's going to be an
arm and a leg but through it I've got
I've got enough 1080s over there I don't
care if they're not founders editions
banners founders is just and stupid I'm
just kidding it's a very good reference
cool EVGA has provided the the power
supply that's what this is 750 watts the
750 GQ modular semi module I should say
it's also got black sleeved cables like
I said we are going to be using the
cable mod extensions with thumbs to
cover up or just to add some more color
to the build we've also got some SSDs
from OCZ these are the Tryon 150s I've
got two of them they're both 480 gigs
now I would be ill-advised to run these
in raid 0 and install windows on it
because that's you know it's risky it's
risky one goes one drive goes down the
whole thing goes down so I'm going to
keep them separated for now we're not
going to raid them just yet but like I
said this is more of a showpiece and I
think
these SSDs are really going to match
aesthetically like perfectly with the
rest of our system so that's kind of why
I got them especially with the the Manta
case here we've got the NZXT Manta mini
ITX chassis in white this thing is also
really good for water cooling for custom
water cooling it's got plenty of
radiator support and things like that so
really excited to be building it I've
done a review on this case but never
really done a full liquid cooled system
in it obviously we've also got a 6700 K
really good CPU skylake and we've got a
motherboard we've got a motherboard a
z170 stinger from EVGA this is one of
the only color neutral z170 boards out
there for some reason
manufacturers don't like to make mini
ITX I should say mini ITX color neutral
z170 boards kind of a must have to go
with something that's color neutral
that's not going to clash with anything
else it doesn't have an MDOT to slot on
it unfortunately but like I said we've
got plenty of SSD storage there so it's
not too bad
that should be fun and then last but not
least we've got this this kid of memory
I was for so long I've been looking for
a scenario where this this memory makes
sense this is the Raiden series from a
vexer this is the one that has like the
plasma tubing LED lighting effects on it
looked all crazy and it's just
over-the-top ridiculous I finally found
a system that this was that this is
hopefully going to look great in so and
hopefully there's no clearance issues
because these heat spreaders are
freaking massive but those are all the
parts I'm kind of amazed that I got
through all that in such little time but
I really just want to get into building
this thing starting with I think we'll
start with actually taken off the
founders edition cooler here and
slapping on that water block because
reasons so let's do that now
all right so this is how far I've gotten
today and I'm pretty happy with the
progress so far however there have been
a number of challenges and obstacles and
just things that just flat-out didn't
work and I'm slowly quickly learning
that custom water-cooled builds nothing
really ever goes according to plan 100%
of the time and it's just about how you
solve it
just one problem-solving task after the
next so first off you can see I'm not
using cable mob cables right now because
I just didn't like the way they looks
the the color the cut the light blue
color was just not matching with the the
blue accents on the RAM and SSDs in
particular so I'm just going with some
white ones for now I'm not sure if I'm
going to keep these white or maybe
switch it up and add some more colors in
there maybe so maybe find the right
shade of blue I don't let me know what
you guys think I think the white could
work but I don't I feel I can go either
way so leave me some feedback in the
comments obviously the 24-pin ATX is
kind of hidden by the reservoir speaking
of which the reservoir is dangerously
close to that GPU block GPU block by the
way went on very easily but you can see
that there's just like look look at that
it's like what the hell is going on it's
like touching the left side but the
right sides perfectly hovering above it
but I don't know it also looks just kind
of weird I don't know if this looks
weird or if it looks cool and I think
I'm gonna have to put some hard line
tubing in and do the runs to really
figure out if I like the way this is
going because I don't know I'm really
bad at visualizing in my mind how
something is going to look in the end I
actually need to see it very visual like
that so I'm
I don't know it's kinda interesting but
yeah so so so that went in fine I
remember this is just a reservoir it so
I have the pump which is down there but
has has not been mounted yet I mean
we're going to get to that we're gonna
get to that the other thing that I want
to point out is that I very well might
switch out all these fittings at least
the main fittings here for the heart
tubing for some smaller ones because
what I've realized and Brian from bps
Kustoms shout out to him for helping me
with all this by the way go ahead and
follow him on Twitter he doesn't really
awesome work he suggested to me and I
completely agree that maybe going with
some thinner tubing might work
especially if I'm trying to hit these
really tight right angles like boom you
know and like and like boom boom then
that might actually be an issue if I've
got some really thick tubing which I
kind of do this is a 12 12 by 16 I don't
know if it's 12 by 16 but it's 12
millimeter inner diameter 16 millimeter
outer diameter I might go with something
like like 10 13 like something I did
with hot line which is quite a bit
thinner than this stuff and it would be
a little bit easier on the bends I would
imagine so that might also change might
have to buy some new fittings and stuff
but it's not too big of a deal also the
fan I swapped out the NZXT case fan the
stock one for this Corsair airflow the
AF 120 I don't know if it's if I'm
keeping it it may or may not stay
depending I was thinking maybe I could
spray paint the the the gray corners
here the the rubber rubber corners with
blue kind of a shade of blue might look
kind of nice or use a blue ring and
spray paint the the corner is white I
don't know which one do you like which
one you like better let me know another
thing that I want to point out was that
you can see right here there's only one
radiator in this case what the hell's up
with that yo I thought you had two
radiators count that you lied to me no
I'm not lying to you actually the the X
the X e to 40 which is over there the
really fat one was supposed to go at the
front and then I realized that's not
going to work because it doesn't leave
any room in this little basement door
here for tubing which I'm going to need
to pass some tubing here for the pump
down there so that's not going to work
so then I have to move the the PE the
slimmer radiator at the front here which
means I have no more room at the top
here for any radiators that one's too
thick to go at the top and as it turns
out this one was too thick to go at the
top too so
even this one was too big for its
initial purpose so what I'm gonna have
to do is buy another PE ek radiator here
but just even slimmer maybe go down to
like 25 millimeters I've got some really
good slim ones and then put that at the
top there I didn't know what the hell to
do with this pump because it's way
bigger than I initially thought and I
wasn't sure if I was actually gonna be
able to fit it in here and Brian had the
amazing idea to try mounting it at the
bottom of the case here in the sari the
NZXT mantas basement so something like
this
unfortunately the Manta doesn't have any
native mounting holes for a pump which I
really think it should maybe add Manta
2.0 come included with that so what
I'm gonna have to do is probably drill
some freaking holes let's whack up my
power tools over there got them a drill
bit box battery's all charged you see
that green light that green light you
see that green light that means we're
ready for action baby I'm gonna drill
four holes in the bottom of the case and
ek even hit gives you this handy dandy
sticker here see you put the sticker at
the bottom of the case and you can drill
boom-boom-boom those four little X's
that's supposed to align perfectly with
the screw holes on your pump I don't
have that much experience with power
tools I mean obviously a hang on
the wall and stuff with them but not not
so much modding however I feel like this
isn't too different than maybe hanging a
frame on the wall but we'll see let's
let's get right into it and see how
badly I messed this up
the pump is installed
Oh yep that deserves some epic victory
music right there
I actually went really smoothly it's
super stable I tried moving around it
won't budge at all so that's that's
perfect like I said before plenty of
room for the power supply cables and for
the radiator of course the front and
just cable management in general should
have no problem tucking away all these
uh power supply cables and here's a
quick look at the bottom I know I showed
you guys a second ago but here's just
another look here the four screws one
two three the fourth one is actually
hiding underneath this plastic foot here
I could have dremeled that part away but
it kind of fits over it just barely you
can kind of see how the plastic of the
foot just kind of goes up because whew
kind of like bows upward loop and it
goes up or up and around that fourth
screw there it's a tight fit but it's
not impeding any kind of structural
integrity or anything like that so I'm
happy with how it turned out overall I'm
pretty excited there's a lot still that
I need to do like I said and hardware
that I need to buy the top radiator
being one and new fittings and new
tubing and things like that but that's
pretty much where I'm gonna leave this
video for now guys so let me know what
you think of the progress so far if you
have any tips or suggestions or advice
anything like that or ideas leave them
down below in the comments I'm going to
read all of them because I know you guys
have some good ideas but that's all for
now guys thank you so much for watching
be sure to toss me a like on the video
if you enjoyed it subscribe for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon
have a great day and I will see you all
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
