awesomesauce news today I'm going to be
doing a quick little video essentially
benchmarking the EVGA gtx 770 super
clock and the reason for that is while
if you haven't noticed or if you haven't
been watching the new egg TV channel
lately I've actually been filling in for
Paul quite a bit just because he's been
in Taiwan for the last couple days so
I've been doing some unboxing videos
trying to offload some of the work that
he usually does for the channel so I've
been doing a lot of gtx 770 videos
lately especially since they just came
out but essentially from the cards that
i was looking at the one that caught my
eye the most was the EVGA gtx 770 super
clock not so much just because of the
performance well that too but all the
cards that i was looking at at Newegg
we're pretty much more or less the same
as far as specs go I mean there was a
bit of a difference between base clock
and boost clock frequencies just
depending on the factory overclock
settings that the manufacturer had used
but essentially it stuck out to me most
about the EVGA card was its aftermarket
cooler and I'm talking about the brand
new one that they just implemented into
their 700 series of cards
which is the active cooling extreme or
the ACX cooler as they're calling it so
I just kind of wanted to test it out see
how the thermals did and all around just
how the performance of the gtx 770 does
with today's high-end games so i tested
a few games today and then show them to
you in just a second here's some nice
footage b-roll of the card itself just a
really stunning looking cooler by the
way as well I think that's also kind of
what urged me to take it home and test
it personally just because it looks
really nice kinda has a very classy
elegant look to it and I'm I admit it
I'm a sucker for aesthetics but
essentially these are just some casual
benchmarks I didn't compare the card to
any other cards just because I'm pretty
strapped for time with Taiwan coming up
pretty soon I leave Saturday so I'm
trying to crunch a lot of things right
now but thought I'd get this last video
out there before I hop on a plane and
fly to Taiwan so that's it I hope you
guys enjoyed the benchmarks and here you
go
all right guys so those are the
benchmarks and what have we learned from
the results today well for starters we
can say clearly that the gtx 770 is a
pretty badass card and you should be
able to achieve very playable framerates
if not gluttonous frame rates for all of
today's to top games especially if you
don't crank up everything too far to the
max I remember cranking up Metro last
light just completely maxed out I think
I was getting like an average of 28
frames per second but essentially you
know you turned down a little bit of
anti-aliasing here and there or whatever
it is and you should be good to go this
is just a really good card and
essentially also I wanted to note the
cooler did fairly well as well but
essentially I was seeing temps and as
you guys saw in the mid 70s for most of
the games there were only two games
where the card actually achieved or
actually hit 81 degrees Celsius and that
was for BioShock Infinite as well as
Metro last light of course the card
didn't get hotter than that because of
Nvidia is GPU boost 2.0 basically all
the 700 series cards that come shipped
are defaulted at 80 degrees Celsius
temperature targets all the other games
were staying relatively cool pretty much
matching what my direct cu2 GTX 670 is
able to achieve so very impressive stuff
with the active cooling extreme cooling
design that EVGA has most recently
implemented into their 700 series cards
so glad to say that I definitely
recommend this card for anyone looking
for an upgrade or if you're just looking
to build a system
you're looking for some really powerful
performance with really decent thermals
definitely the EVGA GTX 770 super clock
is the way to go or at least one of the
ways to go but that's all for now guys
thank you all for watching this video
please subscribe the channel if you
haven't already send me a like and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
