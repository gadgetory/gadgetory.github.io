what's up guys welcome back to the
channel if you're watching this on the
day of upload Intel has just launched
its 8th gen core CPU family codenamed
coffee Lake and its new Z 370 platform
with the LGA 1151 socket I've spent the
last couple days testing the flagship
core i7 8700 K against its predecessor
the cable a core i7 7700 K and one of
its close competitors the AMD risin 7
1700 to see how the CPU stack up in a
gaming environment taking a quick
side-by-side look at today's contenders
the 8700 case for its two more cores
than its older brother and two fewer
cores than the rise in 1700 though it
does hold the faster turbo frequency of
the group while both Intel SKUs are
capable of hitting much higher speeds
than our AMD parts they're also packin
higher tvp's which may require hefty
aftermarket coolers especially if you
plan to overclock the Wraith spire
that's bundled with the relatively low
powered rise in 1700 however makes the
chip ready to use out of the box at no
additional cost to the user we are
dealing with a fully unlocked lineup
today but we'll be testing the CPUs at
their stock speeds with hyper-threading
and SMT enabled three separate test beds
were assembled for our Z 370 z 270 and X
370 platforms using the hardware and
drivers that you see here to keep our
test CPU bound I used a stock GT X 1080
Ti founders Edition for all games at
1920 by 1080 that being said I also ran
a few non gaming tests in order to
better position these CPUs overall so
starting with handbrakes the 8700 k
takes the lead by encoding a five-minute
4k file in 261 seconds blowing its
predecessor out of the water and
slightly edging out the rise in 1700
albeit with fewer cores and threats in
Cinebench rising takes home the multi
threaded victory beating out the 8700 k
by 10-percent with a tire core count the
8700 Cade trances the 7700 K by 39
percent this is the biggest single
generation leap in multi-threaded
performance that we've seen from Intel's
mainstream platform in ages
yay competition as you might expect the
8700 K wins in single threaded marks
here crushing the risin 1700 by a 41%
lead and beating the 7700 K by a smaller
margin already it seems the 8th gen hexa
cores are keeping pace with horizon in
both single and multi-threaded
performance something KB leg failed to
do earlier this year in 3d mark fire
strike Xtreme we see the 8700 K pull
ahead of risin by 6% with a modest 2.4
percent increase over the 7700 K
interestingly enough coffee like yielded
the lowest graphic score in the bunch
during this test kicking off our gaming
benchmarks with ashes of the singularity
the 8700 K secures an underwhelming
victory against the 7th gen flagship but
cuts through the rise in 1700 by 55% in
average frame rates and 62% in 1% loves
battlefield 1 tells a similar story
between our Intel chips though the
gained over Aizen is much smaller this
time by 6 percent as a CPU intensive
game it is nice to see
AMD keeping up in this title based on
the results in GTA 5 it's pretty clear
there aren't huge gains to be had in the
gaming department going from KB Lake to
copy lake but they do tell us Intel is
still the gaming champ by a landslide
the 8700 K tops the rise in 1700 once
again this time by 35% in average fps in
hitman 2 8700 k saw its biggest
improvement over the 7700 K with 1% lows
an average framerate scoring 11 - 12 %
higher here the new hexa core maintains
a fierce upper hand against risin by 40%
in average frame rates finishing with
Metro last light the 8700 K scores an
average FPS 26% higher than the rise in
1700 and 8 percent higher than the 7700
K reaffirming the behavioral patterns
we've seen thus far now if he breaks
down all of the average frame rates the
8700 K gets a 4.5% bump over its
predecessor meaning if you're currently
rocking a KD Lake system the upgrade to
coffee lake simply isn't worth it
for gaming performance alone only gamers
who have a need for streaming and coding
and other multi-threaded tasks will
likely see true benefits from switching
if this applies to you it is a damn
shame but you can't just pop a coffee
like chip into your 100 or 200 series
motherboard as the 8th gen CPUs do have
different pin configurations than their
predecessors compared to the rise in
1700 the 8700 k perform 26 percent
better on average which is significant
and while this certainly paints
coffee-like as the faster gaming chip
overall not many users are using a gtx
1080p i to game at 1080p like we did in
today's testing and the wide performance
gap you see here is bound to shrink with
a more realistic scenario that i may be
testing for you guys soon now if you're
not on any of these platforms at the
moment and you're trying to decide which
one to opt for it has to be between
Rison and copy lake since kb lake is now
officially a generation old if you only
care about gaming then copy Lake is the
easy choice however the answer may not
be so cut-and-dry when throwing
workstation tasks and encoding into the
mix and although that wasn't today's
focus this is something I'll be
following up with in a future video what
is certain is that you're gonna be
spending more money with the 8700 k than
you will with the rise in 1700 not just
because of the higher MSRP but most Z
370 motherboards will be inherently
pricier than AMD's be 350 offerings if
you plan to overclock not to mention
you'll need a decent aftermarket cooler
to handle the warmer temperatures of
coffee Lake now since most of today's
games are still heavily GPU bound coffee
Lakes added cost may not be worth it or
at least it won't have quite the priced
performance for which Rison has so
righteously raised the bar still if
you're just looking for the absolute
best chip for gaming it seems Intel has
no plans to hand over its title any time
soon but that's all I got for now guys
let me know what you think of these
results in the comments does this change
or confirm any expectations you had
about the new platform before you guys
go feel free to toss me a look on the
video if you enjoyed it and be sure to
subscribe to the channel for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon as
always I'm Cal abit wit thank you guys
so much for watching and I will see you
all in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
