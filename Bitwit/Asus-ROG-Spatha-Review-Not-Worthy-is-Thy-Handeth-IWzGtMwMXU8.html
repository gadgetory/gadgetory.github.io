wireless gaming mouse from Asus called
the rog spoda spay though better Luke I
am your father
ah got it the ROG spoda is quite
possibly one of the most beautiful mice
I've seen with enough features to make
you forget all about its 160 dollar
price tag good lord
this mouse better be on its hands and
knees by the end of this video but you
know what let's give it the benefit of
the doubt because who knows there is a
slight chance that this device has
enough magic over the competition to
justify the extreme cost so let's take a
closer look and find out if Asus
delivers or if they should consider
revising their tagline aesthetically
speaking the mouse is just gorgeous its
aggressive without being obnoxious and
it's got all the right curves to make me
want to I bang it all day despite the
body's plastic construction the overall
build quality is outstanding and there's
a metal plate inside the device that
makes it the heaviest Mouse I've come
across in ages this is totally a
preference thing but after a week of use
I still haven't adjusted to the heft I
also tend to lift my mouse a lot when
playing FPS games for example so the
sheer weight of this thing makes it
really difficult to me to game
comfortably in fast paced shooters
fortunately this wasn't as big an issue
in other game genres on top of weighing
a metric ton the spoda is also fitted
with a larger than average body whose
shape tends to favor palm users / claw
grip users laying my entire hand flat on
a mouse has always felt anything but
natural and truth be told I've been in
less awkward positions at band camp but
interestingly palm use feels great with
this device due to its shape and size
when resting my hand naturally the
rubberized side grips work as intended
and the outer support ledge keeps my
ring finger more comfortable than when
going my usual claw grip route after a
few days of use I've completely
acclimated as a palm rest user for the
first time ever which is pretty awesome
I just wish I could shed some of the
weight to operate at 100% comfort or
maybe I just need to do more
right-handed exercises I'll be right
back the mouse uses a laser sensor with
8200 dpi that's pretty much as precise
as they come these days and I haven't
experienced any tracking issues so far
another big selling point here is
wireless flexibility without
compromising on latency and battery life
and the solution Asus has implemented
for this is pretty solid the wireless
receiver plugs into your PC via a USB
cable and doubles as a charging dock
you can start topping off the battery
the moment you go afk that's right
unlike this kid the spotter rewards you
for leaving it unattended Asus doesn't
list the battery life duration on their
website but then again there's almost no
need unless you're gaming for days at a
time with no sleep to recharge you'll
probably never run out of juice at any
rate there's a battery life LED
indicator on the charging dock for at a
glance monitoring as well as a microUSB
port on the mouse for Wired use with the
included braided cable well it's nice to
have the tethered option I found my
gaining experience to be identical
whether opting for Wired or wireless
operation naturally a wireless
connection is bound to introduce some
latency but in this case it goes
unnoticed just like us gamers to the
female population it is worth mentioning
however that the mouse supports a 1,000
Hertz polling rate when used wirelessly
and 2,000 Hertz with a cable but chances
are you won't be able to tell the
difference in total you get 12
programmable buttons including the left
and right clicks which use
interchangeable Omron switches asus
includes a pair of optional switches
with a different click resistance that
can be easily swapped after taking apart
the mouse by unscrewing the base plate
with the included torque screw to be
honest the feature feels kind of
gimmicky something to hype up the
feature set while simultaneously upping
the price out of all the great gaming
mice I've encountered none of them
really needed this option they just came
with good switches out of the box which
is probably what most gamers want
between the left and right clicks you'll
find a rubberized scroll wheel with a
satisfying click and a 2-level dpi
button that I found to be too small and
hard to find quickly enough in a heated
situation and suddenly I'm reminded of
band camp again at the front edge of the
mouse are two buttons that are
programmed as your forward and back
functions by default which I reassigned
immediately for the amount of stretching
my fingers need to do to reach these
especially the front button they really
ought to require less actuation force
someone like the Hulk made beg to differ
but I probably won't ever use these
buttons unless my fingers magically grow
half an inch longer and the day they do
you ladies know where to find me
the remaining six side buttons on the
mouse are grouped together for quick
thumb access but the fact that they're
all different shapes and sizes makes
them seem counterintuitive however after
a few days of in-game practice I got
fairly used to the button layout with
the exception of the under sized middle
button which is hard to click without
misfiring the adjacent buttons another
gripe I have is up the clicks here are
nothing to write home about and I mean
that literally one time I wrote my
parents from college and told them how
much I loved Cherry MX brown
but yeah some of the buttons here
actually feel kind of stiff and could
stand to be a bit less mushy sure
they're tolerable but for 160 dollars
every click on this device should be
thoroughly satisfying now you probably
noticed by now that the mouse features
RGB lighting around the thumb buttons
scroll wheel and the ROG logo at the
back these three lighting zones are
individually programmable or can be
synced to display the same effect using
the ROG armory software there are six
preset effects to choose from and they
all look great and execution with
seamless color cycling color accuracy
would be perfect in fact if it weren't
for the white appearing a touch too warm
on the ROG logo and slightly cool on the
scroll wheel
the only LED feature I was expecting to
find but did not with speed adjustment
meaning you're pretty much stuck with
the slow default speed of the cycling
and breathing effects I think we've
reached a point in high-end RGB devices
where a few preset lighting modes just
doesn't cut it anymore
give me a seizure inducing light show
until I'm foaming at the mouth and now
we're getting somewhere
within the other tabs of the software
you can also adjust power options
increase the lift off distance record
macros and of course remap any button on
the device to whatever your heart's
content all of these settings along with
your led effects can then be assigned to
one of five custom profiles overall the
UI has a clean presentation the settings
are easy to adjust and the app runs
smoothly from what I can tell never
stuttering crashing or just plain
wigging out so what does all this mean
for the spoda as a whole both and being
honest I would consider it a good gaming
mouse and hands-down the most
customizable wireless mouse available
but at twice or even three times the
cost of its competitors the spa the
truly needed to leave my Joss meant it
to the floor in amazement which it
frankly did not do if you happen to
Jackson's and wipe your ass with
Benjamin's then you can buy this mouse
with confidence knowing it will serve
you well but for the rest of us feel in
that ramen lifestyle the gaming
peripheral market is simply too
saturated with competitively priced
gaming mice that granted may not have as
many tricks up its sleeve but we will
happily settle for that's all for now

thing on the comments and don't forget
