channel I'm Kyle and I am joined by my
wife Heather here today for this video
as you can see I am slightly inebriated
I've been drinking a delicious beer for
the last few hours but what we're going
to be doing today is she's gonna be
building her first ever computer so I'm
gonna teach her how but the caveat of
all this is that I'm gonna be drunk
actually I'm already drunk so I'm gonna
stay drunk and I'm gonna teach you how
to build a computer you're sober by the
way she's your how many drinks have you
had like one one likes to she's staying
sober because she needs to look after me
and she needs to make sure that I don't
take my pants off but I'm gonna be
drinking and I'm going to teach you how
to build your first-ever computer it's
gonna be great I think it's gonna be fun
it's already fun are you having fun
she's so britches having fun that's how
fun this shit is so let's let's let's
build ready ready go alright honey the
first thing you want to do this is the
motherboard I know what a motherboard is
but you do have to remove this black
piece right here that says Foxconn you
should never buy anything that's sold by
Foxconn because they're a terrible
company a good job how'd you I didn't
even need a teacher how to take it off
she just took it off you see that let's
do a replay in slow motion that was
beautiful
so first you need to open a socket you
have to push it down and then swing it
to the right you lift it up yeah right
there you never want to touch the heat
spreader you never want to touch the
silvery part green is okay now here's
here's a trick though now look look
there's a CD you want to match the
golden arrow
no what what arrow is that the arrow
that's okay maybe you're right I never
noticed a gigabyte imprinted on the
motherboard that's you just taught me
something usually I just look at the the
socket cover itself in this little arrow
but you just saw this amazing bloom I'm
like oh you want to force it and you
just want to you want to drop it as
straight in as possible oh no that was
horrible you don't want to scrunch it
there you go give it a little jiggle
just yeah there you go feel it looks
good just feel it
yeah jiggle tests complete drop that
lever down it's gonna be tight fit but
it's okay cpu installed Hey all right so
RAM note the RAM is Right memory wasn't
what's the memory what here from this
cable yeah yeah that's the memory all
right so we're going to install both of
those things
oh my god two servers for this here
right does it matter
mmm oh that beer okay you see how you
have how many Rams you have no we have
two Rams and how many slots do you have
oh yeah so what what's up with that
right so you're gonna want to use the
gray slots but hey wait there's latches
on both sides of the RAM slots there you
go see so okay try the other one now
you notice that there's a little a
little little little little thing
sticking out so you want to match that
up with a little dimple that's in your
on your RAM stick and then push really
hard down Wow Ram installed I need a
drink
next up next up we're gonna do the CPU
cooler now this has been known to be the
biggest pain-in-the-ass
install for most PC builders because
it's your first time build I chose a CPU
cooler that's especially difficult to
install that'd be fun yeah this is a be
quiet dark rock dark rock 3 dark rock
three dark rock 3 I need to pull out the
Intel bracket you're gonna need to pull
out these she said so go ahead and apply
a pea-sized amount of thermal paste
shake you're right make it centrical
yeah that's good
you're not supposed to be touching
anything I'm just looking at it stop
don't touch it we sweep behind it please
don't go in
so for the sake of easy mint we're gonna
not do this cooler because I think I
might be missing some pieces actually
instead of the dark rock 3 we're gonna
use this data rock slim reality I'm
drunk I can't be held accountable for my
ex okay there's no nuts that lets us
what these black days before this will
fit oh that's what it is do that yeah
you figured out how you teach me down
kiss me then go ahead and mailed that
sucker no yeah yeah that's good and you
want to like hold it up you want to
press it into the motherboard the plate
fall oh it's cuz it's not even through
the fuckin thing murdered huh possible
yes yes we put some more shit yeah
give me more beer all right now use the
nuts oh yeah she oh no that one now I so
bro this videos not gonna be as
interesting look
big ups I hate them I think it's stopped
I think it worked I was amazing thank
you maybe I shouldn't drink this yet
nope
do you think I'm drunk enough yes okay
what are you doing I see it tighten it
use that shitty wrench that they give
you
isn't it a shitty wrench yeah I tried
using it earlier to stuff it sucks this
is the word that's why I gave it to you
cuz I love you
it's just pure love and you begin to
music sorry I'm sorry
can we listen to Taylor Swift yeah yeah
but then Google will sue us
I hate Google haha wow wow are you done
are you done doing this no I'm fine
right there's not feel secure so you
know what
screw it it's done but we took the fan
the wrong way just unlatch that I'll go
ahead and mount that fan the right way
perfect no you're not dumb at all thank
you very smart okay take off side panel
of this define our five open that sucker
up just use you gotta use yeah so go
ahead and mount it in there now those
are gonna be your motherboard screws
you're just gonna use kind of gently
you're right yeah I'm gonna stop now to
install your power supply you basically
need full essential screws now I have
the four screws appropriated for you and
those aren't it honey let me tell you
there are four different screws there
you go sugar a mint of that baby
alright so don't stab me with that go
ahead and screw this ah she's screwing
the blouse ah penises way a lot slower
because you keep shaking the table and
bothering your comfy we're still
recording on audio we're still filming
on video we're still capturing on oh my
gosh alright old eNOS ah screw it just
manhandle it boy sit in that chair we
got that install cool let's install the
front panel connectors put it in this
one this guy right here now what you
want to do here is take this tray and
you want to line it up with the hard
drive that you have and then you take
four of those along those big-ass screws
two screws and women want all four of
them in there oh yeah and then screw the
SSD in which is the thinner one it's
more lightweight any more alcohol no you
don't need any more honey you know
you don't need any more I'm just doing
it for the fans now put it put it inside
no but to put the hard drive in the
thing
uh what good does it matter what yeah no
it matters you know yeah we're all
learning so much hey the little rubber
grommets look like Mickey Mouse nope no
you're right I think so either
my dad did it with NASA's feet oh yeah
that's fats so your hard drive and your
SSD now have power but guess what cuts
your motherboard and your CPU also need
power so you're gonna need to plug in
your 24 pin and your 8 pin EPS connector
so hey look at this beautiful grommet
here to put them those beautiful cables
through and it's just stuffing me just
stuff them in and then yeah fuck it it's
a party just all of them go through give
me that what no oh isn't I'm gonna
really drink it
there was a wrong way and a right way to
face it that seems very right to me
good job how'd you do that so quickly
moving on to the next parts the
muthafuckin fans why are you plugging
some fans right now so why don't you
plug that one in there yep plug that in
alright so now they're plugged into the
fan controller which is great
sita is basically a protocol everyone
had to lock him in to that guy stick him
in there yeah beautiful let's see we
could build a media building your
computer
we're building a computer no yeah oh my
god we're almost done no no we're
seriously almost done okay the video
card goes in this slot one of the PCI
expansion slots is still unless you
gotta take it out it's before yeah no
yeah take that out here's screwdriver it
makes it easier life is so much easier
with
will spool cover yeah and then look at
how much room you have no grab him and
put it in your bedtime I hate fit now
take the little PCIe cables and plug
them into that sucka I heard a click
okay so ballsack it looks like you're
practically done with the system here
honey I think you just built your first
computer but here is the ultimate test
I'm gonna go ahead and set it up and
connect it to a monitor and we're gonna
see if it boots up successfully because
that is the ultimate test to see whether
or not you fucked up all right moment of
truth ladies and gentlemen did my wife
build a successful PC and will it be
able to boot uh here here's the moment
of truth I suppose so
honey without further ado why don't we
go ahead after I don't know what the the
hour and a half to two hours it took us
to build this thing which isn't too bad
torture for you um an absolute treat for
me go ahead and try powering up the
system and see what happens go see what
happens see it okay things are happening
the fan is spinning if it's running
properly should indicate some kind of a
splash screen or box
Wow amazing so the system boots ladies
Julian here is proof it's working good
job honey
and good job me for teaching you how was
it hell was building your first ever
computer honey it would have been better
if you weren't so drunk but that I would
have defeated the purpose it wasn't bad
yeah it actually is good fun it's kind
of fun you can quote her on that ladies
and gentlemen ICPs clara polly was the
most frustrating part the CPU coolers a
bitch I wanted to just see both of us
struggle and how we would react to
because it's it's really not the easiest
CPU cooler to install um but that being
said it is known to be one of the most
hey don't pay attention to the rapid
editing this out but that's so important
ladies and gentlemen that is all I have
to say about this year video thank you
so much my beautiful wife go ahead and
toss me like if you appreciate the work
and commitment that my wife has gone
into committing to this project because
I know that she has definitely better
things to do with her time um but thank

excursion and thank you alcohol as well
for joining me and seeing me through
this this entire project thank you I'm
going to finish the rest of that bourbon
