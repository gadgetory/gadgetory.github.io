inch inch at their knowledge is just an
extension of our brain yes it's like we
own all of your wisdom ISOs how it works
I have an IQ of 800 people yeah okay if
only I could remember the bank account
number for my offshore storage account
in the Caymans
if only I needed millions of dollars in
it only I could remember that 1111 D 111
t1 it's episode 11 G where it's episode
11 t1 welcome everyone to awesome
hardware episode 11 t1 this is side B
that you're watching this is a live show
that Paul and I do every single Tuesday
at 5:30 p.m. Pacific right here on
youtube if you're watching this on
YouTube we also stream it to twitch in
full if you're watching on YouTube you
can go ahead and watch Part A if you
haven't seen it yet on Paul's channel
which is usually calm slash Paul's
hardware I put a link in the description
below of the video you're watching right
now assume you're watching on my youtube
channel and yeah we like to talk about
tech news we have a couple drinks
hopefully you can have one with us if
you're a legal drinking age and we'd
like to have some fun we do swear
occasionally but you know we do it with
purpose we do it with meaning and
hopefully you're cool with that
because this is intended for a mature
mature audiences only so on that note
let's just go ahead with our regular
plugs which are our stores so I'm
selling things on bit with tech slash
store you can also find that link in my
description below on the youtubes this
is where I'm selling things like hoodies
and shirts actually the bio splasher
shirt that I said was in stock last week
was not in stock last week and everyone
is mad at me lies but this week it is
back in stock this week is for sure back
in stock so they look it's a BIOS chip
getting flashed you're flashing your
bust it's hilarious a little bit
everyone should have one full and Paul
is also selling stuff on his shirt
Paul's hardware net you can buy the
famous pub glass that we usually drink
out of on Tuesdays but we're not today
because it's I think the one that I have
is dirty so we're drinking out of
different glasses there so like cleaning
you know face the damage that's not true
that is a great feature okay
it would be cool I probably they
probably sell better I was gonna get
super jealous with my shitty I'm
self-cleaning glass
I think clean this thing myself hey dick
alright
yeah it'll still hold liquid whether or
not you clean it that way
yeah that's good and you've also got
lots of shirts hoodies decals plenty of
things
anything good stuff yep and if you buy
something from both of our stores at
around the same time then you get a
small kickback for shipping because
shipping gets consolidated it's
automatically a small portion of it gets
refunded to you so don't be super
alarmed at the extreme shipping costs
off bet um but I'm not note I guess we
could dive into our first beer call
really quick they are drinking stuff
from Big Sky Brewing Company in Montana
we learned today Montana good all
Montana beer I'm drinking one of their
IPAs which is the the Big Sky okay I was
right I was I was worried that big sky I
was doing it wrong because it's a
brewing company and they be also have
the beer named big specials correct -
like when a band has the band's name as
a title of the album yeah I always
thought that was weird if I'm drinking
scapegoat - paleo that's pretty good
Paley like I dig it
and those of you who are donating in
chat in YouTube chat right now the super
chat we see yeah we're gonna answer all
of those or read off all of the messages
you've attached to those donations at
the end of this half of the ship so keep
them rolling in we'll get we'll get
around to you at the zoom deal one
hundred and eleventh episode yes of
awesome artwork the 1111 what do you
call it the 11 for 11 minute wait 11 be
one years old 11 t1 you guys it's so
hard for me to remember look as good you
will not hmm
in the year 11 t1 anyway before we go
off the rails even further let's dive
into tech news Zoe continuing where Paul
left off the first story that we have
here is about Nvidia quietly enabling
DirectX 12 for their Fermi based
graphics card right quietly quietly just
subtly just like
let me slip that it may just slip it in
as she says that's what she said
that's what he said I think because it
used to be like hey you need a 600
series curtains to do DirectX 12 yeah
and now you can do 400 series or 500
series so if or heat warmers I like to
call them they were able to just turn
that on they were they just like flipped
a switch but at the same time just
because it's DirectX 12 capable doesn't
mean it's DirectX 12 optimized good it's
not good it's not good sex I mean needs
it's got it on paper it's good it's got
DirectX 12 on paper it looks great but
when you actually put it to the test as
they did at WCC F Tech here thanks for
the article
it doesn't really hold up all that well
simply because the fermium hardware is
not the Fermi Hardware can't really take
an advantage of almost any of the
DirectX 12 features so it's not just a
driver thing because for starters they
actually released the direct extort for
Fermi cards with the newest 3/8 4.76
driver but DirectX 12 isn't just a
driver implementation thing all of a
sudden you patch it in you have DirectX
12 if so in order to optimize it sort of
has to be cohesive right you need the
software and the hardware since Fermi
was developed several several years ago
before DirectX 12 that doesn't really it
doesn't perform that great in DirectX 12
titles however it will prevent your
Fermi card from crashing out right if
running a DirectX 12 game yeah so that's
nice
particularly you know especially if it's
like lighter and stuff during the or
after that writing the tests at WCC of
tech they found that DirectX 11 actually
took a hit I'm sorry yeah there was a
hit going from DirectX 11 to 12 so
actually DirectX 12 being enabled on the
Fermi card sort of backfired in
battlefield 1 significantly going from
38 average FPS to 28 so that's that's a
pretty big drop right there so again
it's it's not just it's not only it's
not just that it's not optimized for
DirectX 12 but in certain titles you
might actually see worse performance
than if you were just using the DirectX
11 API so bear that in mind you'll have
to do some playing around if you if you
do own a 400 or 500 series card
have recently updated to the latest
geforce driver um yeah let's move on
move on google was find recently by four
four two four two point four two billion
euro damn that's a lot that's a record
that's a it actually says in the article
that's a record for a fine for promoting
their own shopping results so especially
if you're like punching into query for
like a blu-ray drive for example see
those those comparison the shopping
comparison right there yeah that's a
google google shopping is what it's
called google shopping and somehow it's
conveniently at the very top of the
search page but there's no other
competitor or ival shopping comparisons
in sight those are all pushed to the
bottom of the page or on on page 59 of
google's a search engine
those assholes because Google's just
trying to up their own game google
promotes google shopping by placing it
at the top all the rival comparison
shopping services are much lower in the
results where consumers do not see them
and this is something that's been going
on for quite some time so the who are
they called the this is article by
hexxus by the way the European
Commission is the one who put this fine
into place who stuck Google with the
fine saying what Google has done is
illegal under EU antitrust rules the
denied other companies the chance to
compete on the merits and to innovate
and most importantly denied European
consumers a genuine choice of services
and the full benefits of innovation so
this is trying to level the playing
field here saying hey look we know
you've got this awesome search engine
but to abuse it in this way where you're
we are burying your competitors results
your competitors services or goods or
whatever is is unfair and it's
irresponsible just from a business
standpoint an ethical standpoint so 2.4
billion dollars were fined was a was the
fine that Google has to pay now they
have 90 days to comply which basically
means if they don't I think it's like
they get charged like a late fee of five
percent of their overall asset value
which is like 172 billion
probably pay it within 90 days or comply
within 90 days otherwise are gonna get
totally screwed but geez he was there
the interesting thing it's Google's
shadiness over the years of doing this
has actually been effective
it's they've Google Shopping which was
formerly frugal and then later Google
Product Search
I remember frugal like no one used it
yeah it seemed like oh frugal like that
makes saving money right but apparently
it sucked
yeah and then Google Product Search beta
right and Google Shopping still probably
sucks the only reason why it's seen a 45
fold increase since 2008 is because
Google's been pushing it to the very top
of all these search queries whereas all
of the comparisons side the rival
comparison sites have dropped 85 percent
after Google's sketchy algorithm
demotions of such sites so you don't
like seeing Google behave in that way
neither do why what Google for first so
long seem you know like they they were
in a boom they had the they had the
whole don't be evil thing and whatever
yeah but I don't know they they're
caught doing more shady stuff in like
the past five years
yeah but they need work they need to be
held accountable indeed and hopefully
they will understand like for the most
part they they seem like they they
understand that aligning aligning their
goals with what the consumer wants to so
like it's win-win like they're usually
pretty good at doing that right but yeah
hopefully cuz yeah I mean people people
need to be able to trust Google yeah
otherwise that erodes and then and then
and then what are you gonna do auto
search can't search it on yahoo google
so they're so you know and trash now and
everything it's like they have to to do
right I know maybe they don't expect
maybe they can maybe they yeah I don't
want to be ashamed of
cuz like I wouldn't get an iPhone I'm
not gonna give an Apple product those
Google keeps doing shady I'm like
oh it's reflects negatively on my own
personal brand okay done being dramatic
but Google Google owned up your
looks like you
so good on you for that move it on here
though we've got risin 1600 the risin 5
1600 which I have been I think a lot of
us reviewers have been touting as a
great priced performance chip has
recently sky rocketed to number 2 on
Amazon within their best-selling CPU
list ok dethroning the Intel Core i5
7600 K I bet that puts a smile on every
AMD employees face no doubt this was
over the weekend over fourth of July
weekend and there are a couple caveats
here this does not necessarily reflect
well it's a really cool thing and kind
of a win a minor victory point for AMD
doesn't really reflect the overall
market share but does offer some insight
into the latest trends and the best
selling list it should be noted on
Amazon is updated hourly so it's kind of
changing all the time so I don't know
it's what I'd already be old it might
already be old news it might you know
7600 K might have relinquished its
throne or something or regained its
throne or whatever the 7700 K is still
in the leading spot the core i7 fork or
a thread part is still number one when
it comes to desktop CPUs on Amazon but
this is uh this is just sort of sort of
a reminder that Rison is doing very well
and particularly the risin 5 1600 I feel
like is a chip that for what - to 210
dollars depending on where you get it is
a great bargain I mean you're getting 6
cores 12 threads it's unlocked like all
the rice and SKUs are and it features
SMT compare that to the chip that it D
thrown to the i5 7600 K which is about a
hundred bucks more to fewer cores for
fewer threads and and you have to
probably and you have to buy into a z170
or z2 70 slightly more expensive
motherboard if you actually want to
overclock it whereas the motherboard
options for be 350 for example on a m4
side are pretty affordable
in comparison yeah so overall r5 1600 go
AMD yay
but different things are happening over
at Razer there they're actually filing
for a Hong Kong IPO or they hope to
hoping to specifically raise six hundred
million dollars dan six hundred million
dollars which is a lot of money so Razer
wants the shell set sell shares on the
Hong Kong stock market to raise a lot a
lot of giant amount of money techCrunch
reports the latest round of funding from
venture capitalist investments a valued
razor at two billion dollars which seems
like a lot and it is that's a lot of
money but razors had an interesting
recent history it actually hasn't
according to the article has not made a
profit the company has not made a profit
since 2014 where it made twenty million
dollars pretty healthy and then 2015 it
posted a loss of twenty million
so all the 20 the 20 mil it gained in
2014 was lost a year later and then in
2016 it lost nearly sixty million
dollars of revenue and I think Paul you
had mentioned this earlier before we
started shooting the show is that razors
also sort of been investing a lot of
money just in different arenas and even
in their own you know technology and
that is that that's my assumption you
gotta spend money to make money so this
is and razor in all for all intents and
purposes it's still a pretty early
company it's pretty young company so
there it still has a lot of potential a
lot of time to grow so it's not
necessarily that you know razors doing
horrible or very like the you know
they're going to because they
haven't turned a profit but it is
something to take note of for potential
investors um so why Hong Kong why why is
razor interested in a Hong Kong IPO why
do they want to sell shares on the Hong
Kong stock market
well razor claims to be one of the top
gaming accessory accessory brands in
China and the company also has ties to
Hong Kong tycoon li kai-shing who owns
Hutchins Hutchinson when poet three
mobile also known as three mobile which
I have no idea what that is and VC firms
horizons ventures he just sounds like a
super-rich dude who's willing to just
drop a lot of
money on economy like racer and
apparently maybe he and Liam Ming Chang
min Liang 10 manling 10 and just as I
said our good buddies or something like
that and made probably maybe because
some some handshakes worked out maybe
they go way back hmm
other details about the IPO for those
interested it paid fifteen million
dollars in an all shared deal to acquire
next bit this earlier this year so next
bit I think they have some like
cellphone or a smartphone technology
stuff under their belts and this was
already known this is an article that
came out earlier but the actual amount
that Razer paid was undisclosed was
unknown until now 15 million dollars
that's how much the acquisition for next
bit was how much it cost the Fraser
doesn't seem like that much no no not at
all I got that that's chump change the
IP know the IP a doc also shows razor to
reveal its first smartphone close to New
Year's so we could be seeing a razor
blade plus or a blade blade phone I
don't know what they would call it but a
razor phone I don't know would you buy a
razor phone if it had RGB if it had it
would need to have our GP I would be so
disappointed if their first phone does
not have some semblance of RGB I don't
know razor and in some ways that's kind
of like that dark apple vibe you know
like like they do some pretty clean
products they have some very nice you
know tooling and finishing and stuff
like you know we both have razor blade
notebooks that are very thin and and
light and all that stuff they can also
be pretty expensive
you know comparatively for the hardware
that's inside and everything so I don't
know um I I don't mind when there's more
selection and more options out there for
for something like a razor phone it
would depend a lot on what harbor's
inside what it actually looks like what
the price actually is there's some weird
like custom UI over the yeah I know my
Android yeah like I don't like that I
don't want my I don't want my phone to
hit let's I don't want my phone to have
this on the back yeah let's just say
that no I don't want that razor yeah
anyone
I don't know if it was our GP I wouldn't
mind it I'm serious if if I could
disable the LED or if I could make the
LED any color I wanted then you did I'm
Way more okay with it yeah yeah okay if
we can turn it off yeah that makes more
sense true or you know most people are
just gonna get a case for their phone
anyway so you could cover it up that way
too but that does kind of make sense as
far as you know the amount of investment
they apparently have been doing into R&amp;amp;D
and that kind of thing if they are
trying to make a push to get into the
cell phone market yeah it's a hugely
lucrative industry if you can do it
right and and Razer has a lot of
experience already manufacturing
finished goods so yeah there you go yep
so we'll see um I guess we'll be
following that story closely as we
approach the end of year let's move on
to our next segment though which is hot
and heavy hardware where we talk about
hardware that's hot and heavy it's
pretty self-explanatory a segment here
um the first story with Shanna but oh no
we ran out of memories you only have
eight gigs of memory on this theater
eight gigs of memory in this computer
wait is it just a single stick since
when do I only have eight gigs I can't
see anything
hold on wait I have two four gig sticks
in there are we out of memory just this
I built this system like two years ago
almost three hours ago this chrome crash
says Google Chrome ran out of memory
while trying to display this web page
okay this is literally the first time in
eleven hundred and one or eleven 100
what's the what are you 11 D 111 t1 why
can't I remember that no in 11 t1
episodes this has never happened
technically it's around 50 or 60
episodes 50 five episodes of people this
yeah whatever I mean no I mean task
manager looks perfectly fine though it's
the only 48 percent eight gigs have
installed ran this also has an eye-fi of
6500 yeah I should probably get an i7 in
there
all right we definitely can't switch to
the fourth the 1080 60 over here then no
not not streaming to both places I would
not do that anyway but it's we've never
had issues with it before it's there's
the area I just go see everyone thinks
because they're like tech tubers they're
like even slightly well-known that like
every system we have is like you know
$5,000 with like the highest and
no I've got a core i5 locked processor
yeah but I stream to every other week's
gonna go with what works you know what
you have you gotta make use of it
we're source will do okay the nor me PC
guy alright um this is about AMD
launching their enterprise level rise in
pro CPUs most of us are like meh it
doesn't have much to do with gaming at
all but it's still worth noting this is
the first line of desktop CPUs from team
red that's aimed a professional at the
professional workforce since bulldozer
which did not take off very well due to
its lackluster performance so hopefully
they can turn things around here
the rise in pro CPU is pretty much think
of them as like almost like parallel in
terms of like specifications as the
consumer grade rising the CP is that
launched earlier this year that we're
all very familiar with for the most part
at this point but it has boosted
security extended warranty to like 36
months and just much more protection for
the end-user and lots more reliability
of course as well so they do a lot more
testing with it things like that other
items of note here component longevity
image stability support it supports
security standards such as secure boot a
firmware trust platform module TPM TPM
and a little header that TPM header p.m.
header TPM header on your motherboard
that's what that's for and various
windows 10 enterprise security features
though not all of these are limited by
Pro Class CPUs again 36 month warranty
as opposed to I don't know what's what's
the warranty on a consumer-grade resin
CPU a year isn't it I don't know I don't
know that's more CPU warranty really
don't you know and my recollection or
three years ok retail box CPUs are
usually three it must be shorter than
three years for the for the
regular rise and stuff it could be
that's what they're staying here but
another cool thing about risin Pro is
that it tells us a little bit more about
risin 3 on the consumer grade on the
consumer side because they did launch
some rising 3 Pro processors the 1,300
and the 1200 1300 will have 4 cores 4
threads based on boost of 3.5 and 3.7
gigahertz respectively and a 65 watt TDP
the risin 3 Pro 1200 which is slightly
lower end will have again for course and
threads 3.1 and 3.4 gigahertz
respectively and again the 65 watt TDP
so because all the other risin Pro
processors that are sort of the lateral
equivalents of consumer grade risin
processors have very similar specs most
people right now are assuming that we
can draw a lot of strong conclusions or
parallels between the risin three Pro
CPUs and the risin three consumer-grade
parts which makes sense which makes
sense it's not it's not a full full you
know it's not a half percent certain but
it's looking pretty promising for now um
and AMD said the manufacturer warranty
is also three years for the standard
resonant CPUs that's weird at least
according to Intel I'm sorry according
to new eggs warranty specification
limited warranty for parts and labor
both three years which would be separate
from the new egg return policies which
are different from warranties a warranty
is what you get from a manufacturer I
actually set up a lot of these systems
for how doing displays these on the
website
you didn't yeah but you're not doing it
anymore so this clearly can't be trusted
but they're using as a lot of the stuff
that I helped build is still there sorry
I some even even after you're dead
you'll still the sometimes I look at
something like oh those deliver on and
do it I'm limited warranties of
merchantability and fitness
but yeah so there's they're taking
essentially the same cores they've done
more validation and
providing return policies and assurances
that make it much more likely for IT
people who are building systems for a
workplace or something like that to to
use these Pro versions of the CPUs yeah
so they're they're they're creating a
product very similar but slightly
tweaked it's more appealing to that
segment of the market which is still
pretty substantial segment of the market
especially for companies that need
workstations for employees that aren't
necessarily gonna be spending you know
two or three grand on a workstation you
just you need something that gets the
job done but that's fast enough for
modern-day tasks right that seems like
pretty viable option for that indeed um
so that's fun next up we've got some
notes about the Samsung Galaxy Note oh
eight not seven that one blew up not in
a good way so this is from WCC of tech
so grain of salt alert the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 is one of three highly
anticipated flagship phones here in 2017
among the iPhone 8 and the Google pixel
2 which makes me sad because then I'll
feel very outdated for having a pixel
one and the pixel 2 XL no I know it's
not rumors rumors rumors rumors are
noting that the Galaxy Note 8 will sport
I put wills port like who's will port of
his are we talking about well sport game
do it will sport a dual vertical rear
camera which is a common flagship phone
feature however it is going to be a
samsung first so finally they have
hopped on the bandwagon for dual rear
camera cream publication
Osen or OS en quotes a source working
for samsung whose got the scoop on their
upcoming phablet 32 gig storage option
that used to be there will now be
removed in place of 64 gig and 128 gig
options oh good that's nice I hate I
hate base level storage options me too
they are completely point
and rebuff users can upgrade even
further to 256 gigs if they want to use
a microSD card
oh it's got a micro SD card slot they
brought it back according to the rumors
according to the rumors on WCC F Tech
mind you but still excitable Samsung
doesn't even exist does it it's not even
a real company this article is posted by
a bot Rama Sh you're not even real
Rob this actually I'm not familiar is
rubbish I don't i sees a new is this a
new writer it's a new but it's not
khalid mehar halide or me spot what if
they were just so blatantly obvious
about it like his name was Remy spot
it's like that or it's like the my
article is from Colleen God lead lead
okay
the 6.3 inch device will allegedly ship
with six gigs of RAM with snapdragon 835
Exynos 88-90 5 processor there'll be a
rear fingerprint sensor very much like
the Galaxy s8 and the Google pixel the
price is probably the most outrageous of
all it's $1,100 allegedly which makes it
the most expensive mobile device in the
market ever for smartphones yeah that's
what the article says storm YouTube asks
is it waterproof for that much money
friggin better be yeah apocalypse proof
better be fireproof IP 69 what is it at
the highest IP rating IP 68 I I P 80 IP
money colours IP freely
hopefully it doesn't explode when it's
unveiled in New York City on August 26th
according to the rumor issed which is
now a word I've invented the one rarest
yeah someone who spreads rumors oh yeah
that makes sense
there are numerous room wrists make a
rhyming haiku just I wish I was that
winning be humorous okay
but that's exciting I guess if you're
looking for if you're in the market for
a new phone and you want to go Android
because again apart from the Google
pixel Samsung's your your only hope no I
guess you got the one plus you get the
one plus five plus five it there you go
Motorola still do anything I don't know
I've I've seen I haven't actually
watched any of the reviews on the
oneplus five yet mmm I've only seen them
as Taylor did I know I'm aware that it
exists yep the thumbnail and I looked at
his thumbnail that's in there five hours
beautiful okay let's move on to our next
story though there's an assault rifle
inspired PCIe nvme SSD some people just
like to take their SSDs and their inner
components way too far I don't know
though is this too far let us know this
is an article from hexxus about Taiwan
memory maker a pacer who launched their
PT 920 commando PCIe nvme SSD which
comes in 240 and 480 gig flavors pcie
3.0 by 4 nvme SSD is designed after
assault rifle with details like sight
aperture and ejection port most people
are saying it looks like a stapler or
like one of those heavy duty like handle
staplers if you scroll to the very
bottom your your hand goes here yep
right here yes absolutely if you scroll
the very bottom it'll show you a picture
of it actually installed the motherboard
which looks nothing well I just staple
your motherboard looks nothing like an
assault rifle whatsoever it's very
confusing why I don't know this is not
the first time that manufacturers have
dabbled in this the article mentions
gigabytes and they're their sniper
series are the their assassin series
yeah where where you'd have like a heat
the heatsink would be like in the shape
of a gun or a rifle or like there'd be a
knife somewhere on the mother
or actually looks like a gun but it
looked like a gun it looks real I didn't
look real but it looked it looked you
could tell immediately from looking at
it what it was what it was intended this
is this is like rose gold it's like a
rose gold staple gun yeah why not black
and congratulations for making your what
could potentially have been a low a low
profile hath high card in June no longer
can be that with whatever this top thing
is right sometimes you know you
sacrifice function for form sometimes
and that's what they've done here
apparently it's also not the fastest SSD
but you're probably gonna pay a premium
because they had to make the stupid mold
for the dung like the body of the of the
rifle or whatever gets sequential reads
reads and writes of twenty five hundred
and thirteen hundred and fifty megabytes
per second respectively compare that to
something like the samsung 960 Pro which
kind of blows out of the water at thirty
five hundred and twenty one hundred
megabytes per second respectively
ya know pricing and availability no
pricing and availability does not shoot
real bullets which is a disappointment
and comes with a three year warranty
which I guess isn't bad but you know
it's an SSD you don't really need a
ridiculous crazy the G one assassin yes
and your thank you Simpson 11:42 gaming
in check did you want assassin that was
a gigabyte yeah yeah you guys know about
it yeah so I don't know I feel like this
is definitely a little bit gimmicky a
lot gimmicky there's something to be
said before making something that's a
little out there to get more eyeballs on
your product yeah when everyone's
looking at it and only getting eyeballs
on it because like that is absurd a
stupid yeah alright moving on to
something a little bit cooler in hot and
heavy hardware we're taking a quick look
at the Galax gtx 1060 x'q or extreme OC
white to the exo seen in white a six
gigabyte model this is from pc
perspective our good friend ryan Shrout
has written this article i just kind of
picked this article so that we could
just like ooh and AW over this card
because it's just it's it's Galax it's
all whites they make the best white GPUs
I don't care what anyone says in the
industry so that
do you get the beautiful white shroud
and back plate which is also white you
get a black PCB trying to get these
pictures so we can see them okay um the
back plate by the way also doubles as a
heatsink so it's mixed soms direct
contact with some of the elements on the
PCB which is always nice the fan blades
are semi opaque with white backlit LEDs
as you see there and it looks it just
looks so super sexy um as Ryan tripped
as Ryan mentioned it's a love it or
hated affair on how aggressive you like
your your shrouds I personally don't
mind it I think it's tastefully done
doesn't look overly done you can see
three heat pipes sticking out there from
the where the GPU is radiating a cheat
and it's it's a nice little slim little
card it doesn't take up too much space
it's got a single 6 pin connector which
is the reference the reference option
and video outs include I also like that
just that the backplate is now just
white because I know like on the older
generation last generation of Galax
cards they were actually like silver
back plates they weren't like fully
white like the rest of the shrouds which
annoyed me for some reason so I don't
ever want to pull these stickers off the
stickers we were the first thing to go
yeah definitely the first thing to go
video outs include dual DVI one HDMI and
DisplayPort so that would be HDMI 2.0 B
and DisplayPort 1.4 I believe so yeah
you've got your pick of the litter there
for video outs just if you were curious
Ryan was quickly able to push the
factory overclocked card even further to
2 gigahertz like right on the dot like
1999 megahertz all while maintaining low
temperatures under 70 degrees Celsius
you can see here I think that's an idle
temperature readout so that's much lower
but it's overclocked yes that is
overclocked so slightly below the I'm
sorry the performance was slightly above
reference gtx 1066 gigabyte models and
slightly below the AMD rx 580 which is
pretty expected it's right where you
expect it to be
availability in the US as is the case
with most galaxy cards there are is very
late about three of them and their 650
dollars each
yeah and two of them just got bought
right now so hurry last ones gun shits
are well happens every time you know you
guys had you guys had a window there I
know had a window you guys gonna be
quicker on the draw pricing when don't
they say MSRP or anything no me not that
it wouldn't matter cuz yeah I can't get
anyway no it doesn't matter no pricing
is unavailable or not listed so um
pretty card it's pretty good that's a
nice seeing a visually appealing card
and you know at a more budget range
mm-hmm you know it's got plastic on
there but they I feel like there's ways
to do plastic that's more tasteful than
others yeah well there's it's like
plastic has a quality too right yeah
there could be like I've seen some
really quality plastic on some
video cards before like expensive video
cards that had shitty quality plastic
like just like cheap flimsy right it's
got like lots of flex no sanding names
right now but then I've also seen like
really good-looking plastic high quality
you know sturdy stuff that's a little
thicker doesn't flex as much kinda even
looks maybe like it could be brushed
aluminum or steel from afar so other as
I agree there's a way to do plus it
tastefully and still keep costs down
right but um let's move on shall we
we've got some other stuff to talk about
here that's like like friggin face-off
these are free shop we're doing face up
yeah
I think should we I thought we were
doing mail time let's do mail time we do
face off next week well oh you were okay
what see what time did I even I don't
know I don't wait how do we start
streaming my half about 45 10 till 10
till yeah 6 vide okay then we're and
then we've still have 20 minutes
let's do mail time and then if we have
time we'll do faceoff afterwards so mail
time Nathan no sad you guys are awesome
and you sent me and Paul some stuff so
we're gonna open it up on stream right
now we don't know what you sent is
probably I think most of them are
letters
now all of them oh this one's got
something in it Sun is blinding this
one's to you lay it so this one arrived
to my p.o box my pl box have him he
hasn't been getting too much love lately
but it's because I don't really publish
the address very many places publish
read read I've started adding that in
the description of videos so it's
available now so all things my PA boxes
PL box for three to five Diamond Bar
California nine one seven six five in
case you guys are interested and this is
from mark from Ohio Markie Martin let's
it's in here something and honestly like
a lot of the things that you guys send
me to my feel box did I have more stuff
this week than Paul a lot of this is
addressed to both of us anyway so I
would not be surprised if you know
whatever we have like just tons of money
for both of us we can split what is okay
that looks I don't like that you know
it's just a small package completely
wrapped in electrical tape yeah but what
if it's like a bomb well it's probably a
bomb bomb the bomb bomb bomb I don't
know what to do with it though we have a
lot of haters actually I have a lot of
haters she's got no haters they probably
look what's that in there knowing that
you would it unboxing next to me is it
like a is it like a tesseract are you
gonna unwrap it there's gene Simmons
there's buttons these like buttons
I have no ideal it is it heavy no I know
it's really light there's a it's it's
it's a box its boxing something yeah
this is you have a do you have a a
straight edge or a razor blade or
anything yeah
I'll try to disassemble it I think
what's up in this this next one better
be worth the payoff what's his name
mark mark it better be worth my time I
hope I'm supposed to be doing this I'm
really not sure even you're probably
ruining his gift right now all right so
I'm gonna open up this while you do that
this is from no one and they even wrote
they even like typed up maybe this is
like a ransom note or something because
they didn't even write out my address
it's all they think about we get the
creepiest mail we know sue it's super
creepy well nervous now all right here
we go
and they even typed up the letter and
make sure there's nothing make sure
there's no money inside no okay
completely optional computer questions
oh okay there's some questions is the
gtx 1080 suitable for 4k gaming I mean
depends on the game I'd say a 1080i just
be safe but what's your recommended
maximum response time for a monitor
maximum maximum response time
recommended maximum like what would you
not go past and I don't know I feel like
that's sick maximum is weird I would say
minimum
I mean minimum 60 response time not
refresh rate first month's time so like
I don't know like 6 to 8 milliseconds
like 8 milliseconds you pushing it yeah
I'm six milliseconds I generally don't
knows too much it's a personal it's a
personal thing though your eyes are
different than mine 6 milliseconds aim
for 6 milliseconds if you're going for
like an IPS display which most people
are these days
you're pretty good you're pretty good in
that range more or less unless you're
super sensitive a safe voltage maximum
again with the maximums was this guy up
with some of this guy in maximum safe
voltage maximum for a risin five 1600
I'm not - au 12s I think they recommend
not going over one point 4 volts AMD
does yeah
that's their that's their cap they
recommend don't go over for one point
for which you should be able to
overclock to three point eight three
point nine no problem with the stock
voltage but thank you this is a
processor thank you sir
your name is Panos oh wait the name bit
wit is great but I'm going to be honest
I preferred awesomesauce Network also
say hello to Heather I appreciate your
your candor your honesty thank you very
much - but I'm not changing the name
ever
because I already change it like three
times yep you've used up all of your
like you gotta wait at least another two
years for the cool down on at least at
least two months uh whoa it's a CPU wait
what was in it wait what was it in is
like the subs in case it's like the
housing of a cell phone
I knew it or something like that I
that's immediately what I thought when I
felt the buttons yeah and I was like but
it's not big enough to be a cell phone
case and this is an AMD sempron
processor which she included in there
was a functional I believe I mean the
pins all look good I believe this is uh
I can I can probably look up and see
which actually little little guy that's
pretty cool
those are like ten pins on here layout
durable well you can count the pins on
one hand
sempron oh it's so soft
I mean soft in the middle you need to
look at the code on it like a baby's
bottom
all right I'm gonna open up the next one
this one's from some dude retweet
eat wheat oh yeah yeah
do you t3d oh someone sent me like a si
from the nums team my goodness
wait greetings from the gnomes teamwork
it's stapled there's multiple pages here
we're thrilled to introduce nums an
ultra-thin device that transforms laptop
trackpads what for more in summation
it's a product pitch please see the
material I was getting product pitches
no no no I can't do this you need to pay
for this yeah I charge my we we charge
money for these things I can't just show
your product for free terrible
businessman this is one of the things
that this alright so this was one of my
major concerns about for publishing the
P o box publicly yeah is your like
eventually you're gonna start have just
like crappy Bluetooth speakers just show
up China never get those energy drinks
that one time yeah so that's they drink
all of it but this is like a product
pitch look they ran out but they want a
Red Dot award also the CPU I'm not sure
if the CPU is functional or not I can't
really tell from it made a it seems
potentially functional inner this is an
AMD sempron
2400 plus so 24 plus rated speed 1667
megahertz actual speed socket a
introduced in July 20 2004 and this only
cost sixty one dollars even when it was
first launched yeah it's a it's a Sempra
the some problem was their budget line
Athlon would have been the high end but
yeah
k7 architecture and 32-bit it's a 32-bit
processor so it does not have 64-bit
capability single core single thread
this is 2004 was until 2005 2006 it dual
thread started being a thing also they
sent me a product to business
thank you Mark for the processor okay I
want a processor I've got lots of
processors now well it's a protective
film for saying you're I'm not gonna
give you exposure on my no you're right
cream you're writing them plenty of
exposure no I'm not actually that means
anything any other potential proselytize
again I will definitely not say anything
about your company or your brand on the
live stream I'm just I'm yeah I'm just
sort of interested Janice saying that
unbox therapy did a video we did a video
on this really a familiar with it I'm
botched therapy yeah over there I don't
know unbox therapy I only watch his
videos like I don't want like 10% of the
time now yeah usually used to be like 90
percent usually it's just like how did
he make a thumbnail and phrase the title
of this video to get people interested
in watching a video on this really
shitty project yeah let's see we'll see
that's exactly what I've been doing for
the vlogs thumbnail and title wise but
at least the contents there yeah I spend
more time editing any of the recent
vlogs than I do most tech videos to be
honest they're entertaining yeah and at
least they're entertaining and it's not
just like a blatant paid advertisement
that's like five minutes long yeah but I
digress well what's next let's open up
one more let's open up one more for mail
time this is from Phoenix
what's that his name that's where he's
sent from this is from Phoenix Phoenix
did not list a name on the envelope
perhaps it is in the letter geez
do you bid wit my name is Kyler no are
you my long-lost doppelganger that's a
mixture of two names these units put
together it's me and you Kyler it's me
and you from now on I'm looking to build
myself a computer it is not necessarily
for gaming but some light games like
Metro last light also I'm not gonna
overclock budgets around 600 bucks if
you can look at the parts there on SWS
also no graphics card I am NOT a gamer
okay and help me figure out which ones
would fit my budget that would be
awesome here's my esta SWS
what's that study less I'm password
don't share this with anyone else email
tight oh sorry I shouldn't say that yes
Annie was a bacon on this wsco a busy
day should I go for Intel i5 or Rison 5
if you're not gaming go rising 5 when
you're done email me yet said email
address thank you so much thank you
Kyler thank you um-hmm
ok I'll check it out I will give it a
gander since you took all the time and
effort to actually send me a letter
which i think is respectable I'll check
it out later that's why I'm putting it
right here on my keyboard so I remember
it um but that's the one conclude for me
all time I think yeah let's go ahead and
let's see what's it's 7:45 right now we
started the show almost an hour ago we
should probably just dive into donations
and stuff ok we can save again I
remember we postponed last week's face
off to this week and we're postponing it
again to next week
well I mean face off usually it's
supposed to have a punishment that
affects us through throughout the show
true true disappointing for people it
would be wasted yeah you still you still
never fulfilled your punishment for two
three weeks ago though that I did which
was which was death you're still alive
clearly you need to deliver on that all
right well next time
next we'll come back to all right let's
talk about let's go over some donations
here ah let's see Zurich yellow house F
you're getting wet it's so hot outside I
did you a favor
alright automatic Matt for the two bucks
wish me luck on my army physical on
Monday good luck automatic Matt Matt
yeah hopefully they don't cup your balls
too hard
Corey pertain $5 hey Paul and Kyle
absolutely love your channels and live
show I'm upgrading from has well soon
should I wait for coffee lake Cheers um
if you don't well I don't know honestly
has well still pretty good man
as well not like old stuff so I would
wait just for the hello since since Iran
has well and makes sense to wait since
you don't need
upgrade soon or anything so yeah I'd
hang out and see what happens for this
this year yeah and plus if you wait then
you can potentially buy at a time of the
year towards like Black Friday time when
there's more sales and good deals true I
think coffee Lakes kind of fascinating
or it's kind of interesting in a way
because it's the first time and so long
that Intel is launching a CPU in
response to serious competition from a
and B yeah it means like like like
they're gonna pull out all the stops I
feel for coffee like so as opposed to
the last few generations I also feel
like I'm already a little a little like
like standoffish with it because it's
supposed to be you know they're bringing
a six core CPU to the mainstream
platform I don't know if it's gonna be
exactly LGA 1151 again or what I don't
know what they're doing with the socket
but if it's a six core in their
mainstream platform that would be
exciting like oh they're firmly updating
to that but that's already been tainted
by them doing four core on their
high-end platform yeah so it's like even
more of an overlap now but true you know
if they can make it competitive and it
works well and it's in an overclocked
swelled and you know maybe maybe maybe
the 7700 K right now will be replaced by
a coffee leak whatever that is
six chords at overclocks really well and
yeah it could be good who knows 80 80
800 K yeah something like that
core I hate all right moving on oh we've
got the one from Scott Dilbeck Scott
Devitt from the 6.66 sense chug chug
chug I'm gonna get a t-shirt in a minute
I want to be on pimp my PC ladies I know
you've seen them tweets Kyle um maybe I
have maybe I haven't who knows there's a
lot of submissions that come in to tell
my PC but I guess we're gonna check this
right now
apparently all right have no one else
asked this
cuz that's all my beer that's it
that is it thank you Scott
thanks God for that prompted chug uh
baby China reach out for the $5 a
donation being subscribed since your new
8 day tearing me not to donate suckin my
bow I would not be a techie what house
are you two can't stay off to the gym
bye see him thank you so he's up he's at
the gym no I didn't even hear you do any
of that I know it's sad I hope he comes
back to worry sure to watch the
rebroadcast Thank You GV for being a TV
for being a consistent donor to the show
Kevin Ellsworth $10 thanks Kevin Chet
came through and provided Darth Vega
earth big some memes Thank You chat when
we saw moves
thank you Kevin Magnavox $5 this is a
song for my ad blocking I'm actually
using a GTX 480 and it's useless
nowadays so no point to the update I'm
that guy who sold all his GPUs well then
right now you should sell your 480
because this is yeah money oh yes indeed
retail most definitely thank you very
much Magnavox Captain Crunch for the $5
range since I sent Paul $5 I'm sending
you a pity $5 as well of course but as I
said before if you get the chance please
review the asus rog be 350f gaming if
you can thank you if it come if I come
in contact with that board I will
immediately arrest it and review it just
for you I'm wondering how much it costs
because the be 350 words probably
cheaper I feel like once the be 350
boards get past the hundred and thirty
hundred $40 range yeah might as well
skill makes more sense for the crew crew
suck of Mimer alright
Oh see Jedi Knight rock for the $5 limbo
channels first time watching its 110
dollars undoing sense not bad at all
actually
95 dollars after $15 man rebate card
right now that's a pretty good steal
that's a nice-looking board I love their
heat sinks yeah
see so such a sexy bow how they do a
design like that do one I wanted is this
the one medicine I haven't I have a
strict board that arrived I didn't ask
for it or anything it just arrived and
this might be it no maybe I'll take a
look at it I'll double-check when I get
home all right
Jedi Knight Rock $5.00 a little both
your channels first time watching a show
live watching a live show after watching
your videos decided to build a new
desktop that's awesome I always love
hearing hearing about stories when
people build their first desktop after
watching our videos yeah that's like cuz
I remember like how excited I was when I
first built mine so it's nice to be able
to pass that on to others that's cool
though
thanks Jedi Knight thanks Jed a fun
story Parker Neil from ten bucks Kyle
what research was done to determine the
use to determine to use the Quadro 4000
instead of something newer like the K
420 or kay 1200 the pairing of the CPU
to GPU seems unbalanced a better card is
the K 4200 or P 400 thanks so I based
that off of the pricing because this was
more or less a budget workstation system
which some people would argue against
because it was still around 1,000 bucks
or so but that I would say is still
budget oriented for a workstation system
because generally workstation GPUs can
be super expensive
we found the Quadro 4000 for $200
refurbished which I felt was a pretty
decent deal and and yeah I mean I didn't
really look at the other like like the K
1200 dean how much that goes for No
okay 1200 or the K 4200 I was looking at
Quadro cards in general and I saw like
obviously there was like the P 4000
which is significantly more expensive
than the one we got but overall when you
look at the required specs for the
application that my father-in-law
through the system was for it's running
which is Autodesk fusion 360 it's
actually a very lightweight program all
things considered it doesn't have the
same sort of requirements or demanding
needs that something like 3d SolidWorks
does for example it's
it's really not a super intensive
program so you know keeping our budget
in mind I felt like the the Quadro 4000
that we got was perfectly adequate the
Quadro K 1200 to us between 325 and $500
okay the Quadro k-420 costs 100 and 120
bucks and that very well may have been
120 not 200 the may have very well been
I'm not saying yeah I mean who's who's
to say really unless doing some aibee
aibee comparison testing but the
important part this is sort of a sort of
a mixed bag here my father-in-law called
me today to say that the application
like the software is running so much
more smoothly but it's crashing as soon
as they start rendering like even like a
small object which could be the fact
that it is a refurbished card which is
still under some sort of warranty but
yeah it's not a brand new card so I'm
trying to figure out like I guess every
time they try to render the the video
signal gets lost and the screen just
goes black so it could just be a bad
card that they need to exchange and or
it could be something else at play but I
was test I tested everything else on the
system it was working all the drivers
are installed and updated and whatnot so
something that we're still working out
right now but for the most part they
said that the system is like like the
program is just flying it's completely
flying compared to what they were using
before which was like an old pre-built I
don't know if it was like an HP
Pavillion or something but something
along those lines that they were still
using integrated graphics with that's
just huge the old jump yeah
and don't even get me started on why I
picked that over like a gaming card
because I've explained this too many
times to explain again now the right
JEDEC for $6.99 upgraded today FX 6300
to a risin 5 1600 Strix b250 motherboard
he must soon be 350 yes yes
good call tried NZ RGB 16 gigs my green
demon has heartbeat now now to fix
Windows Ultra said face hashtag ultra
don't know why you need to fix windows
and much later if you just upgraded you
should do a clean install please do a
clean install yeah trying to use your
old hard drive just wipe it not wear
that stuff up wipe it do a clean install
indeed yeah that's a fatty upgrade
though holy moly man the RGB memory is
so popular worse I don't know I say it's
gonna belt I felt like it was gonna be
more like a Venetia item or whatever
I've seen it everywhere budget I'm a
just like it systems budget systems to
people people are spending you can get
an RGB kit for pretty cheap like a
hundred fifty bucks like 16 gigs ddr4
not that much more I haven't I haven't
looked at it compared like I don't know
what the RGB premium is for those but
you have to pay but I guess they can't
get expensive if it's like 20 bucks and
I guess you know it's worth for people
yeah 20 30 bucks yeah I feel like memory
is like I feel like that should've been
one of the first RGB things though
because it's so visible in your system
yeah like where the side panel window
generally is it's just a right front and
center so it makes sense makes sense why
it's popular six dollars and sixty six
cents it's a very popular donation
amount what kind of vape is that ah the
vape in the background this this is a
hell's this called again so this is the
limit RDA limitless already a limitless
plus or something like that
and this is uh I forget what the box
mods called my goodness how am I
forgetting the box would sigelei that's
a sigelei 150 watts so it goes up to 150
watts the RDA is rebuildable so my own
coil is on there it's it's a simple to
post and I believe it's rockin just a
single uh what are we at 12 gauge 12 12
gauge Kanthal and I know there's a whole
there's a whole other world out there no
there's a whole other world beyond
computers that exists which
you know definitely definitely inferior
but um still very real but yeah thank
you for a squall gauge Kanthal is out
you just said yeah okay that's a gin
that sounds legit like oh yeah 16-gauge
alright good let's do the next one G B 0
9 - 2 9 $5 built my first PC watching
one of your in Paul's and Newegg videos
in 2018
well then I built three more for friends
and family love the show and things
that's awesome yeah these fun stories
love it especially videos yeah was the
original how to build a PC video or the
one the second one where Cal and I were
kinda lazy about it
I was probably saying when we were kinda
late cuz he said you're in Paul's new
make videos in 2015 I would imagine yeah
lazy one we did which the one that you
did like before I even started working
there was like super thorough detail
which I like the one that just was
awesome lazy was still okay it was still
just lazy
yeah yeah there's a lot of there's a lot
more we could have done to make them a
lot shorter and stuff true true and now
you can just watch our regular channels
for how to build the guides yep click
turn but 10 Canadian for your streaming
rig building a new rig that's the what 9
formula 7700 K 32 gigs of RAM 2 Strix
GTX 1010 atti OC with water blocks
building for gaming and overclocking
what PSU should I get HX 850 HX 1000 or
H X 1200
yeah 1000 to be safe you'd probably be
fine with the 850 to be honest with you
no you just it's it's nice to have
Headroom yeah and and the system like
that you probably also have you know
like more fans maybe a couple just you
know accessories that are also drawing
more power so it's nice to you know all
that stuff adds up it's nice to have a
little bit more Headroom and remember
you know like the efficiency ratings
right just cuz it's a 750 watt power
supply doesn't mean it's pumping out 750
all the time based on the railing and
stuff so uh yeah that sounds like a
pretty sweet system though Fred rant $5
waiting for the water on Kyle's head
yeah no not yet not yet three maybe she
should do it now should she do it now
that's gonna happen all right
get in here wait okay do I get to
connect what's that the floor can I put
it around my neck
why not no I will get entirely wet my
head it's important my head I don't see
any open like power outlets or anything
like that there's so much electricity
surging in this room this is the most
dangerous thing we've ever attempted I
feel like Criss Angel right now and now
I now know I get to be I get to be like
the the you know the modeling yeah
you're you're the man I'm waiting all
this you just get paid you just get
money to pay give him money get paid all
right hold on hold on hold on
put that put dragged the xsplit window
over in that corner so I can watch
myself get tanked up here yeah all right
do it
just all right just just just do it
Annie oh god here we go
she's really cool did you get that from
your fridge
you were the cook all right thank you oh
look at my pants and everything
I freaking better get a hundred dollars
from that or or at least it was good
content see
we can tell ya what well the show's
practically unfortunately Wow
alright let's wait for that hundred
dollar ilysm amazing finale yeah it
was hey let's just move the thumbnail
I'm okay I mean I have to pee so I feel
like that wouldn't that wouldn't be good
ah man I can't even touch my computer
now because my hands are all wet I know
that's a it's very thoughtful of her to
bring the towel in though hey I didn't
get splashed at all I suffered no ill
effects from that it was a very jelly it
was a very gentle boy it was a nice soft
you know but I felt every every bit of
it that much more and it looks like Fred
rant has delivered on his promise of a
hundred dollars donated Thank You Fred
Thank You Fred I can't wait to see what
you have in store for next week Friday
or in two weeks whenever wifey is
available to troll me super hard sodomy
sodomy
I hired a guy is gonna be there in like
five minutes just let him in and that'll
be the week he decides to not pay ass is
bleeding where's the hundred bucks this
is all a grand scheme it's all just
leading up to him just royally
me over he consistently chooses things
where if you didn't get paid yeah
absolutely
keeping it classy Fred thank you very
much thank you very much for actually
owning up to it

that's awesome actually Spidey is my
favorites I love from 15 year old fan
from India hey enjoy Spidey man's a
donation
enjoy enjoy the movie tweet a slim
snow-white they've rebooted spider-man
enough at might as well it's probably
gonna be good a thousand at times
eventually they'll do a good one and
this one looks
this one looks spirited yeah you know
you got Tony Stark yeah sure like the
spider-man costume is actually like a
fancier stuff like it doesn't seem like
his powers are all from being bit by the
spider the costume seems to be yeah yeah
what provides him with a lot of it as
well
yeah although there's must be a
combination I'm guessing probably good
good hybrid Leo gotta $10 I never said
this to a grown man but I think you need
more moose drool in you and I want to
help
ah Cheers well here's a I wish had more
moose drool yeah it's okay it's too far
away right now it's like down it's not
just downstairs but it's like they in
the garage
oh we have a second fridge in the garage
there all the beers at and it's like in
the back I don't know why next time
we'll just I'm just gonna get a mini
fridge bunch of traps he's gonna be a
mini fridge in here um but thank you
very much for that uh Gerard Gerald
gerald Baker ten dollars a few months
ago my white I agreed that I needed gtx
1066 a new bike to refresh my rig i
built in 2013 all while she was fully
aware that we are creating our first
level one human in december cheers -
awesome wives that's awesome dude yeah
Congrats Congrats the bun in the oven
and congrats on the gtx 1060 that's
equally exciting - creating life
procreation is right write it right up
there with you know bleeds new graphics
card hardware upgrades birth of the
miracle blood miracle of life like it's
like they're handed him it's like how do
you even choose yep like you can't just
have them come - they're made they're
made to live together and there really
are a picture of your newborn baby with
your gtx 1060 in his hands tweet-tweet
that can you guess the better decision
chunky - chief I need help magic 1080
run at 80 degrees at 80% no matter my
intake fans feet temps are the same at
40% and 100% intake fans B which is a IO
in pull not push but pull any advice for
our friendship you tie here Paul my
guess would be that there's something
wrong with your sensor or your readout
or your software or something like that
like all right so a 1080 it also depends
where you are if you're somewhere where
it's warm the 1080 is made to run it at
80 degrees that's its thermal cutoff and
when you play it will get warmer and
warmer and warmer and warmer and warmer
up until it hits 80 degrees and then
it'll start either ramping the fan up
until it equalizes or it might start
rolling back the the GPU frequency a
little bit so I would do that take a
look at something like MSI Afterburner
so you can keep a closer eye on it and
see and watch it as it goes if it's
hitting 80 and it's throttling back just
a little bit from the peak GPU frequency
that's normal
like isn't just expected behavior
especially if it's a founders edition
yeah if you're really cranking up your
fan speeds and the temperature is still
not going it down or something like that
then yeah you should maybe consider
something else but if your GPU fan
speeds at 40%
intake fan speed especially if you have
a radiator and it isn't gonna affected
that much mm-hmm so it seems like you're
in a relatively normal situation but if
you're cranking up with your fans and
the temperatures not going down at all
then you'd want to look at the software
using maybe get get a second opinion try
different monitoring software's and see
if they're all reporting the same thing
yeah that could be an option honestly if
it's a founders edition card then it
seems pretty normal if it's an Adam
board partner like some sort of custom
variant then either what Paul said maybe
look at other options or before you
might before you send it back if you're
ballsy enough and willing to take the
risk you could potentially try redoing
the Tim application oh yeah that might
help like for whatever reason maybe just
in the factory it just got a little
wonky and wasn't applied properly you
could try reapplying the thermal
interface material with your own stuff
it's it's pretty simple just keep
of the screws very little screw that you
removed from the PCB and whatnot and the
cooler and just just reapply thermal
paste there's YouTube tutorials on it
and stuff like that that might help who
knows it's worth a shot before you
return it if you're gonna work if you're
already set I'm returning it you might
as well give it a shot before sending it
back but good luck to you on that
whatever happens next up we've got who's
next Fred lost track
Fred hundred dollars hundred bucks is it
XD next week's next week's challenge
will work will require some prep on your
part each of you guys get to push a
cream pie into the others face for $200
$100 each
this sounds like cool not safe for work
this sounds like that one there's a
movie there's several movies where it's
like super rich guys like Fred's just
some super rich wealthy guy who just
doesn't know what to do with his money
so he just he just like dares people to
do crazy for his own sick amusement
which I have no problem Rick I've ever
gotten a pie in the face so I would be
I'd be down
it's like sounds like the most delicious
punishment ever yeah maybe that could be
a we could integrate that with face off
somehow okay I don't know I don't know I
hope we remember this we'll do our best
thank you so much Fred fine Thank You
Kyle for taking a glass of water in your
head to taste you're welcome
Chuck I flash $5 hey guys planning on an
x 99 no stops build with full custom
hard-line tubing and all that craziness
wish me luck with the loop no leaks good
luck man best of luck good luck mr.
flesh hope but I'll go smoothly for you
Robert Davis $5 Paul thank you for the
new egg video from long ago even though
it was like an hour and a half I need a
new case or I need a case I need a case
I saw the new half case recommendations
um I saw the new half I like the new
half I thought it looked pretty good it
looks sexy price they were talking about
was reasonable it might be like 130
hundred and forty bucks so if you had
your eyes on that then maybe something
you can hold out for it it should be out
soon I think it within the next month or
two that's actually gonna be available
beyond that it's I feel like it's hard
to make a case recommendation without a
little bit more guidance as far as what
you're into
because there's such a wide variety of
case styles and the other thing you know
you've got the minimalist look like
fractal goes for it's pretty basic
standard like a box yeah straight lines
and everything and then you got the
stuff that's a little bit more stylized
you know with the plastic facades that
go on the front that might have
different shapes and and styles and
designs and stuff right um
it depends on if you want view air
cooling or just liquid cooling how much
radio support you want you know what
form factor motherboard you're trying to
get how you want your cable management
to look and feel if you want your power
supply to be visible or not if you want
LEDs or not there's so many variables
really if you're if you're building
something new keep an eye out for a
motherboard that has the USB 3.1 header
on it the new the new version and then a
case that has that as well because I
think that's one of the more useful
features of the case that you can they
can get right now wait what did you say
I totally missed that a USB 3.1 header
oh yes on the motherboard yeah and then
there's cases I think I know BitFenix
and then those are the case
manufacturers as well that are starting
to integrate that as well so keep an eye
out for that but yeah if you were if
you're into the half if you like a look
at that that I'd say that's worth
hanging out hanging out for another man
like those biggest fans at the front of
it yes where are those big fan hundred
millimeter I'd like to see those come
back in style cuz that was it always
I've always been a big fan of big fans
yeah yeah it works so perfectly it's
good
mr. Senor Senor ten bucks after watching
your videos I've decided to finally
upgrade my 295x2 z-- does that mean yes
Wow does that mean you have to 295x2 one
man is that a quad fire set up to 1080i
SLI please do a review in the Asian
voice a review of what Oh any review of
that decision just do I think you all
made a good choice from my going from
the 295x2 to the 1080p is Arang the
issue is that they're very good I mean
you get to crossfire you but the
crossfire the a to the
scaring the steering is
pick a prayer compared to the SRA Nvidia
you you take one good hard look at the
Jensens rather jacket you tell me that
does not come from the innovation and
shield you got Lisa Suez also I've done
I'm just sorry I'm scaring I don't know
I'm very consistent with my elves and
our pronunciation some very consistent
beautiful alright SM Forster with five
bucks Canadian and building a new are
seven seventeen hundred gaming and
content build not sure about power
supply wattage 750 watt EVGA g3
motherboards and x3 some of the Ezra
killer SLI AC of course there are four
sixty X cables you're totally fine with
750 watt yeah yeah the only way you'd be
a little bit concerned even a little bit
would be if you go with an SLI
configuration which it doesn't seem like
you're planning and doing it doesn't
seem yeah but a 750 watt even with most
SLI configurations right now would still
be fine as long as you're not doing like
Titan X peas or like to 250 ish Watts
cards yes I was hearing that hundred and
80 watt ish and below range which any of
the new AMD cards 575 80 is fine with
right as well as a 1080 or below on the
Nvidia said less you can some Vega yep I
hear that yeah there you go you might
want to reconsider but again even when
even if they get a single big aid single
you still should be this final all right
couple more more rolling in as well
Jonathan Warmington 10 bucks
hey guys but my first computer in oh my
first computer in seven years to 6800 K
at 4.2 gigahertz and EVGA 1080 hybrid an
army 50 X par spot if I get another 1080
with the PS you need upgrading also
would water cooling be quieter than the
a iOS you should be fine on the power
supply should be find the parts like we
just said 1080 is only a hundred and 80
watt card and we should be good even
with
ah water cooling honestly it's probably
gonna be negligible dude he's got the
1080 hybrid so I would say it's hard to
say cuz with water cooling a lot of
times the pump can be the noisy thing
yeah and the 1080 hybrid from EVGA I'm
not sure how much nice that pump makes
but when you're adding another one
you're gonna add another pump so it's
possible so those might make some more
commotion but I mean it's I mean I don't
know yeah I guess if you're idling the
pump noise would be it's hard to saying
it was it is hard to say but I mean
you're going water cooling anyway maybe
instead of getting another 10 a dihybrid
just get another 10 80 with the with the
standard layout PC because I believe the
1080 hybrid from EVGA uses a standard
reference design PCB and then water cool
it and then that could be fun yep yeah D
grow enough 44:11 with $5 a I don't know
what the a is it's okay five bucks Paul
are you getting more hoodies for your
store is it Australian Mickey it could
be uh are my hoodie's out I'm planning
to get more hoodies if mine are sold out
yeah oh wait that is directed to you
though so I guess maybe I have a few
more cats I keep forgetting my hair's
wet like what the hell's that what is
your feeling on my head are my head you
sold out sighs out of stock out of stock
out of stock
wow you're right my hoodies are pretty
much all salt so that I got 2x if you
want a to X or a 3x or not but I'm out
of 4x all you can get is 2x and 3x
yes I'll restock the hoodies maybe not
right now because it's summer but soon
well I guess if you're Australian then
maybe you want it now because it's it's
winter they mana but that's confusing
but yeah I will restock the hoodies that
is that is in the plane okay
that's next uh all right we're gonna
have to cut off donations from here on
out we're getting too many of them so
sell don't add any more to the Google
Doc people don't donate any more
if you do we will not be reading your
messages because we're we're a little
short on time here after Mac true Mac
true gets in because he probably did it
right now but that's the last one cut it
off after Mac true so last one all right
what do we got another five dollars she
says yep thanks to the mining boom I was
able to sell them at $900 each one free
upgrade what card love the content Wow
it's a 480 really do you know I think
you must talk about for a name for our
export 84 900 bucks
crazy good lord well I have some rich
mofo who doesn't know damn thing about
GPS so I should sell me look hoodies a
floor idea for $900 all MOBOT to my
remaining oh no he said he's an
upgrading from his 295x2 the 295x2 s
were nine hundred each all right no no
no that's perfect
Styx five dollars trigger flash is my
good buddy but can you tell him to let
me build his computer because I designed
it please thanks guys I love you take
your flash let's Styx build your
computer because Laura gave us why not
build it together if your friends hey
that's not yeah that's that's totally
acceptable socially accepted that way if
you know how and you designed it you can
get the joy of building and if he's less
familiar then yeah two guys two guys can
build the computer together in the same
room yeah without any sort of generator
it's a bonding experience bonding you'd
be closer Bonnie yes try try this try
like both of you screwing in one screw
at the same time like one like both one
hand over the other same screwdriver two
guys one screwdriver try that it'll
change your relationship might not be
the most efficient next up we've got X
DNR X $5 want to build shift X PC case
when available as a gaming home theater
PC
budget 1000 to 700 ish that's a wide
budget well y'all could y'all build one
when it comes out shift X PC case I've
heard that name
was it look like antics oh ship decks
yes yeah of course yeah I think we both
did videos on it just yeah yeah month
ago right my thumbnail I was very proud
of my thumbnail for that one
oh yeah fully erect yes indeed it's the
vertical sort of HTPC looking thing that
you can also put horizontally um
yep I'm hoping to do a building one when
it comes out I don't know I'm waiting on
fantex to just hit me up be like hey we
got this curse no are you ready yeah
it's up to them it's fun it's fun though
cool-looking case does look cool as well
will I've got a good judge it based on
when it comes out and you know when the
email comes in and what's what's on the
schedule and everything but I wouldn't I
wouldn't mind doing a buildin and the
ship decks for sure
yep and then finally we've got mech man
guru 41 $10 I wasn't too keen on Paul's
bashing of UCLA last week blue and
golden an awesome color combo much
better than his catchment mustard school
colors USC can suck it go Bruins
Wow so you catch a good mustard yeah how
was ki mustard even lit in a positive
okay like you possibly confuse mmm
terrible gaudy colors of ketchup and
mustard with the USC colors which are
cardinal and gold cardinal and gold I
mean see I guess and then they must not
teach that you know discretion of
distinguishing between different colors
at UCL that's alright it's okay it's a
sustained our stay down school he failed
colors 101 colors 101 see the professors
at UCLA know they suck
with colors thank you why are you
bashing a new skillet cuz I get cuz I
have no halation with either one I'm
glad since you're my co-host and you
have anything over and since your
allegiance is allegiances to USC I I am
USC I'm Pro USC - yeah also Mike Mike
