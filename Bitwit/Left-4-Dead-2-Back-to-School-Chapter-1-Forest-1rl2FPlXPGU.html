and I am playing left 4 dead 2 today
hope you guys had a happy Halloween by
the way I hope it was safe and fun ate a
lot of candy and stuff I had a cool
Halloween I was basically just playing
this game walk and more specifically I
was playing a new back-to-school
campaign it's completely handmade and
that's what I'm playing right now just
want to show you guys interested and
it's it's six chapters long and this is
the first chapter we've just begun come
our journey and I wanna bore you a lot
of teaching leave a questions at the
actual school found in chapter 6 and I
actually got all the way to chapter 6
previously and I can tell you right now
it's a very fun campaign it's pretty
lengthy - it took the dude or however
many people were working on this
campaign took them three years to
develop so and it definitely pays off
everything looks really great well
thought-out
and oh yeah thought I'd just take you
guys along for the ride so sit back
relax and enjoy the zombie murder I hate
the shotgun by the way
probably because I suck at it shortly
okay
don't like fire
let's change
dude
doesn't this totally remind you of the
farm from Walking Dead totally right
getting sad the farm now more like get
off the farm they were on the farm for
like way too long in that series finally
they're out there in the prison now
pretty badass big fan of the show now I
get to live the show very very effective
way to open door so this is just the
first chapter I plan on doing videos of
all the other chapters all six of them
and I will try to get them all uploaded
around the same time whether it is with
the same group of people that I'm
playing with currently and I'm not sure
be cool if I could just do it all in one
run but no promises oh boy
damnit drag wolf why'd you have to lurk
afford to be you down here yeah pay for
what you've done
Oh God
oh no of course I had to be put right
next to this guy mother God Drive walk
this is all your fault I hope you know
like you very very little
when we totally messed this room up
didn't we wouldn't want to live here you
guys done you done now you know I still
hear the screams
is my spot get out of here Francis seat
jacker
and I met a vamo love it
okay I don't want that really don't want
it that way
you have to tell us every time you're
reloading okay I know you're probably
reloading a lot you don't need to say it
every five seconds we get the hell out
of here now please
I don't like it here this is obviously
not a good location get off the farm for
what let's go there but there are five
of us normally five thought it was only
for a I'm thinking over the first lucky
day well more than merry thank you
planning a hunter Oh God smoke our
smokings bad kids don't smoke in crime
it's bad shooting do it
don't shoot me yeah just shoot me in the
butt
Thanks drag well you are you are a total
drag no wonder your name's that oh okay
that's also a drag anyone could help me
thank you
load run so fast like 28 days later
zombies the worst kind I think 20 days
later is probably like my favorite
zombie movies of all times probably cuz
they're not really zombies they're just
infected I think that makes the scarier
it's a little bit more believable like
something like that could actually
happen and just the thought of you know
what if is just kind of terrifying
I don't know what's your guys favorite
zombie movie cuz I'm actually a huge fan
of zombie movies the original done of
the Dead is also excellent I'm not just
saying that cuz the original but it is
also awesome because it is the original
but uh I don't know they still managed
to make it terrifying even though the
zombies walk like freakin two miles an
hour or extremely slow but it's still
like this expense just kills me every
time
river water is contaminated I think
everything is contaminated over here I
don't think it's just limited to the
river water to be honest oh boy
Maalik my using thinking malt I'm sure
why not
yeah I definitely rather ever gonna do
I'm right there with you bill maybe some
Boomer bile bills mmm maybe later
I hate these dudes I thought they were
astronauts at first I was like well
let's wire astronauts in the middle of
the forest doesn't make any sense and
they realize they're like swamp and
radiation dudes we're not so fortunate
radiation was the least of their worries
apparently and these guys do sure climb
for being like undead and totally
brainless they sure are good at parkour
aren't they I can't even do that
only when you learn how to die I see you
next
take an axe over a pistol any day just
because they're fun something okay I'm
glad you've got
they're coming up the hill
Wow look at them all go all in like a
single okay I could probably use that
pistol laughs no you know what that's
good on the axes fools my buddies don't
kill them all first that's my least
favorite stuff right there the noxious
acid gets me every time
oh hello oh he's still up
goddamn you yeah you're dead now you're
all good yeah yeah oh
hey guys use the door so uncivilized
oh man you're getting slaughtered by
these guys as I'm getting dragged get
off on a heel Francis what myself
oh I'm hoping karma comes back to save
me later you better take me to miss
Francis look out rust puppet why is she
standing like a freakin china doll just
super straight look at her posture how
can you have posture while shooting a
gun like that pretty impressive
reloading couple me for sick I got a
heal --heel damn you heal

dangerously close to dying I don't
