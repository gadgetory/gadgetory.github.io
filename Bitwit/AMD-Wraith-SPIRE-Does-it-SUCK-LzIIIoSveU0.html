channel today we're going to be taking a
closer look at AMD's one of AMD's brand
new stock coolers that comes bundled
with the r7 1700 and that is the race
aspire and this is not to be confused
with the race the original race that AMD
launched a year or two ago nor is it to
be confused with the race max which is
the other new stock cooler from AMD that
comes bundled with the 1800 X and the
1700 X now it's perfectly reasonable for
you to be wondering why am i doing a
standalone video on a stock cooler that
seems more or less uninteresting and it
might be for some of you but the way I
see it is that the r7 1700 is probably
the most appealing of the three Rison
chips right now of the r7 family due to
its lower price point at 330 MSRP and
the fact that you can overclock the crap
out of it and pretty much get similar
performance on par with the 1800 X for a
fraction of the cost so with that in
mind users looking to buy the 1700 are
also probably checking out the included
spire cooler thinking well is that
cooler really good enough or is it cool
enough or quiet enough or should I just
throw in the towel right now and assume
that I'm gonna have to buy a 30 40 $50
cooler anyway so that's what we're
really going to answer today now with
that said let's dive into some of the
basic specs of the race spire starting
with its TVP of 95 watts which is
actually fairly nice because we only
have a 65 watt TDP on the horizon CPU
the 1700 is a fairly low power chip so
the fact that AMD has bundled a 95 watt
TDP cooler with it means that they've
actually kept overclocking in
overclockers in mind with this
particular launch so that's actually
really nice we're going to have
additional Headroom to take the chip a
bit further you may have also noticed
that the spire is significantly smaller
than both the race and race max and
that's actually a really good thing
because the one complaints is a big
complaint that I had with the original
Maxx the original race cooler was that
it was so freakishly large that it was
intruding on the RAM clearance and
actually you couldn't even install the
leftmost dim properly unless you had
like a like a full ATX board because
with a with a small form-factor board
you just had all that component tree
being squeezed together on the PCB and
with creating all these sort of
clearance issues between the cooler
itself and the memory you're not getting
that at all with the spire regardless of
what form factor motherboard
you're dealing with so I think that's a
huge plus overall the other thing I want
to mention is that the fan itself on the
spire is 92 millimeters it's actually
fairly large for a stock cooler these
days very much modeling after the race
in that sense but it's also fairly quiet
as we will see a bit later and that is
being controlled by a 4-pin pwm fan
header which is also nice to see the
spire also comes included with a second
cable it's got a four pin connector that
plugs directly into the RGB header on
your motherboard should you have one and
that's just to control the RGB ring that
goes around the fan we're not going to
be diving into any customization or or
demoing that at all this is more so
about the performance again but if you
were to control or configure that the
LED you would have to go into the
appropriate motherboard manufacturers
software so if you had a crosshair Asus
board you'd have to use Ora if you were
on MSI motherboard like I am would be
the MSI gaming app and so forth but
pretty cool to see some a little bit of
bling factor on a stock cooler for once
that is pretty sweet however of course
you don't have to enable that you can
just not use the cable don't plug that
in and all of a sudden it's it's
completely unlimited so the last day to
discuss here is mounting and the spire
actually mounts to the motherboard very
easily it probably takes 10 to 15
seconds to do and at first it looks like
it does it the same way as the Intel
stock coolers with pushpins it's
actually not the case these are in fact
ridges regular Phillips head screws that
screw directly into a name for backplate
that goes behind the PCB of course of
the motherboard and installation is just
a breeze super simple straightforward
and it works properly it's less awkward
than the pushpins on the intel side and
it's much less awkward than the stupid
seesaw bar the seesaw retention bar that
we that we find on older A&amp;amp;B and also
the the race coolers as well and I think
now we can talk about some of the
testing so testing hardware first off
rocking an MSI x3 70 X power gaming
titanium motherboard that is just way
too long for for a name we've also got a
gtx 1070 that's rockin a Founders
Edition stock frequencies to 16 gigs of
Corsair Vengeance lpx ddr4 of course
which is one of the few ddr4 kits that's
validated for Rison and then we've also
got a left of 1600 watt power supply a
512 gig SX 900 SSD from a data which
we're using as a fresh clean install
boot dry
it's a really fresh drive there's really
not much else on other than the
essentials and of course the right spire
and all that jazz so that's pretty much
going to do it for our testing setup we
are rockin Windows 10 54 bit of course
with the latest in video drivers three
seven eight dot six six
oh all right and testing so I fired up
the test bed for the first time
everything running stock the Wraiths
cooler is that stock whatever default
curve that it runs at and the 1700 is
running at stock frequencies which in
precision boosts up to three point two
gigahertz
on all cores under multi-threaded
workload so that's what we were rockin
there so for this initial test we fired
up GTA 5 at max settings 2560 by 1440 2x
msaa
and what we found after about twenty
minutes of gameplay was that the CPU
temperatures were staying in the low 60s
and that's in degrees Celsius of course
which is fairly reasonable granted we
aren't putting a huge thermal burden on
the CPU just yet because we haven't
overclocked it at all but I mean the fan
is just running on auto we haven't maxed
out the fan speed on this fire by any
means and I guess I was just expecting a
little bit worse in terms of thermal
performance than what we're seeing here
I mean it's not super chilly in my room
or anything
ambient temps aren't they could always
be lower but actually a fairly good
start for the race spire but now let's
see how it performs when we crank things
up on the multiplier I got the chips
table at 3.9 gigahertz at 1.3 volts of
course CPUs II was reading it a little
bit higher at one point three one two
but overall very very consistent on the
V core and then I fired up GTA 5 once
again all the same settings and saw the
core temps start to spike up I mean they
just started climbing the ladder once
they hit about eighty degrees Celsius I
rebooted into the BIOS and I just
cranked the race fan of the the spire
fan up to a higher percent and before
you start judging and start thinking
well it's probably going to sound like a
turbine mention at this point it
actually doesn't the spire fan is
incredibly quiet even at 100 percent fan
speed I was remarkably impressed by how
quiet it was I actually had my again my
AC my window AC unit running at the time
when I cranked the fan to 100 and I
literally had to put my ear to the
cooler to make sure that it was actually
taking effect because it was just being
drowned out by the window AC unit which
isn't really that loud to begin with so
especially if you're gonna be using
headphones while you're gaming you're
really
not going to notice the race spending up
to 100% at all especially inside of a
conventional clothes chassis and on that
note before we can get off to a sound
test you can actually hear 100% fan
speed sounds like I did want to mention
that you're also the microphone is also
going to be picking up the fan noise
coming from the GPU and the power supply
as well so just bear that in mind as you
go about listening
so with our r7 overclocks 23.9 gigahertz
table and our race fire cooler now
operating at a hundred percent fan speed
I jump once again into gta5 just to see
how much lower the temperatures on our
CPU would be and what we found was with
just GTA 5 no background applications
just the game alone we were seeing
temperatures now in the high 40s that's
actually really good especially running
overclocked and all that when you
consider everything I will say that
idling temperatures are are oddly high
we were seeing like high 30s and low 40s
just at idle and so the fact that we're
really good raising like seven to ten
degrees
jumping into a game is kind of
interesting I'm not exactly sure if
idling temps are high or if the
overclocking temps are low it's just
just kind of strange but that that is
only does only like that only answer is
part of the question because the r7 1700
is really appealing to gamers who want
more than just gaming who are actually
doing multi-threaded applications like
live encoding if you're going to be
gaming while streaming maybe editing
your videos at the same time so I
decided to retest with GTA 5 still
running but this time streaming it out
to 720p at 60 frames per second as well
as having a couple chrome tabs open as
well just to see exactly how much the
temperatures spiked up and sure enough
we did see it increase going from the
high 40s again to the 50s and 60s now so
I was monitoring these temperatures
within AMD rise and master by the way so
I don't know I still don't know it's
still too early to tell just how
reliable that application is for
monitoring temps but it's really all I
had on hand at the moment so just bear
that in mind going into these numbers so
getting to the 50s and 60s I mean that's
still very reasonable considering that
we're almost overclocked to four
gigahertz here now I did try to
overclock to four gigahertz however the
voltage required to hit that at least on
my particular chip which was one point
three six to five that's actually what I
got away with when I was using using
that not too a cooler in the other video
that voltage was introducing too much
heat for the spire to really handle and
so what we saw was a little bit of
thermal throttling once we got up to
like the high 70s and then all of a
sudden it just Auto failsafe and shut
down I mean it just
crashed from instability or from getting
too hot to prevent any sort of damage
from happening and that was kind of a
bummer so we didn't quite we're not
quite able to hit that four gigahertz
mark with the spire at least with my
chip you guys might be might fare better
in the Silicon Lottery and whatnot and
be able to hit four gigahertz no problem
with this cooler but at least in my
testing setup today I was unable to do
so so that sort of leads me into how I
feel about the spire overall we can kind
of wrap this video up is that if you
aren't trying to hit the utmost highest
overclock with your r7 1700 then the
spire is a perfectly sound solution that
is incredibly quiet for what it is and
actually offers some really decent
thermals especially on you know is it is
a 65 watt TDP chip with a 95 watt TDP
cooler so you do have that additional
Headroom if you did want to overclock
you just might not be able to squeeze
every last ounce of performance out of
your CPU as you might with say a
higher-end aftermarket air cooler like a
tower cooler for example or of course a
liquid cooled option but overall a very
solid value add from AMD that I think is
going to save a lot of users a nice
chunk of change on an aftermarket cooler
the last thing I want to mention is that
the spire is a downward firing cooler so
you're going to be exhausting hot air at
completely different directions all over
inside your case but as long as you have
the proper airflow path that's going
through your chassis and you've got some
nice intake fans maybe a couple exhaust
the top and the rear then that should
pretty much redirect and refocus that
exhausted air from the cooler out the
appropriate exits of your chassis so
that's pretty much all I have for you
guys today let me know what you think
about the spire so far in the comments
and also feel free to toss me a like on
this video if you enjoyed it have a good
one guys I hope you all have a lovely
weekend or whenever or a weekday
