the link in the description below for
more info what's up guys welcome back to
the channel hope you're all doing well
today we're assembling yet another
gaming pc big surprise this is for
December's PC of the month and I've
decided on a high end
AMD risin gaming system with a black and
white theme and I'm not gonna go too
crazy I'm sort of creatively tapped out
this week because we just got done with
the end through elite build if you
haven't seen that check that out it's
pretty crazy but this is gonna be more a
more straightforward build very simple
but still a very capable gaming system
even though it's not $10,000 like the
the elite build it'll be great the fact
that we're using horizon 7 1700 with
eight cores 16 threads and lots of
overclocking Headroom also indicates
that this could potentially be used as a
pretty decent workstation PC thanks to
the versatility of these high-end Rison
cores we've also got a be 350 tomahawk
Arctic motherboard from MSI a nice
little sort of mid-range to entry-level
a m4 motherboard it's also got a very
unique sort of white / silvery aesthetic
which i think is gonna match really
nicely with everything else we got here
pairing that with a 16 gigabyte kit of
Ripjaws v ddr4 at 3000 megahertz really
important that you get a relatively fast
ddr4 kit if you're gonna be pairing it
with a Rison CPU because of the whole
the whole infinity fabric integration
with the Zen architecture that actually
helps out a lot when it comes to raw
gaming performance additionally we've
got a nice cooler for our CPU this is
the h5 from cryo rig I've only really
ever dealt with like the the more
entry-level cryocoolers like the the h7
I don't think I've ever dealt with and
then the the low-profile one the c7 both
have been fantastic very excited to be
using this one for the first time ever
it has a nice white cover plate a pretty
beefy heatsink compared to the other two
I just mentioned and sort of a slim
profile fan it looks very nice so super
stoked about that the gtx 1070 TI from
gigabyte is supposed to be a pretty
decent card it's one of the more
aggressively priced 1070 TI's on the
market right now and it still has a
triple fan design of windforce cooler
with RGB lighting a metal backplate and
all that jazz it does have some orange
orange accents on the shroud on the
bottom of the shroud but once we get it
installed you probably won't see too
much of that so I'll be able to sleep at
night we've also got an a 55 this is
just a regular say the six gigabit per
second SSD from a silicon power or SP
they don't even put silicon power on the
packaging anymore it just says SP you
have to go to the back of the box now or
the back of the packaging for it to
actually say silicon power I don't know
if that's they're going under a identity
crisis I would know all about that
though we've got a 2 terabytes WD black
hard drive just to set a simple low
mechanical for all of our games and
whatnot and then we've got a power
supply from in wind this is the C 750
watt as part of their classic series
it's an 80 plus Platinum certified unit
it's very heavy which usually means
usually means that it's high quality and
it has fully modular cables and all that
supposed to have a pretty quiet fan as
well this is not a very stable set up
for my Ram stand here tape measures
don't make good Ram stands who knew
now the power supply does come with all
black cables which is nice but to spice
things up I decided to go with some
custom sleeved cables from woz mods
there aren't a ton of really high
quality slavers out there in the PC DIY
market so whenever I come across one I'm
sure to call them out and and give them
a shot these are beautifully sleeved
Thank You woz mods for taking the time
and getting these to me really quick
shipping was super fast the rates on the
site are very affordable guys check it
out I'll put a link in the description
below if you want to give your your rig
a little extra something aesthetically
and then finally I think yeah last but
not least we have our case here again
from in wind thank you and win for
hooking this up this is the in win three
oh stop it stop moving you're killing my
vibe this is the in win 303 see the see
indicating that it has a USB 3.1 gen2
type-c port on the front panel which is
great
it also has RGB lighting a beautiful
tempered-glass side panel that has two
less removal I also got a couple fractal
design silent series r2 case fans that
we might be populating this case with
just to give us a little bit more
airflow they of course have the
traditional fractal design white blades
and black frames which i think is also
going to look pretty nice so that ladies
and gentlemen is what we're working with
today should be a very fun and as I
mentioned straightforward build so let's
just dive right in and get things
assembled and we'll circle back after
it's all done talk about
what building was like inside of the in
wind 303 see as a quick disclaimer good
quick disclaimer I've actually never
built inside of an in wind 303 303 C or
even a 301 so this is gonna be a very
fresh experience for me that I'll be
happy to share with you guys as soon as
we're all assembled so on that note
ladies and gentleman let's go ahead and
get built in three two one
let's build it
well guys I've done it again you know
that thing I do when I'm dumb and I do
something stupid because I'm an idiot
yeah as I'm sure a lot of you guys
already caught from the beginning of the
video this motherboard does not have a
USB 3.1 type C header on it which means
the number one feature of this case
cannot be utilized which is the front
panel USB 3.1 type C port
Joran I'm sorry I was reading I was
ordering the parts very quickly and this
sounds like an excuse because it totally
is and I saw that it did support USB 3.1
type C but I didn't notice it was Gen 1
and it was actually talking about the
rear i/o port that it has not the
internal header so in a frenzy of
ordering parts
I bought a motherboard that does not
support the thing that we need so um
yeah ha ha ha well I guess there's not
much we can do now
other than press onward with the build I
mean I don't even have an alternate be
350 board that would match the theme
here that also has a 3.1 type-c header
so use this as a reminder to never
listen to anything I say although you
guys probably do that anyway so you're
smart unlike me ok I'm with the belt
let's hope nothing else goes wrong good
all right so the build is complete
it looks very matchy-matchy and
everything went smoothly for the most
part and as you guys kind of watch back
some of this b-roll here you might
notice that the system is powered off
for every shot and the reason that is is
because the ATX cable that came included
with this in wind power supply was
actually incorrect or defective I'm not
sure which one but basically one end of
it one end of the cable terminates to a
normal 24 pin that goes to the
motherboard the other end is a 16 plus
14 pin terminates into two different
connectors that would go into the unit
but that's that's a 30 pin a 30 total of
30 pins and the unit itself only accepts
24 pin so basically what that equates to
is I can't power the motherboard meaning
I can't boot the system so I am super
strapped for time I would have loved to
unplug everything undo what little cable
management I did do and swap in a
different power supply so I could show
it to you guys powered on but I just
don't have the time or bandwidth to do
that in this video so I'm gonna have to
promise you guys I owe you that we'll do
some sexy b-roll in a part to follow up
or something like that but other things
that I can comment on include the cable
management in general is is interesting
I mean it's it's not amazing and it's
not awful there are certain things that
you would expect to see on a modern 2017
case like tie-down points behind the
motherboard tray there are none or very
few from what I could tell so my cables
are kind of just sticking out
fortunately the way the back
side panel works is very is very good at
just being able to use brute force to
clamp it shut and I didn't really have
any trouble with that but it would have
been nice to just you know if you're a
neat freak or you have OCD to just be
able to tie those cables down
additionally the front panel connectors
at the very bottom usually are plugging
in at the very bottom of your
motherboard we're a little more
difficult than usual just because the
way that this is designed you don't
really have any space beneath the
motherboard for your hands to go so it's
like literally just the bottom of your
motherboard is the bottom of the case
and so it took me a little bit more
effort in time to actually get those
plugged in and of course there's order
of operations there because you actually
have to plug in the front panel
connectors first before you install any
of the intake fans I should have
mentioned this earlier but the way this
case is designed is that it gets all of
its intake from the bottom of the case
there's a nice pullout dust filter which
I didn't show you guys earlier you can
install up to three 120s and that gives
you all the necessary intake that you
might need pull an air from the bottom
of the case there is no ventilation no
fan mounts at the front of the case at
all so it's pretty unique in that sense
and then obviously you have some room
here for äô radiators and things like
that I just have a single exhaust fan
here and then I installed one at the
back so overall in total I'm using five
I installed five of those fractal design
silent series fans looks like they're
gonna do a fine job I guess we can test
it out in a later video and the other
thing is that I overestimated or
underestimated how insanely thin or slim
or narrow this case is especially when
installing a cooler like this like the
h5 here from cryo rig it barely it
barely made it to width via the side
panel actually that the heatsink itself
and this cover plate was fine but the
fan was actually touching resting up
against the tempered glass so any taller
and we might have had even more issues
than we've already had with this bills a
day getting the motherboard installed
was pretty straightforward there were a
couple pre-installed standoffs but I did
still have to install a few more of them
for a regular ATX board the drive
mounting system seems pretty
straightforward there's a couple
mounting trays actually on this side
right here they're for
1/2 inch drives and 2 more behind the
motherboard tray that can that can has
either three and a half or two and a
half inch drive so that's where they are
just get them out of the way keep it a
little bit more stealthy love how the
cables turned out love how they look in
the final build go ahead and check waz
mods out in the comments or in the
description below if you're at all
interested and yeah overall this was a
fun system to build even though we ran
into several complications this time
around but that's just how it goes
sometimes guys you just gotta roll with
the punches so hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video if you did toss me a
like on it it really helps me a lot and
if you are interested in what you give
me my videos a week early without ads
you can check me out on floatplane I'll
leave a link in the description for that
as well but until next time guys have a
good one and I will see y'all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
