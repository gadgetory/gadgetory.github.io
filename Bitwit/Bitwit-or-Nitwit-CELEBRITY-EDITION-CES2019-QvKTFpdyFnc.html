alright guys
event winner nitwit CES celebrity
edition we're gonna have three guests on
today's show it's gonna be awesome five
questions you get one lifeline that's
how it works except we have very very
important people now Paul you guys know
Paul I guess it's man requires no
introduction and what are their hapless
victims or am i up against today you've
also got Steve and gamers Nexus you guys
know Steve how's it going man
well I'm sleep deprived than starving so
I suspect I will do very well that's
exactly why I save this for the very end
of the week he'll give you a good run
for free money he's fairly knowledgeable
when it comes to computers he does he
does know some things but I have made
sure so to make the questions extra of
tricky okay we'll see and then we've
also got Luca you guys know Lou he's LMG
floatplane he makes the gears turn
behind the scenes a lot of time there's
also one camera a lot of time to haggle
amiss I'm good but like shattered with
fear right now how many how many bricks
per minute are you shooting at a lot you
completely honest I am more nervous for
this than like any speaking engagement
I've had noir he's also a smart cookie
so I hear he's earned a prestigious
award here at this event as well key
online influencer of the year or
something like that he must be under I
should also mention that this whole CES
celebrity edition of bitter no it was
your idea not to admit it right to be
really funny to get horribly right now
yeah you're known Korea I'm looking
forward to the Royals
so I'm glad we agreed to that kena we
can agree to that right now so we're
just gonna get started fall the way the
Lifeline works you can ask it on any
question that you get stumped on it
allows you to choose two answers instead
of one and as long as one of those
answers is correct you move on to the
next question are you nervous at all now
because I know I'm gonna lose you've
already admitted defeat yes that's a
good weight going into it you have the
list of questions you're any other
question number one we'll just dive
right in here no pressure what family of
Intel processors saw the introduction of
PCI Express 3.0 is it a Sandy Bridge
beam
Ivy Bridge see London Bridge two three
four date as well what he said London
Bridge I did say London Bridge bridge
that was not that was not I'm gonna
reserve my right for non final answer
okay sure whatever do we do the other
questions if I get this one wrong yes
for fun so forget some giggles okay so I
can't get out of it by choosing London
Bridge no you cannot you've just said
you've just admitted that one of the
answers is incorrect you really showed
me oh my god I really don't want to be
knocked out immediately don't be ashamed
to use your life line at any point even
if it's early on as well as 4000 series
I've ever just 3000 series let's see I'm
between sandy and I mean right now
okay it's been a while yeah I even wanna
know 2012 Sandy Bridge was 2011 I think
yeah PCI siga ratified pcie 3.0 I'm like
- I can cut on these questions in that
guys I'm really good at the lifeline
alright let's do it
ARB but I think any five-year bridge I
will say bi me rich the Ivy Bridge is
great okay okay okay okay take a breath
man you're doing great that is
absolutely correct there's there's this
is an entry off to a great start
hey that did some work with ivy bridge
yep yeah and I still remember yeah
that's good is it always the case but
having a good memory really helps in
this show that's correct the correct
answer was Ivy Bridge okay and actually
I'm about to choose sandy so that's back
there was two on Ivy Bridge as well it
wasn't there yes yeah Sagar bridge was
like the Hut yeah all right it was the
birthday wasn't reducted on any like at
least one off there was a few boards
yeah that's right yeah you know more
than you think you do I'm just I'm just
spooked man it's been a while I've been
out of games a little bit all right
let's have a fair with number two you're
still in the game though I'm still in
the Gary call about how many pixels
would you have if you connected three 8k
displays to narky x20 atti well I love
how there's the inclusion of the
graphics card like cuz they're just fun
for you guys alright
is it a 75 million pixels be a hundred
million pixels C 180 million pixels or D
240 million pixels
or deed no you can't calculate that why
not wait what you know do you mind what
are you doing this instantly just
qualifies you okay I'll keep them
okay now question here yeah which
definition make hey are we going with so
we were doing like quad porque
essentially okay can I use a calculator
on my phone you cannot use a calculator
huh you use the calculator in your brain
try to remember how many pixels porque
has I'm really bad at math in my brain
oh god I'm so screwed we have an upset
yeah you say that I can do this I'm
saying it now that's still ain't what
it's so unlike you to just break the
rules and not give a shit so out of
character but I see you probably have an
answer now
I actually stopped because you were
complaining so much so it's not exactly
a case are these what's the resolution
of the display so we're gonna go like
this
Oh 69 so 4 by quad 4 queso 3840 by 2160
4k
and then we said that one was we said
that was 8 million I'm gonna go with 3
huh yeah okay hold on hold on hold on
sugar
I'm gonna lifeline okay because I'm not
gonna trust my mental math like on the
floor while I'm really nervous
exactly so yeah I'm gonna live tail end
of CES week brains all fried I'm gonna
say C 180 million pixels I don't know
hey I'm not gonna do any math right now
okay I'm gonna go a C&amp;amp;D C&amp;amp;D is that your
final answer
sure I'm sorry the answers be 133
million pixels on an 8k display cozbie
but you were close you were close
actually Luke overshot he picked D so
you're really technically close to
losing with 240 million my brain was
just like it's got to be massive okay
for to most men x 4 + equals x 3 there
you go yeah everyone got this one wrong
this should this should have been you
did all-time equally dumb just just for
shits and giggles here to see how far
you would have got had you got that one
correct number 3 during the GTA 5
benchmark the can benchmark that we're
talking about here what object is
mounted at the top of the blue canopy
structure during the pleasure pier scene
you know the best part about this is
what I've been charged ETA a ton yep but
I do my own run that's behind around the
king the can benchmark on gta5 like what
really yeah is it it uses that scene
that scene is like 22 second oh no its
comeback lien Valley no one uses that
gene but everyone sees that scene
because it's the one that's not for you
test incorrectly cuz you do that you do
your scripting it's all automated sea
automation that's a killer that has real
value in in manual benchmarking my
friend that benchmark has command line
built into it I'm more of a DIY guy all
right it's kind of like you buy a batch
file on rusick man
that's too efficient Steve and it's
costing you big time right now I I'm
gonna go with I don't think it's an
American flag or a happy face I think it
might be an ice-cream cone or a hotdog
I probably already screwed myself and I
have no clue between the two at all so
I'm gonna go the ice cream I think it's
either an ice cream cone or an American
flag hey you're being I want to say a
happy face but it does not fit with the
others I don't know that happy face that
would be correct the actual answer was
an American flag I see its American flag
it's not just because you're Canadian
that you got I was gonna guess though
your intuition was was pretty correct
there thank you thank you a lot of
number four which of these is not a
feature not a feature that the age 370
chipset has over B 360 a more set of
three ports be more USB 3.1 gen2 on
Forte's see more HS io lanes or D more
PCI you ain't so I think it does have
more SATA ports not sure about the USB
3.1 this is Gen 1 so USB you'd stand at
USB 3 so that's probably also yes
the high-speed i/o I think would be the
same because
that's a that's a by 4 which is
multiplex tough for the high speed i/o I
don't see what how they changed that
PCIe lanes are included in HS iOS but
you've separated them correct
but still there's a possibility that you
could have a different number of HS i/o
lanes and seems highly dependent on the
motherboard manufacturer but this is
going off of Intel's
spec sheet the official factory spec
sheet ok the official spec sheet allows
the motherboard manufacturer to
reallocate HS i/o lands as PCI US would
you say that's the most likely answer
out of the forum which one the same
thing so I will say see more high-speed
i/o leaves I'm gonna go with more
high-speed i/o later the answer is
actually a is the only it's the only
feature on here that is the same number
on both chipsets the answer is actually
a it's a specifically number of say they
both have 6 SATA 3 ports on both
chipsets
everything else page 370 has a slight
leg up I generally thought it had more
all right all right
it's very common for editing work with
very many be boards they have the same
number of SATA ports 6 and 6 whereas you
do get 8 or 12 more HSI elaine's on on
each 375 as well as PCI aliens and the
same same roots number of planes
but multiplexer has changed to it okay I
think that's right yeah yep so you
strike out twice I am just getting
creams here but hey you know what it
isn't the saying three strikes you're
out so technically you might as well
just shoot for the fifth but I think the
same would be I had never cared about H
374 V 360 that's it's question five bit
of a historical question here in 1956
IBM shipped the first hard disk drive in
their RAM Mac 305 system that was
capable of holding how much data a 256
kilobytes B 512 kilobytes C 2 megabytes
or D 5 megabytes I'm gonna say wait how
did that happen how did you do that what
how did you turn into the contestant you
the host you're on my show andrew is
recording them what parallel universe
are we in right now I'm thinking it's B
or C for some reason the 2 megabyte
number stands out to me that's obviously
you trying to trick me play with my head
so we do this full-time get in my head
Kyle it's my job I'm gonna go see two
megabytes Jim Panos dancer you know this
random piece of useless trivia
really Thanks so I'm gonna go with so
Steve's gonna actually use an additional
lifeline here he's actually pulled
someone from the audience and the
audience member is saying is telling
Steve Burgin is here that it's Dee yes I
believe this was 256 responsible quick
response well you're wrong yeah but my
really five megabytes that's actually
way bigger than I thought it was right
cool that's why five megabytes that is
what he says you should probably stick
to him because he's right keep him
around because that's the right answer
what five megabytes ah yeah Wow
see I knew that you would think that I
was trying to trick you by putting the
high and the low as as the non-answers
me back I tricked you double tricked oh
man free ends in Dutch she's a nefarious
game you play here I know it show your
face really quick we need to see the
real brain behind gamers nexus
steve is just a puppet your name sir Jim
yeah thank you the sake Jackie fer thank
you for making him look somewhat smart
like he made me look somewhat stupid but
hey you know what Steve
you still did a great job and I commend
your trolling skills on shows like this
so we have a little consolation prize
