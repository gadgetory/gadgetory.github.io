title down there today we are building a
computer which I admit isn't nearly as
fun as this montage of cats getting
brain freeze but cute kitty calamity or
not
today's video is dressed with a special
kind of sauce for a number of reasons
the first of which being that this marks
the humble beginnings of my PC of the
Month series where I assemble a rig each
month because why the hell not
time-lapses hardware porn and benchmarks
are all things you can expect to see
throughout these videos after each PC is
built it'll either be disassembled so I
can reuse the parts for other content or
it'll be kept intact here in the studio
should I decide it's more useful to me
that way there is another option though
which also happens to be the second
reason why this video is awesome you see
on rare occasions where I have no use
for the PC or its parts I've decided
that it shall be given away in its
entirety to one lucky subscriber of this
channel and that's exactly what we're
going to do today so stay tuned at the
end of the video where I lay out all the
details on how to enter this epic
full-blown PC world wide giveaway wait I
kind of need that
and finally I'm also excited that
today's build celebrates the arrival of
a new flagship chassis that's almost
overwhelming with its robust feature set
meet the dark base Pro 900 from be quiet
the German manufacturer has gone all out
this time with a full tempered glass
side panel a reversible motherboard tray
and dried cage so you can completely
rotate your internal layout and water
cooling supports to the enth degree the
quickest way for me to illustrate just
how seriously this case takes its liquid
cooling is by showing you this diagram
you can see here we get support for a
420 read at the top in front to 80 at
the bottom and 140 at the back a water
cooling pump can be mounted on top of
any of the independent drive trays using
the included pump bracket and removing
enough trays reveals mounts on the hard
drive panel for a tube reservoir the
chassis includes three silent wings
three 140 millimeter pwm fans a PWM
eight fan hub front panel RGB control
with included LED strips and yo dawg i
heard you like integrated qi wireless
chargers so the case has one of those
two needless to say this chassis will
keep most system builders quite busy
with tons of options at their disposal
and I'm looking forward to building with
it today I'd also like to extend a quick
thanks to be quiet for providing this
case and sponsoring today's video in
order to make
a worldwide giveaway possible be quiet
you guys Rock
or should I say you dark rock 3 but
that's not all for our PC of the month
oh no our CPU of the hour is the intel
skylake core i5 6600 k that will be
cooling with a predator 240 AO from EK
water box we should mount nicely to our
gigabyte z170 X Ultra gaming the board
supports u 2m 2 USB 3.1 type C and
features an all-black aesthetic which
should look super stealthy in our rig
for memory I've hand-picked this 4 by 8
gig kit of Crucial Ballistix elite at
2666 giving us 32 gigs of
high-performance ddr4 truth be told I'm
sort of in love with the combat ready
look of these full metal heat spreaders
and I think will match perfectly with
our motherboard because you know what
goes great with black black for our GPU
we have the GTX 970 super super clock
from EVGA the card features the brand's
tried-and-true a CX 2.0 cooler and
judging from the comments on my recent
1084 the win review many of you still
prefer this look to the new design
I find it 26 percent cooler myself you
get a nice factory overclock with plenty
of headroom to manually push the card
even further dare I say 4 gigs of gddr5
and full support for things like DirectX
12 and gsync on the storage front we
have a 2 terabyte WD black and a 250 gig
crucial MX 200 SSD for our boot drive
the MX 2 hundred features impressive
sequential reads and writes and
outstanding write endurance to ensure
longevity despite undertaking heavy
tasks finally powering the system is the
be quiet dark power pro 11 850 watt
power supply and I've thrown in some
orange alchemy extensions from BitFenix
to match the trim of our case which by
the way is also available with black or
silver accents if orange isn't your
taste and those are all the parts for
today's build I put links to all the
hardware in the description below so go
ahead and check those out if you want
more info but without dilly dallying any
further I think it's time we get to
building because I know a tool who's in
desperate need of a good screw like this
one
well that was fun
overall this build went pretty smoothly
and apart from the orange extensions not
quite matching the case accents and mice
at attempted hiding the ketchup and
mustard power supply cables
I think the finished product looks
pretty sweet I understand with be quiet
sponsoring this video every compliment I
toss them right now will likely be
written off as soulless marketing but
for what it's worth the dark Bass Pro
900 is insanely versatile and very fun
to build it I'd love to give it a proper
review actually but as you already know
neither the case or this PC are mine to
keep so let's talk giveaway details
