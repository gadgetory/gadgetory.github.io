how do you know now if it's LIBOR or
liber you don't because we were alive
before now we're even more like we like
them both
not both okay I wanna make sure it's
which is working much much was
functional first hello twitch so that's
which is coming in thanks amazing guys
I think yeah I think I'm just ready to
rock I should do is bring the mouse
around here alright yeah yeah let's do
this for some reason but typing in
YouTube chat doesn't work but it's fine
in twitch yeah that's something to do
with being a pop out baby boomer when
did you close the original window no pop
out opens oh there it goes you know I'm
an idiot we didn't go like this
Vishwanath haven't left you YouTube oh
that's wonderful in you do my dad saying
hello it's gonna be oh hey there in
twitch is still like where the hell are
you guys say all right here I'm an
automatic mode for quite a few of the
show prep things I'm just like I know
how to do this alright autopilot
sometimes doesn't work just as Tesla
let's see
which not working switch failed it even
sells like anyone else see it people are
upset that we're six no seven minutes
late terminate oh god forbid which is
not live yes we know we know working on
it can't switch just freaking out what
happens it's you mean why all right it's
getting the better server now I was
going to a New Mexico server oh that's
not right now what's going to LA so
maybe that'll work you're now I'm
streaming to wish
hey everybody hopefully this works it
didn't immediately fail I've that so it
was trying to go to her the wrong server
I think was what happened before now we
should be streaming to both xre mister
sorry for that technical difficulties
man started the show getting them out of
the way we always do with the big yard
yard
trust me I'm despite the yawn I'm very
excited for this show me too because
it's it's not special though it's
exactly like every other show we've done
but that's that's a good thing but every
show every show is special indeed that's
exactly what I was all up with the
special way Paul gets it um and
hopefully you do too
welcome everybody this is awesome
hardware episode 122 yeah side a we're
gonna be doing side B in about an hour
so we'll be on Paul's Channel Paul's
hardware no youtube.com slash Paul's
hardware this is show we do every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time both
on YouTube and our twitch channel which
is shared between the two of us that's
twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware thank you all very much
for joining us we've got a great show
planned for you all today and if you
guys are new here first off welcome
you're able to catch us live that's
awesome we're glad to have you and this
is a basically a loosely planned to text
show where we talk about text sometimes
and
and have a few beers while we're at it
today we are drinking some well I have
some Anderson Valley oatmeal stout it's
quite delicious thank you Paul from
picking it up I'm gonna be pouring a
double nut brown here which is from
Mammoth Mammoth Mountain Brewing Company
also very good for now we're starting
off with actually there's no bottles of
it over there oh we're drinking a red
that's from Michigan and I you may I
forget the name of it hey yeah look
we'll get we'll get one later and show
you guys but cheers Cheers to all of you
thanks for being here and yep totally
unprecedented we went live to YouTube
before twitch today yeah those totally
my fault until they just me being cam in
automatic mode quicken or anything but
sorry sorry twitch
sorry twitch um you you always come
first all right clickety-click plugs
quick plugs we have our stores we've got
big with tech slash store that's where
I'm selling all my merchandise like
hoodies shirts and beanies fidget
spinners thinking about fidget spinner
we have a female shirts we got you know
stuff for them for the B men it's for
the ladies so the me men get hats mugs
glasses all that sort of thing I saw
that t-shirt contest design is this
t-shirt design contest is still going on
so submit we've got some vintage letting
very quickly sauce and I we're looking
at some of your submissions the other
day and there's some good stuff in there
there's there's no there's cash money
for if we choose your design or even the
concept of your design so if you're at
all
you know talented with any sort of
design work then go ahead and enter
because you might see your design or
something like it
what a good it works go to my website
for the entry page Hales is it loading
for some reason yeah I'm not sure what's
wrong with my site that sucks I've added
some hats hats are on poles well got
these hats with the embroidered
thumbscrew logo on them yep so check
those out mugs are still on sale and
yeah we should have a new shirt coming
soon that that are that Brian made for
us with the awesome hardware on it so
that that's coming soon we got some new
designs of course hopefully coming from
you guys as well all right a quick
oh also pre announcement for the show
right you guys often do donation
comments for us which is awesome we're
gonna do special thing for today which
is that Kyle and his half and then I on
my half are gonna match we're gonna take
your donation comments and donate them
to Puerto Rico and we're also gonna
match your donation comments are you
doing the same thing I'm doing I'm doing
the same thing right up to 500 bucks
will match what is donated so we'll
probably have to tell you that up later
since we're drinking and stuff but so
yeah thanks for your donations and yet
we're gonna send those over to Puerto
Rico cuz they're having a real hard time
right now for anyone who doesn't know
what's going on with Puerto Rico what
for hurricane basically like destroyed
all of their like there's no power on
the entire island so they need they need
help there there's lots of United States
citizens there who are having a rough
time that means none of their computers
are working yeah I don't know any Emily
look we don't the right page I'm sort of
looking at this page there's a link in
the description on my half to this page
we're gonna it's gonna be going to
United for Puerto Rico which is
spearheaded by the first lady of Puerto
Rico and yeah so there you go yep so
it's all for a good cause
go ahead and roll those donations in I
already see a couple dropping in Lucas
and stuff thank you guys so much we'll
be reading those at the end of each half
the episode all right let's let's move
on to our first segment here just hot
and heavy hardware part 1 Paul is also
going to be doing the same segment on
his his half there's lots of lots of
hardware talk but it's all hot and heavy
hell yeah
and the first one I want to talk about
here is from video cards calm they
actually put together this Z 370
motherboard round up card instead of
having first I had like six different
links and then I saw I found this
article oh it's all here and just one
article that's very very nice
consolidation yes so in case you guys
were curious there's just a bunch of
boards here for for the eighth
generation of Intel Core processors
code-named coffee like almost a KB like
their coffee like you've got everything
from as rack boards the Asus gigabyte
MSI even Biostar was jumped into the
to the Z 370 craze um there's plenty of
offerings right from the get-go it's
unclear if whether or not these boards
gonna be available at launch I'm sure
some of them will and some of them won't
cheesy but there's quite quite a
selection yeah from definitely give away
so we have 15 yeah I think it was
actually the first to unveil their
boards officially all the other ones
have been leaked up until this point I
know gigabytes embargo for showing off
their boards was supposed to be later in
the week but some asshole leaked all of
the specifications for coffee like the
cpu stack to Zack so so yeah it kind of
pushed the embargo forward a little bit
I suppose that's cool and now there's a
bunch of board so there's way too many
here to go over individually so many
highlights for us yeah I got a couple
highlights as rod has there Z 370 Taichi
bringing back the Tai Chi I'll just go
over all the flagship swords it's a very
color neutral looks very kind of
steampunk ish get away with that kind of
gear spinning and stuff in the
background well they're not spinning
they're just printed on the PCB
but it looks cool nonetheless it'd be
cool if they can make them spin as rack
ah get on that make your gears spin at
least maybe in the heat sink little
chips yeah I mean it glows right already
halfway there and then that Asus has
their ergy Maximus 10 hero but I
actually rather like they're tough
gaming board the tough gaming board the
tough board looks really cool this time
around looks really nice I'm a big fan
of the tough boards no no thermal armor
the stem around nothing like that but
definitely a cool different different
take than just the common red and black
that we see or just a blackout theme
what's pretty nice and then we've got
kind of yellow yeah it's got some yellow
accents there would make it would have
done great in you know old-school
skunkworks
it looks like there's LEDs behind it too
which hopefully can be disabled yeah I
wonder if they're a single color like to
match the color of the board or if
they're RGB I would almost in this
situation where you've got those yet
little accents on the boards might as
well thank you I'd rather it was just
yellow yeah rather than like an RGB yeah
you're never gonna want to change
anything
captain look nasty gigabytes just a
couple more here do you bite as there is
III 70 or a steaming seven seven which
they actually I think they sent one to
you to write Paul did you get one of
these I think I got the five oh I
believe I get the five counties I'm not
all highfalutin with my gaming seven
well you know got to spend a bunch of
extra money on fluff you should see what
you do you'd be amazed what am I being a
cork in your face can do for you okay
well everyone needs to try get see lots
of it I've been getting a bunch of
7-series mother boys ever since that you
should you should have gone with them
with what's this what's-his-face the
viral log those people yeah side story
my big break finally here after Kyle's
shot the beer in his face two weeks ago
here and it was very funny viral hog hit
hit actually hit me up I think cuz they
went through the the twitch channel yeah
an offer to monetize it basically which
which means that any reuse of that
around the internet they would go after
and say pay us money for that and then
they would be giving you a cut of it
yeah we said no no yes yes some people
do that that's fine that's fine you have
an intellectual property whatever but
like so many people have reused that
hilarious ways like would you would you
really want each person who did that to
get some like hey you just use this yeah
that's like well that's me and the gift
and that's you know like I deserve like
everything no one else can use this like
come on it's it's hilarious it deserves
to be shared for by everyone for free
it's it's it would be appropriate to
protect that sort of thing in certain
situations but it's like that a funny
gift or whatever there yeah people
trying to profit off everything these
days
holy alright um last thing I'll say
here is the biostar offerings there's
two boards here but they are gold so
maybe we'll bring back the golden build
know the coke
hip cowl needs to make a turn Noel
should come back that would be gold with
our jiu-ge
strip right there extra naughtiness
because no one else brilliant Wow and
even like the graphic like doesn't look
flattering on it well it's very like
angular on the right here and then for
this side of it here they're like we
want it wavy yeah like it's a way to be
on this side over here with very sharp
sharp edges it's like on the right sides
like Tron on the left is like Moana yeah
but they do look like this heat sink I
will say for their MDOT to heat sink
does actually look like a heat sink it
looks like their caps in it's like
aluminum yeah yeah that might actually
do something so that and there's two of
them yes I mean it's just some planet
that's functional 370 boards we'll be
talking more about coffee lake and xiii
70 and sort of the controversy
surrounding the latest launch from intel
soon enough later on the show but moving
on to EVGA is an latest video card this
is the gtx 1080 TI for the win 3 maybe
like the names are just getting longer
and longer elite for the win 3 elite G's
they need to put a top on the end you
Asus used to put tower top right in
front elite top sports weight sports oh
no no that's just the headline just
that's just mark Tyson making them the
elites top sports edition it's just a
verb oh we need your voice maybe what's
gaming on everything they need to start
putting sports in there alright sorry
what about eSport marketers that's a
there's a that's a gold mine right there
alright so so what's different about
this card is that it's rockin 12
gigabits per second gddr5 okay as
opposed to I believe it's 8 gigabytes
okay someone messaged me the other day
and tried to tell me they they're like
they put 12 gigs on it and as I know
NVIDIA what let them do that no they
wouldn't do that and is he kind of
pointless that's where you pay you have
to pay like an extra 300 bucks for that
or something and to get a Titan XP right
exactly so 12 gigahertz we're talking
gddr5 x4 giving us a GTA 5 earlier on a
352 bus running at 1200 and six
megahertz this is gonna offer up to five
hundred and twenty eight gigabytes per
second of memory bandwidth which is
pretty insane about 9% better than
previous 1080i models
according to EVGA and question is is
that gonna equate to nine percent better
gaming performance well surely it's I
mean probably it scales in a linear
fashion not not exactly Paul's being
facetious of course this is just for you
know there are some applications I will
admit we're faster memory bandwidth or
increased memory bandwidth is going to
benefit gaming strictly high level
overall not so much but again you got to
see what your needs are as a user black
and white options available so they gab
yeah I would have to imagine that all
there are other colored shrouds that
they have for this because it's the same
shroud design right right as the the
other 1080 T I'm super nice 1080 I chose
not elite or whatever so yeah my
question is still do that purple
perfectly had they brought purple mmm
to the 1080i showed me that it'd be
pretty easy to spray-paint it's like if
they actually do that they're gonna like
force me to make it build with it or
something I think a purple building I
think kind of fun like purpose royalty
so moving on here was our last little
article for hot and heavy hardware
because we got a lot of other stuff talk
about fantasy has announced their latest
budget case the Eclipse p300 this is one
step down from the P 400 which is a
great budget case that I've worked with
in the past it's a fantastic for the
price this one's only 60 bucks 60
dollars exceed that it looks nice and
it's probably the shitty piece of
Plexiglas actually full-blown tempered
glass oh my goodness yes I'm not exactly
sure how look at the spec sheet look how
sexy so you can do up to two hundred and
eighty millimeter ad a terse at the
front and 120 up top so water cooling
support
not bad for 60 bucks full metal exterior
RGB lighting and it's got you know
magnetic dos filter full-size GPU
clearance along with ATX power so it's
pretty solid for $60 yeah I mean we saw
this we saw this at a when do we see at
Computex
yes yeah and it was it looked it looked
really closing to the P 400
yeah in fact I can't even think about I
think the p400 has more mounting options
at the top for Rainiers but that's I
can't I can't member much else and I
believe that's a steal that's a steal at
$60 this is a $60 a budget case killer
oh yeah here big time if anyone wants to
see more on this this isn't linked
because I just pulled it up right now
but go to hardware connects because
Demetri reviewed this and if you want to
watch a case review you want to watch
Dimitri's case of you yes indeed or you
want to watch ours of course or ours but
look look how sexiest b-roll is today
yeah thanks oh yeah I spotted this
that's some dust filters in there let's
just do a let's do a reaction video to
Dimitri's yeah p300 bonk I'll react to
hardware connects I like the plant and
look at the pop pop color and the other
way even like his it's like when I want
to take a videos like I just need to
record this thing it's sitting on my
desk right now it looks terrible just
point you everywhere even his shot
of just his desk it's all you know still
looks still super clean and
professionals that slider breath look at
that sweater he's wearing it's got the
nice texture to it yeah it's providing
you with a better appreciation of the
depth and the quality of the camera lens
he's using and it's perfectly it's
perfectly color balance I like I really
like the texture actually on that
sweater bringing the plant back what's
this plants name I forget his plants
name
jaysus planty planty super original J
yep and then I don't know I don't know
if there's a name for someone who chat I
think it's good we cannot even you know
until we know the name of his plant Fred
it's right Jack seems to be saying it's
for it that's right
that sounds familiar Fred also the name
of the massive or breeder or orb weaver
spider that's in my backyard I'm gonna
kill it later it's it's awesome no all
right well on to our next segment which
is pimp my PC yay guys you've submitted
your ugly systems
Paul and I are gonna help you out
because man these things are a piece of
work starting with Adam let's take a
your system here Adam actually Adams
isn't too bad he's got see the specs are
somewhere in here no they're not no
specs specs are in the photos he says
there we go so we've got an AMD FX 6100
CPU with a course here each 100 cool on
that thing 16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance
to GTX 560 s guess you don't need a
heater in the winter and then a total 50
gig Samsung 850 Evo along with thermal
take chaser mk1 case I hate stupid thing
I've frickin clear and then dust yes as
part of a spec sheet dust that's
thrilling those little six plus years
worth it does get cleaned occasionally
okay well Adam yeah I think I think this
is pretty solid in terms of you know how
do you how you have everything laid out
I think the cable management just
because you have two graphics cards that
both require you know dual PCIe plugs I
think it gets a little cluttered there
perhaps you could do some velcro II or
tie downs with the PCIe cables alone I
like to if I'm doing SLI or crossfire I
like to have all the PCIe cables
converge to one cable before it goes
into the into the grommet
I like your sweet triple monitor
surround setup that's pretty cool
it's pretty nice that's a wallpaper if
he's like watching the videos like that
it looks animated I bet that's a screen
saver or something yeah you might guess
pretty cool we need we need to ditch
this SLI cable yeah there's plenty of
options stopper colors not doing me any
favors
better options there there's definitely
some some clashing between your case
accent colors with the blue and the
motherboard accents with the red and
Parris fly and whatever right so you can
remove the power supply stickers yeah if
you wanted to make it more color neutral
and hard hard hard to hard to reconcile
the Thermaltake blue case accents with
the motherboard
however if you were to remove this sli
bridge and then also remove those
stickers on the power supply and then of
course this guy mentioned some general
cable management could do some some
some benefits here then I think the blue
in the red would be more forgivable you
seem less hodgepodge I mean yeah you'd
have mainly blue red black with a touch
of brown on the motherboard but that's
also that's not too much should be done
there true
but yeah nice nice older build there I
mean it's pretty solid overall yeah and
you get a nice triple miners yep thanks
Adam for sending that in we've got
flouse surf loud with an i7 4770k of
ddr3 an h 81 motherboard the gigabytes
881 s to bpv gtx 960 to gig graphics
card a 600 watt 80 plus power supply
80 plus is just 80 plus not even bronze
I mean any plus is fine I'm put five
terabyte
Seagate hard drive bought all of it for
four hundred and twenty dollars it's a
really good deal 420 blaze it let's see
what I like alright I was I had so many
impressions of this before he said the
price yeah and then $420 447 really good
that's I mean for the whole system it's
good that's pretty solid here alright
now you want it you want an upgrade to
to an SSD that's something you want to
do that that will overall the single
greatest thing you could do to make your
computer seem a lot faster would be to
get an SSD and keep that 1.5 terabyte
hard drive just use that as storage drop
an SSD in there you can get them cheap
spend forty to fifty dollars for a
little 244 240 ish now I keep the prices
cube you get one for like a good one for
like 70 yeah yeah and then that will
greatly improve improve things other
than that I mean it's perfectly
functional you could your your your CPU
has a decent amount of headroom still I
would say above that gtx 960 so you can
even potentially upgrade that if you
wanted to
oh yeah aesthetically I mean you're
dealing with a with a cheap power supply
with crappy cables it's not we're
sleeping or whatever it just be a power
supply put replacements right that
you're looking at but I mean you've got
a 500 watt 80 plus bronze
I think it's just a b-plus actually EVGA
unit so you know that there may not be
where it's also hard to it's hard to
justify spending money on on aesthetics
inside of a case like this because the
case isn't anything glamorous it
probably doesn't have like a super nice
side panel window to appreciate
everything on the inside so maybe
consider you know I mean you've already
got some good fundamentals here the CPU
is great gtx 960 as paul said is is good
could definitely use an upgrade maybe in
the future but you know maybe consider a
1080 it's totally adequate yep consider
maybe uh maybe getting a new case i
don't know every keys on the case can
really be a huge huge game changer when
stepping up the appearance a bit an SSD
first SSD first it may be like a power
supply cpu cooler upgrade but the power
supply cpu cooler upgrade will be in
anticipation of replacing the core
components after that yeah as much as we
critique aesthetics unpin my pc once we
got it yeah you got to go with the
performance first that's loud schrick
sure I can't management's not pretty but
I'm getting some sleeping so he's
planning to get cable sleeping right so
60 at 50 K though an i7 double GTX 10
80s in SLI 32 gigs of ram and it looks
like the corsair 6 but what is it 680
right that's a 787 ATT remember the case
yeah the case I think yeah yeah Wow
ok it looks like you've done a lot of
zip tying here which is good I don't
know not for this today I love zip tying
is but there is resting like the the
cables for your fans it seems like a lot
of fan cables are getting routed along
with the bigger cables at your PCIe and
your eight-penny ps4 the CPU you've kind
of just routed your fan cables along
with these larger cables when in the
case you're using you have a ton of room
behind that motherboard
yeah the motherboard tray to house all
of those smaller cables where you don't
actually need to zip tie or
cable tie any of them to the side of the
case you can put this all behind the
motherboard this kind of strikes me like
I don't want to presume as far as how
many times you've built a computer but
this seems to me like maybe a first time
or hasn't built computers too much got
everything installed
it's like install the power supply and
then just like plug in things where you
know they're supposed to plug in right
right which and get which gets things
working and then just decided to like
well that's it's functional so let's go
ahead and zip-tie some stuff around but
yeah you know I applaud the effort but
yeah this looks for Indus as far as the
cable management goes wells
look there's even like some white zip
ties back here randomly for some SATA
cables and stuff like that that's really
interesting like oh why so funny I don't
know I'm not even like bored earning
even your have to show you um so I think
I think and this is his first built he
mentioned it is his first time
so is this first okay so why I mean you
did a great job for your first time it
looks like everything's routed to the
right headers but as Paul said when it
comes to cable management it's more so
about the journey that the cable takes
more so than the destination of course
you could just plug in you know whatever
you know cable into the appropriate
header but how you route it and how it
actually gets there is pretty important
if you want a tidy looking system so
okay so we got he said extensions are
coming so it's gonna be rewired
flip flip your power supply please
it's it's not horrible with the fan
facing up but honestly you have a dust
filter at the bottom of this case that
you can take advantage of by flipping it
yeah and then of course just just use
use your area behind the motherboard to
read all your cables and then like I
again I applaud the effort with the zip
ties apply that effort behind the
motherboard tray well where you should
find lots of tie-down points and that
kind of thing to get together and you
will have a very nice-looking and very
powerful a little system thing yep and
again for first time build a very very
nice job hell of a system is you for
your first one oh yeah good lord at that
6850 that's it's pretty nice alright
Danny Danny mile are you
you think my PC need an upgrade ketchup
and mustard cables and Verizon is a must
ha ha ok so looks like he's got ok no so
that doesn't mean he has a rising system
currently right no he doesn't this is a
cyber this is a cyber PowerPC as you can
tell by the cyber PowerPC logo down
are you sure it's not just like a badge
he threw on I doubt it I really don't
think people buy case badges for
boutique main expect the same pair of
boutique I don't know if she anyway
there their system integrator but yeah
you usually don't get that type of
branding on a case unless it's provided
by the system building came from
somewhere else
I guess possibly but that's that's the
impression it just doesn't look like
well I guess labor power has a full
range of yeah cyber power provides
countless options unfortunate customers
as well as premium customers at night
today's episode is brought to you by
cyberghost happens to be tied into that
we're not spots what a sneaky brand
integration call so yeah let's see first
off ketchup and mustard ketchup and
ketchup and mustard cables got to go
yeah
you've got a power supply basement to
hide any sort of extension connections
that you need just store all the excess
down there doesn't even have to be super
pretty this is the more important side
so maybe get some black sleeved
extensions also know maybe swap out
those those those dims those modules for
some blue ones that match the
motherboard that look kind of nice then
again you've also got the red on your
you could already on card you could also
potentially do a mod on these I mean if
you're if you're willing to heat the the
heat spreaders you know and paint them
individually and then reapply them you
know that could be a cost-effective way
of color coordinating some stuff true
but I wouldn't bother buying extensions
for this power supply unless I knew what
the power supply was if it is a cyber
power PC and just to prove that we're
not sponsored by them if you get their
base level stuff the power supplies that
they put in their god-awful
is it are they still doing it like that
ok my past in my past experience I can't
speak for the past couple years but they
have an
house brand power supplies that are just
oh yeah if it's house brew they're there
yeah their budget basements garbage and
you would spend more on the extensions
than you would on a replacement new
better power supply so double check that
first if it's a decent 80 plus bronze
rated power supply then then you're okay
well you know even if he got extensions
for it he could still use those
extensions for a new power supply later
I would upgrade the power supply first
oh yeah Larry's brighter yeah all right
thank you very much Danny and let's see
we got one more here Nana Stern Nick mr.
Nick has looked fine until I added my
various components and the bottom left
became crowded no place to hide those
cables no power supply shrouds so this
is a define harass in the looks of it
and yes I feel with the same issue with
with hot line yeah it's it's kind of
frustrating now that we have all these
you know $60 cases thanks Fran texts
that have built-in power supply shrouds
um it can be frustrating but you know it
looks like you've done an okay job here
it does look a bit cramped I feel like
maybe you could pull the cables from the
other side of the motherboard tray just
a little bit more top looks like some
rumor kind of loose especially like the
HD audio I think that might be a it's
USB 2.0 it's been a while since I worked
in this case but I feel like isn't there
a small gap down here you should be like
a grommet or something that I'll say
yeah there should be a little cut of it
where you might be able to bypass some
stuff through rather than having to
brass it all through down here right
look for the little cutouts if it's too
small and you're like there's no way
it's gonna fit it's because you probably
need to remove the power supply first in
order to get some of those cables
through all right some he what he needs
work that you should try that and then
also what's going on with the fan cable
yet so this is gonna say mr. Nick here
obviously you have some you're paying
some attention to aesthetics you have
cable combs you have the sleeving thing
going on for you for your coarser h100
iv2 I believe that's an H 100 IV - yeah
so yeah there's there's just some minor
things I feel like they could really
help
I think matching your front intake fans
would look a little bit better yeah I
don't know yeah make them all those I
like those NZXT ones fine yeah you
nice and then even in the back use that
second fan for everything right there
gaps up here where you could pass
through like a fan the fan plug I'm
thinking yeah and it looks like there's
plenty of length because he actually
dipped I'd the case there tied up right
here so you see if you can pass those
back there I feel like there should be
some gaps up here that are knees and
then the electrical tape thing I have
done this myself and use electrical tape
inside a build to hide cables and wrap
around things and stuff it's just not a
very good long-term solution yeah
electrical tape the the Houston adhesive
on it it's not good long-term and it
will eventually with the heat and the
computer start to wear out and peel off
and just leave grams residue on stuff
and it's it's really hard to make it
look good and clean - so I recommended a
different solution for that as well yep
all right all right thank you very much
Nick those are all the submissions for
Pitt my PC although we do have one more
one honorable mention here this one
comes from Team oh wait I didn't get
that leg missed that one there you go
it's a pretty good one it's pretty good
Paul we don't want to miss it this is
he's using a damn case one of the damn
case a for SFX
options with a 7600 K as e170 I 16 gigs
of DDR 4 GTX 1070
450 watt MMX power supply and an m2 SSD
of 256 gigs I think this is just a
really clean looking mini ITX system I
mean incredibly tiny footprints here in
the damn case and everything's really
well managed as far as the cabling goes
it's amazing how clean it looks despite
the tiniest little space that you had to
work in yeah and let's see the only
thing here is that you've got a 7600 K
which I don't know how much mileage you
get out of that in terms of overclocking
with that tiny little knock to a cooler
I mean don't get me wrong knock 2 is a
great brand I'm sure it performs well
for what it is but putting something
like the 7600 K that can hit you know 5
gigahertz pretty easy I'm not sure I'm
not sure if an unlocked processor it's
impossible because I think that he might
be able to overclock a little bit I'm
not sure
I believe I can't say this for sure off
the top of my head but I believe the
7600 K does run at a little bit higher
frequency bass and boost than the 7600
by itself so there might be a slight
benefit there yeah I was gonna say this
is the same Asus z170 motherboard that I
I believe the gaming Pro that I did the
mod on oh yeah spray-painting yeah I
just I got you you can get rid of this
this cover on the missile heatsink right
here and I removed the heat sinks for
the V RMS and spray painted them right
but I mean you got it honestly that
looks fine as is so yeah this is an
honorable mention anyway we're not
supposed to critique it yep no you're
right it's perfect okay thanks team up
if my PC let's move on to face off yay
we've got a game Paul and I are gonna
play it and I'm just gonna have to do
something stupid
this one's really stupid what do stupid
things this is a this game I felt was
really appropriate because it's a sword
fight oh yeah so Paul and I are gonna
sword fight on my half of the show for
once can't make it a good sized graphics
body fat Rhett actionscript grab the
mission by keyboard on their cable on it
yeah yeah prepare to get sleeve fun oh I
should I should unmute the tab - yeah
wait it looks like it might be on no
it's muted unmute yes yeah the ambiance
all right so I'm a full effect so I'm
let's play a player oh I should
hopefully show people let's see which
buttons here so I'm WASD and spacebar is
my attack so the the objects Paul is not
necessarily to kill each other but it's
you walk through the other person's gate
oh so I have to walk through your gate
you have to walk your mind and the way
you break down the door to the other
person's gate is by hitting them into it
so you actually have to knock them back
into the door and every time that the
door that did to link cracks a little
bit alright I found my attack the only
one attack button so it's very simple
game and let's kill each other now all
right you know the bitch oh oh oh no no
that's cheating you're cheating see how
you cracked my door I think records
aren't a good no crap y'all's wait I
can't tell which one I am
oh oh man wait that doesn't work I
should be able to just hang over it in
yes
wait lonely way the only way into mine
the only way you can do no I can't
that's the way you can beat me and I'm
Justice tani I'm just got turtle
no no fair alright well how did you go
that no the physics in this game are way
off
we'll say ah no wrong way no dammit
oh yeah gonna break your spacebar come
get me
yeah this is probably kick camp like
that no camping all right fine
where's your honor I also realize like
you have no health so it doesn't matter
how many times right no we can't just
kill each other I'm trying to turn it
around this game has some flaws yeah
all right if it Inc I didn't see I don't
know these tests the games before yeah
and then when I do you're like wow you
practiced this game you cheater right oh
come on
yes yes
eat it nope work in my torch away
because they're getting really worn down
I'm so good I think I've mastered
missile you have no oh no hey yeah aah
dog distraction no no no it's all part
of my plan why did how did we hit each
other from opposite sides that we both
went backwards hey that was a little
weird man let me have a word with the
developer it's probably like some
five-year-old kid Evanson chats like two
hours later never is oh come on you guys
can't you guys can't tell me you're not
completely enthralled by their services
oh the turn around turn around shutting
Oh No I thought I had the timing down
skilled with the so nice using finesse
defense against me sir really well my
door to just die coming here actually
getting there yeah yeah alright
I never host times no hey keep going
you win okay I win I'm okay to say that
I win that round to win this game
actually know that I'm pro MLG player
I'm gonna start testing the games a
minute 60 seconds just make sure that
it's not peer garbage apparently it's
what she wants us to keep playing 69
more round it nothing will ever get done
if we keep playing that game so the
punishment for today Paul yeah I'm sure
it's fair perhaps you wouldn't have
given up so easy had you known what the
punishment was ahead of time probably
not today's punishment before you bring
this out of your bag
I want to point something out okay Kyle
forgot his laptop today I did he's
coming to do the live show over here
forgot the laptop yep or I was
protecting my laptop from but near
spillage that's but you remembered
did you remember I remembered I'm so
focused on bringing the punishment
object for today's base of I forgot my
laptop today's punishment object which
is going to be for Paul is this tube of
lipstick tart
litter surgeons liptint I'll be putting
this on he'll be applying a healthy coat
of a moody tarte lipsurgence lip lip
tint okay to Paul's face and you'll have
to wear it for hours they have to wear
for the rest of my half of the show okay
are you ready are you ready Paul I've
actually never done this before
believe it or not what is the Sun I
guess it goes with all that I was I was
okay with it yeah assuming you were
gonna do a really good job give me a
nice pout give you a pound to gloss
finish or whatever okay
all right here we go let's see it all
right I'll try to do it I'll do it
left-handed because I'm what do you do
what are you supposed to do any game am
I supposed to go like I think he just I
think you just leave your lips relaxed
okay relax
anytime I look at wifey sauce she's just
kind of just like doing a more relaxed
type of tint all right I'll try I'll try
to make it pretty
I'll try to not actually make it
completely hideous like like it and then
all right we got the upper lip here all
right so yeah it's kinda like a sharpie
I mean I've used sharpies in the past no
don't don't drool it's not part of the
process we're gonna try to not drool
just a little bit more on the end and
we're good just watching check beautiful
absolutely beautiful look at that Wow
fabulous but you know what their plans
got more brightly colored than I was
expecting
there are plenty of well respected yeah
why he saw choice plenty of
well-respected guys who wear lipstick a
Bruce Jenner or face Caitlyn sorry why
is it taste weird um the Joker
probably anyway you look great you wear
it well poem and drink beer like any
other woman does or any other person who
wears lipstick area oh wow now that's
offensive
I am triggered in before somebody else
says it also also realizing now that I
like I can't touch my my lips at all I
guess well that's good what you've been
thinking and I want to do something like
never realized all right all right well
let's get our half of the show with over
with all right I I will do you that
service sir let's start off with some
news to talk about the Intel Core i 979
ATX II and the 79 60 X which were both
deleted and by our friends our good
friends at gamers Nexus this article is
from Steve Steve Burke Tech Jesus and
are you reading chat pivot like the
clown in the it movie but we were gay so
Steve did some testing obviously with
both of these chips he got some tips he
sought out sign up some tips from devour
professional world renowned overclocker
and actually used his deleting tool to
deal it both of these CPUs and then he
actually proceeded to use liquid metal
in place of intel's crappy stock Tim or
thermal interface material just to
compare the temperatures and third you
know like temps and and power loads and
things like that so the applied liquid
metal to the IHS then anyway then he
withdrew to his Steve cave and actually
made a video as well this is just better
than us in every way he writes articles
and makes videos from his Steve I've
made a video on this damn he didn't read
an article on it then he was drew did
Steve King while he was you know doing -
thing actually when I was watching this
on my phone it looked a lot darker oh
yeah now he well he's like in a hotel
room and it's apparently 1 a.m. and it's
kind of creepy because he's talking all
dark like I thought he was sick or
something he's talking all quiet but are
you just just trying not to wake the
neighbors anyway we're getting off topic
here he did apply some liquid metal and
compared the temperatures between stock
Tim from Intel and liquid metal and with
the deal itting thrown in with the the
liquid metal he was able to hit 4.8 or
yeah up to four point eight gigahertz
at one point two for 1.25 on the bid
which gave the CPU a 25 to 30 percent
performance increase over stuff hit you
chat which is insane
keep it going chat
it's all benign but now they will know
it doesn't even matter what I say I
could just say
 they're gonna be focused on
your and your lipstick the whole time
but they were able to cut down the
temperatures as well by about 40 degrees
you know on average more or less which
is insane which means they were also
able to cool the the chips with
something like a crack at X 60 to 280
millimeter AIO at reasonable noise
levels before they then the D letting
temperatures were very high and they had
to resort to pretty extreme cooling
solutions with fairly loud ambient or
fairly loud noise lots of noise
emissions otherwise so basically there
are some downsides to this power
efficiency the CPUs have been proven to
be wildly inefficient in certain
applications with what they what they
found to be upwards of 500 watts even
more power consumption from the CPU
alone not even the whole system Paul
you're something to share with the class
no I'm so distracted right now I'm
trying to get through this segment
alright so uh I don't know it's it's a
bittersweet thing right if you deal it
it it can break even though it's really
power of hungry but at the same time you
need to deal it it like you need to buy
the living tool or you know god help you
forget to try to do it without one which
risks damaging your CPU permanently and
yeah I mean modding is required if you
really want to make the most of the
either of these CPUs and you want to
unlock their full potential some modding
is required so bear that in mind and
let's not forget the fact that these are
priced significantly higher than AMD's
rise in thread Ripper nineteen fifty X
for example with the 79 80 X being
double the price for only about what
we've found on average to be about 10%
of a performance game in several
applications so um thank you very much
Steve for that article and your your
hard work and research as always we do
appreciate it
you guys go ahead and check out gamers
nexus if you haven't yet read that
from word for me thing that I found
stood out most to me about the about
Steve if I'm if I can get serious here
for a second
oh oh you're gonna get serious yeah like
that okay was when he was running
prime95 and granted this isn't it this
is in a situation where it's a it's an
absolute stress test on the cpu and it's
nothing that you're ever gonna see
practically speaking in real life or
whatever but prime95 l FFT is what he's
running and it's there's a there's a
runaway thermal situation where even
where it just spikes the power spikes
the the temps spike and yeah it goes
kind of crazy at the end so that that
was what I thought was most compelling
yeah but Steve's investigation was
finding that situation where you can
have a CPU like this the cost two grand
that you can run at stock and with this
test can just have a situation where
like you thermally like even with the
next crack in X 62 wasn't even even able
to keep up with it but oh yeah
definitely simply consider I'm sure you
guys are listening very attentively to
all that stuff they're definitely paying
attention to your lips maybe more so
than your words it seemed to notice you
paying more attention to my lips Cal
well you know makeup is a multi-billion
dollar business for a reason Paul I'm
feeling a little let's not get into it
right now
you look great thank you I feel pretty
yeah moving on
Katie Lake KB Lake allegedly
incompatible with xiii cemani the latest
chipset from intel for their main stream
platform of eighth generations of course
cpus and it is incompatible pc
perspective this is scott michaud's
article thank you very much Scott
Katie Lake however will fit physically
it'll fit into the analogy 1151 socket
on Z 370 z 370 coffee like it uses the
same LGA 1151 socket in fact from what
we can tell in pictures all the contacts
that both KB Lake and calculates share
the same contact layout on the bottom of
the CPUs so what's to say that one can't
work with the other in terms of you know
motherboard and CPU
okay okay what what is it yeah this it's
that it's no one thing it's a steady
stream of Awesomeness just everyone in
YouTube just saying gay gay gay like
know this more there's more nuance to it
than that
okay Paul's not gay but it's husband
it's not funny at all where was I okay
so this is this is this is a topic of
controversy because a lot of people are
upset that coffee lake is coming out
just eight months after Katie link and
with a new motherboard no less a new
chipset that Intel sort of forcing upon
its users intel is claiming that the new
chipset is required for coffee lake due
to certain changes being needed on the
the power delivery side of things to
account for the initial course can't I'm
just gonna not look at you for the rest
of the show um additional cores and
threads that requires changes to be made
on the power delivery front and that's
why they need to update the chipset
whether or not that's a bunch of
bollocks is a matter of opinion at this
point there's no way we can confirm
right now but let us know what you guys
think and checked among all the comments
on Paul's new appearance is his new fab
look let us know what you think about
Intel and essentially doing what seems
to be a firmware lock out with Katie
like NZ 370 but we'll have more to say
on that in our respective reviews let's
move on to our next story here Microsoft
and Facebook are laying a 160 terabits
per second cable 4,100 miles across the
Atlantic this is the highest capacity
subsea cable to ever cross the Atlantic
Ocean 160 terabits per second is
equivalent to streaming 71 million HD
videos at the same time and 116 million
times faster than an average home
internet connection
the cable is gonna be operational by
early 2018 which is right around the
corner that's going to Bilbo it's going
to Bilbo Baggins Oh Oh build a vein
Bilbao and Bilbao Spain know about its
called Maria the cable actually has a
name that's how massive it is who's ever
name to keep I like this shot of the
inside of the ship that it's on like
that's really cool
oh yeah it's cool I didn't realize that
that's that's the cable it's a pretty
mess whenever I hear about undersea
cables I'm always reminded reminded of
sphere by Michael Crichton the novel not
the horrendous movie that was made based
on it because that's how it all starts
in that and that is an undersea Kamath
Wow wait way to spoil the movie Paul
that's literally it's the beginning this
is a very beginning yes like if you read
yeah the beginnings my favorite part of
every movie I always wonder now no movie
starts so what's up with this cable well
it's it's made up of eight pairs of
fiber-optic cables
enclosed by copper so it's probably
probably expensive and it's uh it lies
17,000 feet below the ocean surface
spanning between Virginia Beach which is
guess what in Virginia and the city of
bilbo baggins in Spain funny that they
would have a city called bilbo baggins
both Microsoft and Facebook have large
data center operations in Virginia which
explains why the cable starts in
Virginia due to increasing demand for
data flows across the Atlantic this
cable was laid this is just gonna help
the companies
control the massive amounts of data flow
between each of these continents these
countries and I guess this is we're
starting to see a trend here with tech
companies now funding their own
infrastructure their own new cables
instead of joining like telecom
consortiums which operate existing
undersea cables so they're going rogue
tech companies are going rogue building
their own cables
third party cables haha and the project
was done in two years it just finished
which is three times faster than
expected them cable layers are grinded
they are hauling ass and Google you guys
are you know Google's always just right
there at the cutting edge of everything
they've already invested in two cables
that are going for the other way from
u.s. to Japan over the Pacific South
America and other Asian countries as
well they have connected cables all
across the globe this one that Microsoft
and Facebook mate just laid is going to
is gonna lead to improvements hopefully
in cloud services like Facebook's
Facebook as well as their other sites
that Instagram and whatsapp and
Microsoft's cloud products like what is
it
Microsoft cloud want onedrive and office
365 things like that so um yeah big ass
cables gettin laid drop the key but it's
never good ring to it but if it's pipe
then you can be laying pipe they in pain
but that's that doesn't that's what I
say when I when I am cable when I take a
 alright alright let's move on to
our next story here Paul actually tossed
the story to me he found it thank you
Paul
did you thank me for it by making me
wear lipstick yeah well you know I work
in mysterious ways
I couldn't resist pub G creators are
unhappy with fortnight Battle Royale
and they're considering further action
legally once some epic games which is
love you know it sort of has worked with
Blue Hole the developer of pub G in the
past in fact pub G is based off of epics
Unreal Engine 4 so there's a bit of a
relationship here but epic games
apart from Blue Hole and pub G they
announced the pub G inspired battle
royale variant of their game fortnight
which is a sandbox survival game
released for free on consoles and PC
starting next week sandbox survival
games sounds a lot like pub G
a blue hole there one of the reps Cheng
Han Kim said after listening to the
group feedback from our community and
reviewing the gameplay for ourselves
we're concerned that fortnight's may be
replicating the experience for which pub
ji is known so if you look at it if you
look at the gameplay I mean the artwork
the art design is completely different
it's very much like cartoony all right
it's got some design there that's I
think the biggest difference that you're
ready and realistic enough it's not
pretty realistic but everything else
looks very very Pub G ish maybe not the
crafting elements like the guys building
the wall or building some sort of fort
there but just the fact that it's an
open world sandbox battle royale style
seems very similar and you know there's
there's a huge huge controversy here as
well are they copying do they have a
right to do this
does Epic Games have a right to make a
battle royale game similar to pub G will
be arguing this on Paul's half of the
show we will all right let's move on
though to our last article for today for
my half which is the gtx 1070 TI holy
smokes wait I thought this was a hoax
mm-hmm it wasn't it turns out to be true
more or less we alluded to this we
talked about this assigning I think it
was somewhere in Asia there was a spec
sheet on a digital screen it said 1070
TI paul and i looked at and we're like
that's stupid that can't be valid now
that's definitely a typo they meant to
write dt x 1080 TI obviously yeah no
holy crap it seems like nvidia is just
crazy enough to release something like a
1070 TI but this is actually pretty cool
um guru 3d has conferred with an
anonymous industry source that the GPU
that's going to be is the GP 104 300
this is now a confirmed fact they say
with a confirmed release date of late
October this might expect this might
match up with gigabytes teaser that they
recently dropped where it was a you know
the clowns
a scary clown and there's no yet it's it
was back roses at TI dance at TI so the
fact that was a scary clown maybe hates
baby you know
were holding lunch so that's kind of
cool
my drivers posted info on specs that may
or may not be accurate the GPU has 20
share clusters I love anyone who has
joined the show for like the last third
very different than I was expecting and
then the rest of chat just making up
bullet disasters bollocks reasons why
you're wearing lipstick didn't you hear
all just came out like 20 minutes ago
hey I'm doing pinup not some pinup
modeling work lately so came right from
the shoot just didn't have time to watch
the makeup yeah this puts a whole new
meaning to probing Paul just just
throwing that out there
so we've got 20 shader clusters this is
all speculative specs by the way just
one would be disabled totally in 20 432
just 128 shader procs lower than the GTX
1080 so as Vic that's if that's true
it's closer to the 1080 than it is a
1070 which is a good thing
I would think clock speeds possibly
higher than a GTX 1070 at 1600 and 7
megahertz and a GPU boost 3.0 clock of
16 hundred and eighty-three megahertz
with 8 gigahertz gddr5 effective memory
lock yeah yeah hundred eighty watt TDP
similar to the GTX 1080 just over 8
teraflops in performance Hilbert
hagedorn which is the author of this
article
thank you very much Hilbert speculates
an MSRP of around 399 us I don't even
know you can get a gtx 1070 for that
price right now so perhaps we're looking
at a 1070 price drop is what I would
think of course as the mining craze
continues or dies down I'm not exactly
sure where it's at right now it seems to
be slowing down a little bit I provide a
lot of competition for the for the Vega
Vegas in 56 I think
I was gonna say for nothing because
there's no competition in the $300 price
range well the free oh yeah but I mean
if you can get a 1017 now if you send 70
becomes 3 you can actually buy it for
350 or 300 then that makes a lot of
sense yeah by the way chat I did I only
I only typed this in a chat and it
mentioned very much but I told I told
you guys my ransom was 100 dollars if
there's a $100 donation to Kyle then
I'll do it
then you'll do what Oh pound the beer
sure
I'm scared I don't know we go cousin he
the one that would mean that Kyle would
also have to donate $100 to - oh yeah
teleport Oh Riko so no to match well I
have to match now otherwise I look like
a dick so whatever you know you don't
get that kind of action for free you
don't need electricity what I'm saying
alright that's gonna do it for my half
of the show although we do have some
Egyptians end of the show end of the
show festivities yeah
Kyle's have to carry on so we've got
donations we got tons of donations from
you guys thank you so much again we're
gonna be matching everything you guys
donate for today to the folks in Puerto
Rico because we're going through some
hard and then wall I'd say wall

one thing we're trying to figure out
where to do donations like where can we
actually figure out to send money where
we know it will actually do good so true
that's part of the reason why I chose
this article because it lists that's
quite a few ways to donate to help
praetor Rico hurricane victims more
money Oh money more money than cash
money we give ok a really quick letter
um a bit with kayo my name's Omar and I
am newer about six months fan of you and
Paul
I saw the stream last Tuesday September
12th my condolences and I was going to
send you some craft beer from here in
Erie Pennsylvania huh but apparently
Pennsylvania does not allow alcohol
shipping ha ooh so I saw the part where
you requested spicy and my trigger
finger snap into action you should be
receiving two extremely hot lollipops
within the next day or two one for you
and one Paul I do have to warn you it's
like 9 million Scoville
they also sneekly just smell like
cinnamon anywho hope you enjoy them
hopefully on stream I did the five
minute challenge with these but failed
miserably so good luck to you both and
the way he saw sincerely Omar TPS I
could not donate on stream so here you
go thank you very much Omar Omar 3 very
much Omar absolutely I'm about to hate
you a lot ours is that maggot with us
I'm thinking maybe this is it let's see
it's gotta be this one because that's
just glass so go ahead and nations here
alright
Timothy Bilson $10 thank you - is a damn
dirty cheater you're damn Skippy yeah oh
yeah we have to touch him J and figure
out how that went down
alright hopefully we can start watching
that one soon the J and Dmitry won right
on scrap yard Wars
yeah the right eunuch $13 I'm donating
but I have a question cannot seem to get
past 20 666 on the Trident Z 3200 with
an R 5 1600 Strix be 350 it will default
to 2100 will run a day then crash and
reboot then defaults again bios Utd BIOS
is updated I'm guesses what what are you
saying
now these are over clock speeds so
you're not guaranteed to be able to get
3200 but not being able to get past 20
666 especially with some decent tread at
Z 3200 speed RAM does seem a little bit
sketchy so I would question whether you
are if you are you trying to use XMP
values of that kind of thing you're
actually going in and punching in all
the values directly are you updating
your voltage Ram voltage will default to
1.2 volts I believe with Rison and you
might need to go in and manually set it
1.35 that's a big thing there and all I
can think of off the top of my head
but I hope I hope some of those
suggestions help good lord this looks
this sounds terrified is actually it
it's called two lollipops like god
they're caught it's called the toe of
Satan oh no that didn't it's got like a
devil on it and this this is 9 million
Scoville unit chilli extract guaranteed
to scorch any mortals tongue can you
survive five whole minutes of intense
heat no I already know I can't do this I
like spicy food a lot but this is this
is like stupid spicy this isn't even
like enjoyable spice

and this is lit this is one of the
things that like not even one of those
things that be like oh it's funny or
whatever like that I would I would die I
would vomit everywhere I'd be like bye
guys and I'd leave and I'd stop I
probably wouldn't talk to Kyle for like
a merlot crackers it's just maybe the
reminder of it is like that I'd be
willing I'd be willing to like lick it
I'd probably lick it and then have like
a gallon of milk on standby hmm but
maybe we should save this for maybe we
let's save this for next week's faceoff
if we do a face-off we can do a
punishment
we're like the loser only has like
licking like like why wait I will not be
putting it's not even a link no I will
not put it in your mouth no even though
you knew our very own creating them
anywhere near my mouth my mouth is made
beautiful stop even opening them that's
dangerous okay my god burns my eye
all right nucking futs $5 thank you I've
been watching all the oKed episodes and
skits on new ITV from the beginning
what's your favorite that stands out
here's five dollars for the wife that
from the wife's IKEA fund uh favorite
band out there was a some of the earlier
episodes when we first kind of started
to get into the rhythm of it because
there were there was a few there were a
few missteps early on before the show
the show really can't took shape into
what it became right like at one point I
decided that like this is this is my
decision and I'll completely admit was
wrong it we did this completely other
thing I was like let's just make that
the oaked episode this week and it was
it was a bad idea but it was it was all
trial by fire I would have ideas that we
try out it was just like that bombed I
want to say episode like six or seven or
something like that was when Kyle and I
first actually got behind the desk
because for the first few episodes
anchor style yeah because it wasn't
until seven or eight or an episode seven
eight or nine that we actually both were
behind the desk and yeah is the
whatever watch what self yoke doesn't
feel like is good wasn't really solid
like we started to get our groove I
think the pirate episode is always a
favorite of mine yeah and what else I
mean we had there are some other random
ones in there that were fun but it's
hard to remember like there were little
random things that we did here and there
that's right stand out but I can't I
can't put them - there was so that I
think Joanne and I were the main hosts
and we kind of covered the evolution of
yoke like from the start to the finish
oh yeah that was like wait around maybe
was episode 50 or something like that
but that was fun that's good good times
Thank You nucking futs deserve a $50
help for those in need

also looking to play with our fancy toys

mention of this on my happen to be
completely reserved alright mr. Steven
Lloyd $10 australian love the show just
wanted to know what a decent gaming
monitor is for a budget decent gaming
monitor for a budget know off the top of
your head something that's like 60 Hertz
yeah with freesync probably say that's
pretty you can get a decent freesync
monitor for like under 200 bucks no
problem make sure that it's IPS I would
suggest IPS freesync
24 to 27 inches would be pretty sweet
and you're probably gonna need to spend
150 to 200 ish dollars for that you can
get not like there's like a budget
budget options options in $100 range for
like 1080 but um it's it's nice to jump
up to some of those higher specs for
sure yeah and sorry we don't know any
specific model numbers alright Gareth
bundle $10 British sterling pounds just
want to say thank you both you guys
you're awesome have helped me build my
system 59 30k at four points of
Rocksteady Vega 56 OC - 1673 megahertz
you actually have a Vega 56 it's amazing
on a custom loop drin stream late WTF is
with the lipstick that was so Kyle's
disappearance completed to make it the
punishment for face off we played face
off it was very very fair matchup and I
lost so
Matt $20 Canadian hey guys love the show
currently running at 4790k
4.8 gigahertz eight gigs of G still
trying to 2400 MSI r9 390x ocz vertex
force 240 gig thousand watt power supply
etc only uses for gaming I'd like your
advice on what's upgrade for quad HD
gaming quad HD so Q HD is - tuna - yeah
vibrate at twenty five six to the
fourteen forty I would say your CPUs
fine your GPU is perfectly adequate - I
mean you got a 390 X that's not terrible
if you really wanted to upgrade right
now with the market like it isn't
everything then maybe consider at ten
seventy that would be a decent bump up
for me to 390x even at 1080 what also be
something to consider or hey maybe
there's a 1070 TI coming soon that you
could invest in as well but thank you
Matt for the donation rock when we got
there this letter was basically an ad
okay I can't read all right there you go
Robert F $5 make it ran for Paul
make it rain Robert thank you for that
Felix Montelongo $15 great contact keep
it up which is better for cooling at
1700 X a be quiet dark pro 3 or an X
Noctua
D 15 my historical experience tells me
the Noctua n HD 15 would be a little bit
better performance wise overall against
the what against the dart be quiet dark
I believe the dark rock pro 3 but I
can't say it cool I can't fit I've
paired those directly against each other
so it would probably be a situation
where it's not much of a difference or
an advantage my nose is like a we are
running from the heat
he's still gone and literally just like
little couple like little licks and
stuff like in there I mean it's okay
okay we got a clip of me kissing you oh

even though it's not that much like they
they make your screen like almost
undoable and you can't you can't look at

that's something I can kind of see my
screen your screen light goes away like
you can't see anything they're

Sabanci piece is about pcs apparently
makes that thank you Caleb John Doe five
dollar donation no comment take you John

this is completely platonic don't smile
don't smile Jeremiah chastened world 10
dollars Australian just for the kiss
lol thank you chase Georgio oriani 5
pounds for Puerto Rico do you think a
1080 I can run the new 200 Hertz ultra
whites coming out later this year
beginning of next year well honestly
Georgie ah no or Georgie oh I'm sorry
it's the best option you have right now
outside of a Titan XP so I hope so if
not there will probably be a new
graphics cards next year that have a
better shot at that but turn it hurts
ultra wide it's gonna be probably a
matter of turning down some settings and
specific games depending on the game
you're playing and that kind of thing
alright last donation Adam kabosh $5
hope this helps up a good cause trying
to build a new PC with used parts or
some good used CPU options for around
100 USD on Craigslist I can't say
specifically for that price but what I
will say is look for regeneration look
for parts that are maybe like getting to
be about one to two maybe three years
max old there's a lot of people who like
to keep up with the newest stuff so
anytime there
hardware gets to be one or two years old
they'll sell it off in order to fund
their newest stuff and that's freaking
off and find some good deals on parts
that are still not too updated so that
would mean for right now you probably
looking like skylake stuff if you're
looking at the Intel side yeah don't
bother buying old AMD stuff you want
Rison or newer for that which is current
current pop all right we have one more
final 10 $100 donation from ZZR hardy
it's 100 hundred Australian Aussies
which I would assume was also just just
double-checking that we went through
with with the promise there and also
probably double checking that cattle is
actually gonna match up to $500

close to thanks thanks to all you guys
