to you by fractal design MSI and cable
modern check out the links in the
description below or you'll wake up next
to me tomorrow morning alright guys
we're here at the corsair booth now and
they're showing off a brand new keyboard
this is the k 95 Platinum mu using some
MX speed switches
I do believe let's take a closer look
there yep
that's that's totally speed switch I
just knew it I just knew it from from
touching it totally so the the newest
thing about this and I think probably
the most visible is the light bar that
you see right here going all the way
down the entire keyboard there's
actually 19 different zones you can
completely configure this just like you
can with any of the other RGB LEDs to
pretty much do any kind of effect that
you might imagine so that's pretty cool
the other cool thing about this board is
that they've brought back the USB 2.0
pass-through right on the back here so
that's one thing that the community
really wanted back in the game so
Corsair has brought it back to you guys
also it's got eight megabytes of onboard
memory so you can store up to three
profiles and pretty much take the
keyboard wherever you want with you and
never have to worry about your profiles
not being left behind I should say
there's also a button right here where
you can switch on the fly between those
three profiles at any time regardless of
where you might be gaining from and the
last big update to this keyboard is that
the wrist rest is now featuring two
different textures you've got kind of
like a smooth texture right here it is
completely magnetic so you can just pop
it out like so flip it around and now
you've got a completely different
texture because everyone has their
preference on what kind of surface they
want their wrists to be resting on so
MSRP on this bad boy is $1.99 I believe
and availability is going to be
what's that q1 q1 q1 thank you very much
q1 availability availability so stay
tuned for this coming very soon it's
pretty exciting let's go ahead and see
what else they got here Hey look they
chopped off half the macro Peas alright
so by now you guys are probably familiar
with coursers and vengeance led series
Ram very popular very beautiful looking
stuff now they've pretty much taken the
same thing and made it RGB compatible so
you pretty much get the full gamut of
color spectrum that you would expect
from an RGB device these days and I
think I do think that they look a little
bit brighter and I was asking them about
that
they've actually done some refinements
to the PCB itself to be able to deliver
more power to the LEDs and that's why
they are a bit more bright and vibrant
than the the Vengeance LEDs series which
is pretty cool this also comes along
with some software in Corsair link now
this is a beta software so don't take
everything you see here with a grain of
salt there are some features that are
not available yet but this is a pretty
cool software from what they've shown me
so far you can actually synchronize all
of the LEDs on each of the modules or
you can have them run separately and
have their own profiles you can group
them together or not there's the kind of
more what you would expect as far as
like LED effects including like the
rainbow effect you know rainbow wave
color spectrum pulse breathing and all
that sort of thing you can also change
the plateau or the slope also there's on
some onboard storage believe it or not
on these modules so even if you were to
configure an LED profile on this kit and
take them out of one computer and put
them in another one even if that
computer didn't have Corsair link it
would still boot up with the same color
profile that you would set on the on
your first rig so that's pretty cool
actually um as far as MSRP goes they did
not say but these should be available
relatively soon so stay tuned for that
hey look it's the MP 500 nvme SSD aimed
to drive that we Paul and I talked about
an awesome hardware cool alright guys
that is gonna wrap it up for the Corsair
booth here at CES 2017 thank you guys so
much for tuning in be sure to stay tuned
for more CES coverage coming at you
really soon
