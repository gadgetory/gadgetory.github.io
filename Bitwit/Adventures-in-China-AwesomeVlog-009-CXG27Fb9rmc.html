Chinese airport and there's Rachel
it was a long 14-hour flight but we got
through it all right Rachel looks
stunning as always
it's so difficult we staying beautiful
on these long flights it's so damn humid
right now that even our bags are just
wet from condensation mines
I thought someone peed on my bag oh wait
no nevermind that's just the terminal
waiting full of our cab driver who's
supposed to meet us here well I guess
he's not a cab driver he probably has
like a his own car
he's a chauffeur he's a fancy so we've
just arrived at our hotel it's the bow
Ling lang I don't know I don't really
know how to pronounce it I just know
it's such a bow it ends with Ling lang
lang
he always tell it's a nice hotel when
they have chandeliers in the lobby all
right we're in the hotel room or I
should say I'm in the hotel room we each
got our own rooms which is awesome I'm
gonna give you guys a little tour let's
go into the bathroom first there's me I
just took a shower so yeah I was feeling
pretty grimy after 14 hours of being in
a plane so here's the toilet it's got
its own little little door here so you
could totally hotbox while you're taking
a poop and of course there's a phone in
case you're in a toilet paper some other
dire emergency shower right here share
is actually really nice I had a good
time in you basically very spacious it's
got a few settings on the showerhead
which is always gold over here is the is
the toiletry section with the sink and
you know it's kind of funny is that they
have these complementary directs
products which I thought was quite
flattering that they the China thinks
that I'm gonna get some on this trip but
I think this is more likely my my option
here complimentary water as well which
is cool and that's so and in a very nice
bathtub which I don't know if I'm going
to use this so now I'm not
huge bath person I don't know
doot-doot-doot many guys take baths I
know I know girls do but I don't know
maybe I will just because I have my own
room this time I should take advantage
of all the amenities that at the hotel
room has here all right let's check out
the rest of the room so over here let's
take a pit stop here this closet I've
got a couple robes
I'm blights turn on automatically very
nice we have a safe lock box store all
your valuables key code entry this is
kind of interesting this is a
self-contained air mask airline mask and
look at that that's a full head helmet
it says it's a fire escape hood which
also happens to be extremely useful for
traveling to outer space here we have
two beds and I've already checked they
can be moved so you bet I will be
combining the two of them to make one
giant a super bed which I will take full
advantage of I've got a TV here this
looks to be maybe a 42 inch it's not a
terrible TV it's a cone Cup conka-chonk
a-- must be a Chinese brand I was
expecting to see a Qiang Hong TV in here
but no it was all my stuff bunch of crap
I've already somewhat started to make
myself at home this is all my vape stuff
for my electronic cigarette I've got a
little bit of a kit here going on get my
batteries and drip tips different
atomizers mods all the tools for
building coils some juice this is the
desk that I'll be working at at least
for the next couple of days so what's
happening is we're staying in China me
Rachel hoon and mr. Lam are staying in
China for the next three or four days to
cover an LED factory which I will be
doing the hosting on that one and after
that we're gonna be flying to Taiwan for
seven days to cover Computex but after
after China my lead role on this trip is
an editor so I'll be editing videos with
this laptop here that we usually bring
to our events this is a GT 70 from MSI
it's basically a gaming laptop high-end
gaming laptop but it works great for
editing as well it's still rock in
Windows 7 at the moment and the mouse
I'm using is I think this is a TT
eSports Theron
it's an infrared mouse it's got a bunch
of customisable profile you can adjust
the polling rate
you know adjustable weights and things
of that sort I've actually never used
this mouse it was just lying around the
new ITV studio so I just picked it up
threw it in the bag
hopefully it'll it'll get the job done
and I don't know if you guys can really
get a feel from this video of how big
this hotel room really is I mean I've
got a couch that's like you could fit
like two people comfortably on there
it's very homey and very spacious so
here's another shot of the room just
panning suite a nice big mirror hello
and I guess this is the last thing I'll
show you guys is the view whoa so bright
by the way it's probably around 89
degrees right now which doesn't sound
too hot but the humidity factor adds 10
to 15 degrees to that so the weather
actually feels a lot hotter than it
really is and I mean once you step
outside it's it's pretty much like
Taiwan maybe even a little bit worse in
terms of humidity and just how much
you're gonna sweat just because it's a
little bit more south closer to the
coast so we are eating Japanese food in
China this is an authentic Japanese
restaurant so we got to take our shoes
off and then it looks like everybody
eats on the floor as well you can see
there are no cares just the floor all
right so we're just getting started here
the Japanese restaurant and drink a
little bit of sake taking it really easy
not didn't want to go too far we don't
want to indulge ourselves so we're
really just pacing ourselves oh my god
oh oh my god that's a huge bottle of
sake go ahead and pick that up and let
me get a frame of reference here yeah
it's gonna be a good night
yeah how big these beans are yeah yeah
that big beat anybody came about the
same factory is that sock a bottle
hey guys we've just arrived at the
Shenzhen Airport which is actually a
massive building shaped like an airplane
incorrect it's supposed to be a Manor a
it just looks really cool in here the
ceiling is extremely high and there's a
million holes in its letting light
through it's a really nice Airport so I
just thought I would end this little
vlog here before we head over to Taiwan
for Computex thank you guys for joining
me on this stay tuned for part 2 coming
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
