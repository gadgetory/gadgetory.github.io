ant-man tonight I mean obviously the
movies gonna butcher the original
storyline but come on he's like the most
underrated character in the Marvel
Universe screw ant-man man let's go to
Vegas the venturi fans from fractal
design make everything cooler that's
right even you check the link in the
description boy what's up guys so
generally speaking there's nothing more
important in a PC than its raw
performance and functionality after all
what good is a computer if it can't
effectively do the things you need it to
but once you've got yourself a fully
functional desktop the next thing you
might consider is aesthetics so for
those of you rocking a chassis with a
side panel window today I'll be taking a
look at these new alchemy 2.0 magnetic
LED strips from BitFenix which can
really give your rig that exotic accent
it deserves
oh-ho-ho-ho whee Oh wrong accent now
most of us by now are familiar with the
brand's older strips that used an
adhesive backing to cling to the innards
of your case but if you've ever used
them firsthand chances are you've
experienced issues with the adhesive
weakening over time causing them to peel
off slightly or fall off entirely there
was also no good way to remove and
reinstall the strip in a different case
without ruining the adhesive properties
and leaving behind that sticky residue
the alchemy 2.0 version aims to overcome
these obstacles by replacing the
adhesive with a magnetic solution a
seemingly minor revision that yields big
improvements for the strip's ease of use
apart from that there's also been a
slight change of color options from the
original alchemy line while you still
get your choice of red blue green or
white the orange that's available in the
adhesive version has been replaced in
the magnetic lineup with purple damn I
was hoping that they would opt for a
pink LED strip to match my custom
water-cooled build I'm sick of buying
pink LEDs from China only to find that
they're not actually pink and that they
smell like child labor
I think these dried tears are what's
dulling the colour
oh the strips come in three varying
lengths including twelve thirty and
sixty centimeters and all strips feature
a 50 centimeter molex power cable which
can be daisy chained for comfortable
cable routing in even the most cavernous
of cases the LED strips themselves can
also be daisy chained with the included
connector allowing you to link up to
four strips on a single power cable for
maximum coverage as you can see here the
magnetic strip grips the insides of your
steel case with ease though obviously
you won't get the same effect if you're
dealing with an aluminum chassis but
don't worry Lee Ann Lee and in Wynne
case owners the fact that you own a case
from either of those vendors means
you're already used to having limited
functionality in addition to lining the
LED strips with magnets BitFenix has
also included a magnet at the end of the
power cable for tidier cabling and to
keep its weight from pulling the strip
off of its surface so based on
everything we've seen so far these are
clearly some of the nicest LED strips
out there but perhaps the biggest factor
when it comes to accent lighting is how
good it looks so here's a quick montage
of all the colors powered on inside of
my define r5 build some words that come
to mind are deep rich bright vibrant
holy crap the white LEDs are bright pure
majestic so yeah the colors look awesome
and they appear to be very accurate
although BitFenix claims they're green
LEDs to have been adjusted to match the
popular NVIDIA green and I have to say
they look more akin to a traditional
leprechaun green than the yellowish
green hue typically found on a reference
GeForce card overall though I am pretty
impressed with this new line of alchemy
strips and I do appreciate the added
flexibility that they offer when adding
some bling to an otherwise dull system
boo that is gonna do it for now guys let
me know what you think of these LEDs in
the comments below and feel free to toss
me a like on this video if you enjoyed
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
