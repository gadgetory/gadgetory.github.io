doing well I am in Las Vegas Nevada here
for CES 2018 but actually drove out here
with whyphy sauce she's getting ready in
the room so if you hear any ambient
noise and it's distracting that's her
fault but we drove out here a few days
early to attend AMD CES tech Day 2018
where they shared a lot of information
about their upcoming products for this
year it's very exciting stuff there's a
lot of info so I've tried to trim as
much fat as possible just to curate all
the information that I figured you guys
would be most curious about so just
let's just start off with the 2018
rollout plans
Rison desktop and mobile AP users are
expected to arrive q1 with second gen
rise and desktop processors and rise in
pro mobile ap use following in q2 and
then finally we're gonna see second gen
thread Ripper and second gen rise in pro
desktop CPUs in the second half of the
year and we'll touch on each of these
more specifically apart from second gen
rising thread Ripper they didn't really
talk much at all about that other than
it's coming soon so I'm gonna start off
with all of the Mobile announcements
first and then we'll work our way over
to desktop by the end of the video so
starting with Radeon Vega mobile
processors those are going to be coming
soon they're gonna be featuring HBM 2
and they're gonna be super low powered
very small footprint they're gonna have
a very short Z height as well 1.7
millimeters that's almost half of what
we saw with discrete Vega meaning that
they're gonna be able to fit into
slimmer and more ultra portable laptops
and notebooks and things like that of
course you know low power means less
heat as well we already they are capable
we should be able to see some of these
notebooks be able to drive pretty nice
VR experiences whether it be you know
oculus rift or the HTC vive 300
certified freesync displays to choose
from we should be seeing more freesync
two monitors become widely available in
2018 Radeon will support HDMI 2.1 so
we'll be able to get a nice variable
refresh rate technology out of our Vega
mobile processors and unfortunately
there was no word of any desktop Vega
being fit into mobile devices so it
looks like for the foreseeable future if
you want super high-end mobile get
graphics performance then you would
still be going with team green for now
but mobile Vega is at the very least
going to offer much lower cost and less
power consumption and heat as well
moving on to rise in mobile ap use they
didn't really save or throw around the
acronym APU very much they would just
say rising mobile processors with Radeon
Vega graphics but for just the sake of
convenience I'm just gonna call them ap
use whether they like it or not so we
saw the risin 5 2400 you launched late
last year just in December and it had
pretty nice gaming performance
especially compared to the Intel
integrated graphics and we have even
more rise in mobile ap use to follow for
this year starting with the risin 320
200 you there's gonna be a 2 core 4
thread part with a base clock of 2.5
gigahertz and a max boost of 3.43
compute units a max GPU clock of 1,000
megahertz 5 megabytes of l2 and l3
combined cache and a 15 watt TDP just
for the record all of these chips that
I'm about to list off here have a TDP of
15 watts so I have to keep repeating
that rise in 320 300 you is gonna have
four cores and four threads we're gonna
see a basin boost of two gigahertz and
3.4 gigahertz respectively 6 C use max
GPU clock of eleven hundred megahertz
six megabytes of l2 l3 cache and we did
see a demo of that chip running
Wolfenstein 2 at 1920 by 1080 on an HP
Envy 360 notebook again it's a 15 watt
notebook it looked really fluid from you
know what I could see from from my seat
looking at the giant projector and this
is again with no discrete GPU this is
all off of the integrated Vega graphics
on on these new ap use which is pretty
impressive the risin 5 2500 you is gonna
have 4 cores and 8 threads with a base
and boost of 2.0 gigahertz and 3.6
gigahertz respectively
we have 8c use a max GPU clock of eleven
hundred megahertz six megabytes of l2 l3
cache and then finally we have the Rison
seven 2700 you this appears to be their
flagship mobile apu with four cores and
eight threads so we are getting some
multi-threaded action there base clock
of 2.2 gigahertz with a max boost of 3.8
10 C use the max GPU clock of 1,300
megahertz and 6 megabytes of cache this
falls slightly behind the core i7 8550
you in single threaded Cinebench but
soars ahead as you can see here in the
multi-threaded test in fact it's
actually getting
same multi-threading performance as the
cry 5 7600 K which is of course a
desktop chip so that's pretty impressive
and this of course is gonna be using
infinity fabric to sort of bind Xen and
Vega together it's gonna act as the
singular backbone of the apu governing
the entire SOC all the elements on the
chip will be serviced through infinity
fabric which is also what's going to be
managing precision boost to and mobile
exif are and as you might expect we're
going to see these chips become
available in a wide variety of
two-in-ones
ultra fins and gaming laptops of course
Rison pro mobile these are also going to
be featuring the Radeon Vega graphics so
these are essentially just the pro
versions of the aps we just talked about
these are really aimed at the enterprise
and commercial markets that are looking
for a silicon level security and various
features that you know enhance
enterprise class support and things like
that
the three skis that were mentioned here
are the resin three pro 2300 you rise in
five pro 2500 you and the rise in 7 pro
2700 you these will be made available
with a wide range of enterprise ultra
portable and workstation laptops come q2
of this year and then moving on to our
desktop stuff this is this is what gets
me excited first off we've got rise in
desktop AP use alright launching
February 12th that's right around the
corner these are gonna be great for low
cost low power small form-factor systems
HT pcs ultra portable gaming rigs you
name it so these are gonna be pretty
exciting Rison 520 400 G is gonna have
four cores and eight threads we have a
base in max boost clock of 3.6 and 3.9
gigahertz respectively 11 C use max GPU
clock of twelve hundred and fifty
megahertz six megabytes of l2 l3 cache
up to a 65 watt TDP and a price of 169
US dollars very attractive this doubles
the graphics performance of the core i5
8400 in time spy also matches the
performance of an eighty four hundred
and a GT 1030 which is of course a
discrete GPU and that is to say that
you're getting about the same
performance as something that has a
higher TDP and is gonna cost you quite a
bit more
the only other ski when this family was
the Rison 320 200
g4 core for thread part base clock of
3.5 and a max boost of 3.7 gigahertz 8c
use a max GPU clock of 1,100 megahertz
and six megabytes of l2 l3 cache once
again up to a 65 watt TDP retailing for
$99 pretty awesome now personally I
think the most exciting thing about
these APU is is that they're fully
unlocked which means the CPU clock the
GPU clock and of course the DRAM can all
be overclocked and in AMD's testing you
know with the help of infinity fabric
and all that overclocking all three of
those elements they were able to see a
39 percent uplift in 3d mark firestrike
39 percent that's crazy
they even had some fun just for the
walls and they tried overclocking it
with ln2
Ellen 2 overclocking on an APU and the
GPU clock actually hit 2 gigahertz which
is freaking insane so there's gonna be
all these things are gonna be a lot of
fun to play with I can't wait to get my
hands on them for testing and it
definitely sounds promising for gamers
who are on a more you know conservative
budget or if you're just looking for
something like an HTPC breast assure
there will be many builds with these AP
use at least on this channel finally
let's talk about those second gen rise
in desktop CPUs these are the
full-fledged
successors to the you know the 1000
series CPUs that did so well upon their
launch last year no models
specifications or pricing was mentioned
at the tech day so I don't have any of
that for you guys and that's gonna come
later but there's still some juicy
details here the 2000 series roadmap for
this year is gonna look pretty similar
as it did last year with Verizon 7
coming out first followed by Rison 5 but
then we've got the AP use in the desktop
family now so we've got the Rison 5 AP
use launching right after and then we
have Rison 3 desktop and then rise in 3
AP use to follow so it's gonna be a
pretty intense line up of launches this
year if you thought last year was crazy
AMD just seems to like not be slowing
down their momentum at all these second
gen rising desktop CPUs are of course
going to be the first to use the 12
nanometers n plus core again with Zen 2
and Zen 3 to follow later on we're gonna
be seeing higher clock speeds with the
second generation of CPUs which is
exciting that was one area where Intel
just sort of demolished their
competition with the
able to hit you know upwards of five 5.1
5.2 gigahertz with AMD still you know
rising struggling to hit four gigahertz
sometimes so that's gonna be really nice
AMD also mentioned their precision boost
to technology so that's gonna be coming
back but even better than ever more
optimized in ways that I'm not going to
get into detail right now just to keep
the video of it shorter we also got
confirmation that all the
second-generation
rise in desktop CPUs will be compatible
with existing am4 motherboards so that
includes you know the X 370 chipset
boards and be 350 chips at boards all
you'll need is a BIOS update from your
motherboard manufacturer in order to
make that all work but that's nice and
in conversely you could even slot 1000
series CPUs into newer am4 motherboards
when they roll out later this year
that's gonna include boards on the X 470
chipset that's the brand new one that's
gonna have some nice features that they
didn't really get into exactly what
features that chip that's gonna come
with and there was also no mention of
potentially cheaper be for 50 boards but
I would have to imagine that those are
also gonna be coming soon as for the X
470 boards those are gonna be arriving
the same time as the second-generation
desktop CPUs in April of 2018 and last
but not least AMD was very proud to
announce their Wraith prism because more
RGB is how they phrased it this is of
course gonna feature per LED color
control around the ring illuminated fan
blades enhanced motherboard
compatibility and there's even a dark
mode for all of you RGB heathens out
there also kind of convenient is a
switchable OC fan profile and they're
assuring us that it's gonna be operating
very quietly like we've seen with all
the other Wraith coolers so those are
pretty much all the highlights that I
wanted to share with you guys in a
nutshell if you guys want some more
information maybe Paul from Paul's
hardware has also uploaded a video go
ahead and check that out if he has I'll
put a link in the description below he
may have done a deeper dive than I have
or all the other tech journalists out
there who were at the event go ahead and
check those out too this is really
exciting stuff though AMD has a lot of
things on the horizon and you know I
think Intel's gonna have their work cut
out for them just as much this year if
not more so than they did in 2017 and of
course more competition is always good
for consumers at the end of the day on a
final note be sure to stay subscribed or
get subscribed if you're not already so
you don't miss any of the CES cover
CES starts in two days so I'll be
pumping out a lot dozens of videos or at
least at least a dozen a dozen or so
videos of the events so it should be
very exciting as well to see what all
the other vendors apart from AMD are
gonna be coming out with later this year
but guys thanks so much for watching
stay tuned for more coming soon and I
will see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
