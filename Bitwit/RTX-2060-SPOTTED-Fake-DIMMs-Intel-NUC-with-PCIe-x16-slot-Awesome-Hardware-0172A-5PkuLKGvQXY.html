right and anyway we just don't like to
YouTube so there's none there's nothing
we can do about it whoa
people saying I am glitching if you look
at xsplit it looks like I'm glitching
like every couple seconds yeah that's
what people are saying in chat - oh
that's why they're saying I'm a hologram
well you know what I've always wanted to
be a hologram I wanted to be a hologram
for Halloween and I couldn't find a
great costume for it so now I get to
live that dream just happy I don't know
it's not happening to me
that's why maybe I am I've just been
turned into a hologram it's so strange I
feel like I'm like the bull kid from
Willy Wonka who might people might find
out that that I'm not real that Wendell
help develop for Paul to host a live
show that way you can collect both of
both your and my donation amounts
all right well is it gonna do that the
whole stream probably I don't know
that's never happened before and I don't
understand why it's only happening to me
why are you glitch free alts glitch
proof
I am glitch prone I was born with this
condition are we streaming to you to
YouTube no - we are right hi YouTube hey
YouTube you guys can probably see us
glitching - then or meet glitching right
yep I see I see me glitching on on the
YouTube player that is so weird
hey you know what every everything has a
remix these days including me
alright its 2018 get used to it people
[Laughter]
alright alright I'm gonna hear still
that whole time
RTX off yeah but the performance is
great now is
there's nothing I can do
we just streamed the taller livestream I
had everything completely reconfigured
in here I barely got everything put back
together to where it is right now so
things might be a little wonky true
comes down to true for that we're just
gonna have to the show must go on people
if you know if it really bothers you
then take a post-it note and put it
right over me so that you could only see
Paul yeah at least you'll be able to
hear the sound of my voice hopefully my
voice isn't glitching I don't think
that's happening so but let's let's move
on because we've got a lot to talk about
today for starters we are a tech news
show sort of we are professionals oh
yeah that's streaming and we do the show
every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time right here on twitch.tv
slash awesome hard right hardware we
also stream late that would probably
help me to was that yeah 26 TV pad that
was on okay how's that guys can you hear
me now oh you weren't even your mic
wasn't even enabled no it's a just a
boost it's one of those audio soundboard
things you can do if it's a really hot
input you can you can put that on so
push the button
push the button and fixed it and a
button button hey I can getting slightly
better at using the sound board it's a
work in progress so anyway we also
stream this in two halves on our
respective YouTube channels today the
first half is clearly on my channel
youtube.com slash bit wit and in about
half an hour to 40 minutes or so you can
hop over to Paul's channel to catch side
B that's youtube.com slash Klaus
hardware you can also find a link to his
channel in my video description we also
like to have a drink or two on the show
usually an alcoholic beverage of some
sort to choose to all of you who are
joining us either on the stream or
drinking at home we will occasionally
use foul language adult language so
explicit language warning potentially we
don't we don't go over the top of it
it's not gratuitous or anything but okay
tasteful an F word will Simona only when
appropriate only one appropriate and
also we sell things on our stores we
have two stores - bit with tech / store
or just bit with tech it'll bring you
right to my store page where you can buy
the new 8bitboy blaster gaming mouse
pads there's also the RGB everything
series of merchandise we also have a
very nice new fan made design which is
kind of an exploded view of exploded /
cartoony view of of a computer I really
like that you can see Paul and I just
chilling on a radiator there that's
spitting its tongue out we saw someone
at the recent fan meet wearing one of
these shirts and they looked really good
look really really good by the way the
awesome hardware stuff you can buy from
either store doesn't matter either way
we share the profits yeah and if you're
looking at anything some hardware stuff
and you don't see it in stock in your
size shape or variety in one store you
can check the other one because right
you know stock levels fluctuate and
everything and we still have holiday
sales really going on so if you buy $50
or more spend $50 or more you get 10%
off if you spend 100 bucks or more 20%
off so quite a savings more you buy the
more you save you can also get gift
cards now - gift cards to buy gift card
Paul store is Paul's hardware net
forever he sells a smorgasbord of
delectable items as well including your
new olive green t-shirt with a
thumbscrew logo no yeah like that very
much
there's Heather Heather olive green yes
Heather slave-labor is still continuing
maybe hashtag free Heather we had to
live long
more Heather she she makes an honest
living that way but yeah we'll yell jobs
in that she at the end of the show if
you happen to buy anything from us and
thank you for supporting the channel in
advance we also had a really successful
12 hour livestream for charity just on
this last Saturday Thanks to everyone
who was a part of it
and we raised a butt ton of money yeah
for the Children's Hospital Los Angeles
Children's Hospital of Los Angeles made
out pretty phat I think we raised over
$20,000 or something like that yeah and
we just totaled up the super chats just
today they're gonna pass
get 4x4 I think or something like that I
would expect nothing less
so 20 grand I imagine that's what it
goes towards that's that was our intent
the supercar but so this is this this is
a maid who made this oh my so my
brother-in-law who's also whose name is
also Kyle we call him 2.0 Kyle 2.0 his
friend who I've met like once maybe
twice was apparently watching our stream
and made this chart for us documenting
the progress of our whole stream for the
full 12 hours with game changes you can
see how long we played each game and
also the donation amounts what they were
at those various periods yeah so it's
it's actually pretty cool to see how
much we love csgo and and mario kart
apparently and just and just how much
you guys this is the longest amount of
time played on the same game yes and
also just how much we raised in like the
first hour - you also say also not this
period of time between when the stream
started and when we actually started
playing games yeah it ramped up really
quick and so we eventually hit well over
20 20 K plus our super chats I think
Paul's ears were like 1,100 or something
like that yeah yeah so we we now have
the super chat numbers as well that we
can add to that so I was half of my mind
was like 1,300 about 11 1100 added
through my super chat yeah so overall
we're liking the to 2,200 to 2,300 no
28,000 to 23,000 range yeah 173 dollars
and six cents to be in my super Chen
donation yeah and to answer your
question check yes we did try csgo
battle royale and we did not like it
yeah it was stupid
very boring regular CS goes much better
alright so thanks again for everyone who
contributed there let's move on to hot
and heavy hardware yeah that's my first
segment for today that's where most of
our news will come from at least on my
half so first off we've got an article
grip what oh Jesus what this is the
technical difficulty episode you know
you think my episode 172 we do hang of
this I need to have taped I need a
update several things with this no
variation it's right now it's totally
cool we have it under control
you keep glitching it I don't I don't
know wait so what would happen you think
what happens if yeah what happens if you
come over here Paul just just first I
can entertain
here primeira notification yeah okay no
it's literally only it's a more
glitching on my half so it's really just
my half of the why I don't know why oh
sorry
are you still well I guess you're
peeking you're peeking a bit sorry
mm-hmm I'm maxing compressor max
compressor for Kyle I can whisper if you
want it'll just be a really creepy show
what are you talking about news
videocards calm they have their own
sources they're their sources have
confirmed that's an RT x 26 t launch is
imminent
perhaps sometime in early 2019 and it's
gonna have a tu 106 GPU with 1920 cuda
cores it seems like a lot of people are
saying that that's that's actually more
CUDA cuda cores than they expected along
with 6 gigs of Gd are 6 6 gigs for any
gamer who's buying in RTX 2060 should be
plenty it's the ideal amount of gddr3 is
6 gigs 6 gigs 26 is pictured model is a
gigabyte factory overclocked card we are
not sure of the clock speeds yet and it
has a dual fan cooler of course and it
looks relatively compact looks like a
pretty average length card I would say
we're speculating around nine nine and a
half inches or so that's what she said
it has a single 8 pin power connector
the reference card is believed to only
have a 6 pin but because of the fact we
overclock here that's why we're probably
getting those extra 2 pins there's a
Rhodes also speculation that performance
here will be somewhat akin to a gtx 1070
or perhaps even a gtx 1070 TI depending
and pricing remains to be seen of course
with with gtx 1070 s currently going for
around I'm not sure one thing ok just a
lot of trouble just gonna plug the HDMI
unplug it back in okay prepare to be
blind for a second channel find are like
two seconds but oh there it goes oh
you're using the elgato yeah do you
usually use the old got though it's been
switching back and forth ok is it back
no yeah there it is
it's back
they still itching I am still glitching
you're still glitching yeah all right
well let's maybe a little less light but
it might pick up again it's just little
random glitches glitches be tripping I
have no clue I think it's the capture
card it's maybe maybe it's the 59.9 and
seven or dot nine three or whatever
instead of 60fps I don't know George
it's just the matrix or something all
right
so RT X 2060 any thoughts Paul on that I
was expecting this to happen yeah yeah I
think we all were I reserve judgment
until we find out what it costs yes
exactly
his T V deep because they can easily
destroy anyone's interest in this by
being thinking it's only four hundred
and fifty dollars you know once you go
over to two hundred and fifty dollars
maybe even three hundred it's all
invidious game it's all in videos it's
all Nvidia market share so six is sixty
four for four hundred US dollars
all right choice especially shorten it
use a free sink now that is true that is
true I take that back
but it'll be interesting to see how this
competes within our X Mega 56 guys I
don't think it's the sensor or the
camera itself because when I was looking
at the camera monitor just now it was
just fine so sound of a glitch all right
let's move on to our next story here
from WCC of tech about the z3 90 horas
extreme water force motherboard that's
just been unveiled my my is it glorious
look at it just look at it
feast your eyes on on this beauty of
cooling and power thing it's a thing
that big s one of the biggest monoblocks
I've ever seen
so it comes included with a pre fitted
monoblock that
you know clearly spans the entire CPU
the 16 phase digital vrm power delivery
and the chipset it's a water block it's
a mono block that covers the chipset as
well and it's it's just huge it's based
the entire diagonal length of the of the
motherboard it's great the whole thing
looks looks very thick you know yeah
super thick yeah it does and you know
probably only got them I'm cooling
cooling bits on it so no idea everything
everything that has to be said has
already been said about this thing let's
talk about the board a little bit it's
got some some plastic covering it's got
a plastic cover new the PCIe slots
probably just for dust defending or
something like that it has three metal
MDOT to heatsink so there's three and
got two slots
it also has onboard Wi-Fi aqua Tina I
almost thought it said Aquafina I was
like oh cool they make water
they don't make well they don't make
interesting crossover I'm aqua Tina 10
10 Gigabit Ethernet LAN as well as Intel
Gigabit LAN Thunderbolt 3 and more and
more so this is probably gonna cost a
pretty penny you're looking at I don't
know five hundred dollars easy right
five hundred bucks for this board that's
yeah probably
and-and-and-and up so lock and
everything the black with that black
don't think you can buy this board
without the block I think it's kind of
an all package one package deal it looks
like the the inlet and outlet have the
leak detection thing like like the Asus
point Asus did an rog board that had
that on it right thanks earlier x 299
i'd love to test that out if I wasn't so
scared damaging hardware
I'm sure jail tested probably like
probably one of the most expensive Z 390
boards yeah exactly
I'm just like induce leakage to test it
but then I guess if you have confidence
in the product then you should be the
product that you're least afraid of
testing it with true but and somehow we
managed to go through this whole story
without mentioning or GB once they were
just desensitized to it at this point we
didn't I thought you said that I did not
well should we take it for granted now I
don't see color so progressive okay so
next up we have an article from
overclocked 3d duh net about course
they're releasing fake dims how dare
they thank them fake dims fake news now
it's actually not quite as bad as it
might sound in fact you might be
interested in something like this if
you're looking to clean up the look of
your rig and make it look more expensive
by filling out all those DIMM slots
without having to pay a pretty penny
this is basically these are basically
dummy dims and they were showing these
off that was it copy text I believe
these are these are dummy dims that are
cosmetically identical to their
vengeance RGB pro series with ten
addressable RGB LEDs fully functional in
that sense but they are not actual
memory sticks they will not increase
performance or give you more capacity or
anything like that the upshot here is
that you can have that sort of robust
looking machine that looks really great
and has the sort of seamless RGB across
all the DIMM slots but at a
significantly reduced price and two of
these DIMMs I'm gonna call them fins
fittings Tim of these fittings fake
Tim's two of these fittings go for 40
bucks that's definitely a lot cheaper
than the hundreds of dollars you would
spend on like a 16 gigabyte you know
dual channel kit is a dual Channel kit
and the course they say it's 150 bucks
maybe hundreds but hundred and halfs
still 40 bucks versus 150 I thought that
was a video I'm terribly trying to find
it though here we go
there it is good and they're also
available in black or white so yeah I
don't know thoughts thoughts on this
Paul yeah everything opposition um well
Kyle it's interesting you should ask
that because we're gonna do ask the
audience on my part of the show where
we're gonna ask the audience just that
question and we'll see what they say
cool perfect well where's fun we were so
in everything in line but I was gonna
say we I didn't see this at
Computex but it was it was gigabyte -
had them gigabyte memory oh yeah that's
right gigabyte was like gigabyte is
saying here gigabyte memory and as I go
that's weird that's what I saw and then
they they had memory kits with you know
you could get it to stick fit and then
you can get the 32 sticks with the dummy
dims right and then I never heard
anything about those dummies from
gigabyte well maybe you're calling
gigabyte a bunch of dummies exercise
their it's their choice of words favored
it's how they're advertising it but
actually people in cheddar bring up a
good point people could easily resell
these as real DIMMs to people who don't
know that fake Corsair DIMMs exists and
they plug them in and nothing you mean
this has scammed potential written all
over as people would be stupid I mean
stupid or misinformed like plug it in
look it lights up it works totally works
the RGB means it goes faster seems legit
yeah I think there should be some ice or
some on post-its all right it's lit up
so it's a good thing we're talking about
this in case you were looking for some
you know vengeance RGB fromage y-you
have to watch the show so you can find
that about this stuff exactly we could
save you money and heartache let's move
on though hexxus net a they got word
from fanless tech who provided a photo
claiming that there's an upcoming intel
ghost Canyon nook mini PC on the rise
don't get too excited at least we're not
gonna see one of these these units till
early 2020 quite some time from now but
and so because it's so far away the
design and specification of this model
are subject to change of course I think
it looks pretty good looks pretty pretty
pretty small and compact very clean
looking I don't see any USB on the front
it does look like type-c ports or
something
these are type-c ports it's an SD card
reader yeah which is fine that does look
at like a USB icon that's fine with me
but just give me some USB type a as well
at least maybe it's on the other side
it's like on the slot on the right side
I don't know that should be a prototype
or whatever it's yeah it's a mini PC so
if it were
only on the back I guess it wouldn't be
terrible but I do like my front panel
USB type a so these are pretty
interesting they're supposedly gonna
sport an Intel coffee like HR processor
with up to eight eight cores and 16
threads and up to 45 watt up to a 45
watt TDP hey probably not gonna be able
to overclock anything here but having
those that high core and thread count is
it's pretty nice especially if you're
going to be gaining but what's even
better is that we may very well be
getting PCIe by 16 slot built in so that
means you would actually be able to buy
this unit with a pre-installed discrete
GPU or maybe a bare-bones model that you
just slot your own discrete card in
later which is actually pretty
compelling if it's a really that small
of a form factor this is only a 5 liter
case 5 liters that's you know imagine 5
litres of coca-cola and then put it into
a box and whatever how much it fills up
that's how big that is
that's how I think of it then pretty
much it's super-accurate and then yeah
so I don't know I think this is kind of
cool
we did have the was a skull canyon the
one that could gain recently is much
smaller than this one
people were doing like gaming videos on
it it was like the most powerful nuke
which one was that someone with the Vega
de Vega yes yes and now it was actually
pretty pretty compelling but it was a
fraction of the size really that that
this one is so you'd be able to fit a
lot more horsepower in here especially
with that by 16 slot if they talk about
the higher court counts then they're
probably trying to pitch this is
something that can you know get a little
bit more work done right daming
streaming you know editing things that
amount of them that to storage
expendability to this yeah and we have
three HDMI 2.0 ports there was no
mention of DisplayPort hopefully that
that comes included as well and two
Thunderbolt 3 so I think based on the
size here even though you could fit a
discreet card in there it looks like you
would have to go with a really short
card
perhaps a mini like a gtx 1070 1080i
mini they make them really small these
days when you know that's been she said
if you're really looking for a small
card you can find one
you know though tax gtx 1010 a BCI mini
is a great option
are there any r-tx mini cards yet I
thought there was a twenty seventy that
said it was a mini but it was so like a
to fan ones I didn't seem that mini
there's I feel like there's got to be
some sort of standardization some
standardized spec for for calling your
card a mini you can't just shave an inch
or two off and then say it's it's
miniature I mean you could but you'd be
dumb you'd be stupid for saying it
idiots so hey this this looks like a
great this looks like it has a lot of
potential especially for like a land a
land gaming PC or we're event you know
an event an event rig am I taking this
oh I see yes it says there's a 5/16 slot
but I don't see an actual picture of
that that's what that's what I was
looking for
so what's the deal again we don't really
we don't really know where fanless Tech
is getting their information from
they're the ones who are making these
claims
so obviously take everything that we're
saying here with a grain of salt but I
wouldn't put it past this machine
because it looks like it looks way
bigger than an oak because if you look
at just how big those you know how big
the case is five liters compared to a
regular look which is like super tiny
they've got to be cramming something
bigger in here and the other thing is
like look at that side panel it's all
vent it's all mesh like something in
there needs a lot of air yeah so I don't
know all right well who knows but who
knows okay this is all just an internal
shot and and all that yeah definitely I
was a little disappointed I noticed
there wasn't that no internal shot
either but very exciting stuff we can
move on to our next article once again
from hot hot hot hardware and this is
about the vivo necks have you heard the
good news have you heard about the vivo
next Paul um no Wow well I haven't
either
until today it's a phone it's apparently
a flagship Android phone that you can
only buy in China which is why it's
super relevant to us
and our American audience I see but I
think it's kind of cool this is a
breakthrough perhaps in phone design and
innovation
hashtag innovation so basically there
there was the original necks which tried
to solve the issue of having a stupid
ugly knotch design on your phone by
having like a little pop-up mechanism
for your camera so it was like a
mechanism that would just pop up or
whatever but it was clunky it didn't
work all that great so they came out
they just officially announced the
follow-up to that phone which is the
next vivo dual display edition which as
the name suggests this phone has two
displays the front display if you go up
that's the front display virtually bezel
as' it's all screen baby okay and it's
got a six point three nine inch AMOLED
display that's twenty three forty by ten
eighty if you scroll one picture down
that is the back of the phone that says
a horrible ugly bezels that it has
horrible ugly bezels but you already
have the super sexy display on the front
this is still I'm not looking at that
right now so see at this side of it and
I can't even see the other side so
what's the point of even having this
screen there the point is that this
screen is mainly used as a viewfinder
for when you're taking selfies so in
that sense I see it I feel like it only
serves that one purpose there's probably
other functionality you can use it with
use it for but that's the main that's
the main thing and this is where all the
cameras are there's three cameras all on
this side of the phone the cameras go
there yes you get a full like
practically bezels deal here right no
cameras on the front end and if you do
want to take a selfie you only need the
cameras facing this way and yes of
yourself there exactly and you see that
ring that's at the top that's their
lunar ring and it basically provides
like a diffusion flash when you're
taking selfies
I wonder how effective that is but it
looks kind of interesting yeah and then
it also could be used as a kind of
doubles as a notification indicator I'm
intrigued
yeah so others
Snapdragon 845 10 gigs of ram 10 gigs of
ram is actually a lot 128 gigs of
on-board storage no micro SD card slot
though 3.5 millimeter headphone jack is
still here which is becoming less common
on flexure pandering phones no no no
it's a premium feature you have to pay
extra for it of course it's the iPhone
way large 3500 milliamp battery and an
in display fingerprint reader reader
Ritter also becoming very popular
Android 9pi is what this phone ships
with out of the box albeit with the fun
touch OS 4.5 layered on top so fun touch
OS sends horrible it does sound really
bad I hate it I hate it I hate it
anything with the word fun in it is not
gonna be long I've already decided I
hate it yep not even gonna give me a
chance well you could root your phone
and just or actually just didn't Slyke
loading onto it root my pixel to put
some different protein Chinese companies
Android skin on it that'd be a great
great idea to each their own I suppose
but you're wrong it launches in China
early next year for around seven hundred
twenty bucks so there it is all of you
watching us from China go consider this
phone I guess our last story here on my
half is from hot Hardware PlayStation
classic it's been selling like hotcakes
but man is it hacked they hackable it's
so hackable man isn't hackable it's
there was a recent security flawed or
recent security flaw that was discovered
that lets hackers easily hack or crack
open Wow
the device to run additional games off
the USB Drive that's amazing the whole
the whole thing about these little
emulators these little classic additions
is that you have a select certain number
of games that you can play it's very
limited in that sense and that's what
keeps the cost of it down as well but
when you can hack it and play virtually
in a game on it it I feel like I feel
like people would pay a lot more for
that privilege of playing any game on it
but now you can do it for free with just
a little bit of tweaking of
of the code and they dated some database
editing and things like that so
apparently what what allow this to be
possible is that Sony hid the key that's
needed to decrypt the most sensitive
parts of this device software on the
device itself the key is on the device
so all they had to do was find it and
then you know for the PlayStation
classics we're getting cracked left and
right hacker you fond lieu uploaded
footage of crash bandicoot running via a
USB stick on his PlayStation Classic
which also brings up a good point
why was crash bandicoot not already one
of the pre-loaded games on the
PlayStation classic that was like the
one liked what's one of the most iconic
PlayStation games at least when I think
of PlayStation 1 and a crash bandicoot
is it so he's like the Super Mario of
its like Nintendo you know let's not put
Super Mario on the NES classic what are
you thinking anyway I was wanting to
play bubsy Claus Encounters of the Third
Kind you're telling me about that do it
it sounds sounds no it sounds like a
Harry Harry there's tons of puns in that
game now when when these mini consoles
first I came first started launching my
whole sort of thing was like alright
that's cute and all but like anyone who
really wanted to play any of these games
reasonably on a modern TV or something
like that could very easily get an
emulator and run it on a computer um you
know which is much more powerful and
everything like that so if now you're
talking about hacking the PlayStation
Classic which is you know no argument
against that could have been like oh
well people don't want to people don't
do that you know there's a legal gray
area and stuff like that if you don't
actually own the game but this is
obviously beyond that legal gray area
you're hacking the PlayStation Classic
so yeah why would anyone bother to go
out buy the PlayStation Classic bring it
back and then hack it with the USB stick
when obviously they would have needed a
computer to do that anyway
and they should just install any decent
emulator on their computer and load up
any PlayStation game they can legally
obtain because they of course own it at
the same time as well you that's you you
could that's all I'm saying couldn't you
still legally own
wait do they legally sell emulators I'm
not anyway the game simulators can be
created and distributed freely the games
the roms themselves right are the thing
that are illegal that is again depending
on the company you're tired that it's
it's actually something I haven't even
read up on recently I just know there's
a lot of them that but that's the thing
where if you have a website that's
hosting something that people are going
to download or whatever that's what
that's what the intellectual property
owners to get them to get those websites
taken debt right right yeah so I think
there should be like an emulator store
that's legally you know distributed by
you know Sony Nintendo whoever I mean
that they make money you know I like
like there's lots of things you could
say it like I'll be great if this
company acted this way I know did this
for people well yeah you could you can
easily see it being something that the
customers review positively and have a
better opinion of the company and even
something that they could you know sell
and and still make money off hoops to
some degree but I'm sure you know a lot
of companies will create their own
little walled garden thing where they
can charge what they want and often want
to charge especially with these retros
devices often seem to want to charge a
lot more or it just seems seems like the
price of that hardware is very expensive
especially if you like you look at like
gamers Nexus teardown or something like
that like they're not the same quality
as the original sure like the
controllers and everything like that so
right yeah yeah good points alright
let's let's move on to sponsor spot
sponsor spot this episode of awesome
hardware it's once again sponsored by
the one knurling Toshiba Toshiba and
they have provided us whoo
that was really close my heart skip over
and everything's fine I just I don't
know why with fate right they're very
good about having drinks around the area
for the most part but um yesterday I
spilled water and
chairman point being Toshiba sponsoring
awesome Hardware things today are this
is their OC z TR 200 it's a
two-and-a-half-inch say the rev three
six gigabit per second SSD using their
in-house CICS flash and it's a great
drive so great that Paul and I have
actually already used both of the
samples that they sent us yes
in personal rigs of ours or in show rigs
that we've done for the channel but I do
have those right here good also based on
v.i.c s flash is so she was XS 700 which
is a little external SSD which is USB
type-c that's also 3.0 USB 3.1 gen2 as
far as actual transfer protocol
compatibility comes with the USB type-c
cable and a little adapter anyway though
the ICS flash based Toshiba products are
linked in the description including a
little m dot to drive as well yep and
thanks to social buffer sponsoring
awesome hardware we love you have my
baby sister bucks thank you for
reminding me to do that of course not
doing that and then let's do some pin my
PC we did not do it last week so we are
doing it this week and you guys we're
very good to send in some pictures of
your dilapidated machines so the pol and
I can laugh at you that's what we do
best
so our first rig comes from mr. shadow
shadow bark whitey with a core i5 8600 k
people are mad at you for peaking again
I'm sorry we just remain down baby I
mean you just stop yelling I like doing
the show that's how I speak
alright so we have an intel compressor
for i-580 600 k in as rock Z 370 Pro for
Corsair 16 gigs of DDR for 3200 speed to
AMD Radeon 7600 he's not sure I don't
think it's it yeah very very 7000 series
yes yes they were well I don't know if
7670 oh he's just 650 just means it's in
the 7600
natural seven I've never heard of seven
seventy nine seventy I know 7970 that
was one sure okay alright so if you're
unsure of the exact cards you have if
the system runs presumably you can run
gpu-z just download and run gpu-z and it
will tell you what GPUs you have we're
looking your Radeon settings are there
yeah that's enough
that's also a possibility you have a
let's see
right this is a budget case I don't know
there's a case it's got a tuner
millimeter fan in the front 750 B maybe
possibly yeah
damnit cable management though yeah so
you got a lot of like just kind of loose
cables hanging down here in the bottom
there's also a 3.5 inch hard drive which
appears to just be propped up on its
side which is interesting kind of
concerned I guess if you're very
confident that the system isn't gonna be
kicked or moved at all but the system
also does appear to be on the floor
computer off floor computer off floor
who's clipping now oh sorry I get upset
sometimes mustard
yeah ketchup and mustard cables us it's
just it's not the prettiest looking
system overall it's also fairly dusty
and stuff be reduced there appears to be
a red LED light source up here at the
top by the all-in-one only matches with
the ketchup and yeah you've got one of
those really nasty copper colored
crossfire bridges cross fabric crossfire
bridge it does kind of match with the TX
750 and the parcel somehow somehow it
matches with something but yeah the
system needs a lot of love and care some
TLC get that cable management fixed up
we're that crossfire bridge and this
just shows you the great benefit of like
standard power supply trout basements
you know like that would cover up so
much of this weight just upgrade the
case 3d get a 3d printer and 3d print
yourself like a custom-made power supply
shroud basement
that's that's what I do should to spend
spend $500 on a 3d printer another 50
bucks on filament and then buy it and
then create yourself a $10 shred all
very reasonable suggestions thank you
thanks shadow
Burke YouTube loves showing the picture
over here next we have cam cam the core
i5 64 hundred gigabyte h1 10 M ACF
motherboard 16 gigs of PNY ddr4 Asus GTX
1066 gigabyte card and he says he uses
this system for for gaming and video
editing it's starting to show its age
and could use a good makeover I am broke
I'm a broke college grad and I could use
an upgrade
sorry about the dust will clean ASAP you
should be sorry about the dust we are
offended and hurt Dusty's Alaska Oh
intestinal stop cool yeah this is also
Jeanette so this is a very budget
bare-bones motherboard the H 110 chipset
yeah with an 80 664 sorry 6400 I was a
lost guy yeah I mean it's not like it's
an overclockable CPU or anything like
that since the writes not that terrible
I mean it's functional and everything
sure um but like I don't know like your
supplemental CPU power just kind of
string out there you got a loose fan
cable hanging out there you got these
awkward which appear to be either
Mexican or Italian and flag colored
cables I don't even know what these are
for where they're doing why are those
there what is that like this cable right
you're going to the motherboard appeared
on the motherboard this noise of USB
yeah I guess US beef are the front panel
cables on this on this case it's a
Zalman case that's so it's possible
anything's possible this almond case
true so three things that you would need
that I would upgrade first case
motherboard cooler your system really
has good bones but it just those three
things I think would totally refresh the
look and feel and even maybe some of the
performance of your system you can
probably salvage the case by clean
you know and everything and it does look
like there's some space behind the
motherboard trading route cables and
stuff like that but and actually your
power supply is not terrible yeah given
that you have all black cabling it's
it's an FX FX power supply they do not
make power supplies anymore
that means it must be named - I mean I
don't know how decent they were at it
but it's 80 plus bronze rated at least
so you know it's still alive and kicking
so some parts here you could definitely
salvage I would suggest considering you
know you're talking about the system
showing its age so since you don't have
a good base platform you might consider
updating that that new processor you've
already got ddr4 memory so that's good
you can definitely carry that kit that
kid over and your graphics card is also
pretty decent right so you've got a few
different options here I'd say if you
seriously want to go for a better
performance your your CPU and
motherboard would be a decent upgrade in
this system and you could do that
without changing too much else angry and
at the same time you know redo all your
cables and try to do something about the
burn the case and burn the camera all
right Phoenix Empire Xavier Xavier
horizon 7 1700 x and h SB 350 F gaming
ROG Strix motherboard a gigabyte n1
gaming GTX 1066 gig of Corsair Vengeance
RGB pro 16 gig 3000 speed memory it's a
kit for aizen that's 500 gig SSD one
terabyte WD hard drive Corsair 570 X
crystal series case 650 650 watt power
supply and of course their each 100 I
all on one this is we got some high-end
hardware here yeah this is already a
great looking system yeah I will say
that cable management's actually not
terrible - pretty solid I think you
could tighten up your your 24 pin ATX
cable a bit it's a little loose there
and maybe try to weave some of those
cables coming off of your water block
around the BRM heatsink what anime is
they're not completely covering it those
are nice pretty heatsink show them off
don't don't cover them up with those
nasty cables check can we get an idea on
what anime this is up on the wall here I
don't know I just I'm not even gonna try
this for science
probably all right so I for some reason
like maybe just a picture it doesn't
seem like it's a super nice camera so
the Corsair AIO thing here just looks a
little smudged and scratched and I feel
like that's kind of standing out to me
yes I'm not looking as clean did you
already say the 24-pin could be kind
enough yeah okay now mention that did
you mention the 120 millimeter exhaust
no but yes yeah that's loop around cable
here not not the greatest right you know
you're plugging a debt in at a place in
the motherboard that's difficult to hide
but I'd still maybe try to go up here
and then hide it down beneath the
heatsink or something like that
yeah or just see if you can write it up
here and if there's any other plugs on
that's along the top you could use that
really good but that's that's pretty
much it I mean just a few little things
here and there and then quick fixes and
then the next time you send us a picture
use a use a DSLR or something yeah we
can figure that out potato phone that is
Hatsune Miku apparently absolutely
that's Hatsune Miku her full name is Pat
Sumi me go sorry I'm peaking all right
hey oh sorry I don't be to do mystery
solved
can't help it all right thanks I'm here
yeah good-looking system next we have G
alza' H 400 I MSI H 110 another H 110
motherboard and we have a core i7 6700
this time with a thermal take contact
712 8 gigs of a Vita xpg rip just oh and
he has 8 gigs of rip just four so to
differ is and we have a gtx titan z Wow
EVGA next 750 B and yeah ok we got him a
Titan Z dang Titan Z that's that's crazy
I think for just altima compatibility
and aesthetics get one memory kit one of
the other I mean if he's got if he got
another stick and it was rated for the
same speed and he plugged
got the speed and timings running then I
would say in this situation it looks
slightly awkward but at least they're
both red I don't know
the Titans II only comes in one flavor
so how much you can do about that but it
really stands out in this bill great I'm
gonna grab beer I can keep talking
though call them I've got a lav mic on
the beauty of labs I'll take one too if
you don't mind okay I think it surprised
me I think the the cooler is probably
more than adequate for your 6,700 but
you could go with something more stylish
down the line if you know if you were
into that sort of thing
I think you've also got ketchup and
mustard on your motherboard as well as
your graphics card which stood up maybe
go with some red sleeving
or perhaps red and green to stretch out
that green elements on your Titan
although then it would look like a
Christmas build anything with green and
red when green and red are your primary
colors in a rig it doesn't matter what
what else you do it will look like a
Christmas build to me anyway but hey if
that's occurring - oh it's good red and
maybe do a mod on that Titan change the
LED color to white I think that would
look super sexy in it looks pretty good
there's also a bunch of dust though
William CC trout and probably other
parts of the system that I just can't
see it does look pretty dusty on the
front panel as well where that
ventilation is you want to clean that
off make sure to clean it regularly and
everything looks pretty snazzy guys in
chat if you guys have anything else to
contribute feel free to do so would you
get me Nobu thank you
all right we got one two more and one
more time uh to us one plus a ghost Moss
let's see
honorable mention okay we have this one
from off offset offset with his resin
2600 X and horas X 470 gaming ultra GTX
1070 asus rog OC cooler master 212 Evo
and looks like we have a corsair carbide
spec zero three case and some decent
storage options there alright so I
really like the theme here
you've really stuck with black and red
it's very very defined yeah which is
great and you get that stripper clear
stripper heel fan on the back right
there we generally aren't huge fans of
that but you know to each their own the
hyper 212 cooler while it is a great
budget option it is looking a little
dated these days and you could probably
find something rule that nicer that also
has some red accents red and black is
one of the most common color themes in
it also comes in black it comes in black
now comes black there's there's a hyper
212 black edition I was like asking
coolermaster for like three years I
finally did it it's $35 that's not bad
at all so it's not that much more to
Chevy it only the only way that it seems
crappy is when they have the hyper 212
for 20 bucks and then ah yeah 15 more
dollars for making it black true which
is a steep market but yeah and there's
other choices too it's still cheaper
than problem it's gonna say you're your
SanDisk SD plus down there just kind of
just kind of hanging out without any any
support mm-hmm which which is which is
sad so maybe a 3.5 inch adapter bracket
there to hold that up would would make
it seem a little bit more comfortable
granted that's not necessary it's an SSD
you can hang out there no problem but
we're talking aesthetics here it also
looks like he's using one of your
techniques Paul to hoist his GPU up a
bit go on version sagging you think that
the power cord there that is a positive
on this build here very very minimal or
not any at all GPU sag yeah it might
even be tied up here or something like
that looks like it maybe tuck away that
little PCI Express a daisy-chain cable
there too right so yeah all these
suggestions I think the rear fan the
hyper 212 and that SSD I think of the I
mean main points yeah a very nice build
though
thank you sir excellent choice for my
opponents and finally we have a
honorable mention from Mary Ann hey Mary
with her I would assume it's to her
white build sorry it's not risin five
2600 X msid 350 gaming Pro carbon
knocked to addy 15s with the chrome
accent so nice of course our vengeance 2
by 16 gig kid of 3000 megahertz ram a
galaxy GT X 1080 Hall of Fame
Silverstone Strider 600 watt power
supply inside of a fractal design mesh
fic with some NZXT air fans plus hue
lighting hey I thought this was the
cleanest system that I saw old it in my
Twitter that is super super duper clean
it is it's it's almost perfect it's so
nice I just love the teal accents as
well the lighting choice they're just
that chrome X color looks so clean oh my
god and I like the cables too like how
it's very like neutral tones just kind
of white and grey the AC the accessory
cables and everything coming from the
the the PC are wrapped - in the back
there oh yeah yeah nice nice cable
management beautiful attention yeah yeah
so yeah obviously no nothing to be added
here just just a beautiful build I like
the little cars down there an accent as
well is this the GPU support does that
list it here separately is that
something that comes with what the whole
thing that looks like it comes with it
cuz I see a Hall of Fame logo logo on
there right
mmm PC tech also makes a very very
similar looking right support brackets
like that that I've seen before baby
looks really nice yeah I like how part
of its black so I almost didn't see it
at first because it just blends them
boring this left part cool beautiful -
thanks alright that concludes pip my PC
and my half of the show hurrah
so if you guys happen to donate anything
in Super chat on my half we will be
reading off the messages you've attached
to those donations at the end of Paul's
half during the after-party
which would be a separate stream
entirely and yeah we're gonna switch
over to pulse Paul's the post guys tell
us like on this video if you enjoyed it
and also feel free to do any time stamps
anyone who wants the new time stands for
my half is much appreciated thank you so
much in advance and don't go anywhere
because we'll be right back
