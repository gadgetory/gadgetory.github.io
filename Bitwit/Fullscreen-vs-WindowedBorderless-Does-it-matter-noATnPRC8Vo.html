channel hope you're all doing well so I
recently saw a bunch of people online
arguing what else is new about which
viewing mode is best for gaming
performance the three main options being
fullscreen windowed and windowed
borderless those last two were kind of
the same thing more on that later and
while some folks felt there was little
to no difference between these modes
others reported significant variations
in frames per second based on how they
were viewing their games the idea here
is that when your game is running in
full-screen or exclusive full-screen
mode the graphics driver has complete
control over the screen output when in
either of the windowed modes however
Windows Explorer acts as a sort of
middle man
managing where on-screen to draw the
output this eats up additional resources
which some claim can significantly drop
your in-game performance so today we'll
run some tests to see if that's really
the case we may find that like most of
the time it depends things like the game
engine itself whether you're running one
or more GPUs at a time or even the
number of connected displays are all
factors that have been reported to cause
changes in performance between view
modes I'll be running today's tests with
my personal setup a single ultra wide
display in the form of an Acer predator
X 34 and my gaming PC hotlines though I
have disabled SLI and will only be using
one of its gtx 980ti s so let's dive
right into some benchmarks starting with
the division here we see some very
similar results between all three modes
with fullscreen pulling ahead by a very
slight margin after re running the games
burnin benchmark multiple times
fullscreen consistently came out on top
with higher scores though you'd never
know it from simply playing the game as
the results are so closely grouped
together doom 2016 also revealed
identical performance across the board
at this point the results are just too
similar to differentiate any real
advantage from margin of error in GTA 5
fullscreen barely pulls ahead while
windowed and Vorta lists for virtually
identical results which isn't too
surprising given their outputs are
managed by the same process in the
desktop windows manager again exclusive
fullscreen is the only mode whose input
lag is being driven solely by the
graphics driver finally I ran hitman to
uncover yet again our various modes
performing neck and
check this was the only game where full
screen gets edged out by windowed mode
albeit by one frame in average FPS and
1% lows averaging out all the scores we
can see that full screen barely
outperforms both windowed modes by a
fraction of a frame
it appears the overhead within Windows
Explorer incurs next to no performance
loss with the games and hardware tested
today of course not every game will give
you the same results as I mentioned
earlier and some titles just aren't
optimized for all viewing modes equally
take overwatch for example I actually
began testing this game earlier before
realizing windowed mode actually shrank
the window size and lowered the
resolution this yielded much higher
frame rate since the GPU had fewer
pixels to render which made for an
unfair comparison so I tossed the data
out some games like overwatch have also
been plagued with greater input lag in
windowed mode due to windows 8 and 10
forcing triple buffering in the desktop
window manager perhaps a follow-up video
on input lag specifically is in order
once I get my hands on a high-speed
camera to properly measure any latency
these random quirks make it near
impossible to nail down a definitive
answer to today's question but based on
our results you could make the
generalization that exclusive full
screen mode ensures you're squeezing
every last ounce of performance out of
your gameplay though it will likely have
little to no impact on your perceptible
experience I would think this is good
news for streamers and multitaskers who
prefer to run their games in windowed or
borderless in order to quickly alt-tab
between different windows not to mention
there's less chance of your game
crashing when doing so switching between
the graphics driver and dwma exe isn't
always a graceful handoff before you
guys go though let me know what you
think about all this what your
experience has been in different view
modes have you found a game that
performs notably better in one mode over
the other feel free to add your own data
in the comments otherwise you guys can
