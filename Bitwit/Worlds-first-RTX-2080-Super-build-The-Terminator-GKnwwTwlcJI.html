launch of the nvidia geforce r-tx 2080
super we officially get to see all of
the performance benchmarks for this GPU
none of which I'll actually be giving
you today because I was a little
strapped for time this week for reasons
I really won't get into we're gonna be
doing the build today with this card
it's technically the world's first r-tx
2080 super build in that sense because
this video is posting or should be
posting right at the time the embargo
lifts for this car technically the title
of this video is not 100% cliff Bait
don't get used to it though and before I
rattle off the parts for today's build I
wanted to really quickly say a couple
words about the r-tx 2080 super for
starters this is a full fat T 104 GPU
same GPU that was in the existing RT X
2080 but now it's got all of its cores
unlocked and ready to go that being said
it's not a whole lot more cores or not
many more cores it's actually only a 4.3
percent bump in CUDA cores over the r-tx
2080 similarly the boost clocks have
been raised slightly by just 6.1 percent
the biggest change is really the memory
speed going from fourteen to fifteen
point five gigabits per second which is
about a ten point seven percent gain if
I remember correctly so as you can see
the specs haven't really changed a whole
lot over the existing RT X 28 II
certainly not enough to put this card as
I sort of even stopgap between
RTX 2080 and RT X 20 atti so if I'm just
assuming things because I have not again
tested this card at all and I haven't
seen anybody else's benchmarks I'm going
to expect this card to perform maybe
five to seven percent faster on average
than in RTX 2080 non-super it's
definitely gonna come nowhere close to
an RT X 20 atti so if you're thinking
that you know Nvidia is just almost
flash their prices on that card in half
that's not the case at all at least this
is what I'm assuming so what's the point
of this card then you ask well the
pricing is is pretty competitive all
things considered at 699 MSRP this is
cheaper than what the RT X 2080
initially launched for and it's about
the same price that you can find in RTX
2084 right now this is not meant to be a
big upgrade over the RT X 2080 it's more
or less meant to replace it very much
like the other Super cards
in the lineup so that's pretty much all
I wanted to say about this cart again go
ahead and watch your favorite press for
viewers and tech tubers for verification
on everything I just said because I
could be completely wrong with that out
of the way let's talk about the bill
wifey sauce actually deemed this build
she took a look at the parts for like 10
seconds she's like you should call it
the Terminator or the Terminator build
which I really like the I really like
that idea because it's a silver themed
PC and Terminator the Terminator is
known for destroying things it's it's
sent out to seek and destroy very much
like this this new gaming PC will do to
all of today's triple-a titles it's just
going to absolutely crush any game that
you throw at it
that's what we're going with today this
is the Terminator starting with the in
win 905 this is the new case that they
were showing off at Computex this year I
saw it and they're like do you want us
to set I was like yes it actually
improved the airflow over the in win 904
I think it was where they actually have
nice ventilation all at the bottom so
you actually get most your intake or a
good amount of your intake from the
bottom as well as the front and you
can't see it but on the other side of
the case there is like pretty ample
ventilation going all the way down top
to bottom so we're gonna be filling it
up with these Noctua n ff12 fans that I
actually stole from my two asus rog
ryojun 360 coolers the a iOS not to say
if the included fans in this case are
bad or anything but there's only three
of them two at the front one at the back
and I wanted six fans so we're gonna do
three at the bottom and two at the front
one at the back and the two of the front
are gonna be radiator fans so I wanted
to make sure that the fans that we're
using have high static pressure as well
as being just all-around good case fans
and you really can't go wrong with
Noctua we're gonna be using two of these
fans I'm going parts completely out of
order here you can see I've already got
them all over the table screen about two
of these fans like I said are going to
be going on an AI Oh specifically the
Corsair H 100 I RGB Platinum 240
millimeter liquid a IO does does support
a m4 so we're good to go there it's got
a nice silver trim around the waterblock
so it's gonna match nicely as well and
yes I would consider it a sin to not use
the ML 120 Pro fans that come included
with this cooler unless you're replacing
them with something of equal or greater
quality like these not to us driving our
system I've got a cooler master v8 50
power supply been using this unit a lot
lately just for random builds and test
beds mainly because it's got a quiet fan
it's super reliable 80-plus platinum
fully
modular and it's it's 850 watts which is
plenty to drive most of today's systems
as you can see I've already started
prepping our motherboard a bit here with
the CPU memory installed but this is the
asrock X 570 Taichi it is a hell of a
board it looks incredible it is actually
one of the nicest looking X 570 boards
in my opinion it has a 12 plus 2 phase
power design with a couple heat sinks on
top being connected by a copper heat
pipe very nice silver accents all
throughout we have an active cooling fan
that's actually underneath this
ventilation area at first I thought it
was this copper wheel but that's just
for aesthetics it's kind of a steampunk
effect and we do have a nice backplate
there as well our CPU is none other than
the Rison 930 900 x12 core 24 thread
part and at the moment I could see no
better CPU to pair with our r-tx 20/80
super so this is gonna be a skewed
register this is going to be a full AMD
and NVIDIA built sorry and tell you the
odd man out this time around for memory
we have an 8 by 4 gig kits giving us 32
gigs of G skills try that and Zinio ddr4
at 3600 speed very nice frequency good
sweet spot for a risin 3000 very similar
looking to the existing tried NZ RGB
modules especially from the front you
can't really even tell a difference but
on the side you do get a silver plate
there that's gonna match Oh so perfectly
with the rest of our hardware this being
the x5 70 platform we do open up the
possibility and support for PCIe Gen 4
so I'm gonna be using the same SSD this
is the only PC agent for nvme and to
drive that I have on hand this is the
gigabyte or s PCIe gen 4 nvme SSD using
the same vice on controller that pretty
much every existing pc agent for nvme
drive is currently using it's a 500 gig
capacity if this was my personal system
I'd probably be adding a mechanical
drive as well for additional storage but
seeing as how it's just for a vanity
build for today this should do the job
just fine now somehow circling all the
way back to fan stuff we have some of
these fantex halo luxe digital RGB fan
frames these are great if you want to
add a little bit of lighting a little
bit of bling to an otherwise ordinary
fan that doesn't have lighting already
so I'm actually be strapping them to our
nff 12 today finally we wouldn't want to
taint the look of our rig using stock
power supply cables it's just it's just
nasty so instead we're gonna be using
these sleeved extensions from Asia horse
than using their products for quite some
time now these are the nylon sort of
nylon material as opposed to paracord
which means they don't turn is tight but
they sure as hell retain their shape a
lot better they're much easier to train
especially if you're using cable combs
which we will be and overall very nice
products for not too much money I think
it was like 30 to 33 bucks for the
entire box which comes with everything
you need for a standard built like this
as always guys feel free to check out
the links in the description below if
you're interested in any of this stuff I
can't confirm right now if the RTR 2080
super links will be there because it's
just so early but I'll be sure to update
those links as these GPUs become
available on select retailers with that
said I am ready and super pumped to get
terminating on this new computer build
James Garner get down or to the chopper
the Terminator is looking pretty
gosh-darn good if I do say so myself the
red LEDs that was another great idea by
wifey sauce and it looks very menacing
especially when all the ambient lights
are off and you just see that red glow
inside the chassis ooh it's just it
looks so good especially with the silver
and just like the brushed aluminum on
the end when 9:05 and I really
appreciate in one's efforts to improve
the functionality of their cases as well
having these removable trays for
radiators is very nice you have a
modular one at the bottom for your 360
and another one at the front for your
240 definitely feels like they're being
brought up to speed they're bringing
themselves up to speed with a lot of the
other competitive cases in today's
chassis market additional airflow having
ample airflow at the front now when it
used to be very closed off that being
said I would still like to see some
freaking rubber grommets on their
flagship cases where are the rubber
grommets why are they just cutouts I
mean I get it maybe that's the look
you're going for but at the same time I
shouldn't have to try so hard to hide
any of the cables behind the motherboard
tray in a case that costs as much as
this one does so having some rubber
grommets would go a long way I think to
clean up the aesthetic and just make a
more premium feeling product and it
wouldn't hurt to have some additional
fan or radiator mounts at the top of the
case like this one because right now
there's just there's absolutely nothing
there's no mounting support at the top
of the case it's completely flat and
closed off at the very least maybe
create some ventilation holes so that
hot air can be exhausted at the top
being pushed out by the other fans in
the case but apart from that very very
lovely system featuring and honoring the
launch of the r-tx 2080 super you guys
let me know what you think down below
I'm gonna get out of here guys thanks so
much for watching this video to us I
know I got up before you go and get
subscribe for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon have a good one guys I
will see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
