saved it is it's confusing because
there's still so many people in chat but
yep it's unlisted ok well the link is
there on my half so that ya know yeah go
to it
yeah I just if no one wasn't the chatted
be very I did not pee for two hours yeah
it was a long peon usually lot quicker
that's not true
stop pin on those beers bladder can't
keep up
they got on my hands at all right I'll
make sure I wash through go right the
very weak
okay we're live little I've to both hey
how's it going everyone welcome to
awesome hardware episode 146 side beat
if you missed side a go to Paul's
channel it's Paul's hard work or no
youtube.com slash Paul's hardware or you
can find the link in the video
description of my youtube channel my
youtube video this is a live tech news
show that we stream every single Tuesday
at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right here on
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware or to
our respective YouTube channels
obviously today the second half is on my
channel and it's a fun tech news show we
like to have a good time have a few
drinks if you are of legal drinking age
in your country feel free to drink
responsibly with us it's a good time
makes us more interesting and you can
also check out wait no what was the
other thing
Oh quick disclaimer we occasionally will
swear when when the energy is heightened
and we get excited about certain things
so if you're particularly sensitive to
that just be aware that this is a pg-13
type show sometimes rated R but never
rated X because youtube doesn't allow
that it's supposed to be swapped but
it's not swapped properly but that's
fine was it locked up in your half my
half it said you were awesome hardware
they said you were awesome sauce news oh
yeah I used a really old one that's
weird because we saved that same profile
it's fine anyway the show must go on
ladies and gentleman if you'd like to
buy anything from either of our stores
Paul's heart paul's store is what is it
okay my store is bit with tech slash
store with I think the new CPU cooler
bottle openers are for sale they they
they open bottles very easily very
responsible yep our Internet
weird right now hopefully that doesn't
affect the stream also the rip gamepad
shirt is in stock now it's brand new
design my store is pulsar Burnett barber
done it my metallic silver men's black
tri-blend shirt is going to be
end-of-life soon so get them while
they're hot Haley and if you buy stuff
during the show we'll shout out your
name at the end of this half yeah John
sense and we'll give you a Johnson we
express our grateful gratefulness to you
we'll leave our johnson at you i'm holy
crap I usually say these for the end but
thank you very much AB to stretch I have
to tract or abstract for the hundred
dollar donation guys comment to it we'll
save the comment for the we'll save the
comment for later but if you continue
donating we'll read all the messages you
attach to those donations at the end of
this half the show so thank you very
much in advance keep giving us money
alright our first segment for today is
to fund or not to fund we're taking a
look at three crowd funded campaign
products these things who knows what
they are the first one is the lumo it's
a mini transporter which is kind of like
a robot sidekick according to the post
here they've already funded nearly a
million dollars out of their $100,000
goal so people clearly have an interest
in this self-balancing transporter that
features AI with intel's real real sense
technology it features auto follow video
capture touch voice and gesture control
so you could use it for like video
conferences you know oh I'm sick I can't
make it to the meeting but I can send my
weird little Segway robot minion out for
me and then I could hear and and see
everything that it sees and then respond
and this is like a dude that's
pretending to be a robot - it's very
cute and yeah I mean it's got a playful
personality this is like a smart robot
you could write it - so it's that it
doesn't just follow you you could
actually like hop on top of it and get
around that way if you're a lazy asshole
at some convention CES or whatever it's
only $1,400 $1,400
I want three yeah I think I need a
little army of them just to do my
bidding get me groceries lumo you know
entertain my friends LUMO make me money
mo take a selfie right take a selfie cuz
I can't just use my arm that would be
too much work you love's look there's a
little love thing - oh he's cute and
then you can you can you can you can
make him hold a tray and put flyers on
it be like hey LUMO I hand out these
Flyers to random strangers that won't
certainly steal you and try to sell you
for thousands of dollars hundred dollar
piece of portable technology yeah just
just go out enough fun wander on your
own like I'd rather send my kid out
there you know cuz kids you can just
make a new one okay so that happens so
um there's there's LUMO next up we've
got the kira mechanical keyboard this
already has two hundred and eighty
thousand dollars funded of it's fifty
thousand dollar goal this is a compact
keyboard but it also does have a keypad
ten key number pad which is pretty
impressive for how slim this thing looks
at first glance it's fully programmable
via the hardware we've seen a lot of
like coolermaster does this they have
programmable keys
that's all hardware based you could just
create macros on-the-fly with the keys
themselves I think that's pretty cool
however it's still open source so you
know if you want to like put some
programming here on github that supports
a software version of programmable
interfaces with this keyboard you can
easily do that it has perky RGB lighting
obviously one thing that surprised me is
that it's using a USB type-c port for
its power and data so that's that's good
that's good and that's something that I
feel like should be adopted more more
more often with these mechanical type
keyboards that have detachable cables
it also features PBT die some sublimated
sublimated keycaps
in-house hako switches this is a
something that's made in-house by the
company that makes this keyboard I've
never heard of hako switches before they
do look like they have some cherry MX
keycap stems where it's got the little T
stem where you could replace it with
your own Cherry MX
keycaps if you wanted to but I have no
idea how the hakko switches perform and
feel according to them they're good
obviously they would say that and this
is retailing or you can get a
Kickstarter early early access for a
hundred and sixty nine dollars which
they're deliciously tactile deliciously
tactile is the adjective used okay sure
why not
so one hundred and seventy bucks for
this keyboard which is pretty much on
the highest end of of pricing that you
can find with with mechanical keyboards
right now so it is fairly steep
expensive yeah it is very pricey next
and finally we've have the Diggs rival
dog crate and I only you I only choose
dog dog products for to fund or not to
fund because I know Paul has dogs dog
and so I like to choose these dog
products these dog related or dog owner
targeted products to see what Paul
thinks of them because I cannot relate
to I only have cats and they destroy
everything I love so I would never
invest any sort of money into them but
Paul might into his loving dogs they're
adorable and cute I do that sometimes
so and there's clearly demand for this
to some degree it's it's already funded
46,000 of its $30,000 goal this is
essentially a dog crate that is
collapsible you can take it anywhere it
can fold down to a fairly small size you
put in your your trunk easily even to
your front seat it's fairly attractive
compared to the the sort of wireframe
the wireframe cages that we typically
see that kind of makes it look like your
dog's just kind of suffering in a jail
cell like that they do a really good job
here in the promo ad just making it look
like the dogs having a terrible time in
a conventional dog carrier it's safe you
know there's no risk of your dog getting
its paw or its head or tail stuck into
it so this is essentially how it works
it folds up like so and pops it up and
there you go your dog can fit in it and
be happy and look good there's a tray
for poops I would imagine or whatever
kind of shit that your dog brings in
that Doug's pretty fucking happy to be
there I think goals hey you know it's
it's good for tinkling look at he just
walks in like I want to be caged fuck
yeah if it's like this all day I'm down
so it's the dig
memory foam mattress in there yeah fuck
I don't even get that at home you know
so this dogs live in la vida loca chill
like a boss in this revolutionary dog
carrier what do you think Paul 57 bucks
about this product 57 dollars
yeah all right that's not bad I was
expecting more it seems like it's more
suited for smaller dogs yeah yeah like
based on the video at least I I have two
dogs Nori's about 40 40 pounds heroes
more like a hundred pounds yeah no wait
here okay don't Matt here are no way
nori I think would also be a little
tight a little tight in here yeah yes
they had a larger version of it though
could you see yourself yeah you know
here's my question do you ever possibly
like the ever having laps the collapse
size here it's not that collapsed right
that's still fairly thick yeah so it's
not it's definitely not getting down to
as small of a footprint as as the the
crappy cages they show earlier and the
thing right but it definitely looks like
Union you could more easily fit it in a
trunk at the very least possibly because
I don't think it like a full sized cage
could ever fit in a trunk realistically
but at least this can fit in your trunk
but you know and because you have big
dogs they already take up a lot of space
once you put them in the car right so
having a cage and your dog in the car in
the backseat for example might might be
a little stuffy but you were you were
actually mistaken it's $57 for the pad
just for the pad yeah oh yes great pad
so it's 135 dollars sighs 135 then 135
for the crater the Craven small crate
156 for the crate and the pad combo pack
that's all for small side cuz I know you
have a dog cage at home but do you ever
need to take it out of the house not
really
that's what I was thinking I was like
isn't a dog cage mainly for home use so
the fact that it's portable and can
collapse is kind of a moot point yeah
unless you have any other
are there any other application when you
would need to break them but then again
when you have a small dog there's
there's there's a like there's more
small places where the small dog could
go and escape to and stuff like that so
maybe if you have a smaller dog you're
more likely to be bringing around a
portable cage I don't know I don't know
medium and large sized dogs so yeah it's
it's hard to say for sure okay well what
about well what about the keyboard and
the robot sidekick that we took a look
at do either of those stand out to you
as something that you would buy
personally um the keyboard seems like
it's a keyboard and there's lots of
different keyboards and lots of people
are very specific about the keyboards
they want there wasn't anything that
stood out to that about that keyboard
that made me like wow that's so much
different than lots of other keyboards
yeah I've seen so I guess the robot um
just yes it seemed very different yeah
lumo what would you do with it if you
could send it out and do your bidding
would you have a do for you for me
personally like like when I do videos
like if I go into a video when I'm
walking out out and about and whatever
this could actually follow me around to
get just tracking shots of me going
different places that yeah that could be
pretty useful for me kind of like it
kind of like a drone with the auto
follow feature that you know but it
wouldn't like kill you from its blades
just like stabbing you in the eye yeah
maybe it's a little bit more a little
bit more practical and you can hop on
towed around write it around - right
that's true super can get you from A to
B for convenience if you did that with a
drone you would just end up breaking it
if you stepped on it so okay cool I I
think I'm with you on there so cool but
that's that's that's that segment let's
move on pin my PC my busy Bret Oh Bret
Oh Bret John you and your system no it's
actually not that bad with a core ice
core i5 7600 K it is at 4.8 gigahertz
you have a hyper - 12 X in here and
asrock fatality k-6 motherboard 16 gigs
- my aching sticks of ddr4 2666 of
corsair memory sand
SSD 240 gig with the GTX 1050 ti4
gigabyte card and that's all inside of
an NZXT s340 elite ok looks like you're
going with the black and red theme which
is great because quite frankly your
graphics card will allow nothing else
thanks MSI for locking users into a
black and red color scheme even your
your your cable management looks pretty
solid it looks like your VGA cables
could be improved a bit because they're
sort of you know split off and it looks
like one connector is just kind of
dangling there so my suggestion would be
like many others is to get a kit of
extensions some sleeves extensions would
do you some favors here especially in a
nice case like this where the cable
management is pretty solid it's a bug
what is this bug a bug oh yeah there is
a massive massive bug or critter inside
of your case that is most likely
impeding heavy airflow so you'll need to
eradicate or you'll need to remove that
bug quarantine it as soon as possible
your temperatures depend on it ok
thermal sustainability is at risk get
rid of that bug it's glowing blue like
it's absorbed some of the power of the
computer yeah and it yeah it's probably
gonna like defecate all over your SSD
there before you know it so make sure
you quarantine that shit
run run malwarebytes to get rid of any
bugs oh yeah that might uh you know
settle into your system and you should
be smooth sailing other than that man
your system looks pretty good
I like the red LED fans at the front I
will say an amendment sort of an
addendum to the the clear fan blade
thing because you know Paul and I hate
on clear fans we've been doing we're
clear LED fans for a while I think in a
budget a more budget oriented system
like this one they're more tolerable
because they allow some some
illumination inside of your case without
having to buy a straight up LED
a strip or LED system so if you wanted
to you can actually match those fans
with the back the rear fan and your top
fan could also be the same exact fans
that you have it at the front of your
case I think that would look pretty good
maybe even slap one of those onto your
hyper - 12 X that would look pretty
sweet
everything would be very matchy-matchy
be nice other than that very clean
system well done sir Thank You Bret
thanks Brett
next we have Paul I thought I told you
not to submit unpin my pc no this is a
different poll oh well in that case
let's let's uh let's welcome him to the
pit my PC group here we have an i7 8700
K on top of an gigabyte Z 370 XP sli to
8 gig Corsair Vengeance lpx 2400 Styx
NZXT kraken x50 t1 gigabyte geforce gtx
1080 windforce and a thermal take tough
power 750 gold Samsung Evo 2 and 50 gig
SSD and so forth so this is a bill that
when I look at it first off from the
outside with the tempered glass side
panel on there looks beautiful I love
the overwatch decal I think it really
adds some personality yeah and then and
looking inside it's well centered to
putting down a decal like that yeah
middle of a big blank tempered glass or
plexiglass on tacky doesn't look too
amateur and then we also have a nice
internal layout here everything's super
clean cable management's on point if you
wanted to pimp out your PC as is what
the segment's all about I would
definitely suggest like the last user
investing in some cable extensions
definitely would help you out here even
though these black ones aren't too bad
they're still sort of that rubbery
material with the rubber casing the wire
casing and they don't look all that
great there's a lot of potential with
this system I feel like everything's
good to go you do have a motherboard
that has a rather brownish PCB there's
not much you can do about that but at
the very least you can maybe swap out
those those case fans for something a
little bit more stylish
if you
to bring some bling to your rig overall
maybe get some RGB fans in there to
match I mean after all you you know you
do have a crack and x52
or is that X 54 sorry X 52 in there
sorry that that already has RGB lighting
on it if you want to just sort of take
that up a notch you could invest in some
RGB fans but Oh Massa I want to say it's
good there's a little I feel like these
the X 52 has several cables coming at
the top of it I feel like this could be
tidied up just a little bit there and
the red caps on the PCI Express power
cables are standing out to me a bit here
they're not too bad since they're kind
of the main accent color besides black
and white right but since there's a
sense there's a daisy chain this extra
extra bit um stands out a little bit
there
mmm so a cable extension or you can also
replace those caps as a project to
either either those I think would finish
things off yeah nice build up thank you
very much all right all next up we have
album W Ellen Project purple Scorpio has
an i7 6700 K a Strix 1066 gig 16 gigs of
tread NZ RGB 2400 speed memory and EVGA
550 G - a part of our killer Z 270 AC
what is that is it killer wait but
what's the killer motherboard oh oh the
the the asrock ezra yeah fatality killer
or I start killer okay yeah anyway Z 270
motherboard yeah maybe he meant as rock
uh yeah it took me a second thing okay a
couple ml 120 blue fans a couple ml 140
blue fans or cravaack air cooler and 850
Evo 250 and 960 Evo 500 and 500 gig and
a fem text and to evolve modded the mod
is pretty sweet I want to just draw
attention to the mod really quick the
front front panel there okay because the
this case is known to suffer from
airflow because of its closed off front
panel so this obviously helps things a
bit
I'd be very curious to see what kind of
temp drops you you received from that
mod what's really nice though pretty
straightforward rectangular cutout here
with a dust filter yeah so it's a nice
month it is functional
I like the Scorpion graphic on the SSD
in a very nice location there I think
the cables are looking great there as
well mm-hmm
cable cabling here for your your 24-pin
your supplemental your your 8 pin for
CPU and graphics card and the SSD
they're all looking really nice and you
get bonus points in my book for having
hot line colors oh yeah yeah well well I
appreciate the reverse shot of the cable
management's that's looking quite clean
as well GPU sag though GPU saygus is
really the standout here yeah and
there's various ways of combating this
you can get a stand that sits from the
bottom just above the power supply tray
there's brackets that attach to the
other graphics card mounting points here
for PCI and PCI Express expansion slots
that could also work out for you yeah
that and I guess maybe the power supply
yeah power sticker yeah the yellow on
that doesn't match quite as well with
the rest of the system so maybe maybe
that we met up could also be heatgun
daft or something like that but overall
very nice though those those are minor
issues you have a really clean really
nice looking system
thanks Alan alright next up we have an 8
it's super panda Nate Dogg alright so
he's got a real Toro CR 1280 case an msi
970 gaming motherboard an AMD FX 6200 at
4.1 gigahertz being cooled by a courser
H 115 or H 115 I 4x4 gigs of crucial
ddr3 and an X afar or I'm sorry XFX r9
390 okay there's a bit of color clash
here we've got red LED fans blue memory
ketchup and mustard cables with some
yellow in there so
at the same time since you have a AMD FX
6200 I'm not going to tell you to spend
much money on this platform but rather
upgrade it entirely to maybe a Rison
platform or a budget oriented Intel
platform because because yeah it's it's
really not worth spending too much more
money on this exact system I think the
case is still workable if you went with
like a budget Rison build you can easily
maintain this case because it can
support that 240 rad or is that a 280
red
it's a 280 red if it's an HH 115 oh yeah
it is 280 so yeah that's that's cool
honestly dude like I think if if you
wanted to upgrade to Verizon that's
probably your best bet
I wouldn't even invest in like cable
extensions unless you were first
planning to spend your money on getting
a better CPU and motherboard eBay heat
sinks on the memory I'm noticing here
that's eBay heat sinks yes Ram four by
four gigs crucial ddr3 at 1600 with eBay
heat sinks what does that mean I don't
know after my aftermarket heat sinks on
the memory and is that a thing if you
buy like generic green PCB geum-bun by
memory you can add some heat sinks on
top of possibly yeah
yeah I agree with most of the stuff Kyle
said you're looking at don't spend any
more money on this computer unless
you're upgrading this the core the core
platform new motherboard new processor
you're gonna need to swap that ddr3 for
some ddr4 your r9 390 you could you can
get a little bit more life out of I'd
say make sure if you're upgrading the
core components first you got what looks
like a pretty solid real tour Ryutaro
case here with plenty of space you got a
very nice liquid cooler yeah which would
be much better suited for a higher-end
CPU I think yeah and then of course
getting rid of the clear the clear LED
fans
we would also I think recommend as well
but it and I would I would point out as
far as cable management the USB cable
that's coming off of your water block
for your CPU is kind of distracting
because it's one of going underneath
your GPU maybe if you could route that
up top where are the other cables from
that water block are going I was gonna
say Ramat you've got a weird twisty
thing going on here with your with the
tooth of tubing here you might be able
to spin that 80 degrees or something
like that right just to give yourself a
a cleaner looking loop with that as well
yeah sense so yeah but I mean I don't
think your cable extensions look too bad
or anything like that so I'm gonna take
a stick with black and red yeah upgrade
some some of the components here and
yeah maybe get a matching graphics card
power connectors that go along with your
CPU and motherboard yeah okay let's move
on thank you very much next we've got
jelly raw lira jelly
yeah with the resin 7 1700 ROG GTX chase
tricks and in ASU's X 370 Prime inside
of an air 540 from Corsair okay so it
almost looks like we're dealing with the
same issue here with the tubing on your
arrow being a little twisted twisted
yeah so maybe I don't know I don't know
if you can somehow turn it rotate it you
know 360 degrees in one way or another
that it would would sort of even out it
what do you think what's better the
clean loop of the tubing or the Loko
being right setup what if you have to
choose between the two what do you go
for oh so hard man it's a hard choice it
is a hard choice I feel like I would
choose the tubing yeah to be honest I
would I would choose the tubing and have
the logo upside down like I can agree
with that I don't know and I feel like
there's maybe even easier ways to cover
up the logo then there is to mask the
tubing
twist eNOS yep so but it looks like you
know overall some pretty good pretty
good
hardware layout here I feel like custom
or sorry cable management can be fixed
up a little bit towards the bottom of
the case with maybe what's your HD audio
cable that kind of looks a little bit
loose
maybe tidy that up a bit obviously
custom extensions would do you a huge
solid here and it looks like some and we
absolutely have a computer off the floor
moment here computer off floor yeah
alright so you got all rant incoming you
got the bare minimum you've got at least
a piece of wood plywood whatever giving
you some separation between the bare
floor it's not good enough and the PC
but you're still really low to the
ground here and I would definitely
recommend raising this 10 to 15 inches
up off the ground to keep yourself from
accumulating too much dust too rapidly
other than that the cable management
stuff Kyle mentioned and I do be good ok
thanks Shelley Thank You Jenni next up a
final s1 this long back and last but not
least be a matte with a core i5 started
off with please ignore the nasty PSU
cables we will certainly not this is Tim
my PC we can't
yes it's impossible wait it's part of ok
show Core i5
8600 case 16 gigs of Trident zrg be EVGA
970 super clock with an msi z3z 370
gaming Pro carbon inside of a fan Tex
enthu Pro MSE great case
Wow geez those power supply cables man I
mean God why wouldn't you just tell us
to ignore those they look terrible
definitely get some extensions for that
or maybe just some full-blown cabling
cable mod does support that as well as
many other independent cable sleeper
cable sleeping companies remove that
power supply sticker please and cable
management if you like I feel like
there's a just a second look that could
be done at cable management here this
give me gives me the vibe of like a
system that was put together with kind
of the vague idea of where everything
should be connected up and then
everything was was routed to where it
should be and plugged in but you could
attack this again especially looking at
the rear panel there's just a lot of
loose cables hanging around so it could
be tied down it tied down a bit better
sure ends I think that would clean
things up a lot I would say consider if
you really go in the aesthetic route if
you're gonna go as far as like removing
the the label on your power supply maybe
also consider removing the label on the
on the SSD yeah that's facing out there
just an all silver face on that would
look pretty nice and then just some
simple black cable extensions you don't
even need to pay a lot for really nice
ones or whatever for your GPU and
motherboard and yeah if you've got a
real nice system everything is blending
pretty nicely as far as the base
hardware just just a few extra touches I
think they would we would clean things
up nicely yeah okay I agree with
everything Paul said thank you very much
Matt and that concludes it my PC yeah I
appreciate everyone sending in their
submissions there'll be a chance to do
that again next week perhaps let's move
on to our tech news and we'll roll
through this relatively quickly because
we're pretty light here in the day but
first off 4k Ultra HD monitors running
at a hundred and forty-four Hertz are
are upon us they are moments away from
being within our reach it's very
exciting we've been waiting for these to
actually hit store shelves for quite a
while now like two years two years right
and we've been waiting on DisplayPort
1.4 to deliver us deliver us this type
of bandwidth and resolution and finally
it's here according to tech powerup
thank you for the article these panels
will be coming to us this summer two
notable monitors come to mind the first
ones to arrive will be the 2018 Acer
predator X 27 which which is going to
feature a 4k resolution at 144 Hertz of
course
IPS quantum g-sync HDR DCI p3 color
space with
featuring 99% adobe RGB on a 10-bit
color display doesn't that sound nice
everyone doesn't that sound nice to come
with these cool little grim reaper hood
may or may not be included I would
imagine that it is okay and if that
isn't tickle your fancy there will be
another monitor that has pretty much all
the exact same specs that I just listed
off in the form of an asus rog swift PG
to 7uq so again you get all the same
features I just rattled and beautiful
beautiful little panel there before you
get too excited and this will kind of
break all of us right now and make us
cry a little these panels are expected
to retail for around 3000 USD ah that is
a lot of money it's expensive if you
thought you know the average 1200 to
1500 dollar price tag was was asking a
lot with the last generation of panels
or the current generation this is a lot
of freaking money for for a freaking
display yeah and imagine how much the
ultra woods are gonna be these are just
sixteen by nine panels so you know the
x34 equivalent of let's say 4k by 2560
or something like that it's gonna be
outrageously priced I mean those still
sell to some degree they want it to sell
as many monitors to make their margins
back because because those reasons and
and money but holy crap
I cannot believe monitors right now
Guinea monitors on the flagship side are
this pricey there's there's a lot of
speculation to that the reason these
monitors have taken so long to come out
I mean part of it is the the fabs that
make the panels themselves the fact that
these two monitors have the exact same
specs when it comes to resolution and
color depth and everything indicates to
me that they're probably sourced the
panel's of probably sourced from the
same fab but there's also the ability to
drive a game at 4k 144 Hertz which
wasn't really like there's been there
have been no massive updates in GPUs you
have past year year and a half since ten
atti came out right so there have been
no great improvements in the ability to
push this number of pixels at this at
this refresh rate so yeah just the fact
that nobody has a system that can
effectively make use of these monitors
right means that they're probably not
looking at a huge base of customers who
are ready to drop three grand on
something like this yeah but at the very
least you would be sort of guaranteed
that I mean this monitor like a monitor
like this would last you years to come
I would imagine because it would be
ready for the next and even like future
generations of GPUs that would be able
to push that many pixels at that refresh
rate or that frame rate so you know it's
it's sort of the you know how early of
an adopter do you really want to be if
you hop onto the bandwagon right now
then sure you're one of the first to get
it but you might not be able to fully
utilize it until a couple of years down
the line when when GPUs can actually
keep up with these demands but it is
kind of a you know that's that's what PC
gaming is all about is pushing the
envelope forward and sometimes you know
having so much performance that we even
you know more performance than we're
ready for at times but you know it kind
of comes with the territory when you're
talking about PC gaming but let's move
on here very exciting stuff
a black shark black shark is being
teased it's a blunt a brand new gaming
phone from it's a sort of a sister to
sister company but a smaller company
from xiao xiao xiao ming i don't know
how to pronounce it
where Xiaomi Xiaomi subsidiary shout
Xiaomi Xiaomi subsidary I hope I'm
pronouncing that right black shirt it's
like Razer it does it's very much like
the black and black and green sort of
highlighted
edgy gamer gamer istic aesthetic but
this company just teased their brand new
gaming phone right ahead of their April
13th launch which is in three days so
later this week this will be launching
officially the images that they've
posted not this one but the ones above
it the teaser images sort of hint at a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor at the
core of all this the media has been
reporting that we're gonna get it get it
to you by to ram at all
OLED screen with the fingerprint scanner
just under the screen dual rear rear
cameras with flash built-in GSM arena
shared the first live picture of the
phone which is what you saw down below
that has the sort of snap on back cover
which is which is thought so this is the
back of the phone we don't know what the
other side of the phone looks like and
most people are speculating that the
front of the phone that you don't see
here is actually gonna have some buttons
a button array and some joysticks maybe
a joystick or two four four four four
efficient gaming purposes so you could
actually use this as a handheld the
seeming demise is that this is supposed
to be I think so which which doesn't
that look very much like a joy con this
it looks almost exactly like a joy con
this looks like heard of the Nintendo
switch exactly yeah the the joy kind of
a Nintendo switch which looks yeah so so
I'm not sure if it's gonna be compatible
with a joy con or if it's just
coincidentally similar in design to one
of those Nintendo controllers but at any
rate this should be a one of the few
hardcore mobile gaming phones on the
market apart from the razor phone that
we've seen as of late last year so keep
your eye on that should be kind of
interesting to see how it unfolds
moving on here we've got an article from
hexxus duck net about Intel Intel and
their GPU that they're working on with
Raja Kaduri actually The Motley Fool
analyst us Ashraf
yassuh Ashraf Vyasa sorry if I'm
pronouncing that wrong he tweeted that
Raja Kaduri
who used to work for AMD but then quit
and started working for Intel there one
of their biggest competitors pretty
interesting that Raja plans to redefine
the company's Arctic sound GPU which is
Intel's very first discrete GPU yes if
you didn't hear this has been announced
already we've talked about this on the
show previously Intel is launching a
discrete GPU but up until now it's it's
just been it's been word that this this
GPU is really gonna have a focus or an
emphasis on video streaming but now
we're learning that Raja is trying to
redefine the Arctic sound GPU to be
powerful enough to handle a gaming
environment and workload so Intel gaming
GPUs this until might happen discrete
graphics carry this that's an old-school
revolutionary this interface down here
no that's years and years old Paul it's
an Intel 740 chip this is a new
accelerated graphics port interface no
big news GP fake news Paul it's being
introduced I've heard it's you're
spreading cancer among the internet it's
way faster than PCI Express you're wrong
everything you just said is wrong it's
got a VGA port look at that look at the
PCI Express it's gonna be jporten
look at the look at the PCI Express slot
it's like it's like hardly hardly Martha
for access the resurgence of analog
analog output people like that natural
color reproduction the d-sub will
prevail say it's like using it it's like
using it to bampi and it's got this warm
face warm feel we're using a ribbon a
ribbon style microphone just can't
compete so guys don't get too excited
right immediately this is gonna launch
probably in 2020 this will be Intel's
12th gen graphics architecture that we
made us not see for the next few years
but it's kind of exciting that in a
world currently or in a market currently
that has slim pickins for GPUs that are
readily affordable that we do have some
more competition coming
the market for for gaming GPUs so very
exciting stuff there ml let's move on to
our next article from WCC F Tech about
the RX 560 X this is the AMD Radeon card
or Polaris refresh card that was spotted
recently on 3d marks database via
overclocked 3d they were the ones who
found it first
according to the article and the actual
rx 560 X was particularly found inside
of an Acer laptop that was paired with
horizon 520 500 which indicates that
this GPU is aimed at the mobile market
at least for now and features the same
specs as the card it's replacing which
is the RX 560 now the RX 560 as we all
know it was the successor to the RX 460
so this is kind of like a rebrand of a
rebrand it's like rebrand ception or
refresh section whatever you want to
call it so you know AMD just needs to be
rinse and repeating this particular type
of GPU the arts 560 X it's not uncommon
for not uncommon for AMD to rebrand
their GPU not uncommon two or three
times yes
and you know some people are gambling oh
cool new GPU not really kind of sort of
the RX 560 is gonna be sporting the
Polaris 21 GPU and it's gonna feature
slight clock speed gains and efficiency
improvements over its successor the RX
500 X cards have not yet officially been
announced by AMD this has just sort of
been what's been discovered and looked
at from other resources it's gonna be
launching soon however as an annual
refresh to team Reds graphic graphics
lineup the new family will be the third
to feature the Polaris architecture
that's been used in the Radeon as I
mentioned before the RX 400h 509 X
series the clock speed is 73 megahertz
higher than the rx 560 M the mobile 560
putting it at around twelve hundred and
seventy-five megahertz it still has a
thousand and twenty four cores four gigs
of gddr5 on a 128-bit memory interface
and that's of course with a 1200 to
expand
have an issue with this it's just that
they they take pretty a pretty standard
progression of a mobile branding for 60m
updated to 560 m now it's a 560 X which
seems like the the product name of a
discreet graphics card it really does
and it's kind of its kind of deceiving
right it's not but that's not what it is
yeah they should call it the 560 X M
yeah there should always be an M keep a
mobile in there if it's um if it's made
for mobile because now people who don't
really know better are gonna buy a 560 X
laptop for example thinking that it has
a fully desktop size or desktop model
GPU in there when it's really just a
mobile chip
exactly and that acceptive that's very
deceptive so always always check the
benchmarks first before you buy
something like that but that's that's
all for that article and moving on we
have our last piece here from ARS
technica about a mysterious Google
branded 4k Android TV dongle that showed
up at the FCC the FCC sort of show this
to us earlier it's an HDMI dongle that
runs Android TV it comes with remote
kind of looks like a next-gen chromecast
or something like that look kind of like
a fire TV stick from from Amazon kind
like a competitor to that we have no
information on it other than what's been
revealed in the manual of this product
that says it's featuring the quad core
am logic s 905 X SOC and two gigs of RAM
with eight gigs of storage it also says
in the myth
manual excuse me that it supports
hardware decoding at 4k 60 frames per
second from h.265 and Google's very own
in-house vp9 codec there's no mention of
HDR support in the manual however other
manufacturers have already claimed that
it does support HDR 10 which is sort of
the most common HDR spec / standard that
we have on hand at the moment the remote
itself has a pretty conventional layout
you know all the buttons that you might
expect for a device like this including
the Google Assistant button so you
probably have some voice recognition
there
there might be a microphone built in the
into the remote we're not sure
and right now the only other
google-branded specifically Google
branded Android TV device that we have
currently is the the we cast Nexus
player the Nexus player was known for it
definitely had some ups and downs it was
known for being slightly underpowered
and left something to be desired in the
performance realm but you know you know
hopefully this device is going to
replace that one in terms of being the
flagship Android TV sort of portable
device and I think Google i/o the Google
i/o event is next month which I've never
been to a Google i/o I'm sure it's fun
Google i/o maybe one day I want to
finance it phonetically Google i/o
perhaps at Google i/o we will hear more
about this mysterious Android TV device
I've never used Android TV and that
never device and I've never used a
chromecast what's the difference between
an Android TV device Android TV it's its
own you lied to my understanding and
Android TV platform is its own UI it's
its own sort of like mini operating
system whereas a chromecast is more
you're just sort of windowing content
from your mobile device to your TV it's
just sort of like a window that you're
able to weigh exactly you're just
relaying it whereas Android TV is sort
of like okay you know maybe we're like
is that what is that what the Nvidia
shield uses shield is an Android based
Android based but it's not Android TV
right
I always forget what would Android
shields right it would make sense of it
I still don't fully comprehend what all
Android TV is yeah I don't know Paul and
I are both for the most part cord
cutters we don't watch too much TV and
deal with many times I see we go to like
the website yeah we usually just go
straight there to stream from Amazon
Prime Netflix or HBO go HBO go yeah or
we've got the TV tuner that we good you
know you can get HBO you can have an HBO
subscription through Amazon - now
did you know that HBO Showtime all that
shit you can just have it all three
Amazon now fucking geniuses fewer sites
you have to visit like I have I haven't
Amazon Prime to and I can I can like
yeah grab two at which thing but I
haven't done that either yeah
twitch Prime and all that jazz I should
so maybe we'll take a look at one of
these googly devices on our channels
relatively soon depending on if they're
if they're even worth it but for now
that concludes just just from chat
shields can do android TV functionality
okay many people saying that thanks okay
chat thanks jack for confirming that so
yeah very different than Google
chromecast which is just sort of reliant
on your your mobile devices interface
how can we doing content good alright
what's um let's talk about some
donations here to take your questions
thank you very much cell for curating
the list here
abstract once again thank you so much
for the hundred dollar donation you are
freakin boss I cannot support what you
guys do you disgust me
you guys only make me semi erect you
know if yeah sort of a be it's not like
ramrod Street it's it's not it's not
just drooping down one of these days
abstract I will turn your frown upside
down I mean this is a veiled don't tell
my wife this is a veiled compliment
though obviously obviously he has a
love-hate relationship with us you know
we you disgust me
but like he can't stop watching yeah you
know yeah it's like a guilty pleasure is
that's the feeling I'm getting you've
got problems abstract you should
probably see your therapist but
definitely continue giving us come back
next week yeah we'd love to have you
back master Pink's $5 next time they
need to send you
corked beers for added entertainment
just saying no terrible idea
stop giving the audience I have Kirk de
beers lined up for next week then you
can open all of them also thanks for all
you guys do you're welcome thank you
mister you're welcome
anytime bro bazinga X $10 here's your
money
will not be able to watch the whole show
to fall down the steps and need to take
meds and go to bed though well it sounds
like a topsy-turvy and I hope events
were effective I hope you slept well
yeah I'll watch the show tomorrow you
guys are great and I wish you a glorious
day today since you're watching this
tomorrow it's today for you it's the
future
thank you bazinga the future IRA Shh
$5 with the mood to 4k monitors have you
heard any rumors that DRM will allow
streaming content to go to 1080p for
browsers besides Internet Explorer I
have not heard anything like that to be
honest it's primarily a Netflix thing
and I've only barely interacted with
that at this point yeah so I need to
look at that for for for better than
1080p streaming content right because
yeah it will be a question as 4k
monitors and especially 4k TVs 4k TVs
are very reasonably priced now as long
as you don't need OLEDs yeah I'll have a
reviews $5 thank you sup guys USB 3.1
type C expansion cards worthwhile to
speed up large file transfers from
Galaxy X 9 or pixel - cheers guys yeah I
mean I don't see why not the one thing
I'd be concerned with is what the actual
maximum transfer rate available is on
your phone itself right because if your
phone can't can't deliver those
throughput speeds then no amount of
connectivity or what's the read speed of
the internal memory on your phone
exactly yeah I would expect it to be
faster than do you think it's 10
gigabits per second oh no no probably
not so maybe maybe USB 3.1 genuine but I
don't know about Gen 2 if that would
actually make a difference that you got
video I would expect it to have roughly
the same read/write speeds as like a
solid I say sorry SSD so maybe in the
400 to 600 megabytes per second range
so I've always had very slow transfer
speeds with dumping files for my phone
yeah for my even for my pixel my pixel
first-gen I haven't really done with too
much with my second chance or something
I on the same I haven't really seen much
much like hands-on testing with like
yeah I'm different phones and seeing
what their maximum right copy off of
transfer rate is true but that's kind of
a niche thing I guess but yeah I mean
yeah I mean El Jefe to get back to the
the fundamentals the essence of your
question if I will that's the nice thing
about building your own computer and
building say a full-size computer with
some expansion slots is maybe when you
built your computer you only had USB 3.0
you know paltry five gigabits per second
and now you can probably drop into one
of your PCI Express slots an expansion
card and upgrade yourself to the new
standard
so yeah let's know what you find man I'd
be curious to know myself Tronics gaming
dollar versus sorry
words sure noxus gaming $20 no comment
thank you very much to noxus I
appreciate that the junkman 1991 $5 what
gtx 1080 or what 1080 should i get for
my next build the asus 1088 gigabyte ROG
Strix or the gigabyte gtx 1088 gigabyte
g1 gaming you can't go wrong either way
man honestly yeah you're gonna be happy
with either of those cards they've been
very well reviewed
she's which one you think was better
yeah secondly like if you already have
an asus strix motherboard then getting
that graphics card might make them
aesthetically match a bit better and you
could also use use the asus or a
software to control the RGB lighting on
all of them at the same time well if you
see my boards I'm gonna used Oris same
thing if you've got a gigabyte
motherboard then maybe it might make
sense to go with the gigabyte graphics
card so you can sync them up but
functionally really
fine he's not gonna be much of a
difference either way yeah Adam Alki
with the 10 bucks hey Kyle so I live
like right across the LM Center near
your P o box so I guess you look near it
I'd love to meet you and I do
photography I would love to take some
pictures for you and your social media
that is very very kind offer Adam I
typically don't need too many pictures
of me taken for social media usually a
phone works just fine and I feel like
the more professional the photos the
less genuine or authentic they come
across with the you know on social media
it feels a bit more staged Adam now
Kyle's trying to say you're probably too
good you probably wait so you're
probably way too good for what I would
need I kind of like to keep things more
personal intimate but I do a pretty few
appreciate the offer
have you ever seen me roaming around the
streets of good ol LM give me a give me
shadow come up to me
say hi maybe we'll do a photo shoot on
the spot Adam follows up with another $5
donation and said Kyle notice the u2
dunes notice the YouTube dudes all these
homies homies be popping in chat what's
that mean oh I feel like I'm too old to
understand that language now is that the
YouTube noticed the YouTube dudes all
these homies be poppin and Chet homies
are friends it's probably a friends are
probably a photography photography term
pop it like poppin like like taking
pictures popping in chat we're taking
screenshots maybe I like popcorn where
yeah I could go for some pie were
enjoying a bucket of popcorn with some
friends notice notice the YouTube dudes
I agree yeah everything you said makes
sense
Thank You Adam thank you thank you very
very much
I like kitsune Mayo me too
$10 hey quick question any advice for a
really large Mouse Razer Naga is about
three inches too short and causes
constant cramping bonus points for side
buttons the more the better
oh oh it's large
I already know Talyn is this
it's what the Spada the RG father as a
wireless asus rog mouse that is the
biggest mouse that I've ever handled in
the last two years at least it is huge
I have average-sized hands I would say
and it's it's it's way too big for me
so maybe look into that it's wireless so
that might not be your thing
understandably so but it's worth
checking out if if you just have some og
man hands that can't find a good home
for at the moment I don't really have
any other recommendations for a large
Mouse I don't I didn't I was glad that
you had one yeah but it is a freakishly
big mouse all right let's move on to
thanks guy uh tighten heel bar H 20
bucks greetings new AG fam you know hey
that's our that's our slave name WH
warehouse one is still where the call
center is at lots of agents love using
gaming peripherals for work myself
included
rocking Logitech G 700 and a Corsair k70
luxe RGB keyboard try Lagunitas Waldo's
Waldo's special ale haven't tried that
one yet I'll keep an eye out for it the
Corsair k70 luxe is a very nice keyboard
that's the silver one with the white key
caps very rare hard to find in the u.s.
here so I guess you work at Warehouse
one or at least a new egg so awesome
yeah you are technically part of our old
family so when I worked at warehouse one
we would at lunch time we would get
lunch like it's ago or box lunch or
whatever and we drive up into into the
cemetery ooh
that's creepy I know that sounds Ken
weather but you do that because the
Whittier
what's the Scimitar cemetery called
right there damn it
my blanking on the name of the cemetery
you know what is called evil evil Grove
evil Grove
tombstones it's the cemetery it's on a
hill it goes up the hill and it's silt
it's a hill that looks over like Los
Angeles Hillcrest Hillcrest corpses Wow
is it in Cerritos no it's in Whittier
Whittier
with your shittier pine forest of dead
people that's am i close
no yes in fact close little warm
although the Ayers Rose Hills the the
decomposing body storage and central
mill he's fucking alright I'm gonna keep
going well you like that
Andrew SH wire thanks for the
suggestions but I may go for a look
ghost
s 1mk mark to do to wanting liquid
cooling Paul my PC has to be on the
floor cuz I have a small desk sorry get
a bigger desk there's no excuse so just
get something else that's not your desk
to put your computer out get an
extension of their desk do it thank you
very much for the five can maybe yours
Andrew and good luck at rescuing your PC
from the ground
medieval gamer 5 Australia's what's your
opinion on the new three Fran of three
fan Rose Hills Rose Hill Rose Hills
that's what I was gonna say next
medieval gamer five Austrians what's
your what's your opinion on the new
three fan crackin by NZXT I have not
checked it out yet maybe I'll do a video
on it on the channel sometime soon that
must be a 360 I'd imagine but the other
NZXT coolers have been doing really good
the Krakens I'm very happy with them so
I would imagine the three fans is not
too different but I can't really speak
until I tested myself Adam L Kyra once
again five dollars oh yeah I love the
content and you and the channel hope you
had a good time PAX East I had an
amazing time PAX East it was super fun
got to meet a lot of you guys actually
thank you all for coming up and saying
hi I know you guys can be shy sometimes
did you guys get snowed on or anything
um there was some snow on Friday it did
snow if like a couple hours but it was
really light snow so it would just melt
as soon as it hit the floor
it wasn't like building up or anything
but it was really nice just like seeing
snow in Boston was like who's so nice
and magical and stuff
but fortunately we were inside the
convention at that point just looking
out the glass panels so wasn't you cold
I should I should try to go to PAX East
next year I yeah we can all be on the
pen used to go with new egg and but I
always liked it I always thought there
was a really good crowd at PAX East yeah
it has that sort of nice fun young
energy there's a lot like more younger
people at PAX East than like Computex or
CES so like gives you a Gil it's you all
pumped up and stuff like yeah I'm all
energized in shit I've got got oodles
and oodles of energy to burn here but
thank you talking about Al's Rose Hills
super good thank you very much next
we've got Monica oh no sorry Braden
tuner Turner five two always what does
your guys thought on Mozilla reality
just Google it's virtual reality and
Firefox will it be a success or fail
we actually just covered this in the
last episode of awesome hardware I think
it was on my half and yeah I mean
obviously if you're looking to browse
the Internet in VR with a headset then
that's exactly what this is tailored for
and I haven't tried it out personally
obviously but I think that it's the
direction that we're headed people are
some people are super into VR and they
want to do every single thing imaginable
within that ecosystem and I think you
know Firefox isn't wrong for trying to
or I'm sorry Mozilla isn't wrong for
trying to capitalize on that I have to
try it first hand to really be sure if
it's if it's if it's if it's if it's
good or not but I think VR and the
various application surrounding it are
still very much in their infancy so it
might be a while until the browser
experience is perfected
I think browser browser ring or web
browsing in VR or the headset is very
difficult because there was a lot of
little links and little text that you
have to read and click on that can be
difficult especially when the resolution
for a lot of headsets even like the HTC
vive pro well it's been much improved
upon in the last couple of years isn't
quite fine enough to what you would see
on a regular desktop monitor or a laptop
screen to really be super precise and
allow you to click on those things very
easily so I think it's going to take
some time maybe several years until the
browser experience is polished enough to
warrant a more mainstream
use but I think it's definitely a step
in the right direction for that niche of
user Matic Ogden for these seven dollars
and forty or 7.47 New Zealand cents New
Zealand bucks
awesome show as always guys have a 1080i
with a seven seventy six hundred K at
five gigahertz is it worth going to the
8700 K no probably not no sorry I didn't
catch your site live Paul I have to try
harder in the future try harder mag duct
Maddock try harder
I am I was initially disappointed but I

sure that would do well maybe I'll do it
just just for the views that's all I
care copy company tighten heel bar at
each $10 cemetery skull Rose Hills Titan
here bar you - you didn't need to donate
$10 we discovered that but thank you
wait yes thank you thank you yes sir
Rose Hills you know if you know mines
being amongst dead people did deceased a
nice place to drive up and chill and eat
your lunch it never bothered me
it's very demented cuz he cuz like orbit

want to eat next to it just it's just
you're just taunting them you like look
haha mmm mmm this tasty I'm sure is good
it's so great to be alive yeah Wow
I bet you miss bologna sandwiches dead
person that Brown boy 3.75 dollars I had
a rise in 1600 ever clocked to 3.7
gigahertz and I noticed I was losing
frame rates any reason why that happens
happens
Brown boy 3.7 chances are you rise in
1600 has the feature called xfr extended
frequency range which means that for one
or two of the cores of threads on the
processor it can actually overclock
beyond even the base and boost cloth
that are listed by the manufacturer like
out of the box so whereas you might be
overclocking all of your course to 3.7
gigahertz without doing any overclocking
and just leaving it everything at the
base out of the box frequency you might
get xfr speeds I'm one or two cores that
are say 3.8 or 3.9 gigahertz and the
video games that you're playing are
probably more susceptible to that higher
frequency on one or two cores than they
are with the slightly lower frequency
across all the cores so it's definitely
been my experience with Rison processors
that overclocking for unseeing what you
can get on all cores is useful but often
it's the case they're just leaving
things at stock and going with the xfr
speeds for a couple cores will get you
better performance while you're gaming
do some testing that'd be my guess
a B comparisons are the best bet and
then finally we have kitsune mo once
again $5 surprised you got the name
right anyway the mouse has an optional
wired mode I think this is the same guy
who asked about the about a large Mouse
recommendation oh yeah I did recommend
him the asus rog Spada so there you go
yeah you got a wider wired option too
excuse me
so that yeah you you have much less than
you see that way we have a final
donation before we move on to our emails
ciarán Roxburgh with $10 Canadian hey
guys and
looking to build a high tier PC this
summer only downfall a $1300 1080 TI
should I wait for a price drop no rush
other than my fingers melting from the
heats of my gaming laptop I would wait
yeah 1080p is should be 500 bucks less
than that yeah and it's a it's a
reasonable guess that we might see GPU
prices drop in the next couple months
yeah
so yeah if if you're okay as is then
it's worth your while to wait a little
bit look for a used deal online - that
might help you out okay
okay last but not least um this is the
last message don't donate anymore anyone
