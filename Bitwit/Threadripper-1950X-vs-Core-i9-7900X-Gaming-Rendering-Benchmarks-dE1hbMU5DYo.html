description for more info what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well if you're watching
this video at the time of upload it
means that 2 SKUs from thread Ripper
have just launched the 1950 X and 1920 X
as part of the high-end desktop rise and
family from the folks at AMD we're going
to be taking a close look at the
flagship model the 1950 X the 16 core 32
thread parts more specifically we're
going to be pitting it against the
competing thousand dollar CPU which is
the Intel Core i7 7900 X both of these
CPUs are a thousand bucks so if you have
a cool grand that you're just waiting to
throw at a desktop processor here in
2017 those are your two options so we're
going to be doing a battle of the
thousand dollar CPUs today to sort of
celebrate this kick-off launch Ivan
right in let's take a look at some of
our specs side-by-side between each of
these CPUs again 16 cores and 32 threads
with our 1950 X whereas our 7900 X gives
you significantly fewer cores and
threads for the money 10 cores and 20
threads still no slouch it's definitely
the most cores and threads we've seen
from Intel at $1,000 to date but it
still kind of pales in comparison to
thread Ripper but we'll see if that
actually makes a huge difference when it
comes to workstation applications and
gaming performance on our 7900 x we get
a bass and boost clock of 3.3 gigahertz
and 4.3 gigahertz respectively with a
4.5 gigahertz burst which is basically a
part of the max turbo Technology 3.0
from Intel which will take its favorite
core or sometimes more than one core I'm
not sure at least one core and it will
spike it up to four point five gigahertz
assuming that you have power and thermal
Headroom we've also got three point four
gigahertz and four gigahertz base and
boost respectively for our 1950 X part
with a 200 megahertz X if our boost so
potentially up to 4.2 gigahertz assuming
you have the
headroom thirteen point seven five
megabytes of l3 cache on the intel side
32 megabytes of l3 for thread Ripper and
one of the biggest differences that's
most talked about between these two
chips and the platforms in general are
the PCIe gen3 lanes so we've got 44 with
the 79 hundred x and sixty-four PCIe
lanes with the 1950 X in fact all of the
thread Ripper parts that have been
announced so far are sporting 64 PCIe
gen3 lanes we've also got a big
difference in TVP 140 watts on the 7900
X and 180 watts on the 1950 X we'll see
if that actually equates to a big
difference in thermals once we put a
load on each of these systems lastly we
have both camps supporting quad-channel
ddr4 memory it's worth noting that all
of the SKUs in the thread Ripper family
are supporting this whereas only skylake
X parts are going to be equipped with
quad channel support when it comes to KT
like X for example you're going to be
limited to dual channels so if you're
buying a motherboard that's not
specifically tailored for Kb like X then
you will not have access to some of your
memory channels in fact half of your
DIMM slots will not be usable so bear
that in mind
testing hardware on on the on the test
beds we've got the 7900 X being cooled
by a corsair h 110 i which is a 280
millimeter AIO that's on top of an MSI X
299 gaming Pro carbon motherboard with
32 gigs of G scaled tried NZ ddr4 at
3200 megahertz
we've also got an Asus Strix GT X 1080 P
I which is rocking right out of the box
speeds no overclocking involved here
just the factory OC that it ships with
and that is the same GPU we're using for
both systems on the 1950 X rig we've got
that being cooled by an Envy xt kraken X
62 which is also a 280 millimeter liquid
a oh that's aboard the asus X 399 zenith
extreme motherboard along with 32 gigs
of g-scale tried NZ RGB at again
3200 megahertz and we were able to hit
those speeds on both of those kits
no problem within the BIOS now of course
before we dive into the benchmarks just
a little bit of testing methodology for
y'all just so you know exactly how I
went about this for our 1950 X I ran all
of our tests with SMT enabled so the
full 16 core and 32 threads are being
fully utilized or have the potential to
be fully utilized for all these runs
within the UEFI I was able to hit an all
core overclocked to 4.0 gigahertz at one
point three nine volts I would have
liked to go further than four gigahertz
or at least try to but after checking my
thermals I noticed we were already
hitting a max core temperature or max
package temp of 79 degrees Celsius so I
didn't want to run the system any hotter
than what I would feel personally
comfortable with my own system at home
so that's why I left it at 4 gigahertz
you might be able to find some higher
clock speeds than that on other review
sites and youtubers but that was what I
got we were also again able to hit 30
200 megahertz within the UEFI I was
using the latest bios at the time which
was BIOS 0 3 0 5 that was again on the X
30 99 zenith extreme and within Windows
I was using the high performance power
plan for the entirety of my tests now
along with thread Ripper comes some
changes within the rising master
software as well so in particular we've
got two different modes on one hand
we've got creator mode which is
recommended by AMD for workstation
applications and productivity apps
things of that nature and then we have
gaming mode which of course is if you're
going to be firing up some games
the main difference or one of the
primary differences between these modes
is the memory architecture that they're
using so in creator mode we're actually
using Yuma which essentially utilizes
both of the active dies on the CPU as
well as both memory banks all at the
same time it sort of just sprawls out
like it's full utilization across the
entire CPU whereas Numa in gaming mode
pretty much only utilizes one die and
the memory bank it's attached to before
it gets filled up and once that's at a
hundred percent load it starts tapping
in to the other die and its associated
memory bank that's a very high-level
explanation of how it works but the end
result is that AMD found that by using
the Numa memory architecture and gaming
mode that they were able to yield about
4 percent better performance on average
after testing a hundred different games
as it turned out in my testing I did not
see any difference whatsoever in
performance when gaming in either
creator mode or gaming mode it didn't
really matter what I was using
and again this is only because I was
testing for games as opposed to a
hundred that's obviously a much larger
sample size so if I would have branched
out my my benchmark suite to include
more games I'd probably start to see a
little bit of a performance benefit from
from having gaming mode enabled but
since I did not
I simply tested everything in the
default profile that Raisa master comes
with which is creator mode because again
I saw zero performance difference
between each of those either of those
modes in our games so for the 7900 X
let's move on to that hyper-threading
was enabled it's got to be a fair game
so if SMT is enabled on thread Ripper
hyper-threading should be enabled with
our Intel chip I was easily able to hit
an overclock of 4.5 gigahertz across all
cores at just one point two volts
actually fairly low which could
partially explain why our Mac's package
temperature was much lower than that on
the 1950 X only 60 degrees Celsius for
our 7900 X that was the max load
temperature we saw on the package after
the duration of my testing which is
fairly good that's 19 degrees cooler
than the 1950 X again could partially be
explained by the fact that I dialed in a
fairly modest OC for 7900 X I've been
seeing a lot of people hit 4.8 gigahertz
and Beyond on all 10 cores which could
explain why we're seeing a lot of people
complaining about you know skylake x
overheating but not in this case memory
again was set in the bios to the rated
speed of clearly 200 megahertz with the
XMP profile and we were using the latest
bios as well at the time of filming for
our msi x 299 gaming Pro carbon
motherboard a final note before we dive
into the benchmarks I decided to run all
four of our titles today at various
resolutions so we're going to be testing
at 1080p primarily to expose any sort of
CPU weakness or bottleneck by taking
pressure off of the GPU and then also
1440p and 4k because I figure most
people who are buying $1,000 cpu for
gaming are probably going to be gaming
at resolutions beyond 1080p unless
they're trying to hop on that 144 Hertz
bandwagon we'll talk a bit more about
that later on after we see the results
so on that note ladies and gentlemen the
moment you've all been waiting for
here the
marks for our $2,000 CPUs not $2,000
CPUs but these two $1000 CPS I'm sure
that was obvious
whatever
all right so ladies and gentlemen that
is all the data and now we should
probably talk about it
so when it comes to productivity editing
and rendering and you're strictly
getting down to business we kind of saw
the two CPUs trade blows the the 1950 X
definitely had an upper hand in hand
break when we were encoding our 4k 5
minute clip the 7900 X in that test took
about 22% longer to finish its encoding
than our thread Ripper contender
whereas in premiere we actually saw the
Intel chip pull ahead the 1950 X took 12
percent longer not not quite as big of a
lead for 7900 X here but it did take
longer to render that 4k file out what
it came to workstation application
specifically overclocking seemed to help
both camps quite a bit in handbrake we
saw both of the CPUs gain anywhere
between 10 to 15 percent when
overclocking which is pretty impressive
and in premiere overclocking gave both
of our chips a performance increase of
17 to 19 percent so definitely
overclocked if you're gonna be buying
either of these CPUs especially your
going to be using it for workstation
stuff which you should be then
overclocking can help quite a bit
let's talk about gaming really quick at
4k as expected the CPU is a pretty much
neck-and-neck
we're not going to see a huge variance
in performance between the two simply
because we are now severely GPU
bottlenecked
and because of that this is pretty much
a wash when it comes to 3840 by 2160 P
and 1440p however we start to see the
gap increase the average FPS of our 7900
X they are 26% better or higher than the
1950 X and that was across all four of
our games that we tested overall which
is pretty significant 26% higher average
frame rates at 1440p interestingly
enough at 1080p
we saw the exact same result with a 70
900 X again scoring 26% higher average
frame rates over the 1950 X as an
overall score for our four titles tested
so what I would conclude here is that if
you're spending a thousand bucks on a
CPU primarily for gaming and your
below 4k then you definitely want to go
for the 7900 X because it will just give
you consistently higher performance
overall especially if you are one of
those 14 forearms sorry 144 hurts gamers
at 1080p and you have a 1080p display
then the 7900 X is probably the best but
is definitely the best bet because you
know both CPUs provided an outstanding
experience when gaming I mean I had a
blast gaming and playing around on both
platforms however if you are trying to
chase that framerate
you will be getting more of more frames
per second with the 7900 X again at 4k
doesn't really matter anything below
that 70 100x finally wrapping up with
some closing notes here I just want to
reiterate that with thread Ripper you do
get more PCIe gen3 lanes out of the gate
with the 1950 X or any of the thread
reproduce for that matter than you do
with Intel this is a big deal a lot of
people are really hyped up about it this
is going to give you more flexibility to
do things like multi-gpu setups combined
with nvme storage and things of that
nature
however recent news has just brought
confirmation to us that at launch you
will not be able to boot off of nvme
raid array with thread Ripper this is a
support that AMD may potentially add in
the future but we don't have a date on
that
whereas with Intel you get that support
right out of the gate and ultimately
it's going to be up to you as to how
important that feature is on a final
note I know I've said this a million
times as well as other reviewers out
there but Rison really is still maturing
it's so new the Zen architecture is
still fresh in its infancy whereas you
know Intel has been around for so long
developers have been optimizing for for
Intel alone for so many years now that
it'll be interesting to see after
there's more optimizations made for
higher core count CPUs if we could
potentially do a rematch between these
two CPUs later down the line let's say
six months to a year from now just to
see if AMD has gained any leverage over
Intel in this particular segment it
would be really fascinating to me
personally but that's of course a topic
for another video so you guys have all
the information now it's out there go
ahead and watch all the other reviewers
all the other youtubers who are talking
about the 1950 x and thread refer and
comparing it against Intel the more
information the better but as always I'm
very curious to hear your own feedback
and thoughts on this launch in the
comments below so blow it up guys let me
know what you think about all this crazy
stuff and until next time toss me like
on the video if you enjoyed it it helps
me so much and before you guys go feel
free to check out bit wit ultra my
