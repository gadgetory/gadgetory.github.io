other day my own wife challenged me to a
cable management 1v1 showdown so here we
are the audacity of this woman what
prompted that anyway cuz I think I have
better cable management than you decide
what it is you know I'm glad we have
that on now I'm glad we're recording
that so we can play it back after I beat
you I hope you don't lose cuz it'll be
really embarrassing it'll be way more
embarrassing for me to lose right just
to make things as fair as possible
obviously I have a bit more building
experience than you but we are using an
identical set of hardware pretty much
straight across the board I think with
the exception of SSD in memory because
those don't really matter but yeah
pretty much apples to apples hardware so
you wanna list off the components really
quick sure for this sex we're using rice
and CPUs we have an azrog a.m. for B 450
motherboard 16 gigabytes of RAM a r8
spire cooler in our TX 2080 founders
Edition will each have an SSD and for
the case we'll be using a Corsair spec
for yes I intentionally picked that case
out because of well it's more or less an
entry-level case and so the cable
management in it isn't stellar challenge
yeah it makes it very challenging
there's no power supply shroud there's
very minimal space between the back of
the motherboard tray and the right side
panel and so forth so it should be
interesting and finally we're using a
non modular power supply also my idea to
to make things extra fun for us and then
we also have rules because we're not
animals so it's gonna be 15 minutes
we're gonna 15 minutes to get the job
done essentially and all the components
are pretty much gonna be pre-installed
with the exception of the GPU and the
SSD because it's gonna be up to us where
we want to mount the SSD there's a
couple different mounting locations and
there's a drive cage with three trays
and there's also two mounting points at
the back behind the motherboard tray so
that'll be completely up to us and then
GPU will want to wait on that because
depending on where you plug in your SATA
cable it might be easier to do that
before a GPU installation also we can
use a total of five zip ties they can be
any size we have two different sizes
large and small you can mix and match
the sizes but you can't have more than
five total that being said we can use
the pre-installed zip ties there are a
couple of pre-installed zip ties there
in the case those are completely fine if
you want to leave them alone you can
if you want but it doesn't grant you any
additional zip ties if you do there's
also twist ties in the case that we
cannot use we have to remove the twist
ties we can't leave purpose them in any
way additionally every single cable that
can be used must be used and if if it's
not by the end of that 15 minutes then
you incur a penalty and we'll get the
penalties in a moment additionally if
you can't put the right side panel on
relatively easily or if it's just not
going to happen that's also a penalty
against your final score
so speaking of scoring let's talk about
how this is all gonna get judged we're
gonna have three judges for today the
first one is the one and only Chris who
is also our camera operator for today
Chris is a special judge because he's
gonna be the only one today who actually
gets to see our work in person so his
opinions gonna be very important our
second judge is our Twitter followers
we're gonna do a Twitter poll and
they're not gonna know whose bill does
whose so it's gonna be a blind vote and
then finally we're gonna have a
celebrity judge our good friend Paul for
Paul's hardware he's actually gonna
weigh in and and he's you know he's he's
an expert builder himself so very
important to have hanging boards why I
don't see I'll say he's not gonna know
who's build is who's either you know if
he did he probably would choose yours
clearly hates me each judge cast one
vote of course whoever has a majority
vote wins the contest however for every
penalty you incur you get minus one vote
against your total score all right so
could essentially put you out of the
game and that's pretty much it I think
we covered it so are you are you are you
ready okay good luck to you good luck to
you good sportsmanship I like it you
guys need it bad sportsmanship that
quickly 180 all right let's go it's on
are you ready honey yeah I'm ready all
right let's get all of it I'm gonna
start the timer count us down Chris
oh okay
I think I'll install the GPU first that
sounds like a great idea well I'm not
giving up any of my strategy so you do
whatever you want I don't want your
crappy strategy anyway what my Togo you
having problems over there pal no oh now
we didn't discuss this deal all four
screws have to go in there sis t just -
let's just do - all right - what he is
installed either the rush
sounds like I hear some struggling over
there honey
I just didn't realize there's so many
screws on this bracket for the GPU oh
wow he's got a bit overwhelmed it's just
annoying that's all
I already have my GPU and SST installed
babe how about you I'm not saying
anything
go away everything's fine you're
stressing out over there nope
oh my gosh I actually perform better
under pressure
unlike some people I meet you
good
damnit definitely got the better of
Squire cutters
oh my god ouch what's happening
seriously okay
oh that's rough
there's no way babe I don't know if we
really gave ourselves enough time to be
honest well sounds like a personal
problem he's damn zip-tie holes on this
case they're so thin it's like threading
a frickin needle you can't even use the
Lord as if touch oh my god really
3-minute warning so my strategy is not
to be perfect it just needs to be better
than holy crap that was hard that was so
much more challenging I thought how'd
you do honey oh I can't touch anything
okay so this this is my build it's not
up to par with my usual quality of cable
managing but I did the best I could in
the allot of time that I had and I think
I did pretty good all things considered
you know I've got to I've got the excess
cables I didn't use nicely zip-tied at
the bottom of the case I didn't have
time to quite make this 8 pin EPS cable
as neat as I would have liked to
obviously with the case not having a
cutout in the top left corner of the
motherboard I had no choice but to sort
of run it across the mobo there you can
see I actually opted to mount the SSD in
the lower tray just to be able to hide
some of the cables underneath the cage a
bit more effectively there's actual kind
of weird tie-down points here where
there's just two holes they're not
really traditional tie-down points and
the holes are very small so I couldn't
even use the larger thicker zip ties
that we have on hand but the smaller
ones that actually do fit are not very
long so I had a hard time I actually had
to go through one or two different zip
ties they kept breaking because they
weren't quite long enough to to fit all
these cables comfortably but I got one
of them on there
these were pre-installed from the case I
left those there this is probably the
the hairiest part of the bill down here
because that's that's exactly when I ran
out of time however I did get one last
large zip tie if you can look right
there pretty much tying down large bulk
of these cables otherwise the side panel
would probably have had a really
difficult time getting on that was done
at the very last second but there it is
the winning prize PC
I'm sure let's see how you did honey
yeah let's take a look come on he just
oh oh I got to see this no you
you've been talking up a storm so long
let me see what you did so I had a few
hangups
sit the obviously screwed me over
royally a few hangups
I started out installing the SSD
that was fine he went right here at the
top top cage yep and then I asked my
table moving it's fine it's all fine all
right so I have mrs. D installed I had
my GPU installed I was actually moving
pretty quickly but then when I was
putting the the bracket on here on the
side I had almost all my screws in and
then I realized I didn't realize how
loose these were and they weren't even
underneath the bracket wait why were you
worried about these ones these should
have never been uninstalled you said I
had to remove this entire thing no I was
talking about this thing to play yes I'm
coming now I thought that I needed to
remove all these in order to take this
off just when I was about to like make
everything look good the timer went off
so basically this was a cable management
challenge and I did sir okay management
yeah there's no way the side panel
spitting on that okay so that would be
one penalty and then do you have
everything plugged in I believe so your
8 pin EPS is good 24 pin check we do
have a front front panel connector is
undone there's one that's how they came
undone when it fell because I make sure
they're all plugged in before we so you
have one unplugged cable I didn't say
this earlier because I was trying to
look good but you actually notice that
one of my front panel connectors came
undone as well while I was in the
process of pulling the other cables
through the thicker cables through it
kind of just popped out with the other
ones and I was very confident that I had
all those plugged in as well so I would
suspect that your front panel connector
came out
before the timer was up I knew I was
getting a point docked with the side
panel not going on so I was really
careful to make sure they're all plugged
in I think the table collapses right
there
oh I don't actually think the system was
in frame let me double-check and the
handsaw oh I think this is one of your
front panel connectors it looks plugged
in which is the one that's unplugged
right now I think one of the power
top-left yeah see that looks it looks
like you might be good honey yeah I mean
I can't really see anything I can't say
yes or no okay we got to make a decision
here so because there's no conclusive
evidence that you fail to plug in the
connector before the 15 minutes was up I
feel like we should do the whole
innocent until proven guilty let's just
say that you only have one penalty
against you for not being able to put
the side panel on I think at this point
we should just let Chris administer the
other two votes to Paul and to Twitter
tally up the votes put it in an envelope
and then hand it to us we'll open it and
declare a winner so
okay let's do it let's do it good good
luck all right here we are
Chris do you have the envelope with the
results inside ah go ahead and reveal
the first vote one of the time Kyle
Twitter oh I won the Twitter poll one
for me you are fired
explain yourself yourself because on
Heather's it was our LED which is like
whatever it's like yeah it's not plugged
in but yours was the reset button
functional Wow you were really splitting
hairs
oh there's a second reason the cables
that because of you know the psyche
panel is not a tempered glass you can't
see it so it really doesn't matter if
it's messy or not if anything I felt
hers was easier to close than yours
because Brenda we're so flexible oh they
just lay flat anywhere they fit oh so
just don't do any cable marriage at all
that's it's the best chance you have of
getting your side panel on
yeah okay well you know we we did make
you a judge so that's that's our fault I
don't know if the last one is okay let's
see it is the tiebreaker this is for all
the marbles and and me voted for me
thank you Paul Paul's my homie so it
looks like I have two votes
why he has one and we both have one
penalty against us so majority wins
anyway looks like I'm the winner
yay hurray to me good job good job wifey
job - I think the rematch might be in
order I think that needs to happen
anyway thank you very much for watching
