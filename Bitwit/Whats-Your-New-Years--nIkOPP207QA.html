network hope you're all recovering
nicely from the holidays and time to
celebrate the new year because typically
the recovery period for that is much
longer and along with the new year comes
that one promise to ourselves which
molds us into better individuals our new
year's resolution but this year I'm not
interested in how much weight you want
to lose or how you plan to go vegan
without losing all your friends today as
we turn over yet another page in the
human race history books what I want to
know from you is what's your actual
resolution mine is 2560 x 1440 the
reason i ask is because i recently got
the idea to conduct a little experiment
you see after gathering all your answers
i'm going to put the data into a chart
so we can see where we all lie on the
resolution scale then exactly one year
from now i'll conduct the same survey
and compare the two charts to see how
the market has shifted then i'll do the
same thing the year after that and the
year after that and so forth hopefully
in time we'll start to paint a picture
of where the market is headed or at the
very least how fast we're getting there
with the pixel race phenomenon just
beginning to venture beyond the realm of
tablets and smartphones i'm curious to
see how long it takes us to deviate from
the everlasting 1080 monitor standard so
if you'd like to participate in my new
year's resolution recurring annual poll
leave a comment with the resolution of
your highest res monitor for example if
you currently game on 3 1080 monitors
your answer should still be 1920 x 1080
additionally only comments on this
youtube video will be sourced for data
so if you're watching this somewhere
other than the YouTube watch page cruise
on over here and leave your comment
below for your answer to be counted a
few days from now i will post a
follow-up video with a complete chart
giving our first glimpse of the
resolution trend for the start of 2015
and finally i urge you guys to share
this video with your friends and
families and encourage them to
participate in the survey to as a larger
sample size will give us a much more
accurate representation on the
resolution scale it also means i'll be
spending a lot more time compiling data
which always gives me such a rush i'm
just kidding it's ok it's it's for
science thank you all for being a part
of this poll and for passing this video
along it should be fun and if this is
the first time you're watching one of my
videos i invite you to subscribe to my
channel awesomesauce network for more
tech content in 2015 as my current fans
will tell you you won't regret some of
it all in all i hope you guys have an
awesome sauce new years with your loved
ones have fun be safe and as long as I
destroy my liver by the end of this
whole thing I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
