channel today is very special because we
are checking out a brand new product
from AMD actually a couple new products
from AMD this is their new line of ap
use advanced processor units which means
that it is a CPU with a built in graphic
solution actually we're using rx biga
graphics here which is very exciting
that that means we're gonna have some
low powered but pretty powerful at the
same time chips that don't need a
discrete GPU to run 3d applications like
your favorite video games for example of
course it's not gonna be quite as
powerful as a discrete graphics solution
but these are much more cost effective
and we're gonna take a closer look at
them next week when the embargo for
benchmarks actually lifts today the
embargo is lifting just for the unboxing
so we're gonna do an unboxing because we
can not necessarily because we should
it's just just an unboxing but we'll get
to talk about the skis that are in here
the different products and what they're
made of in just a moment here I guess we
could just sort of fire it off I'm gonna
we've got some multicam setups going on
today so you've got a top-down camera
there let's go ahead and rip the velcro
felt right now I got a level with you
guys I've actually already kind of
unboxed this because I've already
started my testing testing is underway
for this guy
so guys apologies in advance if you see
some of the packages have already been
opened first off we've got some nice
artwork rising powers right Radeon rains
you prevail and it's showing us the two
schemes that are included in this
package we've got a risin 5 for 2400 G
and an AMD risin 320 200 G we'll talk
about the specs on those in just a
moment this is again showing you that
we've got risin so we've got a Zen
architecture here 14 nanometer FinFET
process with Vega graphics built right
in now this is not to be mistaken for
rise and second generation these are
still rising first gen chips
however we are getting some some some
nice features that aren't found on 1st
gen rising that launched last year so
for starters this is what we've got and
let's let's start with start with this
this is a motherboard the Gigabyte
motherboard actually I'm gonna move this
aside this is the a be 350 n gaming
Wi-Fi let's take a look at the board
really quick you know I think that they
made an effort to to package it in here
let's take a look clearly I've already
unbought
this this is actually the board that I
used for my testing for the benchmark
video you see next week it will be
featuring this board it's a lovely board
lovely little mini ITX guy it's black
and red so hopefully that's that's a
color scheme that you're into but we've
got a Wi-Fi module it does have Wi-Fi
which i think is very important for most
mini ITX boards there's an m dot two
slot on the back which I do appreciate
so I mean really you can get a pretty
darn small case to fit everything inside
here with that m dot two slot and having
the graphic solution built right onto
the chip you could actually have a
pretty tiny little system whether it be
an HT PC or light powered gaming rig
does have a full eight pin CPU connector
that's good looks like you might be able
to do some some decent overclocking here
looks like we've got one two three four
five six MOSFETs there's a little
heatsink over that and four SATA ports
four SATA 6g parts a little light on the
fan connectors we've got one two fan
headers where's the second one second
fan header right there could have could
have used it a couple more fan headers
there but what can you do rear i/o again
we got the Wi-Fi which is lovely and six
USB 3.0 ports no type-c or anything like
that
no type-c on the on the main mainboard
either to DIMM slots and a full size by
sixteen PCIe slots so you can use these
CPUs in tandem with the discrete GPU if
you want to and we'll talk a little bit
about the possibilities there later on
but very nice motherboard but moving on
here we have a lot more to unbox
secondly memory the Flair ex-girl Flair
ex clerics is known for having extreme
solid guaranteed compatibility with the
am4 platform this is especially useful
and important when the platform first
launched last year because there weren't
a lot of memory kits that were validated
to work at the rated speeds but g-scale
brought it home with the Flair X this is
a 16 gigabyte kit kats latency 14 and 34
1.35 bolts and we are rocking the 3200
megahertz frequency that is lovely
lovely I actually memory is not cheap
these days so I'm glad sometimes the
manufacturers included with their
packages and then we have a USB stick
these aren't quite in high demand but
you
2.0 AMD branded USB stick I'm not sure
if there are drivers on it I don't think
so I think it's probably just blank so I
don't know I can do a naked bootable
disk or something like that later and
then we've got the good stuff our main
event horizon 320 200 G and 2400 G
horizon 5 I'm gonna I'm gonna unbox the
Rison 320 200 G first because I actually
haven't unboxed it yet you can see that
I've already broken the seal on the 2400
G this is the one that I have tested so
far and I can't say anything else about
that but stay tuned for actual benchmark
oh I keep saying that I need a razor
I'll be right back
I am so unprepared for this unboxing I
don't even have a razor what am i doing
I am a professional it's okay and do I
even do I even own a razor where did the
razor go I have a saw okay we're gonna
use we're gonna use Chris's student ID I
will make sure not to show them your
picture even though you look perfectly
fine and we're gonna open it oh wow but
just slice right through there thank you
very much Chris fun fact you can open
CPU boxes with credit cards and your
student ID multi-tool that's technically
a multi-tool all right so let's open up
this guy so Rison 320 200 G all right
we've got a fork or four thread part
here so no SMT again this is retailing I
don't know if I mention this $99 us very
attractive price point for 4 cores and 4
threads a basin boost clock of 3.5 and
3.7 gigahertz respectively as far as
cash goes we have 2 megabytes of l2
cache and 4 megabytes of l3 cache and as
far as the graphics solution the 2200 G
is fitted with Radeon Vega 8 graphics
and 8 also indicates the number of GPU
cores we have 8 GPU cores on this guy on
this little guy there he is
the IHS looks pretty much identical to
first generation chips that are already
available alrighty
and additionally we've got a clock speed
a graphics frequency of 1100 megahertz
and another thing
is that we have an included Wraith
stealth I think this is the stone I'll
put an annotation if I'm wrong it's
confusing but this is the little one
a little guy will race stealth here he's
adorable and looks exactly the same as
the existing units that shipped with
other select Verizon CPUs this is not
the one with the RGB ring and it's a
very important thing to point out for
some of you I does have a nice black
braided cable for Pete for pin pwm
connector at the end and pre-applied
thermal paste so you can choose to use
that for wipe it off and use your own up
to you but the other thing this also
brings up a good point is that this as
well as the risin 5 we're about to look
at have a 65 watt TDP so very power
efficient and they're not gonna really
expel much heat which means something
like this is gonna do just a fine job at
cooling it the other great thing about
these ap use is that they're fully
unlocked the multiplier is fully
unlocked and you can actually overclock
both the CPU and GPU portions of these
units which is fantastic you can do that
within Rison master the rising master
software from AMD i'm pretty sure you
could also overclock the CPU side
straight from the UEFI like you would a
traditional processor and that's the
Rison 320 200 G this is gonna be really
great for 4 HT pcs where gaming might
not be a central focus because the the
graphic solution on here is not quite as
powerful as the one found in the Rison
520 400 G which retails for 169 US
dollars so I'm gonna go ahead and open
up this guy and I've placed the CPU back
inside of the box to simulate a
authentic and pure unboxing I don't
really need to check out the race fire
again and honestly it's kind of a moot
point to show the CPU here because it
looks exactly the same as the one we
just looked at but let's talk about this
one what do you get for seventy more
dollars over the horizon 320 200 G well
for starters you still have the same
four cores but now we've got SMT so
we're getting eight threads which means
this is gonna do a finer job at
multi-threaded tasks perhaps games that
can leverage multiple
course and maybe a bit of light encoding
as well so for course eight threads
higher clock speeds out of the box as
well with a bass and boost clock of 3.6
and 3.9 gigahertz respectively and we've
also got again 65 watt TDP the graphic
solution is probably the thing that's
going to sell a lot of people on this as
well is that we're moving up from 8 to
11 GPU cores so this is using Vega 11
graphics and with that you also get a
higher clock speed on the graphics core
at twelve hundred and fifty megahertz
and again these are these are
overclockable figures guys we can push
this even further AMD was showing us
some pretty impressive numbers at their
press event few weeks back during CES
and that's it that's the chip I mean so
I mean you know pairing that with a
board like the one we have here you can
have a pretty compact little system they
didn't say they didn't say we couldn't
mount the CPU into the socket the
embargo does not specify that CPU
mounting was was illegal so guys finally
for the very first time we're gonna be
able to start using the video outputs on
these am4 motherboards all of us
reviewers kind of already knew that
AMD was gonna release ap use for this
platform because when the am4 boards
first launched we saw you know hdmi and
displayport outs and since there's no
integrated graphics solution on the
first generation chips that launched
last year we all kind of figured okay
they've clearly got some plans to make
some AP use and here they are finally
ready for launch it'll be interesting
come review day to see just how capable
these processors are first off for
starters I really want to see the
difference in graphical performance
between the horizon 3 and Rison 5 chips
here and secondly with GPU prices so
high right now people are gonna consider
buying these as a temporary stopgap for
for gaming purposes mostly I would
imagine until GPU prices come back down
but are these things gonna be able to
handle any sort of gaming experience at
an adequate and enjoyable level in the
first place you guys will just have to
wait for my review
and many others coming soon and yeah
very exciting stuff
I love APU I love small form-factor mini
ITX builds as most of you guys know so
rest assured we will be doing some major
testing with these some overclocking
with these and definitely some builds as
well so stay tuned for all that guys
that's gonna pretty much wrap it up
that's all I can really say AMD will cut
me off there so guys if you enjoyed this
video
toss me a like on it I do appreciate it
and it does help me a lot
let me know what you think of these ap
use in the comments below what your
expectations are what you think of the
price points again ninety nine dollars
and one hundred and sixty nine dollars
for the rising three and five chips
respectively and that is pretty much a
wrap for now guys so I think you might
very little to have that so thank you
very much for watching have a good one
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
