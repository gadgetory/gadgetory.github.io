of the new year and all I guess it's
really no surprise that I'd be doing a
year and recap and this is always a fun
kind of video to make because it lets me
reflect on all that's happened with the
channel since january first 2014 and at
first i was like well not much has
really happened since then but after
digging into the awesomesauce archives
it was fascinating to see how much
actually has happened and how much
things have changed for me since then
and many of you have been with me every
step of the way so so here it is join me
now as I take a trip down memory lane
with my year-end recap of 2014 I started
the year off pretty strong at the time I
was only posting about one video a week
because I was still working full-time
for newegg but somehow I was still able
to produce episode 2 of system config
with Jenny and shooting that video was
admittedly more fun than building in the
in win 90 for that case was a piece of
work in march i co-hosted the sexy
four-way give away with paul from pulse
hardware dimitri from hardware Canucks
and jay from JS two cents and that was a
lot of fun as well I love doing collab
videos whether it's just giving away
free stuff or getting straight up dusted
by Austin Evans yeah that video was
pretty hilarious I remember Paul calling
me and being like hey man I got Austin
Evans inside my house you want to come
over and look at him with me so I
cruised over and got the idea to do a
video basically making Austin out to be
a scary get a white guy he was basically
mmm just having him make death threats
and use ebonics I thought was hilarious
because he's such a nice and educated
guy we'd be filming and he'd be like I'm
a smoke you fool you best watch your
back and then we'd yell cut it he'd be
like do you guys have any iced tea but
yeah I mean for being such an impulsive
video it was a lot of fun to shoot and
he was obviously really great to work
with a week or two after that I attended
Coachella which is an annual music
festival it was a fun filled weekend of
camping watching musical performances
and lots of beer pong that's probably
why my next video did an air till about
three weeks later and I was episode 3 of
system config with Jacob who was a
professional producer in the film
industry in need of an editing
workstation like really badly needed one
I was really happy with how that one
turned out it felt the most cohesive out
of the three it seemed to flow a bit
better than the others and I think
seeing such a huge performance gain from
his old Mac Pro really added to the
excitement of the show
about a month later I was on a plane to
Asia to shoot some videos for a new egg
we had stayed in Shenzhen China for a
few days and then headed over to Taiwan
for computex this was actually my second
computex except this year I was
basically there as an editor so I didn't
even get to see the show floor instead I
was in the hotel room all day every day
stitching together footage that the
shooting team would drop off at random
intervals but despite being in a room
all day I still got to enjoy Taipei a
bunch of us actually hit up the guanghua
digital district which is a massive six
floor building filled with kiosks
selling all tech things from CPUs two
video cards that's where Paul and I
picked up a bunch of LED strips for
about a quarter of the price you'd find
them here in the US I also got to
revisit some of the nightlife there that
i had been missing since my last trip to
taipei it was a really great experience
but about halfway into the trip we've
got a call informing us that one of our
close friends and industry had passed
away she was actually exhibiting at CES
and I had plans to shoot a video with
her the day after she passed so it was
just a devastating blow to the team and
there was a somber feeling in the air
for the rest of the trip but we all miss
in love her dearly Elaine you're the
best upon returning home I needed a fun
project to keep me distracted from the
grievous incident back east so I took to
upgrading my trusty sandy bridge system
most notably the cable management was
quite a Bismil my first time around so i
redid that whole mess and made a few
other upgrades like swapping out the
liquid cooler installing a fan
controller LEDs and reorganizing my
drive layout the system also got a much
needed cleaning in the process so that
was good the fun continued once I got
the idea for nature tech a stupid parody
where I talked about the gtx 780ti as if
I were narrating some kind of nature
documentary if you haven't seen it don't
it's ridiculous when we get into July I
wasn't really doing much except oh yeah
breaking a world record yeah highlander
was so much fun all of us tech tubers
met in colorado and climbed a fourteen
thousand foot mountain played OG doom at
the top and got accepted into the
Guinness World Book of freaking records
for the highest elevated land party
quite an accomplishment for a bunch of
nerds who just spend most of their time
at a computer but I mean yeah hiking
that mountain was by far and away the
most physically demanding thing I've
ever done and at the same time probably
the most gratifying one to have
accomplished me Linus and edzel were the
first ones down the mountain so we kind
of just
killed in the car while the rest of the
crew unbeknownst to us was dodging
lightning bolts and fearing for their
lives so the trip could have really
turned out very differently had someone
been fatally overvoltage but fortunately
everyone made it out safely so it was a
fun trip overall shortly after
Highlander i started a recurring Q&amp;amp;A
segment called answer me damn it as a
new way to interact with you guys and
answer frequently asked questions that
warranted more than just an explanation
in a simple comment reply so I've only
done about to amd's since then but the
third one is already in the pipeline and
I'm going to try to make this a monthly
thing for 2015 August marked a brand
refresh for the channel when I made the
decision to change the channel name from
awesomesauce news to awesomesauce
network because you know the channel
name wasn't already long enough I was on
the fence about the name change for a
long time so I finally reached out to
you guys and that really helped me make
what I think was the right decision for
the channel so thank you the
long-awaited haswell-e yes that was a
big one I spent a lot of time at Paul's
house prepping my three-part build
series for the big launch we stayed up
pretty late getting our video shot Paul
made spaghetti and I could taste the
intelligence by the end of it I we both
produced a lot of successful content for
both of our channels which was quickly
followed by yet another huge launch in
the industry the gtx 980 and and for
that i remember not having any time to
shoot a proper review that week so i
didn't did another parody video that
made some people laugh and pissed off
everyone else who was expecting a
legitimate review but i still liked that
video it's awesome the end of September
brought about a huge life change for me
when I quit my day job at newegg and
moved in with my grandparents to pursue
a future dedicated to this channel it
was easily one of the most difficult
decisions I've ever made and honestly
there are still days where I
second-guess myself about it but you
guys are always so quick to remind me
with your likes and your comments that
what I'm doing is right and that with a
lot of hard work I'll eventually get to
where I want to be although apparently
one life-changing event per year just
isn't drastic enough for me so about a
month later I got engaged me my friends
and my girlfriend at the time went to
Hawaii to celebrate mine and another
friend's birthday and while we were
there staying in Oahu I popped the
question and thankfully she said yes or
else the rest of the trip would have
been really awkward we laughed we cried
we've logged it was a delightful
experience I'll remember for a lifetime
honey I love you more than anything in
the world
and I look forward to spending every day
with you unless there's a big product
launch coming up then you know I got to
work but afterwards we can regroup and I
love you finally for the last few months
of 2014 I've made an effort to post at
least two videos a week consistently
just to keep the content flowing and
I've also just begun to really nail down
the style of my reviews getting all the
crucial information in leaving the
trivial bits out and adding in some
comedic flare when I can these last few
months have also shown me that I'm
showing me what I'm capable of now that
I'm able to focus entirely on the
channel and still I tend to set very
high standards for myself and I'm not
anywhere close to where I'd like to be
but seeing how far I've come in one year
since january first 2015 looks like it's
going to be filled with many more
achievements for awesomesauce network
and that my friends I think wraps up
this year and recap so leave me a
comment letting me know what your
favorite awesomesauce video or moment
was of 2014 have yourselves a fun and
safe new years everybody don't forget to
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already and I'll see you guys next year
that's like it's tomorrow it's not like
a whole year that's like a few hours
pretty close</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
