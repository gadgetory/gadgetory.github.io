news welcome back this is part three of
my HTPC series and in the first two
videos I basically parted out the
components for the system and I showed
you guys a time-lapse video with some
commentary of actually building that
system but so now that in this video I'm
actually gonna be showing you some of
the performance and really just how I
have it set up in my living room right
now as you guys many of you guys know I
moved to a new place here it is check
out them digs so we've got a beanbag got
a couple couches in there a couple cats
laying around just ruining everything
it's it's a great it's a great place to
be and there's the other one but
basically what I'm here to talk to you
about today is the htpc of course and
right now I have it connected to this
beautiful LED TV it's an LG it's a 55
inch and it is LED LCD look at how thin
it is it's probably just over an inch
thick it's got plenty of inputs and
right now the only thing connected to it
is this htpc but it's pretty much the
only thing that we need it to be
connected to I mean this thing's got as
you guys know already it's got a blu-ray
player it plays games I even have the
Xbox 360 wireless transmitter right
there so I can play games with my Xbox
360 controller
and that's actually been working out
beautifully I'll show you a little bit
of that in just a bit I also have my 2
terabytes Seagate hard drive connected
to it I had to buy the enclosure
separately the enclosures from Rosewell
I did a kind of a review slash overview
on that it's more of an overview
actually you can check that out if you
want but that's been working out nice
that's kind of where all my storage goes
if you want to know the model number for
this TV let me actually bring it up on
the screen here take a look at the model
number 55
LM 4600 it is a 3d LED TV it's 55 inches
1080p the LG is advertising it as 120
Hertz it doesn't there it is honey 20
Hertz but it really isn't exactly pure
120 Hertz it's more like 60 Hertz that's
kind of just a branding thing that LG is
doing that's their true view or their
true cinema version of refresh rate what
they do is it's something called black
lighting where they actually dim the
frame very frequently rapidly so you
don't really see as
motion blur so it's it's kind of false
advertising but I still haven't noticed
any motion blur either when watching
movies or playing games on this so far
so it's been it's been a really good
panel for me thus far and I got a super
cheap on new egg it was on sale for like
seven hundred bucks
it was an amazing consumer electronics
blowout sale a couple weekends ago so I
pulled the trigger on that but that's
been working really nicely with with
this system here and if you remember
correctly it's it's rocking a
GTX 650 Ti boost so that's been more
than enough to do some 1080p playback as
well as some 1080 gaming on this guy so
aside from that I know I know that you
guys really want to see the temps for
this guy because had some had some
discussion earlier and in past videos
about how the temps would do I was I was
trying out a particular cooler the
Samuel Samuel 17 for the first time and
it's actually doing fairly well these
are the idle temps this is just an image
that I took a screencap I took of the
temps at idle just about Oh 20 minutes
ago so you can see there the maximum
temperature was at idle is 40 degrees
Celsius on core number one and if you
guys care about the GTX 650 Ti
temperatures it's 37 Celsius and that is
the EVGA superclocked Edition now if you
want to see the load temperatures over
here I've been playing Borderlands 2 for
the about the past half hour and so
there you can kind of see the max temp
is 56 degrees Celsius still fairly
chilly and the Mishima caught the
graphics card the 630 ti boost got up to
74 still very reasonable especially for
being such a small form-factor case like
I said earlier it's got a lot of
ventilation especially on the side there
you can see it's just got plenty of
breathing room for that video card so
it's going to be in taking a lot of
fresh air and ejecting it pretty much
out the back since that is a fairly
enclosed enclosure on that video card
and you've also got some ventilation up
top for the power supply as well this
thing has been working beautifully for
me we've watched a ton of videos on it
already played a bunch of blu-rays we've
been streaming Netflix been playing some
games mostly Grand Theft Auto 4 and
obviously just a little bit of
Borderlands earlier but so far I've been
very happy
performance let's talk about some of the
peripherals that I'm using in tandem
with the HTPC so this is a candy board
from vision tech that I actually won
geez I guess maybe last year at our new
egg company picnic believe it or not and
I think I mentioned this in one of my
earlier videos
hold on the cat sir cats are fighting
I'm sorry I need to I need to just show
you this really quick I'm easily
distracted or do playing or just okay oh
oh oh here comes the karate kick oh oh
we're going for it
Jesus you guys are vicious because
you're animals anyway so this is the
candy board it's working really well it
works off of a RF RF transmitter it's
actually plugged into my htpc right now
up top and this is really nice because
just super portable fits in the palm of
my hand
it's really nice also because it is LED
backlit I'm not showing it right now but
as LED backlit so it's great for when
we're watching movies in the pitch-black
dark I can see exactly what I'm typing
it's very handy now for more intensive
purposes I have this keyboard right here
right over here this is a Logitech I
forget the model number of this guy but
it's got a really nice trackpad I'll put
the model number up in the video right
now
and you can take a look at that but this
is really nice the only thing that I
wish it had was a LED backlight it's not
LED backlit at all so but that's why I
have the mini keyboard there on hand as
well so and obviously it is much larger
than the candy board that I have but it
is also much nicer to type on because it
is a full QWERTY keypad that I don't
have to use just my thumbs I can just
type like a regular keyboard and it
works beautifully aside from that what
else did I want to say oh yeah this
keyboard is also very user friendly it's
very it's very friendly with Windows 8
which is actually the operating system
that I'm running the HTPC on I don't
know if you guys can tell I actually
installed these shell third-party
software to create the Windows Start
button so I have a Windows Start button
in Windows 8 which is always nice and it
does boot straight to the desktop so I
don't have to deal with any funky Metro
UI greeting me every time I turn the
system on
but everything is working beautifully
like I said this is very user friendly
to Windows 8 it's got a lot of Windows 8
shortcut keys as for the function button
so you can see there's like the charms
bar and search and the Metro UI button
so it's a it's actually a perfect fit
for this type of configuration aside
from that I also have the xbox360
controller as I mentioned earlier that
is being used in tandem with that
wireless receiver over there and that
receiver is really I mean it's dirt
cheap I think it was like 10 or 11 bucks
you can probably find them even cheaper
I think I just got like a knockoff
no-name brand and it's been working fine
and let's see what else oh yeah I guess
just a reminder of what's in the system
itself as far as storage goes oh let me
let me fix that for you
just to just to show you guys right now
in my C Drive my main drive is a 240 gig
SSD is a Plextor m5 that's the only
drive in that system right now and then
of course that external Rosewill
enclosure it's got a 2 terabyte Seagate
hard drive in there it's filling up
pretty nicely I still have some room to
go before I need some expansion I think
eventually I will probably get a nasa up
in here so that my roommates and i can
just drag files put files on it
communally and we can just share them
across the network that we have here but
that's I think that's pretty much it
guys oh yeah I did want to show you
quick little quick little Borderlands
special here here's my controller and
I'm going to resume and kill people this
is actually super awesome I'm not used
to seeing I'm not used to playing a game
on a TV and the graphics looking this
amazing so I'm very very excited and
this 650 ti boost is handling the crap
out of everything I throw at it so far I
haven't done any like hardcore Crysis 3
gameplay or anything like that
but from all the games I've been playing
like saints row you know all those
controller friendly games it's been it's
been working beautifully and I'm about
to die so I do something ballsy kill
people but if you guys are curious to
know what the performance is like on a
gtx 660ti i also did a video on
reference 650 TI boosts I should say TI
boost to be specific you can check that
video out I also do an SLI comparison in
that particular video so go ahead and
watch that if you haven't already and
that's pretty much going to conclude
this video guys I hope you guys enjoy
this this HTPC series that I've been
doing it's it's been a lot of fun and I
want to do more stuff like it's more
hands-on bills as well so let me know
what you guys think about my little
configuration here if you guys have any
suggestions of what other things would
be cool for me to install on my HTPC in
this living room that I have here and
that's pretty much it thank you guys if
you enjoyed this video please like the
video it helps a lot
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
