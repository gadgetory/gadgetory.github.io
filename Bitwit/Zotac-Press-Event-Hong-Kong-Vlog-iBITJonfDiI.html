going to start with me in Hong Kong at
my hotel on the way to a press event
celebrating the 10-year anniversary of
our friends over at ZOTAC they called me
out over here to Hong Kong because it's
their birthday that's their tenth
birthday there's still there's still a
little babies but they are going to be
showing off some really cool stuff in
celebration of their birthday including
some new products that you guys might
find interesting so we're gonna get go
ahead over there oh and on top of that
they're also hosting the World Cup for
csgo so they pulled a lot of the pro
gamers from around the world there's
Japan Korea US Europe and all of them
we're going to be competing for I would
guess some kind of cash prize or maybe
just bragging rights which is also very
nice so that's going on as well so after
the press conference the embargo of a
lift and I'll be able to tell you all
the nice things that zou Tech is coming
out with either later this year or early
next year I believe so why don't we go
ahead and take a look at their showroom
because I know there's a lot of demos
and cool hardware going on over there
all right so just getting things started
with the big guns right here this is the
geforce gtx 1080 as a stamp extreme yes
it is the amp extreme look at how
massive this is this is the biggest
video card i've seen in a long time
check out the finn stack on this bad boy
sweet mother of god so you get dual
eight pins PCIe so a better stability
for overclocking might actually even
land you a few extra megahertz on the
GPU four o'clock triple fan fans err got
a pretty cool design again with the
carbon fiber that so tech has been known
for in recent years get some RGB LEDs
with our spectrum lighting software very
nice wrap around get a wraparound
backplate again with this freaking
heatsink it's a it's pretty beefy I
think I counted about six six millimeter
copper heat pipes there let's see what
the specs are here so again GT X 1080
sorry I'm an autofocus 2560 CUDA cores
of course base block of seventeen
hundred and seventy one two a boost of
nineteen hundred and eleven megahertz
pretty sure this bad boy can hit 2.1
gigahertz no problem but I'd probably
try that out to verify first let's see
what else you've got here the ek
and ice cream cooling system all that
good stuff I pretty much cover the rest
of course the the fans the fans will
freeze go to zero rpm if it's the GPU is
under sixty degrees so that's nice
working our way down the Shelf here
we've got two gtx 1060 s that were
checking out here there's one over here
which looks a little bit more in the
basic side kind of a no-frills design
it's got a single fan that's blown down
on a heatsink
you get 1 6 pin PCI connector which is a
reference reference style no backplate
or anything like that this is a 6 gig
model however so you will get that extra
vram that gddr5 over here we've got
another gtx 1060 however this is what's
a little bit nicer I would say it's got
better better cooling setup it looks
like it's got two fans instead of one
it's also got just kind of a nicer
looking design looks like a little bit
higher quality again you do get the same
6 pin PCI connector very nice looking
from the front it's pretty color neutral
so it matched a lot of cases black PCB
as well that's nice get your heatsink
open-air shroud looks like a couple
couple copper heat pipes in there as
well video outs are pretty much standard
that's also reference let's take a look
at the clock speeds here so again this
is a 6 gig version as well with a base
clock of 1556 megahertz boost of 1771
versus 1700 and 8 on the boost on on
this on this other card here so
definitely this is probably the slightly
faster slightly more expensive version
but looks pretty sweet so this is
perhaps the newest addition to the zotac
line of graphics cards this is their GTX
1050 Ti I like how many it is it's
pretty much the the cooler extends the
exact dimensions of the PCB itself so
it's not going to be any more than six
or so inches which is gonna be really
great for small form-factor
we could go great with in something like
the note 202 or or similar it's got a
single fan which is actually fairly
large it looks like that might be a 100
or he sets of 100 millimeter fans no
PCIe connector here so this is going to
be more of the the basic reference style
design in terms of the cooling and power
delivery which is a gonna mean you're
going to be able to get all your juice
straight through the motherboard PCIe
slot 75 watts to be exact
not
too shabby actually got a nice like a
plastic enclosure here it's a fairly
nice design and hopefully hopefully it
runs pretty quiet as well far as Mexico
you've got a bass clock a thirteen
hundred and ninety two megahertz with a
boost of 1500 and six seven hundred and
sixty eight food of course of course
everything else pretty much standard you
get the same four gigs of gddr5 at seven
gigahertz on a 128-bit bus with a
display for 1.4 HDMI 2.0 P and dual link
DVI so also these video outs are pretty
much the same as they would be on the
reference design as well from Nvidia
which which is which is pretty which is
pretty okay with me I don't think many
people are going to be connecting more
than three displays at a time to this
card although the display engine does
support additional panels but that's
going to be have to be something in the
future that we see from a board partner
like ZOTAC alright so you guys might
recognize this little PC here because
I've actually talked about it before at
Computex earlier this year they had a
demo of this but it was a fully
transparent chassis so you could look
inside and the first thing that you
would realize is that it was completely
custom water-cooled everything from the
CPU and the GPU all done from the ground
up by ZOTAC was freaking water cold so
this is the Magnus Ian 980 so it's got a
GTX 980 it's all Maxwell and old and
stuff however so tech is going to be
releasing some very promising news about
an update to this particular particular
model that you guys might find
interesting so stay tuned for that
alright guys so so tech has just
concluded their press conference here at
the hotel and they've announced three
big new products that I think you guys
are probably going to get a kick out of
so why don't we go ahead and take a look
at those three options and see what they
have in store for us
mini pretzel alright so here it is guys
this is the Magnus en 1080 and this is
new product number one as you as a name
might suggest you could probably infer
that this has a GTX 1080 and at full
desktop GPU inside of a very slim or I
should say small form-factor kind of
cubish in shape and design but it does
have a really nice look to it it's all
black it's got some nice ventilation at
the top and look at this you've got LEDs
on the front on the side kind of got
some nice 10-year anniversary branding
there these are RGB LEDs I believe
there's configurable in the spectra
software which is kind of nice I'm sure
you can also disable them as well so
it's not too distracting look at this on
the front panel you get HDMI autofocus
HDMI for a VR HMDs which is super cool
also USB 3.1 front panel both type a and
type C connectors and an SD card reader
moving around to the back sexy more
ventilation look at all the outputs you
get four USB three they also get two
DisplayPort 1.3 and two hdmi outs dual
gigabit ethernet lan Wi-Fi and bluetooth
this is new products number dos you can
see it's got a GPU water block on it
courtesy of Thermaltake they've slept a
custom one on here for the ten-year
anniversary
it's got RGB LEDs of course all around
the edges again you can configure that
in the spectra software you do get dual
a pin connectors right here for added
power very nice backplate on the back as
well on top of this you're also getting
a 16 phase power design so it's going to
help you better regulate any kind of
power delivery that you might have at
higher clock speeds which is always nice
to see additionally here look at these
Gina quarter-inch fittings there and you
can put whatever fittings of course you
like on there I believe you can swap it
to either side so you can have your pick
on how exactly you want to configure
your inlets and outlets here also dual
BIOS on this thing and the cool thing
about this dual BIOS is that you can
actually switch it either hardware or
software based so you there's I believe
there's a switch on the board itself or
you can hop into the firestorm program
and configure it and switch it off that
way so you have kind of a gaming mode
maybe a backup bios for whatever
settings overclock settings or tweaks
that you want to put on it so the cool
thing about this graphics card is that
it will come included with a very
special limited edition sli high
bandwidth bridge from zou tech it
actually looks really nice I personally
like the minimalistic design that
they're going with here but on top of
that if you did want to pick one of
these up they will probably be available
in December but you're gonna have to
pick them up quick because these are
only available in limited quantities
it's probably also going to cost you
nominally just an and winding down the
new products that so tech has announced
at their 10-year anniversary event is
the VR go backpack now we actually I got
to demo this back in Computex earlier
this year and it's changed significantly
since then you can see it's no longer
just a simple like fabric and mesh
design it's it's completely enclosed in
like a hard shell case which is I think
fully I believe is made of plastic which
helps helps it be a little bit lighter
and also more durable as well I was kind
of one of my concerns with the with the
fabric was that how how is that going to
hold up wear and tear over long over the
long periods of time but I kind of like
what they've done here of course that is
gonna add a little bit of weight to the
equation so I believe it's weighing in
at around 10 pounds so based on I don't
know just how how much tolerance you
have for for back strain and what game
you're playing I think that could
severely impact whether or not that's an
issue for any of you look at that
holsters now that was not there in in
Computex as well you get two holsters on
each side I think so you could have one
vibe controller on on either side and I
believe she she is holding the the hmd
there but there's also a hook that you
can suspend it on when you're not
actually actively gaming which is kind
of handy also there's a video outputs on
the top and I believe on the side so you
get either configuration whatever is
more convenient to you you can have your
hmd coming out either or there's also
lots of ventilation again going back to
the back of the case here which is going
to be better for airflow and
temperatures and things like that
now there's also I believe that's a
battery life indicator LED that I can't
imagine what else that would be if you
look over there to the left of on the
left side of the case is a hot swappable
battery so I believe they said it takes
about two hours to charge it and then
you get two hours of playtime so if you
have two or three of these battery
you can pretty much just play
uninterrupted continuously without ever
having to really stop your gameplay
which is really really cool that's not
something that they had completely
ironed out yet at Computex so it's nice
to see these additional changes and
finally I don't know if we can get a
good b-roll shot of it later but oh
there it is that you can see some some
cabling some excess cabling so while
this does provide a very nice untethered
experience for you and your hmd there's
still a lot of excess cable that can be
lying around that you might have to find
a place to talk tuck up or is if tie
together velcro strap it so there's
actually a little little area on your
utility belt here that allows you to
stash all that excess cabling so that's
that's really nice - all right so this
is the final freaking round of the
entire world cup here csgo we got BG
cyber Zen from China versus splice
splice needs one more round if they win
this round they win the entire
tournament so uh the crowds pretty on
edge at the moment TV oh God
TPS to put one guy left attendee Oh
speaker
big toys disco suit right Wow that's it
fly swings flies for the win
Congrats guys alright time for dinner
look at this meeting PC it's actually a
cake someone messed it up already
very sad we're on a shuttle now everyone
at the event is on their way to China
we're going to cross the Hong Kong
Chinese border got our visas ready we're
going to the donut factory tour rizzo
attack of course where we get to see how
GPUs are made we're going to get to see
all the ins and outs of where ZOTAC
makes most if not all of their hardware
like graphics cards and that probably
would include like the mini pcs and
stuff so does your boot cool alright so
we have just got off the bus and we've
stopped for lunch before we actually
head to the factory we're at this a
fancy hotel a I don't know the name of
it we just kind of ended up here but
it's Japanese Japanese restaurant check
this out yeah
that's real mother of God there's one
like every two feet I don't know I don't
know which one do I do
which one do I eat both why can't it be
both
did I mention it's buffet style ah come
on come on you got to be you got to be
kidding me right
you'd really good oh come on oh stop it
come on come on really oh my oh oh
cheesy Oh what what is that yeah I'm so
full
I'm never eating never English again
we're here now at the factory Kesey
partner is the name of the adding boards
supplier for companies like zou tech and
a bunch of others so pretty pretty big
name around these parts in mainland
China oh I think I think we're getting
lab coats or those are some anti-static
coats the latest is the latest trying to
look so hip I'm gonna start building my
pcs in these coats know you feel really
good so fly right now
what your pointy cute where'd you get
those right there right here on here oh
my god I'm scared oh my god oh sorry
all right other one not yet all right
here we go again oh my god that's
amazing
this is the coolest thing I've ever seen
low-key we look pretty fly though here's
some factory workers hard at work
watching the machines closely making
sure that they don't become self-aware
and take over the world
this guy's job is the exact opposite of
mine he's a professional boxer and there
they are the finished package can I have
one of those just just maybe one or two
no okay all right so the GPUs are pretty
much all built they got their shrouds
and coolers on them looks pretty good
now that's a time for testing there's
got to test them out if it shows up with
a signal of some sort some kind of video
output like that one over there was just
doing then I believe that's a pass and
if not then they I don't know throw them
in the garbage or something ooh this one
this one made it to the BIOS I'm pretty
sure that one's good so apparently this
is where all the best jobs at so tech
are in this room here where you get to
actually test the cards by playing games
it's about a four-hour run to determine
whether or not a GPU has passed or
failed so these guys just a game they
get the game all day playing overwatch
on big screen TVs and stuff you know and
get paid doing it that's pretty awesome
this is the fan testing room everybody
this couldn't tell so this is the dust
testing room where they actually
simulate a worst-case scenario and they
introduce a lot of dust into the room
and see you know if the component fails
or not
pretty much
I probably shouldn't open the door that
they probably shouldn't do that yeah my
testing room pretty epic pretty cool
though there's a double door here
insulated we're going into the anechoic
chamber where they do the acoustics test
this is gonna make me really jealous
because uh all the acoustics tests I do
at home
pretty much over overridden by bike
traffic outside my window this is really
weird I can barely like yeah it is it's
incredibly quiet in here almost too
quiet it is really weird like it's
almost kind of kind of year any plane
right yeah no I thought like I wasn't
hearing for the factory tour is over and
we are now hitting the streets at night
in Hong Kong we're back in Hong Kong we
made it back safely from China we didn't
go to prison it's awesome now we've been
led by one of the locals to this place
called Delaney's which looks like an
irish pub okay it can't get much more
Chinese than that
all right so a rule of thumb for me when
I'm traveling abroad is always go to at
least one really nice restaurant just to
experience some of the fine dining in
culture you're not familiar with so
we've found our way here to Ming's Court
which is actually got a Michelin star
under its belt I haven't been to too
many of these types of restaurants but
so far the food has been amazing this
just rolled out BBQ pork this is one of
their signature dishes and I'm about to
eat it so I'm gonna stop going now all
right so the zotac event as far as we
know is over and they've kind of led us
on our own we're just running wild here
in Hong Kong so we had to switch hotels
because there was no way we were paying
for that nice s place for an additional
two days here so we got a hostel this is
the first hostel I've ever stayed at it
actually it's the first hostel that any
of us have ever stayed at and this is
our room we're in room number five but
this is the room there's there's a bunk
bed and there's that's where the room
ends this is it there's there's two bunk
beds
luckily the bottom one's a little bit
bigger for for me and wifey sauce now
gets the top bunk and in a bathroom
it'll tell you this bathroom the
bathroom is actually integrated with the
shower itself the shower faucet is right
there that is efficiency innovation that
is space maximization it's it's pretty
impressive I'm excited I can tell how I
was excited try to try to contain your
excitement a little bit honey you know
you're gonna love that shower you know
it's a little bit off you're gonna wipe
the out of the shower but this was
in our budget and hey at least there's a
see there's a nice a/c unit it feels
pretty good
we got everything we need just this is
the life let me tell you this is this is
the the hallway to our hostel it looks
like from the movie hostel poor horse
saw this is pretty look at the walls
here could use a paint job maybe just a
bit
it is another bright beautiful sunny and
humid as hell day here in Hong Kong we
have found our way to the Kowloon Park
which is a pretty massive property here
that's right across the street from our
hotel it's like a three-second walk and
my wife spotted this aviary sign she's a
huge huge huge bird fan for some reason
so she immediately ran up the stairs as
soon as she saw this so let's go ahead
and check it out what do we have here
look at that look at the bed $10 to the
white man I think I picked that one food
for the supper we eat you for breakfast
I'm continuing hungry hey don't turn
your back on me I make it come pouch
chicken out of your eye here would you
like to come with me another man I know
a man who who would love to love to meet
you his name order the Colonel Sanders
show me your faith show me your faith
why you coward why you carry show me
your feet I bet that bigot a stray or
nine now we go to Beijing poem Tang do
this energy drink slow cow it's like Red
Bull but instead of a bull it's a it's a
lazy cow how awesome is that
mind cool a honey get down from there
get down from there right now you're
gonna hurt yourself
it's dim-sum time we are eating all the
things homes
so far everything's really really really
really good this place is called dim
dimming some this is the best thing I've
ever eaten in my life
all right so we just took a stroll
through that park over there kind of
embedded in the midst of all these
buildings and we're headed somewhere
over there you can see some white tents
all popping up
that's a Food and Wine Festival it's the
wine and dine festival it's an annual
thing that happens in Hong Kong as the
name suggests food and wine we're gonna
we're gonna check it out even though we
just ate dim sum this is all we're doing
on this trip is eating eating way too
much apparently this is one of the
largest if not the largest festivals in
Hong Kong that happens annually
according to someone who works here so I
have in fact checked that at all but
it's a pretty massive event we've walked
for like I think it probably takes you
an hour to walk around the entire thing
once if you weren't stopping at any of
the booths so there's plenty of stuff to
try out here regardless of what you're
into you'll probably find something that
you really enjoy it's really cool
because they've got Europe here too it's
not just Hong Kong stuff they got Europe
Austria land I had an Australian beer I
had some Riesling which was a really
nice German wine a lot of good stuff
here I think the last thing I'm going to
spend my token on is probably some good
old scotch I can find some nice Irish
whiskey and that will probably seal the
deal here I think at that point we're
probably gonna go look for some dinner
maybe some some a hotpot Szechuan sounds
pretty tasty so yeah pretty fun last day
if I do say so myself so Kyle got
stopped for an interview and I was like
whoa I'm gonna go vlog I'm out of here
and then Heather sat down next to him
and she got approached with some with
another interview and I'm just I'm just
standing here laughing my ass off
Heather's like I'm sorry this is this is
all in Chinese I don't I don't really
know what this character means all that
it means you sell your soul to Chinese
prison you come work for us for free for
for all eternity I just sign your name
right
you make sure to sign in blood and in
what color today
we go get a beer while those suckers
answer questions
come on pose you'll pair strike a pose
air beautiful beautiful now we're at Dan
Dan soul food from Sichuan I like that I
like the cartoon going on here he's
gonna be good as going spicy
okay I like my spicy food I wonder spicy
one I went to it did it burn my asshole
did you burn my asshole I did it I need
a shitty Bravo I should rather like the
molten robber
it's how I know it's very good it is the
good one look at look at how happy
happen how very happy dude the couple is
eating eating the hot food and shooting
earlier asshole burning hot lava this is
chili oil go on to dumplings that was
pre mom yeah rebound it's so good so
much
and you know it's pretty bomb this this
looks the best is the best one
just look at it just lets me pluck at it
the elixir of life
take it away cow
yes
thank you sir I'm not Cheers
alright guys that is going to wrap it up
for the Hong Kong vlog of 2016 thank you
so much to ZOTAC for making this trip
possible both for myself 2.0 and white
pea sauce we all had an excellent time
checking out your guys's new products
that are coming very soon as well as
checking out the the factory tour that
was super cool as well so thank you guys
for watching this vlog be sure to like
it if you enjoyed it subscribe for more
stuff coming at you really soon and I'll
be seeing you guys in the next video
