brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below
we're at the in win booth but you
wouldn't know it it kind of looks like
we're in a toy factory or a Toys R Us or
something this is their Allis case very
interesting concept here this is
actually all made of plastic it kind of
just looks like a storage crate or
something but it's really just a sort of
an open-air test bench type of chassis
completely open-air however you can
actually get these these these fun
little covers for it these covers are
gonna come included but I guess you
don't have to really use them I kind of
like it without it honestly this would
be sort of like a lightweight testbed is
what I would use it for but of course
you could also use it sort of as a
statement piece in your living room it
definitely blends in with household
items a lot more than your usual PC case
if this is sort of a style that you're
going for it's kind of an interesting
layout here just really quick we've got
a triple fan 120 so you could do a 360
radiator here at the bottom you might
have to stretch those tubes a little bit
to reach the CPU on your inverted
motherboard layouts so with an inverted
motherboard you would actually have your
i/o your rear i/o coming out right there
and there's no front I oh actually so
you would have to plug things in from
the top of the case which would
technically be the back of your
motherboard kind of an interesting
design there you've got a couple SSD
mounts right there looks like one two
three at the front and on the back side
we have a power supply now this is where
the cable management area would go you
can see the back of the motherboard tray
there with a generous CPU cooler cutout
cable tie-down points that's going to be
very crucial in a case like this where
you don't actually have a physical side
panel because if any cables are sticking
out ever so slightly you're actually
gonna see them start to poke through or
try to you know it's gonna look like
alien coming out of your chest which is
probably not very attractive you can see
because of the inverted motherboard
layout that we also have the GPU which
is going to be mounted vertically not
vertically in the in the sense that we
usually refer to but you know kind of
more up and down orientation another
interesting quirk here is that we've got
a power button right but once this once
one of these sleeves is on it goes away
you can't really see it so you kind of
got a fish around for it I mean you know
once once you're familiarize with it
you'll know exactly where it is but I
can't even I can't even find it right
there so another little interesting
quirk there they're going to target this
at around $40 so very affordable
actually I was expecting a little bit
more
then again it is just kind of a plastic
frame obviously much cheaper material
than aluminum or steel and I guess one
of the many reasons this whole concept
came about is because anyone was trying
to look for an option that would be
fully customizable and offer a lot of
different color options that they were
actually getting many requests for so
people were saying hey make me a hot
pink case or an aqua teal case and
that's kind of difficult to do when
you're talking about metallic materials
but with this you can get a lot more
fancy with it so it's a lot more cheap
to design and eventually the goal is to
have a ridiculous number of customizable
options to pretty much do whatever your
needs are just a side note here I kind
of like the fact that you know you can
actually use this as an ambient light
you can see they actually put a light
bulb in here and it looks looks nice it
kind of like softly diffuses it with
this sheet that's wrapped around it so
it's you wouldn't even recognize it as a
PC if you walked into someone's home and
just kind of saw this sitting there you
can see they're also getting creative
with like their finishes we've got sort
of a fake wood material it looks pretty
nice I wonder like how sturdy this is
like what the weight capacity is like if
you could put objects on here maybe like
another miniature PC or speakers or
something it just kind of looks like you
can take advantage of this this is this
open space why'd you sauce also made a
good observation that this would be
perfect for like a children's bill like
a kid you know like if it was there like
first PC or fisher-price build or
something like that it's very you know
user friendly it's open there's no sharp
edges or anything to like cut them on
and it looks kind of fun right kid's
gonna be more naturally attracted to
something this colorful and whimsical
then maybe your standard chassis so so
this is the in win98 that they showed
off at CES earlier this year which
you're all pretty familiar with it
houses like ridiculously large oversized
boards like the asus rog dominus that
they have in there right now insanely
overbuilt case that runs for about a
thousand dollars people love the look
and the design of this chassis but
didn't want to spend a cool grand on it
so what anyone did was they heard their
cries and they made us a relatively
cheaper four to five hundred dollar case
in the form of the nine to five which
houses a more standard EAX motherboard
definitely doesn't skimp on the water
cooling options though you can do a 360
rad at the front as well as the top and
the way they've actually brought the
cost down here apart from just saving a
lot of money on materials because we're
literally shrinking down the side
is for one the diamond cut accent here
that goes all along the edges of the
case is nowhere to be found on the
nine-to-five and that saves surprisingly
a lot of coin you know when you're
talking about all the tooling and
manufacturing that goes into it
additionally certain accents like these
corners are made of plastic now a very
hard durable plastic as opposed to the
aluminum pieces that were here
previously on the nine to eight again
saving a ton of coin bringing it down to
pretty much half the cost of the
original
also if black is not your thing they
have it in silver as well which is my
pick I personally like this I love the
contrast I think it looks great a lot of
silver components on the market these
days so I think a wifey sauce is
pointing she's pointing to that one I
think I think she likes the black one
well she's been wrong before
it's okay you're not always right so
yeah that's the that's the 925 should be
coming later this year keep your eyes
out for it if you want something a
little bit more reasonably priced you
can go with the 905 they have the 905
with the OLED OLED display which they
have cute little or they didn't have
cute little Asian characters on there
earlier but now they have something much
more useful which I guess is good so you
get an OLED display that's kind of cool
you also have the option for RGB you
could do addressable RGB right here it
was doing more fun rainbow movements
earlier but you get the idea so the 905
is basically just sort of a it improves
upon the 904 you get triple rad or I'm
sorry triple 120s at the bottom you can
also do a 240 millimeter at the front
you can mount those radiators
simultaneously if you wanted to you can
see that you can clearly pull off a
really nice-looking custom water-cooled
build inside of one of these chassis
obviously that same beautiful brushed
aluminum all over the front we have USB
3.1 gen2 type-c which is always nice to
have here in 2019 dual USB 3 mic and
headphone jacks power button there's
kind of just very cool and modern
contemporary design the sort of empty
space negative space they're very
nice-looking chassis so I think the
prices they said was 275 for the
adjustable RGB and then you step up just
a little bit to $300 for the OLED so you
guys let me know which wouldn't you
would pick cuz you want the addressable
RGB or the oleate I think I think I
would go away not to not to make your
vote bias or anything but I kind of like
the fact that you
my zit and actually put some useful
information on there what's that okay
wifey agree on that widely saw so she
grew we agree on the oh let's see we
don't disagree on everything out over
here in this little dark corner of in
wins booth we have the concept it's so
new that it doesn't even have a name yet
they're just calling it the new ATX case
this is something that they're not even
sure if they're going to be bringing to
market or not they're getting a lot of
press feedback right now including my
own I give them a couple a couple of my
thoughts maybe you guys can share your
own down in the comments so this is an
ATX chassis as you can see we've got
tempered glass on the side there's also
a glass front panel right here which is
protruding it is sticking out a little
bit so you do get maybe ooh I don't know
five to seven maybe seven millimeters of
space all around one of the suggestions
I gave them was making this able to pop
out if you wanted to pop it out like
let's say half an inch or even a full
inch to really open up the airflow why
not look as clean but if you're
targeting users of all kinds including
ones who prioritize airflow that might
be a good option also I was a little
concerned that there's absolutely no
ventilation on the top here they said
the reason why is to keep it looking a
bit cleaner and more modern but I don't
really think that having a couple
perforated or punched in holes at the
top is really going to take away from
that
it is however going to potentially
reduce your your temperatures quite a
bit so I think that would be a good move
they have two mounting points for fans
120-millimeter fans that are going
straight to your GPUs which is kind of
handy I suppose if you didn't have a
second graphics card in here you can
down to 240 millimeter radiator and do
some liquid cooling that way ditional it
looks like we've got three one 20s at
the front so you could do a 360 red and
it looks like a power supply shroud
comes by default along with full size
compatibility for CPU coolers however
they have a low profile one in here
probably just to give press a better
look at the internals they're also
trying to target this on the relatively
entry-level side of things so anywhere
from 60 70 maybe even $80 of course the
lower the better for for consumers I
think 60 or $70 price point would be
fair we also have this kind of unique
layout for our front IO the fact that
it's slanted at a 45 degree angle is
actually kind of handy if you think
about it if you're sitting in your seats
this feels the most ergonomic to I just
kind of naturally plug in things that
way or turn your turn your system on as
opposed to attacking it from a right
angle so you guys let me know what you
think again this is just a concept right
now so anyone will be listening very
closely to use your feedback feel free
to let us know what you think down below
next up we have the in win at 3:09 this
is building upon the same in win 303
chassis that we all know and love I
really like the 303 I like the design I
like how all the intake comes from the
bottom of the case so they can you know
make the front all seamless and closed
off or whatever it's a relatively
competitively priced case as well to 303
but here we have the 309 which kind of
just explodes things to another level
you can see we have this fully
customizable LED panel and as you can
see they've got a couple examples here
exactly what you could do well they did
until in wind but it's kind of fun we
have the glow to software here where you
can control and program everything you
want you can even do individual per
square lighting customization you can do
whatever you want if you really wanted
to sink that much time into it it does
come included with three of these new
fans you can sync the fan lighting with
the front panel lighting it's all fully
customizable they're looking at a price
point of a hundred and ninety nine right
now you guys let me know what you think
of that you can also control fan
lighting and things like that from a
straight from the buttons on the front
i/o and I suppose the side i/o
your being technical the amount of
customizability here is pretty limitless
they were saying you can even add your
own logo for example maybe even a gif of
of you getting popped in the face with a
bottle who knows I think there's gonna
be a lot of mixed feedback on this
chassis at first until actual reviews
come out but you guys feel free to let
me know what you think alright that's
gonna conclude our coverage for the
Inman booth here at Computex 2019 thank
you so much for watching thanks to all
of our sponsors who have allowed us to
be here today feel free to check them
out in the description below most
importantly thank you you guys
appreciate all of the fans that I have
I'll show myself out right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
