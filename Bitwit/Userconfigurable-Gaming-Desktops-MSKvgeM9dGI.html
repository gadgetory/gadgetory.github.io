to you by fractal design MSI and cable
modern check out the links in the
description below or Mariah Carey will
sing at your next birthday party alright
guys we're back at the msi booth
checking out their desktop line these
are gaming desktops and it can be pretty
much configured in any way possible to
whatever your budget and needs are so as
far as specs ago these are all gonna be
rockin skylake chips core i7s I believe
I don't even think there's an option for
i-5 so I could be wrong on that though
but as far as graphics that's a again
it's all what you whatever you want to
be configured is is up to you so we're
gonna start off with the smallest and
we're gonna work our way up this is the
Trident 3 and you can see it's very slim
people were calling this or thinking
this was a ps4 from far away I can kind
of see why it stands up vertically it's
got a very slim profile and MSI is
touting this as the slimmest or smallest
VR ready PC that is currently available
I think that comes from the fact that
you can spec this out with either a GTX
1060 or later on the GTX 1070 in the
next coming months and also that there's
an HDMI port at the front panel which
makes it a lot easier to access your VR
hmd so definitely a GTX 1060 is more
than capable to handle VR these days and
you've also got some nice LED accents
that is going to be supported with the
mystic light software that I talked
about in the other MSI video that you
may or may not may or may not have seen
now on the right side here you can see
that there's ample ventilation going to
the video card and the GPU that they
have in here currently is a gtx 1066
gigabyte version and it's a shorter
version of their gaming series card so
it's actually only got one cooler fan on
there so that's how it's able to fit
into this very small form factor here
which is pretty impressive let's go
ahead and move down to the next one here
which is the knight blade mi3 and I
played mi3 this you can see is a little
bit more of a standard looking Tower
it does have RGB LEDs on the front so
that you can configure those any way you
want so again this is also rocking the
skylake processor we've got a GTX 1016
here six gigabyte version and we've also
got ddr4 slots of course two of them so
you can expand it up to 32 gigabytes if
you so choose we've got 2 m2 SSDs as
with a single 2.5 inch SSD mount if you
want to expand the storage on that
there's also two slots available for a
3.5 inch hard drive if you really need
to bring in extra storage on this system
as well we get an HDMI front panel port
so if you want to do some VR you can see
that MSI is definitely pushing the whole
VR thing with this desktop lineup which
is really nice to see let's go ahead and
take a look at some of the higher-end
offerings that that are actually pretty
sweet bringing out the big guns we have
the aegis x3 which is a pretty gnarly
it's got you see right here it's got
some headphone stands there are some
headphone holders I should say one on
each side actually so that's kind of
nice depending on which side of the desk
you might want to put this on whichever
one is more convenient for you RGB LEDs
right there by the graphics card you can
spec this out up to a GTX 1080 again
fully fledged desktop GPU no mobile
stuff here that's is actually a gaming
card in there probably a gaming X or
maybe a gaming Z but that's pretty nice
you've also got HDMI of course on the
front at the bottom as well for VR and
pro come a nice looking front here front
panel again with the crazy RGB is
everywhere everywhere you look there's
just lighting it's just freaking it's
lit its lit as let AFV oh you've also
got a little bit of a see-through window
there it's kind of hard to see from here
but it gives you a probably a better
look at your innards and this eye is
also touting their styling storm cooling
3 pro so basically what that is is the
reason why there's a 3 there is they're
dividing up their systems into three
separate chambers so one for the GPUs
which you can see are mounted vertically
which kind of also puts less resistance
on them when you're moving the system
around you've got one for the power
supply which is actually in the bottom
it's a proprietary power supply that's
believed 600 watts 6 or 650 I can't
member which one but does stay cool
there's plenty of ventilation underneath
and there's an exhaust ventilation out
the back so that there's 80 plus gold
certified as well and then you've also
got your third chamber which is on this
side I believe which is where your your
motherboard your CPU go your RAM and
things like that of course they're using
a riser card to get the the GPUs at the
top there on that separate chamber by
having all these different chambers by
having three separate ones they can
actually kind of target what needs to be
cooled in a more effective and efficient
way and last but certainly not least we
have MSI's flagship desktop in this line
which is the aegis ti3 this thing is an
absolute nightmare in a good way I
should say it's got of course mystic
light supported RGB LEDs at the front
you can pretty much trick it out as much
as you like there's also LEDs right
underneath the video card or should I
say video cards because if you take a
look at the panel up here actually I
don't to break it off it's that's a lie
it's running SLI there's two GTX 1080s
in here right now which is just absolute
ludicrous speed and whatnot you've also
got plenty of connectivity options
there's 2 m2 slots right there and via
me of course you've also got expandable
storage so while you do have 2 DIMM
slots on the opposite side of this case
which I'll show you in a sec you also
get two more som slots for expandable
storage up to 64 gigs this is definitely
for the power users who need that extra
horsepower and performance whether
you're gaming or doing some professional
work power supply is in the bottom once
again with plenty of ventilation going
in and out
I believe this they said 850 watts don't
quote me on that but I do remember them
saying that it was 80 + Platinum
certified which is also nice to see this
is also rocking that same Silent Storm
cooling 3 feature where everything is
kind of divided up into these sort of
compartments so you've got a chamber
here for your your 2 graphics cards
there is a fan at the front maybe I'll
get some b-roll of that there's a fan at
the front cooling those down plus
there's exhaust at the top looks like
there's really ample ventilation all
around this guy also there's a I don't
know if this counts as his chamber I
would say the power supply is more so
the second chamber and this grouping and
then the third one is off to the side
here on the opposite side which is where
your main stuff is in terms of your
motherboard CPU and your cooling so this
does come stock with an a i/o a 240
millimeter rad in fact and so you've got
plenty of cooling and overclocking
potential here on the z 270 platform
with that skylake chip and it looks it
looks pretty damn sexy once everything's
all put together and finally I can't let
you guys forget that this system also
has one of those front panel HDMI ports
for VR of course alright guys that is
gonna wrap it up for my coverage here at
the msi suite here at CES 2017 thank you
all so much for tuning in huge thanks to
my sponsors MSI naturally fractal design
