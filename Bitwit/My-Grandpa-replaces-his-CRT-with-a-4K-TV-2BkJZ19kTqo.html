the link in the description below for
more info what's going on guys welcome
back to the channel
I am currently whispering in my own
house because I am moments away from
surprising my grandpa with this 43 inch
4k TV from Samsung model mu 6300 this is
actually something that he bought I
didn't buy it for him he bought it on
Black Friday but he thinks it's like
three or four weeks away from getting
here he's old-school he probably thinks
it's being delivered on a carriage or
something but it's here and we're about
to take it downstairs and surprise him
my grandma's in on it my grandma knows
she's also down there I think she said
that this might give him a heart attack
or something hopefully that doesn't
happen but should be pretty fun he
really needs a TV upgrade we'll take a
look at that I should also mention that
I I did set up some studio lights down
there just because it was really dark
but I told him that we were filming a
completely unrelated video so he has no
idea what's going on or what's about to
happen so
dented it and tenten tenten surprise I
heard you like TVs dog so I put a TV on
your TV here it is
yeah you're welcome it's a very big much
bigger than your other one with
widthwise anyways we got it yesterday
but we had it delivered to the to our
office so that you wouldn't see it
we snuck one past you yeah you didn't
think it was coming for a while did you
yeah yes yeah I think that I think you
did I think you made the right choice I
think this is it's better to have a
bigger one because your couch is you
have a pretty big living room so you're
sitting further away from the TV I
measured it it should fit yeah I'm what
unless Samsung lied to us if Samsung
lied to us then we'll we'll sue them
your old TV how how long have you how
long have you had that four or five
years okay that's that's not as old as I
thought it was but it is it is pretty
gated just in terms of the technology
this is like some of the latest
technology you can get for a TV now so
it's gonna be a pretty nice upgrade
let's go ahead and do you mind if I if I
change the TV now yeah yeah it should be
fine
okay let's go ahead and set this up you
and grandma knew about it the whole time
she knew about it she was in on it
gram is purposely throwing shade right
now she doesn't want to be bothered
all right out with the old in with the
new
it's a grandpa I give you the honors go
ahead and turn that baby on for the very
first time pop its electrical cherry oh
it's work here it comes here it comes
whoo it's pretty good huh there it is
the news like you've never seen it
before but it'll look even better if we
actually give it some need to give it a
decent source so let's see can we fire
up YouTube or Netflix maybe honey
okay well the TV's all set up what do
you think about it yeah you like it yeah
yeah
how much better do you think it is then
your old TV was 80% that's pretty good
I'll take it
so you know you don't think you're gonna
be going back to your old TV anytime
soon
what are you gonna do with your old TV
give it away give it well I feel sorry
for that person okay what about the
image stands out to you the most very
clear yeah
did you do you think the color looks
nice too yeah beautiful
okay good good so obviously you're
already in love with the TV is there
anything that you would change about it
I know ftdi well the HDR models didn't
didn't run that cheap at the time I
couldn't find any good deal you know it
doesn't matter it doesn't matter the
point is is that it's a huge step up up
from your old TV and you could be super
grateful for it well grandpa I'm glad
that you're enjoying your TV do you
think it'd be cool if I came downstairs
once in a while and watched it with you
