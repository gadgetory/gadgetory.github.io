review this time it's the gtx 1660 from
Nvidia and Bargo just lifted do we
really have to do a dedicated video on
this car don't we already kind of know
where this is gonna fall I mean come on
I've got better things to do with my
time if only there was someone with
nothing better to do than to shoot this
stupid video for me I think that would
be really great if only I could find
someone hey honey alright so we're gonna
check out the new and videocard the 1660
1660 this is MSI's card
it's the gaming X okay this specific
model is selling for 249 but Nvidia is
MSRP is 219 so you can get it for a
little bit cheaper has the twin froze r7
thermal design whatever that means
design with the new Torx fan 3.0 which
gives you low temperatures in this
stable performance it also has a new
heatsink which is optimized for
efficient heat dissipation which again
keeps your temperatures low and it also
has a mystic light RGB awesome that's
all I really see on the back of the box
so let's open it
but it says gaming is my life and then
it says eat sleep game and repeat it
sounds horrible all right here it is
guys looking pretty good dude
so my first impressions of this card it
seems like a pre pretty sturdy card has
good weight to it the plastic is pretty
good quality too like sometimes when you
get a new product and it's made of
plastic it did seem pretty cheap but
this actually seems pretty nice I like
the brushed metal on the back that's
pretty nice
Oh Kyle always point this out it has one
eight pin thing right here alright now
that we knew what this card looks like
let's go over the specs alright um
looking at the gtx 1660 column here the
architecture and model is 14 turing to
1/16 the base clock is 15 30 megahertz
the boost clock is 1785 megahertz the
memory size is 6 gigabytes gddr5 the
memory bus width is 192 bits what does
this w stand for right here the TDP 120
w don't know what that means
before I forget it has a little note
here on the prices at the time of
filming these are the lowest prices that
kind of could find on Amazon and Newegg
alright so today's test testbed system
is featuring an AMD risin 7 2700 X 4.0
gigahertz OC and MSI X 470 gaming m7 e C
motherboard and a 16 gigabyte g.skill
flare XD
for 3204 the memory and a bunch of other
things said we're not gonna go over and
the video cars that we're testing today
are the msi gtx 1660 gaming X 6
gigabytes at MSI GTX 1660 Ti gaming X 6
gigabytes MSI GTX 1060 gaming x6
gigabytes man this is a mouthful and the
power color rx 580 Red Devil 8 gigabyte
and then the X s x RX 590 fat boy a
table bite alright let's see what the
results are
alright so the first game that Kyle
tested was ashes of singularity and if
we go straight to the GTX 1660 looks
like it's it's did pretty well compared
to the other cards that he tested not as
good as the GTX 1660 TI but not far
behind so so far based on what I'm
looking at right now it looks like the
GTX 1660 is doing pretty good but let's
look at the other games at Kyle tested
next one is battlefield one again the
GTX 1660 is doing pretty well still
looks like the 1660 beats out the RX 590
so again it looks like the GT s 1660 Ti
is outperforming all the other cards but
it's also the most expensive card at 279
so let's take a look at the third
testicle did which was with the GT 5
surprisingly looks like the AMD rx 590
is falling pretty far behind the GTX
1660 so there is a bit of a difference
there alright let's look at the Metro
last light test that Kyle ran Wow the
GTX 1560 ti hit a hundred and eleven
frames per second as the average the GTX
1560
only hit 97 but then the RX 590 hit 87
so there's a pretty big difference there
between those cards all right and it
looks like I'll only brand averages for
this last test for a shadow of the Tomb
Raider again the gtx 1660 looks like
it's pretty up there the TI is obviously
outperforming all these cards again the
ante cards just aren't really up to par
with the GTX 1660s so all right let's
look at the averages of all of these
cards Kyle put some like little notes
here it looks like the 1660 was 10%
slower than the GTX 1660 TI but it's
also cheaper so you know that's pretty
good it looks like the GC at 1660 was
faster though 8.4 % faster than the rx
590 so if I were to have to choose
between these two cards I probably would
choose the gtx 1660 just based on
performance and price alone and then if
you compare the the gtx 1660 to the gtx
1060 the 1660 was twelve point eight
percent faster now taking a look at the
RX 580 the gtx 1660 was sixteen point
three percent faster the RX 580 has a
price point of 199 and if we look at
that price point and how performed i
would say that this card rx 580 would
have to be significantly cheaper to
consider it just based on the price and
the performance of the gtx 1660 it was
it was just a lot better so you know in
conclusion to this I would say the GTX
1660 pretty good car
and there you have a folks that's the
end of this video
life pea sauce attempting to do an
overview and read off benchmarks how did
I do anyways we're gonna end it here
guys if you liked this video go ahead
and toss some like what does Kyle always
say in these videos subscribe to our
channel please if you have not done so
already and make sure you leave a note
in the comments that you never want me
to do an overview or review again I'm
just not as good as Caudill thanks for
