I swear kyle is the worst admin ever I
mean when's the last time any of us got
a proper cleaning when's the last time
he got a proper cleaning not to mention
he picks his nose like a widow
it's disgusting where are we give it a
rest short-term he's really got to stop
that oh don't be so harsh on him
he's been dirt poor since he started the
youtubes remember that time he spelled
ranch dressing all over the chassis that
wasn't ranch oh oh nothing beats the
time he clear the CMOS with the system
still running he really is a piece of
work now call me a cynic but Kyle
doesn't know the first thing about pcs

Pro everyone guess I'm new guy here just
curious

well put together the best admin have
