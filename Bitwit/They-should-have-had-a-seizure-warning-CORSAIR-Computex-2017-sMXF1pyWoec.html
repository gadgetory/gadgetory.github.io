to you by be quiet cable mod verda gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info
all right guys right course they're
checking out concept leaks
first of all look at the radiator
support looks like you got triple 140 s
at the top that's 420 millimeter
radiator and that is a little bit of
sixty millimeter thick rag that you can
still fit push-pull with no problems
whatsoever did I mention that you can do
two rows of four hundred and eighty
millimeter radiators at the front if you
wanted to this is just absolutely and
saying there's RGB elements at the front
it's small but tasteful and looks very
nice tempered glass of course would you
expect anything less at this point
ladies and gentlemen the trays that you
mount the radiator and fans to are
interchangeable you can actually pull
this out and swap it with the grill on
the top so if you wanted to you can have
the 480 exist on the top of the case and
the 420 at the front nine addressable
LEDs right here in the front fails and
you've got 20 more at the top io like
holy-moly and you also get a pair of USB
3.1 gen2 type-c ports pretty fantastic
you also get a dual system here so you
have a your full ATX power supply shroud
and then just above that you have an
actual mini ITX motherboard tray you can
see they've actually in the dual system
in here as the video card mounted
vertically and then there's just the
main system full ATX on the back of the
case it looks like we've got a dual
mounting setup for either 120 or 140
millimeter fans don't quote me on
whether or not you can mount a radio off
the back I wouldn't be surprised if you
could but I haven't gotten to confer on
that there's a power button here too so
on the other end of course there's sweet
here they've got another concept slate
that is an inactive there's no parts
internally just go ahead and open up the
case just so we can see what lies
beneath so this is the right side this
is where the cable management etc would
go you've got these two these French
doors basically that open up to reveal
some SSD mats you get four on each side
beautiful and you've also got just a ton
of three and a half inch drive mounts on
the bottom here that are mounted sort of
vertically in the bottom right corner
here is where you would mount your SFX
power supply for if you were taking
advantage of a dual system inside of the
concepts plate so kind of hides right
here behind the motherboard tray really
curious to hear your thoughts on this
case in the comments below so let me
know any feedback any sort of
modifications or changes that you would
like to see Corsair make should they
bring this case to the market we were
talking a little bit about pricing they
said it's going to be definitely more
than the 900 d should it come out but
they didn't quite say how much more so
obviously it's not going to come cheap
but then again you are getting a pretty
premium package this is the concept
curve guys and it's a concept you can
see that this is very much in the same
style and design as the 780 t but this
is a few differences here first of all
you've got these sort of prototype fans
that are I've never seen these before
and this is also unclear if these are
going to be coming to market pretty sure
they are they look sort of like thermal
thick ring fans but a lot nicer looking
in my opinion I am oh look at this
curved curved tempered glass all along
the front and the sides you no longer
had that acrylic side panel or whatever
plastic it was made out of it's got
actually a curved design to it and it
looks absolutely fantastic there's
orange trim I'm not sure if they're
going to keep the orange trim if it's
going to be offered in different colors
that wasn't confirmed but look there's
also a bunch of carbon-fiber accents now
this is real genuine carbon fiber and I
guess this whole system in order to you
know to get it the way it looks
authentic
carbon fiber this was like an $18,000
chassis I think if I heard that
correctly obviously the one that they're
coming out with or may come out with is
not going to have its going to have faux
carbon fiber that's going to lower the
price significantly it's going to be
over $200 but you can see that you still
get all of the same spacious interior as
you did with the original 780 see
everything else internally I believe is
identical and the white fleece off
spotted in the wild did it did you look
at these full aluminum feet here this is
a super sturdy but of course very
lightweight as well as some additional
information about these fans is that
I've overheard that they might be
replacing these black blades with some
transparent ones which would should
could
additional illumination for the overall
unit and there's going to be different
addressable LED sections or lighting
zones for the fan itself so apart from
the ring you'll also have LEDs
potentially in the blades don't quote me
on that but definitely in the frame of
the fan itself that you can actually
have different sort of customization
features that it's all going to be
controlled in a new software that is not
yet announced or confirmed this is all
conceptual guys so they might be
considering they may consider a
different software altogether that's not
Q that's not Corsair link where you can
actually configure and customize various
LEDs across multiple devices including
your fans your cases mice keyboard mouse
pad etc so as I mentioned just earlier
you know you've got Corsair link you've
got Q these different software
applications for controlling different
things particularly course their
hardware of course now the concept here
at this little kiosk is one single app
to rule them all so to speak and really
control every aspect of your system
whether it be the peripherals anything
from your keyboard your mouse to your
mousepad to anything internally your LED
strips the hydro cooler your fan speeds
etc just to be able to monitor and sort
of customize and trick out your overall
system and your setup so what's really
cool here is that some of the LED
features that implemented because of
course we all know course there is the
RGB master in the PC DIY community so
we're all pretty familiar with this
rainbow RGB effect but the reviser
effects for example has the ability to
sort of span across the entire keyboard
and then continue on to the mouse pad
and Mouse onto the system itself the
LEDs for LED strips and the other
components inside the case before
looping back to the actually the headset
as well there's just so many things
going on here before it goes back to the
keyboard so you really can sync up every
single element RGB wise with with this
new software that is again a concept
that may or may not be coming in the
near future with this software you would
also have the ability to sort of monitor
your system temperatures and your vitals
at a glance by basically illuminating
every elements in your system or your
setup in red for example if you are
overheating or things were just getting
a little bit too hot to be comfortable
and then that would instantly let you
know without ever having to open
the monitoring application that you need
to cool things down maybe crank up your
fans and that sort of thing so that's oh
that is really nice that not only is
this going to look beautiful
but it's going to be able to tell you a
little bit more about your system as
you're using it all right Joe that is
going to conclude my coverage here at
the Corsair suite at Computex 2017 huge
shout out once again to all my sponsors
for making this trip possible cable mod
verdict year be quiet and EVGA thank
y'all so much for watching stay tuned
for the next video it's coming really
soon have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
