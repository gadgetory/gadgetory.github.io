was place well it's an e6 so yeah I
guess that was like $15 six-pack don't
smash it really something like that are
you gonna open with a hammer clever that
is that does that work well it's a lever
I mean yeah but how well of a lever it's
mainly catching we have a perfectly
functioning bottle opener like literally
two inches away from your hand you are a
determined man sir when I was about to
drink beer he says it's hammer time
okay I'm gonna have this beer in this
most difficult way possible well you
know that we didn't have the tape
dispenser you could have come for that
right next week next people tackle that
challenge
welcome everybody to awesome Hardware
episode 118 side B this is a live show
that Paul and I do every single Tuesday
right here on twitch.tv slash awesome
Hardware at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time we
also stream the show to our respective
YouTube channels we like to split it up
into two halves on YouTube first half
this week is on Paul's channel you go
ahead and check out that link in the
description below of my youtube channel
or my youtube video and then of course
now we're on to my half so a sweet sweet
sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet stuff I
don't know what Paul's doing looks like
he's eating or sucking something out of
his sim beer out of his ear bud which he
isn't quite the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen
it'd only be more disgusting if it was
ever my ear very clean ear buds
we are selling stuff on our stores as
always thank you guys so much for the
last half of the episode for picking up
stuff but we're we are still selling
things we are not sold out of everything
yet so you can go ahead and pick up a
fidget spinner a very uh you know
one-of-a-kind bit wit branded fidget
spinner or the new limited edition Navy
maybe a bit wit logo shirts those are
also fun a lot of stuff on my store back
you can also check out paul's channel or
a paul store which is a paul's hardware
net our beautiful moderator cell
processing will also be
often links to our stores in chat for
easier access go ahead and buy something
from Paul store as well he's got all
kinds of apparel mugs glasses fights
glasses hoodies all that sort of thing
did she put something on my head put it
we can continue let's see I felt
something I was so distracted I can't
multitask I run on a single-core Paul if
you haven't been able to tell um this is
the chronic ale from Pizza port Brewing
Company it's an amber ale it's very
delicious Paul what are you drinking
there meanwhile I am drinking agha
spinner brow Munchen see I purposely
picked this beer because it's easier to
pronounce cheers to all of you ears who
are of legal drinking age shrinking
along with us this is also semi an adult
show not that we feel like you know we
don't send nudes or anything but we tend
to curse on occasion only when it's
impactful and meaningful and delivered
in a smart and intellectual way of
course um let's move on to our first
story it's really distracting cos wifey
sauce is unboxing it should tell us
stuff out in the hall so I can hear her
but everything's okay I'm sure he's
totally fine uh all right so everything
is like a squishing sound yeah like like
like she been run over by a steamroller
or something yeah that would concern me
like because it'd be like nothing out
there should be making that i
like-like-like if you're fisting a
pitcher full of jell-o well that you
understand I want to do it now just to
see and record it with this microphone
yep that sounds awesome
and then I'd upload it on like free
sound or should change the title of your
half of the show to fisting a picture
full of jello you know what's really sad
is that would get more views I just I
mean the ideas come to me from time to
time you are into the content genius
thing all right
first article of the day or my half
anyways is about coffee like these these
Geekbench benchmarks are getting leaked
left and right although this comes from
a reddit post so I guess grain of salt
of course we do have the actual log
scores on the Geekbench website but
again I don't know take all this stuff
with a grain of salt even if this is the
genuine marks from these CPUs we're
still early on you know
Intel's probably still refining things
here and there for their eighth
generation of Intel CPUs but here we
have the 8700 k with a single thread
score of 50 541 and a multi thread score
of 23,000 996 if you wanted to compare
that to
Rison 7 1700 X we're talking the single
threaded score of 4070 and a
multi-threaded score of 20 thousand nine
hundred and eighty seven so quite a bit
lower actually than than the flagship
coffee like i7 that will be coming out
again if these are all accurate and true
it's kind of interesting that even with
the six cores and twelve threads but the
is't the but the i7 Coffee Lake is
actually outperforming the 1700 X in the
multi-threaded benchmark because as you
guys know the 17 under X does have two
more cores and four more threads than
the flagship coffee late part here now
I'm assuming that's at stock right it
was not specified but for the further
when it's at least under the 1700 X yeah
okay I would think so so if you were to
overclock on all cores all eight cores
then perhaps we have a bit closer of a
match up here but promising things at
any rate from coffee lake the 8700 just
just in case you're curious scored fifty
five hundred and thirty nine points on
the single threaded score on the test
and multi-threaded test scored twenty
two thousand two hundred and forty nine
I guess you could possibly maybe compare
that to the rise in seven seventeen
hundred wait which one are you talking
about eighty seven eighty seven hundred
yeah which is basically like the Indy
700 K minus the hyper threading so
you're just not getting any any threads
just six cores but also scored higher
than the rice and seven 1700 by I don't
know looks like quite a big quite a big
margin definitely a wider margin than
what the 8700 K and 1700
saw against each other and then there's
the i-5 Recor I 5 8400 which I believe
is going to have do you know if the 8400
I forget is that a 4 or 6 core 6 course
6 core is apparently according to this
listing with a single credit score of 40
991 and a multi-threaded score of 19,000
799 again it's really exciting sometimes
to look at these scores and sort of
dream that daydream about what these
chips are going to be able to achieve
but as you guys know Paul and I are only
concerned with getting the real
engineering samples in our Studios our
offices our garages and test line level
for ourselves our what what I want to
ask again and and finding out for
ourselves once what once we have those
numbers for you guys but exciting stuff
nonetheless let's talk about our next
story which is about HTC thinking to
sell its entire vive VR branch which is
new that to me this is an article from
IB Times comm I saw a lot of other
publications reporting on this as well
this seems like it seems like HTC is
kind of on the rocks financially these
days especially after they kind of fell
from their initial smartphone fame they
were really the first vendor first
company to ever bring to market to the
mass audience a smartphone running like
Linux based Android software they were
huge I remember the HTC Thunderbolt was
like one of the first smartphones ever
it was super cool but now that seems to
that whole market has been taken over by
Apple and Samsung and HTC is kind of no
longer in the running there's kind of
fallen behind the times so they're
losing money like a mother effort they
actually dropped 75 percent of their
value over the last half decade or so
which is crazy so now they're
considering selling their entire vibe
branch the the entire VR business just
to stay afloat and that's kind of sad
because VR is really the only part of
the business
the article that's doing well everything
else is sort of at the at this
point and there's also been some talks
of HTC even selling its entire company
to a bigger company like Google or
something like that there's also you
know skepticism that that would happen
because I don't know that would be a
pretty big acquisition it makes more
sense for them to just sell one branch
of their business and so the whole thing
but it remains to be seen this is all
sort of up in the air at this point it
would be kind of interesting to just
it's kind of interesting to sort of
think about who HTC would sell their
vive via our branch to who would take
that over and what they would do with
with that that IP and that's that
product I don't personally have any
anyone in mind for who would get the job
done and best but I just hope it falls
into into some good hands because I've
personally been a vibe fan been a vibe
fanboy over the over the oculus rift
ever since I got both units and I
there's there's a special place in my
heart for for VR for sure I think it's
still very much in its infancy so that's
why it hasn't taken off into the
mainstream yet but I would hate to see
everything that HTC's work towards with
live and VR to kind of just get
slaughtered or fall to pieces because
there really isn't much competition in
the market apart from you know vibin
Aunt Em and rift what if they did like a
rebranding campaign if they rebranded
but they were still they were still
under HTC this shredded to scoop up a
different part of the market and they
should rebrand from HTC to THC I knew it
I just knew it a Suzy said yeah no yeah
saying yeah yep they wanna let me get
affordable for stoners and make it my
kind of controversial right you know
these day get the controversy up in
there they gets picked up by the by the
you say missus all the news would be all
over that
THC revived I would I would die I would
buy a THC vive come on a THC vibes
completely new vr experience immersive
okay it's like it's like a it's like a
pot-smoking simulator but you actually
feel like it's actually a real bomb
comes in the real vibe would be one of
those like you know the mass the gas
mask me a visor on it just get filled up
with smoke the smoke so real it's so
lifelike
oh wait that's real smoke yeah so
hopefully hopefully Paul acquires the
vive Ranch honestly I see it in know
better hands--and but we'll have to see
for sure really quick Vega
RX Vega 56 launched yesterday big whoop
how many people bought it at $399 how
many people raise your hands and chat if
you bought or if you were able to buy an
Rx Vega 56 yesterday at the time of
launch and please tell us in chat how
much you paid for it I'm very curious
apparently it was going around on Amazon
and Newegg for the suggested MSRP which
is 399 us we talked on Amazon lasted
five minutes five minutes Wow stock a
new egg lasted a few seconds wow wow
this is the main is a made really
vacuuming right now to make sure
I know you had a maid has thanks fired
that fired her it's good well good yeah
yeah you know what that sounds like
something fired people say we can carry
out she just find a clean break it's
just after the divorce things have been
that would be challenging all right
let's all be fine is it cast let's move
on in life in this episode pcie Jen for
coming this year oh really what a
transition and what we're uh coming now
yeah I don't know I don't know well you
know no I don't we'll see it says we'll
see it we'll see it around maybe not
from you know a mainstream graphics card
manufacturer like AMD or Nvidia buttons
you know implemented elsewhere this is
an article interlocked hardware it's
talking about pci-sig or PCI SI g which
is the organ is a organization that
defines all of these PCIe bus and form
factor specifications PCIe gen3
is interesting because it has sort of
broken the four-year release cycle that
pci-sig generally follows so PCIe gen3
has been out now for nearly seven years
so there's there's definitely a wide gap
there kind of like how Intel fell short
of the take their own tick-tock cadence
with with Broadwell and stuff like that
but here we have some representatives
from the organization blaming the delay
of PC a Gen 4 to industry stagnation
basically saying that it wasn't until
the last two years that PCIe gen3 had
begun to slow things down and and really
show its age and other deficiencies for
example artificial intelligence has been
more demanding than ever in the last
couple years storage devices have been
migrating to the PCIe bus in the forum
of the NV
protocol for example network networking
has suddenly developed this insatiable
appetite for more bandwidth so all these
factors have have really put the fire
under PCI PCI cigs ass to get their
rears and gear and and really bring PCIe
gen for to spec and so they have
confirmed that Gen 4 will be ratified by
the end of this year very very nice
some mighty vendors are already offering
16 gig at Ixil per second controller
transfer Giga transfer sorry controllers
and many vent vendors have also already
implemented PA agent for pH wise what
does PHY stand for I've met penny look
that I know PC agent for pH wise or ya
into their next-gen products using the
point 9 revision where as the final
ratified spec will be using 1.0 it will
be debuting at 1.0 revision the
organization also claims partnership for
healthy youth PHY PCIe gen for
partnership we're helping you physical
layer function or physical layer
function pho economics a link layer
device such as a mac like media access
control physical medium such as an
optical fiber or copper copper cable
okay
alright fair enough I understand now
yeah oh yeah it makes perfect sense I
can thoroughly explain this to my
grandparents the organization claims
that it's speeding up the development
and feedback processes along with
simplifying early spec revisions just so
that can reduce the time that it takes
to bring the spec to market because it's
already long overdue
they also say that 4.0 PC a Gen 4 will
be short-lived because they're already
fast tracking PCIe Gen 5 for a 2019
arrival which is weird because they have
the seven-year gap for PCIe gen3 PCI
gen3 every PCIe generation before that
has been for years PCIe gen3 was 7 years
and now they're gonna have a one-year
gap for PC a Gen 4 like why that's why
even seems hasty the
I don't understand what's why PC a Gen 4
is gonna be outdated in a year it just
seems silly it'll be interesting to see
what Nvidia name deters that's for sure
but that's all that's all for news
that's all for tech news we can move on
to other other things such as pin my PC
yeah this is a segment where you guys
send in pictures of your PC's and Paul
and I tell you how they suck and how you
can make them better except we're not
aesthetically quite as harsh
aesthetically of course first one is
from Eduardo Eduardo thank you for
submitting your PC for critique you've
got a rise in five 1500 X in your system
with a be 350 M gaming Pro motherboard
from MSI the gtx 980ti from EVGA a PNY
SSD to one terabyte hard drives energy
skill rip just five get just one just
one just one rip job you didn't even get
ripped jaws you get one rip job you got
a rip job and you know what okay okay I
was freaking out for a minute because it
just looked like there was no dimple
actual dimm slots on the motherboard but
it's there there is - there are there
are - yeah it's just kind of hard to see
but ok I like the black and red thing
here you kind of match that up right you
get a red you got a red stick of memory
to match the little heatsink accents on
your motherboard
there's a red SATA cable coming from
your your your hard drive that is one of
the boldest SATA cables I've ever seen
yeah it's like look at me you can see
exactly where my origin and destination
is yep it's like a homeless guy just
defecating all over the walls of a
bathroom no yeah Paul you weren't there
for that but I think what you should do
is that's what happened - nearby there
never no no the bathrooms here what in
the in the office that's where there's a
key yeah okay
you're smart um I think maybe if you
could flip around the hard drive so that
the red say the cable isn't just
glaringly routing around that way it
just seems a little it just seems a
little too
necessary for it to be traveling that
distance I feel like there is a little
bit of space behind your motherboard
tray where you can route any excess and
kind of like the black cable is that
there's another 3.5 inch tab below it
with a black cable which is you know
it's a lot more modest well yeah
it's tucked in there a little bit why
not just face them the other way also
what it looks like the 24 pin goes all
the way up here so it can come all the
way back then he maybe he was just
making use of XS yeah I think he was
trying to use up the on it or something
all right so this is a budget system
that is suffering from budget system
syndrome which is like a very spare and
sparse motherboard with not a lot of
excess you know not four dimm slots and
barely any SATA plugs and like really
just not a lot going on and it's a good
set of parts though for a budget build
yeah like it's it all seems fairly well
well balanced and I'd be curious to know
what speeds your stick of RAM is running
at with Rison but I think the hard drive
is that same ax cable is really killing
me the most plus you've got the sticker
still on the cable there's no reason for
that
you can pull the sticker off no reason
at least I mean since we're talking
about aesthetics here if there's a way
that you can kind of clean up the 24 pin
ATX route it through the closest grommet
instead of the furthest grommet away
from it or cable routing hole and sort
of just kind of tuck away that the
cables so that you don't see them
through the routing holes once you put
on that that backside panel I think I
could clean up the look a bit more to
help and apart from that pretty nice job
yeah I can
maybe there's no color clashing of any
kind really and also let's translate
this from Lithuanian oh could not
translate thanks Bing wait what did it
try to translate I didn't wanted to
translate this tweet from Lithuanian
to our language apparently apparently PC
specs is just bad Lithuanian exactly all
right next up is raised Ruiz he's got an
i-5 35 70k 16 gigs of RAM GTX 750 Ti for
the win now if you know me you probably
know the first thing I'm gonna say which
is computer off floor nah computer off
floor all right you've at least got the
bare minimum it's like you have not on
the console or something it's not
directly on the carpet there but you're
still you're sucking up so much more
dust into the system down here it's it's
a bad situation it's also got this like
power strip of shame like sitting on the
on top of it there like that's a crappy
power strip that that power strip any
fuses in that parish strip are long dead
it's not doing anything besides
providing more plugs it's just in an
hour
strip and not a surge protector I've
never seen anyone actually put the EVGA
sticker on on a system especially
externally here so I guess I have to
applaud your boldness there I also have
to think that it's probably not running
at max yeah the stickers false
advertising all right we have a an tech
neo Eco 400 watt power supply with some
pretty hideous cables going on here we
have what looks like a hype a hyper 212
variants possibly with I think a hugger
fan a cougar fan installed onto it which
is interesting color scheme wise five
and a quarter inch bay 3.5 inch drive a
rear exhaust fan bothers me because you
could have just rotated the fan to hide
the cable a lot better instead of
routing it around yeah okay do you any
mean just yeah rotate your fan so that
the cables already on the face like in
the back that way you don't have to do
this kind of weird sort of routing I
mean Greg you're looking at just there's
no good cables in this case all the
cables are awful that was my cable suck
the case cables I mean these these
cables coming from the case for three
point four like your front panel
connectors have this rainbow bright oh
yeah we know yeah yeah the rainbow and
the white right between
and like the beige cable for what
probably I'm guessing is usb3 maybe or
maybe it passed through yeah something
like that
and why would you have an external hard
drive internally placed on your power
supply when you have plenty of that yeah
when you have plenty of room in your
hard drive cage - a natively support
let's not cast judgment on people oh yes
external hard drive you're gonna bring
that up internally that was a that was a
situation of desperation assassinators
requires this spirit assess and that was
survival we were yeah the stakes were
high we had two days not the rest of our
life hey so I don't know what to say
about the system it's it's just it's a
little outdated and it's it's lacking a
lot of the base level features to make
things look pretty so yeah I think a new
power supply with black cables would
help a lot yeah if you gave it the case
of good cleaning but then you need a new
case and then not necessarily well I
mean if you want to get rid of the front
panel cables and the and whatever that
beige where I mean even going are they
going behind them unlike this beige
table here I'm guessing this is one of
those cases that was that launched in
that infernal time be pro wooden USB
three had come out but there is no USB 3
front panel so it's probably a
pass-through
mm-hmm going to the back I don't blame
you for plugging it in but it's just
there's not a lot to be done here
without a fairly significant system
overhaul yeah generally decent power
supply cable management is okay I mean
you've got decent airflow and everything
so there's nothing to be ashamed of
there it's just yeah you're looking at a
new system I think to make things look
too much prettier together yep well
thank you
Jacob EVGA yeah go ahead he built the
system for PAX West yes look at that Wow
he built it that's what he decided we
built it Jacobsen look at the energy
beams in it those are signs two modules
but
vga de TI with the shroud the
different-colored shroud you can get
it's got I believe this is a team group
memory kit team group I see
did he spray-paint that the ebj graphics
card no that's the that's I just said
that's the 1080i with the different
shrouds and different colors oh I forgot
they did that Yeah right everything but
purple yeah what the hell we call the
purple purple um
look at the case though it's got EVGA
yeah that's nice branded little nubs yes
like like like customized cufflinks but
there's been experience and is that this
is one of their cases I think it is I
mean it's got a VGA dubs on it then
maybe the EVGA doesn't make some cases
they do Oh a data that might be a
Datagram and we're hearing it's a did it
okay I was gonna say like it looks like
and if these data RGB herpes RM of
course nice Izzi 270 board from EVGA as
well they're using the power link and
it'd be cool if there are some more RGB
LEDs on this motherboard I feel like
it's kind of lacking I like its
abilities yeah I get that vibe all right
if we're being critical here this looks
like a very clean and high-end system I
feel like some cable extensions could be
nice here and EVGA let's be honest here
you guys make cable extensions I know
you make power supplies and cable
extensions they're not like the super
premium is of the premium like like or
anything like that but they're nice yeah
I think I think one of those sets could
have could have really topped things off
here and it would have showcased more of
your product lineup at PAX it would have
it like your your your your right so
we've got the EVGA power link here as
well which is in a weird situation
because the card is already rotated 90
degrees and then the power link is now
that makes sense because right yeah it
doesn't look bad it looks like because
the cables don't have to peek out this
but again here the cables being sleeved
or something like that I think would
look a bit yeah if they were asleep yeah
that's our main critique but Jacob thank
you for participating and sending in the
it's very pretty very clean indeed and I
should look at packs what tax west yep
is that right now all right
Safiye by Saffy Saffy your suffice
anyone angry to 7600 K at 4.9 gigahertz
16 gigs of cheapo RAM GTX 1080i super
clock - and an old power supply from be
quiet which I'm gonna replace you not me
but sappy okay cool let's see
Wow it's pictures I didn't really yeah
the pictures are a place that our supply
replace the power supply because oh my
god those cables place your camera oh my
god replace your camera maybe a new
camera place your camera taking your
picture taking skills let's see
man oh man what case is this it looks
kind of like a fan text but no it looks
it looks like the the window makes me
think oh it's a fan Texan - as soon as
you see it oh yeah it is okay I can tell
from the thingy final quarter yeah it
looks like an NZXT fan so okay couple
things here cables are hideous so
replace the power supply yeah I mean
apparently there he said old power
supply from be quiet which I'm gonna
replace soon yeah is very very obviously
and clearly the number one thing you
should swap it doesn't even have the
barest minimum of sleeping on it and
it's all brightly colored cables going
to your 8 pin your 24 pin and your 8 and
our supplies like that yes this is
pretty bad
beyond that you've got a big gap here by
your Drive cages
you should really tidy up the cables
there tuck them all tie them all back
behind the drive the motherboard tray if
you can yeah
granted you can't see that with the side
panels on but you know still you're
sending in pictures to pit my BC so
that's what we're gonna talk to talk
about yep maybe yeah upgrade some rant
your rams to have some nicer modules in
there ram definitely look look a lot
nicer just looks a bit bare bones IMO
can upgrade the look of your system bit
add some some bling there may be a rear
exhaust fan instead of just the top two
might fill out the case a little bit
more and also mask off some of the i/o
ugliness that's going on in the back
there because you don't have that Intel
gigabit ethernet stick you could remove
that but it's still just not the
prettiest I think a nicer looking fan
that maybe matches the top two of your
case would look pretty cool yeah kind of
complete it tight together but yeah
that's pretty much it thank you very
much happy horse a fight as Eckerd Zeke
Hren is it cream sacred details are in
picture a-ok don't really know what that
means and I like 6,300 Black Edition at
4.4 gigahertz a one terabyte Western
Digital black hard drive 250 gig samsung
s msi 970 gave me motherboard that is
leaking something from the vrm area not
sure what it is cooler master hyper 212
evo corsair power supply that's not good
yeah we got the full desk set up here
you should take that 976 super
stardestroyer for the top corner getting
even props for that as well as the video
you VW bus there I like that I like that
yeah it's pretty good okay moving on to
the internals a vertical orientation for
the CPU cooler that's fine your your PCB
on your your 3.5 inch hard drive stands
up significantly in this configuration
you know just don't know if there's a
and do about it I mean unless he got my
you know what you could do you know what
you could do Zechariah loose you
couldn't you couldn't buy like a like a
5 and 1/4 inch to 3.5 inch adapter since
you do have a looks like three and a
quarter five and a quarter inch bay that
way you can mount the computer off the
Lord sorry computers on the floor I'm
just not realizing computer off floor
there's an apple sticker on the front I
mean okay maybe it's a hackintosh uh
ironic
all right yeah your kill management's
pretty awful here your case is is this a
fractal case with the vertical maybe
like a core 1000 I believe this is a
fractal case yeah it looks yeah can tell
from the white PCI expansion slots yeah
which also means is there's not a whole
lot of cable management options in here
either but I do feel like this connect
this kind of massive stuff down towards
the bottom that can be cleaned up yeah
that just shove it to the front of your
case we shove it behind that you use the
the harddrive mounting wall as sort of a
blockage to hide some of that even take
your hard drive here from the top and it
mounted down to the bottom yeah and that
way it could even hide some of the
cables down there and stuff then he
covers up the video card yeah yeah
you're right let's just go full SSD go
all just ditch your hard drive entirely
ditch larger get another Samsung 850 Evo
they're pretty cheap these days and call
it a day if you really wanted to go
first etics okay um nice little budget
build though yeah not very budget I mean
he's gonna be 970 in there
she takes 970 is pretty good yeah
alright Brian last but not least the
core i5 4690k overclocked to 4.8
gigahertz at 1.3 two bolts eight gigs of
ram and even a gtx 970 and a 450 d from
corsair forgive my condiment cables haha
uh you were not forgiven first off so
you'll be sentenced to death but in the
meantime looks pretty good cable
management's on point again you'd have
to replace those cables or get some
extensions to clean the look up a bit so
we're not looking at ketchup and mustard
all day let's say you've got some Noctua
fans up there at the top I'd like to see
some the area oh yeah on the a/o I'd
like to see all Noctua fans of that
color and style across your case at the
rear at the front of the cool I think
that would look cool I'm sort of
different those those fans are great and
they're fairly affordable for NOK Tua's
they perform well and
they don't get used as much as their
other line of fans but yeah trying to
figure out what this whole expansion
card is right here that's is my future's
in it
Ethernet maybe you're like a 10 Gigabit
Ethernet possibly it looks pretty tiny
and just say um you can remove the power
supply sticker if you want to just sort
of block that out not a huge deal but I
don't know I don't like I don't like
seeing like charts or like oh I seem
like lots of information how will you
know whether it's got a single or double
joke I'll care Paul it's got the
wattages it's got enough wattages okay
um it looks like you're there's a cable
that's coming from your water the one
the aerial water block that's going
across your vrm heatsink that looks kind
of like it could be tucked better I
don't know if that's uh
if that is straight from the water block
or if I don't know what that is but it
just it's distracting to me
um there's uh just barely like I think
that might be like your USB 3 cable or
something like that that's being shown
right above the the hard drive cage you
can see there's a little bit of cabling
against the bat the the backside of your
motherboard tray maybe you could tuck
that away so that looks a bit cleaner as
well I tend to do that with with builds
that that I build also I didn't see this
brand because I haven't been following
Twitter quite as as thoroughly but
apparently he also tweeted to me
July 8th wow that was a long time ago it
says send nudes to Paul that's on his
to-do list said no send notes to Paul I
think he saw it at IKEA anyway I want to
point that out
good enough sorry I didn't catch that
but uh yeah
good advice yep excellent advice yep the
best advice thank you all for submitting
your entries to pin my PC we will be
doing this segment again in another week
so if you didn't get picked this week
don't worry about it don't cry you might
have a chance later let's move on to our
last segment of today's episode which is
merle time where you guys send us mail
and we have a packages and hope they're
not bombs let's start with our first one
which paul actually noted pointed out
that it seems to be covered in blood
so we have what seems to be here a blood
sacrifice from our first sender is a
smear of blood who is good i can't read
it it's all heard it says come from
micro Sarris meet up someone from
kentucky written from kentucky a higher
state of contention I hope this is not
real blood otherwise I'm very scared to
see what's in the rest of this package
let's have a look though shall we haha
okay so this you take okay this is a
serial ata this is SATA cable a red say
the kale is a coincidence Paul that we
have received a red SATA cable after
specifically critiquing a red SATA cable
unpin my piece and that is five minutes
that's insane that is iluminati times a
million okay so notice this was an
Amazon order someone ordered this from
Amazon and had it sent to you because
the address on here is an Amazon
Fulfillment Center okay
citrus micro citrus micro citrus micro
thank you for the read SATA cable okay
it's a 40 inch 40 inch SATA cable it's a
very long save
Kable was there a note did they include
a note there is why is Amazon Oh No why
is there blood yeah I don't know it's
like the the guy who is no measure
services is really riding their
employees this is really strange I mean
like there's no note these are just
Amazon receipt things and it's just a
read SATA cable around 40 inch you know
what's weird it's like a read SATA cable
and there's like blood on the envelope
there's no note it seems like kind of a
death threat
just saying yeah just regular SATA cable
just a plain old SATA cable with caps
when you buy a SATA cable it comes with
caps on the end of it always comes to
the caps but I mean this one does
interesting I feel like someone's
watching me right now besides all of you
what's next next we've got Bigler mr.
Begler didn't think we've send you
something I believe so Bigler sounds we
did we did mail time on my half of the
show last week yeah so that's why I
don't really have much for today cuz my
box is empty but then hey I got I got a
to see don't show me no no for all of
your tuxedo needs and flamingos no not
foaming go needs Paul just but we found
this out last week that he was in the
taxi know the business of tuxedos and
not of flamingos two very different
things
somehow come together beautifully on
this shirt okay Thank You Bigler and
some some pictures of bells that you've
previously worked on they all look
fantastic probably a better job than I
can do just show the people oh there's a
letter in here to Barry oh is it the
same one possibly Jason he's 26 years
old he lives in Montana and he's
starting to build his first gaming
computer ever about two years ago he's
watched a ton of his
ten of my videos and got inspired
there's a lot of stuff here
black and white so the black and white
build is his tuxedo build get it because
it's a tuxedo
ah it's clever and the NZXT Manta hey I
like the black and white one here with
the with the pink accents yeah that cool
it's fun awesome thank you very much for
the for the letter Jason I'll be sure to
read the rest of it later on but cool
I'm always looking for new t-shirts
honestly I will probably wear that one
that's not going anywhere
right that's not a completed bill that's
all I'm saying well it doesn't even have
fluid in it so I mean yeah it's looking
pretty good though
like I'd love to see that all finished
yeah looking real nice real nice
yeah all right and then this is from our
good friend Brian
oxic he's the guy who has also sent Paul
and I our own cornhole boards and our
own graphic t-shirts with like our own
faces animated on the shirts it's like
he's amazing he does all kinds of cool
stuff I'm looking forward to seeing what
the hell he sent us this time Paul is
gonna use a hammer ineffectively to open
up the box when I have a box cutter
about two feet away sorry Paul
stop it you're reckless you're reckless
the doctor told you not to do that
anymore I'm gonna do it and open the
package I'm good at unboxing no you're
not
all right go ah be careful just kidding
alright Andres got in here who is this
no not the Kings Bank of the West Bank
of the West drive-up currency coin
envelope okay filled with drugs just
send you money no drug money was just
like a bunch of should I be putting my
fingerprints on this round it is this is
this what is that they're all ones okay
they're all like there's at least what
there's gotta be at least like fifty
ones in here like this is up this is a
fattest stack of cash I've ever seen and
then on top of that yeah we have a
letter good you crazy mofo I hope it's
not like a picture of you naked or
something just a hundred dollars it's a
hundred cash it's a hundred why why see
paying us we're supposed to pay him blah
opinion yeah that's pretty good
oh my god like that this is like that so
this is a series of different thermal
interface material application methods
we've got the line method it says good
the the pee method which is better and
the turd method which is bit wit
approved best because this is often the
method that I tend to go with this is
you you cease to amaze me this is this
package is a bit of a studio warming
gift for Kyle's
oh hang up on the wall nice long said
the awesomesauce Network cornhole board
and when you guys build cell processing
his new system is to thank you for all
he's done for you guys and enjoy the
show Kyle introduced an amazing new
thermal paste application method does
inspired me to take this to make this
mess Cal hope you like it enjoy and it's
the snakes really I do of an educational
content he had some other information
here about because we talked about the
the t-shirt stuff because he's made some
t-shirt designs we've talked about
integrating this before and we've had
positive responses I didn't send an
email about that oh did you just write
before John went on his vacation ah and
then John came back from vacation I'll
jump and I haven't responded to an email
from John in the past two months oh my
god no I suck but you know if it makes
it all the more worth it when a process
takes a long time to get from you know
the point A to the point B that's what
you're gonna say here that's my excuse
so um
Brian thank you again you've been
awesome with all the stuff you sent over
but seriously how do you explain this
like why I mean this is amazing
I'll have that for right because we Joe
or cuz we joked at some point in the
show that so we're just gonna open
something and it's gonna be essential
money and that's it impressive we should
have pretended it was hundreds we should
I really should have not you are
instantly like they're all ones I
thought about saying it's only the
outside mills
only the outside mills are like we take
the thing and we're like this is what it
is that's what I usually I didn't think
to immediately deceive yes everyone
always think you can just see that's the
first thing I do oh my view about that
more but I mean this feels good man this
feels good this is at least like some
weight
this is weight that's my natural I am
you know what Zack I'm just gonna I'm
not gonna do anything with this I'm just
gonna bring it carry it around with me
and then I mean anywhere I go I'm like
oh you guys take cash okay you take card
- all right I'll just do card I'll just
you car yeah and I'll just like put it
away mean like this
just happens to Syria rounding a hundred
it'll that you don't have changed
everything yep
or though I'll just be like that guys go
district hit good Lord it's also
possibility it makes me wonder like did
he just have all of these did he collect
these over time did he go to the bank
and request to pull out a hundred
dollars in ones Brian you're a crazy
mofo and I love you
thank you so they're all lined up
they're all lined up too so I used to
work a job it's important all right full
disclosure I used to twist balloon
animals I know that's what's cool in
animals nerd no that's very weird like
nerds with balloon animals no but I
would get fed I get cash tips so
whenever I would come from an event or
whatever or from work I have all its
cash and you know you guys count up all
the cash and you always lined them up so
that they're all facing the same
direction you know the president is
looking at you with the face with the
head facing up and I just wanted to
point out Brian did that with all these
ones before they came to cast their
thank you very much Brian
I appreciate it dude sorry it took me so
long to finally open this but chat I
will make a balloon I have talked about
you're like are they talking about your
balloon history your history not let's
have a thing you forget you don't forget
how to do it hey would you don't it
seems like exactly the type of thing
that I'd forget so the main you take a
week the main thing I would need is
balloons
cuz I'm pretty sure all the balloons I
have are like eight to ten years old and
would not be still viable for twisting
because they just pop hmm so I need to
get new balloons maybe fresh ones some
freshies maybe at some point I'll get
new balloons and I will twist some
balloon animals on the live show yeah
that'd be awesome actually you could
take requests for donations it's been
long enough after like I stopped doing
it for a while and
one who knew I did it was like you know
it's just food animals I just like
you I will not be the balloon I'm I'm
not your balloon monkey but no I yeah I
mean I can I can do it I can make a
little person and a little water cycle
and put the person on the motorcycles
that's I didn't even know that was
possible
yes it's pretty cool actually yeah you
should be you should do like you know if
you send me balloons do a PC if you like
a video please send me balloons I need
to 60s two inches two inches diameter
and sixty inches length Wow
and you know like the balloon dimensions
and everything that's the only kind I
use it's not like yeah we got a
professional balloonist over here is
there an official term for someone who
does that Swiss blue yeah I don't know
I'm not really shouldn't balloonist but
actually we're in Santa Ana and this is
where I used to come to pick up my
balloons there's a story near here that
really that does it's like an industrial
party supply store you need to have an
account to go in there and buy stuff and
that's where I used to go and buy the
balloons yeah well and perhaps in two
weeks
Oh get some balloons in here
show you show you his skills his
balloons so I said most people know how
to make little people I was never a
clown I never dressed up as a clown

business anyone who's watched the last
pre-roll I uploaded today
no don't watch that pre-roll actually
honey you're gonna have to give me a lot
more than $5 if you want to see any of
this all right
this is this is like the Paul special
all right
Paul gets away with $5 but after our
little after our little scuffle earlier
today
you're gonna have to do a little bit
more than that I'm sorry you could take
a lesson you can take a lesson from your
father who donated 50 times more than a
lot many times the charitable see shirt
donor than you either way that's that's
true fortunately yeah money taught me
demanded no such demands no such demands
indeed thanks honey
maduk Oh didn't Ogden for the five New
Zealand maybe NZ so thanks to you guys
that I built my first PC I have a core
i5 7600 K overclocked 25.2 concurrence
in the GTX 280 I Strix coming a good CPU
GPU combo or should I get a 7700 K I
think you're fine with the 7600 K that
card unless you really need the
multi-threading now especially with that
overclock you're good but that overclock
you're totally fine unless you're like
video editing if your video editing I'd
want a paper but that's the only
exception everything else you're totally
fine same good man same guy for another
father five sorry mister site Paul since
it's hard for me to watch since work
time here in small New Zealand so Kyle
share the love with Paul well I think
you very much this Frank you so much for
nice of you sir
lost collector $10 rise in 1700 OC 23.9
Asus GTX 1080i build gaming / work rig
what would you PC pimps recommend dual
Asus 27-inch 1440p one millisecond 144
Hertz or
Asus 34 inch ultra wide 1440p 100 Hertz
or weight for Asus PG 3 5 BQ 200 Hertz
damn I would say get it now get that
gaming / work alright wait okay okay
hold on hold on hold on all that you
have to look at the whole picture here I
do I see it I'm assuming he says single
1080 TI he's also got risin 770 1700
which has been appropriately overclocked
to 3.9 gig
however not gonna get absolutely every
frame out of that ten atti that you can
I would say go for dual 27-inch 1440p
high refresh rate when you game game on
one of them at 1440p hundred and forty
forty one hundred and forty four Hertz
which it's an ATI should match up nicely
with if you go for the ultra wide I mean
I liked ultra wide experience but I'm
not sure if you're talking about a
g-sync
option or not that would be the other
big contributing factor here would be
100 Hertz it's probably got a sink
probably but there's a three four
hundred dollar difference between
34-inch 1440 ultra wide with and without
G sink well you say anything else right
so it might not be an issue yeah what to
say what concerns me is that your
27-inch 1440p that's 144 Hertz at one
millisecond what concerns me is that it
might be a TN panel and not an IPS at
that very low response time yeah so if
you were depending on the work that
you're trying to do the kind of work if
you're doing anything web designer based
graphic design color correction editing
of any sort I would recommend highly
that you get an IPS over a TN just for
better color reproduction so get one
twenty seven inch or fourteen forty one
millisecond naming hundred and forty
four Hertz high refresh rate TN panel
the aint game on and then get another
27-inch 1440p panel or you don't care
about the refresh rate and it's IPS and
as really good color depth and that way
you could do your color reproduction
stuff on one side under gaming on the
other side and still both panels for
multitasking that'd be a nice situation
lots of options I think you you'd have a
you know this pros and cons for h1 each
one but yeah I it very much depends on
what your your main main use cases yeah
good luck hopefully that's helped though
the price five dollars Eduardo here that
red say that it was from an old PC and I
wanted
check if the hard drive works Ram is
2400 eight gigs plan on OC and adding
more later thanks
so that was food that was from okay
apparently he thinks is lardo the hard
drive works so you want me to use that
cable
wait what it looks like a brand-new
cable who did purchased from Amazon it
was from and chips he said it was from
an old PC I don't I don't see how that's
possible
didn't look like there was a single
speck of dust on it it still even had
like a perfect I don't know what I think
you're an impostor lacrosse regardless I
appreciate your five dollar donation
we'll have to investigate further
automatic met five bucks for weeks
without drinking and now it kicked my
ass only got two shows left I think
before my ship date please Paul htpc big
please Paul hie PC
TPC I just posted my CPC follow-up video
so you need to post your follow-up they
cheap easy video they'll built the case
yourself did you hey hey
tomato tomahto as they say all right my
my piece of wood apparently has some
some bugs in termite and when I don't
think that termites but in one very
small corner of it there's some there's
a couple very small holes and and
they've the holes have been ejecting
little bits of sawdust and it's making
me think it sounds like termites well
there's different there's different
types of beetles and mites and other
things like that that can get into wood
and heat it and I don't think it's if
eclis termites though but yeah I I'm
gonna figure that out it's the problem
with making your entire case out of wood
is that it can get eaten by ants
or eaten by bugs yes that'll be
interesting for one of those things that
you know the the the the kilning process
is supposed to kill but yeah oh so I'll
I'll figure that Dylan wreak five
dollars we were here from Alaska want to
send some local brew core i5 7600 K 5.1
6 gigahertz 33 33 Trident Z 16 gigs
gigabyte 1080 turbo 2000 83 megahertz
MSI tomahawk boots in 18 seconds nice
sounds like a pretty sexy system tonight
Wrigley sends us some Alaskan beers yeah
as long as it's not Alaskan amber cuz
I've had that one I'm not actually sure
if that's even from Alaska I assumed it
was because this was a named Alaska but
it could just use the name but is this
imposter beer at any rate I know very
little about Alaskan craft brew so uh
send away
most of what I know about Alaska I
learned from Cain mm-hmm people from the
last car crazy yeah pretty much
crazy Cain is a crazy mofo Dilbeck
twelve bucks five seconds Paul thought
the hammer was going to work was
priceless as Paul did you enjoy twisting
animal balloons for money uh Scott I
will say it was a very good job to have
right at a college because I was able to
work actually during college and towards
the end of college because I was able to
just work on weekends go to restaurants
make cash tips yeah you know it's weird
I've worked with lots of different
restaurants but I have never actually
been a server I've done different jobs
and different restaurants but I've never
been directly a server but yeah I mean I
would go to like an El Torito we had
regular accounts at different
restaurants I gotta like in El Torito or
a TGI Fridays and I worked for like
three hours
twist balloon animals for the people who
were there and you know for the little
kids and get some tips and stuff like
that so yeah it was it was a good job
for for that time in my life El Torito
yes it's pretty fun alright next up
we've got one from deep man Jim in for
the five bucks dirt man
dirt man sorry kind of ironic that I'm
sending you money even though you're
kind of holding a stack of cash oh
whatever big fan bit wet thanks man
that's super true if I could just reach
out to you and hand you a dollar I
totally would
yeah but thank you very much Joseph
t-shirt for the five bucks balloon
mechanical keyboard no other comment
balloon mechanicals that's a challenge
like there's a light light that is it
that is a challenge oh he's saying make
a mechanical keyboard enthusiast real
genuine chair MX switches to yeah oh
yeah yeah that's totally possibly
david burress for the 50 MX don't know
what that is which microphone are you
guys using do you have it above or in
front of you it's a it's a Sennheiser
it's right there it's a MK h MK h and
something how much money did it cost
it's $1000 microphone - $1000 sennheiser
shotgun microphone yes it's incredibly
high-powered it's um let's see it's the
MK aged 416
it's the 416 this is also the same
microphone that a lot of other big yet
youtubers use I know ed from Texas is
mkh user I believe and Kay PhD as well
it's a very good microphone since a
thousand-dollar microphone plugged into
a like $80 sound yeah
which could potentially explain why
might be some of them on the show
Adam W ten dollars I'm looking to buy a
relatively silent RGB gaming keyboard
should I go membrane or mechanical is
wired better than Wireless any specific
model or switch recommendations so if
you want silent I mean there is
specifically a cherry MX silent switch
that you might be interested I mean like
Trane mix Browns just as quieting Browns
and reds are both very quiet but they
don't have the click enos I personally
prefer Browns because they like a little
bit of tactical feedback as I'm walking
out the key I like the little bump there
into um
is wired better than Wireless I mean I'd
go wired yeah I usually go wired
Wireless is acceptable
it's finicky it's still familiar
mechanicals yes I mean you're never
gonna be more secure in your connection
between your keyboard and your computer
than with Wired yeah so MX
speed or MX brown or MX red depending on
your preferences I suggest you buy a
little tester if you're really serious
about it you can buy a little tester to
test all the you know various switches
to find out exactly which one you like
best and as far as the motherboard or
I'm sorry the vendor themselves I mean
you're pretty much good to go as long as
it's Cherry MX
it just depends on what kind of little
features each one offers like we were
saying earlier razer corsair ducky from
mil oh all those all those brands make
some good products so just it's a
personal preference at that point but I
would go wired I would say Wireless
mechanical switches mechanical keyboards
right now are there's a dearth of
options so um for more stability and
reliability
I would I would go wired but thank you
Adam for your donation thanks Adam
automatic Matt again and once again for
five bucks check Twitter for Paul's
Clown Hawaiian job pic oh I can't wait
to follow up with that that sounds good
whatever it is sang I don't even care
what did it is that it that looks like
closer to me that looks more like me
because it's an Asian dude with glasses
although I was never a Hawaiian clown so
Paul's Hawaiian clown job that sounds
dirty
who is that clown job looks familiar he
does look familiar I should know who
that is that's close to I mean Hawaiian
shirt and the clown the clown did you
have a clown no big like that no I was
it was I
like Hawaiian shirt and shorts itself
and the wigs nothing clown related
there's no wig no way never a wig damn
it will they get for sharing my boob
you know I open up to you guys share
this personal information this is what I
get you should give a lot of people
dirty clown jobs Pete what that's not
one check who's just hey what that what
happens at the end of a clown my sanity
right now is not a thing well maybe you
commit likeness
I mean if I knew what it was I would
tell people I like I like to share I'm
broken all right let's move on
Rodimus Rodimus for the five bucks
because you and Paul inspired a visually
impaired Guide to build his first PC hey
cool BS can a brother get a follow on
Twitter lol Rodimus ruddy mutt everyone
go follow Rodimus follow the out of
Rodimus right now ro ddim USS
I'm glad we have inspired you in some
way Rodimus it's indeed that makes me
happy
Scot Dilbeck six dollars and sixty six
cents good what's the price of Pitt my
PC reservations you there is there are
no Pitt my PC reservations
it just has to come naturally if I feel
like a system is worthy of being
critiqued and and and it sucks no no
this is so that it sucks but has room
for improvement generally there are a
lot of beautiful pcs that I'd love to
show you guys every week but there
wouldn't be much for Paula Knight to
talk about on the critique side so can
be a struggle that's why every once in
awhile I'll do like an honorable mention
or a special episode of to my PC where
it's pimped pcs or something like that
but yep that's how it goes
sleep u21 good to know yeah sleazy 21
for the 10 bucks sup guys I bought the
DG 87 which is a UGA case I believe and
I'm planning on water cooling for the
first time I've watched many of your
videos about water cooling in your
opinion what's the most difficult or
easiest thing about water cooling um-hmm
the easiest thing is filling the loop
because it's just you're just pouring
liquid into something and you gotta
switch on the power and switch off the
power before it goes down it's pretty
simple there's a lot of easy things most
difficult thing is just practically
dealing with the facts that you have a
bunch of water that you're putting
really close to a bunch of computer
parts the best way around that is to
work with a external or a different
power supply than the actual computer
that you're working on in order to power
your pump so you can cycle through the
water and make sure that the loop is
leak free and all that kind of stuff
doing that will will will give you a
much more it'll give you a much better
experience you won't be nearly as
worried about about
that kind of thing because even if you
get water on your fancy computer parts
your graphics card your motherboard or
whatever if the parts if it's not on if
there's not electricity flowing through
those parts lemon drawing it happens
yeah you can almost always get dry it
off as much as you can let it dry out
completely and everything is usually
pretty much fine after that
yeah but yeah and it's just the fact
that water electronics like they're not
the best mates they're not supposed to
go together so you have to be careful
with with that so figuring out your runs
can be tricky too yeah especially if you
want to get creative with it and not
just get the job done where you just
need to go from A to B but if you want
to look aesthetically pleasing figuring
out your runs and how to sort of how
that's all gonna look in the end can be
really tricky especially because
sometimes you have a limited number of
fittings to work with some of them are
only straight angles some of them are
right angles some of them are 45 degree
etc and you sometimes have a limited
number of options to determine what what
the route is going to look like and you
of course have a vision in your mind
sometimes sometimes it doesn't work out
there's a lot of improv improvisation
that goes on I feel like with the custom
water cooling but it's all part of the
experience and can be very rewarding if
you fall through with it so good luck
good luck thanks sleepy
alright it was let's roll through these
last few pretty quickly because we were
short on time not a real potato five
dollars can one of you say Paran garlic

child Tyler bradden
$5 hold on what's up okay carry on okay
Tyler Bradley $5 tell me where is
Gandalf for I much desire to speak with
him also hi he fell I'm sorry
hypothetical pizza $5 donation do you
need a video editor I need a job I can't
figure out how to attach my resume to
this hypothetical pizza that is a very
good question
as far as needing an editor I know that
Kyle has an editor who he I believe is
going to be hiring on I don't want to
speak too much for Kyle here but I
believe he's bringing him on as a either
full-time or part-time or paying him
more money or something like that I have
an editor his name is Joe who I work
with and we've been working with for
quite some time and he does a pretty
good job for me so I can't say I'm
looking for a video editor right now but
yeah make a real make a real so that you
can post say here's a youtube link with
my reel here's stuff I've edited that
I'm proud of and that's a good way to
attach your resume to stuff like that
yattawan you had a lot of dollars what
water block system would you recommend
for EVGA for the win 3 GTX 1080i my card
running so hot that I can cook a steak
well-done I only need system for GPU
water block system a water block EK
water blocks makes fantastic quality
products that i'm sure that you would
enjoy I have the most experience with ek
over other brands I've worked with their
blocks and their products the most and
I've been satisfied pretty much one
percent of the time I can't speak and I
know that there are other great brands
out there for that card you're gonna
need a block that's designed
specifically for that card because the
EVGA for the 1-3 1080i custom piece of
the custom PCB so that's gonna be your
main concern what are your options
water blocks that actually fit that card
and I believe he can makes one I'd also
checked like alpha cool there there
another good one beyond that like Kyle
my water cooling experience is a little
bit more limited yeah so yeah but yeah
ek has a several good kits that you can
buy that are contained and do a pretty
good job yeah
not a real potato five dollars from me
to the clown
buy some balloons belongs he said ball
belongs which is French following buy
some bottles escargot Richter five
dollars five dollars on the Richter
scale hey I have a risin five sixteen
hundred looking to upgrade my GPU have
an old 962 gig when do you think GPU
prices will go down and what pairs best
with the jeans with the sorry the 1602
the resin 1600 um I don't know when GPU
prices will go down to what they were
before the crypto mining craze I really
don't I don't follow that very closely
just it happens when it happens to me um
going with a 1600 I would say gtx 1070
in below RX you mix deck interim
upgrades for stuff that maybe isn't like
upgrading to the best of the best of
what's available right now but something
that's much better than a 962 gig like a
GTX 970 you might be able to find a good
deal on and that would be a nice jump
from a 962 gig to a 970 3.5 gig yeah
other than that look for stuff that's
not super popular when it comes to
cryptocurrency like a 1060 you might be
able to find a better deal on a three
gig or six gig or if you're interested
in investing a bit more money than wait
for 1070 prices to come down because in
my opinion that's still kind of where
you get the best bang for your buck yeah
at least if you can find one that's at a
reasonable price
indeed hypothetical pizza 5 bucks
I was joking I have a degree I'm not
that desperate yet okay I believe you
you sound kind of desperate
just saying hypothetically like some
pizza soon mmm it's a Fred ranch once
again $5 yes because your initial
donation was not enough Fred that Fred
