given away for the 12-hour charity
stream Nepal and I did and we actually
put it in the backseat of wifey sauces
car at some point once we got home wifey
sauce didn't want the PC visible in her
backseat which is understandable so she
unbeknownst to me took the system out of
the backseat and placed it in her trunk
not tied down or anything like that and
then the next day I have to go run
errands but her car's blocking mine in
the driveway so I just end up taking her
car I'm running around town all day I
get home then two days later she tells
me so usually I'm semi joking when I say
this but truly this time around this is
all your fault yes yes it is this is
literally 0% my fault for once in my
life you get all the credit here here it
is
see the damage Oh
oh my god the front panel it's the front
panel did you check anything else are
all the other parts okay honey look at
all the glass how are you gonna clean
this all up without my help don't bat
your eyes at me like that
we're married that doesn't work anymore
all right so I guess we're gonna take in
my car for today we'll deal with this
later
seconds later wife you saw spills water
all over my car wait you can't you can't
get you can't yell at me in front of the
camera you can't yell me in front of the
camera I'll report you I have evidence
husband abuse you're right I love you I
said I love you okay the thermal take a
500 aluminum TG mid-tower features a
sleek aluminum front panel and two four
millimeter tempered glass panels for
breathtaking views enjoy 420 and 360 rad
support at the front and top
respectively and breeze through
installation with the dismantle Abul
modular design step up your case game
with the a500 aluminum TG and click on
the link below for more info
take me to Starbucks I need you always
go to Starbucks you can go one morning
without I need coffee decaf flavor I'm
addicted to it's like getting marijuana
with all the THC out of it
smoking literal grass get the good stuff
at least I'm gonna make a pit stop for a
grass weed no you have too much power
I'm gonna do a drive-thru I know but I
have my makeup that I use this is
getting worse by the second so many
traps we're never gonna get any good
today while we're waiting for wifey
thoughts when I give you an interior
look at my car it is in LB RS 3 there is
no 3 there though we're three there you
go this is a steering wheel it's got
buttons buttons on the steering wheel to
go whoop Dee whooping whooping whoo you
also get a little cool air conditioner
you little clicky clicky ring singing
looks like a little cool duster cool is
death forever could it cool here now
over here you've got full mount for foam
I bought that separately didn't come
with one course that you rip off go big
shift stick here there's always on the
tour smoothing if you look really hard
look really hard you can see yourself in
there magical then you got more
clickety-clack ease and knobby knobby so
I hear there's a nice tea he's got more
stitching I think there's another Rs
here and then we got the screen screens
really nice you can do the clicky real
to anything neat there's a towel that
didn't come with the car and there's
more RS thingies on here I think most
people who buy this car forget what it
is
so the Audi's gotta put our s everywhere
so they don't forget and then you've
also got fenders of fresh cool park
unless you put stuff I got my L ties in
there geez finally bored out of my mind
in here so what are we doing
darling pasta no I'm talking to the
beavers not here we are doing house
stuff we had lunch we go to lunch right
now then we're gonna meet with a plumber
the entire plumbing of the house needs
to be replaced it's still original
galvanized or at least most of it is
still galvanized steel so we're gonna
swap it all out for copper the whole
process should take anywhere from three
to five days all the plumbers doing some
prep work quite the sauce and I are
gonna go out shopping for some new
shower fixtures because the house is
really updated and we have to make sure
that it's all compatible with the new
pipes that plumber is putting in so we
might hit the old home depot so that's
what we're doing today sort of a house
blog and you guys can expect a few more
of these as time goes on because wifey
sauce and I have a lot of work to do on
this house and we can't always work in
the more traditional sense while fixing
up the house at the same time so being
able to mesh the two in a vlog like this
works out really nicely for us then
hopefully you guys get some quality
content out of it but yeah we're gonna
lead the way honey we're going to salute
so this is shabu-shabu it's Japanese
hotpot you pick your broth you think
your protein you get a set of veggies
and you dump it all in your pot it's
kinda like a DIY sort of experience very
tasty all right we are in the costoday
bit wit now and we just met with the
plumber he's actually gonna start
tomorrow
officially which means our first end of
the day is to actually make a duplicate
copy of our house key so that he can let
himself in when we're not around so this
is actually the perfect opportunity to
replace all of these fixtures the master
bathroom is actually on the opposite
side of this wall so they're sharing
this wall right here which is kind of
good because the plumber now only has to
punch holes in this wall to access both
fixtures we'll figure it out once we're
shopping around and stuff you know the
third and final errands that we're gonna
try to get done today is swapping out a
couple of these ceiling fans for one
this is gonna be our designated shooting
area that's like the studio room where
I'm gonna be filming most of the time
and I've got you know large studio
lights with softboxes c-stands and
things like that which actually reach up
pretty high so this is really low
clearance like the fact that I can touch
this right you know the fact that I can
touch it just shows how how low it is so
we're actually gonna have to swap that
out for a regular light and go shopping
around for one of those and then we've
got our master bedroom here which also
has this really ugly super dated looking
ceiling fan that we'll have to swap out
as well because it is again super low
and it's just kind of masked it will
keep the bulbs bulbs are great doesn't
really do it justice on camera but this
thing is things messed up that's
it's on our to-do list for today it
should be pretty straightforward and
it's pretty much it so what's wifey's
let's do it you lock him up yeah read do
this let's do it oh my girl dance white
girl dance
oh wow too far that's where we crossed
the line okay alright so it's a bit
further away but you know if we can get
all three errands potentially done at
one spot we're just gonna go to the Home
Depot screw it Hardware pun I think this
might be the very first time in my life
I've ever gotten a cart at Home Depot
he's usually when I come here it's for
like you know one little thingamajig but
now we're playing with the big leagues
the flat one yeah that looks fine I mean
it looks better than the one next to
that one looks like a boob definitely
LED is good I were just gonna go with a
two pack of this 13 hundred and 60
lumens says it's equivalent to three
sixty watt bulbs which should be bright
enough for those rooms they're not
terribly big yeah let's just do this
alright shower fixtures we have to pick
a set that has three knobs for the guest
bathroom Oh for the master sorry and
they only have two options right here in
the top corner
wifey sawsan I don't really like the
first one so we're probably gonna go
with that one that's our only option
unfortunately we don't like the
showerhead it's a little lousy so we
might actually just buy a dedicated
showerhead separately and swap that out
now we do have some more options for the
guest bathroom wifey sauce doesn't like
the shiny fixture she thinks too shiny
they showed dirt a little bit more so
we're probably gonna go with something
more matte maybe like this one on top or
something like that
alright dump them in yep and then D 28
this is for the master bathroom the ugly
showerhead fell a little ugly in there
maybe we should get a different
showerhead there alright we have a lot
of head options here oh these are the
hoses you don't want to hose you know
down with the hose what about the one
that looks like a case fan no no no the
big one oh you would want the Kohler
$34 do you think money grows on trees
this is basic this is just like is it a
basic is it the Kohler basic line cooler
now for four people
alright let's get your stupid sunflower
one faucet in okay so we tried to
duplicate the key but we failed because
they actually don't sell blanks that say
do not duplicate on them which we
definitely want for our house key so we
have to go somewhere else but we're done
here so let's check out
Archy did I didn't really vlog that
because it really was much to it can I
say didn't I say can you just focus on
the road please so now we get to sit to
traffic no no yeah bumper to bumper
traffic because someone made the wrong
turn
no it's cuz it's nice little detour of
this city that we don't know much about
it's nice long scenic route never
noticed that
freeway bridge before beautiful can you
please get in this lane so we need a
screwdriver the new house is completely
empty so it has no tools in it I didn't
bring any tools and now we have to go to
a hardware store to get a screwdriver so
that we can install the light fixtures
you know we should also buy one ladder
Aladdin
blu-ray between VHS we just streaming
unless you've had a planner I didn't
mean the ladder and that's what I said
you're an eyesore anybody I would choose
your words very carefully
okay Princess Jasmine we also have to
get a broom if he saw spawns to actually
sweep our driveway because there's a
bunch of leaves and stuff falling from
the big trees that are on a front the
question is will she go with the AMD
broom or the NVIDIA broom I mean AMD
one's probably a better value three more
must be on sale why do you like the
green one better though probably runs
cooler I feel like this one will treat
its customers better though I'm so torn
is this the one you're getting final
answer fanboy okay I need a short person
ladder which means I need a really tall
ladder either these look pretty together
about the same height how much is this
one this is $100 and the other one is 50
ish 50 ish tall he's almost half price
so what does that mean does that mean
I'm definitely gonna die on that one
actually a question about these two
ladders cuz they look about the same but
this one's twice as expensive as that
one what's the benefit with the
fiberglass it's just not conductive or
something okay cool all right so yeah I
will die on this one then especially if
we push different changing lights so we
might have a little bit of a problem
here I was hoping to go to town on these
light fixtures right now but I don't
think I can because it's getting really
dark you know it gets dark really early
these days in fact it's getting dark
really quick now it's already 5:00
it doesn't look so bad on camera but
that's just because the low-light sensor
but in person it's kind of hard to see
in here honestly also this is an empty
house we don't have any other external
lights or battery-operated lights that
we could use to help us and obviously we
have to keep this light off while I'm
working on it because of safety reasons
we might have to raincheck this so that
kind of sucks well we can't really do
much else here we have to wait for the
plumber to install those so really the
only thing I can show you right now is
wyfy sauce sweeping the driveway
all right it's officially dark but it's
only 611 which means there is a metric F
ton of traffic right now on our way home
to my grandparents place and we don't
want to wait an hour or two in traffic
right now so we have to find something
else to do in the area of our new house
we don't really have any ideas so movie
is there anything good playing though am
I gonna just watch some crap movie
Aquaman Aquaman any good I've known
again I'm not gonna watch some crap
movie I'm really really not good right
now how about you Mary why don't we go
for a swim on the Thames 64 percent that
is not three yes tomato barely that's
like getting a C in a class 82% audience
approval barely passing in fact a 64 in
school would be a D because it's a
Transformers movie it'll be good
where's your logic there bumblebee you
got 93% bumblebee yes about the car the
transformer cars look 93% wait
spider-man got 97 but this is a
different spider-man he's into the
spider verse that's got to be better
than the spider chorus wait to see
bumblebee it's different
mmm-hmm okay okay I'm gonna watch the
stupid bumblebee trailer just to see if
there's any chance I might want to see
it huh oh it's not loading sorry I can't
look at look at that no that's okay we
can just not see it
this is this is basically et but with a
car instead of a wrinkly old alien man's
I mean bumblebees really cute but now we
get to buy beer this nice nice bar here
at the ArcLight cinema very swanky are
we ready to do this
sure let's go I like the fist Theatre
has assigned seats its orderly also
we're in like the perfect position to
just film the whole movie and then sell
it on the Internet are you trying to get
our channel so that it's already dead
alright what did you think of it what
score would you give it I give it a 10
that's pretty good it's pretty
entertaining it was funny I like this
one way more than any of the transformer
ones by far it seemed more just like a
regular movie and not just all about
transformers and explosions and they
were really good action scenes but they
weren't over-the-top or in your face as
much as the other ones it wasn't like
you were seeing an explosion every 5
seconds it had a lot of heart - it is
very heartfelt but not in a cringy way
necessarily was actually pretty good it
reminded me of a live-action version of
The Iron Giant oh yeah which is a great
movie so if you like the Iron Giant just
check out bubble b.o.b was good I liked
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
