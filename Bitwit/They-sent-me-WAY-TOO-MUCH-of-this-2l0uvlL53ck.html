first three letters of a California
license plate
like that one in front of us h HB not
really let's try to mix them up out of
the first
hey how's Bobby I keep wanting to say
burrito at the end just wing it but it
has to make sense
partly hot and heavy burrito about half
of a habanero burrito odd that one
hungry hungry bimbos well make sense
Hilton Hotel bankrupt you're much better
at this than I am maybe you just got the
wrong acronym here let's go behind this
guy EEP very prickly kangaroos see there
you go
Virtual Private Network with the king
vicious primal koalas very purple kite
oh I like that that's good yeah violent
Park nice like a bunch of dudes Narmer
hanging out of bark nailed a oh I just
hit my head holy hell you recording yes
did you get that on camera
maybe that's what's really important
here what did you want to say to the
camera right now um I have to introduce
the vlog don't I uh today we are running
some errands like it
nope that was boring wife is Austin I
are gonna run around town today we do
have some errands to take care of first
starters we're going to our old office
we have to actually pick up a couple
packages that came after we moved out
and then we've got to go to Home Depot
we got to pick up some last-minute items
from my grandpa's place
I can't park in there anymore it's open
its open its open oh it's open
oh the arms open obviously we don't have
our key cards anymore but it looks like
the arm is up we can just drive on
through completely free of charge
alright lots of things to do today let's
get again I know they've only been moved
out of here for about a week but it
already feels weird to be back here yes
I feel a visitor we are we are visitors
aliens wait is it locked
oh cool all right so this is this is our
old room since we're here and it's
unlocked and we have a box from who is
this from it's actually from Corsair
alright so here take this so for old
times sake I'm gonna do one last
unboxing in our studio I think you got
it oh my god interface material four
days they send us so much not the verge
actually heard this stuff cools really
well yeah hi grandpa I'm good how are
you okay good well I was wondering if I
could come by really quick to pick up
the last of our things
okay I'll see you soon everybody okay
okay we will bye
all right we had to go to the bank first
to get their security deposit I want to
give them some cash the cats completely
destroyed part of the carpet and
actually there's some hot lime juice
cuz it's actually left a pretty piece in
the state as well they also might need
to repaint some walls that have been
stuffed up you know normal wear and tear
stuff so to the mic
okay so wifey sauce just heard me
singing to myself as I usually do and I
was singing Theo's Buster's song and I
said that one line that says bust didn't
makes me feel good she actually doesn't
believe me that that's part of the
cybermen she had a dirty mind thought I
was talking about something else which I
clearly was it it was just staying true
to the theme song so we're gonna really
verify it right now I'm gonna play you
just a few seconds of the song so we
don't get copyright strike it seems to
be a trend right now just to prove to
white Vsauce
that that is in fact the line that they
say in the song strange
it might be towards the end of the
supper but I promise it's going to song
alright soon see I don't have a dirty
mind
um in mind you do have a dirty mind
that's why that's the only line you sing
yeah words nothing makes me feel good
makes me feel good it makes you laugh
because you know it's a little dirty
yeah for me if you know me or something
I do so I got married to you look you
get me right we're at the bank I'll be
right back dolla dolla bills y'all
oh you are not happy with that are you
hundo all right we're at my grandpa's
house and this is the Box I was looking
for all right we've got a bunch of stuff
from the old office including Trident
gum always good to have they've also got
the black posts that were mounted to the
wall these were holding the wooden
shelves up in the background of a set
hopefully I can find a place for these

with four cameras we're gonna be setting
up at various points around the house
