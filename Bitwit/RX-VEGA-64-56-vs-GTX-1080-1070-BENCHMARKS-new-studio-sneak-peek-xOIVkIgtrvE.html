noisy I can't sleep do I at least get a
bedtime story fine once upon a time
there was a tiny little boy who couldn't
fall asleep loud noises scared him and
made him wet the bed
everyone goes with their own pace cough
anyway one day the little boy found a
magical cake called the define see by
crackle design impressed by the
minimalistic Scandinavian design he
hopped decide to investigate the
interior the case was rooming without
being too big offering plenty of room
for him to frolic and play her little
boy was a maid from Oleg get you
strapped in ample cooing Airport and
then he saw whole logs for alder liquid
coins here the best part was a large
side panel window so he didn't have to
be afraid of the dark
the little boy built happily ever after
the case your dreams is finally here
click the link of the description to
learn more about the defined see from
fractal design
Duden Duden Duden Duden Duden Duden
Duden or now why hello Vega looking good
now you guys probably already caught my
crappy unboxing of Vega last week but
now we finally get to talk numbers let's
talk about performance benchmarks useful
information finally these cards are
viable they are on the market on store
shelves so this is an air-cooled rx Vega
64 which should be priced at 499
if it's not then I'm sorry AMD has lied
to you and of course once the Adhan
board partner variants come out that
will likely increase the price as well
but for now for the sake of on spec
specs on paper this is $500 is a 500
hour card and it's going to be competing
against the GTX 1080 because right now
on Amazon the cheapest 1080 that I found
five hundred and thirty dollars about
$30 more than the RX Vega 64 air-cooled
model assuming that it is in fact $500
at the time of launch so we're going to
be comparing these two cards today
they're sort of you know arch-nemesis if
you will and then we've also got this
card this is the RX Vega 56 a slightly
cut-down version of the Vega 64 they're
both using the same Vega 10 GPU it still
has eight gigs of HP m2 and that sort of
thing but it does have a slower clock
speed and fewer streaming processors and
that sort of thing I've already talked
about all the specs between these two
cards on previous video so you can go
ahead and check that out if you're if
you're curious and at the price point of
three hundred and ninety-nine dollars
one hundred dollars cheaper than Vega 64
the ERX Vega 56 competes directly with
nvidia geforce gtx 1070 so we're going
to be competing these two cards against
each other as well so it's kind of a
dual duel haha that that works perfectly
as i'm so proud of myself for making
that pads on the back throw had done the
back now fun fact
AMD did release a sort of beta driver to
the press that would allow us to
manually overclock Vega but I received
that way after I had already benchmarked
these cards and thus I did not have time
to overclock them manually for this
video however there is a turbo mode that
I enabled within wot man the Radeon
software so that I we do get sort of a
boost here and I was actually seeing
clock speeds up to sixteen hundred and
thirty megahertz for Vega 64 and I think
high 1500s there abouts for 56 so while
I didn't manually overclock and tweak
things myself there was that turbo mode
enabled for all of today's tests for the
geforce cards i gave each of them a 150
megahertz core clock offset and 300
megahertz memory clock offset that
basically took them over to gigahertz
with the core clock speed during our
test so everything's running more or
less overclocked
in their own fun way and it should be a
pretty fair fight overall we're testing
1080p 1440p and 4k so three resolutions
very common resolutions no ultra why
resolutions for today but yeah let's
take a look at the testbed that we're
using actually it's pretty swanky this
is the same one that I used for Fred
River recently at least on the Intel
side what it was what the Red River was
competing against it's the MSI x2 99
gaming Pro carbon a lovely motherboard
plenty of carbon so carbon accents and
things like that a 32 gig kit of g.skill
trident z RGB running at 3200 speed and
I should talk about the processor really
quick that's a 70 900 X core I nine from
Intel overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz on
all 10 of its beautiful course we've
also got that cooled by a corsair h 110
i liquid cooler 280 millimeter AIO
other things to note here we are using
in a data SX 900 512 gig SSD no m dot 2
nothing fancy just a plain ol SATA drive
and yeah that's pretty much it so guys I
know this isn't the most professional
video I've ever done but I wanted to
keep it really simple because again I'm
super busy with other things like this
amazing studio that I should show you
guys really quickly heat look at look at
look at this little cabinet this is the
best cabinet in the world this is the
best investment I ever made it's 4 feet
wide and much taller than I am but
there's just so much room for activities
in here I absolutely love it got all my
camera gear over here just a bunch of
crap that used to be like just exploded
all over my old room that's now neatly
organized with you know the label maker
and stuff all the custom water coals or
some of the custom water cooled stuff is
in here there's two more rooms guys
there's two more rooms to this office
that I have not shown you yet so stay
tuned for that I'll be showing that in a
different video it'll be a more
comprehensive tour than this pretty
pretty sparse right now this is just
enough to be functional
there's no flair added yet so I'm going
to do an ultimate gaming desk set up on
this wall which is going to be the new
background of all my videos and there's
gonna be stuff on the walls there will
be a nice big like up-and-down desk
hopefully right here for specifically
just for doing builds on kind of got a
shelf here I'll put some more tools and
easy access things there this is where
all the camera equipment goes tripods
lights we're going to get a new lighting
set everything is going to be super cool
so this is basically the workshop room
and then the room that's sharing this
wall that's on the other side of this
wall is
sort of the office space and there's one
small dinky room that's all storage so
we're going to take a look at those
later on but I had gotten way off track
I just felt like I needed to update you
guys really quickly because you guys
have been asking so much about what are
we going to see the new studio Kyle
thought we're friends bro dude it's been
weeks I haven't been able to sleep at
night you'll be the studio or da so now
you've seen it
or at least part of the current that
digression was Jay approved but
seriously getting back on topic here
let's run some benchmarks here I'm using
the latest drivers by the way
well obviously the press drivers that
AMD provided for the the Vega cards and
then the latest driver not the beta not
the beta that's out right now but the
one just before that let's just go ahead
and check which one it is because I
don't member off the top of my head
Version three eight 4.9 four without
further ado guys here are your
benchmarks for the gtx 1070 1080 RX vega
56 and 64
you
all right guys let's break this down in
numbers we can understand here's a look
at the total number of frames rendered
across all of our games and resolutions
between the four cards along with our
frames per dollar in green at the right
there just so we can get an idea of what
kind of value these cards are offering
on the bottom half of the chart we see
that the gtx 1070 performance-wise was
actually about 4% faster than the vega
56 which is kind of a bummer however if
you look at the dollar amount the
cheapest gtx 1070 I could find on Amazon
at the time of filming was 450 dollars
or about 12.5% more expensive than what
a vega 56 reference model will retail
for at launch again that's assuming that
it is going to retail for $400 and not
some you know inflated launch price but
if that is the case then we're seeing a
much better value with Vega at 3.2 for
fpd vega 56 to be exact
over the 3.0 FPD offered by the gtx 1070
now even if you're chasing the most
performance at this price point you
still might want to consider vega 56
simply if you're in the market for an
adaptive refresh rate display as
freesync panels right now are much
cheaper than they're g-sync equivalents
so at the end of the day you could still
be getting just about the same
performance just a little bit less than
the gtx 1070 but also walk out of the
store with more money in your pocket if
you happen to be purchasing a monitor as
well if a gaming display is not a
consideration and you're just throwing
in on the GPUs themselves I really can't
recommend one or the other I feel like
you know the price and performance the
additional price and performance that
you get with the gtx 1070 it pretty much
scales evenly over vega 56 so it's
really up to you if you want to spend
that additional you know couple you know
30 40 50 bucks to get that 4 percent
more performance that's a totally valid
choice however if you want to save a
little bit more for slightly less
performance vega 56 offers a phenomenal
value at this price now taking a look at
vega 64 and the gtx 1080
they actually have a completely
different relationship than the 1070 and
50 in vega 56 for starters the gtx 1080
completely annihilates the vega 64 in
performance we're seeing about an 18%
increase in average frame rates overall
in the 6 games we tested which is a
pretty crushing victory for nvidia here
at this price point of 500
dollars plus we're also seeing a better
value overall with the GT X 1080 giving
us 3.1 frames per dollar
whereas Vega 64 was the only car that we
tested today that did not break the
three fpd barrier which is kind of
disappointing you'll also notice that
while Vega 64 is 25% more expensive than
Vega 56 it's only about 9% faster which
means it's kind of being cannibalized by
its own cut-down kin and that's
obviously not going to be very appealing
for people even if they have the $500 to
shake at their GPU from what I'm seeing
here Vega 64 is a pretty tough sell at
this point whereas Vega 56 is a solid
buy at it's $400 price you know what's
really interesting that everyone
including myself was super excited about
vega 64 that's all we could freaking
talk about for the last few months and
then it turns out that the unsung hero
of this story is actually vega 56 I mean
it's just it's got the right price and
performance the price performance are
just where they need to be in order to
stay competitive with the gtx 1070 the
vega 56 card is not quite as competitive
with the gtx 1080
as i initially thought it was but vega
56 is a is a great Buy and i've been
recommending the gtx 1070 to people for
so long it's nice to actually have
another alternative to recommend folks
who are looking for a graphics card in
that price range overall very solid card
from it from AMD vega 64 try harder and
that's pretty much all I have to say for
now guys go ahead and let me know what
you guys think about Vega in the
comments below and very cute to hear
