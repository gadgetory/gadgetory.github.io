look at the new and improved Diamondback
gaming mouse from Razer the original DB
debuted back in 2004 and grew to be one
of the most well known gaming mice of
its generation well over a decade later
its diamondback with the re-engineered
design and some new tricks up its sleeve
including razor's full RGB chroma
backlighting now while I don't have
extensive experience with the original I
can tell you that the revamp uses a
similar ambidextrous body with forward
and back buttons on either side sports a
pair of standard click buttons and a
clickable scroll wheel over all the
mouse sports a simple design which stays
mostly true to the original on a scale
of 1 to 10 I'd give the comfort level a
6 for me personally being a claw grip
user myself I generally prefer my mice
to have a bit more arch I like I'm with
them curves and the Diamondback body is
really too flat for my taste
granted this is a preference thing and I
think calm rest users are much more
likely to enjoy the feel of this Mouse
than the rest of us that being said the
small rubber side grips are tapered
inwards with the rest of the body making
them difficult to actually get a hold of
factor in the lighting strip that's
replaced the rubber grip ring from the
original and you'd swear you were
playing viscera cleanup detail with an
actual bar of soap it's a pretty
slippery Mouse again coming from a claw
grip users point of view
fortunately you get some top notch
switches that deliver solid feeling
clicks all around with the perfect
amount of actuation force that is when
their buttons you actually intend to
click one caveat I encountered with the
ambidextrous design is that my ring
finger tends to accidentally click the
outer forward button when I go to use
the inner forward button this happens
especially often when my hand goes
berserk in a frantic firefight which for
me is really out of character in the
first place while you can disable any
button in the software to prevent
unwanted actions taking place the sound
and feel of these infrequent miss clicks
can get annoying pretty quickly that
being said there's a satisfying click to
the scroll wheel which is lined with
textured rubber and Scrolls beautifully
with tactile bumps for tasks like
switching weapons in game not
necessarily a con but something to bear
in mind is if a mouse beers on the
lighter side with no weight tuning
option so heavy handed gamers might want
to look elsewhere
you can see there's also no shortage of
LED accents on this thing
everything from the scroll wheel to the
palm Razer logo to the seamless ring
that wraps around the body is
independently customizable in the
software but more on that later when it
comes to precision and accuracy Razer
has this one in the diamond bag oh I'll
get you I'll get you eventually the
16,000 dpi 5g laser sensor is wicked
fast precise and tracks noticeably
better than my Logitech G 500 with it
you get up to 210 inches of travel per
second 50 G's of acceleration and a 1000
Hertz polling rate via the 7-foot rated
USB cable now apart from getting
acquainted with the hardware this review
also marks my first experience with the
Razer synapse software which is just as
much a part of this product as the mouse
itself and here you can import export
and create custom profiles for different
button actions lighting effects and
settings once you've created or imported
a profile you can start remapping your
buttons to perform virtually any action
macros dpi adjustment program launching
and profile switching to name a few the
suite gives you full control over X&amp;amp;Y
laser sensitivity acceleration and you
can even enable surface calibration
based on your mouse pad there's also an
entire stats area where you can track
your mouse clicks and in-game actions to
provide deeper insight to your clicking
hotspots moving patterns and while
you're still single
as I mentioned earlier a prominent
differentiator of the new Diamondback is
the incorporation of RGB lighting and
the software does a nice job of making
it easy to trick out your mouse the LEDs
themselves are bright accurate and
incredibly rich in color making my k70
RGB look like it stopped giving a shit
the software's chroma configurator
displays a top-down diagram of your
mouse where you can select which parts
you wish to edit I was pretty impressed
to find that you can also isolate
different sections of the surrounding
LED strip and apply unique lighting
effects to any region making the
possibilities that much more limitless
among your typical static effect for
applying a single unchanging color
breathing mode pulses one or two colors
ominously at your desired speed here you
can choose to have the effect activated
upon mouse click or set it to run
indefinitely reactive lighting is a
single color effect that only activates
upon mouse clicks choose the color and
duration of the effect and you're good
to go
spectrum cycling simply cycles through
others of the spectrum and while it's a
neat effect the preset blocks off the
speed and activation tweaking that we
saw with breathing mode by far the most
customizable and wowing effect in the
bunch is wave a lighting trick notorious
for being plastered on every RGB
keyboard ever going above and beyond
your basic rainbow wave with adjustable
speed and activation properties synapse
lets you add up to seven colors change
the stop distance between them set color
width delay between cycles and wave
direction there's even a split feature
which I still don't know what that does
if all of these options are making your
head hurt by now just look at what the
mouse is going through and during an
endless barrage of piercing light for
your optical titillation I kind of know
how he feels
speaking frankly though synapse is a
well thought out program that gets the
job done and then some but it's not
without its faults for starters the
pop-up window for button remapping can't
be moved and neither can the main window
while it's open which limits some
visibility also in the button mapping
tab the numbers representing the forward
and back buttons on the mouse diagram
are in descending order from top to
bottom but ascending order in the
left-hand list calling nitpicky but this
just seems counterintuitive my only
other critique here is the sectional
grid around the mouse diagram in chroma
configurator is rendered much too light
and I find myself having to squint when
selecting individual cells apart from a
few innocuous shortcomings synapse
offers an overwhelming number of
possibilities particularly with LEDs and
the execution of lighting effects here
are some of the best I've seen among
gaming peripherals now be that as it may
blingy lights aren't for everyone so the
LEDs can be turned off if you prefer a
stealthy diamond too black on that notes
I can see you're all about to pull the
curtain on me so to sum up I feel very
strongly about the software the accent
lighting and the awesome sensor and I
think those are all welcome additions to
the Diamondback lineage that most gamers
will appreciate on the other hand the
flat and slippery body design just isn't
for me and I'd only consider
recommending this mouse to pierpon
rescue tzer's or for gamers who need the
ambidexterity but let me know what you
guys think of the new Diamondback and
how you think it stacks up to the
original</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
