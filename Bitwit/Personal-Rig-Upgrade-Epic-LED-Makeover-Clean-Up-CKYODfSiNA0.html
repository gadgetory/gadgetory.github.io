today's video is going to revolve
primarily around hot line back here my
custom water-cooled PC that I built a
few months ago what am I going to be
doing to it well I'm going to be
upgrading it because as decked out as it
is from top to bottom in terms of
hardware the one thing that is lacking
here in my opinion is the lighting
situation you can see I do have some
lighting over here I've got some little
under glow strips right here as well as
on the inside and you can tell from the
inside of the system that it's actually
a pink gray and black color scheme that
I went with but the lights on the other
hand are kind of like an in-between pink
and purple ish blend and it kind of
looks a little bit off I was really
happy about it at first but it really
was the closest I could find to the pink
fluid and the pink cable slaving that's
inside of the case so I kind of settle
my they're really cheap II LED strips
single color they're not RGB so that's
why today I'm going to be upgrading hot
line with the NZXT Q plus RGB custom led
kit and Thing Thing is it's cool I
actually did a really extensive review
on this thing it's like half an hour
long check it out if you want
Demitri from hardware connects also also
just launched his review on the Q plus
and it's really good super concise he
gets all the important information in
there and obviously the b-roll looks
really good as they usually do on
Hardware kinetics um but that's
primarily the focus of today's video so
without rambling too much further I
think the first challenge that I'm going
to have to overcome today is where to
actually put this thing because there's
no more space in the hard drive cages
they're all populated there's no there's
no room for this thing so I'm gonna have
to again McGavin some and see if we
can actually get this thing in there in
the first place otherwise this whole
video is kind of a moot point let's get
started on that alright let's go ahead
and get started and we'll shut down shut
down alright apart from upgrading
hotline I also forgot to mention that
it's it's about time for a good cleaning
as well so I'm not going to take things
out obviously but I'm just going to give
it a good spray down a nice little wipe
down as well and hopefully get this
thing a little bit less dusty than it is
currently
Ben Wow it's been a while since hot line
had a bath you're a dirty dancing know
what that means
it sounds dirty all right yes you are
quite dusty aren't you it was a good
hard look at the right side of the
system you can see I've got like tape
there should never be tape unless this
electrical tape there should never be
like scotch tape in a frickin computer
bill but there you go
I actually had to snip some of the
wiring for the LED strips that are in
here and then route them into a molex
connector coming from my power supply to
power the damn things super ghetto it's
somehow worked I've got more tape up
here it's just nasty it's just
disgusting how do you live like that so
I'm gonna go ahead and rip the out
oh yeah way to do that for a while
member kids pulling out as it fast I
don't even care that I'm ruining these
LED strips because I will never use them
again
good riddance this is also tape these
are just taped on here because the
adhesive that came with these LED strips
is just so horrible how are you so heavy
damn you too fat you're clearly American
PC I wanted to go just this off have to
bring it to the bathroom we're outside
first and then I'll be right back
 it should I do it here I got
this I probably should have done this
first idiot but you already knew that
getting them to be 750 series is a
little tricky cuz how much space they
have so much up the clock p.m. and
I'm from a friend it's really clean
don't wanna just to PPE no let me remind
you that you can stop watching this
video anytime you want this way to sit
over here
clears on top of you quizzes you take
the dog out back and shoot Jenna for me
he's dead he's a devil town ready
really zooming Christina dust it just
filter that's not really that dusty
that's it
my bad I'll be right back
you look down EMI good good good good
good good good good good good good
good as new you got his Balu well I
didn't realize this video would be so
reliant on the cleaning aspect come on
forgot there's no dust filter in the
front dieter maybe I'll just slip a
finger on there all right we got the hue
plus out of monks we got four LED strips
to play around with here so we've got a
few options
don't we we could either put all four
LED strips inside of the case which is
probably what most people would do um
you saw that with my older le LED strips
I actually had two of them on the bottom
we showed that earlier in the video so I
could put two of them on the bottom and
two of them in the case I don't know
what I'm gonna do yeah no gasps doom
next we're gonna go ahead and try to
figure out a place to put this guy you
can see I've got it's fully loaded back
here you know if I really need it to
cram not even it's just too thick it's
just way too thick if I'm going to fit
so what we're gonna do is flip it around
to the fruit yes uh-huh we could just
put it right here that looks ugly
that looks ugly let's do that or we
could put it on the side of the power
supply that actually don't look too bad
I really wish that the this didn't have
this like semi glossy finish on the
front because it is a bit more
reflective makes it stand out more I
guess that was the point
NZXT was trainable but I don't like it
all that much and it's okay and then
maybe we could put it maybe we could put
at the bottom maybe it'll be a bottom
feeder right under the freakin brows
since there's really no room and I'm
having flashbacks now remembering why
the LED layout initially was the way it
was because there's really no room up
top for any LED strips that's why I had
one in the back one on the bottom
that was pretty much all I can do I
could however throw one at the front
here so I have two on the inside on the
sides and then one on the bottom I think
that would provide the most even amount
of lighting however I should be taking
into consideration how how long the
strip's going to be in total once I
connect it and Chuck yeah just think
about that
slick not you look you're cool so we
actually might need to use all forward
I'll forward ease buyer boers okay I
think I'm gonna do that
guys I think the bottom LEDs are gonna
have to wait for a later time maybe I'll
do a part two to this video let me know
if you think I should still try to get
some under glow in there but I think
this is gonna look pretty sweet this is
a pretty sweet deal I'm glad that the
four included strips that that we've got
actually cover most of the case here
what been cool if there was a two and a
half inch mount right at the bottom of
the case I mean just for this reason
really but it's cool okay we'll just go
ahead and put some velcro wrap I our
minor all right I've got it in there
looks like the velcro is adhering
properly and I think we're good to go
man
frickin q+ installed whoo all right
y'all so Before we jump into the
software and start getting our groove on
I just want to give you a close-up look
at the interior of the case what I've
done with the LED strips you can see all
four of them go perfectly around the
three edges of the computer chassis and
then we've also got the unit right here
so I did the best I could with cable
management it's pretty since it's so low
like literally at the very bottom it's
pretty hard to even see when the side
panels on and then of course the unit
itself now it just happened to work out
that the white LED is facing away from
from me or from the side panel so you
can actually see it's definitely
illuminated there but since it's a
mounted this way you can't really see it
which i think is great
I think I'm really glad that I don't
have to show off that white LED because
it might interfere with the rest of my
color scheme you know what I'm saying
you know I'm saying so there's just a
quick look at the internals so you can
kind of get an idea of what we're
working with here so why don't we go
ahead and jump into the software all
right so now hot line is
set up we are in the cam software it's a
NZXT in-house program to configure all
of our lighting modes and effects and
things like that
so you can see right now the system is
not lit up at all even though the LED
strips are on there we just have the
LEDs disabled at the moment so we're
just going to go through the list of
presets here and I've already kind of
configured create custom profiles within
each of these that just to save time
starting off with the basics we've got a
fixed LED mode right now as you can see
it's all the way on black I've gone
ahead and played around with a few
colors the first one being white it's
very neutral obviously and you can
really see the innards of this system
the best I think with white lighting so
this is definitely a contender just to
go with a simple white lighting next up
we have the fuchsia color that I tried
to replicate the color of the liquid the
fluid as best I could now even though
it's maybe not 100% perfect this is
still way closer to the the pink in hot
line than the old LED strips that I had
previously so I'm actually really
digging this fuchsia I'm also going to
be revisiting it on in some of the other
future lighting modes that we have here
next up we've got sky blue and even
though there isn't a hint of blue in
this entire rig this is just kind of an
overall desc theme that I've ended up
going with my desktop background is kind
of a blend of this color and that
fuchsia that we were looking at and also
my k70 RGB kind of does a breathing
effect between these two colors as well
so I don't know why but these are just
totally like hotline Miami colors and I
think even though there's no blue in the
system I think it still accentuates it
quite well and it kind of complements
the the existing pink that's in there so
I think between this fuchsia and white
those are probably the three main colors
that we're going to be messing around
with
for the most part so moving on to
breathing this is just again a really
simple I'm gonna change this blue here
this is just a really simple breathing
effect I actually I like fading a bit
better because you'll notice the
breathing it the lights dim all the way
before they go back up and I don't know
I'm just not a big fan of that if
there's lighting in the case I want it
to always be on I don't like it to fade
out and then come back on I just think
it's a bit distracting for me so moving
on to fading now I thought this was kind
of a cool idea so this is kind of a best
of both worlds I'm switching between
fuchsia and white I've named this
profile warm to cool because you do get
kind of both of those color temperatures
with this lighting mode and then moving
on to marquee tool around marquee tool
Wow okay okay Photoshop users this is
the spotlights that I created now
generally the market the way marquee
works is you have a backlight color that
just stays constant so static lights
that lights up on all the LEDs and then
you have a marquee color that kind of
just travels around that that loop so to
speak in a different color what I've
done here is I've actually made the
backlight color black so I've
essentially disabled all LEDs for the
backlighting and then I just made the
marquee color white and you can see I've
named this this one spotlight just
because I think it's kind of a neat idea
having the case pitch black but then
having this one bright white LED
traveling around it and you can see I've
also made the group size of LEDs five
LEDs long covering marquee
very similar to the one we just looked
at but I'm going with an RGB here
instead of having a backlighting the
colors just run they travel one after
the other so there's no real
backlighting there but I just went with
the classic RGB obviously doesn't match
with with the pink it actually looks
kind of hideous but I think this is just
for me more more of a fun option got a
throw if they're RGB LEDs go throw some
or GB in there sometimes right sooner or
later it's going to catch up to you
but that's all for that one pulse
for pulse I just see this as like a
strobe light effect I guess if you go
really slow you can make it more like a
heart beating and you can probably even
you know make it look even more like a
heart if you choose like a warmer color
represents blood or something like that
let's just go pure blood the blood
dripping down pumping through the pipes
I don't know what I'm saying so yeah I
just I don't know I like I kind of like
the strobe light effect with with the
white I think it looks pretty sweet this
is probably as fast as I was I would go
you go any faster than that
pretty much give yourself a seizure and
then we got spectrum wave there's not
much customization you can do here in
terms of color picking because it is
just every color of the spectrum that
that runs through and so yeah you can
really just change the interval out of
the speed and direction so we can go
backwards if you really want to live
life on the edge I'm going backwards
today guys good for you kinda good for
you so yeah this is just a nice mode to
have on hand and then we've got
alternating which i think is my my new
favorite one after playing around with
it you can see I've named this one slot
machine and we've got both our fuchsia
and our blue when I apply that BAM it
just reminds me of a slot machine like I
could just like coins falling out and
everything yeah that's totally what this
is this is exactly like so I've got the
moving emotion on you can see without it
moving the lights just kind of I mean
they alternate but they don't really go
anywhere and that kind of freaks me out
I think the moving just looks a little
bit more seamless less seizure inducing
again got a three LED group size that
just seems to be or I guess the
spotlight was plus five but we've got a
little bit shorter one shorter of a
group size here and it's going pretty
fast going on the fastest mode and we're
going forward we're going forward this
time guessed
and back to our old ways but yeah I
really like this one a lot it kind of
gets both of those nice colors in there
at the same time I think I'm just going
to start playing slot machine sound
effects in the background of all my
videos now and then lastly we've got
candle light which is actually a new
feature that comes to us through a patch
update very recently that that I haven't
seen this until now but this is cool
that NZXT is adding new LED modes to the
software I just I don't know it makes it
seem more worth the hefty premium that
you pay for this thing so I think it's
like 60 bucks but this is kind of a cool
effects it's supposed to replicate the
flame of a candle the flickering flame
of the candle I should say and it comes
default with this nice auburn color but
of course you can change that change
that up to whatever you want although
that didn't work here we go
you can change it to whatever you want
it'll just kind of slowly flicker
there's no speed adjustment for this one
so you know if you wanted to replicate
like a candle flickering in the wind
violently you probably couldn't do that
unless they added it in the future patch
those are pretty much all the led
effects guys um I let me know which one
you guys like the best or if you'd like
me to try something else and maybe I'll
post a video on it on Instagram or
something like that but that's pretty
much gonna conclude it for this video I
think for now I think today today I'm
feeling I'm feeling slot machine I'm
gonna I'm gonna run slot machine today
but who knows what I'll run tomorrow I
already know what I'm gonna do tomorrow
but but I'll never tell
so thank you guys so much for watching
this video go ahead and test me like if
you enjoyed it feel free to subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already more
tech videos coming really soon I promise
and have a merry a very Merry Christmas
I'll probably see you guys again before
then whether it's in a video or some
kind of maybe old periscope or something
like that but yeah thanks for tuning in
guys have a good one and I'll see you
all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
