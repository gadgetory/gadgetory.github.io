today we're taking a closer look at the
glorious AMD built this was the november
pc of the month and in case you missed
part one I'll put a card right over
there you can see the full specs as well
as a nice little time-lapse build but in
this video we're strictly going to be
testing it everything from gaming
performance we've got a slew of
benchmarks lined up as well as acoustics
thermals and all that fun stuff we will
be discussing today so without further
ado why don't we go ahead and move on
over to the data screen right here where
I've got everything all loaded up nice
and fancy alright so starting off with a
look at our GPUs now for those of you
who aren't too familiar with the RX 480
it doesn't exactly have the most ceiling
room when it comes to overclocking in
fact when I tried to overclock these
cards just 2% in AMD watt man I was
crashing every time that was even after
opening a power limit and doing all that
sort of thing so I pretty much just left
them at stock frequencies now I guess I
shouldn't say stock completely because
these are factory overclocked cards so I
basically just left them at their
factory OC setting and I basically got
us a maximum GPU core clock speed of
1300 and 10 megahertz which isn't too
terrible we also had 2000 megahertz on
the GPU memory clock temperatures for
the top card which was the hotter card
of course was 80 degrees Celsius versus
74 T I'm sorry 49 degrees Celsius on the
bottom card now I did see both of these
temperatures rise a little bit higher
when I was doing the the full gamut of
benchmarks that this actually got to 81
degrees on the top card and I believe I
was seeing the bottom card hit like
somewhere in the mid 70s so definitely
not this cold these numbers were
achieved through I would say about half
an hour of Unigine Heaven 4.0 so maybe
not the most indicative of real-world
gaming performance but like I said 81
degrees and 70-something degrees
respectively on those two cards as for
our CPU the FX 95 90 right out of the
box was already turbo to 5 gigahertz you
can see right there in Hardware monitor
I did not do any manual over
overclocking at all and we're getting 5
little over 5 gigahertz there so I
didn't even touch that I actually tried
to go 200 megahertz over that I tried to
you know just just tweak it a little bit
more and just instant instability so I
just completely backed off went back to
stock frequency so yes
this entire system is running stock out
of the box right now there's no manual
overclocking whatsoever like I said I
tried on both the CPU and GPU and it
just wasn't working out so I just
thought screw it it's not worth it
we'll stay a little bit cooler in the
long run anyway better for longevity and
that sort of thing
as far as thermals go don't pay too much
attention to that 46 degrees Celsius
number there that was unige in heaven
4.04 about half an hour like I said but
we were actually seeing closer to 59
degrees Celsius that was the max that I
saw during my testing which is
phenomenally good compared to you I mean
considering how much flak the the FX 95
90 gets for being SuperDuper hot I was I
was expecting at least the high 60s at
the very least but to see it only get up
to 59 degrees Celsius is pretty
impressive granted there have been known
issues with monitoring AMD CPU
temperatures in monitoring software like
Hardware monitor so it could be an
inaccuracy but assuming all things are
nice and correct that's that's a pretty
good score in my opinion of course that
also is a nice testament to the cooler
that we've gotten there which is the
corsair h 100 i GTX v2 and before we
dive straight into the benchmarks I did
want to do a quick little acoustics test
but something to bear in mind before you
take a listen at that is that the case
that we built in the crystal series 570
X from Corsair while it's a very
beautiful and solid case with many
features to boot either something to
bear in mind here look at look at the
the tempered glass side panel and look
at the the gap opening between it and
the rest of the case you can see it's
actually got some space between it it's
a fairly open design I wouldn't call it
an open-air chassis by any means but
there's certainly more space for for air
as well as noise to get through than a
conventional case and this extends all
around the case on all sides pretty much
on both sides as well and it's just it's
just a very open aired case so I want
you guys to bear that in mind when we go
about doing this acoustics test right
after the sound test I'm probably going
to jump straight into the benchmarks and
then we can go ahead and discuss it
really quick and then wrap this video up
you
you
alright y'all so there you guys have it
and based on the results that we just
saw I can't really say that I'm
surprised that we weren't getting
skyrocket through the roof frame rates
if anything I was more or less expecting
us to get mediocre subpar results which
is pretty much what we got in most of
the games tested I think the reason for
that isn't so much the Rx for ATS
granted some games don't crossfire as
well as others or scale and crossfire as
well as others but I think the shortest
straw' in the bunch today was definitely
the FX 95 90 even though it's an 8 core
chip it's got multiple cores on it's got
a core fine but it's just too slow and
too old of it of the CPU to keep up with
the multi-gpu configuration like the RX
4 80s in there so I think we're going to
take away anything today is it's don't
build this exact computer if you want to
go for something similar as far as the
graphic solution is concerned
definitely upgrade the CPU to something
faster like skylake I think a Core i5
and higher would be a much better
solution than the FX 95 90 or you can
wait for KD lake or even Zen if you want
to keep it all on the same AMD platform
and speaking of Zen I think since it's
just around the corner it's either gonna
come later this month or potentially
early next year in January I think maybe
once that that platform is ready I'll
try doing a swap I'll actually take out
the aim 3 plus platform that's currently
in this system plug in a m4 with the CPU
motherboard and ddr4 and stuff and redo
these benchmarks because I think at that
point we're really going to unlock the
full potential of those asus strix cards
right there so I think that'll be a fun
little test let me know what you guys
think about that in the comments but
that is gonna do it for this here video
hopefully you guys enjoyed it be sure to
toss me a look on the video if you did
be sure to so subscribe to the channel
for more tech stuff coming at you really
soon and I'll see y'all in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
