Computex 2016 is brought to you by
gigabyte fantex cable mod and g.skill
without them i would still be at home
with more free time click the links in
the description for more info
these are Corsairs new HD 120 RGB fans
it is quite possibly the coolest demo
i've ever seen and I mean that literally
which is why I've been standing here for
the last 15 minutes but I figured while
I'm here I would give you guys a quick
little lighting demo of these new RGB
fans they're pretty cool actually so
we've got a little controller on the
side here but you can buy one of these
fans with the controller and a 6 fan hub
included or you can just buy the fans by
themselves and I believe you could also
probably buy just the controller and fan
together if you wanted to as well so
let's just do a quick run-through right
now we're on the kind of demo mode
there's a demo effect with this fan so
you can see right now it's kind of going
in circles and it's swapping colors
cycling through the I think it's 7 I
can't remember at 7 or 12 colors that
it's got its got a lot well we'll go
through them you've also got an option
to change the color so I'm going to go
ahead and figure out exactly how many
colors with ring features so we've got
white that's 1 red to kind of an
orangish color that's 3 yellow is for
green 5 blue 6 is that pink or purple
Joe
joe says violet violet that's 7 and then
we're back to a demo mode so you've got
7 colors I was right more or less 7
different colors to choose from and then
you've also got a different six
different modes to choose from as well
so this is kind of just a flashing
between cycling between various colors
you've also got this one which is kind
of a nice fade cycles through those and
you also get this one which is again
sort of a nice fade color and you've got
three speed adjustments so right now
it's going sort of slow you can actually
crank that up or I think that's even
slower there we go I could I know I'm
gonna find a seizure inducing mode on
here eventually we've got this one I
think this is just a static no this is
this is doing something else
it's a switching between them and then
we've also got kind of a pulsating
effect which is pretty cool I'm gonna
swap the color on that as well
and then we've got this one that's there
we go there's our seizure so stay tuned
for these bad boys they're coming in
later this year in August I believe not
sure on pricing but they seem pretty
promising now they've also got the SP
120 RGB fans you only get four modes but
you still get a nice a lot of nice
colors to choose from and
even more importantly this is their
high-end series of fans so they've got
their their ml 120 pros and their ml 140
pros they're now featuring a magnetic
levitation technology bearing so what
that essentially allows it to do is ramp
up to higher rpms but basically feature
the same decibel level so you're getting
faster RPMs more cooling but you're not
really sacrificing too much in terms of
acoustics or load noise things like that
also they are pwm so you want to plug
them into a pwm header on your on your
motherboard you can do that as well they
can go all the way down to about 400 rpm
without shutting off depending on the
controller that you've got they're not
RGB however you do have the option to
get them in white blue or red LEDs and
before in the last generation of fans
you had the little color ring right that
you can swap out well of course there
was like screw that we're we're new and
we're innovating in stuff so instead of
the color ring they're just letting you
swap out these little corners the
mounting corners of the fans to whatever
color you choose so that's pretty cool
LED ring on the center and you've also
got rubber padding on the on each of the
corners to minimize vibration noise and
that sort of thing however if you're
like some people like me some of the
time and you don't like LEDs then you
can opt for the non LED versions and
these are gonna be coming a lot sooner
than the RGB fans we just looked at
these are actually launching sometime in
July so stay tuned for those as well all
right check out this new RAM from the
Corsair this is their vengeance LED
Series performance DRAM ddr4 of course
sports XMP 2.0 and it's gonna be
featured in two different flavors you've
got the red LED at the top or you've got
the white LED at the bottom it's also
going to be coming with a controller
where you can configure the LED
brightness the pulsing rate the the
modes the different effects per stick so
you could actually have a quite a unique
setup in your system it goes all the way
up to 40 400 megahertz speed so this is
really fast Ram and on the Left over
here we've got the premium Dominator
platinum special edition ddr4 and this
is going to be super special edition
they're only producing 500 kits per per
version here so that's kind of like the
black anodized top version at the top
and you've got kind of a more like
silver kind of a softer version at the
bottom so all really good stuff I'm
looking forward to checking one of these
out if I can get my hands on one of
these 500 kits that would
be pretty epic by the way guys by
