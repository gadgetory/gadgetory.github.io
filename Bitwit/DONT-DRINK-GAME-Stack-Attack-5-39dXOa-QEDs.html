I see oh I love it I mean it's pretty
much perfect I just wish it was a little
smaller that was easy
so here ask for my spicy mini oh wow you
did something useful for once nice spell
check it next time too seriously Heather
what kind of request was that you're
gonna ruin it for everyone the customer
is always right
ladies ladies there's no need to fight
Oh let your voice be heard by visiting
the fractal design contact page and
making a product suggestion within
reason
while you're at it you can also check
out the new mesh if I see Minnie click
on the link below to learn more
what's going on guys welcome back to
another episode of stack attack the
ultimate 1v1 gaming showdown where
virtual combat meets real-life
challenges I'm joined once again and
will be going head-to-head with the one
and only beautiful white sauce I would
say that you're beautiful but ugly
orange oh this makes me extra beautifies
couldn't tell we are doing a st. Patty's
Day edition I didn't practice my Irish
accent that's that sucks but we are
gonna be going head-to-head in a round
of csgo arms race it's gonna be super
fun and in case you're new here or just
need a refresher here's a quick look at
the rules of the game the rules of stack
attack are simple before the match
begins four attack cards are dealt
randomly to each player players can play
their attacks on each other at almost
any time during the match but only one
attack per player can be in effect at a
time all attack cards are single-use
only the effects of some attacks are
time-based
while others expire once a challenge has
been complete
once per match a player can summon a
stack attack by playing two cards at
once to deal a devastating combo once
the player in the lead is one kill or
point away from winning
they'll have to surrender all their
unused attack cards to the other player
those are the rules
made the best player win so here are our
eight attack cards for today the first
of which being wasted basically whoever
plays this attack is gonna be able to
spawn a Chris turret on their opponent
we'll find out what that is momentarily
the next one is lit a F which basically
is going to be a strobe light in your
face while you're gaming for three
minutes disclaimer if you have seizures
or your epileptic this is your warning
next up we have sideways where the
victim has to play in portrait mode
while wearing a neck brace the next one
is second wind where the player will
have to wear a festive green beard while
having a fan blow in their face the
remaining four cards we have on the
table here actually involve drinking
because this is a Saint Patty's Day
edition after all so the first of which
we have is iced and when this card is
played the victim has to stop what
they're doing and put one knee on the
table while chugging a smear enough ice
before they can resume next we have
drunk vision where the player has to
take a shot of vodka and then we're
drunken goggles wall gaming I'm not sure
which of those sounds worst and the poor
soul whose hit with a handicap attack
will have to use only a knife until they
chug all the beer out of their fantastic
beer helmet finally we had kill shot
this is a beer pong challenge so every
time your attacker kills you in the game
they have three chances to sink their
ball into one of the cups and then you
have to drink every time they stake a
ball that sounds terrible you thought
about you did oh yeah I think on that
note we're ready to be off the cards yes
we are we can do it let's do it let's
rock paper scissors to see who draws
go on do it get your stupid card face up
oh my turn boom I get sideways all right
now we're gonna draw the drinking cards
that feel I have to drink of course it's
my turn oh I'm nervous you're actually
good at beer pong
oh then I know which one awesome all
right so those are our cards folks I
think we're ready to play get over there
get your butt over there
oh all right here we go moments away
from beginning the match one thing I
forgot to mention two things I forgot to
mention one I'll be using this crappy
child's mouse which sucks for me just as
a little handicap to help wifey sauce
out and to the loser of today's match
we'll have to do something terrible at
the end of today's video so stick around
for that are you ready honey hey you've
got we've each got the same number of
cards so it's anyone's game let's do it
three two one go I'm trying not just
show it on my face but I'm pretty happy
with my cards and I think she's in
properly my cards I can hear you your
dainty little footsteps boss see you oh
nice shot Wow
got some nice ain't there Wow okay
you been practicing no where you at girl
oh shit that actually kind of scared me
no didn't don't even know where you are
good you scared now I don't know where
you are
oh you're walking aren't you drunk
vision watch you take it it's only the
world's finest she did it girls
oh it's gonna be disgusting oh no put
those goggles on I've never tried these
goggles on personally but I have a
feeling they're gonna suck oh my god oh
fuck you oh my god
oh are you serious there's no way
there's no way I mean I might as well
just forfeit now how is this possible I
mean I don't think I've ever been this
drunk in real life where my vision this
cannot be happening to me right now
iced iced oh my god okay I'm just gonna
get this card out of the way when I
first met Kyle he was a big party boy so
he's gonna chug his way through this are
we really doing this right now we're
really doing this I got a I hope I don't
break the desk
I don't even know so cold it's so cold
honestly but I can't why don't you do
that to me why oh we're stand apart my
worst enemies I was terrible I really
like I literally can't see like like I
know you're there fucking see you I will
knife you at some point
oh my god yes oh my god oh my god really
right now wait no it's really blows huh
do you take your glasses on do I have to
yeah because that you're silly your eyes
oh my god fine but then I can't see the
screen - dad what's up fair
too bad too bad you're blind no yeah no
yeah no I disagree my eyes are getting
dried out enough as it is that's too bad
really yes honey
all right fine just know that I cannot
see anything and now ever I have the
right to camp
oh yeah yeah see you're fine got killed
by a a blind bearded man oh oh and I
just killed the blind paired my eyes are
so dry what oh yeah strobe light strobe
it's true I honestly have no idea how
this one's gonna affect her so that's
why I'm playing early on the game let's
see how it goes
shit yeah my god you scared me so bad
good oh don't get close to me yeah
that's what you get sure oh yeah I
thought the light was gonna be
distracting but it didn't really bother
me oh shit oh my gosh how's it so
stressed out oh wait shit yes oh I got
spawn killed by the person who spawned
all the kudos to you kudos good Oh
oh shit
handicap oh no way are you sure this is
a punishment I think this is a reward
for Kyle I've been known to chug my way
out of almost any situation
oh shit you have to killed me I honestly
thought this was gonna be easy but since
you're sucking it through a straw it
bombs up as soon as it goes into your
mouth so I'm having a really hard time
swallowing this stuff and it's a lot
more difficult than I thought I feel
like the drinking carts have stolen a
lot of attention this episode but this
card is gonna do some serious damage
[Laughter]
kill it
I think I'm gonna throw up yes Oh Oh No
yes yes
come on oh my god really mean like you
trying to fucking play like this it's
fucking impossible God we've done
something similar to this in a previous
episode but this time the gun is much
stronger and there's a lot more
ammunition god help me oh my god really
but you know for being a nerf gun oh
that's what hurts
I'm feeling very defeated and salty
right now but at least I get to watch
guy on pain alright oh my god ok I got
the knife yeah I got the knife I got the
knife and I have to hand over all unused
attacks to the opponents so you can use
that I can't believe I forgot to use
kill shot before I got the golden knife
I'm so upset with myself right now
come here come it pitch really really
shoot me in the face
shoot me the face right now do it do it
now oh my god you're catching up so much
seriously Oh tell me I can smell the
victory I can smell it oh shit I'm out
of ammo knife against knife I suppose
got shot I should be happy that I stole
his last card but I'm so far behind that
I'm already checked out except my knife
is goaded in oh you just alright alright
so I'm gonna pause really quick while
you take your three attempts
Oh oh shit you have a gun
oh fuck I do I had a gun ha ha you had a
nice no I mean I do have a knife too but

punishment kyle is in there right now

embarassingly buy them at the grocery
