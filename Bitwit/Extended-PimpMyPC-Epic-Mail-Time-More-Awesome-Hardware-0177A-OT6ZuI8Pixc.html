potentially have them make exercised or
whatever by the way he's an undead
shaman he's high he's we're on YouTube
now okay okay networks treatment of both
now it's serious now now I really have
to watch what I say I'm gonna get
serious but since we're live to both I
guess we'll start the show
so welcome this is awesome hardware 177
I'm served 177 side a did I look it off
Paul and I have done a little bit of
pre-gaming already but this is a tech
news live show that Paul and I do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware and we also stream the show to
our respective YouTube channels this
week the first half is on my channel and
in about half an hour or so we'll switch
over to Paul's channel you can find a
link to that in description or you can
go to youtube.com slash Paul's hardware
and the stream will will be there for
some for side beat when we're ready for
that but depart from that do we like to
have an occasional beverage or five on
the show it's all it's all in good fun
if you would like to drink with us feel
free to do so as long as you're doing it
responsibly um and also we occasionally
swear on the show we use adult language
so if that's a sort of thing you're not
into and be warped if there's little
ones around something like that
apart from that though we do have an
announcement it's actually a positive
announcement in regards to the charity
of the charity that that Steve and
gamers Nexus have set up it's called the
Eden reforestation no reforestation I
always mess at least word reforestation
reforestation okay so he's forestation
reforestation projects which is actually
a great cause it's hard to find a good
in projects dot org by the way there you
go he actually set this up in his
something hashtag something positive
campaign sort of in in response in some
ways to to the verge and to their their
editor-in-chief reckless who who who
dared him to do something positive for
the world almost as an insult and sure
enough if he's at the game Nexus Twitter
he's been retweeting everyone who has
been donating so it's awesome
basically
the the editor-in-chief of the verge
told Steve to do something positive
Steve responded by doing one thousand
dollar donation to eat in projects and
saying hey guys if if you're done with
doing something positive to maybe do a
donation to there or to a chair it to a
worthy reputable charity of your choice
and go ahead and tweet to them so
they're a bunch of a bunch of people
have been doing donations yeah it's it's
just trying to do something positive so
if you guys want to join in feel please
feel free to do so I'm trying to get
down to Steve's original tweet and
donation a there's so many to scroll
past it's a really good cause it's a
your your money is going towards
planting trees but it's third world
countries and very impoverished
communities that are being hired
employed given jobs to plant these trees
and also helps with climate change while
also giving people jobs that really
really need money yeah really really
need money like they need chairs and
shit you know they need socks I also
like that they're employing people
they're not just exactly here's my
exactly yeah let's put it put him to
work you know that's what I always say
so anyway well you found the tweet yeah
oh yeah this is the original tweet that
Steve that Steve sent out and and his
original donation that he made which was
a $1000 donation plus his donation of
the amount that he made from his video
tweeting about the right situation with
the version everything which happened
over the past week where they issued a
copyright strike against Kyle
fortunately that's been lifted yep and
because we're live-streaming because we
wouldn't be able to do this that's right
we're still there that's so true it says
holy crap it's worth pointing out yeah
okay so are we gonna plug those stories
let's do this alright quick just for
today my store is big with dr. bit we
detect if you want to buy some cool
merch from my store it helps me with
with the things I do after you site in
case I think it yeah after you've
donated to give you know we want money
to you know in case they get copyright
strike again by looking for my sister
quick and then Paul store is Paul's
Harbor net you should also buy something
from his store if you can to buy
something for me you gotta buy something
from Paul like it so don't be a dick
like we're like your children and you're
gonna have favor just get off some
hardware merchant it's awesome Harbor
both equally so we'll we'll yell Johnson
that you if you don't know what that is
you will find out at the end of the show
and let's move on to our first segment
which is I found this on Gawker
congress.com
it's a it's kind of interesting it's
about a grown up website editor is it
titled a grown up website editor throws
Twitter tantrum over his bracelet the
person they're talking about is nil a I
believe it's Neal a Neal a meal a Patel
wait a second
isn't me like Nilay Patel that's the
editor-in-chief of The Verge here's what
you mean he runs the Virge largest and
successful tech website what wait hold
on hold on how does that wait and what's
the date on this article Jim are digging
back to 25th 2015 oh my god I'm so sorry
I somehow brought this old article up I
must have got confused I wasn't really
looking at the dates but hey since I
spent all the time digging here actually
Steve did pass in the book happened to
share this with me the other night I
found it hilarious also forced us to
talk about it and I figured what idea
yeah I I thought this was too good to
not share so this is an article from
2015
I'm sure Mila is a completely changed
man since then but he apparently wrote a
very critical review of the unpair
phrasing here a 7,000 word review of the
Apple watch from which he also shaved
his forearm for the video portion that's
commitment right there you'd think he'd
be a pretty secure man but last night in
2015 he became publicly upset because
other adults were laughing at his
jewelry so apparently he said something
like I felt ridiculous wearing this this
loop this is Melanie's loop really just
quoting this article by the way none of
these are our own words they're from the
article yes so I didn't and then they
point out that on his other wrist
he's wearing a spiky bracelet perhaps
probably purchased from Hot Topic
I've seen those for sale at Hot Topic I
definitely have I used to have one when
I was 13 they look very badass they are
I mean look at the fear in his eyes just
are just like the you mean the fire the
fire in his eyes obvious fear of people
of
as of people who would see someone
wearing a bracelet like that he's his
own reflection
so if it just kind of got the article
just points out a bunch of tweets after
someone wrote about his contradicting
nature and just just how kind of absurd
it was that he was commenting on on the
ridiculousness of the Apple watch when
in fact he was wearing this teen angsty
bracelet it's the irony just I mean
there's lots our knees following him
it's not just teenagers throughout the
years there's lots of banks ridden
people he's just a very angry person I
don't know want to wear spiky things but
he decided to lash out and and really
dig his grave deeper as he still does
now it seems so I guess maybe he has
allegedly allegedly so these are tweets
from his Twitter handle at reckless
where he's he's firing back firing back
very poorly I might add at the people
who are are kind of laughing at this
whole his his article he said I don't
wear jewelry I wear spiky bracelets
first of all that doesn't sound better
choosing to not understand personal
style is well-chosen ignorance it's such
an air of just
pretentious I don't know
it's allegedly I'm not making an
argument the alleged this is all
allegedly which this should be a rumors
a rumor mill segment right here and not
making an argument he calls out this
person on Twitter I'm just calling you
an old man jackass
old white men critiquing my spiky
bracelet is just my favorite did it ever
occur to anyone that I wear this thing
as a studied reminder that I do not want
to ever fit in or be a fucking suit you
know I said as a corporate the corporate
reminds me I used to have a fucking suit
did you yeah fit like a glove you know
just so you can feel everything and I
just I don't remember what happened to
it that's just someone's gonna find it
someday and
anyway so what were you talking about I
do you lost me I get so enveloped in
your story okay um but so anyway I
thought I thought this was this was
relevant current news relevant current
news like that was worth this is as
reported by the Gawker which has been
shut down for quite some time yes it's
been shut down but the other Gawker
Media was involved in that whole thing
where they got sued because they did the
thing with Hulk Hogan very relevant cool
cool
all right well um what beautiful
beautiful article there thank you Steve
for the for the referral and that is all
for news all for tech news even only
news article I have on my half
I think it's news enough it's good let's
move on to the extended segment of pimp
my rig which I promised you guys on
Twitter earlier today it's been my PC
sorry
pimp my PC in my rig is a different
series on my channel a week off so yes
it's been weird it's been weird you know
you don't realize like I've basically
quit YouTube I could have easily had the
strike for a week and wouldn't have
noticed it because I've just been busy
moving and stuff but I feel I feel like
lost
I almost feel lost like I don't know who
I am anymore like like this this is that
hasn't been shaved I haven't like posted
a video in nearly a week I haven't shot
anything in nearly a week like who am i
you know it's weird
well it's important as I'm John on this
journey of rediscovery you know you're
looking at a clean slate and that's the
beauty of it I am you know you can you
can reimagine yourself it's as if you
were like you know a junior high student
suddenly moved to a new town and you
know none of your old friends are there
anymore and you can recreate yourself
I'm a cool sell everyone that your
actual history was completely different
and you're raised you know by ninjas
somewhere or something like that so
that's what I think you should be
focusing on right now I am is
next the backstory because that's how
you build a character you know and
that's how you get see people need to be
invested and I think when we changed my
channel name man oh really you've just
inspired me
well what to change it for a fifth time
what are you gonna change it to I don't
know I'll probably just you know write
some names put them in a hat pick one
you know okay give it some long hard
thought I'm sure check could come up
with some good I'm sure they will Lyle's
channel it's what they say perfect
all right so let's let's move on to pit
my rig no can my pc we got the new lower
thirds and everything whoo you bet
that'll be fancy that we finally settled
that lawsuit with Matt Philly just
kidding all right the promises promises
is the first victim for he begs lots of
cool systems he does and this one's
interesting this is an interesting
system
look at this artistic ketchup and
mustard cabling it looks that it almost
feels wrong to critique it I'm still
gonna critique it cuz it's ketchup and
mustard
but it's so well taken care of it's it's
like multi-coloured spaghetti it's I
don't know great it makes you want a hot
dog or something it's also I feel like
it's a it's a very sharp and crisp and
well lit picture on an all white
background that's right I think I think
that's probably also playing into a
little bit just that just give it an
adventure such an interesting choice
there okay
I wonder if he had no room on the other
side oh yeah it looks pretty tight
there's a little bit
look at that cable management though
that's really sure it's an antic girth
watts 750 watt 80 plus bronze with your
power spot which is like a really solid
good power supply right antic antic has
always done a good job with their power
supplies although they haven't done a
good job with the aesthetics I feel like
that's what yeah we're we're EVGA kinda
came in and started combining right I
saw the power supplies with what else is
it having the black cables and some of
those other features features people who
are looking for but for what given here
it's pretty pretty damn good that's to
put together
was less than $50 okay so maybe he's a
gtx 960 in there how is it less than 50
maybe he already had some parts lying
around here he put other words in here
here's my submission its
cobble to frozen slate d square and 83 d
squares 83 and i recently threw together
cost to put together with sub $50 only
actually had to buy the motherboard okay
so people were throwing in parts so this
is maybe a pay it forward build perhaps
I'm guessing profits just this is that's
what I'm trimming in which case well
done I hope it goes to a good cause
and I mean well then that's a that's a
that's a clean looking system I'd be
happy to have that yeah I mean
especially considering that you're
working with a not very aesthetically
pleasing power supply yeah but
definitely you should spend another
hundred dollars on this $50 build on
some sleeved extensions that's what you
should do or just get a new partner like
I don't know where you would hide all
that yeah that's a lot that's a lot of
stuff and very little but there's
actually hard drives in the bottom it
looks like so there's nowhere else to
put the cables yeah and I think this was
one of those like this is an old case
yeah they weren't really you know and
have a power supply basement we could
just shove everything into the nether
regions never to be seen from again but
we've all been there before
great job prophecies thank you probably
you're a clean builder do you have a
bottle opener by the way I do I knew
there's something misspelled opener has
the pawls hardware thumb screw logo on
it it's available on my storage called
harbour definite definitely buy five of
these at least thank you sir uh next up
liev's Mike 8700 K 32 gigs of ram you
can see the rest Oh Riley's face well
then well we sure can thank you for
observing that we have eyes this is a
very clean looking system look at that
it looks like you just built it there's
like not a speck of dust on there from
the pictures is that a it's really clean
wait it sent GTX you said what do you
say what case is that
that's it it's an NXT yeah liquid cooler
but it's not like one of their H 500
that's an elite Trier great could be an
elite
for glass that's not late uh it's in
NZXT yeah okay there s340 only forty
elite okay I'm thinking that's when him
but where's did he take the bar out I
don't see the bar where is there a
better picture where we don't have a
side we don't know just rishis NZXT I
feel like that's their signature look at
the cable management it could just be
the angle maybe he removed it yeah I
mean yeah you can take it off something
yeah he removed it and it's very
possible slept it up so all right but
anyway that's what confused me at first
all right moving on let's clean what is
that thing on the right on top of his
power supply shroud this on top of it up
here yeah that controller might be an
LED controller okay it looks like he's
got a little what you're eventually
highlighted was a LCD couple LED strips
back here now right in the background
illumination Mike I wish you would have
given us a straight-on shot I feel like
there's stuff we're missing here yeah
cuz cuz cuz I almost wouldn't have
pictures had I noticed that these LEDs
right here I feel like you must have put
there to do something and I'd like to
get a better look at the moment right
what's going on by the radiator but yeah
I mean other than that looks like a
clean build NZXT you know solid job with
their cases I like it I see him up there
of the of the software LCD display right
there that was pretty good man
and we but yeah we need oh there it is
all right one more time I thought there
was my bad okay my bad alright so the
bars they're shredded bite it okay it's
one of the older ones - yes that doesn't
come out right that doesn't mean it's
older well the s340 elites is is older
than like the H 500 I and stuff like
that
yeah H 400 is all the h1 all of the
newer h1 I think had the further out bar
yeah the bar that goes all the way
through that goes over that weird
intelligent hub okay but uh I don't I
don't know why I picked this one there's
not much to critique here yeah not
really
oh man it's real good get get some get
some air fans get some air RGB fans up
in there you know I don't know B I like
the a RGB because they're not super
gaudy there's a kind of a light LED ring
around the fans that you know would go
really nicely with the blue that you've
already got in here and it syncs up what
you've already you're already running
cam might as well it syncs with all your
other NZXT device anything you add on
here to this system better better work
with camphor mmhmm mm-hmm
he's abuse yeah it's really good though
nice clean bill
I would I would steal it easily steal X
is Michael Michael oh good girl still
checking along and FX 6100 so this is
this is an older system 4.3 gigahertz
though so a bit of an overclock on that
I believe I don't remember what to stock
frequency is on the FX 60 199 T FX ultra
durable three from gigabyte g.skill
ripjaws x8 gig kit eight gigs of ram
gigabyte 149 64 gig and of course
there's 730 T case it's a big case
alright it's a big case some big bowls
lots of there's lots of room in there
lots of room for activities oh yeah move
rat you do a backflip in there power
supply fan is facing up which is not
like a horrible thing but I do believe
this case is new enough that it does
have a dust filter at the bottom
underneath that so you know that might
be something worth worth considering
doing but you know it's probably not a
huge deal honestly get your mustard yeah
you've got a you've got a ketchup and
mustard situation
honestly standing out here way more than
anything else but you know you're
looking at a pretty budget rig so you
could maybe get like a you know you can
get a 24-pin extension I feel like for
10 or 15 bucks maybe if you if you look
around you can get a kit with like even
like the graphics card and your 8 pin
EPS for like 30 bucks well at this point
he's saving for a new rise in build yeah
like right this is this is a this is a
good little system but but I'm just
saying like start if he's keeping that
power supply or even any power supply
and he's keeping the theme the color
theme or something
like that like the case is still awesome
yeah that's a good case keep the case
and if you already have those red LED
fans and you probably want to upgrade
those ketchup and mustard cables anyway
just drop like 20 30 bucks on some
extensions of course like Paul said
items I was raised him like if you
wanted I would like in my opinion if you
want to do a short-term quick update to
just get rid of that one thing that does
stand out more than anything else I just
I wouldn't I wouldn't want to spend more
than 10 or 15 bucks maybe 20 cheap
bastard beyond that save for a core
system update because you've got a lot
of other perfectly adequate hardware or
submit you got a decent case it looks
like you've got you know an adequate
power supply even your graphics card
could hold out for a little bit longer
you want a core system update because
your FX 6100 you know like you'd like
you said it's your old drill probably
probably you've got a lot of use out of
it
but that's what you're looking for next
but your old grandma other than that
though I mean for what you got in here
it's it's like I said plenty of open
space lots of room so good work with
jail management I think you did a good
job with what you're working with we
didn't even look at the other pictures
really oh we didn't because that was
already a good picture there it is all
closed see that yeah looks like a Sith
Lords computer this and but yeah you can
easily carry that case over for another
build update so the next I don't like
your name Rubin it makes me hungry
here's 2260 an RT X 2060 build I just
did with a 6800 k EVGA X 99 micro 2
motherboard 16 gigs of DDR for 256 gig
9950 pro and some other stuff fractal
measure if I see mini tempered-glass
great case choice love it ok love it and
you've just got a founders position or
TX 2060 in there which the Fed the Betty
cards can't knock them for this
generation they look pretty good the
look the aesthetic is really grown on me
you couldn't ask for when they cost a
hundred bucks extra of course but the
2060 doesn't right it's it's also 350 I
don't know you're probably right I
believe that's the case you're probably
right because I have no idea but yeah I
mean
think I think it looks really nice
especially in this build where you have
those great Corsair fans but with the
great blades and the H the the water
block there everything is matching
really nicely
I like the micro ATX form factor this is
a great case in my opinion it's
interesting how you have the rear fan as
intake as opposed to exhaust I don't see
like a third party dust filter that
you've thrown on there so that might
introduce a bit more dust into the
equation if you're ok with that
you okay with may be cleaning it more
regularly than that's fine but if not if
it's getting a little too dusty too
quickly I would flip that fan around
drop some work heat away from from your
vrm area especially because it doesn't
look like you have full heat sinks in
that in that arena but apart from that
you know you've got black cables that
are stocked with the power supply
they're not sexy I would say they're
black and they blend in which is good
but if you wanted to take it to the next
level of course that's something you
could look into like extensions and
whatnot oh that the face scared me what
face exit out that face on the right
that yeah I just saw a face face I like
it there's a wider shot
what's that below the card is that a is
it a Wi-Fi card zoom in enhance Intel
it's too tiny my eyes are not good not
good nice um maybe audio wait what is it
that what is that like as people Wi-Fi
oh yeah it's a fan v FS I 102 Wi-Fi card
thank you very much Jeremy the minor
gotta love check um cool well there's
really not much else to critique here it
looks really good to me cables and maybe
flip the fan and you're good to go I
agree maybe give it a testing give it
some love a light dusting right after a
tasty Reuben sandwich
all right moving on to Brandon B or is
it be random
Abraham Brandon could be be rainin
alright be random so we have here any it
he didn't really give specs he just asks
any suggestions okay so he has a
crosshair six hero motherboard yes we
can we can infer quite a bit here it
looks like maybe rx 580 or our X 480
reference that's a Vega is it Vega
that's probably a Vega 56 or maybe 64 it
looks like it has dual eight pin count
so maybe that's my B oh just the
reference 56 have dual Athens yeah I
think it's 56 this is the 56 yeah I have
that exact card it's this one so it's
nice to see an alien card an AMD there
card in here we don't see those too
often on on this segment but there they
are in the flesh there it is in the
flesh also explains the black and red
theme very pro AMD here and you've got
an AMD CPU as well oh let's see
critiques critiques
mmm I mean the cables look pretty good I
guess if you're you're beaming
if you're being picky you know you could
comb up the back part of these a little
bit but it's really just that angle you
took that picture at bro oh yeah makes
it stand out more than anything else I
don't know this this USB 3 connector
here I I appreciate that it's it's an
it's a premium connector yeah also draws
a lot of attention to that plug B it
could be tightened up yeah just tuck it
away a little more so that less is
exposed yeah also your top fans are
mounted as intakes which is kind of
interesting yeah that is that is
somewhat interesting yeah that means you
have five intakes and one
exhaust I'd like to see a bit more
neutral pressure in here and also just I
don't want your system to get super
dusty even though the dust filter at the
front of your case there's probably not
one at the top and I was gonna say I
wonder what it looks like when it's lit
up it looks like he has all of his RGB
stuff set to white which which is fairly
which looks nice with the red yeah
because he's also got the team oh yeah
the RGB yeah SSD down there all right if
you're gonna do one thing in here maybe
take your WD I can take the label and
somehow reprint the label but make it
red instead of blue where does it work
that'd be sweet it's a good idea like
that I don't know how you do that but
that'd be cool I'm sure it's different
though and I like the all AMD thing -
yeah Oh Andy is techie sterling with a
with no text just a picture just picture
we have a Corsair all-in-one liquid
cooler it looks like an Intel platform
they're hard to say it's a Z 390
tomahawk mag knows the mags III 90s so
this is probably a newer build Wow
you know we'd have to speculate on what
the yeah it CPU is under that the newer
glad just wondering we get really really
really really big hydro Pro Series ok
yeah we just have a situation where it
looks like you just kind of plugged
everything in and didn't pay any
attention to cable management which
means you should completely redo all
that you know where everything plugs in
now so go around your there and reroute
some stuff you have a great new
management case yeah
there's no excuse there's lots of extra
room in here your liquid cooler is
positioned in such a way that it looks
like you've got pretty droopy you know
on your tubing here and maybe even have
some contact with the graphics card you
could potentially just flip the radiator
up here so the tubes are coming out on
the right you know they kind of swoop
across here from the right side and that
might keep them up and off of that yeah
that's a little bit of a faux pas as
well true
yeah then that's just just really in
need of a rewiring what memory is that
the memory standing out is red it is
team group memory it's so red it's very
red
like what material is that it almost
looks like he just ms painted red four
red squares or rectangles over it's not
the prettiest but I wouldn't say it's
the most horrible either so but it
stands out because there's nothing else
red but I don't know your graphics card
is looking a little underpowered to me
but I don't know what your CPU is if you
got a z3 90 motherboard then that's a
more expensive motherboard so I hope you
have a pretty decent CPU with that and
not some super low-end one otherwise you
paid too much for your motherboard in
which case you should upgrade your your
graphics card because that looks like a
budget GPU yeah that's a good 10 50 TI
or something yeah yeah single fan cool
something like that all right well you
know you got some things to work on
there sterling but I think you got
potential at least so good next up we
see a CEO we've got three more
CEO since I desperately need to clean it
anyways yay negative pressure here's my
dinosaur probably meaning it sold also
added road hog since it's a pigsty in
there go propria core i7 960 dinosaur
gtx 760 I'm gonna stop now now I just
feel bad in that coating Lyle beautiful
um Wow okay you know it looks cozy in
here
it looks like a very cozy system like
everything's in it well just to follow
up he got a new PC 11 dynamic le on the
liliani case he will be upgrading from
this this is a 2011 build ok this is
actually a good thing so hopefully
you're also upgrading the core platform
because I feel like there's room for
improvement in the performance arena not
just the case
yeah so it makes it kind of hard to
suggest certain things the power supply
still great power supply thousand watts
keep that but maybe get some extensions
for it so it looks a little nicer in the
new in the new case and the AI Oh
depending on the CPU you go with I think
that Hale is still gonna be banging just
give it a good cleaning you know it's
gonna rival a lot of premium air coolers
and our GTX yeah GTX 760 I would say it
might be time for an upgrade this is an
ex 58 board it's got triple channel
memory yeah mmhmm yeah that's that's a
great case that you picked out too so
it's uh yeah I think I think make those
few changes until we know more
information maybe submit your PC again
for a future episode went when it's in
the new dynamic it's gonna say about the
power supply this is a cooler master
power supply it's probably it probably
is just fine you might be able to get
something more efficient if you updated
it just just a thought if you're
considering spending you know anything
more than fifty or seventy dollars
unlike cable extensions for this one
maybe consider just getting a new one
because although a maybe there's a B+
well it's a 2011 build it's it's not
eighty plus rated as the main reason
that I'm saying that it also seems to be
from the older age when like wattage was
like everyone just like more wattage
because that makes a better power supply
if it's got more why why did she isn't
marketing line of them the efficiency
stock it's still a cooler master unit
I'd want to look that up and
double-check and see like it's it's
probably just anyway the RS a zero zero
ESP a RS a zero zero a MBA - j-3 is what
it is okay this doesn't look like it's a
t plus so that one's probably not either
it might have just predated when that
became you know a widely widely used
yeah standard
thank you though okay all right let's uh
move on to just got a say with a i v
7600 k builds recent XFX
rx 488 gig Ripjaws 2x4 a 2 by 4 gig or 8
gig total ddr4 kit samsung 970 Evo 500
gig SSD 650 watt Brown's reddit EVGA
power supply hyper 212 Evo Z 270
motherboard alright I would I would say
your eyes are so small I don't know
there's just control scroll just I feel
like the picture should be bigger right
like I looked at I did open in new tab
minutes that's like that's how big it is
you could control oh yeah there you go
like that but it's still some small
alright
here again we have a cable management
situation that could use a lot of
tidying up yeah
actually down by the para spot looks
fine there's just too many that are
exposed back behind here if there's more
tuck edge behind the motherboard traje
that could be done make sure it's also
gonna say it seems like your I don't
know the builds a little lopsided we got
a 7600 K which is pretty solid CPU but
we have a slightly outdated GPU I mean
there are X 480 still fine it's still
fine if you're doing 1080 gaming yeah
but I agree like the 7600 K especially
if you're overclocking could handle a
lot more than a 480 yeah I guess
definitely yeah beyond that I just just
redo cable management's and then we have
the hyper 212 standard edition which
always turn about cuz like it's a good
cooler but yeah the black it is so nice
but so much nicer look cleaner in there
for like 10 bucks more whatever take the
power supply sticker off yeah I'm
alright I'm regretting what I said about
the are X 480 it's still just fine never
mind about be there so privileged you're
such a privileged gamer Paul gosh
yeah I'm still so I'm offended spoiled
behind graphics cards
when your board unit okay we got one
more of those Stefan's see here with a
rise in five 2600 build a sister I'm Pro
X 470 motherboard trident z8 gig kit at
16 gig kit 3200 speed duty x 1050 TI WD
blue hard drive
I already gig IDI blue m dot 2 or of the
WD blue end bat - fractal design to find
C Coursera ll 120 fans alright hmm
alright hmm so this is a nice a nice
build but it feels transitional to me
like it like you've got you've got
you've got your temporary parts and
you've got your long-term parts right
yeah the long-term parts are gonna be
your case you're how are your
motherboard and your motherboard and
your processor are very solid for right
now your memory setup is very good for
right now yeah and I really do like that
you've got that tried NCR gb memory with
the rising kit in the 3300 speed that's
it's a good combo and and that kit just
works with Rison yeah which is nice
Joseph you also a very good airflow on
your case and a very good cable
management just the graphics are really
yeah you've your graphics card could use
a bump and the cooler perhaps and your
CPU heatsink fan yeah could also use a
bump I will say especially with their
eyes and 520 600 that is a wraith
stealth not a wraith spire correct so
you could probably get a little bit more
performance a little bit a little more
top ends single core performance out of
your 2600 with a with a cooler upgrade
so that would be that i Wow what do you
do first your GPU would make the biggest
impact in gaming yeah GPU would have the
biggest impact CPU heatsink fan I mean
you could get a 40 50 dollar air cooler
that would be a nice bump up from there
you know look nicer and potentially get
you a little bit more performance so you
know when you're when your birthday
comes up or whatever
next you know and you have the relative
who might spend 200 or 300 bucks if you
if you're lucky enough to have that
person there they're gonna buy you the
GPU right and then figure out how you're
gonna get a a new cooler for you CPU
other than that though we're like really
well really well done with the overall
builds yeah definitely
cable management we tightened up in a
couple places
down at the bottom but you know but
nothing maybe maybe just a bit nothing
too dramatic here yeah and uh yeah nice
nice part selection overall there might
be away with the defined C to take your
fan cables and direct them there's and
push them back through so you don't have
to have them going across here it's got
cut outs over yeah so maybe maybe think
about rewriting those there that's all
nice buildup very nice and that is it
that that's all of them we went through
like knows a lot of data nine or ten
ia's for pin my PC we usually do like
five sometimes six so consider that the
end of our extended pin my PC segment
heads to the yes time first time that we
only have one more now mail time meal
time all right
it's Epic Meal Time where do we get what
do we got I have not been to my pillbox
in months it's my knife it has been
months since I went to my PO box in fact
I got a voicemail two days ago my old
lady's saying you have a package if we
don't pick it up in the next week I'm
I'm just gonna have to send it back no
so I hauled my ass over there and went
to the post office and picked up all
your shit thanks thanks for thanks for
making old ladies blob might might my
inbox well I'm good thanks bro you did
that
thanks Bros very let's see what you guys
sent very thoughtful can I open open
stuffs all right this is from John Jay
Jones from New York Brooklyn Brooklyn
New York
yeah like I like the last name mess it
up alright let's see got a letter here I
like when the letters are handwritten to
feel so personal no oh please do not
receive all parts out on a video okay
maybe I just won't read how does he know
what I'll read first I'll read this my
own personal time mr. Daniel Daniel I
got I'm gonna move it some people get to
see it I got your letter
I'm going to read it thank you for
sending it from from Northern Ireland
this came from Ireland no it smells like
it smells like booze smells so good
Thank You Daniel I'll read this very
soon not on street wanna beer we have
here from John Jay this this is just a
massive what's USB for the hub Wow look
at that
with all those USB port oh my god this
mini USB ports now Kyle you've used up
to my USB game there is an AC adapter
and it comes with a USB 3.0 cable it
looks like okay well you can take the
cables won't be oh there's a B to a and
is your eats if there's a B to a and a B
to C oh cool
I do have a seaport on the back of my
mouth I mean means squeeze look at that
just it gives you charging ports with
2.4 amp nice ok so the red ones blue
that looks pretty well so hilarious they
would send this to you that Taurus I
guess that's the only way that you could
possibly even that tourists like if
they're trying to get free coverage of a
product on your show that's sound
there's the only way that people could
possibly figure out what that is is that
very sturdy or by Joan Joan J from
Brooklyn there's no no no that's all
this is it it's often they
guys I appreciate you sending us stuff
it's video I mean it's yeah you it's
unnecessary appreciated but also
necessary we already have all the stuff
we could ever possibly want tech related
I mean I mean like as a product it's
kind of stupid because it's on this fall
there's ten USB 3.0 ports here well
going through there should be like you
throw a bunch of devices in there and
have them all connecting a USB 3.0
speeds correct there's some use for this
I guess but it's just that's a lot what
about charging how how much arm a device
a device are you charging or if you like
duplicating duplicating USB what what's
the max throughput from your PC 4 amps
could you could you three devices at 2.4
ramps on one USB 3 no you couldn't right
so even even this is silly
no well that's because it's got it's got
a separate AC power oh right plugs
gotcha yeah it can power is fine I'm
you're running out of charge a bunch
just I'm David transfer any little sauce
into something ground behind these huge
alright what I come from I think it's
from Kenny okay thank you very much
Kenny chunming Chow New York I love your
videos a lot it's funny and serious at
the same time I feel like I'm doing the
impossible about two years ago my old HP
Pavilion PC crashed my brother-in-law
got me a new Dell XPS i7 PC last year by
watching YouTube I learned how to
resurrect my old PC by creating a media
creation tool and reinstalling Windows
10 swapping out the 500 gigs to a one
terabyte hard drive and installing an
EVGA geforce 210 passive graphics card I
recently got around building a new PC
using my old case I'm not asking for a
handout but I just wanted your opinion
I should swap out the case or keep it
here's my parts list go into three
stores to get them I did a lot of
walking
I don't do online shopping wow that's
very bold move sir now you can email me
you can walk you
okay or public transit it would appear
poetry it's true go ahead and crack that
guy but let me look over it um not much
just say here as far as where it comes
from it's just shipped to you and it's a
bomb there's the USPS definitely a bomb
careful down there
everyone everyone order six motor oil
from Chattanooga from chat flat magnets
for phone why no it's Jeb Lou everyone's
gonna buy this now that now that I have
shown if something wrong with this item
no need to return please contact us via
Amazon this is a volt port website full
port universal magnetic car mount cell
phone holder why is this so they're
magnetic cell phone cell phone cell
phone holders sorry is it like adhesive
on the back of your stick interior no
Kyle's you're the one how does this work
who's advertising for this I'm not
advertising anything beer is everything
knowing their product open it on your
YouTube channel it would be rude of me
not to these people simple package
something and send it to my dress
there's no longer exist by the way
everyone achieve this year like glue I'm
gonna send Kyle something always got his
peel box in the description don't do it
via box guy I'm not it's no longer there
somebody else and random stranger will
get your letter or package I'm gonna
have a new peel box in the next few
weeks wait for that do not send me
anything I will not ever see it what is
it
well no one's gonna buy it now Paul you
just demonstrated the product doesn't
work that's what because I'm giving it a
review you know should that be a segment
that we do what's happening I don't know
there's just fam hey people spamming
chat stuff it moderators itself spammers
I don't know what case you have
you're mr. Kinney unless you're keeping
your HP pavilion case if that's the case
pun intended I would swap to something
different definitely looks like he's
dealing with like a sub $500 bill then I
would get a sub $60 case I always
recommend fantex for like really cheap
cases like not 50 60 bucks
you
rhyming down for dinner Oh time for
dinner
you dogs say about that yes that is
there's a flipside of using this mic
which we're hearing sounds better this
week but yes okay Kenny good luck on
your build I would go for like a 50 or
$60 case a lot of good options from
fantex or fractal fractal design also
have some good ones Wow usually really
strong the magnet yeah oh so just fight
your your your two second review
completely bashing the products you're
now you're now changing your mind
ballpark mounts endorsed by cut fat cow
bike on from bit wood oh that's not what
that says nope volt port it's not true I
never endorse this product a little
pouch with some metal any any products I
happen to the Box on this segment or
Paul's milk mill time I do not endorse
personally these are just things that
are sent to me this Wow I will endorse
that that magnitude that works very
magnetic but I already have a pretty
decent phone phone mount in my car
alright I'll keep I'll keep these in not
one let me once two of them right yeah
you greedy bastard
sue me for each of us
yeah cuz I'm you me you get one who's
this from
oh wait this is from Marcos Marcos
Marcos my kiss oh please not throw away
I am NOT an advertiser good kid I love
this very simple note like please do not
throw away the long letter I sent you
not like those Volta leeches I am NOT
this is this is not a vole port ad sorry
about printer quality and hand written
know I like handwritten you get you get
massive
in my book compatible with the Paul's
hardware and the bit weight all right
wait did I just throw it no no I don't
know those the pre letter all right what
are you what are you open up the
business that's the whole port you've
got this one's fun I like that I get
keep opening the packages I'm a very
selfless person I'll let you have all
the fun fall that's true Asia horse
oh no they're either cables Asia ports
what you've heard of this right you've
seen me talk about them on my channel no
I aged a horse they're like a Chinese
company that does like cables like
sleeve cables they do fans they do so
it's either RGB fans or its extension
like sleep extensions is your horse I've
actually used them in many bills several
bills because they're like that you
they're super cheating but not terrible
quality and like they're actually pretty
decent for the price I've recommended
them before but I really don't need any
more cables or anything tech related I
really don't need to take these yeah you
should you should ease your horse unless
I really like them though I shouldn't
say ok I think they're fans because it
says PC cooling on it it might be found
fans I don't need a fan I've never seen
this box before from them what's going
on these are fans are they fans yes I
have I've never tested their fans out so
they might be okay - I don't know I've
only used their consent like 6 what
appear to be 120 millimeter fans they
just actually don't look terrible I mean
the feel as I pick it up is not quality
doesn't a screen quality they know look
at the gap between those they're like
great oh yeah no yeah knowing how much
time and effort Noctua put to like make
that pressures as small as possible
great like wow that's huge
yep but Asia horse but Asia horse but
these are a fraction of the cost of any
right they're probably so huge pay for
it here but hey maybe maybe
it's an RGB kit maybe there's content
somewhere here where I can compare this
to like a premium knock to a fan set and
nice to performance fan medical fan
interface please press fan one fan ten
order xs/s is very elaborate it's got a
nice adhesive pad on the back okay it's
well labeled alright we'll have to all
to investigate further the label time
he's yours thank you very much who's a
person that maybe Asia horse just sent
it from the RAM head we're pretty sure
they just had that ship which is a super
hard advertisement in that case I mean
they they do distribution themselves
probably as an Amazon seller so they
probably just shipped it from wherever
they do distribution right so that was
me yeah I'm just throwing stuff pectins
it's like Christmas morning
alright it's very very long letter here
from from Markos so I'm not gonna read
it but I will read it I'm not gonna read
on stream but he's only 13 and he moved
from his trashy laptop to a new PC nice
and I helped him build his new system
he's getting into PC gaming my videos
excite him consider yourself stimulated
Markos and he found me when he was
trying to learn how to build looking for
the steps needed want to see if he had
the skills to do it and he's got a 750ti
tempered glass case and yeah he's got
two hundred dollar budget for his
birthday coming up now so hopefully he
can do some upgrades there he's gonna
upgrade his cooling solution from the
stock cooler to something better
yeah he's very very gracious very cool
Thanks for writing in Marcos I wish you
all the best in your build yeah build
peterbilt is never done sir
so I keep working on it and it'll be the
dream build you've always dreamed of
never truly finished at some point so
I'm pretty sure see sonic sent you a
care package and that's what this what
why because I love you why don't they
just oh I know I this is I was gonna say
I changed my own question their calendar
I said I was about to say why did they
just email me and say hey and when I
send you stuff cuz it because I don't
reply to even it I'll answer you and I'm
really bad I'm a really bad emailer cool
that calendar all right I'm gonna I'm
gonna do a benchmark on this notepad
what is this I don't know I'm Mario C's
I've never seen a product from CSUN like
that's come in a box in this shape
don't tell me they make well cuz that's
the power supply what do you think it's
gonna be before I dump it on the table
of what do you think water bottle
thermos or something yeah coffee mug now
it's a mess right okay cool yeah mouse
pad we have a new house now with many
computers in it so yeah thank you see
sonic and thank you everyone for
watching cats after the live show we're
gonna get in and out if you switch over
my half life show the links in the
description thanks for watching baseball
