footprint without compromising on
features like flexible hardware
configurations a removable radiator
bracket for easy installation and
stellar cable management for a tidier
system Gaiman style with the tempered
glass side panel integrated RGB lighting
and a built-in cam powered smart device
to manage your lighting and fans do more
with less in the H 500 I click the link
below to learn more
alright y'all so this is the N Thule
build that I put together a while back
and it hasn't been able to post for the
last few months I'm not exactly sure
what's going on with it it's a super
high-end system it's probably around
$12,000 MSRP with a core I 979 ATX II
that's been deleted and a pair of GTX
1080p is in sli not to mention the plus
4 terabytes of nvme storage so this
thing's an absolute beast and it's kind
of just been sitting here it's a very
very heavy and expensive brick right now
so I'm gonna try to get to the bottom of
it today there is an error code on the
motherboard that's saying a zero which I
looked it up on the ROG form a zero
means all as well there's there's tons
of people reporting a zero on their
boards and they're using their computers
perfectly fine so not exactly sure
what's going on there's a couple basic
troubleshooting methods we can go
through clearing the CMOS to be doing a
BIOS flashback and a couple of things
before we decide to actually drain the
entire loop and start extracting
hardware for further troubleshooting
which is gonna be so much fun but
hopefully we can figure out the problem
before it comes to that I honestly have
no idea how this video is gonna end I'm
hoping that it ends with us being able
to boot into Windows and figure out
what's going on but we could very well
just be as much of the dark as we are
now so should be an adventure let's go
ahead and start off with clear net CMOS
which we should probably turn the
computer off first
fortunately the ram-paige 6 extreme
that's in here has a clear CMOS button
on the back so we don't even have to get
our hands dirty on the inside just got
to hold it down
think that ought to do it and let's boot
her up
how uh um so do have a video cable
plugged into the monitor up there one of
the monitors up there I'm not expecting
this to work because as you guys might
have expected I've already tried
clearing the CMOS I'm really just doing
it for this video so you guys can see
the whole process but yeah like I said
this hasn't booted in months so
obviously clearing the CMOS was one of
the first things that I tried but just
to see if it'll actually magically start
working on camera it doesn't seem to be
let's see what if the error code oh it's
it's double boot and it's double boot
ins give it a second give me a sign
please alright code a zero host error
clear CMOS fail so the next
troubleshooting step I want to take is
to update the BIOS via BIOS flashback
now this is something that I actually
haven't tried yet and was suggested to
me on Twitter by coalition gaming and I
believe J's two cents also back that up
saying that it's worked for him in the
past as well so I've got the BIOS right
on here the latest BIOS I'm gonna stick
it into the rear port woo and make it
made sure that it's in the right ports
and stuff and then I'm just gonna hold
down the BIOS flash back button until it
starts blinking blinking and then it's
just gonna keep blinking until it's
fully updated lights turned off BIOS has
finished updating boot number I'm sorry
this this this must have come from my
soon-to-be ex-wife and boot nothing so
far
oh there it goes double booting again
okay nothing's coming up on the screen
so I'm gonna double-check the error code
a - a - it went from easier so the post
code changed it was a zero meaning all
as well and now it's a - what is a - a -
seems to be a storage error meaning that
the system might not be able to identify
the OS disk properly there's only three
disks or drives in the system right now
there's a 960 Evo that has the operating
system on it and then there's - 2
terabyte 960 pros in the dim to external
PCB it's mounted straight to the
motherboard so I'm gonna remove that
card just gonna remove both of those
SSDs leaving only our OS disk and see if
that changes anything all right I've got
the den dot - right here - the SSDs
booted up see what happens
still says a - and unfortunately there's
no way for me to access that SSD without
draining and disassembling the entire
loop because it's mounted to the
motherboard underneath the motherboards
sort of shield or whatever it's a giant
plate that's being covered up by the
graphics cards and obviously you'd need
to tear down the loop in order to remove
those so all right well I was hoping it
wouldn't come to this but it looks like
I'm gonna have to drain the loop after
all if I want to take a closer look at
the drive and perhaps troubleshoot the
CPU but but that's ok I'm kind of glad
to see that the Primo chill View fluid
go after seeing what it's done to other
builders clogging up and cooking up
their loops and stuff so I'm fine with
it you know get rid of that poop in my
loop whatever so I think right now I
have to actually lift this thing move it
over to the kitchen area to begin the
draining process which means I'll need
to call upon the help of someone with
rippling muscles and superhuman strength
to help me lift it go out honey
you got it down easy all right good job
all right you can leave now
all right so here's the drain system
right off the bat you can see all this
crud left over from the primo chill view
it's just nasty it's even worse if you
look at the water blocks like here's a
GPU block and it's just solidified like
liquid is not supposed to do that so you
know maybe the the trick to water
cooling is it is water which is why I'm
gonna fill it up with distilled water
next and I'm done done using that fancy
fluid that just leaves a bunch of
garbage in your loop so anyway anyway
we're gonna do a little test boot I just
have a little temporary air cooler on
here and a 1070 TI just so we can get a
video signal as you guys remember the 79
80 XE does not have integrated graphics
which is why we need two discrete cards
so let me quickly plug in the power
scuse me I just had breakfast plug in
the power supply and boot okay I
remembered I remembered at the last
minute to unplug the pumps otherwise
they would have dry run and potentially
broke I'm really glad I bared that in
mind all right so things are spinning up
that's good
still nothing on screen Oh double boot
damn double boot if this works if it
just like boots instantly into Windows
I'm just gonna leave the system like
this I'm not gonna touch a thing oh my
god oh my god what what hmm maybe it was
the video card I'm wondering if this
wasn't properly mounted or if it wasn't
fully seated in its PCI Express slot I
mean it looked like it was totally fine
but you never know I think I'm gonna do
something right now that I would not
recommend anyone doing I'm actually
going to fill the block with water and
I'm just gonna like cap it off so that
it's not actually attached to a loop but
just just enough water to to handle
whatever idle temperatures just to see
if we can get it booted with just this
card installed and making sure that it's
firmly mounted in place so it should be
okay but again not recommended
all right let's fill er up
all right so here comes our really
sketchy test boot with the water-cooled
graphics card that is not really being
water-cooled um everyone cross your
fingers oh oh it's working it's working
okay okay
all right it's it's not the graphics
card but it kind of maybe is the
graphics card oh my god we're booting
into Windows Wow
all right so I'm quickly gonna shut this
off because I don't want the graphics
card to overheat or anything okay so
then what what's the deal
why if I reassemble the loop technically
everything should be fine right so the
only thing that really makes sense in my
mind is that the graphics card has just
not been seated properly this whole time
for like months and this could have all
been avoided all this troubleshooting
had I just move the graphics card in a
millimeter or two I'm not sure if that's
the situation I have really no way of
ever knowing but that's the only thing
that I can really think of right now as
to why we've been getting a black screen
for the last four months or whatever at
any rate I'm really not too disappointed
that I drained the loop because like I
said I'm really glad to get that primo
chill view fluid out of my system I'm
gonna be refilling the loop with good
old-fashioned distilled water this time
around maybe that's the sign I'm getting
old who knows and I also have to take
apart some of the other elements like
the radiators and reservoirs to actually
clean them out so that we get all that
gunk out before we refill hopefully the
second time around we'll have better
luck booting into Windows after all said
and done so on that note let's get to it
Oh would you look at that we're up and
running but why is the water so cloudy
you asked it looks like shoot yes yes it
does that's because if you could
probably tell from the montage I only
actually cleaned the water blocks and
the tubes
I didn't bother removing the radiators
or I guess the pumps I did I did clean
the reservoir tubes however just because
it would have taken me so long it's been
10 hours since I started this project
not that I'm complaining or anything I
just wanted to shave down time where I
could so that's why there's there's
still some poop in our loop but that's
okay
I've already flushed both of these loops
twice just to get as much crud out as
possible but I ran out of distilled
water went through two gallons already
today so wifey sauce is actually going
to the store to buy some more but I'm
not gonna fill in that part because it's
kind of boring but when she comes back
I'll be able to flush these loops a few
more times and get most of the garbage
out of the loop that should clear up any
of this cloudy business and I'll be sure
to reclaim these these reservoir tubes
because that is nasty all that aside
though the real point of this video is
to see if we could get this system back
up and running
and sure enough it oh yeah all the
hardware's detected looking good
it's notice that I don't have anything
plugged into my CPU fan header but I can
fix that in the BIOS and everything
should be fine so again I'm not exactly
sure what went wrong here if it was as
simple as a video card not being mounted
or what if you guys have any theories of
your own though please feel free to
share them in the comments not that we
can really validate it now it's a little
bit late for that but it'd still be
interesting to read so go ahead and blow
that up and that's pretty much all I got
for now guys I think I'm going to cut it
off here again it's been a ten-hour
process so I'm so ready to be done with
this I'm just glad that it's ended with
the system back up and running guys
thank you so much for taking this ride
along with me if you enjoyed the video
toss a like on it you know what to do
subscribe to the channel for more tech
stuff oh my that's really soon you can
also check me out on folks lane if you
want to watch my videos week really
without ads for 3 bucks a month i put a
link for that in the video description
till next time guys thanks for tuning in
have yourselves a good one and I'll see
y'all in the next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
