see the brand new hardware floors inside
of our new Oh
hardware they're supposed to look real
kind of real ish so the contractors
weren't fully done putting the floors in
yet but they're about halfway done or so
so we're actually gonna get our first
glimpse as to what our brand-new floors
in the house will look like which is
very exciting it can't be any worse than
the the existing blue carpet that was in
there so I have high hopes the floors
are horrible what if they're ugly and we
hate them and they're already half
installed we have to deal with it you
married that face by the way your choice
they don't ever tell you you have great
taste
not just in floors but in men
why are you talking alright
go in can we walk on this okay oh it's
dusty whoa nice that looks a lot better
that looks oh damn dude hey good job oh
it feels better to open those bad boys
up oh shoot
the kitchen all the way to the kitchen -
it's definitely more our style oh yeah
it's a dust fest in here let's not bring
any computers in here until all this has
come oh this is done - whoa the
bathrooms are still you guys remember
this what the tile used to look like
we're keeping the bathroom as is for now
okay so they're just getting started in
this room it goes all oh they did the
master already it's all done but once
the painting is all done in the entire
house it'll look real nuts
well yeah it's vinyl vinyl flooring
spc it's like a stone plastic composite
much more durable and has better
resistance to water it's actually
waterproof not just water-resistant so
that's why you can actually put it in
places like the kitchen without too much
worry I don't know I kind of missed the
blue carpet now obviously the living
room this is the actual the big living
room that's like the family room are
calling that the family room by the
entryway this is the big-ass living room
with the weird low ceiling that you guys
probably remember from the house tour
and we're saving this to the very end
because this is actually gonna be the
biggest project that we undertake for
this whole thing and we're probably
gonna continue the same thing we bought
enough flooring for the entire house so
when we're finally ready to do this part
of the house we'll have all the
materials we need that's good what do
you think mr. chicken well said he is
not a dumb chicken okay mr. chicken is
one of the family now and you just have
to learn to accept that he might be
different than us but that doesn't mean
we can't learn anything from him hey
will you you are so and this is coming
from the vegan you know our neighbors
are probably gonna think we have a pet
chicken they're like oh great they have
a chicken they're weird is that his new
home yeah chickens can't climb trees
looks like he's about to take a big jump
out of that lemon he blends in he could
be a lemon this is where he goes when
he's hiding from predators all right a
restaurant called joy now they whip up
some authentic tasting Taiwanese dishes
that are super tasty
five one beer which is called Taiwan
game
so I'm gonna tell you guys something
that you probably didn't know about me
my last name is I'm sure a lot of you
already know is Hanson and my family
they actually own the hanson soda brand
I'm basically the heir to a
multimillion-dollar company which is how
I hit a million subscribers on YouTube I
bought all of my subscribers each and
every one of you I bought all of you so
you all you all belong to me so good you
know sodas are a lot like farts everyone
loves their own brand what's going on in
here head to mr. chicken now they're
just trying to get acquainted with mr.
chicken you know he doesn't give a great
first impression but oh we're up to him
eventually I see you girl I see you
looking like a little creeper whoa
you're turning into the TV that's cool
you have three eyes four eyes back to
three you are a monster oh your head
just got twice as big and now
disappeared I have the craziest cat no
one's gonna believe this whoa there you
go oh it's she's evolving honey she's
got two heads now oh you ruined it
you've stunted her growth she was about
to be like an x-men Kitty and you just
totally stopped it now you're just a
regular boring cat all right well I'm
feeling pretty fat after that Taiwanese
meal not that I regret or anything but
one of us one of us regrets it
no make up your mind women
FairPoint anyway regardless of guilts we
feel it's only right that we follow up
that tremendous meal by getting
incredibly high
