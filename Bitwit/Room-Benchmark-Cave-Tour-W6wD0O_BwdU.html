awesomesauce news I thought I would take
this opportunity to do a little video a
tour of my room my new room as most of
you know I move recently to a new place
and I kind of just got settled in and
man it's it's it's quite a train wreck
right now it's really messy in here but
I think it proves for a more interesting
video than as opposed to if it were
really nice and neat and everything was
in place there wouldn't be as much crap
lying around to talk about so this is
pretty much where my desktop is it's a
still rocking the old Sandy Bridge 2600
k I guess it's not terribly old but it
is showing signs of age I'll have to
upgrade that soon but for my purposes
right now which is mainly just editing
and gaming it's doing just just fine
I've still got a gtx 670 in there i know
i'm pretty out of date but hey you know
I work for newegg I can get a new video
card anytime right huh no not really
just kidding if you guys are curious
about the peripherals at all I've
mentioned this in previous videos but
for those of you who haven't heard it
yet that's a CM storm trigger with
cherry MX Browns logitech g500 mouse and
my dt 880 pro biodynamic headphones
which are always awesome I've got a fan
to do some personal cooling huh and
you've got a little bose companion to
speaker system right there gets the job
done i usually use my gtat pros when I'm
gaming just because I sound amazing with
the ACU xonar essence STX sound card
that I still have in this system here's
a test bed from work this is what we use
for all of our testing at newegg TV it's
x79 platform it's got a 39 70 x clocked
at forty five hundred megahertz that's
definitely a decent overclock there it's
got a site in 120 x from coolermaster
cooling it down and that is a gtx 780
which i've been doing some testing on
recently i've also been testing the gtx
titan all over again so i could compare
it to the newer card that's just beneath
it but i'm not going to tell you what
that card is you guys can go ahead and
take a guess i think most of you will
probably know but that video is coming
out really soon probably the day of the
car launches actually and you guys are
in for a real treat when that video
comes out i might have a couple videos
for that actually that's that's scotch
scotch scotch scotch down down it goes
into my belly and this is a high res
panel that i ordered but i didn't order
this this is high res panel that i'm
borrowing from work it's 2560 by 1600
had just brought it home for the weekend
to do some more high res testing for you
guys and i actually won't have to be
bringing this home in a little
because I just ordered a cue next
monitor from newegg believe it or not
Cutex is one of those Korean panel
monitors just like the yamakasi catleap
that most of you know of and newegg now
sells a bunch of Korean panels if you
guys haven't checked that out already I
highly suggest you do so because i got
my monitor for about 350 bucks and it
uses the same panel as as in many of the
apple the Apple Apple displays so I'm
pretty good deal go ahead and check that
out here and give you a wider shot this
isn't actually my full room it's like
yeah I sleep right there that's my bed
in this corner this is just a little
look that I operate out of it is
connected to my room however let me back
up even further you can see there's a
little bit of a doorway there there's a
studio softbox light so that's about a
third of my room where I do all my
gaming and leisure and benchmarking this
is the rest of my room also a train
wreck a bunch of crap on my bed right
now because I've been testing there's
some hardware on there underneath all
that crap there's my fan because I get
hot and sweaty at night cuz I'm fat and
then there's my bed because I get tired
and I like to sleep guitar circus
curtains Jesus certain circus curtains
for sure and this is my little dresser
here with a leap motion on it that I've
never used in don't intend to not sure
why it's there and a copy of battlefield
4 and there's a flip minnow that you
guys haven't seen one of those in a
while and yeah and more scotch more
always more scotch and yeah that's
pretty much my room I did want to I did
want to do the roommate unveiling that
I've been talking about for so long now
but it's kind of been difficult to
coordinate with my roommates and
coordinate with their schedule but i
guarantee that is coming soon and i
guess i guess that might be a clue as to
what I've been benchmarking but I'm not
going to confirm that just yet you guys
can just keep guessing for now but yeah
I guarantee you guys on the roommate
unveiling is coming soon you guys are
probably gonna get a kick out of it and
and there's my Cadogan so thank you guys
for watching this video just a quick
little room tour because I haven't shown
you guys yet but yeah thanks for
watching the video please like the video
if you liked it dislike if you disliked
it and subscribe to awesomesauce news if
you haven't already I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
