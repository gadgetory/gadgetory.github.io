what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel so today's project is actually
gonna revolve around tackling a huge
issue or a need that we've been faced
with for the last couple of months here
on the channel you might notice that our
image quality for our videos has gone up
a notch and that's because one of the
reasons apart from Chris who's holding
the camera right now is the camera
itself which is the sony fs7
beautiful camera but it creates some
seriously huge file sizes one project
now that we create here in the studio
can can take anywhere from three to six
hundred gigs which is immense so the
other issue is that we have a couple
different editors besides me now me
Chris and wifey sauce and occasionally a
project will have to trade hands and
when that happens we either have to do
some musical chairs magic where we all
swap computers or we have to spend a lot
of time taking the files putting them on
an external drive and moving them to a
different computer it's uh it's been a
huge burden lately if you guys will come
this way for a moment you'll notice that
we have our three workstations set up
here let's take a look at one of them
this is the one that Chris usually works
on you can see that we've got a two
terabyte hard drive that's just kind of
for backup and then we have two one
terabyte SSDs that are already pretty
much filled to the brim and there's only
maybe two to five projects in each of
these drives guys so it's it's clearly
an issue and even worse is that we don't
currently have any good system worked
out for redundancy so if one of these
drives goes right now we're kind of
screwed and that data is completely lost
it's a freaking everyone out
wifey sauce has been under a lot of
stress lately and she doesn't even do
that much editing compared to Chris and
I I mean I should give her the benefit
that she's one of the most hard-working
people I've ever met personally and I
can't even imagine what I would do with
yeah yeah he does we take 10 minute
breaks every few hours it's like a
illegal thing so that is but anyway we
have a serious need that needs serious
tending to and I have the perfect
solution today I will be putting
together a 10 gigabit storage server
which is a project unlike any other that
I've ever taken on before and full
disclaimer I am a networking newbie
there's very little that I know about
hard core networking there's still much
for me to learn in this regard and also
a lot of the information that I share
with you guys today will be heavily
regurgitated from Wendell of level one
techs who was instrumental at helping me
get this project up off the ground so
huge thanks to him he taught me so much
in so little time and also helped me
source a lot of the hardware that you're
about to see so you guys haven't checked
out level one text yet I highly
recommend it there's some really great
content on there so with that in mind
let's take a look at some of this
hardware we're working with for starters
we have 24 8 terabyte and 302 C ba
enterprise level hard drives these
things are good for 24/7 operation and
it gives us a total of a hundred and
ninety two terabytes to work with now of
course we will be putting this in RAID
10 which is raid 1+0 so we kind of get
the best of both worlds in terms of
redundancy and performance so the
redundancy side of things that means
we'll actually be having the amount of
usable data here or usable storage I
should say so that's really only only 96
terabytes of workable storage but at
least we'll be safe in case of a drive
failure or multiple drive failures it
also gets us some speed performance by
striping the drives together meaning
that we'll actually be able to saturate
hopefully at least with the read speeds
a 110 gigabit per second connection
which is very exciting these drives will
be living inside of this disk shelf this
is an LSI SAS 6 gigabit per second disk
shelf we've got a redundant power supply
this is just going to be so much easier
especially because we'll be connecting
this to a host PC using just these two
cables which allows for just a very sexy
configuration
I mean imagine how many SATA cables you
would actually have to wire up if you
had them going to each individual drive
it would just be a madhouse so this is a
very clean solution that I'm very
excited to to take advantage of today
but let's talk about the host PC because
this is just a disc shelf after all
there's no onboard processing here so we
need an actual computer in order to do
all the heavy lifting will actually be
using the ZFS file system which is known
for being a very advanced and reliable
file system in that case we're gonna be
using FreeNAS loading it up onto an SSD
and booting up off of that that's not in
here yet but we'll get around to that
this is the trooper SC first off from
Coolermaster a very nice case tons of an
airflow I'll probably be adding some
more fans especially to certain areas in
the build that get extra hot under these
types of server storage storage server
workloads we wanted to go the economical
route so we went with Rison because it's
got you know high core and thread count
but also it supports things like ECC
memory and so we've got the risin 7 1700
in here we haven't done any overclocking
yet or anything like that not even sure
if we're going to yet the CPU is being
cooled by an Arctic freeze cooler with a
120 millimeter fan I kind of took a
chance on this cooler not sure if it's
going to work out we can always replace
it later down the line if not we've got
64 gigs of tritons er GB RAM before you
freak out this is just temporary to get
things up and running
we actually have a 128 gigabyte kit of G
snow kingston unbuffered ECC memory on
the way so yeah and then we also have
our X 370 motherboard the Tai Chi from
asrock beautiful board and has a lot of
connectivity all the bells and whistles
we could possibly need for this project
right here let's talk about what's
populating our PCI Express slots
starting with the EVGA geforce gtx 1050
Ti we're pretty much just gonna be using
this to connect a monitor so that we can
sort of visualize and monitor our system
real time and then we also have a 10
gigabit ethernet card here this is the
Intel X 540 t2 with dual rj45 ports
we'll be connecting this to our 10
gigabit 12 port switch and finally down
here we have our LSI SAS 6 gigabit per
second controller which is a got eight
channels to it so there's two ports on
the back four channels on each port and
if you do the math six gigabit per
second that gives us 48 gigabits of
bandwidth coming out of this thing which
is absolutely crazy one thing i aughtta
meant
that these SAS controllers are known to
get extremely hot under load but they
won't actually notify you or warn you at
least this one doesn't when it gets too
hot so it'll just end up dying if you
don't take care of it which is why I'm
probably gonna have to MacGyver at some
point a case fan that's aimed straight
at this card for dedicated airflow so we
don't run into any failures additionally
we have an Intel obtain 900 P SSD this
thing's an absolute animal 480 gigs this
is gonna be our cache drive it's known
for its incredibly high endurance I mean
you can literally write dozens of
petabytes to this thing before it
becomes unreliable and the read and
write speeds are just through the roof
some of the best write speeds on the
market right now and apart from that
we've got an 80 plus 650 watt g-series
power supply from C sonic but that's
pretty much our rig guys this is our
host PC that I cannot wait to get
connected to this dish disk shelf once
we've populated it with all of these
drives so let's go ahead and do that now
and hopefully by the end of this little
montage I'll be able to show you guys
this 10 gigabit storage server in action
q epic music
all right the NASS is finally up and
running
thank God it's been such a long process
I should mention that this today is like
about three or four days after the rest
of the video that you've already seen
because we had a weekend in between it
messed everything up but anyway we're up
and running it's functional there's
still a lot of optimizing that we have
to do to make sure everything's running
the best it can
but we're operational so that's good
right now all the drives are alive and
well knock on wood that they stay that
way for a long time but Wendell did
suggest that we hit the NASS hard with
tons of file transfers just to make sure
that none of these drives are defective
and peter out in the first couple of
weeks so maybe after about a week or two
if everything looks good then we'll
start using it for real I should mention
it's a little noisy in here because we
do have a large blower fan not the GPU
kind aimed straight at our Nick our ten
gigabit Nick and the the RAID controller
I thought this was an HPA I actually
ordered an HPA they sent me a rate
controller instead didn't even realize
it because I've never really worked with
either of those things
and I said Wendell the picture I was
like is this right he's like that's a
raid cart that's actually like a $300
brand new raid cart and I was like well
I paid 80 bucks for it and it was
supposed to be an HPA so we might we
might actually do a little trade because
I can still get everything up and
running with this raid cart in here but
an HPA just makes a lot more sense for
my needs and I think Wendell just really
really wants my rate card now everything
else is looking good there was a bit of
a swap aru inside of the system I don't
know if you can tell from there but the
m-dot 2 adapter that was connected to
our octane drive that was initially in
the bottom m2 slot of our system had to
move that up to the top slot because I
completely forgot that it's sharing
bandwidth with the bottom PCIe slot
which is where our NIC is currently so
the NIC wasn't working initially so I
had to pop that m dot 2 card up a few
notches and everything's working fine
now the blower fan might be a little
overkill it's kind of just what we had
at the time but I do have like a little
USB fan that probably makes a lot more
sense we can actually put the side panel
on and stuff getting back to the matter
at hand though I think it'd be really
cool to show you guys a quick demo of
this thing in action so why don't we
transfer over to the other room and I'll
give you a guys a gig
a bit of taste let's go alrighty here we
are
it declined PC and in the left window we
have our local storage we're actually on
a one terabyte nvme SSD right now I
believe this is our Rd 400 from OCZ and
you can see we've got a couple projects
in here this is the test file we'll be
using it is 50 2.8 gigabytes and and
over here on the right the window to the
right we actually have our our gnash
this is our Nass storage you can see
Network Nass and I create a little data
set or a folder if you will called test2
there's already a file in here I'm
actually it's the same one I just
renamed it but let's go ahead and
transfer this over and see what kind of
speeds were getting boom you right off
the bat oh we hit one gigabyte right
right from the get-go and then we kind
of dip down a little bit but we're still
getting anywhere from eight to nine
hundred megabytes a second whoo do that
so we're transferring about 50 almost 55
gigs here 53 gigs in under a minute guys
and we'll be able to achieve these same
types of transfer speeds when we're you
know transferring files between client
systems as well because they'll all be
connected to the ten gigabit switch 900
megabytes a second is pretty much right
in between what you would get out of a
SATA based SSD and an nvme SSD so I can
I can definitely live with that and
there we go sweet and if you guys want
to see a little bit more action here you
can open up premiere let me readjust the
camera really quick so this clip right
here is actually the file I just
transferred over to the nest so
technically we're editing on our client
PC but the footage is stored on our
servers so we're gonna go ahead just
test this out see how smooth it is this
is a 4k file
I'm haven't done any like sort of color
effects or anything like that but we're
we're at full resolution full 100%
scaling and I'm just gonna go ahead and
play it
see if it's move
books prefer it to good is clearly a
shot of Chris and wifey sauce populating
the disk shelf they're being very
helpful that day all right you can go to
2x here 4x
and I was choppy just for a split second
then it smoothed out pretty quickly 8x
and bear in mind guys I have not even
setup the obtained caching yet obtain
SSD caching something that I'm gonna set
up momentarily but this is pretty
promising so far considering I haven't
even messed around with that was this 8x
or 16x at any rate I don't think I
really edit at this speed very often so
this is more than enough performance and
it definitely feels like I'm editing off
of local storage which is exactly what
we want so altogether I'm going to call
this one a big win I'm gonna cut this
video off now because I've been working
on this for way too long
this was a super challenging yet equally
if not more so fulfilling project I I
have no regrets I'm so glad that we're
at the point we are now and and we're
not even done we actually have like I
said a lot more optimizing to do to get
our workflow exactly the way we want it
follow me on social media at bit wit
Kyle both on Twitter and Instagram I'll
be posting stuff about the server and
just sort of the progress we're making
behind the scenes that doesn't really
warrant a full video or a part two but
if you want to catch all the BTS stuff
go ahead and follow me there but that's
all that's all for now guys toss a like
on this video go ahead and ask me any
questions down below I'll try to get
around to them and get subscribe so you
don't miss any more stuff coming to the
channel very soon you can also check us
out on floatplane if you want to watch
our videos a week early without ads for
3 bucks a month I'll put a link in the
description below till next time guys
thank you so much for tuning in to this
one have a good one and I'll see y'all
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
