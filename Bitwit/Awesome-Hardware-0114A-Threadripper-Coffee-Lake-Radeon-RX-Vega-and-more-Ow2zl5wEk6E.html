if it actually like then you might
notice it happening cuz like then you
wouldn't turn around to be like oh my
god Peters updating it would narrate
while you just stood there helplessly
and it wouldn't allow you to I need a
bottle opener
oh my wife's car today she also has a
bottle opener on her keychain well you
aren't you just the perfect couple
well you do need one or you don't need
one I do need or don't need what well
look how sharp and clear it is in 60
frames per second hand it looks like ya
with the bitrate updated this time
reminding me by the way to update the
bitrate for my part in my half I don't
think I did that
twitch alright yes which were given
twitch a little bit more some more bits
this time and we're also given YouTube
more bits this time so hope you guys
like those extra bits welcome to awesome
hardware though so weird
what so we were just watching us in
60fps on Twitch like I'm not used to it
and and at not the last last time we
were here two weeks ago we were
streaming to twitch at 60 frames per
second I think 1080 I think we stream
extreme 1080 to twitch and it was at
twelve hundred megabits which is due to
justice which is pretty horrible yeah
but yeah yes
if you probably didn't row the show you
should now that we're streaming to
Bobbie who could and toy auction yes I
will choose to do that
welcome to awesome partner episode 114
side a that's a baker's a baker's no 13
I thought of 31 or 13 as a baker's dozen
right yeah but that's when you it's so
this is like a baker's just stickers
just ik dharmic Darby so what 14 tends
to be a baker's baker's dozen yeah
that's what I was getting at oh oh you
were doing the bean sup cheb behalf
sorry it's cool sorry I just haven't
figured it out as I was saying it okay I
really really did I didn't
I didn't have anywhere to go with that I
was glad that you interrupted yep
because made sense anyway so this is a
live show that poem I do every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific right here
on twitch.tv slash awesome hardware or
you can watch the show live on our
YouTube channels we actually split the
show up there in two halves the first
half this week is on my channel which is
a youtube.com slash c / bit wit and and
Paul's channel save it wit because
that's that that's not a URL but there
right thank you tell people exactly
where to go yes the C is the new format
the newer format that YouTube's
implemented about a year ago I feel like
you gave kind of a politician's pause
there my channel is youtube.com slash C
/ we don't we don't talk about my
youtube channel name because no one
knows what it really is but you haven't
changed it a while that's true that's
true I'm getting eight months draw in is
the longest streak I've ever had for not
changing my youtube channel name and
then at some point we're gonna cut on
youtube and we're gonna go over to
Paul's half on Paul's hardware show we
we technically like to do tech news
sometimes other times we talk about just
random shenanigans random nonsense have
to have some fun we also like to have a
tasty adult beverage once in a while so
here of legal legal drinking age then
you're more than welcome to join us
and we sometimes swear to use profane
words but only only when it's meaningful
and and and in in tastefully that's a
previous point yeah absolutely so
hopefully you're okay with that if not
then maybe you know kill the loved with
a little ones I mean they'll kill him so
put it hide them away I don't know why I
said kill them why was the first thing
that came to my mind murder no it's not
a good solution oh it's not they might
hear bad words in you quick kill that's
whole the problem on your hands if you
can help no one takes this show very
seriously I hope so too it's bad that's
also good advice if you're watching yes
start drinking alcohol now you're not
hopefully you weren't already drunk when
I said that statement all right
graceful intro let's move on to plugging
our stores we are selling merchandise in
both of our stores my stores they would
tec slash store you got fidget spinners
I got it spinning disc this is probably
a one-time what a dick thing there's
there's only a hundred of them and once
they're gone once they're all sold out I
probably will not be restocking them
there little additions these ball
bearings look so so I've seen fidget
spinners that are fully metal whereas
this housing is plastic so some will
write that off as lower quality but I
will say the plastic that makes them
lighter weight and easier to spin when I
first got a sample I was like I don't
really like this but wifey sauce
immediately was like I like this better
than your high quality metal one because
it's just easier for her to spin it
seems more tactile for whatever reason
to her so I mean everyone's got their
own preference on fidget spinners I
don't even know why we're giving this
one way to spin it but there they are
black fidget spinners they're color
neutral they match with any RGB
configuration you might throw at it it's
fantastic and there's a bunch of other
stuff on the story great salesperson yep
Paul's Hardware false doors I have
nothing new Paul's hardware net just the
old same old crap yep my store zero
insertion force shirt I think should be
making a comeback now that Rison is
gaining steam and oh yeah and everything
that zips off you got a sip side you got
as if socket got a rep processor
represented yeah zero insertion force
shirt I agree
anyway goodbye stuff will yell your name
at the end of the show if you buy from
both of our stores at the same time
that'll ship together you get a refund
impression no credit for shipping no
that doesn't happen anymore it doesn't
so our t-shirt guys knew our supplier
changed things so that domestic shipping
is much cheaper than it used to be cool
which we had a lot of complaints about
so hopefully that's fine now however
that also negates or cancels out the
shipping discount that you originally
received in the past that's no longer a
thing now just the flat rate for
shipping is much cheaper than it used to
be I guess it's not a flat flat rate
it's probably based on like weight and
stuff but yeah shipping should be much
better than it used to be
as far as international shipping I think
that's still ludicrously expensive so if
you're out of the country and you're
still buying something from our stores
we greatly appreciate it yes we
understand having to pay double double
the price of the actual product sucks a
lot indeed um so I guess we can roll
into our our first segment but before we
do quick be your call oh yes Mose
um I just finished or I'm about to
finish killing off this Ellie's Britton
brown ale from Avery brewing it's
fantastic Brown I thank you Paul for
supplying it of course I am drinking and
have been drinking and will be
continuing to drink this bootleggers
golden chaos which is a local beer from
just over the hill here in Fullerton
California bootleggers brewery it's a
Belgian ant
it is quite delicious yeah I like that
one Paul is also gifted me this 22 ounce
bottle of ruined ten triple IPA from
Stone yes it's a ten percenter whole
family how I wanted a nice a good IPA
and such I don't drink many IPAs not
because I hate IPA just they're not
mistaken I found these stone ones there
and they also had ten in the name and
it's because they're all ten percent
alcohol actually 10.8% so we get to my
half of the show Kyle's gonna be really
annoying yeah I mean more annoying than
I already a.m. so guys brace yourselves
like I preach that nervously I don't
wanna say annoying boisterous will be
sister√≠s its user words people don't
that's a good word wait no actually he's
no it's just is it it's just just mean
to say boisterous it's just not quite as
clear to that's not what it means like
you know that book a boolean you know
like like I don't know all right what
are we talking about today today we're
talking about first for starters we're
doing to fund or not to funds or not
where we take a look at a couple crowd
funded campaigns on popular websites
like indiegogo.com or Kickstarter the
first of which I think we're doing am
we're doing a mechanical or not a
mechanical but just a keyboard round up
here we're doing the first two or
keyboards so I thought there's sort of a
theme here I couldn't find the third
keyboard so
everyone's not a keyboard but the first
two are almost cutting almost had the
theming book almost a saving bonus so
close maybe next week so this is the SEO
or SEO I don't pronounce an industry
first luxury vintage keyboard remember
everything on every every crowdfunding
campaign is a world's first something
bear that in mind so this has already
been funded sixty three thousand dollars
if it's ten thousand dollar goal which
is leather sexy pretty pretty good
pretty good still has two weeks to go
and it's well over its it's cool it's a
typewriter inspired mechanical keyboard
with some very modern music I was
surprised
watching this video bluetooth option has
a wired or bluetooth option so it's kind
of cool they've given you some options
there I'd be curious to see how the
wireless so plays out Wireless and
mechanical keyboards generally aren't a
great mix there's usually some sort of
issue there but hopefully this one that
performs better the switch is that it's
actually using our kale blue switches
which might be a deal breaker for some
I've personally not terrible I'd use
kales in the past and they're not my
favorite I prefer cherry yeah they're
used to cherry switches you'll notice
them if you're not in your upgrading to
like a nice mechanical switch for the
first time I think like you wouldn't and
it's also yeah it's also one of those
things where kale switches aren't
necessarily bad when you're coming from
Cherry MX they're just different and I
feel like you can you just give them a
chance and actually your self some time
to get used to them they won't feel that
disgusting at first like you know
despite what your first impressions
might be coming straight from Cherry MX
but that being said the the super early
birds are currently sold out for $95 the
early adopter special is still available
however for a hundred and twenty bucks
carry the wired version and 144 the
Bluetooth keyboard if the Bluetooth is
solid and it's like there's like no
latency or virtually no perceptible
latency and it's just a solid
connectivity despite a bunch of like you
know wireless signals going around and
you're in your house and stuff I think
that's a pretty decent deal especially
for something this unique kind of makes
me want it's like remember like back in
the day or even now like you get like
some really cool sort of unique parts
it's like a smaller part let's say I see
you cooler and you're like well now I
got to just build a system with that
theme around this one little tiny
oh yeah stupid part it's like that's
nice this is like the gateway into
making like a ridiculously awesome
steampunk modded system right it's like
you have a you have the perfect
mechanical word like to to fit it now
and so now just makes me want to just
bend some copper pipes make a steampunk
machine like posh has kind of a rose
gold vibe tonight yes which classic posh
channel might quite as much yeah the
classic onic you print onyx honey thanks
onyx I always want st. Winx like a pink
pig
classic Lynx that's a Pokemon name yes
of course yeah and the classic art is
and I think it appealed to me a little
bit more yeah that's not a terrible
price for a mechanical switch keyboard
no granted if you're looking at kill
switches you can get something true
significantly tripping this but
obviously they go for the styling you
know the leather on there and every yeah
there's leather on it it's got genuine
materials and as in Galloway anyone
didn't I didn't catch FBI key caps were
annexed stems but I would imagine they
would be maybe and maybe not they look
it looks like even if they were though
why would you want to swap any of those
big apps I would say it ready to guess
I'd say probably yes
because if you're getting the kill
switches I think that's just what they
come yeah as far as a stem with rhymes
you would want to go out of your way to
customize that indeed by the way I'm
Annie thank you very much for your
donation I see it I see all your
donations we're gonna read all the
comments you attached to those said
donations at the end of each half of the
show so rest assured you will be heard
so just keep throwing us money we love
money
white fox mechanical keyboard is up next
the white fox
have you seen this keyboard have you
heard of it I have that have you can you
tell sounds like an international spy
have you dreamed of it white fox white
box this is what Fox has been
compromised
all right white fox is a go
yeah no absolutely definitely some code
words going on here but get this
it had $100,000 goal which is pretty
steep that's a lot of money for a
mechanic
keyboard project like this it's also a
candy bar and it met three hundred and
seventy thousand more than over well
over a third of half a third of a
million dollars and has been met it's
fully programmable well look at that
little fox key cab I know it's adorable
wait wait wait
oh I'm buying it I'm buying it just a
little foxy he's so cute that's adorable
they should at least sell the key caps
I'm surprised they haven't hit a million
right to be honest that little fox
doesn't all and it's and it's PBT oh and
it's a PBT cute fox key cap oh and
Matteo Spinelli made it he looks nice
he's a keyboard user he's got kind of a
I mean I only trust him to make my I'm a
great judge of character
yeah an off the bat and I've been that's
not at all because I've been watching
Game of Thrones and and I keep hearing
Tyrion say that but he looks he looks
like an Ernest you know honest person he
does and the shots well lit so I trust
them it is and look at that hat although
I'm not sure if the Hat is the best idea
the Hat and glider has it's probably a
friend's that he is letting hit he's
letting that his friend with a weird hat
stay over at his house because he's in
order to live which further proves he's
such a nice guy that you should
definitely buy anything doesn't add some
depth to the shot absolutely look
origami
look it's a little origami Fox I know
it's there's just so this is how you do
a freaking Kickstarter video to people
foxes so many QD axes USB type-c
connector isn't that amazing it's also
now a female what USB type-c connector
oh good that's very good way better than
any sort of mini or micro option that
you have yeah they've all worn out for
me all all of my keyboards that don't
have a routing Channel or a cable
routing channel or whatever have all
worn out the their mini or micro USB
ports in some way or up the cable
just because they're not they're not
meant to sustain that sort of weight the
phone's fine a giant ass keyboard is not
I say giant ass but that's with a grain
of salt this is clearly a compact option
the switches however are custom in-house
hallo switches they're calling them
hallo switches which are smooth tactile
and become firmer the harder you press
them
that's the halo true switches and they
have halo clears which are pretty much
the same as the halo true
but with the spring weight that's closer
to Cherry MX clear okay and then they
have K hua have you ever heard of this
switch okay Cale but it's too uh blue
not familiar with ke kula it's not in
house but it's available as an option it
features a tactile bump and click this
is a hundred and $59 keyboard with no
switches so if you wanted the DIY kit
that has no switches and you just wanted
to you know add your own MX stem
switches that you got off of mass drop
or whatever some eBay resellers I want
to say Chi 1 Chi hua Chi Quan Chi qua
like like cool way like wobbly I'm go
away Kwok way if the wah I want hua is
like Huawei then Chi quoi I think I'm I
think I think we need to call upon the
powers of a little texture you need to
call upon the powers of baby Chow to
help us out with this pronunciation even
chap ryos buckle but he won't tell us CB
Chow let us know how do you pronounce it
he's like the guy on teamspeak is like
i'm like i have a normal Macker so $169
it's pretty steep hundred sizes and
nobody hears it seventy bucks for the
halo or a cape Wow watts which is more
expensive than the typewriter keyboard
for sure but maybe a little bit higher
body or just a bit more mainstream who
knows Wow wait and then finally have the
ice bin s I felt like this was just I
had I had to talk about this since I
announced the fidgets spinner this is
the most innovative fidget spinner ever
they can take it apart the I know you
can't you can customize the no it
doesn't even do that you can't even
customize it's just showing you how it's
built but it spins horizontally and
vertically look at look at the way it's
spinning it spins and all of those six
heads or whatever they'll spin and it's
been apparently up to five minutes five
minute horizontal spindle look at how
long that spins and it spins up to two
minutes to make own that way like the
bearings are sick bro
sick there's using sick bearings it's
using seven six bearings and twenty
eight sick CNC machined parts look at
look at look at this guy look how much
fun he's having and look you can like
strip it down to be a mini spinner
so if you only wanted like three of them
on there or two of them on there like if
you're going somewhere with a metal
detector
but the dilling detects objects that are
a certain size and you want to lay it
down with your spinner yep
assuming they'd not letting people in
with spinners that's true very common
that's very true
it's great for like no snow fidget
spinner zones where they don't allow
them because you can just disassemble
and be like no it's just a bunch of
random CNC machine parts that I carry
around for no reason
IV let me put it put it together later
I've used the fidget spinner like twice
now yeah but I'm immediately like a
connoisseur of the bearings that they
use because when they when the bearings
are crappy yeah it's the whole the
spinner is crappy yeah but that's as far
as I guess absolutely if it is finished
it's weird like it's one of those weird
things kind of grows on you even $53,000
they've raised for this yep over a
quarter of a million dollars for a
freaking digit spinner it's insane
29 bucks - and they're charging 29 bucks
for the earlybird 30 bucks for a fidget
spinner damn minor $9.99 but I mean by
three of mine but when you look a blue
together when you look at the different
ways it spins it's like buying three or
four more different spinners because it
spins in different directions it's no
I'm not buying that it's like three and
one I'm not buying that in a literal and
figurative way $1700 you get a hundred
pieces a time wanna order let's remember
to order the 100 piece buy-in I'm
Brandon with Paul's hardwood about mine
so in my store y'all time Thank You buck
so Mike Kyle should eve visit fidget
spinner by my pins $50 way bet on this
thing you'll use for one hour it's the
last one you'd ever need them it's just
that's why you know what Paul I think we
just have to get our hands on one
eventually and figure out if that's the
case but until then I don't know which
of these three to find are not to fund
items did you did tickled your fancy the
most I think the white fox is probably
the one that stood out I mean just as
though if I had to choose one of these
yeah the white fox cuz I mean fidgets
spinners ultimately let's be honest
they're stupid
unless you're invited once those are
awesome
oh yeah except I'm sorry official
spinners are awesome there won't you buy
them supporting your favorite youtuber
they're very useful they contribute a
ton to society and they don't I don't
know I shouldn't talk trash em fidget
spinners because if I had like a kid
with with like it was like a hyper kid
or something yeah and you can just give
it to him and then I'm just sitting
there or they're they're really popular
with like kids with autism like they're
supposed to just like sort of mellow
them out and you're like I shouldn't be
I shouldn't be you're right I've learned
something today it's like if it's like
it's like a version of like a joint like
if someone if you are like relaxed they
have my hard day smother the joint and
someone just like look you're like
joints you stupid joints you're just a
fad you'd be like dude this is chilling
me out bro just let me let me smoke my
joint it's like it's like let me let me
spin my aunt's house Phoenix how that
would go
I mean joint dozen like you know
marijuana marijuana that's exactly what
I mean yeah we're in California after
all we are indeed around we're
automatically potted hey let's move on
to our next segment which is bit mob
easy whoo yeah I'm a PC here we go have
pcs we are pimping them well Pippin
bringing them onto the street selling
them to John's to be taken into dark
alleys y'all
yes any tips or enix no the John's at
what they take the the the the PC would
be the prostitute in this analogy going
to have intercourse with them oh the
John's right the John's and then
Alliance yeah that's the point
yep dark alley chief hotel room
depending how high-class the PC is of
course that's what this is all about
determining how much money we can sell
sex with your PC for let's get started
I wonder if they call them John's
because after they have sex with the
prostitutes they yell Johnson I mean
what if they could happen they're
ballers that's what they do
Hey all right Jacob Jacob Jingleheimer
Schmidt and music stage for 40 that's
nzg Wow
I know
company of a brand they make cases and
beg saying music is very popular in H
440 though by NZXT a very good case I
have one right behind me - all right
66 under K at four point three gigahertz
creaking a cracking I'm sorry I feel I
feel bad too I feel bad for whoever has
the Twitter handle for as they just got
tagged in this is they have fifty six
point five thousand followers and then
tweeted eight times who is following who
is four following five horsepower again
technically for someone thought of that
 day oh my god please tell me you
have to be logged in you can check it on
here I'm very curious to find that out
though come on alright save for two z170
motherboard at GTX 970 2.5 terabyte hard
drive by WD 16 gigs of g.skill ripjaws
ddr4 and of course there 650 650 watt
power supply I presume
all right are they following United for
United Airlines little of it no sense
doesn't what are the eight tweets are
there eight tweets all bitching about
United how did they join in 2012 that
doesn't make sense they have one one
about you find a good profile picture
people say I own as accountant never use
it that's not true April April of wait
April lemon I guess I've just hear that
said that that too but then before that
I was the last week before that was 2015
he said I never I never used as a
countenance on that's not true I use as
a cam 24 and then he didn't wait for two
years what a liar hey I'm gonna follow
everyone go follow for everyone go
follow at four on Twitter I'm just all
the out of it we're gonna we're
gonna we're gonna revive we're gonna
change things we're gonna still gonna
make a difference we're gonna dip if you
late the out of this this Twitter
account
we need to bring him out how to Rochelle
get him socializing again he could be
you know what if he's like a hermit he's
he's sitting there yeah
we're breaking the depression cycle for
know for helping people getting them out
there it's what the show is all about
raid all right Twitter raid all right
let me remind you focus we are
attempting you're a sushi place yes that
close right caress specific time all
right so so what what it just just
you're right you're right all right
focus focus time here we go all right
Jacob
I like your cable management your build
looks nice it's it's tight I think you
did a good job with what you got going
on here you I mean you have that X 62
and there you yeah you're fine with the
66 under K I would like look look around
and see if you can find a cheap 7700 K
or 6700 K I mean just just just to see
if you can find one just to go just to
match up a little bit more nicely with
that that sequence really but actually
no I take that back
you really needs as an SSD you don't
have an SSD inertia oh yeah and of
course you got the ketchup and mustard
cables going on which we always say
could use a cable extension but yeah
you got a nice build in here I'm sure
you do a great job if you're gaming it
at 1080 right yeah okay i I've even gave
me 1440 just on some games you know high
settings okay next up is Damian Ford he
has an FX 6300 builds so a little
old-school AMD path here 16 gigs of ddr3
a samsung 250 gig SSD three one terabyte
2.5 2.5 inch hard drives oh yeah it's
got some some notebook drives in there
that's a nice little entry-level build
for sure and it's pretty clean yeah like
cable management's on point certainly I
mean other than like the the hideous
ketchup and mustard 24 pin I mean if he
just found an extension for that so
here's all right this this obviously
carries less weight now but you have an
RX 480 in there
you should have sold that like two weeks
ago and and and updated everything else
in your system yeah
and bought I mean I don't know you can
you yeah whatever
have no video card though you don't know
video card you're right I feel like you
could have done some bartering some
trading around though you'd be angry and
he could have traded up at that are X
480 it's it's less valid now because the
prices are dropping for those but I know
what you mean he could have probably net
for the for the pricey for what he would
have sold that rx 484 he'd probably
could have gotten like a rise in CPU and
mother yeah I mean if you did it at the
right time you could have jumped from a
480 to a 1070 and just done a straight
GPU upgrade yeah straight across but
yeah again I mean obviously this is rich
aspect and all yeah but yeah your kill
management looks really nice given that
using kind of a budget power supply and
everything everything's really clean
again you got the kitten ketchup and
mustard cables to worry about but I
would say you're looking at like
upgrading your CPU cooler first before
you go at upgrading something like
getting sleeved extension cables yeah
but yeah that cooler is pretty atrocious
you can get really noisy yeah but
honestly what I would say is you know
keep your eye out for certain Rison path
upgrades that you might have in the
future obviously you have an AMD system
and and if you're if you're down for the
AMD people you might have a very nice
upgrade to these 6300 come in that
pretty soon yeah so that's cool next up
we've got to the mage meister oh wait
yeah with an FX 6300 as well I said
before gigahertz in our X 480 as well
very similar system to the one we just
looked at one terabyte a 7200 k 7200 100
rpm hard drive oh yeah it was always
talking about yeah and then we've got
favor to give okay so I think color
clashing is is happening to some degree
just the red and blue it's interesting
that you've got blue SATA cable daresay
the cables here definitely stand out and
don't blend
so with your color scheme much so I
don't know swapping those out and
redoing your cable management might be a
way to tidy things up in here a little
bit if you're concerned about your
aesthetics obviously that we can't also
see your entire system we don't have
here we don't know what your kind of
side panel you're working with here so
if you don't have a window on your side
panel then probably right I don't care
quite as much but if he made the
submission to us then there's that are
you just seeking fame the fame and
recognition that comes with being
featured on Pitt my PC which obviously
has this very significant monetary value
oh yeah me too much for just retired mr.
so alright I think a new case would be
good yeah it looks like your drives are
a little cramped there I mean it's I
mean Bravo for efficiency just being
able to cram those two two and a half
inch hard drives and that three and a
half inch they're still in that little
space there it's really kind of compact
and well done but I feel like yeah I
feel like there just might be some other
cases out there for not very much money
some some nice budget cases that would
just give you a lot more room for all
the drives that you have and at that
point just upgrade your your whole
platform as a whole I would say kind of
like the last guy you know see I see
what rising upgrade paths are available
to you you can get in on Rison for
pretty cheap right now
or soon we're soon yes very soon yeah I
mean it's pretty much all I have to say
good good good all right let's move on
thanks mate ah I closed it Joseph I
closed Joseph's tab Joseph has a no he
doesn't you can't you can't oh because I
see I'm gonna reveal our stuff for info
don't can't see your show yeah it's not
that big of a deal but yes it is let's
just so you can't show more hands so
Joseph's got a core i5 3450 in rx4 60s
so this is pretty much a budget build
more or less 12 gigs of DDR
three if I voted to get card driving 240
gig SSD and this is in sight of the
Entech VSK 4000 e pretty pretty budget
case as well so it's it's it's difficult
to tell people hold on hold on let's
start off by taking a quick gander at
the side panel here I'm assuming you
might have you hadn't noticed this no
this wasn't part of the reason I I did
not I did not even notice that I I it's
this even hold these submissions really
quickly is this this doesn't even look
like the original side panel of the case
this looks like a sheet of scrap metal
or something like that then he just
tapes it on that was cut it also looks
like there's just a hole here a window
there's actually no glass order yeah
it's it's this looks like kind of a
rough cut with with the jigsaw or
something like that out of the metal
maybe it's a work in progress and I
can't imagine why it would be lying
there unless it's used this a side panel
of the case right like like he just
literally folded it down so we can take
a picture yeah why else is that lying
there like that and it's the width it's
the width of the gap you'd look inside
the case so that's that's interesting
that's that's all I'm saying is that's
interesting right there hmm
okay so other than that kale management
is not so tidy we could use some you
know take take all this mess at the top
and tie it up so go straight over into
your five and a quarter inch drive cages
over here put any extra excess you have
tie it up over there
yeah figure out something to do with
this mess you got coming up from the
drives we're just getting a mayonnaise
or just get a new case yeah I mean like
the just off the top of my head this
this screw doesn't look like it's stuck
there I think I don't think for whatever
Drive is that sloping in alright like
you can get again a decent case for like
50 bucks like the Focus G from fractal
that just came out 50 bucks and it has a
large acrylic window where you would not
have to resort
- you know just doing it yourself type
of thing like it looks like you've done
and your core components I mean hike it
for some reason it looks like your
motherboards blue I don't know what the
heck's going on with that yeah
definitely right yeah okay so but your
car components aren't terrible looking
down here I mean if you swap those into
a case that had a painted interior and
looked a little bit better like that
would and managed up the cables it would
they would greatly improve the overall
appearance yeah I hope you get rid of
this this also looks dangerous are you
gonna cut yourself yeah blow too much
blood catches your hand right under the
edge right there what's up with the
power supply why is it look like March
it's a smart power spot yeah but what's
that residue on it or is that just like
a glare thing no I think that's part of
the I want that's part of the graphic I
think well because it ends because it
just stops right here if it was a stain
coming down it wouldn't it would
continue over this part of the it's like
power supplies aren't reflective at all
like especially those kind I mean it's
also there's no brand here anything I
have never heard of smart whatever smart
650 it's 80 plus gold you're saying it's
phase and that many of you saying it's
cool well I'm just saying it's a it's a
very generic like not not a very well
known brand power supply so I can't
imagine it being you know super high-end
or anything like that yeah cables aren't
terrible but anyway obviously the system
could use a bit of work but I'd say the
the number one advice to be getting a
case yeah
invest in a case spend fifty to seventy
dollars on a new case that you can use
for a while it'll fit your stuff
it'll be nice all right we got one more
we've got young fifty and fifty fifty
with FX 8350 build yeah twelve gtx 1070
from asus and eight gigs of ddr3 all
right he lost the side panels he says
lossless how do you lose side panels no
no but that must have been what happened
the last dude - yeah but boom hey I was
I will say 50 young 50
look what happened to our last entry
here on
my PC he lost his side panel yeah he
improvised he didn't something he did
something about it
yep Tom's saying although I don't I
don't think even if this guy had his
side panel still that he'd be able to
fit them on with all the entrails of
cables heard Hank out of his case
floating around see what's going on man
you used to call someone for you it
seems like it lack of carrying it the
case is also down on the ground I mean I
can't imagine he brought it down here to
take the picture this is where the case
is yeah maybe you brought it out from
the wall to take take the pictures or
whatever but there's lots of dust down
in here so covered this case is lacking
some love this PC is lacking some love I
feel like you need to sort of reevaluate
your relationship with the computer and
those aren't love stains and you know
it's probably it looks like it's been
doing work for you I mean you got an
eight-core FX 8350 in there you got a
gtx 1070 the 80/20 50 by the way is
holding that 1070 back to some degree I
mean it's not terrible or anything but
you could get more frames out of it but
you know you got not a terrible system
in here you I feel like it should be
showing a little bit more love yeah and
beyond that like I mean I don't want to
nitpick stuff because there's just too
many old details that could be fixed
around in here yeah but yeah go get a
piece of sheet metal start cutting
yourself some new windows or just buy a
case of Sipan new side panel yes any
case any any case of it right now we'll
have that all right thanks 50 all right
that's going concluded prepare my PC
thank you guys so much for submitting
all those pictures there were so many
submissions that I had to sift through
today which I highly appreciate so if
you didn't get picked this week
don't fear there will be another
opportunity plenty of more opportunities
in the future but for now we can go
ahead and move on to tech news let's
talk about some of the trending stories
in our little DIY PC community first of
which being the Radeon RX Vega had some
of its 3d mark firestrike benchmarks
leaked holy crap this is from video
cards come read cards and the listing on
is if they found doesn't say which rx
Vega is being tested so we remember you
don't know we don't know if this is a
high-end Vega card or
in Vega card but it got a score a GPU
score in 3dmark fire strike of
twenty-two thousand three hundred and
thirty which trails closely behind the
GTX 1080 specifically MSI's GTX today
the gaming X which was clocked at
nineteen hundred and twenty four
megahertz so it doesn't look like that
ten eighty was overclocked so it looks
like a more or less like factory
overclocked ten eighty from an Edward
partner but not super heavily
overclocked if if at all and then me and
if this is if this is average frequency
then that's that's a decent overclock
factory yeah I'm just saying like they
didn't try to push it you know past two
gigahertz or yeah that may be point one
gigahertz or anything like that and get
over to over to and the Vega the Vega of
the radian rxt Vega is caught at sixteen
hundred and thirty megahertz so we are
unsure if the if the card was tested in
gaming or silent mode obviously gaming
mode would probably increase the core
clock a little bit at the expense of
some acoustics at that thing but that
didn't make a difference oh do they not
so what is it didn't didn't PC
perspective and gamers Nexus test gaming
mode versus not gaming mode and there's
basically the same thing I could nothing
changed they test it with our Radeon rx
Bagan that's true this is this yeah that
would be the frontier Edition which is
the crossover workstation card so I'm
not sure I'm not sure if that's that
would apply I'm surprised the frontier
Edition even has a gaming mode like well
it's supposed to but I mean it's
supposed to be a driver thing or
whatever but um yeah so the frontier
Edition clock speed is 1440 megahertz
and a boost clock of 1600 this is
running a little bit faster than that
1630 yeah
about 200 megahertz faster and it's just
barely barely behind the 1080 like no no
visible difference in performance I
would imagine to 300 points if you're
gaming like with two of those systems
side-by-side 1080 is probably gonna give
you the same amount of experience
performance as an hour radio an Rx Vega
which kind of explains why at the demo
last week that we talked about
AMV had two systems side-by-side one
with the GTX 1080 the other with a
Radeon rx Vega and they weren't showing
the frame counters or anything but most
of the people that were attending could
not tell the difference between your
system which I guess at this if the
3dmark fire strike scores are this close
on the GPU side then probably makes
sense yes I mean to me to me that says
you know obviously that's that's not the
type of demo that you want to be showing
people right before the GPU launches
just because you're trying to say like
look you can't really tell the
difference right yeah because what's
probably gonna happen is it's is it's
gonna launch and people are gonna test
it and they're gonna say all right the
Vega is just a couple percentage points
behind a 1080 yeah and if AMD prices it
you know reasonably that'll be a good
cart for them and they can sell it and
you know whatever but it's not gonna
compete with the 1080 TI apparently
right based on all this and it's not
going to be something that you can say
this beats a 1080 T or a 1080 even yeah
maybe
I'm sure there's obviously different
tests and different things like that so
I don't know aim D's in a situation
where they need to probably price Vega
aggressively in order to compete with
NVIDIA yeah and it's definitely going to
be a disappointment although something
that we've probably seen coming based on
a lot of the rumors and speculation in
the past couple months yeah it's it's
too bad that AMD after so much time
isn't able to come out with something
that is able to match or beat the 1080i
which has been out for quite some time
now on the Nvidia site or even the 1080
again like if if they sold it for less
than the gtx 1070 or something like that
that would stick it to nvidia pretty
hard but i can't imagine them doing that
yeah I mean there's at the end that
would cut I think that would cut too
much into their profit as far as how
much they've invested in the development
of Vega yeah so yeah I mean it's going
to be something that is priced
competitive with
ten eighty probably around the same
price or maybe a little bit less yeah
based on this again and we don't know
for sure yet it's kind of a bummer
because there was so much hype around
radeon RX Vega and I mean they made like
a new logo for it and everything yeah
we're just like oh my god it's gonna
bring the greatest most cutting-edge
fastest GPU and there's there's
different ways they might implement it
as well you know like you know we
haven't seen a dual GPU card from Nvidia
for a very long time and that is a way
that AMD has been able to say we have
two fastest graphics card in the past is
because they made a dual GPU version of
something you know but they didn't dual
Vega though that'd be pretty intense
though because they're 300 what when is
it 300 watt TDP that's speculated or I
don't know but it's supposed to be a
pretty high tbp and it's known to get
pretty hot I want to do a little bigoted
GPU that comes with a 240 millimeter
all-in-one cooler attached to it that's
all that's all you need one of those at
the bottom of your system for the
graphics card and then another one at
the top for your CPU oh go great with
your your you know your 16 core thread
Ripper CPU that also needs a 240
millimeter AO baseline that ever seen
we're seeing him you lose a kid being
hot again
AMD so hot right now beginning if
another Golden Age of like jokes about
computers being too hot it's like Oh
take like Vega and you know a 70 900 X
and put them in the same system and then
you know make make s'mores over them or
something I don't know but yes yeah
again SIGGRAPH which is next week it's
supposed to have the Vega launch so
hopefully we'll see more yeah so guys
let us know in chat how much you would
pay for a Radeon rx Vega if it was just
ever so slightly slower than the GTX
1080 what he thinks a fair price low
snow and chat and the next up we've got
some news on coffee lake this this
article comes from tom's hardware and
this is about some leaked benchmark
and specifications that you guys might
be interested in this is according to a
Morris I soft sandra soft yes
sigh soft wet an official live rancor
submission there is an anonymous user
who had apparently benchmarked CPU that
looks to be a hexa core coffee-like CPU
and we're gonna tell you exactly why
they're so sure that it is indeed coffee
Lake and I see a lot of you guys in chat
saying anywhere from 350 for RX Vega to
450 there's a couple 500s in there
not many 350 I think is pretty that'd be
pretty killer 350 I think a lot of
people would go for a GTX 1080
performance card more or less for that
price I think the Vega not as not as
fast Vega what might be 350 yes the
low-end Vega for sure cool alright great
someone said 750 holy alright cool
today I mean AMD AMD doesn't have much
of a competitive card at the $40 price
point right now so $400 for 150 bucks
yeah it's still gonna be some of the
market share they can pull from Nvidia
yeah and I do think there is still a
very strong argument to be made for an
AMD GPU combined with a precinct monitor
yeah yeah of course is the the session
the matter to like larger size better
refresh rate monitors but freesync
compatibility for like - 300 bucks
cheaper than the comparable and video
monitor would be you know something
there's something to be said for that so
um yeah I think I think of yeah I want
to get to RX Vegas in that and almost
hit a slot in crossfire and do some
testing with that
I'm sure that will happen I didn't say
that out loud
all right so this back to the benchmarks
this was a against AI software sigh soft
there was a listing that someone had
benchmarked this it was listed as
genuine Intel CPU zero zero zero zero
sounds very genuine at 3.1 gigahertz six
core twelve thread 3.1 gigahertz 4.2
gigahertz 2.7 just a bunch of freaking
frequency numbers this is what the
actual listing said it said CPU zero
zero zero which doesn't indicate coffee
lake but the fact that it's a six core
twelfth red part which it does say makes
you a little bit curious like maybe it
is coffee like so Tom's hide word did a
little bit more investigation and found
that under the computer device listing
that the video adapter was listed as
Intel coffee lake u HD Graphics boom and
the general processor was listed as
Intel coffee Lake Mobile graphics which
means it's a smoking gun right there
it's a smoking gun man it's probably
genuine because it'd be pretty hard to
fake the hardware IDs for the embedded
GPU obviously man it's called Hardware
I've only tried it twice that's why it's
called hardware it's not easy we're
bitches all we know right now apart from
that is that coffee leak is supposed to
launch in the second half of 2017 that's
this year that means in the next few
months it could be a month or two from
now coffee Lake will make its debut and
it's gonna be built on the third
generation of 14 nanometer or 14 + +
architecture tom-tom hardware sources
say that the launch is coming before the
summer ends well that is fairly soon
feels like it's like we're gonna have
lots of content lots have got no
shortage of contents - to cover in the
next coming months so that's very
exciting
it appears that Intel can like put the
foot on the gas when there's actually
some competition yeah and actually
somewhat seem like they're totally ready
for it and not
doing some premature launch
next up about Intel as well not all not
all is super rosy over there and in some
Intel their principal engineer just quit
after 20 years invested into the company
this is an article from MIT tech comm
their principal engineer Francois and
Pauli in your great pronunciation wisdom
can help me pronounce his less high PI D
Noel pide pide pide Noel I didn't know I
just got a sound it out pi PI D D Noel I
well it's a really bad pronunciation of
his name I feel like you're doing a
horrible job right clearly bad you
didn't do it
yeah but it's but it's French so like no
its way to say horrible so let's just
call him Francois
he joined Intel in 1997 as a principal
engineer and he has a quite impressive
resume he's got a lot of experience
under his belt he fathered the company's
first dual processor high-end desktop
platform skull trail
solid he launched the extreme edition
brand no big deal optimized performance
on the Pentium 4 and aided engineering
of the canoe the Katmai Conroe Penryn
and Nehalem cpu Nehalem I would never
pronounced Nehalem I'd be like a little
town of Nehalem little town of Nehalem
and Sandy Bridge to skylake KB Lake sky
like X and atom SOC product families
notice how they never mentioned that he
ever worked on KB like X like just like
no that's where I draw the line
woof KT like X is what made him quit
that's probably he refuses to take part
in it and that's why he's walking I
would not be associated with the company
that would francois graphic technology
so he announced his resignation and he
assured people that he would not be
moving to a me because that's everyone's
first question you're quitting are you
going to AMD you're joining the dark
side aren't you you're joining team red
aren't you he
said never and I quote never never
because my knowledge about Intel is too
deep I would get lawyers knocking on my
door next day and I've worked with PC
and CPU platforms for twenty years it's
time to do something different I respect
that I respect that it's a noble wage to
sort of sign on probably painting
probably painting or you know just
Netflix and chilling with his wife or
something like that yeah who knows what
the guys do it I mean he could do
whatever he wants whenever it's fine
Intel however might have been surprised
by this move because they have not
issued any sort of public announcement
that he has left the company oh it's
kind of confusing and sort of a question
as to if he even notified them that he
was resigning or if this kind of comes
out of nowhere and they declined the
comment to bit techcom from this article
so I guess I guess that just leaves us
to wonder what France was next adventure
will be if not in CPU processor DIY
glorious glorious Fantasyland
what what would fit what would Francois
be doing what do you think he's gonna be
doing I mean he doesn't do right no I
was hoping that there'd be like if you
know like a dream sequence a dream -
Francois dancing why don't we have a
showrunner who like his I don't know
about that beforehand just because we
set for small kid you've been to show we
have the thought though no one like you
guys can all imagine how that would be
right yeah super cool we our special
effects relies on your imagination so
kudos to you Francois thank you for all
the work you've done at Intel and we
wish you the best of luck in your future
endeavor whatever it may be so and
hopefully Intel's not shooting your
brick right now we're already in the
hole there's even more so now let's talk
about the Red River shall we
we shall more specifically not about its
specs not about how it's gonna change
the landscape of our industry but what
kind of box it comes because that's the
important stuff
AMD recently unveiled thread rippers
retail package
and it is incredible look at that just
look at it just look at it's kind of got
as the article says it's kind of got
like the Eye of Sauron got thing going
on in the background like closed-cell
foam it does yeah it's it's very and I
think there might be a picture in
Surgical of a Lisa sue the AMD CEO
holding it at her side
so Lisa sue for scale everyone it's a
large box this is the largest CPU box I
ever seen she's actually close to 8 feet
tall so it is smaller than you might fun
fact Lisa sue used to be a MMA champion
fighter but that was after that was
after she quit the NBA she's a she she
was second in line to play Brienne of
Tarth behind Gwendoline Christie yes
yeah thrones yep yep she actually she
makes a cameo at the in the last in the
last episode of Game of Thrones that
that I've heard recent kills Brienne
dark what spoilers yeah Gary
obviously goes to the fact I do
statements we've made a we've just said
have been made up but hey look at this
another party we're gonna be we're gonna
be we're gonna be debating we'll be
debating this design for the retail box
of the thread Ripper processors on
behalf of the show yes we well it's
gonna be glorious well so for now gaze
upon its Wonder and Wonder it looks like
an old TV and wonder how you open it up
and get inside I can tell there's
already like some don't be spoiling it
looks like the just comes a little
where's the guides you can see how the
foam is cut into pieces so this is the
amount of show prep we do get the show
prep we do is like live during the show
yeah way we do that right so an actor
surprise all right last article here
Intel Core i 979 20 X this is the 12
core behemoth 24 thread this was part
from the high-end desktop platform from
in PAL this is the one that has not been
released one of the four CPUs I believe
that has not been released yet in the X
series only six cores short of the one
that they announced in June at Computex
indeed 6 cores sure we're like really
you're having 18 core CPUs right now
they're actually filling up to 10 right
now yeah we haven't worked W rest about
we said 18 yeah all right so now they
have 12 cores
yes core here which immediately wants to
makes you want to position this against
the 1920 X from AMD the thread referred
1920 X which is also a 12 core 24 thread
part so you kind of have these two
seemingly equivalent CPUs there you go
with a boost up to 4.0 gigahertz same as
the 79 20 apparently is also four gears
there's a lot of parallels here except
the the Intel version will actually
retail for quite a bit more $1200 though
around $1200 as opposed to what 800 for
the 1920 X bread Ripper 20x supposed to
be 800 bucks so same core and thread
count pretty much the same boost clock
all around but you have a 400 but one of
them is 400 dollars cheaper AMD's thread
Ripper is 400 sheever of course we're
gonna have to wait till the benchmarks
and stuff come out and we do a review
AMD's also had 20 more PCI Express Lanes
AMD's has 20 more PCI Express Lanes but
here's one downfall to the the 1920 X is
that it is hotter I'm guessing I'm gonna
say it right I'm gonna call right now
580 180 watts EVP versus 140 watt on the
79 20x
so I'm guessing you're gonna need a more
substantial or more robust CPU cooler
for thread Ripper than you will for
this particular maybe himself maybe
liquid cooling maybe liquid cooling
perhaps nose that would be interesting
absolutely but um things are getting
really exciting because we have all this
information it's leaking out by the day
every day we get a little bit more
information about both camps and it just
seems like right now AMD has the better
pricing they have the better pricing and
we know the pricing for the most part we
know the specs but we just don't know
the performance so the question here is
is the 79 20x going to be able to
outperform the is it gonna be is the
performance gonna be worth the $400
premium over the thread Ripper 12 core
equivalent it's hard to say right now of
course but thank you thank you little
thing will be worth it over the 12 over
the 16 core thread Ripper that you
should be able to get for $1000 yeah 200
bucks cheaper than this 12 core part
that's very true and I think I think
what's crazy here is that for the first
time maybe ever
AMD's finally competing with Intel and a
high-end desktop platform because for a
long time for almost a decade
they weren't even competing with Intel
in regards to the mainstream platform
and then Rison finally came along and is
awesome I mean rising just an amazing
alternative for the mainstream but still
AMD didn't really have anything to show
for a high-end platform until now and so
thread refer is a big deal because it
still marks this this huge stepping
stone in a black sea's Competitiveness
last time AMD outside of Opteron not
referring to Opteron here and the the
server side but the last time AMD had a
thousand dollar cpu that was competitive
and beating Intel at the same price was
the FX the original FX series like the
FX 60 and the FX 62 original AMD
dual-core CPUs when they really took
Intel kind of kind of to task in like
2005 2006 2007 and that's what actually
spurred Intel to kick off the tic-tock
update cycle that they started doing
after about 2007-2008 and they kept
doing that for like you know eight ten
years and they kind of like squashed AMD
with it but now AMD is fine
back so yeah cool I think it's good for
everyone it's a fantastic it's crazy to
see how far and ease come now within the
CPU of the mainstream and high-end CPU
desktop market it's very exciting so
well we'll keep a close eye on that
we'll keep a close eye on that Intel
might be in trouble not just in their
mainstream but their high-end desktop
platform as well just one a one final
comment there yeah all intel needs to do
is just revamp their entire pricing
scale yeah there's a crisis I've heard
people say like Oh Intel processors are
 they're not they don't suck
they're not just bad at it right they're
just more expensive than what AMD is now
offering so you can get the same amount
or more performance for less money
there's the good processes they're still
completely functional they're just way
overpriced compared to Andy's so the
question is is Intel going to budge are
they going to be like no we're an
established brand we've been around like
we've been killing we've been crushing
our only competitor for the last 10
years and even at the rates where the
outlandish rates were charging there's
there still going to be a large number
of people that are gonna pay $1200 for
for one of our 12 core CPUs even if
there's a cheaper alternative elsewhere
what will change their mind is just
actual sales sales numbers once the
sales numbers come in right for the for
the third and fourth quarter of this
year
if Intel is really hurting when it comes
to how many processors they're selling
you will start to see you'll see pricing
changes so really it's a matter of like
is Intel hurting enough right now are
they hurting enough as it is to the
point where they're so concerned about
their sales for the their next wave of
core X x-series CPUs that they're going
to drastically lower the prices to be
more competitive with AMD's offerings or
if they're gonna be like no we're still
making hella Bank we don't even we don't
even care if we take a loss on the
enthusiasts grade CPUs that we're
launching we're still gonna charge this
amount our original amount because we
know there there will be some people out
there who buy them still we don't know
we don't know exactly a time will tell
resolve
it's all up in the air people we don't
know anything rumor and speculation
we're all alone in this world all right

don't enable him it makes sense
discourage the Oilers it's an easier way
you're annoying explaining sir which is
K $10 Canadian to make it fair this week
is Kyle's turn since last weekend I
needed to Paul quick question upgrade
GPU memory for Eisen 1070 vs - honey 133
megahertz workstation mostly you guys
are awesome as always upgrade you
remember memory you definitely want fast
memory rise in 3000 is what I aim for or
29:33 you get 3,200 if you can and the
performance especially if you're looking
at gaming scales up with it after that
look at a graphics card yep howdy gamer
10 pounds have either of you used the
Asus tough Z 270 motherboard if so I
have a question
using MDOT to drive but I would like to
know if it will stop me using one of the
slots with the graphics card go etc
holiday gamer you should be okay with
that in the CPUs you know your CB NEC be
put in Z 270 board should be fine yeah
yeah your Z 270 board should I mean Asus
has very sensible designers and so you
should have a direct from the PCH or
direct from the chipset connection for
an MDOT to drive which shouldn't affect
your connectivity for your standard PC
lanes you might want to double-check
that on Asus website but I know Asus
pretty well and that's how they would
design it sensibly there might be a
second one that Mike inflicts but I
don't know the board well enough to say
that off the top of my head I don't
leave IV five dollars building a small
form-factor PC I have an extra 500 gig
Samsung T three USB 3.0 external SSD can
I use it as my OS drive to save money
connected internally via USB 3.0 yes you
can
yeah as long as the USB connection that
you're plugging it into is native in
which case if it's not you might need to
install a driver just like even with the
SATA Drive
but yeah you should be able to do that
all right
checkered tile lol five dollars will you
guys be releasing it Rison three build
soon liquid cooler grow yes and that
makes less sense with horizon three yeah
oh man to be honest yeah if if you're
gonna spend me more than the chip itself
gonna spend the money we spend on liquid
cooling like upgrade your ship you get
to get horizon five or something like
that just not just being honest my
rising three builds already up on ultra
oh yeah you know what else aren't you
cheated I did Holt Hamlet's five butter
declination no God so thanks for the
five bucks
it's got Dilbeck 666 mark of the beast
do you think I would get significant
performance game switching to a 1080
over my crossfire Strix RX 4 80s I gave
in 1440p 444 it's not really an on my 4k
TV not really those are kind of
comparable it would depend on the game
if you have a game of poor scaling then
yes yeah so yeah totally depends on the
game that you're playing yeah games with
good scaling No
yeah so so yeah leave a job maybe ten
dollars I'm still pretty suck too custom
cooling don't know what that means I
don't have much idea what I'm doing with
the a 240g other the ek liquid pool Oh
it'll be done now trying to get it
installed today into the 24-hour pump
run for leaks here beer
Thank You Davy Cheers and yeah I just
watch water cooling videos watch Jace

$10 how will current CP coolers work
with Red River think it's huge it
doesn't seem that current coolers won't
be able to cover the whole thing
no they won't you will need a new cooler
you will not be able to use the same
cooler any of the existing coolers for
thread repair the engine completely new
designs yep right I have a feeling it's
not even the type of thing with it's
like here's a new bracket for your
existing cooler no no no you need a
completely Pacific cooler that that has
more coverage and everything yeah you're
beating all that Rick Sanchez Sanchez
