a rural man I don't know something
snapped off and it's hurting
yikes sorry about that hey you know some
dogs sort of look like their owners the
Pacemakers share the same traits as
their cases that's ridiculous
no it kind of works right I mean because
like the peer-based 600 is cool right
and you're arguably cool right the case
is super quiet and you've always been on
the soft-spoken side yeah see it's
totally true actually there's one more
thing we have in common
what's that well after the colonoscopy I
think I also support a 360 millimeter
radiator that like include push-pull or
the pure bass 604 be quiet offers a
tempered glass side panel sound damping
material and a highly versatile design
chips with a pair of powerful peer rings
two fans and intentional support for 360
radiators click the link in the
description for more info I've gone my
friends welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well today I'm doing a
fun little comparison between two chairs
at completely opposite ends of the
price-point spectrum let's take a look
let's see what we have here today so
first off in one corner we have this
hundred to 120 ish dollar crappy chair
that I got at Staples you can see right
here on Amazon it's going for about one
hundred fifteen hundred and sixteen us
this is pretty much your basic bitch
chair alright we're going to call it BBC
which is what I'll be referring it as in
this video that's not to be confused
with the British broadcaster or anything
else that happens to share the same
acronym nothing comes to mind personally
and in this corner we have our top of
the line high end gaming chair this is
the verdict your trigger 350 that
retails for a whopping $700 nearly seven
times the amount as our BBC over here
and you'll please forgive the rolled up
dollar that I have here I'm just looking
at the price point I was half expecting
this chair to come included with a kilo
of cocaine strapped underneath the seat
but since that's clearly not the case we
can go ahead and remove this now clearly
this is not a racing chair per se
however it is aimed and marketed at
gamers who want to get the utmost
quality flexibility design and comfort
out of their desktops fitting experience
so it's going to be an interesting
comparison because to the untrained eye
if you're just walking by and you saw
these few chairs you might not notice
that one was necessarily worth seven
times the amount as the other so it'll
be an interesting comparison today to
see what you get for your money at
either end of the spectrum so kicking
things off with some design elements
when you're talking about the trigger
350 you're actually working with really
nice DuPont TP EE mesh which is a
high-quality mesh it holds its retention
a lot better than the cheaper stuff
that's found on the BBC for example so
as you sit in this chair for months and
years on end you'll notice that the mesh
actually maintains its shape a lot
better than for example this cheap chair
I mean Heather's only been sitting my
wife has been sitting in this chair for
me too the last few months only and
already you can tell the mesh here on
the seat anyway is just this nasty sort
of loose sagging it's like saggy
foreskin all right saggy foreskin nice
tight foreskin okay super taut all right
it's going to maintain it's sort of
shape over the years and that is what
verdaguer is guaranteeing there's a
10-year warranty behind this chair which
definitely instilled confidence in the
product that being said even with the
basic mesh that you're getting on the
BBC you're still getting much more
breathability and sort of ventilation
than you would with say a solid material
like cold foam or any kind of fabric or
leather that's just straight up you know
I'm completely solid and if you look
over here you can see that the stitching
job on our budget chair is already
starting to come undone I mean it's
pretty low quality here you're getting
staples that are sticking out
potentially poking you if you sit the
wrong way that's not very nice so I mean
it stands to reason that basic bitches
get basic stitches whereas you're not
really seeing that problem over here
with the trigger and granted I've only
been sitting in this chair for a couple
days now and only time will tell how
well the stitching truly holds up but
the idea here is that it's using higher
quality materials and is going to last
you quite a bit longer than the average
basic stuff now one final thing about
the mesh design here is that it can add
a tremendous amount of value for people
who sweat easily like myself I mean I
could sweat up a storm just playing a
video game for an hour straight which is
pretty pathetic but that's just me so if
you're in the same boat having this
additional breathability can really
reduce the amount of body heat that's
trapped in your chair which is going to
help you stay cool now apart from the
mesh the trigger 350 also has these
really nice genuine calfskin leather
accents on the backrest and seat which
looks fantastic in black and they have
this really nice dead
have smell to them and I just absolutely
love it but bear in mind though that
makes this chair not vegan okay and and
if you're talking about someone like my
wife who's a vegetarian at heart but has
some vegan tendencies she's already gone
ahead and rebranded this chair as the
triggered 350 that being said the first
time she sat in it it didn't take long
for her to put her morals aside and
decide that she was going to use this
chair after my review is over so that
being said it is a very nice looking
chair I personally love the leather
accents and I can't think of anything I
love while gaming more than the scent of
dead cow
let's take a look at the backside of
these chairs let's check out that booty
alright so starting with the trigger 350
we've got a full metal body alright from
head to toe there's even a bar on top
where you can mount an optional headrest
if you so choose you can purchase one
from verdaguer where's your head going
to go on the BBC a know where you're
going to rely on your lazy ass neck and
that's a damn shame
alright you get a full plastic body on
the BBC which is not going to hold up to
wear and tear nearly as well as a full
metal frames not only does this give the
350 a distinguished amount of heft but
it just reeks quality I mean it just
reeks it reeks more than the calfskin
leather now considering the low price
point of our BBC here I was surprised to
find any degree of lumbar support at all
but there you have it granted it's just
a hard piece of plastic it does have
height adjustment but it just doesn't
feel all that great alright we'll talk
about comfort more later on the trigger
350 however you actually get a soft
cushiony pillow for your lower back all
right you get a lumbar pillow which is
which feels really nice and it features
height adjustment so you can position it
right into the curve of your lower back
now the trigger 350 you do get some
additional adjustability options that
the BBC and other chairs like it simply
don't have for starters there are
buttons on either side of the backrest
where if you push those in it allows you
to adjust the angle of the backrest this
is something different than reclining it
just simply pops the bottom of it
forward or backward depending on how
straight you want the back piece to be
and that's just going to depend on your
comfort level as a user and your
preference is in your back shape and all
that sort of thing the other function
starts with a button underneath your
chair that's super easy to reach where
if you push that in it allows you to
change the depth of your seat so you can
actually move the seat closer or further
away from the backrest I would I would
suggest moving it closer if you want to
promote more upright posture
and moving it further away if you tend
to slouch a little bit more in your
chair naturally or if you just have a
big old booty now I feel like arm rests
are just as important as lower back
support when it comes to a solid office
chair so starting with the BBC here
we've got sort of a sort of a firm but
soft plastic all right it feels ok it
feels all right when you put your arm
just straight onto it and it's
relatively flat in shape and the edges
the edges all around are more or less
sort of a right angle sort of sharp here
and I have an issue with this because if
you have your forearms either too far
forward or too far back the edges of
these arm rests are going to dig into
your arms and cause quite a bit of
discomfort without much time going by
and that's not good now compare that to
the rounded shape of the trigger 350 arm
rest all right not only are you getting
sort of a more bowed sort of shape on
top but the edges are also rounded so
when you put your arm too far forward or
back it does not dig into your forearm
and it doesn't cause any sort of
discomfort it's extremely extremely
comfortable compared to the BBC the arm
rests on the BBC features six level
height adjustment there's a little latch
that you can pull to kind of go up
increment at a time it works fairly well
they've even printed numbers on the
inside of the armrest so you can really
easily tell that both arm rests are
level now I hate to say it but the
height adjustment on the arm rests for
the trigger 350 are not quite as
convenient going up there's no problem
if you want to increase the height you
just simply pull it up there's no switch
or lever or latch that you need to hold
in while you do it but if you want to go
down you can't just go down one notch
let's say you went up too high you can't
just go down you have to go all the way
up and that will release the armrests
allow you to reset it all the way back
to the bottom and then from there you
can try again and go back up in
increments there our indicator lines on
the outside of the armrest but they're
not labeled so it's kind of a hassle to
have to count them up just to make sure
that your armrests are sitting at the
same height level that being said this
is more of a set at once and forget it
type of affair so it's probably not
going to be a problem for most people
now I probably should have mentioned
this at the beginning of the video but
whatever is that this chair gets its
name from the fact that it uses around
350 individual components to make up its
structure and two of those components
are these triggers found directly
underneath the armrest for easy and
convenient access these triggers control
the two most basic and frequently used
functions
of any office chair which is seat height
adjustment and the reclining of the
backrest
the benefit of having these triggers
underneath the armrests should be pretty
obvious guys I mean this way you don't
have to fiddle around blindly with some
sort of lever underneath your chair to
make these adjustments instead you
barely have to move your arm and within
one second probably you can already be
making these adjustments on the fly
super quickly and easily the trigger on
the right adjust the seat height
adjustment and there's a fairly nice
range there so whether you're you know
Kyle fun-sized or you know fractal Josh
sighs you should be well accommodated
with the trigger 350 pulling the left
trigger allows you to recline the
backrest so far back in fact that you
would almost need that optional headrest
if you didn't want your head to just
sort of dangle off the edge of the chair
now when the backrest is allowed for
free movement one of my favorite
features about this chair is that you
can adjust the amount of resistance or
pressure that's required to push the
backrest back and that can be adjusted
by this low crank here underneath the
chair it's just a crank that turns very
easily it's super accessible and that
will allow you to either increase or
decrease the amount of pressure required
to get that backrest back so some people
prefer a firmer resistance like myself
other people just want to barely lightly
tap the backrest and have it fold down
all the way regardless of your
preference it's just super nice to be
able to manually adjust that setting oh
hey BBC I almost forgot about you look
at these nasty-ass levers get the
out of here at the bottom of your
trigger 350 you'll find an aluminum
alloy five star base it's super sturdy
I'd give it a five out of five myself
and it could probably even probably beat
someone to death with it which is always
a good benchmark for how sturdy
something is then you've also got these
nice wheels these are some nice roller
ball bearing wheels alright you get five
of them obviously metal and plastic
construction they're really tailored for
either carpet or hardwood floor but they
really shine on hardwood from what I've
been told I don't personally have any
hardwood in my floor because I'm a poor
person but they're supposed to be
incredibly quiet on a hardwood floor and
they're supposed to glide incredibly
well also so that's going to be a far
superior than these cheapo casters on
the BBC which these are noisy as hell on
a flat surface granted they do roll a
bit nicer on carpet I will say that the
trigger 350 at least with these wheels
the non special edition these are a
little bit stiff on carpet so you might
want to consider getting the plastic
desk mat
if you're going to be using this chair
in a carpeted environment that being
said the special edition of the trigger
350 does already include some nicer
wheels they're slightly better at at
gliding I believe and they also have a
more improved bearing design and I
believe you can also purchase those
wheels a la carte if you wanted to
upgrade your your non special edition
trigger 350 now arguably the most
important thing that people look out for
when purchasing a new desk chair is how
comfortable it is
the comfort level is really a top
priority for most people and this is
also one of the most difficult things to
sort of describe in a review like this
simply because it's entirely subjective
I can tell you all the specs and little
features about these chairs but the
comfort level is going to differ from
person to person for me personally I
like the trigger 350 a lot it's
incredibly comfy particularly the lower
back and the armrest that just does it
for me wifey sauce agrees this is way
more comfortable than the the BBC over
here and really when you sit in the BBC
for the first time in the first 20
seconds in a bed for a hundred and
twenty bucks you're like well it's not
that much less comfortable than the
trigger 350 to warrant you know seven
times the price amount it's when you're
sitting in these chairs for three-plus
hours guys if you're if you're in your
desk chair for 20 minutes at a time and
that's it then get this one get the BBC
and save a crap ton of money but if
you're if you're if you're used to doing
longer gaming sessions or just longer
work sessions then that's when you're
really going to notice how much more
comfortable this is and how much more
support there is for your lower back in
particular with that nice little pillow
there it's just more ergonomic in every
way and the fact that you can sort of
tailor this chair there's more
customizability options to really fit it
to your body makes this overall a much
more enjoyable sitting experience in the
long run the fact of the matter here is
that this is a fantastic product the
trigger 350 is incredibly comfortable
regardless of your body shape or size
okay the one gripe that I have the main
gripe apart from the little nitpicks
about the armrest height adjustment is
that the price is a bit overwhelming
okay and especially this wouldn't even
be such an issue if it wasn't targeted
at gamers because most gamers correct me
if I'm wrong guys would rather take
their $700 and spend it on a high-end
processor or a graphics card then dump
it into a chair as important as chairs
are even more so
your health and your posture in the long
run of things a chair is a better
investment than a graphics card you
replace your graphics card a couple
years down the line that being said
that's just not where the gamers
mentality is right now we're going to
take that money elsewhere and they're
probably going to end up buying a chair
that's somewhere between pretty crappy
BBC and super high-end trigger 350
they're probably going to go right in
the middle maybe spend three to five
hundred dollars on chair instead of one
or the other of these extremes so to be
perfectly clear I am giving this chair
my full 100% recommendation at the same
time it feels weird for me to tell all
of you guys at home to go out and buy
one of these chairs immediately when I
know deep down that most of us probably
can't afford it so that's the sort of
internal struggle that I'm dealing with
right now and maybe you guys can help
shed some light of your own in the
comments below is this too much to pay
for a gaming chair is it worth $700 if
not what's the most you'd be willing to
fork out for a chair that's going to
last you potentially 10 plus years
always curious to hear your thoughts in
