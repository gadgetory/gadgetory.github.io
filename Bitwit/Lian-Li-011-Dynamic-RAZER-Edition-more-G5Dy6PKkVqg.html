brought to you by fantex berta gear
enter max be quiet and cable Mott you
can learn more about their products and
the links below what's going on guys
Calvin wood here covering Computex 2018
we're at the Lindley Suites and we're
checking out cases they have a lot of
cool new cases here speaking of cool
this is the land cool one it's a $99
case or I guess 99 or $89 depending on
whether you want RGB or USB 3.1 gen2
type-c which we're definitely starting
to see a lot more of at the event here
taking a look at the front panel it's
it's kind of got this monolithic design
its kind of foreboding but it looks kind
of cool at the same time and they use a
CNC mill to sort of each out the the
front panel here just to give it a more
premium feel and it definitely looks and
feels like a premium case even though it
is technically sub $100 this is the I
believe this is the non RGB version
don't quote me on that it's it's not
really built out or anything so it's
hard to tell you do get tempered glass
on the side which is sort of two lists
there's two captive thumb screws in the
back and it allows you to slide off very
easily
oh that felt good I felt really good I'm
gonna put this a tempered glass panel
down for a second here and take a look
at the interior here they've really
optimized it for versatility you can use
this case for air cooling you can pop in
some radiators I believe we have three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator at
the at the front and a two eighty at the
top don't quote me on whether or not
those can be installed simultaneously
but definitely some cooling potential
here also the power supply basement
looks very nice it's kind of got this
sort of flat edge at the corner you've
got some SSD mounts on the top of the
power supply shroud you can actually
mount two two and a half inch drives or
if you want you can pop them off like so
and voila you get some ventilation for
power supply and whatnot also fan mounts
you can do two 120 millimeter fan mounts
our fans I should say right here which
is a great idea honestly I think you
could even maybe fit a radiator actually
it looks like the fan the fan mounts
maybe are too far apart for a radiator
but I'm sure you could someone's
probably gonna mod this in order to fit
a 240 millimeter rad right there so
that's pretty cool you get one two three
four five six seven expansion slots
there's also two vertical for vertical
mounted GPUs I don't believe a riser
cable
included as is the case with most cases
large CPU cooler cut out pre-installed
standoffs and plenty of plenty of the
plenty of room for activities honestly
at the top here you get a removable dust
filter that is magnetic completely
tooless you can sort of see the flexible
mounting strips right there everything
is pretty well thought-out for a semi
budget case the back is pretty
bare-bones nothing too much going on
here let's take a closer look on the
other side you get these two thumb
screws I guess they're kind of they're
kind of thumb screws yeah they're thumb
screws and then it's got sort of a nice
feel to it a nice weight to it on the
back it's it's pretty straightforward
nothing too much going on here look like
an LED controller with the USB 3 I
should mention two trays for two and a
half inch drives which can be mounted
right here to the left or you can
actually place them right here behind
the motherboard itself that way you can
open up the left channel for more cable
routing there's also a hard drive cage
I believe it looks like two three and a
half inch drives right down there the
whole cage itself can be slid towards
the power supply to open up more room
for front mounted radiators or you can
leave it in its current configuration
for length of your power supplies and I
just want to point out one more time
that this case does feature USB type-c
and it's only $99 now case vendors
really don't have an excuse for their
one hundred and fifty plus dollar case
to not have type C on the front panel
let's see if I remember how to do this
oh that's this is probably one of the
easiest mounting solutions for a
tempered glass side panel that I've seen
on the case ever like that just just
slid on so easily alright let's see what
else they have
so the 0:11 dynamic has been a very well
received case from the community so far
and now they have made it even cooler by
partnering up with razer to deliver this
sort of one-of-a-kind amazing showpiece
case you can see they've got like the
Razer logo at the front they got
addressable RGB lining the front and the
bottom sort of an under glow if you will
all together it's it's just kind of got
this really unique flair to it that I
don't know it just demands attention
it's an attention whore case that's
we'll call it still all the same great
functionality built in as the original 0
11 dynamic but just with that extra
razor panache that's that's not a word
but pizzettes cuz that's that's that's
what I went to say over here we have the
zero eleven err RGB taking a lot of
similar design language and other
features from the zero eleven dynamic
but with sort of an RGB flair to it
there's actually two sort of mounts here
for eighty millimeter fans that's kind
of a neat addition if you as long as you
get you know quiet ones that are that
aren't super whiney and then at the
bottom here you've got some SSD mounting
points that's kind of cool
plenty of ventilation for additional
airflow air intake there's also a
bracket sold separately if you wanted to
do a vertical GPU mount you can see
we've got a asus strix card in here
right now that's sitting pretty doesn't
doesn't really look like it's under load
though there's also three included of
there they also have three included 120
millimeter bora RGB fans which adds just
a nice touch and some illumination to
the interior as far as radiator support
you can do up to a 360 at the top or a
280 at the front I believe as they were
saying depending on your water cooling
skill level you might even be able to
cram some additional radiator into this
case if you get creative enough the
reason I like this case almost just as
much if not more than the zero eleven
dynamic is really the front panel how
it's really just tailored for
performance and air flows it maybe
doesn't look quite as clean or pretty as
the dynamic but holy moly it's just
straight mesh at the front obviously
there's this plastic grille just for
aesthetic purposes but just behind that
is pretty much just full mesh material
so all together it looks like you're
going to be probably cleaning this out
as far as dust filtration quite
regularly but your thermals will
definitely be improved over the 0:11
dynamic and as far as front panel goes
you get a light up the power button I
would assume that's RGB 2 USB 3 mic and
headphone and of course USB 3.1 gen2
type-c now if you don't really care
about RGB then there's also the 0:11 air
just drop the RGB entirely which will
cost you a little bit less money and
probably not light up nearly as much
however that doesn't mean it's just as
versatile the internal layout is more or
less the same and you've got this
beautiful case or the system if they put
together showing you just how many fans
you can get loaded inside of this thing
they have 12 120 millimeter fans if
you're if you're a fan whore
then this is the perfect case for you
and look at look at that strimmer RGB
cable look at that oh there's those fans
there those 80 millimeter fans just
chilling back there although one of them
seems to be sleeping at the moment
that's okay I won't tell the Lele staff
all right so you guys probably remember
the streamer video that I did recently
the first RGB cable to hit store shelves
even though it hasn't really hit store
shelves yet but it's going to very soon
probably in the next month or two but
they've actually made some some much
needed adjustments already to the
prototype that I showed you guys earlier
for instance they've kind of reinforced
the the cable here and again this is by
no means a final product but the cable
that broke on us when we did our video
has actually been reinforced in such a
way where the PCB that's underneath here
has actually been sort of shortened or
moved back a bit that the soldering
points are more central and not so close
to the edge therefore it's not just it's
not quite as fragile it's a bit stronger
just just by Nature another change that
I noticed here is that there are no more
screws on the side of these custom cable
combs these these custom cable combs
that sort of hold the fiber-optic wires
to the cables themselves I think it just
provides a much cleaner look and it also
feels way more secure when you're
sliding the combs from left to right or
whichever which way the other thing that
Lindley mentioned is that they're
planning to potentially sell this as a
standalone DIY kit where you could just
buy the fiber-optic separately and
attach it or modify it on to your
existing power cable that way you don't
have to buy a completely new set and
they'll be able to lower the costs I did
ask them about pricing a lot of you guys
were sort of blowing me up about that in
the comments of my last video and
they're talking anywhere between 35 to
50 dollars for the fully included 24 pin
ATX cable that would include the power
cable as well you guys let me know what
you think of that price I'm sure 35
sounds a lot better to you guys than 50
as it does to me too but that's this
that's the new and
strimmer for now and again they're gonna
be making further iterations before the
final release so you guys remember how
lien Li was sort of one of the first to
come to market with a case table that
was sort of a had an up-and-down feature
that you could actually build your
system inside of a desk it was glorious
but also very large and expensive so
what they've done with this product is
they've shrunk it down to be a more
manageable size because not everybody
lives in a mansion and they've also made
it cheaper and I put cheaper in
quotations because this is still gonna
run you about nine hundred and ninety
nine US dollars but hey you're getting a
desk and a premium computer case all
wrapped into one I guess you could also
probably double this as a heater
depending on which way you're facing the
back of the desk because that's where
all the exhaust would take place they
actually have three fans on a radiator
here that are set to exhaust but I've
been told that that's just for showpiece
purposes and ideally you'd want to flip
those fans around as intake and again
the exhaust out the back altogether it's
a very nice desk they've actually sort
of shortened the thickness of it all so
that it doesn't really interfere with
your legs as you're using it which is
always appreciated
and we're still getting the up and down
feature premium premium vertical desks
like these without the case without the
PC DIY element are already expensive to
begin with so this is just I don't know
this is this is one of the nicer tables
that I've ever seen I guess it's a desk
on the table this is one of the nicer
desks I've ever seen they've also
brought back the whole up-and-down
aspect here I'm actually controlling it
with a little little controller over
here it's it could be a standing desk or
a sitting desk so you know if you like
gaming standing up you could very well
do that and these vertical desks even
without the PC DIY element are pretty
expensive these days so the fact that
you're getting all this for $9.99 might
might actually sound somewhat reasonable
but you guys let me know what you think
about all this stuff that's going to
conclude it for my time here at the Leon
Lee's suite at Computex 2018 thank you
