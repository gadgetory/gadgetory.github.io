below what's going on guys welcome back
to the channel hope you're all doing
well this is part three of the n to
elite build and if all goes smoothly we
may very well get a first boot so I'm
super excited there's a couple things on
the agenda actually a lot of things that
we have left to do first of which is
mounting the water block to our second
GPU we finally got in that second GTX
1080i Strix OSI model from Asus thank
God it's here
we can finally slap on the glacier
series water block from fan techs and
pop that into the system so that we can
continue our to bending last time in
part two we actually finished up the CPU
loop it's looking great so far but we
still have got to do the GPU loop so
we'll be doing all the runs for that
followed by installing the second two
terabyte 960 Pro from Samsung this is m2
nvme Drive so now we have two of them
that we're gonna be raid 0 II together
for a whopping 4 terabytes and the the
amount of throughput on this is gonna be
absolutely insane we'll be mounting it
to the bin to slot as part of the
rampage 6 Xtreme in there and very
excited to actually have this as a
storage solution for this ridiculously
overkill build now as you guys are
probably aware by now we are using a
bunch of ll series RGB fans from Corsair
inside of the system so we're gonna need
a way to wire those up to these
commander pro's ought to be installing
these at some point later today just so
we can take full advantage of all the
customizing options with these insane
fans now in part two I had not yet
decided which fluid I'd be using for
this system all I knew is that it would
have to be something special so I
eventually decided on the Primo chill
view this is after year a lot of your
guys's suggestions and and my own sort
of interest I had seen guys like Jays
$0.02 been using it and speaking very
highly of it and it just looks awesome
I mean when you shake it and stuff
whenever it's in motion it has a sort of
marbled shampoo like look to it and it
just has an amazing appearance that I
think is really gonna shine in this
system I got the silver color I was
really
for white I think that would have
reflected the lighting in here a lot
better but primo chill didn't have any
white on hand I think they were being
held up for some reason on that and so
silver is what we got I'm hoping it
turns out good if not we can always
change it out later down the line but
I'm very excited to be using it in this
system today nonetheless and then
finally last but not least we have some
premium sleeved cables from the folks
over at n sourced actually Joey from n
source did a fantastic job I gave him a
little bit of guidance just sort of a
few hints of what I wanted I didn't
really know exactly what he would turn
out with but I'm really digging the
color scheme and sort of patterned that
he that he ended up choosing because it
just looks fantastic and it's gonna look
even better once it's all installed so
that's pretty much what's on the agenda
for today ladies and gentlemen overall I
am super excited to finally see this
thing through and hopefully by the end
of this video we'll get a first boot I
can't wait any longer so without further
ado let's dive right in and finish this
build
wait aren't you forgetting something
Kyle
you
well guys we actually did it
we built or I guess I built the most
high-end system that I think you could
possibly build here in 2017 with the
exception of maybe cranking up the the
GPUs to some $3,000 Titan v's or
something like that but holy crap I am
pretty surprised with myself that I was
able to pull this off this looks like it
could be on the show floor at CES or
Computex or something like that so I'm
I'm super humbled that I was able to
pull this off I guess it just goes to
show that if you put your mind to
something and you're willing to put in
the time and effort you can't achieve
anything but we are far from finished
people we still have to test this beast
and see how she games and renders and
everything else that you can possibly
throw at it
we'll also be doing some overclocking on
both the CPU and GPUs and taking a look
at thermals of course acoustics it's
really loud right now because obviously
I haven't configured the fans or
anything like that but still much more
to come guys so thank you for making for
helping make this possible be sure to
subscribe to the channel for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon
go ahead and toss a like on this video

finally if you guys want to watch my
videos a week early without ads you can
check me out on on floatplane it's three
bucks a month to sign up I highly
encourage all of you to at least check

is super sexy speaking of sexy did you
honestly think I would end this video
without a super sexy montage of this
beautiful beast that lies before you if
you did you don't know me at all and I
am ashamed I'm ashamed of you actually I
forgive you now I'm a very quick
forgiver lucky for you so guys from the
bottom of my heart one final thank you

encouragement throughout the entire
procedure and process of putting this
thing together you guys deserve it

hardware porn yeah I guess that's pretty
accurate okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
