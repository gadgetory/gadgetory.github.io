video and they've employed me to say
nothing but kind and pleasant things
about their new delta r gb SSD and
that's exactly what I'm here to do today
no legitimately sponsored by T force I
want that to be very transparent that's
why I'm getting it out now but we're
gonna take an objective look at this
drive this is not a review we've never
done never have never will do paid
reviews on this channel it's just not
how we operate
so rather consider this more of a first
look slash overview we're gonna take a
look at the main highlights and features
of this drive we're gonna plug it in to
make sure that it's performing as
advertised and finally take a look at
the RGB goodness that it has to offer
because let's face it if you're buying
this drive specifically you probably
mainly care about how it looks and
there's absolutely nothing wrong with
that I do it myself all the time if you
happen to have some deep inner hatred
for RGB maybe you were hurt by a triplet
of LEDs as a child then you shouldn't
have clicked on this video
speaking of which taking a look at the
box here you can see we've got our
choice of either a white or black model
of course the box only includes one or
the other you can also tell that these
are two and a half inch drives there's
SATA based so SATA rev3 six gigabit per
second SSDs and you're getting speeds
that reflect that protocol so anywhere
from 560 megabytes per second sequential
reads to 510 megabytes per second
sequential writes is what can be
expected with these drives I believe
it's more like 500 megabytes per second
sequential writes if it's the 250 gig or
500 gig version and you get 510 when
stepping up to the one terabyte just to
clarify and now for the fastest unboxing
ever recorded ready and go come on
alright what we got done hahaha and of
course someone in the comments is gonna
be like me actually the world's fastest
in Meg's in 20 seconds buddy man name
yeah shut up so here's a look you can
see we've got the white model here I've
actually already unboxed the black model
I'll put it next to it for comparison
for a moment there you go
you can see that it's it's definitely
not your typical SSD in terms of
aesthetics it's got a lot of flair to
it's got a very stylized design which
probably isn't for everyone but I think
when paired with the right case and the
right components I think it could look
really good in the proper system I'll
put the black one aside for now one of
the first things you notice about this
drive is just how large the RGB area is
that's the sort of semi-transparent
space in the middle here as well as a
bit of top tee forces actually priding
themselves on having the largest RGB
area for any SSD currently on the market
so if you're just trying to cram in as
much illumination into your system as
possible this might be the SSD you're
looking for now something to bear in
mind is that if you're mounting this
drive in your case landscape rather than
portrait because portrait doesn't really
matter how its oriented but if you're
mounting it landscape into your system
bear in mind of the connectors are on
the left side of the drive and so
whatever cables do routing are gonna
need to be able to access it easily from
that side if you want to access from the
right side you would have to flip the
drive upside down and at that point you
can see all the logos and text and stuff
would actually be inverted and that
doesn't look all that great so keep that
in mind of course you've got your
standards say the power and data
connectors as well as microUSB and
that's how this drive gets connected to
your motherboard so you've got micro USB
with this included cable on one end and
two connector options on the other one
being a three pin 5 volt addressable RGB
connector so again that's three pin one
of those pins is actually filled up so
it will not work with your with your
four pin RGB header it's got to be a
three pin and then your other connector
is just a smaller three pin that's got
your DV and G most motherboards will
feature one or the other of these
connectors very few of them will feature
both at this point it probably also goes
without saying that you can sync up the
lighting on this drive with the lighting
on your motherboard using apps like asus
or a sink and a scientistic light
gigabyte RGB fusion and so forth so with
that said I think it's time that we hook
this guy up for a quick little speed
test just want to make sure that we're
getting the advertised performance here
and then we'll wrap things up finally
with that obligatory RGB demo all right
we've got crystal disk mark open now
this is the application that T force as
well as a lot of SSD manufacturers like
to use in order to display their
sequential read/write speeds and just to
verify here we've got a clean drive as
zero gigs used of it's 233 gig capacity
and let's go ahead and run it all right
so our read tests have just come in and
it's looking pretty good actually
queued up 32 we're getting 564 megabytes
per second thereabouts which is just
slightly higher than the advertised
speeds on the box that's actually pretty
good let's see how we do on the writes
alright so it looks like we're getting
about 510 megabytes per second
sequential writes at cue def 32 right on
the money actually slightly higher than
what was advertised so this is great
this is right in line with what you
would expect from a SATA rev3 6 gigabit
per second drive on that note let's wrap
this up with a quick RGB demo there's
not much else to say here go ahead sit
back relax and enjoy the show
all righty so this has been the T force
delta r gb SSD I'm holding guns this is
fun I'm gonna hold it like this for the
rest of the video I just took a gander
at the pricing to see what they were
going for an Amazon didn't find the
white one but the black one was going
for 85 bucks u.s. for the 250 gig models
so that's actually not too shabby since
especially since you're getting that GB
goodness on that but you guys let me
know what you think of these things I'll
put links for these in the description
below as always thank you so much for
watching this video toss a like on it if
you enjoyed it and get subscribed for
more tech stuff right around the corner
you can also check me out on floatplane
if you want to watch my videos for 3
bucks a month but out adds a whole week
early I'll put a link for that in the
video description thanks again for
watching have a good one and I'll see
y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
