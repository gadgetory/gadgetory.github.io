YouTube at this point very much so
assuming that's the case welcome
everyone to awesome hardware episode 105
this is side a which is right now live
on my channel if you're watching this on
YouTube and after this side you should
go hop over to Paul's half of the show
on his channel that's youtube.com slash
Paul's Hardware where we'll be
continuing another hour or so of this
magnificent broadcast gonna be great
those of you watching us on Twitch just
stay where you are we do everything to
twitch live there's really no cuts there
so nothing to worry about but this is a
show that Paul and I do every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific and we're
very glad that you are joining us today
as you watch us talk about tech news and
drink beer that's that's more or less
what we do on this show speaking of
speaking of beer we have we have some
little suddenly a little something here
this is from Lagunitas Brewing Company
one of my favorite beers by them Paul is
about to open his glass he almost opened
your glass there oh I was a good cop
that was a good lighter open hey I
grabbed the wrong opening it's okay it's
kind of sacrilegious that I'm drinking
this beer out of a downtown Brown glass
but why is that sacrilegious because
it's a good class there's not as good
glass I just feel wrong for making it
different on a beer and drink one good
beer while thinking fondly of another
good beer
it just seems it just seems wrong okay I
feel bad you know it seems wrong is that
we don't have coasters we definitely
should have those on this very nice
wooden table to eat this there we go
all right so cheers to all here's who
might be drinking along with us
assuming you're legal drinking age and
if not then you should we get older yep
hurry up
hurry up and get old um alright let's
talk about ourselves for a bit
good idea we are selling things on our
stores as usual my stores bit wit tech
slash store you can find the link in my
youtube description I'm selling hoodies
now the hoodies are back in stock the
glasses are back in stock actually the
hoodies look pretty nice they run a
little bit small so be warned if you're
a medium then maybe go for a large and
so forth just just let you guys know the
glasses
one size fits all so that's nice they
are now an apple they're available now
in 20 ounce capacity so basically the
same as as Paul's glasses which he also
sells on his store pause hardware net
now with enhanced girth
now enhance skirt on that and my glasses
are here his glasses are there if you
purchase something from both of our
stores at around the same time with the
same day or something you get a small
kickback it will be refunded to you
automatically on shipping you get a
small savings on shipping there which
our guy in Vermont who handles all of
our logistics will take care of for you
you'll also get a Johnson shout out if
you happen to them up it's um it's it's
wrong and dirty it's always a highlight
but you guys love it as far as donations
in chat and YouTube chat go ahead and
donate all the monies whatever message
that you attach to those donations will
be read at the end of each half of the
show that they appeared on right that's
how that's usually how it worked that's
how we do it so I'm ask your questions
or you don't have to attach anything you
could just like money as long as we
remember we're okay with that too um
alright let's talk about our first
segment which is hot and heavy hardware
I've just gathered up I've rounded up a
couple notable mentions here in the
hardware department starting with the
Acer predator z2 7i UV okay this is not
that's not to be confused with the x27
that everyone has been raging about ever
since it was announced at the Acer press
event a week or two ago this one
deserves some attention I think
definitely hasn't been receiving as much
attention as the x27 but this is a more
I would say wallet friendly according to
the article uh we don't know if it's
more wallet friendly because we don't
know the price yet I would imagine it's
still a pretty penny but there are a few
features that have been dropped off of
the X 27 to make this a tad more
inexpensive for the average gamer now
you don't get 4k that's one of the
features you get 2560 by 1440 instead
and there's also the absence of HDR
which you know it kind of lowers the
premium on it a bit I'm sure it still
does have a very nice curve though an
1800 our curve to be a bit more
immersive and draw you into the game it
is how
ever etienne panel ah yeah so at first I
was like oh boo but it does use a
quantum dot film in order to support 130
percent of the srgb and 95% of the DCI
p3 color gamut Slyke so let's just take
on a pig yes basically take tian mian
slap some quantum dots on it and call it
it good
monitor good decent color at every
spectrum um I don't know I'd have to see
why these in person to know how
effective that was a color range again
somehow 30% of srgb and 95% of the DCI
p3 so I I don't know if that's the same
as I don't know that's a sixteen point
seven million
display colors so it's 8-bit so it's an
8-bit TN panel so I mean you're not
gonna get really good color depth out of
this monitor right but you'll get 2560
by 1440 and I get hundred and forty-four
Hertz hundred forty-four Hertz native
can be overclocked at 165 oh I'm not
sure if many people will notice the
difference but if you're like a super
competitive gamer professional player
then maybe that makes missus I missed it
does this have G sync it does have Jason
can you sink and ultra low motion blur I
was getting around with that and Toby
eye-tracking hardware so um we're
familiar with this old and old at all
this homie pollen I had a chance to
check this out at CES last year I
believe or was this year no last year
and it's pretty cool I think I was
playing Assassin's Creed unity or
something like that and I was like being
able to like jump from building the
building without ever using the mouse or
keyboard that was kind of cool just
using your eyes and this is built this
technology is built into the monitor and
it supports already 100 titles support
Toby eye tracking which I had no idea
that it was already so widespread that's
crazy um sure to grow I'm sure and
there's no price or availability
mentioned for this panel just yet but
again I'm sure it's not going to be
super cheap but at least cheaper than
the x27
and you still get some pretty cool specs
apart from two yet what that alright
that damn it moving on to our next piece
of hardware here it's the Corsair
RGB clave or glaive RGB ya glai but
maybe it's a gaming mouse with 16 no 16
programmable buttons would be a little
insane 6 programmable buttons and a dpi
69,000 16 programmable button like yeah
MMO mice of course yeah but just looking
at the picture you wouldn't think the
headsets true that'd be a little is like
weird way to go they've all of these all
these little dots of air buttons yep
have to be very precise indeed
Omron switches it features our on
switches for the left and right clicks
those are pretty durable it's like 50
million clicks of endurance and you get
to RGB of course with several customized
zones hey Adam hey Adam sorry we're
streaming Adam Adam Adam I can't hear
you just want your pictures Adam you can
stop talking at them customizable zones
that are RGB back 'lets supports custom
profiles and can be gained specific the
USB refresh rate is thousand megahertz
one millisecond and they're there
including three interchangeable magnetic
grapes so if you have a preference on
how you like the side to be what perfect
times smooth or bumpy that one has like
an elongated thumb pad or a thumb thumb
area I love my thumb pads elongated you
doing you know me I do you uh so sensual
and fall with his along with them a wide
grip with your your thumb rest and $70
us seventy bucks I would have to
probably that's not terrible the mouse
myself just to feel some sort of quality
it looks pretty more or less quality
enough and seems like it has a couple
decent features um a lot of a lot of
more aesthetic features I guess than the
pure function but go for the reviews
took them out on this guy there a bear
there there are several reviews out on
this arity i have already named them
there's video reviews I'm even pretty uh
pretty well received during Frank might
a dental and actually made a creepy yeah
I've always liked touranment when you
get the little add-on pieces like little
pop off thumb rest and stuff with mice
because I was like you know you're going
to find one that you like and never you
know the other day to use so it's good
to have the option but then I'm always
like put them the others become useless
sort of like I
never met anyone who switches between
like four different gaming no like I'm
gonna edit a now go to my fps you know I
need to switch my my thumb rest out for
maximum whatever yeah it is a tad
gimmicky I would say I don't know there
might be somebody out there who who
enjoyed it moving on to our next piece
which is a the asus zenui
mb 16 AC this is a 15.6 inch USB monitor
that's lighting pretty soon sorry sorry
I just wanted to prove those right yeah
Frank I Frank did did review the clave
you guys so that half of you just hit
half a mil hey that's half a million you
didn't you congratulate him I have not
won on twitter twitter the my Twitter
feed I use Twitter anymore yeah that's a
bad Twitter well congratulations Frank
if you're watching this congrats on half
a million that's awesome is very very
super very sharp
super damn clean so yeah check out
Frank's review of the glaive if you guys
wanna look like things like Loki team
crispy hey alright so um moving on to
the Zen screen from Asus
oh no this this sort of excites me and
stimulates me this was revealed at IFA
2016 last August so it's been a while
since we've heard anything about this
panel pop-up but it's a portable sixteen
point six inch IPS display 1920 by 1080
that uses USB 3 either type A or type C
to make a connection to your computer or
laptop if you wanted to extend your
display it's super thin at 8 millimeters
and it weighs only 780 grams it includes
a one milliliter foldable case providing
protection and also offers sort of a the
ability to stand horizontally or
vertically as they show you right there
that's really cool that you can stand it
vertically like um you don't really see
that too much on these portable displays
it looks really nice I will say that and
I believe it has a built-in speaker I
don't know if you'd ever want to use it
but it could be handy in some situations
response time was not listed so even
though it has like a built-in gaming
mode that you can switch to I'm not
exactly sure what the response time is
because I feel like for these types of
external displays or these um add-on
displays the portable ones don't
generally gain very well because the
response time is
relatively high yeah specially when
their IPs of course color depth is great
but response time you get a lot of
blurriness when you're in a fast-paced
situation while gaming so it wasn't
listed in the specs sheet right there
but um I would I would really just
something like this for gaming but no
more like for business use or for like
editing on the go or something like that
right it's awesome for that kind of
thing but it would be cool if it did
offer some some gaming advantages there
gaming features but there you go
it definitely great this is my companion
on the move in the commercialisation
this person at the top of a mountain
like it exit I'm to the top of the man
what is he doing Highland carrying my
screen is he trying to make a world
rekky is the single example of when
someone has done this on top of him
mm-hmm I kind of want one they should
just use clips of us wait so is there
any price how about $300 I am was the
rumored or the suggested price but that
was last year in 2016
August I would imagine it's still around
that same price $300 is about what you
would pay for an external external
monitor with these specs
okay that's fairly um believe it or not
fairly reasonable thank you I have one
from G chic that was like 350 bucks G
chic and it's about the same you know
1080p IPS 15.6 inch so my wife got one
for like 70 bucks but it was a low
resolution one it was like you know
I don't even know like 700 by 1300 or
whatever that weird resolution ever you
brought it to land syndicate yeah I mean
it as functional as as with you know if
you just need a bit of extra screen
space sure on the go yeah definitely
makes a nice companion matter oh I
should also mention that it gets all of
its power through the the USB cable so
you don't have any like batteries that
you have to recharge or swap out which
is nice
moving on to the Corsair Carbide series
spec not the Alpha the spec 0 4 and
looks very very similar in style to the
spec alpha just has those really sharp
modern bold angular edges oh come on get
with it all sorry the doctors checking
me that's ok um so this is a pretty cool
case it's got a ATX support and very
stylish ATX support meaning for the
motherboard and the PSU and it supports
three hard drives up to two SSDs it's
got a side IO
which I always feel conflicted about I
feel like the side IO is great if I was
facing you and really in communitive
it's not efforts in the wrong side
against the wall or something
it's got cable routing cutouts and
tie-downs cable management seems to be
pretty decent for a budget case that's
for this one is around 50 bucks us 50 to
55 I think this is hexxus net Thank You
hexxus but it's you know so all the
prices are in euro so I would imagine
around 50 bucks how much is it in euros
50 is it 49 49 9 49 let me see scroll
down all the way scrolling dude it to do
all the way all the way pay $49.99 that
is about 55 us okay so I was I was right
um so that's not bad this is a fairly
this is this makes it cheaper actually
than the spec alpha because the spec
alpha just did a bill in that is like 80
bucks 75 to 80 depending on where you
get it this is significantly cheaper you
can make a pretty decent budget rig with
this this case I actually wish I'd use
this for my $850
Rison bill recently I don't like the
front of it I'm sorry I don't either I
don't I hate it it's a solid thought
budget you're right it's got painted
interior
here in the cadets and all that said for
sure 50 bucks but the black doesn't look
it's still about my favorite at all but
I like it over the the colored the
colored accent once yeah I I totally
agree
I completely agree it's not my thing I
think it just looks I like the over this
I like the functionality of it that you
get for the price it was yeah I don't I
don't like that front and I just don't
yeah no I agree sorry I feel like
everything else is so minimal on the
case like the rest of the frame is
completely just like could be a fractal
case but on the front is just it just
there's a huge clash there but there's
like two styles Jerry hey Jerry write
this yeah oh hey it says cool thanks man
be safe here I got a move you the real
MVP um but also want to mention large a
side panel window that's tinted you know
you don't find that on too many $50.00
cases I gotta get this already I don't
mind that I know like course not it's
just a weird angular front thing of
course there's never gonna work with
this skin seven expansion slots max GPU
clearance of 370 millimeters so you can
pretty much put you know a reference GTX
1080 in here and so forth max CPU cooler
clearance of 150 millimeters didn't say
if there was any I don't believe there's
any Pio support you're not going to find
a IO support unless you do some custom
work in a case like this if you bought
an AI oh you'd be spending significantly
more than the cost of the case Jo mm-hmm
which which I mean I guess I don't know
right um yeah don't do that
nope don't do that all right moving on
to our next day or next segment that was
hot and heavy hardware let's let's talk
about um let's talk about being the crap
out of each other and face off okay
that's always fun
guys guys place your bets when you this
opportunity to the pine for donations
place your bets in chat oh yeah on who's
gonna win and then great idea can yeah
that's totally gonna like it's a great
investment
alright so what doesn't make any sense
peanut do we need any place bets like
that I'm a mess
let's uh let's let's it's a fire up
dragon fist three this is age of the
warrior
okay we might have played this game or
maybe we play dragon fist - neither one
I don't remember there are a limited
number of free online crappy multiplayer
games so we might be recycling some of
these but it does have a two player
option I don't are you sure about that I
thought there was an unlimited number of
no free online crappy games you would
think that until you you run a segment
like face off and then instantly come up
with these actually there there are an
infinite number but most of that
infinite number or crappy games okay
which makes also no sense um sorry I'm
trying not to roll over my dog with my
chair right now that would be bad
he's he's he's really in not the
greatest position and he could easily
kill you hurt him too bad yeah that's
true
alright to player let's fire this up um
for those of you who are new this is
simply just me and Paul playing a game
and then there's like a awful punishment
at the end of it player one here whoever
loses a and D to walk left and right I'm
WASD and then so I tried messing with
this it seems the only ones that work
WASD for you it's up down left right and
then you need to punch and kick with
four and five as usually yeah because
you have a numpad yeah shoot okay and
then I'm teen or or I could maybe I can
probably do it with this dumb pet over
here yeah I do that that would still
work why don't you just use OB kit can
you have the keys on that - can't just
use probably all right just do that I'll
try just get our own keyboard why would
that work I'll try
so I'm T and knowing what it is there's
actually and wide uh I think I've
ignored well I guess yeah just take a
second to to absorb it all in just let
it sink in okay okay okay I think I'm I
think I'm good alright I want a guy I
want to be the Asian guy I think this is
as big as I can make it make me the
Asian guy you you want to be the Asian
which that they're all the Asian guys
Kyle that's a little racist Paul they
all look the same you better check
yourself before you wreck yourself okay
um I'll be I'll be um I'll be this guy
with the
the same mustache as me him here yeah
Tiger the tiger the tiger player - I
will be you I'm gonna choose based on
the name okay
Nia green serpent who I can't like green
servant oh actually I'm a green surpise
Imogene okay okay oh wait hold on okay
okay I am supposed to be working okay
I'm on the left you on the right you're
green obviously you're the green sir

why I'd like this choice was to help the
people watching at home did we just hit
some lag I have no idea that was weird
oh my goodness that was very strange Oh
midair is very chopping right now I do
not know what is going on dude you need
to upgrade your GPU man

kidding me there's like no aliasing Wow
Wow
then I can eat serpent diet two frames a
second that victory this attack oh yeah
oh wait you're still up person still up
heck how how come your health keeps
regenerating it's not regenerating oh
wait green and the black what is that
the red bars there's reason why some
sort of power gun why can't I hit you
this really the green serpents is not
really living up to his name oh you got
me in a corner you would never win a
fight kicking like that kicking the way
you are you're like pulp like poking me
with your toes that's that's what your
take that's like you're doing right now
very powerful toes see that's kind of BS
like half of my you can hit me in the
air but I person is because I'm freakin

well um does that camp though should we
- yeah that was no you beat me twice you
in a row man two in a row anchor you
can't you can't mess with the tiger in
this no you cannot
all right so the punishment for Paul's
horrendous loss that was horrible I was
is um defeated and humiliated is he has
to chug a beer
you had pound a whole beer not just
average Lanai that's not what you said
it says pound a beer a meaning one beer
ounce a pound a part of a beer that's
fine I'm fine pounding a beer I'm just
pointing out that you changed no it's
just the way this you're right you wrote
that you type something in naked maybe
you change out of the last second that's
fine we get no I know I can i can t
annexations here look I can hit ctrl Z
and show you that I Hashmi just starts
deleting them all I'm saying is the way
that you described it to me when you're
like hey do you think maybe we could do
this as the punishment that's that's
fine hey what how am I gonna patent
where's oh because I've got I have a
full beer here okay but I have this beer
here and I only have one glass all right
um hmm I have my water glass jug your
water and then alright it's not that to
check twice basically second water
unusually and then and then pour beer
into it alright how about this how about
since you think that there are some just
discrepancy I don't think you could do
like 3/4 of a beer we get the title half

but that's clever those wait on an
opening sure when fresher tales yeah go

you all for being a part of that that
was completely magical in every way
incidentally my half of the show might
be slightly more entertaining out -
mm-hmm
who does doesn't say much
moving on to news let's talk about Vega
Vega Vega and how it is for Johnny may
be limited in quantity there's the bear
may be offered in limited quantities in
the first few months of launch this
vehicle comes from our friends at WCC of
tech and it's been two years they start
off the article by saying it's been two
years since AMD is really competed with
Nvidia in the in the high-end graphic
space there's really it's just been the
RX 5 80 aurochs 480 happen till this
point that's the best they've done and
there's really been nothing to compete
with the high-end Nvidia stuff until now
with Vega we're looking to to get the
gtx 1070 in the 1080 maybe the 1080 TI a
run for their money however it is slated
for release in q2 and rumors that have
flocked to tweak town these are rumors
that were picked up by good ol tweak
town have stated Wylie reading your WC
CF Tech article because the WCC of tech
credits tweak town this is the first one
that I saw okay
and I figure there's less ads on this
page um so we found this video I'm gonna
go to the tweaked-out are a tweet out
has stated that um like look what the
tweak town article has when we you
in ad blocker we should just whitelist
them permanently this is an Anthony
story though so credit all credit to
Anthony yeah credit and he's in if he
happens to be watching today he's gonna
be like super pissed that we're actually
reading the story FWC CF Tech yep that
is that is true I honestly didn't
realize it was tweet Kevin well I
actually did and I was like yeah but I
open this page I always feel like the
first one I go to like the first article
I have to white list a limo fly though
it's just such a pain no look at this
look at this cool graphic that there you
see see text added up with the graphics
it's kind of textured yep bring it home
they probably just hired some guy just
to make that picture just for this
article yep detail and detail so anyway
they get will release allegedly in
limited quantities only 16,000 units
I believe globally which is nothing for
the first few months of launch due to
 HBM to yields ah yeah I'm also
potentially bottlenecked by TSV supply
TSV is what connects the GPU with the
memory and the packaged I there's a lot
of design complexity apparently when it
comes to crafting an HBM GPU and AMD
seems to be struggling with that at the
moment according again to this rumor who
talked to tweet town seems like this is
Fiji all over again in a way this is
what we saw with the the theory cards
the nano cards with their HP m1 memory
or that's redundant there HBM one and
adding board partners even have still
had yet to receive Vega for internal
testing which is kind of interesting we
might see AMD release a limited edition
model of the card and selling it
exclusively but themselves at first and
then we'll see custom variants from the
Adhan board partners release a couple
months after launch a couple months
potentially open week so it doesn't look
that long maybe weeks hopefully weeks
usually it's a few weeks and for a good
launch maybe it's so a month a month and
a half like if it was a full two months
so it kind of suck yeah and it depends
on what the reference cooler will look
like on you know yeah on this as well if
it's if it's packing you know like a
decent liquid cooler on or something
like that
and the temperatures are good no coil
wine
my pick one up you know sure they might
satisfy me for the first few weeks but
if it's just like a crappy blower style
air cooler than I'm gonna be mad and
very impatient for the the custom ones
to come out but um yeah q2 is really all
we have to go on for now but we might be
getting a we're already like halfway
through to - yeah it's it's mid-may one
skew to end and the end of June June so
June July April May June
that means it's got to be coming like
you know copy text maybe after come
today like a few weeks after copy text
at the latest there but we might be
getting some more details on the release
date the exact release date for Vega as
we'll find out later in this half of the
show but for now we can mosey on over to
our next story which is about X 299 ooh
to be unveiled at the PC gaming show on
June 12 X 99 this is exciting this is
the annual show that happens at e3 which
is going to be in Los Angeles again
this year right after copy text in June
just to point out this is another WCC F
Tech article so you know it could be
could be wrong it could all be wrong or
it could be from a different publication
originally that could also be true but
it's going to be hosted the the PC
gaming show is going to be hosted by
Intel and PC gamer this year with a
focus on X 299 there will be a big
unveiling during the show as well as sky
like X and KB like X which are the two
CPU families that will be watching on X
299 this is followed by market
availability on June 26th so not more
than a month after this show we'll be
able to buy these things and actually
build systems with them which is
exciting the first X 299 motherboard
teases have just released from msi
norris msi first of all features just a
little glimpse of the lower region a
third quadrant of their motherboard
featuring some blacked out PCB action
it's like they're all in for those heat
shields the heat seals that works as
well and I wonder like ryback's
whatsoever they better have done
something to them I really hope they've
done like they've added something other
like hey look the old heat shields that
were proven do nothing or make things
worse worse yeah these are better if
they're the same they're really gonna
get on for that but yeah um okay I
like I said you don't need to use them
yeah but I like lots of m dot 2 slots
though that's cool yeah maybe they're
there to protect the slot until you
install something in it they're like
dust defenders yeah that's what they are
they should just rebrand it as dust
defenders we way better so it features
RGB LEDs of course for pcie 3.0 by 16
slots so potentially for way crossfire
sli with this bad boy which is pretty
sweet you get would be supported by the
graphics vendor but whatever yes of
course
3m about two slots of course with
shields I even put a little note beware
and a large chipset heatsink with the
dragon logo it's this overhang which you
can kind of tell right there it says
caution passion says caution
ultimate power are you serious Wow
stupid wow that's so silly it's Devon
silly it's very small so it's not like
it's a huge impact yeah that's caution
ultimate power is come on
basically the like the there's like it
like a white dwarf star like basically
where it is part of this motherboard
that's what it feeds off of I'm just
waiting for her like the next
motherboard to have just like
crime-scene tape like all over it like
oh yeah frames were murdered beware this
is crime scenes were murdered brutally
at this scene I don't know I don't know
G but um I got a rs.1 as Horace is a
featuring several pcie 3.0 by 16 slots
as well there's an ASIS Horace logo
sorry on the X 299 heatsink and there's
an m dot to guard that looks a bit more
substantial than the the msi board but
you can't really tell is this the only
image for the thoris yeah okay yeah so
um see this looks like it's actually a
heatsink
yeah it looks it's metal not just a slim
piece or I guess it's like yeah exact
I have some some girth to it and that
was pretty much all we got from Oris
okay couple other notes about sky like X
just to really briefly recap a lot of
the information that's already been put
out there sky like X will feature skews
rocking 12 8 I'm sorry 12 10 8 and 6
core models based on 6 yeah based on
static architecture how did before we
want EVP for all of them clock speeds
range anywhere from 3 gigahertz to 4
gigahertz potentially past 4 years
particularly for the 8 &amp;amp; 6 core parts
and we've got 12 cores
the 12th core model is going to feature
more PCIe lanes with faster memory
support and using a new LG 2020 66
socket which we believe will be
compatible with the last two generations
that Club processors so backwards
compatibility up to two generations that
is going to be nice up to 24 PCIe 3
lanes on the chipset quad channel memory
of course up to ddr4 2667 megahertz
native so you're gonna have to overclock
your memory if you want to push beyond
that KB like X this is kind of the black
sheep for the sort of an anomaly here
and I'm not fully sure if I understand
KB like X just yet but according to the
article it's intended to incentivize
users to upgrade to the enthusiast
platform for less money 400 bucks for
these two quad-core SKUs that are not
offered that's not less money $400 I
know that's why I don't I don't really
quite understand it's not less money no
because you can buy the six that is
that's more than what the six cores cost
right now
correct no it's it's just it's
definitely strange I'd have to see what
we have to see what the performance is
like maybe they could I don't know what
I think what are they gonna ever think
the most higher higher high dog speed
because maybe you can hit higher clock
speeds than the six cores because it's
got less fewer cores and you know it'll
have higher IPC perhaps I don't know
like in a landscape where Rison doesn't
exist this might have been something
where it's like okay you know gentry
level product - for people who want to
get into the enthusiast platform like
you said with an inexpensive chip but
if it's if they're already playing and
charging more for a quad core and what
there's six core scoffs right now and
you can get rise in six cores for less
than what the mainstream quad cores cost
right now yeah exactly
what I okay is very yeah and you're only
getting dual channels memory support oh
so you can't even okay all right corkle
yeah well I mean that would make sense
because the memory controllers on the
processor so yeah but I mean what why so
it's like a weird period behind you jump
onto this platform where even on Intel
it would seem like it makes more sense
even if you're not even looking at AMD
it seems like it will like why don't I
just spend 50 or 100 bucks less on a z2
70 motherboard and get a kid it cuz it's
still the same architecture it's KB Lake
yeah or or why not spend a hundred to
two hundred fifty bucks more and get one
of like the six core sky like X
processors yeah and have access to more
features like ddr4 like it just seems
like it's so in the middle like it's not
but it's it's in the middle between just
the consumer and the high-end desktop
market but it's not like we're it's it's
not like best of both worlds metal it's
like worst of both worlds yeah like
you're getting you're getting none of
the features you're getting all the like
limited features of the consumer grade
market and then you're getting the the
high price of the enthusiasts grade
high-end desktop so so even right here
comparing assembly 600k you know
obviously rumoured specs 7600 k confirm
specs with 76 40k rumoured specs same
process same number of cores and threads
76 40k doesn't even well they don't know
what the boost clock is I might might
ship at a higher frequency dual channel
this says quad channel this does say
quad channel for the 76 40k oh maybe
it's going to be like a maybe they're
going to add support for it later
yeah it could be a firmware patch higher
TDP which might indicate a
and that it's shipping at a higher
frequency but yeah it really depends on
the on the what they're going to try to
charge charge for this processor and how
much the motherboards are going to cost
x-gen i x99 motherboards typically start
at 200 bucks for like a cut-rate one i
mean maybe maybe a little less than that
now because it's getting a slightly
older but you got to pay more for those
high-end motherboards and it just it
seems seems strange to me let's see um
okay this so there will be an update in
the future to include support for
quad-channel memory for cabling ex what
like it sounds weird in that case it
would seem like is it's like firmware
locked out or something it's the
controller is capable of it and then
that would be an artificial lockout
right if it doesn't just chip with that
capability
that's like quad-channel memory seems
like at least something they could say
well this is something extra that you're
getting with the enthusiast platform
compared to mainstream granted they're
probably as more limited application for
saying here's how quad-channel memory
will actually help you out and make a
difference because here it says katie
like x-series processors will only
support dual channel ram stick to the
native speeds yeah
and so but then the spec sheet says one
channel so maybe also w c CF tech
article and sometimes to make their
articles longer they take parts of older
articles and update the newer articles
with them so maybe that's something from
that could be a mix yeah yeah but anyway
at any rate I'm definitely more excited
about scaling X then I am maybe like X
at this point it'll be interesting to
test KB like X of course just to see
just to validate all of our thoughts
about it and but yeah up until that
point we can just look forward to the PC
gaming show at e3 which should happen
about a week or two after we get back
from Computex and then we'll have more
information maybe on you know on
everything on all the links I'll gladly
read up on the e3 news from home yeah I
don't think I'm going to try and
probably not gonna go for that
alright alright and our last story for
today is about the AMD financial analyst
day and potentially unveiling some some
juicy news about Zen plus ooh um Nabby
Zen where's it gonna be now Navi not
this is again one of those Katy Lake
caddy lake things um Navi in Avatar it's
the Navi right yeah isn't it or
something so I'm going to say Navi okay
for now and Vega should be detailed at
this nice press event then be on May
16th and it's going to feature the
presentations from all the big players
at AMD Lisa sue mark Papermaster
my favorite last name for a corporate
tech guy ever Jim Anderson Raja Raja
Kaduri oh good ol Raja Raja is gonna is
going to be delivering some cool
information because he is with he's the
chief architect of RTG radio technology
group he'll be revealing future GPU
plans this is not to be confused with
vega's launch event but it might give us
a better idea maybe even a specific date
on when Vega is going to launch that
would be cool that would be nice um I
don't think anyone who cares about much
of anything else no I don't want to go
to e3 at this point Snoop um like like
Paul said we only know that it's going
to be dropping Vig is going to be
dropping in q2 which were already almost
through with and in addition to that
though like I said they're going to be
detailing Zen plus and Zen too or at
least talking about their Raven Ridge ap
use and Naples server platform we did
hear quite a bit about Naples at the
last AMD press conference but Zen plus
is expected to offer higher IPC than the
current Zen rising processors okay and
obviously it's I would imagine it's
going to be a m4 as well so compatible
with a lot of the motherboards that are
already out there but we don't really
have any more information on that I
don't think we we really know yet about
Zen plus and what kind of like via this
is n plus n 2 it says Zen plus is
expected to offer higher IPC and then it
says that at the
event they could potentially be talking
about Zen too as well okay we don't
really know because then to from my
understanding would be completely new or
like yeah a new mic micro tech micro
architecture Zen plus I feel like would
be more like your element yeah the
refinement or something like that so
yeah maybe better performance for water
or something like that but it'll be
interesting to see AMD adapt something
similar to the tik-tok cadence the Intel
used to have yeah that would be kind of
cool actually you can do Zen they do
like microarchitecture and then add a
plus for the refinements mm-hmm and then
do another microarchitecture and then
although at this point they're they're
going to have difficulty shrinking the
process node so I guess that would be
more of a challenge indeed anyway though
that is gonna conclude it that were tech
news and my half the show it was a
relatively short one because we were
doing so Paul and I were tied up a
little bit earlier today yeah doing a
working on a special super-secret
project which I guess we should unveil
and sort of talk about just really
briefly sure we can show people that so
our beautiful moderator cell processing
who's in chat right now I believe is in
both YouTube and twitch he's been an
awesome friend and mod to to us both
he's been very dedicated we don't pay
him anything it's all volunteer work but
he's just super on it like just with
everything he's been a huge help to our
channels to everything so we thought we
would give back and build him a system
today which we did and it's it's pretty
awesome that's the system that you see
in the thumbnail for for for today's
show on YouTube that's his his new build
that we'll be shipping to him
momentarily and we also made a video a
two-part video yeah on building that
system and the whole process it's a
two-part the series that the first half
is going to be on my channel and then
the second half will be on Paul's
there's going to be like a nice
cliffhanger in the middle and stuff like
that and you'll get to see us showing it
to sell and stuff through through the
internet and whatnot but thank you very
much so I want to say thanks for all you
do for awesome hardware for me and Paul
we we love you and we appreciate
everything you
do and hopefully the PCB Belcher is a
nice simple for that so yeah yep
I wish I could add to that but it was it
was so so eloquent and concise oh well
you know I you know I take classes for
words attention to the word classes yeah
so um stay tuned stay tuned for that we
should be having we should be dropping
those videos
sometime later this week maybe by uh
this week time this week on the weekend
is what we're looking at in dish I'm
still still editing needs to happen and
stuff so yeah but you guys should enjoy
it I hope yes um all right let's let's
let's round things out with the typical
due date reading reading of the comments
grand the shouting of the Johnsons
Johnson Oh
oh my god that scared me Johnson zzzz
did he look your hero licked my hand I
didn't know what it was I thought it was
like a sea urchin that was trying to eat
me oh he got up I can finally scoot over
again Finch here oh here
massive alright it's a large lift so
let's just go over some donations all
y'all you guys can still donate while
we're reading as long as we don't get to
the end of it before you donate um last
chance
flip and Fred five dollars yeah no
comment just five bucks whoo makes me
feel dirty when they don't comment lip
and Fred and I feel like a stripper you
know it makes you feel like they're
gonna come back in the future and be
like remember that time I donated yeah
yeah yeah right now you owe me what if
whatever this right they might demand
you know that there's a wide range of
possible things Nick hey remember that
remember that time I donated didn't even
ask a question yeah uh yes I've come for
me it's retribution time asshole Oh God
bend over bitch now all right thank you
very much flippin Fred hopefully don't
do that to it I take my nation what's
going on in the dark yeah I know um okay
he said nothing he gave us a blank
canvas man that's where we went with
imaginations are generally worse than
reality okay uh tech guy nation for the
two bucks send me a gtx 1080 might need
to donate a little bit more than just
for future every fleeting opposite of
the last comment
give me things automatic mat for the ten
bucks thank you automatic mat for being
a regular contributor here on the show
hi guys
can you welcome my friend Bianca -
awesome hardware also when you're at
Computex can you check out any gaming
speakers or VR gadgets you see for me
thanks first of all uh welcome Bianca
welcome Bianca thank you for watching
the show hopefully we don't scare you we
haven't scared you away by glad to have
you here we would love to see you next
week and the week after that we could
use every week assuming that you are
female never leave Bianca assuming that
your name is forever
definitely use the additional female
audience I feel like that's one area
where we're quite limited and by use
Kyle means nothing bad at all he did not
mean nothin for anything see I didn't
even even get that thought in my head
until you would had mentioned it well I
didn't want you to be misinterpreted no
of course not
we treat all of our viewers but you can
respect here awesome Hardware it's a
fun-loving show thanks Matt thanks Matt
and I'll will be checking out a bunch of
different stuff at Computex so I would
be surprised if we're covering some of
those things that you mentioned VR
speakers is that was that a specific no
gaming speakers gaming speaker yeah okay
buddy
let me fund check out it's kind of hard
to do speaker videos cuz viewers can't
really hear the audience today it's all
subjective but we'll see we can do
thanks again Matt Robert fish for the
two bucks what do you think of a duel Z
on as a workstation yes I mean that
sounds ideal yeah why not using a
workstation Reis processor for a
workstation sounds exactly what they're
intended yeah you used word that's good
Jerry about that yeah got some
experience with them duels eons he does
Eric shell for the 5 bucks
dr. jelly here 5 bucks pays oh no five
dollars says Paul can't play the ukulele
behind him I've played it on the show
before that is true yes you have he's
trying to trick you he's traded it to
drink even it's completely reverse
psychology yes is going to reverse back
on to you yep by now by not playing the
ukulele good projection right there
but thank you for the donation I think
he's just jelly what his name's Doug
wants her to play ukulele I should
donate him I have show yeah I know this
is a horrible let me give your friend
money man come on god the dog the do V
two dollars no 202 risin build with Vega
eventually yes yes
actually the go anywhere do anything PC
that I built the while back is going to
be getting an upgrade with the the bio
star X 370gt n Mini ITX a.m. for
motherboard very soon that should be
exciting because I'll be upgrading the
video card as well it'll be a full
overhaul of the entire system so stay
tuned for that it'll be my first mini
small form-factor
rise and build which is pretty exciting
thanks dog Ronin 2300 DK hundred DKK
Ivanova DK's that's the Democratic
Korean green Congo Congo no that's not
that right it's not accurate at all hi
from DK Denmark no uh Detroit dick it's
a Danish Danish Danish crap or soda the
crota corona the is that an is that a
razor feature well you know the razor
Corona the razor chroma ah razor
chromoly I oh sorry about that
very close all right hey from the DK I
met you last year at Computex and I'm
going back this year so I hope they just
say hi again and share another beer with
Kyle thanks for all the great content
see and type a beers on me hell yeah
thanks man yeah Ronin I'm just gonna be
shouting running all around the show
floor router run as soon as you pop out
and go hi Kyle would you want with a
give me a beer um I'm definitely
remember I always remember free beer
Eric for the five dollars should I buy a
second Eric's four eighty five eighty
now or wait and sell my RX 480 to buy a
Vega card currently running on an Rx 488
gigabyte reference if you need the extra
frames I would say go for Vega having a
single GPU again for the millionth time
yeah a single faster GPU is typically
more advised than than having a
crossfire sli setup yeah if you're 48
gig is getting you by for now I would
just hold out because Vegas supposed to
launch in the next
month and a half so yeah hold out wait
for Vega to launch and then probably
upgrade to a single Vega card because
that's usually preferable to a two-way
configuration not every not every game
supports multi-gpu all right Brian Webb
thank you Eric
yeah thank you very much Eric Brian Webb
$5.00 I've got a gtx 980ti and a 6700 K
with no immediate plans to upgrade but
when should I upgrade next gen gen after
uh I would say your everybody cuz you
here for them good for now unless you
want to go to like yo yeah okay if you
want to get it for cash for using higher
resolutions then maybe consider a GPU
upgrade like for the next generation but
honestly even if you're at 1080 or 1440
you're probably fine for a couple lucky
at least another year or two I would say
yeah yeah but thank you very much
Gerald Baker for the Bronx Gerald gerald
dude um tomorrow's already the 10th wait
is he's quoting it somehow yeah ok I'm
sorry it's dead it is true currently
drinking green flash palette wrecker out
of my bit weight glass oh nice lovely
thank you gents for the fine drink we're
cheers from NN well cheers to Gerald
yeah thank you very much appreciate glad
your knowing the glass drink but I'm out
of beer put that glass to use that glass
set Forester Forestier horas da forest
yay the first year it's it's he's more
Foresti than you are for rest dear
that's yes I'm not very first $10 I have
an extremely stable ocmi FX 8350 for
over a year after an unfortunate day of
tweaking I ended up doing a seamless
clear and since then even with the same
settings I cannot get a stable overclock
aha yikes um uh says that's tricky
my guess my guess would be that you're
running at a higher than stock voltage
for your overclock that you're running
for over a year which probably means
that your CPU has degraded to some
degree and you probably can't hit that
overclock anymore that'd be that'd be my
guess
yeah um that again Pat maybe see if
there's a BIOS update for your
motherboard - I could try that it's a
little bored probably but but there's a
decent chance you're just going to need
to go with a slightly
but you're gonna need to roll back the
overclock a little bit to to get stable
again or just you know upgrade to Rison
or upgrade to racin that's also an
option
Brian Webb fellows one dollar for each
victory in sword fight oh ho whoa why
thank you very much sir
we appreciate your victory money uh I'm
doing sword fight and it's okay Steven
help now $5 maybe the KB like X chips
are for Intel to have Apple use we know
their clients will buy it some other
people in in chat we're also pointing
out maybe it's something that's more
geared towards system integrators of
that kind of thing which I mean I guess
is true for people don't understand as
well but yeah I don't know I don't know
how much of the business that
compromises use like people buying the
computer that don't really know
functionally what's in it - yeah the
difference between this that's got to be
shrinking the difference between a Sandy
Bridge quad core and a skylight quad
core yeah that kind of thing um yeah but
it could be yep Thank You Steven
ridiculous prime for the $10 each of us
just ten bucks ridiculous you're
ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous with a
Z at the end ridiculous DRAM take your
video nation hell yeah criticism and
been healeth that's that's a cool name
that is cool to to power just pounds GPP
the give up thank you for those good
look thank you no comment thank you very
much and oh honey Oh tahan words or the
rims work Oh tehani
Lorenzo drama I don't know five dollars
since I have a block here's some lost
revenue oh that's awesome
we'll get some for Paul later love your
channels guys that's well thank you for
their a great fan that is off you're the
kind of fan we like let me let me like
you um and then finally let's do some
Johnson shoutouts cuz I can tell ya for
donations any more any more trickling
will cover them on my half of the show
deep I have five it looks like whoo yay
yay for those I want to start off with
one that actually rolled in this morning
but I still wanted to say a big Johnson
to Marat from Florida who got a heavy
metal grade shirt the thumbscrew logo
thank you much for that beautiful we
also have
aeryn aeryn double Johnson Aryan double
Johnson from a beautiful Vista
California Lu got the thumbscrew gray
tri-blend t-shirt from me and some
glasses
lovely lovely double Johnson Garrett
Thank You Garrett spelled Gonza Ohio
gets a double Johnson mate got a pub
glass you got actually two pub glasses
you got some glasses from me too lovely
you have a full set beautiful the full
awesome hardware glassware set Travis
from Virginia Virginia Beach Virginia
also got a pub glass a single over here
so that should work well for drinking
Zachary Johnson to you sir for picking
up a glass as well lovely Zachary
actually Zachary gets a double Johnson
you did Travis right I think I said a
trick Travis Dilla Johnson yes
yes Travis is a double Johnson picked up
an overclocking mug wonderful and ranked
Zachary for grabbing that English pub
glass for me lots people getting getting
the awesome hardware drink we're set
yeah that's good that's that's great
they like connects us you know I don't
drinking I need Sandia I need a couple
of yours yeah I'll send you some okay
cool
good luck John all right my people can
talk to you every all right that's gonna
conclude it for my half of the show
we'll wrap it up actually it feels like
we've dragged on but it's the only been
an hour yeah we're right about pouria so
uh so you're on twitch stay where you
are
yes if you're on youtube you jump over
to my channel Paul's hardware and we'll
be kicking things off there for the
second half momentarily what he said
okay okay okay
see you everyone should hit thumbs up -
