we are streaming welcome to awesome
hardware episode 121 side-b if you miss
side a you can go ahead and check it out
on Paul's YouTube channel that's easy to
do that calm slash Paul's hardware you
can find a link in the description below
if you're watching me on YouTube right
now this is a live show that Paul and I
do every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time right here on Twitch on TV
/ awesome hardware and we also of course
stream it to our respective YouTube
channels we split the show up into two
we like to have a couple beers while
we're at it and occasionally curse
cheers to all of you and thank you for
joining us tonight on this beautiful
evening here in the it is a lovely
evening here on the Internet we've had
lovely weather recently we have sunny
and that's cool I I think I can dig the
although it's a Southern California it's
pretty much sunny all the time I can't
really complain but we've got a great
show a great second half of the show
planned for you guys today first off
we'll try to sell you some shits that we
have on our stores that we've we've been
gathering we've been gathering lots
of over the years that we are
trying to sell and now we have like lots
of I remember when I only used to
have three or four shits on my site is
only like two lines yeah like two lines
of and now I've got like eight
lines of
so buy all the hats are relatively
new beanies are relatively new women's
shirts with the bit wit logo no no don't
don't press any of the buttons on the
Scimitar problem it's like a grab it's
like a wild card it's like a grab bag of
 you like you don't know what what's
coming don't touch any of the buttons on
this matter this there is no back button
so buy all the you can go to bigwig
tech slash store or you can go to
pawpaws website which is a pulsar where
you can pick up hoodies mugs glasses
some awesome so mugs are on sale
right now go ahead and buy everything
from
from each of us we will appreciate it
and we'll give you a nice Johnson shout
out at the end of the show and if you do
and and we have a huge design contest
going on because Paul and I are bad at
designing things um so we are doing a
contest so that you can design stuff for
us particularly a logo for some hardware
that could be put on a shirt or a mug or
glass or whatever runner-ups who you
know if we use your concept that you
submit you'll get a hundred bucks I
believe and it's three hundred dollars
if we actually use your exact vector
image so any kind of artist whether
you're amateur professional whatever
prosumer please give us some good
designs and we will potentially sell
them on our site so it'll be really cool
and also Bryan Bryan murex it who has
been a huge patron and fan of the show
who's also sent Paul and I some really
cool fan made stuff he is also going to
be selling some of his merchandise or
his designs on our stores they will be
featured on either of our stores really
cold the the the the sword fight one is
my favorite with Paul and I doing sort
of ice over a Princess Bride sword fight
because of sword fight that will be sold
on our stores as well so a lot of cool
stuff going on right now go ahead and
check that out so I talk like a pirate
day so I figured we're here so real
quick swatch at people saying that
YouTube is down we still have YouTube
resolutions not great no no all the way
up just yeah we still got YouTube guys
so it's looking okay here how it works
works from not sure if YouTube isn't
being able to deliver this to everyone
but it seems right for us so sorry sorry
if you having troubles with it yeah
everything looks okay on our end from
what we're seeing but speaking of the
fact that it's Talk Like a Pirate Day my
first videos unlisted is it that's like
maybe what they say I should
double-check that huh oh good lord
okay publicizing now on public saving it
alright go ahead and f5 that and it
should be good to go
it is now public I apologize
don't expect much from a guy who's
filled beard twice in two weeks on one
live street those minor issues indeed so
uh speaking of speaking of news let's
talk about some tech news
like I mentioned Paul and I mentioned
earlier it is Talk Like a Pirate Day
today and so I thought I would start the
show off by talking about the Pirate Bay
website hey
so befitting perfect butt Pirate Bay I
don't know this is a bit of a
controversial topic here they've
apparently been found out to use visitor
their visitor CPUs so anyone who's
visiting the site they've been utilizing
their CPUs for cryptocurrency mining um
without their knowledge and this is an
article from hexxus it's been spread all
over but this one in particulars from
hexxus there was a redditor who noticed
that when he went unto the site certain
web pages that his cpu all of a sudden
started hitting eighty percent plus
utilization just on the pirate bay and
then toward free 'no web browsing it's
very processors supernormal i mean that
that's kind of the the the workload that
you see that's the sort of utilization
you see from like rendering full videos
or you know just doing crazy should
playing crisis whatever definitely not
from browsing the web so TorrentFreak
got a hold of this article and they sort
of pried the Pirate Bay staff to find
out what was going on turns out that the
CPU spike was caused by a one day test a
24 hour test period of the site
deploying a Java JavaScript crypto minor
app hmm so basically this was they're
just trying things out they're sort of
experimenting right now in the site
footer is some mining code which
basically uses visitor CPU power into
mining Manero coins which is a
cryptocurrency I have I'm not too
familiar with Manero coins I'm not
exactly sure where that scales in terms
of the the value correctly with De Niro
De Niro so maybe it's a Robert De Niro
Robert De Niro and it's Robert De Niro
courtesy De Niro means money like the
Spanish yeah it's perfect so he would be
the perfect person to endorse that that
that that cryptocurrency but what's
interesting is there was no warning to
visitors they were just automatically
being hit with
this money workload Gennaro yeah didn't
they at home I love how the Internet's
they're too tangled is man when you're
like I'm not sure about that you can be
like boom then and it has your back so I
hate when I don't have good service I'm
at sofa I feel like I don't know
anything so it's a little bit shady um
you know the fur for them to be using
your CPU for for profit and not tell you
about it but what is it a little bit
shady for you to be going to the Pirate
Bay
yeah exactly and then and then and that
goes to show like can you really blame
or what did you expect really from a
website that you know is all about
piracy and stuff and supports that sort
of thing however if you are a patron of
the site and you don't want to get hit
with any of this
then there are JavaScript Java
JavaScript apps that can be removed
using browser settings or extensions
such as no script and script block kind
of like adblock but for JavaScript so
immediately stop whatever mining code
was built into the website for you in
particular the Pirate Bay actually got
in contact with TorrentFreak and said
that they're trying to reduce the number
the reason why they're doing this is is
because there's so many ads on their
website right now and they don't like it
they want to remove and try to reduce
the number of ads on their website and
supplement that loss in revenue with
this mining mining activity this mining
scheme if you will they also claim that
the eighty percent CPU usage was kind of
a fluke and it was due to a typo within
the mining code so in the final version
of the code users can expect more like a
20 to 30 percent CPU utilization which
isn't quite as demanding of course now I
think the main question here is whether
or not visitors will be prompted or
asked whether or not they're cool with
this sort of the sort of I don't know
the sort of handoff with with their CPU
I think if if permission is being asked
if they're asking permission from the
user then I feel like people who are
into it and you're like okay cool I
don't like I don't like to see a
thousand ads
a webpage who does and if I'm not doing
anything else about browsing the web
then yeah sure go ahead and utilize some
CPU I'm not gonna notice the difference
it will make a difference to my user
experience and I get a you know a web
browsing experience with fewer ads then
go for it but if they're doing it behind
visitors backs I personally think that
might be a bit invasive and kind of a
dick moves slash shady so I think it's a
it's a controversial topic but it's
interesting to see that certain websites
are pooling visitor resources for
cryptocurrency mining and of course this
is not gonna sit well with people who
are just against cryptocurrency mining
in the first place so it's you know
everything you know what yeah I don't
know what I'd be interested to see this
same type of application but you instead
of doing crypto mining it doing like
folding at home or something like that
like every time yeah every time you go
to this website like it it it you know
starts doing some folding at home on
your CPU or something no some like if
you looked at it it was like oh is
applied towards something that was like
for the greater good rather than just
like Randy's making money off of you
yeah and a website or something like
that right would probably change
people's perspective a little bit but um
mmhmm I know that's interesting I mean I
I if they can if they can keep it
minimal like I don't want to be like oh
I'm gonna start this video rendering now
I'm gonna go to this website now my
videos gonna render twenty percent
slower right like that sucks
yeah I don't have to turn my like prayer
my processing priority on my browser
shut down compared to everything else
that what what would you prefer would
you prefer a site that was riddled with
ads or would you prefer a site that
utilized some of your CPU just you know
obviously there's a bunch of variables
here but just overall I will probably
prefer the ads assuming they're just
display ads and there nothing that Auto
plays no place rewards it does or that
like pop-ups or pop behind or any like
the the stuff that ads do
that's just annoying as hell right just
say to get you to accidentally click
click
or something like that yeah standard
display ads banners or whatever I can
ignore the hell out of those and I'm
fine with it whatever I haven't been on
the Pirate Bay in years because I
stopped pirating a long time ago and I
have no idea what the ads are like on
that site anymore so I I don't know I I
can't say it definitely does depend on
the gravity of the advertisements and
the usage of course of your CPU but yeah
leave your thoughts in chat we will
we'll be sure to miss them all you are a
paragon of virtue indeed let's move on
to our next article which is about
thread Ripper no wait you already cover
this in your half damn it
you stole this my toaster meal this
stolen stolen from me right under my
nose it's okay you did a great job
summing it up and I have nothing else to
contribute to it really was from
September 16th September 16th three days
ago
yes but I think it covers a lot of the
same stuff that you mentioned devourer
had deleted reddit for 1950 X and
proceeded to sort of sand down the
copper layers of each dye exposing the
silicon and he found that AMD is using
four functional Rison dyes there he is
right there that AMD is using for
functional rise and dies to create a
single thread Ripper chip the exact same
reason why same exact is AMD's epic
server processors are made the same way
that it's let's snake that looks like
this or resin that looks like they've
soldered the knot using just some crappy
Tim on there yeah it definitely looks
pretty pretty heavy heavy duty
he basically concluded from all of this
that AMD has the means to produce a 32
core desktop processor and that they
might have plans to release such a CPU
of course time will tell this is all
part of the rumor rumor mill going along
going around which I don't know why I
didn't put this in the rumor mill
segment which we're doing later but it
is kind of a it's kind of fun to
daydream about the potential of this
actually happening a 32 core desktop
processor from AMD
based on these raisin course potentially
their eyes and eyes so let's move on to
our next article though this is about
EVGA introducing their epower
v12 plus to phase extreme power vrm
motherboard this is an article from guru
3d this board has been floating all
around the interwebs today and it
essentially is to provide additional
power for your GPUs or your motherboards
in order to sort of maximize their full
potential and this is really for the
enthusiast crowd here it's designed to
provide two fully independent voltage
outputs and and several features like a
built-in evbot nk2
to allow for full voltage control
control on the fly these are powered by
three 6 pin PCI connectors the inputs
fed through like I said a 12 plus 2
phase power design which offers more
vcore and more v map vmm to your GPU
again unlocking its full potential
so this is definitely something like
perhaps your power might use I probably
wouldn't know what to do much with this
other than run some benchmarks with it
and nCWIT looks fancy we said we saw
this at Computex or the pre Computex
when we went there oh yeah that's right
I'm they were using it for for
overclocking King kingpin was using it
mm-hmm
fancy I don't feel equipped to use one
of those
yeah I would be wasted on me there was
no mention of release date or price that
is TBD in case you were interested so I
don't have that information for you but
we can move on to the rumor mill the
rumor mill where rumors are running amok
all over the place I think I think
actually you've covered this story too
I didn't know zine threes juicy 3sz 390
the support 8 core CPUs yeah this is
specifically buzzy 390 chipset which I
vaguely mentioned just just okay assing
okay more specifically about za 390
though all right so eurocom
representative leaked some info on the
z3 nighted chipset he said that it was
likely to arrive after the full stack of
300 series chipsets and will be revealed
early next year
in 2018 this is based on the same leak
though okay might be pretty similar yeah
the big reveal here again to just
reiterate the Z 390 chipset is designed
to support up to eight core CPUs this is
of course I would imagine to rival risin
7 family CPUs the eight core Intel main
stream processors might be the first 10
nanometer isolate silicon's so that's
kind of interesting
so I guess this is sort of you know the
question that we were asking earlier is
is Intel jumping the gun by releasing
ice lake so soon and is it because
they're sort of frantic and is this more
of a reactive launch where there may be
pushing there there embargoes earlier
because of the competition that they're
feeling or the heat that they're feeling
from AMD no pun intended
so say what's expected this year is LGA
1151 Coffee Lake CP used which will be
compatible with a new set of
motherboards with a Z 370 chipset yes
and we're expecting those in q3 or q4
this year we're in q3 right now q4 is
coming soon so the the weird thing that
this kind of brings up is like the the
timeframe between right now which we're
on 14 nanometer still it's a it's a
further refinement to 14 nanometers what
coffee-like is so 14 plus we had skylake
40 nanometer we had cabby like 14 an
amine and now we have coffee like 14
nanometer to hell with tick-tock after
coffee like was supposed to be a cannon
Lake which is supposed to be 10
nanometer a shrink of the existing 14
nanometer architecture but the existing
14 nanometer architecture has been
revised three times already like this is
the third revision that it's on so I
think the the question this is kind of
bringing up is is the time frame for
Intel shrinking between the launch of
Cannon Lake potentially if that's even
still going to launch on a desktop side
a nice lake which is following it up
which is a revision of the ten nanometer
manufacturing process or has their
timeframe and they're planning been so
thrown out of whack by Anthony's launch
of risin and the Nvidia is launch of
Bryce sorry Amy's much resin whoa whoa
my life is a quad beer
but has has that actually messed with
their time with their schedule and
they're there they have launched that
time frames so much as to the point
where they're just gonna skip Canon like
on the desktop and just come out with
ice Lake sometime next year which should
be fine with me
I mean Intel hurrying up their schedule
would be something that we haven't seen
all they've done is slow down their
schedule ever since they decided to
refresh as well with Devil's Canyon in
2014
does that I believe yeah 2014 summer
2014 that is Canyon that was the first
time they did a double talk rather than
going back to a tick where I stayed on
the same product the same node and they
did not and they just did a refinement
or whatever but anyway hopefully I was
info will we'll have more details on
soon yeah maybe so we'll be sure to
follow up at that but let's move on to
the next article which is about once
again coffee like there's a lot of
calculate rumors today okay the prices
were apparently listed in a UK store
this article comes from did you worthy
and so far all the pre-orders for coffee
leaked have been popping up pretty much
globally this is a British store that
revealed the CPU prices that actually
revealed CPU prices for that region to
be Wow
okay so for the for the core i7 8700 K
which is the six core 12 thread part
this is actually the flagship coffee
like CPU looks to be about 350 for
British pounds according to the retailer
site which equates to it's including VAT
by the way
including what tax including tax is 478
u.s. now bear in mind that doesn't mean
that the 8700 K is going to retail for
478 dollars in the United States this is
just the regional price for for the UK
or for this British retailer however
that is still pretty pricey if it were
478 it would be that that means it's
over $100 more than the last generation
flagship core i7 from Intel on the
mainstream side of things which is but
it's six core now it is six core getting
you're getting 50% more cores guys it is
six core but you could also get a risin
5 6 core CPU for around 200 bucks of
course you could argue IPC might not be
as strong but if you're doing core per
dollar type of thing that is a pretty
steep price to pay of course we're gonna
have to wait for the benchmarks to come
out and actually see what the actual
price is going to be in the US however
the the core i7 is this just goes down
the list go check out the article
there's pricing for at least six or
seven SKUs here it says 86 hundred K a
quad core now with hyper-threading or 80
600 K according to the article is a
six-course 6 thread part as well so it's
basically the same as cores it just
doesn't have hyper threading okay it
just doesn't have hyper threading but
that's gonna retail for 251 pounds
allegedly which equates to 339 us for
the flagship eye 5 ok which is about if
this were translated accurately over to
USD that means the core i5 for coffee
lake would be about the same price as
the core i7 flagship from the last
generation because I think the 7700 K
can be bought for around 340 350 there
abouts more or less since this weird
crossover where you have 6 cores 12
threads
6 cores 6 threads for coarse eight
threads like 6 for 6 threads 24 cores 8
threads which like those are the
yeah but where is the fork or a thread
see for you in the slide up is that
gonna happen there is a fork or oh there
is no fork or a thread listed
nonetheless we get is the core i3
8350 K which is a which is an i3
processor with 4 cores 4 threads so it
is not hyper threaded it's at a native
quad core no hyper threading but it is
unlocked so kind of like the 7350 k that
we saw with kb lake that's gonna retail
for 174 pounds or 235 us which is 5 but
again this is it could be regional it
still might retail for less than that in
the US but it's not a good it's not a
good sign though 225 for a quad or
thread when you can walk you can spend
less than 200 on an r5 1600 which is 6
cores in 12 threads yeah it's just yeah
like the gaming performance better blow
the rise and chips out of the water
somehow yeah for it for them to be able
to say yeah that's worth it cuz I mean
if you're playing pub G you already know
that you know you know to go AMD on this
on this issue well to be fair that the
the player knowns battlegrounds tests
which we discuss on my half of the show
we're all a 7900 X CPU that was had
cores turned off so comparing that over
its horizon I think is still probably
remain to be seen but hopefully um
somebody will will do all the legwork to
test that soon it won't remove but yeah
I mean and this goes all the way down to
the core i3 8100 for 115 pounds which is
quakes to about 155 us that would be a 4
core for thread part I believe as well
but yeah these prices are looking fairly
expensive compared to the competition
they're gonna have to really perform
well I think when it comes to gaming
specifically in order to justify these
prices
if yeah okay Intel's not gonna win back
the market share the CPU market share at
this rate if those really are the MSRP s
for these CPUs but I guess we'll have to
find out later when the when the
processors launch or when the prices are
officially announced next up we can talk
about AMD now we can talk about some AMD
CPUs particularly their rise in AP use
which were spotted in each bench
recently this article comes from PC
perspective yes yes Vega graphics so
it's got some bigger graphics on it this
is in particular about the Rison 5 2500
you ap you the you indicating that is a
mobile part and it actually scored a
single-threaded mark of 30 561
multi-threaded score of 90 421 again
this is in deep bench which pretty much
puts it 30 36 percent better single core
performance and 48 percent better
multi-threaded performance compared to
AMD the AMD a12 9800 which is based on
the excavator architecture and that's
partially I think what's - what's to be
thanked here for the higher scores not
just that AMD is now included SMT
simultaneous multi-threading for their
ap use but also the switch from the Zen
are the excavator to these then
architecture has also increased the
efficiency dramatically we're seeing
this kind of performance over the
Bristol Ridge ap use which are desktop
parts using half the power
so with these rise in ap use we're
basically using half the power but
achieving 30 to 50% better performance
which is pretty impressive so this this
is like the mobile equivalents of any
any any any AMD fanboy in the past nine
months who looked at the rise and launch
it was like I've already got an 8 core
8350 right like AMD CPU like I'm fine I
got any core whatever like this is just
this is this is another example of the
instruction per clock
performance improvement going from an
architecture that is at least five to
six years old if not seven or eight
depending on when you look when it was
first launched and if you're looking at
the revisions and refinements of it yeah
- now with the modern architecture of
Zen and the performance difference
between there but I'm I'm very excited
because I'm I've been I've been
interested in ap use from AMD that use
Zen and Vega yeah and this is the first
example of that exactly and they're
promising some pretty hefty hefty
improvements over the last generation of
AMD APU x' and according to the
Geekbench scores they're pretty close I
mean they're not bluffing it seems again
assuming that this is all accurate
information and they haven't been
pulling anything over our eyes but more
on that later I suppose our last article
here for the rumor mill comes from video
cards calm yes and this is a just a
really quick article gtx 1070 TI 1070 TI
is it a thing is good this just be a
glorified typo that was found somewhere
in the Asia's we don't know you can see
here from the picture no this is true no
one knows no one knows that's why it's
in the rumor mill that seems to be able
to confirm it it's been appropriately
segmented into the rumor mill again this
is a rumor 1070 TI with few more cores
rumor so-so hasn't 340 lures
yeah 20 304 CUDA cores speculative
speculative is it is it worth it what a
gtx 1070 TI makes sense this would be if
it did happen it would be the first time
into my knowledge since I was in the pcs
that there would be a TI version of a X
70 it's all right everything comes from
is this picture of a of a little flat
one of those little plastic plexi Flagg
pieces talking about the parts that are
built into a system I think this is
where it all spawned this is where it
all spawned I don't think there's
anything else there's no other and
that we have to base off base this off
my you know unfortunate opinion is that
it's it's a typo that's a typo it was a
ten 780ti strict so gee I think it's a
typo because if it if it was really a
1070 TI I don't think it would be an ad
board partner I think it'd be a founders
of Edition this early on you know what I
mean I think the the fact that it's a
Strix and it's a you know overclocked
one I think that it's just a typo it's
supposed to be a 1080 TI especially the
smoke so it's not something that they've
done before well it seems so out of
character 7d series with a TI on the end
that just it seems like a typo to me
yeah but it is fun to think about let's
just let's just sort of date your game
me that's like ten seven how much do you
pay for a 1070 right now for 400 450 400
to 450 some of the some of the really
high-end ones might be a more towards
500 right you can get a 1080 for 500
true yeah so where does a 1070 TI sit it
doesn't it of that it has no position
we're deciding what practical reasons is
Nvidia have for launching that products
what what what need is there in the
market for like man I the thigh gap
between Italy doesn't have the power I
need at 400 and I just don't want to
spend five hundo on that 1080 maybe if
you got a 1070 T I'd like for $75 that's
totally right whatever would be sold and
I will be sold yeah I'd have to say that
these it's a it's a very tight increment
that that that it would fill a very
small gap and it doesn't seem like it
would be much use to have something
between a 1017 to 1080 based on the
existing prices and performance but
there you have it you guys can go ahead
and speculate and I don't know I don't
know but you know you never know maybe
they do come out with the 1070 TI and
they change the pricing for the 10 maybe
they drop the price for the ten senses
so it's an intense
the anticipation of them like reworking
their whole products day perhaps okay
maybe it's a response to the
cryptocurrency mining and they've got
something figured out and they're going
off in left field and trying something
new maybe they just hired some intern
who you know used to work for Google and
he had this crazy idea there's no
about tech and I've heard I've heard
that ten seven dates you guys are
optimizing they can do like a hundred
mega hashes damn crypto man what if it's
a high end GPU specifically catered for
crypto mining yeah let's let's start
start that room rap I'm down leaked it
alright that's that's all we have for
the rumor mill before we get carried
away and start more rumors of our own
let's move on to our third segment here
which is face off thanks I assume that
either of these games work I just put
some links in here I think we've played
one or two of these games before just
click the first link and see if it works
if it doesn't we'll move on to the
second link if that link doesn't work
then we'll skip this segment entirely um
based off is a segment where Paul and I
faced off in a two one-on-one is a two
player game and loser has to usually
pound a beer or something like that
which I hope I don't lose because I'm
already pretty bust so we're gonna try
the tank trouble first I'll try tank
trouble and oh no O'Shea's we need flash
no that try the other one activate
flash see if okay activate engage oh it
works okay cool
we'll just play this one and you know
the loser will have to UM pound a beer
and I need another beer and loser has to
pound a beer and they also have to uh if
you get naked
Kaneko stream at least it'll only be the
second most embarrassing thing I've done
on stream o all month hey that wasn't
embarrassing that was like a moment of
transcendence you know I went camping
with a group of friends like some
distant friends they haven't chilled
within a while and I showed in that
video and they they all just like
started dying and they're like I'm
turtle you chose to all my friends that
way you were hungover yes I was super
hungover on Sunday it was I want to read
it was it was terrible
no they won't discuss it was the worst
day of my life alright alright this is
as well I'm ready to pound to be ranked
trouble
hey triple dip later that's it two
player button okay so I'm a es DF weird
why wouldn't they just do WS DM y know
because is you but why not I don't
understand whatever okay fine I'm not
gonna ask questions let's just do this
 going down you need to press Q I
did uh-oh this is where the bullets read
rebound and they potentially kill you
know in certain ways oh no wait wait
what are we playing - first time first
of five you want to first apply
something like that okay first of five
it is oh I'm such a aah
I'm terrible at this oh no this is
beginning who killed himself
first oh all right - no I was green I
know
no I'm green no I'm green no I felt I
felt myself doing that if I wait okay
the scores one two one
it didn't matter because we both if you
both died within a semester then wait
wait why should I
oh wait my guy's not shooting oh no no
oh you get you run out of you
should oh oh wait did that count no it
was a point where I have to survive you
still looking oh you've just survived
all of the bullets though so I'm I'm red
oh my god oh my god no no go away go
away oh my god I don't know
monkey stanley apparently okay I don't
like how long the bullets last if your
wifey sauce laughing in the other room

more games done playing games Paul okay
um we actually plowed through my half of
the show pretty quickly did so how'd it
big time but that's okay because it
gives us a bit more time to focus on
donations that were given
starting with Omar Omar marked in Delhi
for the $5 hi me again look up toe I'm
Satan to see what you were in for and
another excuse from even donating tell
us Satan it sounds like a trap and I
know what that means
Oh see only it up
lollipop oh it's an extremely spicy
sucker modeled after Lucifer's dick
penis toe I would guess ah that's a toe
it looks like a toe the world's spicy
I'm guessing that's what he's sent us ah
the 9000 whatever scope arrested toe of
Satan huh super hotter than sin nine
thousand nine hundred times hotter than
a jalapeno Scoville rating of 9 million
units that's over four times hotter than
a Carolina Reaper wait how it's like
using some chemical voodoo are you not
even like this is that even that's not
even like it doesn't even occur in
nature four times hotter than a Carolina
Reaper I'm not touching that I am not
touching that I will I will put it I put
my tongue on it I'll put my oh my god
there's like there's a toe of Satan just
like reaction was just with its inventor

would you do that alright thank you for
that Thanks thanks man and hello Marv
troll Mick trolling ttan for the 10
Canadian I'm sending you some American
pennies and forms of Canadian cash just
because Heather's faster than you to be
here and you spilled beer all of your
crotch seriously professional courtesy
brethren consider Oh argue with that
at all thank you very much troll for the
donation I appreciate it Cody Ford five
dollars how would he feel about the
female doctor hmm a cyberpunk 2077 ever
going to release graphics on video card
shrouds I don't know about cyberpunk
2777 it looks like a great game I hope I
think the same people who are doing
what's what's the developer for Witcher
project red do you project good yeah
project red is I don't know I trust in
the dev I'm pretty sure that they will
eventually come to market with
it's just you know patience is virtue
and all that graphics on video card
shrouds what does that mean graphics
graphics on pediatric shrouds means
graphics like like decals or actual
images it used to be really popular so
there's there's been sort of a I've seen
I've seen a decent number of like retro
unboxings recently going over like video
cards that came out in like the
mid-2000s and they had like these 3d
renderings of like a fairy or like a
warrior or whatever just on them yeah
and it was always that's exactly how you
can tell how good the graphics card was
and by the quality of the 3d rendered
image that was screened across the
actual Shroud of it what a great metric
of measurement
yeah how accurate um I think they should
bring it back
honestly it's something that that's been
missing for a while it's really a
statement thing when you buy a graphics
card and I am totally I'm fine with the
female doctor and I'm curious where they
go with it um see how that see how that
plays that yeah
thank you very much Cody though Ford
Overlord from the 10 bucks hey Kyle a
little something for making my day last
week haven't laughed that hard in a long
time
keep them beers spill Annette anything I
can do to appease the fans I will do so
that was a hundred percent intentional
not accidental whatsoever because I love
all of you so um you are welcome for
that intentional act of service uh let
it says it was Heather Heather Hansen oh
we got might be saucy or five dollars
honey please use this money to buy a
sippy cup for your beer I'm sure Paul
would appreciate it
love wifey sauce to be fair he mostly
just spilled on his own laptop so yep
you know my spacebar still a little bit
sticky from last week really oh that's
your May got everywhere like like my eye
and face were not the only casualties
effective my phone is still wigging out
it's actually better now but the there's
condensation here's from London station
look for the camera there's condensation
on the camera no all of the tweets are
all the photo tweets and Instagram posts
I've been making in the last 72 hours
they've all been on the
heather's pixel excel that I've messaged
myself and then is a little she just got
the Excel
she just converted from iOS to Android
for the first time in her life and she
loves it Excel is awesome
she's a true believer now in Android
excels the best yep she now has the same
phone as you Paul III couldn't believe
it she went like literally within three
hours she went from like being an iOS
user her whole life or not whole life
not like out of the womb or anything but
for the majority of her you know younger
years younger adult years to just
embracing Android for for what it is and
really enjoying it so I'm very proud of
her
but I digress let's move on to the next
one which is coolly
7 7 7 0 7 $10 thank you very much coolly
appreciate your honor your no comment
donation those are always welcome or
Aaron Aaron Lawrence five bucks
hey guys until they are GB built and
can't decide on a case new egg has a
white and black version of the course
here 570 X which one should I get um
really depends on your preference I
think if your full into the RGB thing
white the reflexive early that it
bounces it off a lot and whatever I've
done my classy RGB builds where it's
like mostly black with just the RGB that
sticks out so maybe I don't know I was a
big fan of my classy RGB build so so
maybe check that out on my channel to
take a look at kind of what kind of the
feel you can get from like a very an
all-black system but just with the RGB
glow that goes there but I feel like if
you really want it to like pop a lot and
be bright and stand out yeah go and go
and whites is a good a good way to
integrate the our jeebies yeah I agree
thank you very much Aaron a Cameron
Walker for the 5 bucks I want to help my
brother upgrade from his 80 320 and 380
I'm guessing our are seven there are
seven three and what would be your
recommended upgrade path for a 1080p 144
Hertz gaming situation 1600 GTX 1060
1600 and gtx 1070 SIGGRAPH
I would say GTX 1074 144 Hertz gaming
even at 1080p if you really want to hit
that
144 Hertz is you know that's pretty high
up there even for 1080p I would say a 10
1070 to cover a wider range of games to
actually perform at that resolution and
refresh rate / frame time if you want to
do like a like a step-up program - you
could upgrade your your your core
components first go with a motherboard
processor and memory because you're
gonna need to jump up to ddr4 you're
gonna need to jump up to you know you've
already got an AMD based system here so
jumping up to like an Rx or sorry an r5
1600 would be a nice complement for your
384 right now and then maybe you could
hang out just a little bit and sort of
see what your options are for monitors
and graphics cards in the next few
months but yeah like a 1070 is is a
great a great complement to that but
definitely a 1600 is probably where you
want to go on the CPU side I would say
yeah
thank you very much Cameron we've got I
$9.99 five dollars Kyle machination what
should I ask um Coke or Pepsi coke or
dope I don't really drink too much soda
and when I say Dr Pepper is it okay to
say Dr Pepper that wasn't the question
Paul
alright I guess I would go coke but I
really don't Coke or Pepsi and neither
of them are that appealing to me if I
had to drink a soda at one drink Dr
Pepper because it has 23 flavors 23
different flavors and you can never
quite pinpoint them all nope unless you
google it it's a mystery then you can
taste all of them thank you very much
I'm any trollman slowly mix against the
blood canadian this is for Kyle laughing
and screaming like a prison bitch from
balls being in his face Hey well as my
fate happens to us all I know they're
not balls my face
Jeff how zinger $5 shoot yourself in the
face with beer again and I'll send more
no well take your five dollars and that
will be all
yep I'm cool with five okay I'm a cheap
I'm a cheap date and that's pretty much
it for donations we've got okay I'm
sorry
Tom Brea's mitts Tom's presidents with
the 50 knock nor was at Norwegian no I
believe it's a Norwegian crota a regent
Crona while waiting motherboard from RMA
I spent two thousand knock to upgrade my
water cooling system still hoping for
our me about bent pin ah bed pins or
something I'm all too familiar with
especially recently with wifey sauce
damaging one of one of our motherboards
oh yeah I saw tweet about that that's
disappointing
it was fortunately it was a cheap
motherboard what happened was you know
the the the black plastic CPU covers
that usually come on top of the CPU
socket with a fresh motherboard she I
told her I gave her one of those and
told her to place it on the motherboard
the CPU socket flap and she actually
tried mounting it on to the socket
itself and pushing wording on time and
closing the thing like sandwiching the
cover between the yeah the flap and that
and the actual pins and so a motherboard
go bye-bye well that is what glass is
about mother that's probably a lesson
that she only needs to learn once
exactly she now she will never ever
forget it because she's been scarred for
life I gave her 15 lashings me too all
