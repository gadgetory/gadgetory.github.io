the channel hope you're all doing well
today is very exciting because the folks
over at fantex
have just released two brand new cases
they are the evolve shift and shift X
I'm going to be building my new htpc
inside of the shift today
it's actually the shorter of the two
cases doesn't have quite as much liquid
cooling support but still one hell of a
case as we're about to see so yes I will
be using this case for my upgraded home
theater PC that we will be building
today this is the current home theater
PC that wifey sauce and I have been
using for the last six or seven years
now
granted we made a couple hardware
upgrades along the way for example we
now have a Sapphire Radeon r9 285 in
here it's nothing super current but
definitely not six or seven years old
the initial or the original CPU is still
mounted however we've got a core i5 35
70 K Ivy Bridge quad core processor no
hyper threading so it's not a slow PC
but it's definitely not rocking like
current gen modern part so this will be
a pretty phat upgrade to say the least
in case you guys are wondering about the
chassis this is the silverstone sg0 5 a
fantastic mini ITX case that really just
boils down all the parts to pretty much
a smallest of a footprint as you can
probably get even by today's standards
so outstanding case but it is time to
move on to the evolve shift and we'll be
talking more about this case of course
throughout the rest of this video but
first the rest of the parts that we're
using for our upgraded home theater PC
my cpu of choice is the core i5 7600 K
KB Lake processor from Intel it's got
four cores no hyper threading but that's
totally fine this is more than enough
for what I need it for don't worry no
one stole the CPU it's just I took it
out of the box a while ago but it's a
fantastic CPU the reason why I'm going
Intel for this build and not horizon for
example is first all first of all I
don't need more than four cores for what
I'm going to be using this system for
which is mainly light web browsing and
streaming streaming services like
Netflix and Amazon Prime things like
that additionally there aren't many
fantastic mini ITX am4 boards out right
now I mean there's the biostar one that
I've already used it might go anywhere
do anything PC but it doesn't have Wi-Fi
I really wanted Wi-Fi for the upgraded
home theater PC because we've got Wi-Fi
on the existing one it wouldn't be much
of an upgrade if we remove that so until
those new boards roll out we're going
Intel it's going to be more than that
again for what I'm using this system for
that being said we've got a pre suite
motherboard here this is the ACS ROG
Strix Z 270 I gaming that's a mouthful a
fantastic board I've actually used this
before in the end case m1 build that I
did back in the day if you guys want to
go ahead and check that out it's a great
board it's got Wi-Fi on it
m2 nvme support and all that jazz it's
beautiful it's one of the nicest looking
Z 270 boards at this form factor in my
opinion so it's going to be fantastic
looking in this build also we've got
kind of a gray gray anodized aluminum
panels on the front and back of the
shift so I think that's going to match
really nicely with the board which you
will be able to see through the double
tempered glass side panels on that case
pairing nicely with an H 80 IV - that's
of course going to be our liquid a IO
for our 7600 K this is from Corsair it
does have fans on either side of it it's
a 120 rad I'm very curious to see if
we're going to be able to fit both of
those fans with this thicker radiator
inside of this evolve shift we're gonna
have to see I've got some other backup a
iOS in case that doesn't work though not
to mention the gray fan blades and
accents on the cooler itself are matched
pretty nicely with the rest of our
system including this Dominator platinum
kit 16 gigabytes 2 by 8 gig sticks these
are the 3200 kit but I don't think we
needed to go that fast so we're actually
going to be using these sticks which are
rated at 3000 megahertz thank you very
much autofocus pulling out all the stops
for our video card I've got the EVGA GTX
1080 Ti for the win
3 because we can this is not required or
necessary at all this is totally
overkill for what we're going to be
building today but it's fun we can do it
we're doing it because we can folks this
is a fully air-cooled triple fan design
from EVGA icx of course get that all
those thermal sensors in there this is
going to be a total beast of a card it
is fairly large for a dad and board
partnered 1080i so we're again this is
one of those things we're going to see
hopefully fingers crossed that it
actually fits inside of this case if not
I've got other cards for backup but that
should be pretty cool I believe there's
two eight pin PCI connectors for power
on here so we're going to need a pretty
hefty power supply to handle that such
as this 500 watt SFX L unit from
silverstone i've had this unit for a
while it's a t+
golde fully modular it's fantastic all
the cables that it comes with our flat
black so it should match really nicely
as well and very reliable have not had
any issues in my past experience with
that unit I should also mention that the
evolve shift that we're talking about
here only supports s FX and s FX L units
you'll have to upgrade to the shift X if
you want that full ATX PSU support one
of our last parts before we move on to
the case itself is this Patriot hellfire
m2 SSD I actually dug this out of an
older PC of the month with inside of the
enthu proach is also a fan text case I
totally overlooked the fact that I had
left this SSD just rotting away in the
motherboard there and a little m dot to
slot but here it is a 480 gig capacity
drive superfast so thank you very much
patriot for sponsoring this drive way
back when so that we can use it again
today and now last but not least our
case of the our the evolve shift from
fantex the anodized aluminum panels look
really sweet
they are super high quality a nice
finish and no sharp edges or anything
like that at all
this is again the gray version it does
come in black as well just gives it a
really nice stealthy look if you go that
route same with the shift deck so you
can get in either these gray or black
panels dual tempered glass again on
either side very high-quality looking
there it looks like they've got a slight
tint to them front i/o you pretty much
just got these two USB 3.0 ports
hovering at the back here I think fantex
decided to put them back there just to
tidy up the front look the appearance is
much more minimalistic with the ports
out of the way but they're still side
mounted so it should be fairly easy to
reach back there and pop in a flash
drive should you need to and you've also
got some nice ventilation at the front
and back so you can see the side
ventilation pretty generous pretty
pretty good ventilation at the top as
well I should also mention that this
case is can be mounted either vertically
or horizontally so you can actually lay
it completely on its side if if that's
the way you want to go gives you some
flexibility when deciding where to put
this in the living room or wherever and
I'm almost positive that you'll be able
to move these little feet should you
decide to orient the case on its side
additionally we've got a nice looking
top here very very sexy
kind of a big metal grill it looks like
there's a power button right here and
this looks to be I thought it was a
reset button at first but after looking
at the spec sheet I think it's an RG
button actually we'll test it out later
but there's an RGB LED right here or a
little strip right there which does sync
up with fantex compatible LED strips and
the RGB LEDs on your motherboard for
example that can all be controlled and
configured in programs like Asus Ora pop
this guy open you just simply apply some
pressure and it lifts up like so get an
accessory box right here very easy
access for when you first receive your
case everything's good to go right there
I want to give you guys a look at the
backside of the case so you can see
where the cables get routed out of so
there's a cable routing hole right up
here you can go out to you know your
keyboard your mouse monitors etc that
could all be routed out of this hole
right here or even out of the bottom of
the case vent X gives you the option to
route either/or or a combination of both
if you really want to this is also where
your AC power cord plugs in to
additionally I should have also
mentioned that instead of using these
USB 3 ports at the back if they're too
cumbersome or whatever hard to get to
you could probably just pop this open
the top panel which gives you access to
where your rear i/o would be technically
it's now your top i/o based on how the
internal layout works in this case so
you can if you wanted to just pop in a
USB flash drive straight from the top
assuming that it's short enough to not
interfere with this top grill so there's
a quick rundown of the cases exterior
let's go ahead and start building though
that way I can give you guys an idea of
what it's like to build inside of the
chassis and of course take a closer look
at the internal layout so got my
screwdriver all handy let's get to
building my new home theater PC alright
so the first thing we want to do here is
take off these side panels all four side
panels so we can actually start
installing things in the case the way
we're going to do that is we're going to
press down on the top panel so that it
lifts up like so as I demonstrated
earlier so it looks like each panel has
two thumb screws apiece so I'm going to
go ahead and start uninstalling the
right side panel it looks like they are
captive which is really nice because you
don't want to drop a screw inside of the
case and completely lose it so those are
those are loosened I think the way to do
this is you lift it
uh-huh just kind of lift it up like that
beautiful they came off really easy next
up we got this sucker
ha now looks like the thumbscrews for
the front and back panels are actually
mounted sideways as opposed to top-down
which is kind of interesting so as long
as you don't have super fatty fingers
you should be able to get in there
fortunately I'm able to unscrew these no
problem straight from the factory
usually for first time use you still
have to use a screwdriver on thumb
screws because there just tightens too
tight when they leave the factory but
this looks like it should be just fine
I believe this pops off just the same
way as the tempered glass panels do and
their last panel come off just like so
alright so the great thing about this
design is that it sort of offers you of
this 360 degree view of your open
chassis so it's going to be really easy
to just attack this from any angle from
any side and that's going to help the
build go along quite smoothly so that's
really nice I'm just going to leave off
the other side panels for now there was
something that I wanted to mention about
them though the front and back panels
the aluminum ones actually have
removable dust filters the best aside
dust filtration that I showed you guys
earlier those are actually removable
filters looks like they just pop out
like so you can run them under some like
a water faucet or just you know use a
can of compressed air or something like
that to clean them off maybe once a
month or so and then pop them back right
in they are plastic they look kind of
flimsy but you know fortunately not the
handle them too often so they should be
fine but that's that there's a removable
dust filtration system here now that you
guys have a better look of the inside of
the case you might notice that it comes
included with a 140 millimeter fan at
the front this is the only included fan
with the case and it's positioned again
at the front right next to the
motherboard and where your graphics card
will be mounted on the other side there
are mounting additional mounting points
for a 120 or 140 just but just below the
first fan and same mounting options at
the very bottom of the case this is also
where you would mount your your 120
millimeter rads either right here at the
front bottom or at the very bottom of
the case you can again I don't know if I
mentioned this but you can mount both of
them simultaneously but that will limit
your radiator thickness to 27
millimeters
on those rads so bear that in mind
alright let's go ahead and install our
motherboard now which you can see here
I've already mounted the CPU water block
of our a i/o onto the board itself of
course we'll need to mount that little
pesky IO shield first now you got to
remember that the IO is going to be
facing the top of your case it's going
to be facing up so it's going to mount
in something like that so we're going to
want to make sure that we install our IO
shields correctly it looks like that IO
shield is in and go ahead and mount the
motherboard to the four pre-installed
standoffs so you'll notice that the the
two on the bottom the two standoffs on
the bottom actually have a little lip a
little collar just to help you situate
the boards that it just sort of rests on
easy you also got to be mindful of the
the PCIe riser it is sort of in the way
so you've got to just hold it out like
so before your mount as you mount the
motherboard in there so
there we go motherboard installed
there's actually a cable management area
right here you can see there's a little
fold down door to conceal some of it
keeps it looking nice and tidy I'm going
to fold this little cable management
door down magnetic you can see we've got
some front panel connectors here tied
down with a included velcro strap let's
go ahead and plug in our USB 3 and front
panel connectors so here's a front
angled view I've just sort of started
routing some of the front panel
connectors like our USB 3 our power
switch etc I've also wired up the front
fan I actually wired it I ran the cable
through this channel here which gets
covered up really nicely with that
magnetic door and then I passed it
through the left side or the back side I
should say of the case because is where
all of the excess cabling technically
goes is underneath the front and rear
panels and fantex has done a real nice
job of including plenty of velcro straps
to hold those cables down so that you
can fit those side panels on pretty
easily and does a really nice job of
concealing them as well pretty much this
is all the cabling that I think I can do
for now I guess I could pass the four
pin fan connectors coming off of the CPU
AIO water block through the rubber
grommets there's actually two rubber
grommets in this hidden cable channel
here so that's really nice now since our
Patriot Hellfires the only drive we'll
be putting in today's system we won't
really be utilizing any of the other
storage options in this case but that
doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about
them so first off we've got two
removable mounts right here these are
two trays two and a half inch tray so
you can put a pair of SSDs here the
removable and they come off
they basically mounted these little
rubber washers so it's to lift you
technically have to use a screw driver
and physically mount the SSD to the tray
but once it's mounted to the tray it
just kind of pops onto these rubber
washers here we've seen this design in
other cases from fantex and other
manufacturers in the past so that's
really convenient on the opposite side
of this wall where all of your where
most of your cable routing goes all the
excess kay
in cable management you've also got a
single mount for a three and a half inch
drive or if you wanted to you could take
one of these removable two and a half
inch trays and move it to the opposite
side assuming you're not going to be
installing a three and a half inch drive
I think that's a pretty pretty fair fair
number pretty fair storage options for a
case of this size and form factor we've
also got this PCIe ribbon cable that
sort of leads to the opposite side of
the case telling us that this is really
divided into two chambers more or less
decide that you're seeing now with the
motherboard and CPU and memory and then
the opposite side with our graphics card
we'll take a closer look at that later
on alright so now we're ready to install
the radiator of our a i/o and it's a 120
again and this case does support to 120
radiators one at the front here kind of
towards the bottom of the front and then
one at the very bottom we're going to
opt for the bottom today because that
might give us a bit more room for GPU
clearance once that's in there so here's
a look at the bottom plate which is
removable in a very easy way you just
kind of pull it and pop it off but like
most front panels for a traditional ATX
mid tower and it pops off like so it's
very easy it's just got these four pegs
that fit into these four holes two feets
the feet that we saw earlier they are
they're long feet but they have two pads
per foot so here's two pads on one foot
here's two pads on the other long foot
and these are removable I can confirm
that now with the two screws on either
end just go ahead and remove those and
the feet come right off if you want to
lay this case on its side kind of like
how it is now there's also a removable
dust filter it's a nice little plastic
filter comes out from the side
underneath here we see a bunch of
mounting points just tons of flexible
mounting strips for 120 or 140 so we're
going to start off with our fan and
radiator we're going to do one fan at
first and then install the GPU and see
if we can get away with installing a
second fan for push-pull priority number
one right now is just getting at least
one fan and the radiator installed so
let's go ahead and see what this is
going to look like here try to block it
out
all right radiator and fan installed
pretty smooth we've also got our fan
cable here which we can probably route
through either this this generous
opening right here to the right of the
fan we can't actually route it to the
left of the fan simply because that's
where our power supply is going to go
which by the way we are blocking our
frigging power supply gosh darn it son
of a bitch so apparently I screwed up
guys I was supposed to install the power
supply before mounting the radiator in
here the order of operations in a case
like this it's just such a unique
internal layout is all it's all
backwards it's all upside down so do
this I can't I can't fit this in here so
I messed up I should have been reading
the instructions more carefully or even
at all the manuals like underneath that
box under the graphics card box I
haven't been looking at the instructions
so that's really my fault not fan text
in any way but it goes to show that you
know with a case like the evolve shift
you kind of have to forget everything
you know about building PC's because it
is such a unique layout and you really
have to sort of rely on the user's
manual for the first go otherwise you
could run into some snags such as this
one so on that note I'm going to go
ahead and uninstall this so I can
install this and then reinstall that and
then we should be good to go
alright so here we have the power supply
mostly installed it's kind of just put
in place right now
sort of difficult to get it in here with
the plugs because what the plugs
installed into the unit itself we hardly
have any clearance above this is about
130 millimeters long for a power supply
and we're just barely getting enough
clearance so it was really a tight fit
we still have to screw it in for now but
let's go ahead and finish screwing this
guy so we've got the power supply
screwed in now and you can see here
we've got a little pass-through at the
bottom of the case it's just long enough
to plug into the back of the power
supply don't forget to flip the switch
so the system boots properly when it's
time to boot and you can see the
pass-through goes to the rear of the
case I think we might have spotted that
earlier when we were taking a look at
the exterior so that's all pretty good I
mean power supplies complete for the
most part now we can go ahead and
reinstall our radiator alright so now
we're just going to do some cable
management so we've got all of our power
supply cables right here at the back of
the case there is a fairly large opening
a nice cutout on the back wall for
routing cables to there
appropriate connector so we're going to
start with our do our 24 pins get the
meaty guy out of the way first
see how easy it is to fit in through
this little routing hole actually I'm
going to unplug USB three header just
for now to get it out of the way and
sure enough our 24 pin seems to be
getting through just fine
here we go 24 pin installed next that we
can do our 8 pin EPS for the CPU a lot
now I have to bear in mind that the
memory stick still have to go in here
and they have pretty tall heat spreader
so let's install the memory right now
it's good to install the RAM especially
if you have taller heat spreaders on
your modules around the same time that
you're doing cable management because
otherwise if you install the memory well
well before that it can get in the way
and if you fell it too late then the
cables that you've routed will get in
the way of your memory stick so that
looks pretty good for now not much we
can do about this cable here what an
issue that you might have is that the 8
pin or any cables that are to the right
of the motherboard may interfere with
the front fan here because it's just
there's hardly any clearance between the
fan and the motherboard so bear that in
mind
fortunately looks like we're getting by
just fine here alright so now let's move
on to our video card the video card is
on the completely opposite side of the
case it's got its own little chamber so
we're going to turn this around so
here's a look at the graphics card
chamber and it's a pretty ingenious
design how they've set this up so
basically here's the the ribbon style
extension for your PCIe going to a by 16
PCIe slot which you kind of can't see
right here but it is right here that's
attached to this bracket that's sort of
on Rails and you can see here it's got a
flexible mounting strips you can mount
it all the way to the right or all the
way to the left in the center wherever
you want based on your clearance needs
the bracket itself is being held in
place by two of these screws here and
there's one standoff on the opposite end
where the cable channel is underneath
the motherboard so we'll have to get
back there in just a sec to remove the
bracket the other cool thing about the
bracket is that it's reversible so it
allows you to flip the card 180
whichever way you want so right now it's
configured in a way where the fans would
be facing inward
and that probably be the best for
airflow I would imagine but you can
reverse it
as I mentioned to have your your powers
I'm sorry your graphics card shroud
facing the tempered glass if you want to
get some nicer visuals of your card
depending on you know what your
temperature needs are what your thermal
requirements are and just your aesthetic
preferences I suppose so we're going to
go ahead and I think we're going to
mount it like this just for now just so
we can kind of see it through the glass
we'll see exactly how hot it gets when
it's mounted with the fans facing the
glass and how much clearance is left for
that so let's go ahead and remove this
bracket here this should remove just
like so easy peasy
now we can go ahead and flip around
since we want to do the opposite
orientation here basically the way you
do that is you take this little stand
off if you remove that and basically
place it on the opposite end let me go
ahead and do that really quick which you
will need like a wrench to do that
all right so now we can mount the
graphics card to the bracket got to make
sure that our little tab is downward
just like on a regular motherboard looks
like it's in there and we got to put two
screws to keep the card fixed to the
bracket all right
video card mounted to bracket now we can
install thing as a whole up actually no
we can't houston we have a problem so it
looks like we don't have quite enough
slack on our PCIe extension cable to
mount this card in this position without
it running into clearance issues with
our power supply there's just too much
interference
unless we were able to move the card
further to the front of the case slide
it slide it to the left but we can't do
that because this is too short so we're
just going to have to flip it the way it
was initially intended which is like
that so just really quick I want to show
you guys how we routed the PCIe cables
to the graphics card so from our power
supply here with the cables coming out
this end we sort of routed both of the
PCIe connectors through the cable the
cable channel right here in the middle
of the case and then we stuck them
through the bottom or the right side
grommet there's only two grommets there
so we stick it through the right side
grommet and then wired it directly to
the graphics card and fortunately there
was enough length on the power supply
cable to actually reach this is this is
a very large card and I should also
mention that it barely fit inside of
this case any longer it would have run
into clearance issues with the radiator
here we would have either had to swap it
out for a different a i/o entirely or
take a smaller or shorter graphics card
so fortunately it just barely fit and it
still looks really nice even though
we're not taking a look at the shroud
itself the backplate is pretty sexy and
kind of gives it a nice blackout vibe
compared to this side all right so at
this point since we don't have any
drives other than the m2 that's already
installed we're pretty much good to go
other than cable management so we just
need to tidy up the cables that are at
the back of the case make them look nice
and neat so that we can actually fit the
back panel back on without too much
trouble but I'm also going to throw in
this LED strip this is
actually a fan text branded LED strip
it's RGB and it is actually compatible
with the RGB controller on this case as
I mentioned earlier so we're going to go
ahead and connect it and the only thing
is that it's completely lost all the
adhesive the adhesive came off entirely
and there's no magnets unfortunately so
I don't know exactly how we're going to
fix this to the case here but I guess
we'll have to get creative alright so
we've got a bit of duct tape here it's
probably won't hold for very long but
just for the sake of the video so I can
show you guys the RGB controller later
on so here we've got our makeshift
adhesive which should temporarily hold
this in place okay we'll see how long
that holds for and I'm going to go ahead
and plug in the cable already plug it in
to our fan controller here last thing we
have to plug in for this build is the
RGB controller we meet we need to give
it power
just a little SATA connector I'm really
glad that it's SATA and not molex so +12
you fantex why are that guy up and this
is pretty much what we're left with in
terms of our as far as our excess
cabling goes this is it you're looking
at it it's just it's just this mainly
the SATA cable our USB 3 and some of the
you know the front panel connector stuff
but really easy should be really easy to
tie down again most of our cabling our
excess cabling is in this cable channel
here so plenty of space honestly even
though we didn't even utilize the drive
mounts here either the three and a half
inch or two and a half inch drive you
can kind of see the mounting points here
even though we didn't utilize those at
all I could imagine that you'd still
have plenty of room for cabling even if
you did populate those mounts in some
way so that's cool
got these lovely little velcro straps I
don't want to block our power supply fan
that's a no-no let's kind of wire things
up upwards
all right so cable management took next
to no time at all and it looks like
we've still got plenty of room to pop
our rear panel back on so let's go ahead
and do that as we approach the end of
this build there's hardly any clearance
between the back plate of the graphics
card and the tempered glass side panel
so I'm actually kind of glad in
hindsight's that we are mounting the
video card with the with the the shroud
facing inward I think that'll probably
be a little bit nicer on our
temperatures and now the final piece oh
wait I didn't clean the inside of it yet
 there we go there's a little bit
firm oh man this is looking nice and
baled complete let's turn it on ready
for it here we go
moment of truth whoa my goodness that
looks amazing
holy I can't tell is that blue is that
blue or white why I don't know why does
it look like this boys
well you know what honey this would be a
perfect opportunity to do an RGB demo
with the evolve shift and a compatible
fantex
LED strip what do you say let's do it
let's see what happens I believe this
button cycles through ten different
colors so that's definitely blue I think
the one before was just a white with a
very bluish tint next up we've got oops
let me go ahead and dim the lights a
little bit and that's pink for a fuchsia
fuchsia type of color we've also got red
I think if there were different colors
components there were different color
components in there that looks pretty
nice actually this is kind of like a
yellowish green and that is green that's
like a forest green
and then that's turquoise yeah there's
our teal so the other cool thing is that
you can I believe you can turn off the
LEDs if you hold the button down yep
you have to hold it down for a good five
seconds or so but the LEDs will disable
you can go ahead and press it again to
turn them on and I believe if you do a
long hold a long press is supposed to
give you different effects so now it's
actually breathing doing like a
breathing thing right Faden up and down
this just fades between all the colors
of the rainbow that's like the show
floor mode I think it's just static
after that point and of course you could
just do away with the RGB button
altogether if you wanted to by simply
routing the LED strip to an RGB header
on your motherboard should it support it
and that way you can configure all of
the stuff in the software whether it be
Asus Ora or similar definitely a reason
to pick up a fan Tex RGB strip or
something like that if you want some
additional bling and here's just a quick
look at the opposite side well it's not
quite as glamorous you can see some of
the EVGA logo here through the backplate
it's very it's very minimalist but
minimalistic but it looks nice
I believe that's also customizable in
the EVGA precision X software so you get
options you get lots of options and of
course the RGB light at the top of the
case is the matches the color of the RGB
strip and stuff so pretty cool alright
guys so there is mine YP sauces new home
theater PC it looks fantastic you guys
let me know what you think though in the
comments below as far as the evolve
shift awesome case for a hundred and ten
dollars I don't know if I mentioned that
yet but 110 MSRP at the time of launch
at the time of filming there's this
wifey sauce on your phone Annie but the
shift X is $50 more than that so you can
get that one for 160 I believe and yeah
worth every penny at least for the shift
I have yet to even open the box for the
shift X let me know what you guys want
to see with that case if anything in the
comments below as well but a very lovely
case very well thought out every inch of
space is for the most part utilized
quite well the cable routing in this
case is also just managed
very smartly the fact that you can hide
all the cables underneath both the front
and rear panels and this middle channel
here for routing all your cables from
the power supply to whatever components
that need to be routed to is very very
handy and it looks tidy too I mean if
you're just looking at it dead-on you
can't even tell there's just a cluster
of cables behind that little magnetic
door there so very good job fantex thank
you for making another great case but
guys let me know what you think of the
shift so far what you think about its
looks and its functionality as well let
me know what you think and also toss me
a like on the video if you enjoyed it
before you go feel free to check out bit
wit ultra might add free early access
channel for a buck 15 month the first
two weeks are completely free and you
can back out any friggin time otherwise
I'm Kaila big with thank you guys so
much for watching subscribe to the
