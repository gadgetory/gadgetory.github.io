and Sennheiser brings you into the game
with an open back design featuring
angled drivers for pinpoint locational

fold-down noise cancelling mic and enjoy
the long-lasting comfort of large plush

the drop before it's gone what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well today we are
assembling March's PC of the month which
is going to be a micro ATX thread Ripper
machine very excited it's actually my
first thread Ripper build in that form
factor so I'm super stoked and we have
an all-star lineup of hardware today you
guys should be very excited because it's
gonna be your treat I think it's gonna
turn out just fantabulously so I'm just
gonna start from the left my left and
work my way to the right it's gonna be
completely out of order all the parts
are shuffled around here on the table
but let's just dive right into the
hardware we're using starting with the
fractal design to find mini C this is a
micro ATX power of course and it's a
tried-and-true option I really love this
case it's got a tempered glass side
panel plenty of healthy airflow a nice
minimalistic design and a very smart
internal layout as well it does come
with some white accents on the inside
including some of the fan blades and
expansion slots we're actually going to
try to black out the whole system for
today so I'll be borrowing some parts
from a mesh if I see also from fractal
design and swapping them out for some of
the ones in here so we can get a nice
clean black aesthetic so super pumped
about that we've also got a WD 2
terabyte WD black hard drive down there
ties right in with our black theme of
course so that's just gonna be for
backup media and storage and whatnot
will be pairing that with a 256 gigabyte
OC zrd 400 from Toshiba this is an m2
nvme SSD for our boot obviously and
frequently used applications and one of
the big stars of our show is the
motherboard the x3 99m Taichi from as
rock this thing is fully loaded for its
size to be honest and there's really
hardly anything compromised here maybe
apart from the DIMM slots you're we're
only getting four dimm slots as opposed
to eight on a traditional x3 99 ATX
motherboard but for the most part this
thing is equipped with triple m2 nvme
slots we've got three full-sized PCI
Express slots there's 802 11
Wi-Fi and just a bunch of other stuff
dual intel gigabit lan and whatnot so
very excited to be using this board
today now cooling a thread Ripper CPU is
very important so I've employed the
enter Mac slick tech 280 millimeter a IO
which is supposed to be a fantastic
choice for the STR 4 socket especially
since the copper block that's being used
here provides full coverage on the risin
thread Ripper IHS so very excited to be
using that also I'll be swapping the
fans out for a couple freckle venturi
140 millimeter fans these with these
static pressure optimized ones nothing
against the included fans here I'm sure
they work just fine but this sort of
matches the overall design language of
the case we're using just that much more
of course everything's fractal design
and we've also got a 32 gigabyte kit of
Trident Z RGB from G scale this is ddr4
3200 speed this is probably a $400 kit
of memory alone and we're gonna be able
to fully populate the DIMM slots in our
micro ATX motherboard there so excited
to use that as well
unfortunately LEDs can't be black so I
don't know we might just have to turn
them off entirely which kind of wastes
the point of an RGB kit but whatever
we'll figure it out somehow moving on to
the other star of the show we have a
risin thread ripper 1950 X which is of
course a 16 core 32 thread behemoth and
I think the last time I actually touched
the CPU was with the yacht PC that we
filmed many months ago
so very much looking forward to putting
it in a bill today definitely is worthy
of being utilized in some fashion
powering our system is the dark power
pro 11 power supply from be quiet this
thing's an absolute beast it's very well
designed
80-plus Platinum certification 850 watts
has a very silent silent wing series fan
built right in and it's also got some
really nice black cables but just to
step things up a little bit further
we're actually gonna be using some of
these extensions from cable mod these
are their Pro Series cables and I really
like how these turned out I actually
configured these with their custom
configurator online and you can pretty
much customize any color length cable
comb color that you want so there's a
lot of flexibility here and the quality
is really top-notch so if you guys are
at all interested and checking these out
I'll put a link in the description below
last but certainly not least we have our
graphics card which is the Asus Strix
gaming rx Vega 64 which is one hell of a
card with a very nice custom cooler from
Asus made in-house
and it very well might be one of the
last Strix gaming branded AMD cards we
see if in videos GP P is really going to
take effect but of course that's a topic
for another video I guess we'll just
call this a limited edition card in the
meantime it makes me feel fancy but
that's pretty much it that's our
all-star cast of hardware for today's
build it should be pretty wild I can't
wait to see how it turns out so on that
note ladies and gentlemen let's go ahead
and start
alright guys here we have the build in
all of its glory it's looking pretty
darn nice I would have liked to show it
off to you guys with all white LEDs I
thought that would have been really cool
but unfortunately there's some issues
with the Triton Z RGB software not
playing nicely with Asus or a sync and
unfortunately I couldn't get both of
those apps loaded up simultaneously to
fiddle around with the LEDs so maybe
that's something we could revisit in
part 2 but all together looks very nice
you might have noticed that we did some
funny business with the tubing here we
actually tied it down with a zip tie
strapped it to the top of the case
routing it through couple of those
ventilation holes and it's just a little
bit lengthy for a case this size and so
the tubing was initially rubbing up
against the tempered glass panel which
doesn't look all that great was easily
able to fix that with a little zip tie
there you also might have noticed that
the GPU is getting awfully close to our
radiator which is why we have the fans
mounted on the other side of the steel
frame unfortunately that puts it the
blades much closer to the front panel
there's still a bunch of breathing room
there but significantly less than if we
were to mount the fans on the inside of
the frame so we'll do some thermal
testing in part two to find out if
that's really an issue if it is then I
do have an idea on how to solve half of
the problem quite literally is basically
just taking the top fan and mounting it
on the inside to the left of the
radiator technically we can do that
because that fan will actually be above
the GPU and it won't cause any clearance
issues and then finally we did have to
remove the drive cage in order to get
that radiator installed which meant the
only place we could really mount our WD
black was at the floor of the case there
are native mounting points for a three
and a half inch drive in this case for
that but it was kind of being blocked
off by the power supply since it is so
lengthy it's a huge unit so what I ended
up doing was just threading a couple
screws through the bottom ventilation
holes of the case and that actually
cinched down the hard drive just fine so
it doesn't look like it's going to pose
any long-term issues but just one of the
little corks that you have to deal with
when building inside of a small package
with all this like high-end hardware but
overall very happy with how it turned
out if you guys have any thoughts or
feedback on what you see here feel free
to blow up the comments below toss a
like on the video
if you enjoyed it you can also follow me
on floatplane for three bucks a month
you want to catch all my videos a week
early without ads I'll drop a link for
that in the description below
apart from that guys thank you so much
for watching have a good one and I'll
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
