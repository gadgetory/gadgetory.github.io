channel today I am undertaking a fairly
simple task that is long overdue which
is essentially cleaning out my closet
shout out to Eminem by the way and
replacing some of the crap that's in
here with a working testbed station so I
have a dedicated space a dedicated place
to test hardware and things like that
because right now if you look at this
table here this is where awesome
Hardware happens every other week it's
usually the one off to the side that you
can't really see on screen but it
essentially holds the streaming machine
as well as all the peripherals that Paul
operates every other week when we do
awesome Hardware streams at my house
however it's currently doubling as a
testbed area as well so anytime I want
to test a graphics card for example I
have to set up a whole other table so I
can put the testbed on top up and then I
have to switch out all the peripherals
that were connected to the streaming
machine and plug those into the testbed
itself it's just a really big hassle
that takes a lot of unnecessary time to
setup and teardown so I'm really looking
forward to doing away with that whole
method today in place of something a lot
more convenient and efficient and
there's a little bonus feature for this
video I am gonna be swapping out some of
the hardware on the testbed itself
particularly the motherboard and CPU so
we're gonna be swapping out the gaming
g1 Wi-Fi for the Strix x99 gaming from
Asus a very awesome little board it's
got RGB LED functionality all over it
with the built-in RGB header it's also
got you to m2 and things like that USB
3.1 type C and a we've also got the 69
50 X so this is the new core i7 10 core
chip from Intel it's really just making
sure that the system is top-of-the-line
and that it can really handle anything I
throw at it for RAM we're sticking with
g.skill however we argument swap out the
modules for a kit of tried NZ
this is their ddr4 of course at 3200
mega Hertz very fast stuff and I also
wanted to optimize my storage
configuration so instead of having one
120 gig SSD and a single one terabyte
mechanical drive for my games I'm
basically doing away with those and
replacing them with a single 960 gig
crucial MX 200 SSD it's just gonna be
really nice to have everything on one
single Drive it's also gonna make the
test bed a little bit lighter in case I
do need to haul it around from time to
time and last but not least we are
swapping out the power supply here so
currently I've been using a G Series
1600 watt
from Leppa which has been a great unit
honestly it's been super stable and all
however it's got this proprietary AC
cords that I've just grown to hate over
the years anytime I just wanted to use
any old standard AC cable so for that
we're swapping it out for a gigabyte
extreme gaming 1200 watt power supply
which is 80 plus platinum it is a
modular unit and even though we're
sacrificing some wattage here coming
from the Leppa I don't think it's gonna
be much of an issue because graphics
cards themselves are getting a lot more
power efficient as well as we're not
even seeing as much SLI support with
like three-way and four-way from the
folks at Nvidia so I don't think it's
really gonna be much of an issue 1200 is
still plenty for many multi-gpu setups
that I may be testing here in the studio
and on that notes ladies and gentlemen
I'm gonna go ahead and start swapping
out parts here on the test bed and then
make my way over to the closets where
I'll be taking all this stuff out and
putting all new stuff in and it's gonna
look awesome it's gonna be great let's
do it
what the hell that was but we're done
yay so here's the test setup looks
pretty good alright I guess we'll start
from the bottom and work our way up so I
got the test bed right here just
chilling it's a little bit noisy right
now because it's a fresh system fresh
install of Windows 10 new new
motherboard new driving all that haven't
really configured or tuned the fans for
anything yet especially the the H one
hundred-eyed GTX back there but there's
plenty of room here there was plenty of
room I did stick like I took a wrist
rest from this keyboard and I stuck it
in I stuck it through through this hole
on the other side of the test bed and
it's protruding out maybe about six or
seven inches right there but that's
basically so that the radiator on the H
100 I GTX can just kind of sit and hover
in midair without putting too much
strain of with the tubing on the water
block there so a little bit of a
macgyvering but seems to work out at
least for now apart from that I could
probably stand to tidy up some of the
cables what are you doing back there
cables why are you looking all in putty
I gotta clean up your act
camels so I might do some of that a
little bit later and then moving up here
we've got peripherals at least keyboard
and mouse I did want something with a
keypad so we went with the k70 non RGB
this is just the red LEDs one cherry MX
red switches I've had this one for ever
probably since it first came out but
it's still a really good keyboard still
works in a problem and the my onyx Nao's
7000 this is the optical version this is
one of the only two products I got
during prime day this year along with an
SSD but this is a really really
comfortable Mouse and it's the sensor
super nice as well so hopefully that'll
serve me well it's a little bit a little
bit limited on space here but I could
always move the the keyboard to the left
when the trace pulled out if I need more
mousing real estate and then finally we
get the monitor of course this is the
amount of price 4k panel that I've had
for quite some time now that was you
know used to be on the other table and
now you're probably wondering like what
am I gonna do when Paul comes over for
awesome hardware am I just gonna like
keep moving this monitor back and forth
from this table to the other one no I
actually have another panel ticked out
it's not a hundred percent for sure that
I'm going to get it it depends on a
vendor whether or not they want to give
it to me but it should be another 4k
panel that's probably better quality
than this one I would say it's
definitely a little bit more pricey but
if I do end up getting that monitor I
will be doing a follow-up video maybe
doing a quick little tour on some of the
main features of that panel in case you
guys are interested it's gonna be a
professional panel if it works out it
won't be a gaming one um however IPS
it's gonna look super sexy and all that
but for now this is gonna work out like
I was saying I think just having my own
dedicated space for testing hardware is
gonna save me a lot of time in the long
run and just speed up my overall
workflow so I'm really happy about that
overall I would call this a mission
success and most importantly I think I'm
just happy that all the clutter that was
once in my closet is finally cleared out
because that was a oh that's gonna
do it for now guys be sure to toss me a
like on this video if you enjoyed it let
me know what you think of my little
setup here it's not much but it does the
job I suppose
and feel free to subscribe to the
channel for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon have a good day everyone
I will see you in the next one
say bye banana bundling my banana</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
