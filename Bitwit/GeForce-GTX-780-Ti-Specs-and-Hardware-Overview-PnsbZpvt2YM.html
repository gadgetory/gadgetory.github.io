awesomesauce news today we'll be taking
a look at the gtx 780ti from nvidia now
this is their most recently launched
flagship card and it does feature the
same gk110 GPU as both the GTX Titan and
the GTX 780 which indeedy recently
launched and it does have a few beefed
up specs in fact almost every area of
specification it has been amplified
since the release of the GTX 780 it's
pretty much an unlocked a fully unlocked
and Unleashed gk110 so we're gonna take
a look at some of the spec differences
between those three cards as well as the
differences between this card and the
290x the r9 290x the AMD recently
launched you also get all of these same
features that you would with any 700
series card from Nvidia like a shadow
play GPU Boost 2.0 3d vision surround
and all that good stuff but essentially
i'm just going to be doing an overview
of this the spec differences and i'm
going to be releasing another video in
the future actually probably right
around the time this one goes up of
benchmark so you'll be able to actually
see for yourself if the seven hundred
dollar price tag that's attached to this
card is worth the performance increase
that you'd see over the
five-hundred-dollar GTX 780 for example
or the thousand-dollar GTX Titan which
i'm not sure why it's still out a
thousand dollars it's kind of outrageous
because as you will soon see this card
beats it in almost every test that I run
but with that said why don't we take a
look at some of the spec differences
between this card and the other two
gk110 GPUs from Nvidia okay so right off
the bat we can see a base clock and a
boost clock frequency increase from the
780 to the 780 ti actually the boost
clock of the GTX Titan ends right where
the base clock of the 780 ti begins at
eight hundred and seventy six megahertz
and then we get a boost clock of 928
megahertz still trailing behind the r9
290x at one gigahertz you do get more
stream processors on the 780 Ti than you
do with the Titan and that's once again
this is a fully unlocked gk110 so you're
going to get 2880 over the previous 2688
with the Titan 290x still still not too
far behind with 2816 as far as memory
goes you get half the amount of the
Titan frame buffer at three gigs three
gigs should be plenty I'm not sure if I
can release a four gig version of the
card but that'd be pretty cool even
though you have half the amount of frame
buffer as the Titan you do have a faster
memory clock so the effect of memory
clock has gone up from six gigahertz
with both the Titan in the 780 27
gigahertz with the 780 ti you also get a
bandwidth increase for your memory going
from 288 point 4 gigabytes per second to
336 and memory interface remains the
same across the board with the nvidia
cards of 384-bit trailing just behind
the r9 290x at 512 alright so here i
have my gtx 780ti and alongside it the
gtx titan for a relative comparison
right off the bat you can see the
coolers are pretty much exactly the same
with a few minor differences one being
the painted aluminum fin array now
painted in black as opposed to the more
traditional just chromed out look of the
unpainted aluminum fin array there with
the GTX Titan as well as with the 780
and most graphics cards for that matter
don't usually paint their Finn arrays
I'm not sure why Nvidia decided to do
this maybe they just got tired of the
old traditional look they wanted to
match this part of the shroud I'm not
really sure but I don't think it affects
performance either way so it doesn't
really bother me one aesthetic change i
can see definitely why they made was the
painting of the engraved branding of gtx
780ti now painted in black so you can
see it a lot better as opposed to the
titan and 780 you just couldn't really
see it all that much and you know part
of having a badass high-end card in your
system is to be able to show it off to
your friends and you can easily do so
now with this new painted look slide
from that oh yeah look at this the pcie
gen3 connector it's black right there
and it's brownish orange right here not
exactly sure why that matters Paul
pointed out to me and I was like oh
there's a difference I was just I was
just pining for differences between
these two coolers between these two
cards and that was pretty much all I
could come up with everything else is
more or less the same still uses the
vapor chamber to do your thermal
dissipation it's got the same blower
style fan that will eject air out the
front as well as the back of your car
through those ventilation slots the rest
of the shroud is pretty much enclosed so
you're not going to have too much heat
dispersed inside of your case which is
always nice is your a look at your pcie
gen3 connector once again over here
you've got some power connectivity your
6 pin and 8 pin pcie connectors I would
recommend a 600 watt power supply for
this card there's a geforce gtx branding
in green which also has the green LED
behind it lights up and illuminates and
looks really cool SLI fingers for up to
4 Way SLI with this card so if you want
to kill some games go ahead and do so I
highly encourage it take a look at the
pc
eats I've got a kind of a glossy black
finish looks almost identical to the
Titan once again except the Titan of
course has that massive amount it's got
a six gig frame buffer once again so
you've got all the memory modules on
this side of the PCB there on the
opposite side of the PCB for the gtx
780ti so you don't really see them but
you can kind of see where they would be
surrounding the GPU right there the
gk110 other than that the the PCB looks
more or less the same and last but not
least let's take a look at the video out
so you've got two dual-link DVI ports
one digital one digital only it's your
DVI I digital-only and your digital and
analog dvi-d port right there both
dual-link hdmi port DisplayPort video
outs and this is a obviously a 2 slot
card design and it's a forget how long
this card is I don't have a ruler on me
which is pathetic I think this is what a
10 and a half inch card but yeah it'll
fit in those cases that's a very
educated guess Kyle it'll fit in most
things but there you have it there's a
look at the hardware for the gtx 780ti
alright guys that is going to wrap it up
for this overview once again this has
been invidious latest flagship car the
geforce gtx 780ti featuring the
unleashed gk110 GPU and if my benchmark
video is up right now go ahead and check
that out if you haven't already and let
me know what you think of the
performance numbers the results are
pretty expected given all the specs that
we've gone over today compared to the
other cards it's going to be no surprise
that this card beats out a lot of the
other competition on almost every test I
run but still fun to see nonetheless and
let me know out of the top three cards
on the market right now as far as
reasonable cards Emily I'm excluding the
titan because it's a thousand dollars
and it's out of the question completely
ridiculous but out of the 780 ti vs. the
780 as well as the r9 290x which card
would you go with given All Things
Considered really all the features that
you get on both ends whether it be
mantle and trueaudio on AMD side or GFE
shadowplay and GPU Boost 2.0 a bunch of
other things on invidious side given the
price given the performance All Things
Considered which of those three cards
would you probably be willing to go with
the most and I'm really curious to know
so let me know in the comments section
below in this video or the benchmark
video and um yeah pretty exciting stuff
new card yay I think you all for
watching this video please like it if
you like this content and dislike it if
you think I'm failing at life and be
sure to subscribe to awesomesauce news
for more tech videos if you haven't
already thanks for watching guys I'll
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
