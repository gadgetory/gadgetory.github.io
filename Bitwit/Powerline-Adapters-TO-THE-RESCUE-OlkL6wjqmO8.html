guys just look at how awesome it is it's
just there's like papers on the floor
wifey sauces desk with a bunch of crap
on it look at this big-ass TV look at
that it's not 4k but who cares for case
stupid there's a lot of cool stuff you
you might you might even say it's the
perfect living room but it's not you
know why you know why do you see
something that's a little bit out of
place something that's not quite right
guys well I'll tell you you probably
can't see it because it's on the ground
so today we're solving this problem
there are these two Ethernet cables that
have been strewn across my living room
for the last two years or so coming from
a an AC Buffalo router and going into my
office of course where where it's hooked
up one of those is going to hotline
which you can get a perfect view of
right from here and the other one is
going to the streaming system for
awesome hardware on Tuesdays now the
reason why this is an issue now wifey
sauce and I have had a big-ass rug
covering this up for the good portion of
two years and it was it was great you
know you hardly ever noticed it unless
you like went over to my my area and
then it would start to get a little
seedy but that's that's all changed now
because we got rid of the rug it's just
a little too big for this space ever
since we moved her desk in here and it's
just Shaggy and hard to vacuum and it
sucks so now we're dealing with this
mess and whyphy sauce ever since has
been very adamant about me getting rid
of these cables which I fully understand
it is quite annoying and sort of an
eyesore so that's what we going to be
doing today I've got I've got an idea
though guys
I don't think all hope is lost just yet
this is what I'm going to do instead of
hardwiring which I'm not going to go
wireless
before you freaked out because I don't
want to sacrifice that much in terms of
internet speeds but I've got these two
products here the first of which is this
Ethernet powerline adapter from tp-link
this is the AV 500 nano offering 500
megabits per second which is pretty
speedy and if you guys haven't used one
of these before these are super
convenient
it essentially uses your home circuitry
to transmit your broadband signal this
particular unit comes with two of these
wall adapters and they both so they both
plug into the wall one of them connects
router and the other one connects to
whichever device you wish to have
internet on and and it's pretty easy
just plug and play uses like again the
the circuitry that's in your in your
home walls and stuff it's like voodoo
magic and there are super convenient but
I'm going to also see if there's any
sort of performance slowdown using these
over a hardwired connection I've never
really done a sort of a bee comparison
with these particular units before so it
should be kind of interesting now
unfortunately this product only supports
one device and to add more devices I
would have to buy an additional wall
unit actually one per every device that
I wished to add to the little network
here and that's kind of a pain because
it's going to eat up a lot of my wall
sockets which I don't like and they're
just sort of bulky I don't want three or
four of these in my office it just just
not very convenient to me so instead and
could get kind of pricey too so instead
I bought a switch so here's another
tp-link product here
this one's 200 megabits per second I
hope that's enough internets for my
needs we got the 10 100 there and the
switch is a pretty simple to explain
just really briefly it's like you
connect your router to one of these
ports and then you've got this is a five
port switch and then I've got four
additional ports that I can just feed
out to other devices so this is kind of
already doing the job of one of these
guys if I were to buy an additional one
but it's even better because it's
cheaper in the long run and I've got
four ports to work with instead of just
one per unit it doesn't take up nearly
as much space either so we're going to
be setting these up today it should be
fairly easy to install these are all
super easy like plug and play devices
and we're going to be doing some AV
comparison testing these are the speeds
I was able to achieve that I'm getting
now on hot line with a direct wired
connection so here we have 118 megabits
per second down a hundred and or I'm
sorry eleven point eight nine up and
we're going to see if there's any sort
of speed or performance degradation once
we switch over to the new hardware let's
see what these puppies are made of
alright ladies and gentlemen
installation was a breeze as expected
look at this no more cables on the
ground whoo much cleaner
it just feels feel some nice feel so
nice to have a clean living room with
with no cables tangling us up you can
see here got the router still situated
and the powerline adapter is plugged in
very close to it right data underneath
our little printer desk there and you
can see I've actually plugged
directly to the wall socket as opposed
to using the electrical outlet that
would have been closer maybe a little
bit more convenient you should probably
never plug in your Ethernet powerline
adapters into a surge protector or power
strip of any kind simply because that
can scramble the signal and I don't mean
like encrypt it but I just mean there's
a lot of interference that's introduced
when you do when you go that route oh my
gosh my microphone
my poor lavalier are you okay like I was
saying these surge protectors can
severely impact your speed so if you
happen to pick up a kit similar to this
one you're getting really lousy
performance for some reason it could be
that you plugged in to a surge protector
so always always go the recommended
route and plug it directly into the wall
however there's a few other factors to
consider if you are getting some lousy
speeds with your powerline adapter which
we're going to go over in just a bit
let's go ahead and mosey on over to my
office and see the other let's see the
rest of the setup here that I've got
configured I'm just going to walk in
here just do it just do it on the fly so
I plug in the other adapter right there
so I've routed that to our switch here
and from there I've got a couple a thern
net cables going outs of course one to
the streaming pc the other to Hotline
and i think that it's pretty much simple
it's super straightforward I think at
this point we can do a little bit of a
comparison test I actually hooked up my
my go anywhere do anything PC in the
know 202 and which is on Wi-Fi right now
I did a really quick speed test just to
see what we are getting with Wi-Fi and
we're getting 52 down and 11 up okay so
not not too shabby the download speeds
about less than half of what it was with
a direct wired connection to hot line
which was about a hundred and eighteen
down if I remember correctly so we're
going to see with our with our new
configuration here with the powerline
adapter is to see what kind of
performance we can get so let's just
click go see we get hopefully we get
better than Wi-Fi I'm hoping for well
above 50 megabits per second down and it
looks like we're getting at least that
and potentially more we're at 60 pushing
70 yes
8000 I don't think we hit 80 all right
we're doing up now
Ãºp seems to be about the same as it was
with the hardwired connection which was
around 12 looks like we're getting the
same deal here which I'm very happy
about I'm actually almost more concerned
about upload speeds and download speeds
because of YouTube and stuff but here's
here's the final results with our
powerline connection down of 78 megabits
per second and an up of nearly 12 so ups
looking good download we did incur some
speed loss there from 118 to 78 that's
kind of a that's kind of a bummer
actually but here is the other thing
that I wanted to test out the other
factor to consider here that might
impact our speeds is which outlets were
plugging these units into so I mean
obviously there's not much I can do
about this one I mean that units going
to stay there because it's right next to
the router but this one over here I feel
like maybe we can get it a little bit
closer to that first socket so that the
signal won't have to travel as far a
distance within my home circuitry so
there's an alley right here right
between the wall and the couch of our
living room so that's that's good both
outlets would be in the same room so
potentially that could increase our
speeds a bit but I honestly have no idea
so let's go ahead and try it out it
could very well be the same or worse I
don't exactly have like a wiring map of
how the circuitry in this house is is
wired but let's let's just go ahead and
try it out let's see what happens
all right I've relocated the second
adapter we plugged in behind the couch
now in the same room as the router and
the other adapter and let's rerun the
tests I'm I'm hoping that we see
something a little bit closer to the
original 118 megabits per second that we
saw let the direct connection but let's
find out moment of truth
okay come on pushing 50 pushing 60
come on 70 75 looks like we're beating
our old score we've beaten our old score
were hit we've hit 80 80 83 85 88 oh my
god was that almost 90 I think I saw
almost 90 and then upload speeds looked
pretty consistent here let's wait for it
to finish
oh my god my my heart is racing I can
feel it beating out of my chest this is
intense guys I'm going to cry
all right here we go eating it so
basically 90 down and upload remains at
12 what do you know just simply from
switching it switching that second that
second adapter from that port right
there to the one directly behind this
wall was gave us gave us quite a nice
boost there so I'm pretty happy with
this I feel like this is maybe a 1520
percent or more slowdown from a direct
wired connection but the convenience
that we now have of not having to trip
over these cables which wifey sauce does
all the time - she's super clumsy is
it's totally worth it honestly and
because I'm uploading honestly these
days more that I'm downloading I bet
this sits well with me so I'm very happy
with how this turned out although I
wonder what white pea sauce thinks about
it care how I got rid of the wires all
right so certainly good to have YP
sauces approval in the bag happy wife
happy life and all that I'm really happy
with how this turned out actually before
I go a bit of information you guys might
find interesting I actually reran the
speed test with though someone's glare
on the monitor good lord did I even did
I even look at the shop before I started
filming I actually ran the speed test
again with one of the adapters the one
closest to the router plugged into the
surge protector to see what kind of
impact it would have on our speeds what
kind of performance hit we would incur
and it actually dropped the download
speed to 30 megabits per second going
from 90 to 30 a massive hit just from
plugging it into the surge protector so
if you're having any issues with your
powerline adapters maybe check that out
to ensure that you're not just freaking
out and you know having to return the
product unnecessarily but
that's all the time I have for today
guys thank you so much for tuning in let
me know what you think about my setup
here I think that the the the
performance decrease here is is slight
enough to still work for my needs I'll
be watching watching it closely and if I
notice it's too slow then maybe I'll do
a follow-up video and try to improve
things but for now I think it's going to
be just fine let me know what your own
experiences are with these powerlines
Ethernet adapters or Ethernet powerline
adapters I know it's kind of a mixed bag
of reviews on the internet and stuff so
very curious to hear your thoughts on
the subject but that's going to do it
for now guys thank you so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to the
