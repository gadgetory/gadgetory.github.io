before show that your comments no one
that looks like so like so I already
handled it right you're like we're live
Kevin we are live hello welcome to
awesome hardware episode 159 this is a
live tech news show where myself my good
friend and colleague Paul Paul's
hardware that's me like to stream this
show every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time right here on twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware as well as our
respective YouTube channels this week
the first half of this show is streamed
to my channel if you've got comm /c /
bit wit I have a C in my url because I'm
special and you are not it's because of
the name change in about an hour or so
shut up Paul will be switching over to
Paul's channel youtube.com slash Paul's
hardware his URL does not have a seat no
it doesn't because he's is relevant and
olds that maintain the same channel name
entire time consistency is Bob like
consistent snot key anyway thank you for
being here we like to we like to do
stuff on the show like talk about
technology so celebrate a strange okay
it's been it's been a whole week since
we did this last yeah no I'm still
reading my thoughts I always forget how
to do it okay I'll just go into like
random just normal Kyle mode and we also
have beer we like to drink lots of beer
on the show if you're of legal drinking
age please drink along with us today we
we've been graced with the the presence
of Milk Stout nitro from left hand
Brewing Company has an amazing beer know
your board hard port hard Paul for her
all the way hard yeah yes got for a hard
pork just thank you very much for
foreplay this beer at Paul's delicious
first and thank you guys for for
dreaming with us
you can't drink alcohol then just you
know he's sad
we appreciate it if you're sad and not
drinking with us like alcohol is an
option you don't have to drink up good
alcohol is mandatory so for all of you
alcoholics out there cheers Cheers
welcome to awesome hardware 159 we also
sell stuff like the bottle opener that
Paul is flashing earlier you can head to
my store bit with tech and you can buy a
variety of merchandise like like shirts
and hoodies and bugs and pint glasses
and bottle openers and mouse pads other
desk mats and spinners Kyle can I get a
fidget spinner no oh okay there's still
there still up there
no they are still within the first
little me - there's two left
you can fight - are you sure that's not
just a minimum that water just that's
somebody who knows my store is Paul's
Harbor net hey you gotta buy stuff thing
anyone who buys a fidget spinner on this
show will get a double Johnson
without having to actually buy anything
from Paul still really trying to clear
those eyes then you can't you couldn't
do that I just did it is I feel violated
double chance to make I'll feel better
about the the promise that I just gave
you guys head to his store as well
Paul's hardware net yes where you can
find also a great selection of these
merchandise the pub glasses that were
today or very or very sturdy you can get
a glass table and opener
both together which means I sent you can
open the beer list and then you can
drink the beer mm-hmm good idea
yep very good ideas and that's pretty
much it for intrigued do we have any
announcements today we do have one
announcement aha we're gonna be doing
some traveling yes
pardon me and the upcoming week so next
week we will not be doing awesome
hardware correct as well as the week
after that double correct so we're gonna
miss two weeks our apologies but we
traveling but there's a flip side to
that that that I think will be good so
you know there's reasons things happen
so we'll miss you guys but we'll be back
I don't think we're gonna try to do any
live-streaming during the travel might
be kind of tricky so we're not gonna
promise anything like that because every
time we've been like we're gonna
livestream from Computex or whatever
like we never do yeah and we feel that
so we'd rather not make the commitments
and instead of let you guys down but
there's a small chance that might happen
but don't
don't you know just assume that there
will be no show for the next two weeks
until further notice also I guess
disclaimer we occasionally square or use
curse words on this show adult language
so you've been warned if you have
children running around that's only for
virgin ears adults only yes it's not
like a dirty kind of show don't get the
wrong idea
we're not gonna like strip down in the
middle of you know that it's just
occasionally there's a racial splurt a
slip of the tongue
no I'm joking there's never been ever a
facial surface I just I just I just
wanted to throw you guys off technically
your some of your accents could be haha
those aren't slurs those are those those
are accents am you in in honor of those
sellers eyes self-deprecating I guess
self-deprecating because I am a victim
of half those accents that I do but also
because they're hilarious that's mainly
why I do them so I guess maybe they
could be racist but I don't think they
are people are just easily offended all
right let's move on to our first segment
here which is the rumor mill because we
have a few allegations these are quite
leaks all but I guess you could say
they're leakage there's no there's no
mill in the rumor mill
here no no no I commit that at your
place in there yeah why is there a globe
or like part of the earth like bunch of
lights because probably there is a mill
somewhere in that part of the earth all
right I'll take it there's got to be a
mill some variety in that shot if you
were to zoom it you have to zoom in it
hints okay okay sound logic is usual
Paul thank you all a minute all right so
let's let's talk about the first rumor
of today which is about Intel's ninth
Jenny apparently allegedly launching
October 1st I thought we were guaranteed
at launching in August but I guess that
wasn't the guarantee because I was also
a rumor so apparently it's been pushed a
rumor a whole month or so to October 1st
this is from WCC of tech the the sources
are saying that it's gonna launch on the
1st of October it's gonna include three
unlock SKUs on the day of launch so
that's exciting there's gonna be the
core I 999 hundred K which is an 8 core
16 thread chip that's going to be the
flagship of the family the i7 9700 K
which will be the successor to the 8700
K now but it'll have two more cores at 8
cores and eight threads again these are
all rumors so grain of salt here but
previous rumors were indicating that the
9700 K would have six cores and twelve
threads very much like the like the 8700
K but now WCC F Tech's new sources are
claiming an eight core eight thread
count so you'll get more cores but fewer
threads because you will not have hyper
threading what are you doing with your
one hand beneath the desk Paul it's very
suspicious on stream to all of our
viewers kind of concerned myself raising
rates it's except it's an exciting story
I mean is there another warning we
should add too
adult language warning at the beginning
of our show I told people we wouldn't
strip down and like it wasn't a dirty
show now you're kind of kind of making
me look like a fool what happens under
the table stays into the table that
looks freaking hope so for the love of
all children there and God okay and then
there's the I 5 9600 K keep going I'm
almost finished okay that's good I want
to say I hope so but then again I'm like
no don't finish I'm not shaking your
hand for the rest of the day the 9600 K
will be successful to the i-580 600 k
will feature six cores and six threads
also not hyper threaded some rumors
about the 9900 k the flagship chip eight
core 16 thread part that a lot of us are
really excited about it will feature
allegedly 16 megabytes of l3 cache a
base clock of 3.6 gigahertz a single and
dual-core boost to 5 gigahertz that's
pretty impressive
a 4 core boost to 4.8 gigahertz and a 6
or 8 core boost to 4.7 gigahertz
officially making it the highest all
core boost clock in mainstream Intel
history is Intel gonna write is in
tuggin list those actual boost clocks
individually for us and promised them
and are they going to list tvp's for all
those levels have to be what I'm curious
about that is a damn good question as
far as we know we don't know but we do
have some sort of rumor oh that's also
speculating a 95 watt TDP just overall
but again that could that will
definitely change based on the type of
boost that we're getting in the 9700 k
once again eight course eight core eight
thread part will have 12 megabytes of l3
cache presumably and a base clock of 3.6
gigahertz a one single or dual core
boost to 4.9 for core boost to 4.7 and
the six are all core boost to 4.6
gigahertz will again a 95 watt TDP all
three of these unlocks cues that will
allegedly launch on October 1st will all
carry a 95 watt TDP including the i5
9600 K again six core six threads which
will
hr9 megabytes of l3 cache a base clock
of 3.7 gigahertz a single core boost of
4.6 gigahertz a dual-core boost a 4.5
gigahertz it's the only SKU in this list
that has two separate boost clocks for
single and dual-core speeds 4.4
gigahertz boost on the four core turbo
and a 4.3 gigahertz boost on all six of
its course so it's like it's I have to
wonder in actual benchmarks how much the
their their decision not to go with
hyper-threading will affect performance
between these two and it's also it's
it's weird to see an i9 on the main
stream like they just brought that to
the high end you like the Skydeck stuff
and it's also weird to see the i5 and i7
there the i7 in particular without hyper
threading that is weird
that's been I feel like it's been a
standard food for them for quite some
time I feel like the i7 should still
have hyper threading and the i9 should
just have more cores and threads with
hyper-threading I could have seen them
doing the i9 9900 K as the 8 core 16
thread and then the 9700 K is a 6-quart
thread yeah and then exactly 9600 K is
646 thread but I mean but instead it
just seems like they're now making the
i9 just like the i7 was yeah you know
what I mean
and now the i7 seems more like an i5 in
the sense where it's not getting hyper
threading support I'm looking for them
to get up into the I double digits like
the I 11 well I'm like a I 17 like the
i-17 I'm not really gonna be something
to look forward to until an AMD releases
their something I had my end there my 18
you know and then it gets really
confusing like it like it should they
should overlap all that code names like
everything should just be completely
confusing and difficult to figure out
which which company and brand you're
actually purchasing from AMD why like
the way ndy like core i9
yep totally many ideas so I don't know
you guys let us know what you think
about these rumors October 1st it's
right around the corner maybe a little
bit further back than we thought and if
you guys are wondering about when 10
nanometers popping up that's presumably
been pushed to 2019
q4 24 2019 what a lot of people are
saying well initially it was gonna
happen years ago and then it just kept
getting pushed back it's getting pushed
back further so we're still on the 14
nanometer plus plus this time it'll be
40 nanometer + + architecture because
Intel slow moving on though we have
another article about Enzo yay
a lot of rumors around team blue today
about its ex 599 chipset with its 28
core processors meaning the high-end
desktop platform that it teased at what
was that the show was a sick no no
that's context copy dad Computex there
overclocking their overclocked demo that
they didn't mention was overclocked was
teasing their next generation high-end
desktop platform we now have this is
another board these yep that's the mobo
we now have speculation from HD
tecnológica calm which is a Spanish
Website I want to say and basically
they're saying we have sources that are
saying this is gonna be the ex $5.99
platform is what the official name will
be apparently we don't have they didn't
really go to details on how they got
that like they didn't really say like
these are our sources or we had a source
or we just found this out organically or
what so there's very little to go on
here so again getting assaults a Spanish
site so they would say no I keys
cincuenta porfavor
the wave a new wave I don't know how to
say 500 in Spanish oh and senior
cincuenta no new sink Lipton live in
know every nowhere in the wave then
we're venting wavey uno dos tres cuatro
Cinco seis siete Nueve yes maybe until
you don't say cincuenta noventa e
venting wavy this is see to choose get
us thank you to chill event in the way
of event anyway which I think I think
it's what I said it's in Quentin event
in New Haven a kiss
cincuenta no veteran waiver no noventa
event you see a kiss acquaintance know
that
how do people speak Spanish no no do
they do it it's to the great very a very
versatile
tug that thing yeah a smart brain gotta
learn to roll the arse and stuff all
right all right so uh listen this is
song you get off tangent gracias is what
we're trying to say yeah yeah so this
new platform will also allegedly use the
LGA three six four seven socket which is
the first socket in a while that has
left the 2000 series so there's more
than there's there's way more than two
thousand pins now yeah on this this new
socket again if this is all true a lot
of a lot more gold contacts that's
that's good that means more performance
hopefully LJ that's a really just random
number like 20th 2011
2066 those are very easy numbers to
remember
LGA 3647 it's just like they just picked
a number out of a hat
well that had a it can't walk on their
keyboard number pad that's exactly
that's an existing socket for the for
Xeon processors oh you're right yeah
okay then this is probably all too
familiar for I mean that that's let's
say when they made the socket for Xeon
processors they pick the
that out of a hat that's true Italy
there was some reason when it comes to
the like technical technical engineering
of this processor where they were like
we need exactly that many contacts
33,000 647 but cool I mean I I this is
this is like my reaction to the 28 core
thing when Intel did it at copy text and
everything gets they deserves some
scrutiny for the way they did it and
some sort of that stuff that they didn't
mention about the demo and everything
right and certainly right now you know
as of yesterday
AMD a shipping a 32 core processor and
where's the 28 cores that Intel was
demoing and Computex you know where to
be time a Andy announced the 32 core at
Computex when they announced I confirmed
it
yeah it's available for sale now yep
Intel announced this 28 core nowhere to
be found it it's not available for sale
that I would say that is sort of a AMD
would kind of win on that one
yeah but that said I would be excited
for Intel to be like alright the
high-end desktop space is a space you
want to compete in you know the
enthusiasts stuff like it's it's it's
it's always like went back when Intel
first launched like X 58 in that
platform like I was already on the lower
platform and as it was just this sort of
achievement for me to get up to when I
write and my first like i7 920 and and
everything so yeah
so upgrading it to something especially
like like the like I feel like the
physical just just the physicality of
the socket with when you look at
threader bird and it's bigger and it's a
slightly more complex procedure
generally isn't just sort of that next
step up to the in the in the enthusiasts
face that I enjoyed a lot
there were loves I appreciated about it
and I've been very positive about three
or four so yeah Intel coming in me like
alright this server socket we're gonna
now make a consumer version of um you
know that there's some do he said about
that that said and I covered this a
little bit in my Computex videos when I
interviewed Noctua and Jacob was talking
about and he was like the installation
procedure for this socket is not easy
it's not simple or threaded four or four
notes are it for this Eon socket it's
made it's made for like system
integrators to be able to install and in
like a like a production line to some
extent mm-hmm but there's also like when
it comes to translating that to a
consumer experience there's a lot of
potential possibility for damage when
you're doing an installation right so I
would be curious to see what you know if
they're gonna actually change the
mounting method maybe that'd be
interesting to see but and I think I
think what I'm curious to see also is if
Intel with this newer with this next
generation of their high-end desktop
platform if they're gonna try to compete
with the Ripper on just the performance
scale or if they're actually gonna
compete on a pricing scale too because I
feel like that's where Intel really
falls behind right now at least for my
federber to review I found that like the
79 60 X was outperforming the 2950 X in
most of the tasks but it was $500 and
more expensive so like five hundred and
fifty by that I mean it was like fort
it's like 1450 I think yeah right by
that yeah exactly at least for the time
that I was looking at prices and stuff
so one of those things were I don't know
if Intel has like where they stand when
it comes to pricing if they're gonna be
like oh yeah we should definitely is he
removing the camera he's oh he's very
close and he's licking his paws right
now so he the cameras movie it's his
heroes his back muscles might be
doing it like I can't really tell it
simply wiggling the cable woman oh my
god sorry guys this is Hiro he's if he
actually starts pushing it seriously
they're gonna do something about it it's
it's sandbag dam nothing I'm not too
concerned about it I know yeah it's good
thing to have a sandbag on that thing
good a sandbag on here oh you thought
the framing wasn't quite right so you
okay DP here oh yeah so yeah I would
like to see the the price competition
start to get really competitive I guess
you know Intel they might be like we're
in tow we're not gonna stoop to AMD's
level and sell our amazing chips for
their prices like people will just buy
our chips even if they're way more
expensive because we're in tow and we're
a household brand didn't all that shit
so I don't know if you look at sales we
looked at these a little bit last week
if you look at sales of the current
generation products since since I
launched it towards the in the last year
it's been doing well yeah like they've
been doing well I have you know I've
done some builds with with the Intel
stuff recently but like I usually swing
towards AMD just because I'm like look
you can get a six core 12 thread
processor for a hundred and yeah 50
bucks right you can get an eight core
for sometimes as low as 200 maybe maybe
a little bit more than that like yeah
that's there's so much power there if
you're talking about doing anything to
sense you're strictly gaming so that's
kind of where I lean right now but um
you know Intel has a reputation yeah and
they have been on top for quite some
times that carries over and you know not
everyone watches our show or keeps up
with the with the right ongoing progress
of technology and what's good and viable
so so yeah yeah I don't see them like
drastically cutting their prices or
anything like that but I mean
competition is still competition and
having options one way or the other I
think is good so yeah and I mean if you
look at core counts they have
lowered their prices to some degree I
mean if you look at what sure they were
charging for a ten core two years ago
yeah and what they're charging for a
tank or now it's come down quite a bit
so yeah all right moving on though to
our next article from tech power up this
is about the alleged r-tx 2080 the
next-generation GPU from Nvidia
successor to the GTX 1080 this article
is well first off we're gonna talk about
talk more about this on Paul's house yep
but this is just a quick little article
about just sort of speculating on what
the new reference cooler on the r-tx 20
in the picture would look like and it
looks just like the MSI cards it's like
they collaborated with MSI for the
reference the upside and and sad to say
they're still going with red you know
that they they will not be swayed nope
just no foxhaven even even doing an
Nvidia alright now this we're relying I
hope you guys are guys are joking it was
a joke
that's just a road I don't know why the
picture there anyway it's just kind of
weird it's a graphics card with two fans
yeah sure yeah and that's and I think
that's what we're getting at here is
that there's some speculation that the
r-tx 20/80 may have made it the single
blower style fan that we've grown to see
and I would say love but that would not
be accurate on a lot of these reference
cards and it would ditch that for a dual
fan design very very much akin to an ad
board partner card so the reasons for
that is that after we had some leaked
pictures of just a raw PCB of what could
potentially be the r-tx 2080 people were
looking at it trying to dissect it and
stuff people who like can just look at a
PCB and like know a thousand things
about the card already
I definitely can't build to be a great
example people like that we're saying
you know this looks like a relatively
more power-hungry card or definitely a
less power efficient card than the GTX
1080 was with it's you know very very
nice 180 watt TDP and a single eight pin
power connector that's not what they're
getting these impressions for by looking
at these pictures of this piece
be this PCB shows a six plus eight pin
configuration with the ten plus two
phase setup and up to 10 V GPU and 2 V
men phases which you know I don't even
know what the phases would be on the GTX
1080 off the top of my head but I would
assume fewer and Eddie's awesome playing
every time and I want to play this every
time you talk about phases where they
talking about CPU power delivery or GPU
power delivery of phase the phase and
one implementation is not the same as a
phase another implementation the
components can have different amperage
ratings different power delivery ratings
so you can have you know I don't know
any values off the top of my head but
you can have it you can have an eight
phase-- configuration that can provide
just as much power as a sixteen Faceman
thing right it's not the end-all spec
the third how powerful a thing is
positives and negatives stay the way it
says right adding to this theory of the
board being unusually hot potentially
bench life info Chas a Chinese website
mentions up the cards reference design
cooling again would potentially have a
dual fan design over more conventional
aluminum fin stack so that would be kind
of weird because I feel like the
founders of dishin card if it did have a
similar design like wouldn't that
compete slightly with adding board
partner cards if the cooling was was
better if the card was less noisy from
not having a single blower fan all like
a lot of the things that people buy ad
board partner cards for would already be
implemented into the reference design
and I'm sure like NVIDIA sold a shit ton
of founders Edition cards once they
announced like the founders additional
card because they didn't really ever
sell their reference coolers or the
reference cards beforehand before the
founders edition or at least they were
harder to get or they would only be sold
through their website usually you would
have third party manufacturers who would
acquire
any of their brand oh yeah they would
either just put stickers on it or they
would be at the actual you know sub
manufacturer of the reference designs
themselves right so you could
potentially get it that way but the
founders edition was first time they
were like we're gonna charge more money
for the founders Edition and then yeah
that didn't last too long yeah but like
so so the blower's style design and like
the single fan with the exhausting on
the heat at the back of the card design
to me has always been sort of like a a
design geared towards mass production
and mass implementation across a huge
number of system integrators yeah like
business build systems that are designed
to sort of have a certain level of
airflow and everything and writing them
like tolerances and all that kind of
stuff so like at least and they did they
did a lot of pitches of that especially
with like smaller form factor systems
with the original founders edition
design and just saying like you know you
have this here and then I can get its
own intake of airflow and it doesn't
affect the other mm-hmm you know
components in the system with the here
but so you know there's value to that
design right you know should that be the
reference design because the open style
coolers can cool a lot better I mean
that's right that that's able to be
proven pretty objectively yeah so to me
them deciding to go with an open dual
fan cooler design just means that they
want to go with the reference design
that can get the most performance out of
the card sure
versus the most like utility slash
performance right what's right with
respect to the entire system yeah and I
guess there are still things that could
be improved upon a reference card that
has like an open shroud dual fan cooler
for example they could be fuck the power
delivery there's also like the whole
aesthetic thing I feel like aesthetics
plays such a massive role in what
components users buy these days that
that's definitely gonna I interested to
see vidya which like I hope it seems
like if that's if this is true at all
that they're sort of doing a complete
redesign of the reference cooler yeah
which I've been kind of looking forward
to for quite a while because they've
been using the existing sort of style of
design for the cooler since the I think
the GTX 690 versus was when it was first
introduced the magnesium you know silver
with the vapor team's laid on top that
can see through the thins underneath and
then and the blower style yeah
the 690 the the fan was in the middle
and it rejected both ways right and then
maybe I think was the 700 series that
where they move the blower to the end
and then the air yeah yeah so yeah
that'd be cool
I'd be interested to see what they would
come up with since they have to create a
design that's you know universal enough
that it can be put in a lot of places
IIb I'm also kind of curious to see if
they're still gonna put a like a a green
accents that is an unavoidable without
modding on it because that's the biggest
limitation yeah I feel like for you
here's the other big question but
probably the biggest question the most
important question of all is will there
be RGB on the reference cooler
will there be RGB lighting there's RGB
lighting on the stock thread upper to
cooler the Wraiths Ripper so I would be
totally okay if Nvidia created a
relatively color neutral design for the
the actual cooler itself yeah and then
have an Nvidia whatever Jeep if they
want to put GeForce GTX or RT X or
whatever it's gonna be that lights up in
green but that is also our GG that you
can change the color on if you want to
that right that would make sense to me
and could turn off if you wanted to if
you'd like I hate lights yeah light this
light is bad
I prefer that I live in the dark if the
shadows okay so I guess again again more
more on this stuff on Paul's half you're
upsetting them I'm more on your mark
moron you're a moron it's a good bet my
busy yeah alright thank you guys for
sending these in I got a really late
start on their submissions so sexy Wow
look at that
yes I made that I made that probably my
life's greatest achievement and we've
completely phased Matt Philly out now we
don't even mention him anymore I know
but you know what shadows and out Philly
that's it

those Noctua fans not to us those are
the LTTE brand i believe no no they're
not
oh I thought this orange that's more
ground never mind the industrial these
are way better with this industrial and
the redux I think he's got both redux
yes he does I think the redux are they
reframe yes and they on dust really or I
use this for the silver bill very clean
build overall cable management is ace
sir a sir
no not a burping sorry
oh so that's I think the hell'd you eat
for lunch
sorry alright so what I want to say here
is that the cable management is 10 out
of 10 for the most part and then you've
got color coordination 5 out of 10 5 out
of 10 maybe even 2 out of 10 what come
on
I mean there's yellow on the power
supply there's white on the motherboard
and there's brown on the fans silver on
the fans and what looks to be maybe blue
or white I guess I guess that could be
white on the
if you want but there's a lot of colors
going on here and there are all kind of
muddy colors okay so there's a lot of
muddy so there's a couple quick fixes
these these little corner pieces from
these these not to offense they have
replacements I can swap them at some
more black ones yeah
they might even maybe with maybe just
remove your power supply sticker yet on
the side here yeah remove these top ones
while you're at it if you're gonna go
ahead and do that
you should I've been just and then and
then you're fine what's no yeah no yeah
just just those things I didn't say it
was a complicated fix in the current
stage for having a five or less I think
I feel like it may be a six six point
five but yes those that those are the
only things that are standing up nice
build it would be cool if those redux
fans are white yeah
spray paint them white just do
everything I say everything away cuz I'm
the voice of reason
yes and then maybe use some cable
trainers on your on your cables on your
extensions maybe pins the the GPU yeah
three Teddy yeah but overall very clean
build thank you very much sir CID mixing
we got Hector Hector Hector TX 970 EVGA

C XD that's 340 z I don't see anything
wrong with it so everything it's looking
yeah it's great
this is gold let's get it zoom in just a
touch yep just a tad here I you know get
a nice man across there's something
about this build I can't quite put my
finger on it
you know the like this this Corsair all
of them liquid cooler I feel like the
side piece on here could be reversed
maybe I mean I guess you could like pull
that off and maybe spray paint or spray
painted blue to match the EVGA oh yeah
yeah that would really clearly really
been quite new
didn't be all suck totally all set
apart from that maybe another SSD down
here at the bottom to match so you could
have you know see the cable right there
so clearly that wouldn't be an issue
right there so you could but is this
plugged into it that's probably cooler
[Laughter]
chutes and ladders I feel like I'm
looking at the big games of that that
games like a Rorschach test or something
like what right yeah what are you
actually looking what you see in this oh
my gosh there's a my future to cloud you
know there's a wizard
he's calling my name
so this is this would win an award for
the worst kill management ever featured
on and fit my PC yeah pause I were
briefly looking at this before the show
thinking like is that is that is this
actually is everything actually plugged
in like any of these cables just I
thought it planted I thought are they
actually being used being you as a troll
he just like threw extra cables into the
system but yeah there's seem beached
like this is the SATA cable right yeah
going down there right there's another
SATA cable here where does it go
I don't know right maybe there's another
drive behind there and the fact that he
like look at his 8 pin CPU it's just
pretty quickly can we get some more beer
yeah please do the cpu I mean I mean
what why do I even know there's not even
any point to point out like one
particular cable issue because all the
cables are just the wreck but I feel
like if you cleaned up the cable
management it would be perfect
technically technically there's only one
problem with this PC of another stout
that sounds delicious technically
there's only one problem with this PC
but it just happens to be a really
really big problem so fix that one
problem and you're good
anything else really though I mean any
nitpick works
this looks like an NZXT case based on
the case fan and the I recognize those
expansion slot covers and the power
supply basement yeah you definitely yeah
back there for King Landsman you have no
excuse hurting people's eyes sandy hair
watching that oh wow that cameras a
little little tweaks let me fix it
Oh happen in the meantime a little bit
oh no this page exists someone moves or
tweak a meld oh man look Imelda all
right so my mei-ling we we tried to use
your link but for some reason it didn't
work I'm getting the same error on my
system so it's gonna commit come gamble
down candle nail all right what do you
got
you've got the horizon 2200 G oh we got
an 81 here
hello Raven Ridge asrock be 350 pro for
16 gigs of engines corsair ram lpx novo
nest 120 millimeter CPU cooler that's
new and a 256 gig micro and m2 SSD
inside of the Thermaltake Versa h18 what
is the liquid cooler what it says up
here which is actually the brand of
sleeved extensions that I've been using
for a lot of build builds lately up here
up here no I believe it's a Chinese
brand I've been using their extensions
they're really good quality really good
quality but I've never used their CPU
coolers I mean I didn't know I didn't
know that they made CPU coolers but I've
never actually take a look at one and
this looks cool I mean it's kind of a
nice looking water block it's different
yeah and I thought it must be quite at
first because just how it's all it looks
to be like all lowercase
big wide block big wide block like it'd
be quiet cooler but it's a nice looking
cooler interesting how it says appeared
like sideways like you couldn't amount a
bit right so I would I was gonna say
maybe ever if he rotated that 45 degrees
90 degrees I'm sorry
ha ha the mud on that mountain seemed an
interest rotate 90 degrees and you maybe
would could loop the cables around a
little bit more and lift them so that if
you did add a graphics card to this
system which is really what I feel like
it's missing definitely like I don't
know I feel like when you've added a
liquid cooler you can get 120 millimeter
liquid coolers for 50 60 bucks so I
guess it's not that making the
difference but um but yeah this really
wants a discrete graphics card is what
you want to add and it wants a ditch
that hideous power supply sticker yeah
get rid of the power supply sticker
cover it with something nice to are
doing any favors
some sleeve extensions so if you're a
fan of if you're liking your up here
cooler yes
get some get some sleeved extensions
from them because they're actually
really really good quality just make
sure you know which type you're getting
because they sell two different
materials
there's the paracord sort of like the
plasticky ones that are a bit more stiff
and then like the more like a fabric
nylon like or I guess the nylon ones
would be the more plastic bands they
usually the plans now a paracord he
records you with the fabric so make sure
that you know what you're getting but it
would look a lot better in your rig and
you've also got this m2 SSD which is
fine but it's green the pcbs green maybe
I could cool around that or so it's no
put it a little heat sink on there or
just plastic get the shit out of it yeah
sure as long as it doesn't have any cool

as the result of a seemed like a good
idea at the time ten-foot mod
net PSU its upgrade well now I've done
this one 14-foot mod 10 foot mod is one
as a mod that looks good from 10 feet
away but you get it closer up and
maybe not so great so yeah I've actually
done this before actually one of my one
of my test beds down there I will have I
wrapped the ketchup and mustard
I used gaff tape though which isn't as
reflective as electrical tape I'll sure
I feel like the electrical tape that I
mean there's different electrical tapes
right of different qualities but I feel
like the actual resident the sticky
stuff you know kind of like it doesn't
last as long especially in an
environment like a like a PC that heats
up right so yeah he's obviously already
kind of regretted that over time and is
aware of it but you know it's it's not
looking super great like I don't know
what looks worse this or just this this
ketchup and mustard cables
I think the ten-foot mod on the graphics
card is also not a GPU I mean that's not
a ten-foot mod that's just plugging it
in with what you have available know
which is the red paint on the ground oh
the red paint let's get rid of paint on
it it's a mod though tech does not make
a card with those minutes I get it it's
to match the red on your case and stuff
alright but there's there's there's
definitely some modification here that
seems a bit more amateur and I'm not
gonna fault you for it because it
probably looks better than had you not
done the mods to some degree but there's
better ways to do those I think instead
of taping your 24 pen ATX cable I would
say get some extensions get some sleeves
extensions and that would also fix the
mustard that's all over your graphics
card - it's an EVGA 5 inter watt power
supply so don't worry that's one of the
budget EVGA Paris was there tore a
perfectly fine Paris didn't even get a
really cheap extension set the
that that looks great that looks fine
yeah it's way better than what you have
or you know there's 50 $60 power
supplies that have all black cables sure
that would have the proper cables for
your graphics card as well so you
wouldn't have to use a molex adapter it
would be a lot more time swap that out
but be it be aware you'd have to redo
all your cable management swap out the
graphics card versus adding notice what
about the power supply I'm sorry to put
the pair of slifer's he's letting
extension cables yeah
only slightly only slightly I don't know
no no no okay maybe because he is it
doesn't get reroute think most of the
major cables anyway if you're using
extensions it also depends on how he's
got it routed behind the case yeah but
at any rate I think extensions or a new
power supply would would do wonders for
your build because everything else looks
pretty clean it's interesting how you
have your fan cable for your CPU cooler
wrapped around the fan I mean it blends
in pretty well oh yeah I would
personally just tuck it underneath the
fan if you could yeah that would look
better yeah it's such a nice looking
faint cry where you actually spend some
time spends time making their fans look
good and then we've also got what else
here that's all that's it okay it looks
really good apart from those minor
gripes
thank you very much Jacob Thank You
Jacob thank you all for submitting to
pin my PC and thus concludes the segment
let's move on to tech news
first I'm gonna point out that I'm
drinking a new beer from Al Smith new
Booya drink fresh in a pint glass 45 to
50 degrees that's a good that's good
what is it a session meal this is an
American session ale it's a good session
called Mount Rushmore mmm which is
fantastic me and Bill crushing it all
right what's up next
yeah rolling these news stories
relatively quick because we've were
somewhat short on time here and we
stopped to do donations so first article
here is from hot-hot-hot Hardware about
the crypto currency seems just kind of
going bust right now saying starting
with Bitcoin Bitcoin has fallen as low
as 59 hundred dollars in the past 24
hours before climbing back to just over
6,000 at the time this article is being
written so in the time that it took this
dude to write this article if the price
of cryptocurrency Bitcoin sorry
fluctuated from fifty to fifty nine
hundred dollars to six thousand which
doesn't seem like a lot but in 24 hour
period $100 swing is quite it's quite
volatile very stable code this is super
volatile stable and back in May if you
remember Bitcoin was training at around
10,000 dollars and even topped $19,000
it was almost $20,000 in late 2017
20,000 and now it's like 6k you're lucky
if you get 6k it's actually down 68%
from its record high which is really sad
until you look at aetherium which is
doing works going on with the theory
Imperium just crashed to a nine-month
love to around two hundred and fifty-six
dollars yes it surpassed twelve hundred
dollars back in January of this year
fluctuated wildly through early May and
it's been all downhill ever since
at the same time last year theorem held
32 percent of the entire cryptocurrency
market cap with Bitcoin just barely
beating it out at 39%
but now the theorem is only carrying 14
percent compared to bitcoins 54 percent
so what about all those people's a lot
of percents but those all those people
who are heavily invested in Bitcoin who
are like bitcoins gonna be worth $50,000
by the end of the year that well you
know that they are all now selling their
GPUs on maybe they had a vested interest
in bitcoins price continuing to go up
god help those people because it is not
looking that way as of now so Bitcoin
and aetherium are essentially worthless
now and you're going to lose money if
you if you have any of them so just send
them all to us basically yes and if we
didn't want to be evil in that sense we
would tell you you know there's a chance
there's a chance that cryptocurrency
could gain back some of its steam and
then I use could go up again this is
very volatile market so who's to say
where it's gonna be a year from now or
even a couple months from now we don't
really know but at the very least miners
thousands of miners globally and
especially here in the United States are
kind of jumping ship and we've seen a
lot a lot of used graphics cards pop up
I have personally on Craigslist and
other second-hand sites from miners
miners who were just like you know it
it's not it's not taking off like I
thought it would and this is also
evidenced by the lowing lowering prices
of mainstream GPUs having looked like
this week but like I know 10 80s could
be had for as little as four turn above
40 50 40 down to 400 I haven't seen 400
but I saw a picture yeah I know it made
the choice between 1070 1070 TI 1080
very muddy because like as soon as
you're at 10 70 bucks
they got 20 bucks more for sin 70 ti
okay another 20 bucks maybe 10 20 bucks
more than that for it today yeah yeah at
that point if you're spending that much
money on a GPU then it that extra bit is
is a smaller percentage of the total
cost that you were spending so so it
makes it more worth it
so it's interesting how just within less
than a year the tables have completely
turned 180 when all the miners were like
hell yeah raking in the dough
everything's awesome I love life and
gamers are like I fuckin hate you life's
horrible I got to spend a thousand
dollars for a gtx 1070
and now it's a total opposite story
miners are jumping ship selling your
GPUs oh my god I'm like totally Brooke I
spent 20 grand on GPUs I know I made
like five grand back
and then now gamers are like rejoicing
everywhere like holy crap we finally
have normalized prices for GPUs so it's
it is what it is but being gamers
ourselves to some degree when we can and
being a tech enthusiast in general I'm
happy I think I feel that it feels good
to be able to make a simple
recommendation he'll give her like a
reasonably priced yeah PC builds with
that I'm gonna go into like an
explanation of like all right graphics
cards are really expensive right now
yeah cryptocurrency mining and right
like what the hell is that yeah it was
really hard to have like a PC of the
month or like a build that I would do on
the channel and be like no one should
ever bite us don't buy this right now
this is terrible terrible ideas like and
I just had it in my garage fucking this
don't do it but now I can is it's
different so yeah let's go on to a story
that's like a lot less happy just okay
make the keep the universe balanced this
is from PC gamer but it's been talked
about everywhere his case labs beloved
beloved case manufacture for many years
is now bankrupt and liquidating they
announced this on their Twitter page
actually that it and its parent company
we're shutting down permanently after
being forced in and I quote forced into
bankruptcy and liquidation this is
another direct quote from the from their
tweet the tariffs have played a major
role raising prices by almost 80 percent
partly due to associated shortages which
cut deeply into our margins the default
of a large account added greatly to the
problem we reached out for a possible
deal that would allow us to continue on
and preserve I'm sorry persevere through
these difficult times but in the end it
didn't happen case Labs is probably
referring to the new tariff laws that
are being enforced on Chinese imports by
the US government Donald Trump the US
president hasn't seen in these tariffs
and and now China and the US are sort of
in this trade war that's causing a lot
of US companies to either lose money
lay off employees or outright shut down
completely and there's quite a bit of
controversy around here because around
this because a lot of people are saying
well maybe it wasn't the tariffs 100%
that are the cause I don't think
anywhere in case Labs statement did they
say that the tariffs were 100% the cause
but definitely had a hand in in their
eventual downfall they also said that
there was a huge default on their
account which doesn't instill the most
confidence how and how business was
being handled at the time or maybe you
know over over the past however many
months or years that the company has
been in operation so that it's it's kind
of it's hard to say we don't know the
full details on why case labs shut down
or what was the final nail in the coffin
it seems to be more or less a
combination of things just kind of that
sort of tipped the scales and eventually
was the straw that broke the camel's
back case Labs has also said that
they've been able to fulfill some case
orders but not all of them and that
other parts will most likely ship to
customers anything that's like an
accessory or something like that but
there's quite a bit of backlogged case
orders that will not be fulfilled
because they are completely shut down at
this point so it's it's definitely sad I
personally never got a chance to build
inside of the case labs case maybe I
will one day if I buy one used or
something neither but they were very
well known for for being highly like
over engineered incredibly sturdy
durable and very customizable
it's kind of like a blank slate that you
could literally do any sort of
modification to jaye Jaye's to senses
skunkworks very popular famous system
was built inside of the case labs case
and it was very loved by a lot of
enthusiasts in the community we're sad
to see it go even if we had never done a
build I don't think you ever did a build
in the case labs case either no even
though we never have that it doesn't
mean that we didn't respect what they
stood for the products that they sold so
it is sad when you see someone like that
go down in the
in the community so we wish them all the
best whatever the next endeavor is who
knows they could maybe start up a new
brand or something like that but yeah it
sucks is where this any any thoughts
comments I don't know I tweeted I when I
saw this story I tweeted and I said
thanks Trump I did see that which I
heard some which I was vaguely referring
to everyone like anytime when Obama was
was the president they would always say
thanks Omar yeah and you know obviously
there's there's different layers to that
and everything but I got a I get a bunch
of flack a bunch of people I mean I got
a bunch of responses sure from people
critiquing me once you who is supporting
me order like if anyone gets a sniff of
poetry there's certainly something to be
said for like alright we don't know the
details of case labs business right and
were they running on like such thin
margins that you know the slightest push
was able to push them out of business
sure I don't know I don't know they're
books and I don't think they should be
forced to open up the books erecting
like that right all I know is that the
the trade war the tariffs is completely
pointless and unnecessary right there
was no reason to do any of this yeah it
just seems not helping anyone so II and
if you talk to anyone who's like you
know and a common economist for a living
they're like trade wars are stupid and
they're always stupid and they're just
countries like battle they like the
government's battling each other while
all the people who have to pay for
things like I guess we have to pay more
money now sure awesome so that's my
stance I'd anyway I'm sure I'm sure yeah
yeah I'm sure that there are reasons for
you know the other side probably has
their reasons up there saying are true
and people can choose to believe those
or not at the end of the day though so
far it seems to not be very fruitful
and I was gonna say something about else
about this but oh yeah I was gonna say
that like your tweet yeah okay so maybe
there are some personal thoughts from
out of yours that were behind it but I
felt like it was basically just a meme
like that tweet that you're like thanks
Trump like it's basically like I mean
without a picture and people got so they
took it so personally
which is hilarious because you should
never take a meme personally in my
opinion even if it contradicts what you
believe like it's a meme it's not worth
arguing over I don't know maybe I'm
wrong
who knows but we can move on yeah let's
move on let's move on let's let's talk
about another hot hardware article from
from from them about the Amazon echo the
Amazon echo has been hacked you should
all burn your echoes right now just go
into your living room unplug your echo
and throw it into a tub while it's on
and then light it on fire
okay properly I don't have an Amazon
echo Cal well then you're safe and you
will live something about a day whereas
everyone else will die because
researchers whoo-hoo you and Keon Wang
Qiang sorry demonstrated at Def Con 2018
that there's a technique for hacking
these Amazon echo speakers the second
gen speakers that allows attackers to
spy on the speakers owner after a month
of experimenting the hacking duo was
only able to intercept the speaker's
microphone they were not able to tap
into the whole network that was it that
the speaker was attached to which is
good because if that if they were able
to do that they could potentially gain
access to other smart home enabled
devices like locks or security systems
for example but after all their
tinkering with this speaker they were
only able to hack the speaker's
microphone ba
that's still pretty serious because that
essentially allows them to eavesdrop on
conversations that happen around the
speaker or basically anything that the
speaker can hear they can hear too which
is really kind of creepy it's not it's
not a simple hack though and this is why
you shouldn't be too concerned is that
it this hack requires physical access to
the device right then and there
99.99999% people are safe because
hackers usually don't break into your
house and you know physically in an
interface with your devices but it
required them to have physical access to
the speaker because they essentially had
to remove it's it's a it's an embedded
flash chip and modify it so that it
would have its own firmware the hackers
own firmware on there like whenever
there's a hack and the exploit requires
physical access again I'm always a
little bit more dismissive but
absolutely absolutely but how much
longer until we find this can somehow be
done remotely right exactly yeah finding
a way to access the the firmware and
updating it remotely is also a concern
so at the very least it's still good to
know what could be done with your
devices should they have physical access
to the outside world and so once they
hack that firmware they can essentially
take that modified echo and have it
infect or hack other echo speakers in
the same Wi-Fi network because a lot of
people a lot of users will have multiple
smart speakers or whenever in their home
right especially people with like larger
homes maybe you have one or two
throughout the house and stuff so you
you infect one if they if they can have
physical access to one that can infect
the others remotely at that point things
like the various web exploits in the
Alexa interface including cross-site
scripting URL redirection and HTTP
downgrade attacks the research was given
to Amazon who quickly rolled out fixes
to patch the security vulnerabilities
that made this type of attack possible
so I guess that's at the end of the day
you
do not have to throw away the Amazon
echo that's currently sitting in your
living room that nobody you said at the
beginning and didn't because now they've
thrown away their echo wheaton they
should that's that's just us you know
rewarding people who watch our entire
trail get a watch since and punishing
everyone who doesn't final an article
here we'll go through this really
quickly google is tracking you even if
you turn your location history off this
is an article from hexxus net but it was
also plastered everywhere else on the
web The Associated Press held an
investigation that discovered that
Google wants to know where you go so
badly that it records your movements
even when you explicitly tell it not to
these findings were confirmed by
computer scientists at Princeton
University before AP went on to publish
its story Comp Sci students are cops AI
scientists at Princeton University they
are much smarter than any anyone here so
I trust what they say a lot don't worry
this only affects up to two billion
Android and iOS users good disabling
location history doesn't keep Google
from tracking your location some google
apps automatically store timestamp data
timestamp location data without asking
you can delete the data yourself yes but
that requires a laborious process to go
through most people are not willing to
do google apps that might track you even
when you tell them not to include maps
which apparently stores a snapshot of
apps wants to know your location even
when you tell it not to know your
location though even if you're just
opening up maps to look at a map without
needing to know where you are on the GPS
with the GPS maps apparently stores a
snapshot of your location when you
launch the app whether or not you have
location history on it'll just take a
snapshot of where ever you are and know
where you are at that time when you open
up maps which makes so I'll get to that
later whether the weather app from
Google pinpoints your location to give
you accurate weather reports I guess
that's a fair trade knowing where I am
at all times and telling me what the
weather is like if it's raining outside
sure why not
and search even if you're searching
even if your search has nothing to do
with with location search apparently is
tracking your every move as well
you can best limit Google's location
tracking by disabling not just the
location history but also your web and
app activity there's an option for that
as well you go to the settings disable
both of those and it will the article
doesn't say it will eliminate any
tracking but it will significantly
reduce the amount of tracking that
Google does on your vulnerable body you
can also check through the data that's
currently stored on your phone or device
via your Google account webpage at my
activity google.com why why does Google
wanna track you so bad well money is a
short answer big data big data baby
Google can can sell basically your
location whereabouts to advertisers so
that they can better advertise to you
additionally they recently unveiled a
tool called local campaigns that
dynamically uses ads to boost in person
store visits advertising is really the
the biggest thing here Google's let
advertisers track the effectiveness of
online ads at a driving foot traffic
which is a feature that relies heavily
on user location history I mean it makes
sense it makes sense that Google rakes
in about a hundred billion dollars in in
location history reliant and revenue per
year a hundred billion dollars from
knowing where you are so yeah
everyone go destroy your phones now burn
him in the fire
you can like it you can take your Amazon
that Cup make sense to me or your phone
that they can do that but there's a
layer of abstraction between them
knowing your data like where you are and
profit yeah but there's an in-between
there's like advertising effectively
that's the middle that's the middle
partner yeah advertising is the sort of
middle middle man and all of this see
I've never been concerned with this
because I've never turned my location
history up I'm I've always wanted Google
to know exactly where I am just for
convenience for note for all the apps
and stuff so that you so that you have a
more convenient experience on Android
yeah I want and one effective
advertising of products that is tailored
for my tastes and specific location at
any given moment in time yeah yeah you
know and it's like hey we noticed that
you're in Siberia here's the baby where
does it check it maybe you want to shoot
with a bunch of dogs see that's
convenient there everyone should just be
okay with it
and it's crazy because that's a valid
argument some people just like that the
convenience of their phone knowing where
they are and and like unlike my phone
just speaks to me it's like it knows me
personally well so does your mom and
your mom knows you personally because
she kind of knows like where you go
everyday and stuff she knows your
whereabouts so if you like the fact that
like your Google phone or whatever phone
you have is kind of like a family member
and they're that intimately in tune with
your whereabouts then you shouldn't be
surprised when you get targeted ads that
are suspiciously familiar to what your
likes and interests are based on where
you've been in the last five years or
whatever the fuck so you can't have your
cake and eat it too there's always a
compromise between security and convene
and privacy and all that shit so at the
other day you've been informed we're all
probably security for Oscars let's move
on to that's pretty much it for my
halfway jump in the donations here
though thank you guys so much for
donating you never have but it's always
appreciated
Maddy ice twenty to thirty dollars thank
you very much for the generous donation
love you love you love your show guys I
have a request though when does the new
Asus Thor power supply come out hope you
guys have a great week that was an
awesome the one that's like I'd applaud
just like a hammer hit like a Thor
hammer I was no fun I don't know if that
actually I think I asked those like this
is come with the retail version they
said no and I was like that's stupid no
they just set that up for the show as
kind of a guilt it's like I know but the
gimmick is what sells it so just sell -
get it - what would you do with the
handle if you're building a computer
gimmicks don't require a logical
explanation Paul that's why they're
gimmicks but they sure can sell if it's
the right kind of gimmick I don't know
when that power supply is coming out I
probably ask them when they probably
totally but I don't remember there's
more interesting things coming out of
the power supply's though especially
when they're not gimmicky nd sixty-seven
thirteen dollars and 37 cents Kyle first
off cope I you and Paul have safe
travels yeah I hope you do do like you
said speaking of I'm going to be in Napa
around the time of twitchcon of course
you are
because that's that's where you're from
I saw that tweet I don't think I don't
read tweets cool twits Connor are you
and Paul gonna be there regardless
cheers twitchcon this year
wait so Napa is is this twitchcon in
Napa this year no look up look up where
twitchcon is happening I would love to
go to twitchcon again twitchcon is one
of those things where you can just kind
of like show up and chill because it's
not really tech related very heavily so
I don't have to like you know go to a
bunch of booths and shoot about 300
chasse is a hundred and seventy nine
dollars where October 25th so 28 what CB
does Inc X $5 Cal you should have had
issues you should have your cats in your
videos I do I even did it in San Jose
San Jose okay yeah so that's near net
little closer to Napa
San Jose would be a cool
Kayson okay San Jose maybe maybe I'll go
who knows if I can get maybe someone to
pay my way there it sponsor mean shit
literally don't have to do anything I'm
gonna pay for it and organize the whole
thing kind of what it comes down to just
just go yeah that's totally dad we
teleported you'd be teleported somebody
just fondles my balls the whole way
there excellence that's sometimes that's
my requirement we're dudes are an end
Thank You Chet we lift you up okay yeah
it's because we hardly and I think this
goes for both of us we hardly ever get
time to relax these days it's like if we
are gonna relax we don't want to spend
time working to make the relaxation
happen at like planning for a vacation
or like a relaxation weekend at some
place like twitchcon is work and it
takes time and it drains your energy so
if like if that process can be made
easier I'm more likely to take it so
again we'll see it's reasonable sponsors
are open um let's move on Berzin get X
oh yeah I should have my catch my videos
yeah my cat's my videos of course I do
more cats ow my freaking litter box
video has more views than most of my
videos that's ridiculous
well how many views this year later over
a million anything this stupid litter
box video I'm like are you freakin kid
and I like I didn't spend any time on
the thumbnail it's just literally a
picture of the cat going into a little
boy I really I really hope that becomes
your most popular video I mean that
would pretty much sum up YouTube on that
I have to go the lightest after the
latest and see if his most popular one
is still
stupid is it in the fire truck fire
surprised crayfish my hello really ten
million that million views I'm kind of
shocked he doesn't have any videos long
very short video my god what even gaming
at six cameras to be his top two or
three videos where it's not worried like
a toy or toys to be fair that was out
six years ago yeah and his gaming at six
K was one year sixteen seven point five
million so so it's not like he hasn't
had any hits since that door but I'm
still so ridiculous okay all right maja
that's why it's like how hasn't Channel
super fun not taken off I know and
surpassed - tech tips and who knows crit
fish five dollars hello from KCMO guys
II don't know what's KCMO I don't know
those in honor of the August primary Ken
Lyle talk about any experience in
Missouri ah any experience he has with
American elections no he cannot before I
taped it him by the way Lyle I don't
think why all those I don't know what he
would vote huh it's probably a good
thing that lockup listen folk to be
honest it's for the good of all people
thank you very much though critic
Michael real pal 5canadian I upgrade my
6600 K overclock 4.5 gigahertz to an
8700 K or wait for the 9700 plus I wait
yeah we might as well weights right
around the corner October 1st apparently
bazinga X once again five dollars
towards beer proofing your PC Kyle
it's very yes very useful enough $5
donations and I won't have to worry
about how much beer I spill my PC just
build a new one bazinga X again G's $5
for calling me a mother ever last week
lol you know what you are a mother
fucker bazinga X because if that's gonna
get me more money than hell I'll call
you all the things that you want me to
space Butler mm $10 I'm new to
overclocking and I overclocked my 1800 X
2 4 gigahertz in the UEFI but the rise
of master and task manager say it's
running a 2.2 gigahertz in the base
clock is 4 4 4 4 gigahertz
does this mean it was a failed overclock
space Butler your CPU naturally well not
depending on how you overclock my CP
will not always run at the
see that you set it to it'll travel
itself down in order to save power when
it's not
excuse me being tasked with with lots of
things to do it's usually an offset or
something like that so yeah the software
i've been using most frequently is
hardware info or h hardware info 64 yeah
HW info if you run that it'll keep track
of the current frequency the minimum
frequency the maximum frequency and the
average frequency yeah so there you can
look and see the max frequency can be a
co this core is boosting up to this
frequency this court would lose t up to
this frequency it's green software just
two sensors only mode and you can look
at all that information it's also a
pretty accurate software for risin I
found yeah yeah it always matches like
rising master one-to-one pretty much I
think they were on top of the updates
when that was all launching and
everything yet with the offsets with the
temperature and stuff yeah and speaking
of offsets if you have overclock your
cpu with an offset voltage then the the
whole point of that is to is some that
you're not running at the you know the
max voltage is the whole time and you're
only ramping that up and you're ramping
your clock speeds up when you're under a
significant load it's a good power
saving measure that I suggest a lot of
people do if they're gonna be
overclocking 24/7 as opposed to just
dialing in a fixed overclock voltage and
multiplier poor ratio I mean and going
to town so yeah good like San Diego LAN
my fellers letteth on this weekend oh
yeah Brian actually asked me to plug the
vilena thana I replied to him San Diego
LAN net is having a brand-spanking-new
land
I believe it's it's this week weekend
18th to the 20th Saturday Sunday Monday
yes I'm Melana thon if you're in the San
Diego area you should definitely check
it out yeah tickets are already half
gone they're already half sold out and
you should you should go and just
playing video games with a bunch of
other nerds it's not intimidating
everyone else is nerdy and stuff just go
and have a good time so there's no
gatekeepers there being like
you're not good enough at landing to be
here you know so San Diego land on that
Thank You thanks Brian and thanks for
sandy the land also just for those of
you who note is the the same
organization that invited Paul and I out
to comic-con yeah couple weeks ago and
had a really cool land party there and
it was it was a huge hit they know how
to land their lands are always killer so
go check them out
bazinga X $5 Google changing their name
to Skynet we will all die that's
probably very true but at least I will
get to say that I had a Skynet phone at
least we'd have a little bit of advance
noticed I feel like as well because if
Google changed the name of the Skynet
I'd be like right well is this precedes
the epochal cancer and we never see it
coming
George yeah Tom Lucero you know as Paul
can you do a Powerball follow up video
Powerball my power waffle means
Powerball did it end up powering your AC
or not Tom I am planning a follow-up
video but I'm gonna wait a couple months
I just I want to gather more data like I
want to be able to say here's how it
performed this period of time with
different temperatures I've been doing
random screen caps of like yeah of the
power usage and everything like that so
yes I am planning a follow-up video but
it probably won't be out till maybe like
next month so sorry for the week but me
needs more data needs back that's all
Johnson's let's do them on my half okay
sure okay I have a lot of Johnson's so
anyone who bought stuff from either of
our stores we old Johnson the shit out
of you on pulse half which is a great
way for us to make you watch the rest of
the show exactly thank you very much for
watching
don't go anywhere go to Paul's channel
right now if you're watching on YouTube
go to Paul's channel I'll put a link and
put a link in my description if you're
on Twitter stay where you are thank you
guys so much feel free to do timestamps
on the on the youtube video as well I
will love you for life and you're all
beautiful I'll see you in a second
thanks I spirit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
