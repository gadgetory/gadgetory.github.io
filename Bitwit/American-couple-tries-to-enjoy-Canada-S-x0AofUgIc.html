right we made it through immigration and
I was like the easiest interview ever
because you know they're Canadian super
nice who's actually asked me what do you
do does a guy have YouTube channels I go
what's it called maybe I'll check it out
you're in it now say hi they subscribe
to do it yeah I love Canada in case
you're wondering why we're in Vancouver
in the first place we're actually here
for the roast of Medina Sebastian Linus
himself of limas tech tips I was
actually invited to be one of the
Roasters it was a huge honor by the way
along with some other notable people
including LMG staff Jay from JSU cents
as well as Steve from gamers in Texas
will also be on the panel so very
excited to be here thanks LMG crew first
rule of order in foreign countries is to
by simply this is actually the reason
why I bought a pixel too specifically
from Amazon in the first place fully
unlocked just for this reason SIM card
simulator
oh it didn't work no doesn't work for me
yeah okay so no one's gonna believe this
because I didn't get it on camera I
actually had a homeless guy let me
borrow his ticket to get out when does
that happen
it's freakin Canada I've never gotten
any handouts from any homeless people I
need you know start working on the
hotels kind of weird yeah I don't know
what these pictures are this one says
welcome to fire festival this is my
masterpiece
I call it through the eyes of a predator
this one just says oh my god I trusted
my leg this collection wouldn't be
complete without blue balls
okay first meal in Canada yeah we had a
couple advertisers that were tasty we
have a portobello mushroom burger Cheers
cheers mate as they don't say in Canada
all right our bellies are full albeit
with vegan food we have it was it was
pretty good it was surprisingly yeah
back in the hotel room potty time let's
turn up that's not how you turn up
there's not what we're trying to do
right now get your fat Fanny up how dare
you talk about Paul that way when he's
not here he's pregnant you know I don't
these windows open does it make you
nervous if I lean against the window
no hands all my weight on the window if
it broke right now I would die I would
just fall out the window oh it's kind of
freaking me out okay now that we're back
in the hotel room is it just me or is
everyone here white or Asian true
wifey sauce agrees I'm half white and
half asian wait hold on everyone on the
LTTE channel on that team is either
white or Asian
you've got lioness Luke Colton all the
whities and there's Dennis Ed's oh oh my
gosh I should be with them yeah it's all
still works for lioness believe it or
not I don't know why I'm pretty sure
Linus promoted him to like senior VP of
the Asians hey what are we doing
so it looks like we're gonna go
downstairs have a couple drinks in the
hotel lobby while we play where is it
Chris monopoly deal it's super fun so
let's play you wanna play downstairs
yeah all right let's go
guess who won free property sets in a
row clean fair and square you know what
if you don't like it you're just gonna
have to do you rematch so I won I won
the second round too oh yeah I won all
three you're on a losing streak I beat
you fair and square
okay just won five I just won five
rounds in a row
wifey sauces promo for monopoly deal
these guys owe us money yeah let's make
a deal so good all right all right he
used to get the game but you're great at
putts so wifey sauce got hungry again so
we went to Subway you how anyway and now
we I got hit up by a by an old-time
friend of mine he's kind of a dick hole
but we're gonna go have a drink over to
know I can't really I was banking on
your projecting voice to carry me
through the night you're welcome
hi mrs. J ste cents
we're gonna talk now this is this is
what it's like guys if you ever wanted
to know what it's like be male there
with Jay I have to fart 17 yeah
no baby so he's oq I'm gonna pound it
all one and a half ounces actually how
many Ounces are in here what's 135
milliliters that's four and a half
ounces so it's about three shots three
shots of beer in one little tiny cams
let's try it out it tastes like Asahi
but smaller so in the States we have
Starbucks like on every block they have
Starbucks here too but they also have
Tim Hortons which we do not so how would
you rate Tim Hortons coffee compared to
Starbucks say what you mean 3 out of 10
3 out of 10 it tastes like convenience
store coffee
everything here really sucks it's not
just - what do you think you be C stands
for you baby chicken look burnt coffee
can you put this in your purse thank you
you know as a married man of 3 years
what I've learned is that your wife's
purse is really just the husband's
extended pocket it really is it's a
great thing okay I actually picked this
restaurant out for lunch dim sum is
traditional Chinese food that's usually
never vegetarian friendly and we managed
to find a vegetarian / vegan one right
here in the middle of an Coover it's
called Pocock
oh it's busy busy in here that's good
this is bean curd with black bean sauce
if you're not familiar with bean curd
it's basically tofu skin so it kind of
looks like chicken feet but it's white
is intimidating we call this one phlegm
noodle because it has the consistency
and texture of phlegm thanks it's good
but it's really good it's really good
flavor
we're all done with lunch and we're
ready to go to gas town which is
supposed to be a cool little
neighborhood but we're also kind of on
the outskirts of downtown so there are
like no cabs around so we're just kind
of walking in the general direction we
need to go but if we were to just walk
the rest of the way would be
approximately a 50 minute walk I guess
we're just gonna keep walking until we
find a cab because we really have no
other choice wait is that a taxi flag a
ban flag her down no no come back you
are all they hope the hunt continues for
did he have his light on so he probably
just didn't like you like Oh ugly
American girl
I think that was Lyle's while I was
driving that cab we got one whoo thank
God we're going to a gas can
now we're set a nice little local coffee
shop drinking a nice cup of joe white
the sauce why do you look so well you
look so mad you look kind of salty there
it's because I just won my seventh
consecutive round of monopoly deal huh I
think I think so I think that's exactly
what happened this place closes in 8
hours don't think we have that long now
we're in a baby store how do we get in a
baby store
honey these are cute but they're not
gonna fit me right these are these
breasts and knuckles for babies oh no
they're wood knuckles for babies oh my
god that clocks on fire the thing is
steaming someone overclocked it am I the
only one that finds it hilarious that
the clock is smoking at 4:20 by the way
weed is legal in Canada and it smells a
lot like weed right now I smell weed
everywhere I'm I'm pretty sure it's that
clock we decided to do something a
little bit different for our last nine
Vancouver so we're seeing a play
aren't we art see the play we're seeing
is called bed-and-breakfast it's one of
those heartfelt comedies it's about two
guys who are a couple and they try to
make the home out of relatively
uninviting environment it's only two
guys in the entire play but they play
about 20 different characters two actors
twenty characters should be kind of fun
coming
we're an intermission now so far I'm
really liking apply I think both of us
are wifey you liking it it's
surprisingly relatable because the the
couple moves into a new town into a new
house that's a total fixer-upper
just like wiper sauce that's done we can
relate so it's extremely relatable I
think we might begin
so the play was amazing we both loved it
now we want to go see every play in
existence but this being her last name
Vancouver we felt it was being
incomplete without topping it off with a
nice helping of poutine poutine is
basically french fries with cheese curds
gravy and much brother unhealthy stuff
probably gonna kill us it's all worth it
okay we're going back home this morning
we'll be back here in Vancouver come
July towards the end of July for LTX yes
a lot of people have been asking us
constantly we will be at the Linus tech
tips Expo we're very excited to go it'll
be our first year there with whyphy
sauce and I'll be there can't wait to
meet some of you guys there
no guys thanks for watching this
vlog my college before you go if you
enjoyed it to end get subscribe for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon I
am currently Irish and you will see me
