talked about gaming we look at your PC's

cream we have a vanilla cream ale and
then we're gonna be switching over here
to this Dragon's milk du dragon
yeah Dragon's milk which I got because
I'm excited about Game of Thrones coming
but I'm gonna say this is a Denarius
Targaryen drink well it's also a bourbon
barrel-aged stout rich roasty and creamy
with heavy notes of vanilla and just
enough familiar warmth from oak barrels
I can't imagine the mother of dragons
drinking anything

eventually but on that note let's talk
about some video games game because it's
been a good month for gaming for the
most part we had III just a week or two
ago and there are a lot of big
announcements there now we watched that
from a distance in the comfort of my own
home
indeed so as did I sir as did I and now
we have this lame summer sale going on
Cheers
hello email I'm gonna drink my bedsheets
thanks for being here dear
we love you drink with us if you're of
legal drinking age of course so umm
steam summer sale is going down right
now
and I think this up from the PC gaming
subreddit I don't follow him normally
but he made the front page on that
subreddit this is totalbiscuit to many
of you guys know of him the cynical brit
who does a lot of gaming videos on
youtube he's got 2.2 million subscribers
he did a top 20 picks of the summer
Steam sale for under 5 bucks
so these are all under $5 very
affordable almost anyone can afford this
and he had a list of 20 games or so I'm
not gonna go through all of them but
some of which that stood out include
Dishonored Fallout New Vegas serious Sam
Double Dee XXL which I really like just
because of the name and insurgency which
is actually a game that I have played
personally I'm not too much but enough
to get the gist of it and that's a
really fun game for I think a buck 50
that game was on sale I think I probably
bought some 1015 yeah so that's it
that's a killer deal on if you want sort
of a quasi milsim with really good gun
mechanics and stuff but you guys can go
ahead watch the whole video it's almost
half an hour long he kind of gives a
really good explanation of each game
that he picks so you know just to give
you sort of a the general idea but I I
kind of just pull this up to discuss the
summer Steam sale what you guys think of
it and really where where you're at when
it comes to buying games during the
summer sale
I've bought nothing so far you've bought
nothing yeah babies it's not that's it's
because I haven't really looked that
closely at it I was waiting for you to
bring all this information yeah of
course you're thorough research and
everything would be ill-advised buying
before the service oh yeah so you know
what what to buy this is true um I
actually to be honest I haven't bought
anything either I've been so busy I
haven't even looked at what's what's
what's all good so I assume I assume you
looked at some stuff prior to this
report right um no I pretty much just
looked at this report oh I haven't even
like logged into steam in like weeks
sorry we're like the most terrible
people to be listening to when it comes
to like actually getting it's like
hearing about video games and stuff yeah
I'm just getting this all through you
know through the friggin Internet
I mean I'm updating steam right now just
so I can log on and take a gander it at
some of the sales but you know I'm
actually writing this show have
reference stories here when they're to
the show as we go along
yeah I've got some done some preparation
yeah no I mean Jake just just a little
bit I don't want to admit that I've done
that much crap but um steam summer sale
is going on until July 5th so you guys
have not not much longer to buy a week a
little over well a little over a week I
mean it started June 22nd so we're about
in the middle of it right now maybe it's
still in the early early side of things
but we are gonna be asking you guys
later on in this episode are we supposed
to ask that and this question we're
gonna do that later later that later
yeah
oh that was there assuming that that's
for the other special segments
correctamundo so initially this segment
was gonna be a little bit longer but we
I shifted some things around I see
anyway steam so summer sales going on go
ahead and watch that video if you're
interested in picking up a few games for
under 5 bucks let's move on to the next
what do you hear about it why are you
watching this video yeah go watch that
video exactly
um that's usually how these things go
this week enemies in killing floor very
famous popular world-renowned
zombie shooter first person co-op game
but has gotten uh it's got a new game
mode opposite the zombies the zombies
shrink when you shoot them Paul that's
terrifying revolutionary Nick is that
what's gonna
in here so basically this is one of
eight weekly outbreaks outbreak
challenges that will run until August
that developer tripwire and sort of used
as a fun way to spice up their their
game I've played a little bit of killing
floor I enjoyed it
actually played it at LAN syndicate two
years ago or a year or two ago
yeah played with Joker actually you know
that was a game like I was I was I was
working on other stuff and then like I
was trying to get the killing floor
I've been running on my computer and I
never did yeah yeah I don't know what
was going on with it but some internet
struck cause the point where is like you
know what I'm just gonna have a beer and
not play Killing Floor 2 well you know
what Paul now's your chance if you ever
want to try it out you got to try the
new Tiny Terror weekly outbreak
challenge I don't know it's not really
grabbing me really tiny zombies really
you've never had a desire to shoot
little tiny mini zombies only on
minecraft imagine like me I wish I wish
I could shoot the mini zombies in
Minecraft ugh I will say that but
imagine how much better or skilled you
would be they're terrifying in and and
in first-person shooters if you had to
get headshots on little tiny mini mini
NPCs so it makes it more challenging
because they're small it is a challenge
yes does it smaller hitbox okay smaller
targets that makes sense and there and
hopefully they you know what I really
hope they do is I hope they like
increase the picture of all the zombie
voices when they get small I have to go
this should you know I hope they took
the sound engineering into consideration
with with this this challenge brain
that's pretty good Megan I I work for I
work for killing floor or for the for
tripwire then there's like a bunch of
other ones that are coming out later in
like the next few weeks other challenges
include exploding Zed's oh alright so
that's kind of fun I'm also very
hazardous don't don't shoot him
point-blank right and then you've also
got bobbles heads bubbles heads
yeah ba-bling head bobbing heads on
those ends that's and I feel like that's
like the
opposite of the tiny terror here clever
where it's easier to get headshots
hopefully if they're they're all
big-headed like none of them are us the
large heads are like had to have more
armor or something no no that could be
true no yeah or maybe they're just
really like egotistic because they have
big heads I mean that maybe they just
keep agreeing with you because they're
big heads
is it bubble heads because oh oh yeah
right I don't know I don't know Bubba I
guess it depends on how you how you
smell how you flick it and then there's
also some balloons heads so when you
shoot them they inflate and then they
start potentially flying away ah and you
can pop them afterwards that sounds kind
of fun that sounds interesting I feel
like that's that'd be like easy mode
which since I'm pretty bad at that game
I I would do that one but nonetheless
maybe you can see if killing floor is on
sale this number Steam sale or whatever
maybe I could do maybe I can see that no
just people in general just oh the
people out there but you too if you ever
interested I mean I didn't know if
you're trying to kill me like I should
look that up right now
no no no obligations okay all right it's
our own sorry that's okay so usually we
have a pretty good you know like if the
suggestion comes out kind of pick up on
it and stuff it I don't know
for whatever reason you know I'm picking
up what I'm putting down to everything
anyway I guess that um watch watch this
next article PC camera look from PC
gamer yeah they're doing stuff dangerous
people are doing things
Cmdr how's the thyroid ISO kicks I don't
know it seemed to our commander maybe
this is about Billy dangerous yeah I
totally prepared for the show I saw you
prepared I saw you do a lot of
preparation know what it is this gives
I'm like completely sober we're just
really what I can't I can't function
unless I'm completely trash well that's
just that's just how I operate the doors
it's weird man the worst games normally
we're pretty bad at games report yeah I
feel like this is a special thing going
here's a video so elite dangerous that
if they've kicked off this the saga
their thyroid thyroid saga dashboard
bobble head or anything which is about
aliens and most of the people who are
familiar with this have already
discovered an alien crash site and
totally alien spacecraft now players of
the game have found a thyroid machine
and have worked out how to activate it
so elite dangerous as many of us know is
a space exploration simulator Vidya
refuses to live and you basically to my
knowledge ease roll around in a
spacecraft you you mind things you you
find new planets you land on a Mike Hawk
19 second 1969 what a guy so people
found this like alien type machine or
whatever they found like a sort of alien
base and they figured out how to
activate it I would show you guys the
video but it's like three and a half
hours long the one I yeah that's what I
was trying to cue up right there there
but when I tried to jump ahead at all it
wasn't loading yeah yeah so I mean I
kind of scrub through it as much as I
could in the three-and-a-half hour video
scrub through and like I've never played
elite dangerous so I had no idea what
was going on like the whole three hours
I I couldn't tell you but I'm sure some
of you out there are interested in the
game I feel like really dangerous is one
of those titles that if I had way more
free time I would probably like buy one
of those HOTAS systems and he'll be
scrapped like an H MD to my face and
just zone out like it's super lit maybe
like drink about your beer and then just
play elite dangerous for like 10 hours
straight or you can take advantage if
you're your new marijuana license or I
can take advantage of the new med car
that I got yes that's that's a great
idea Paul just get blazed out of your
gourd cuz hell was that
I probably one of the dogs that was okay
everything's fine
anyway needles to say le dangerous is
there they're doing things there's new
things to discover all the time in that
game
and go play it there's no way I'm gonna
have Steve still plays elite dangerous
he was someone I knew who played that
the most yeah yeah I didn't really know
anyone else he was the only one all
right and now he's gone he's gone
forever
no I mean he just moved it's like the
other side of LA yeah it's basically the
same like it's being gone forever cuz
there's no way that's a crazy direct
grip Steve rip Steve yes all right let's
move on to the next story which is about
a new VR game Gorn Gorn this is from the
folks who brought you bro for school
sleep island they are brawler so if you
guys played broforce you know it's
pretty violent for being a
side-scrolling 2d game but now you have
some three-dimensional VR going
down from the folks who brought you that
bloody side scroller this is studio free
live I know they have like
free labs they also developed genital
jousting which sounds like a fun game
let their underwear on and I quote
they're working on a ludicrously violent
VR gladiator simulator which looks super
fun yeah I feel like gore and this kind
of cartoony style is always appreciated
he's comic did you see me just flip them
off the the VR chair I just flip them
off do you notice that it's very
irreverent yeah that's what you would do
right if you were in like the Coliseum
effort right before you bash your
enemies in the face with whatever hit
Warhammer you're wielding you flip them
off well yeah and you can do that now
virtual red the best part about this
game is you can actually dismember your
your enemies you can like sort of
disfigure them and rip off their limbs
as you see fit I say that's exciting
you're like hey I think this is a
turning point for this video mm-hmm
actually for for for this segment I
would say and hopefully the live show as
a whole probably both of our channels I
feel like this is where things take a
turn for the better
of course early access July 10th though
yeah oh it's coming up pretty soon yeah
so I'm I'm hopefully multi play so I'm
working on rebuilding my my home theater
PC out there in the living room
I'm really looking forward to getting
the VR setup back back up and running I
had it set up out there with a separate
computer because my existing htpc was a
powerful enough right but I I can't I
kind of miss it
being able to just get a straight I'm
gonna just like jack in and you know do
some VR ready player one is yeah I agree
yeah that's that's gonna be exciting but
and and there's a lot of games that have
come out in like the past few months
that or that I haven't had a chance to
transom yeah I'm sure playing VR like
now like if we were to actually spend a
few hours in VR I'm sure we like the
games have advanced so much since we
initially thought arises from Doss to
like Windows Windows 7 Windows 10 at
least Windows 10 anything not Windows we
may step back a little bit all right but
that's that's pretty much it for games
report those are all the important
stories in gaming news for this week all
right no stone unturned else needs to
read any other gaming news stories no
your nope just one book mark IGN you're
all saved for this week 0 out of 10
all right all right let's our next
segment is sort of it's a new segment
it's a new set wall this old segment
that has a new name I supposed to tell
them that it's a rehash of some like
sorry Paul is if I'm just more honest
with my viewers than you that's I just
think if you want to get a you coming
out and being like hey we're about to
serve you leftovers isn't exactly the
way to see I don't reserve I don't
resort to deceit and trickery that's
fine just to get just to get it make the
viewers cop a boner
I mean you know are you it's they get
hard wet or without measure as best
we're looking at prevarication here
which i technically are using big words
buying shirt but I feel done it's
prevarication that's why though I'm not
even gonna try to repeat that word I'll
probably just take slurp see I can't
even say the word sliver that's learn it
alright sorry for the rest of this
livestream I'll do my best to issue
I used to know what that means okay
anyway
ask chat ask chat is the name of today's
segment the sounds complicated how's it
work
alright well let me tell you Paul you
know just needs a full-blown explanation
actually you and I are gonna ask chat a
series of questions you chat will answer
those questions a target sick and then
Paul and I will go against each other
and and guess what you guys answered and
whoever guesses the right answer gets
bragging rights and whoever whoever
loses has to take a drink of their beer
they have to drink drink take a very
large gulp a single wage gold oh there's
punishment of excess see does require
explaining maybe maybe there's more to
ask chat than meets the eye
Paul see which makes were calling it is
a new sick values I'm spilling things
see I would be paying attention to you
but I'm too busy you know helping
support your segment by pasting the
straw poll link for the first question
why thank you very much by the way that
we think you say alright did you get
YouTube to your should I do that it's a
wait we we have to guess who yeah I got
both okay cool thanks good good good
alright so here's the question this is
actually relating to the killing floor
article that we just talked about where
you know they had a tiny mode I throw
this so this is sort of a nostalgic
question what's your favorite special
game-mode for an FPS game so the
examples that I have here I kind of
thought back to like the original
Goldeneye on n64 how they add all those
special game yeah low gravity paintball
big heads and visibility
we've got explosives only pistols only
dildo melee only that was Paul's
contribution to the straw poll so you
guys go ahead and pick your favorite and
if your absolute favorite one isn't on
here then pick whichever one you like
the best
Paul and I are gonna try to guess the
audience we're gonna try to guess what
you guys might have three birdies and
it's probably
go through each question and then start
guessing each question are we gonna do
each one one at a time we're gonna we're
gonna do we're gonna go through all
three and then we're gonna answer them
and then we're gonna reveal the answer
oh oh once so the next the next question
here you paste in chat this time I'll
paste in chat this time this is sort of
inspired from the totalbiscuit article
about the steam summer sale somebody
throwbacks pretty I know I'm it's a
nostalgia yeah you did plan and you plan
retro mofos you play into the show
somehow I did I don't know how that boy
uses cookies
so um this is about the steam summer
sale how many games have you bought so
far the answers include none there are
no good games on sale I'd rather play in
the middle I'm gonna vote for none
because we both already said that we
vote we've gotten none sure with my butt
crack go back go back what I don't want
to look at it we can't I can't go back I
can't actually look at this can't just
go but oh yeah you can we can't look at
they can't go back at the back button
don't vote anymore you said I already
voted I can't vote again anymore let me
worry alright stop it
alright so guys what you may have seen
was just really initial early votes it's
not at all something nor should this way
your opinion tour everyone please vote
from your heart and what what is true so
none there are no good games until I'd
rather play a fiddle with my butt crack
I've seen it done before
that doesn't seem possible it's it's
possible I don't believe you I'll prove
it to you I had a 1 to 2 I'm a
reasonable man or woman guys you got it
shout out to those ladies y'all yeah 3 5
35 games deals
hello deals and 6 to 10 and you'll play
and beat every single one of them like
we always do
given we buy large array of games what's
that Corsair shared a funny and funny
comic earlier and it was like this dude
like second there's no steam named ash I
would buy it we'll do it and then like
there's a closet behind them it's like
all bugging all the old games and I'm
like the game takes out of them cause it
was like you already own me it was all
right I spoiled it but uh yeah what
follow Coursera is where you can watch
it in da and then the last question here
is what percentage of users have a side
panel window on their primary desktop
hmm I thought this was kind of an
interesting interesting question so I'm
gonna go ahead and paste that in chat
that could be an interesting blessing
you a-holes and yeah cuz I mean I don't
know sorry I really don't know um all
right so first first question Paul
what's your favorite special game mode
and we have we have some of the options
below G the paintball the big heads the
invisibility the explosives only the
crystals only in the dildo melee oh
let's go first on this one all right uh
no okay let's let's just you can't do
dildo milliohm dildo melees i know
what's hacking dildo mail is gonna win
let's just point that out right neither
of us can choose that we're going for
second place here okay favorite I like
low gravity actually I think you know
it's one of those elements that adds
completely changes the strategy of
certain maps especially if you're
playing if you're playing a first-person
shooter
adds different areas that you might not
have had accessibility to before you
know if you're if you're playing a game
where you can jump in that kind of thing
you can jump much higher you can access
previously inaccessible places it's
enough of a change to the game that it
makes it interesting and again on the
same map you've been playing a lot
before without completely you know
making it bit like it's a completely
different thing that you're playing yeah
okay that's actually what my first
choice was believe it or not well but
since you say route they stole it from
under my nose I'm gonna go with
explosives only because let's face it
you suck at video games how the heck are
you actually even gonna kill anyone ever
unless it's explosives only pick up a
grenade launcher or rocket launcher or
some proximity mines it doesn't matter
they're all gonna blow up somehow and by
gosh darn it
you can kill people very easily in this
mode you don't have to have much skill
you've got a kind of aim in the general
direction point and shoot and you know
area of effect will most likely take out
the person unless you're completely
blind or you know just I don't know just
do you just you suck way more than
average sucking people so um
explosives only it's fun you get to see
your your dismembered enemies just sort
of fly off in the air feels good we all
love fire
alright it's explosives all right I used
to play quake 2 and there we had a mod
that we use plasma grenades yep
it's a very similar to that that kind of
thing anyway uh here next results oh
yeah are we gonna see yeah let's do the
result wait what happens to the loser
build me a new pistol holy pistols I'll
get all those pistols you little
peashooter in there yeah Marty no more
insta kills you got that you got it you
got a you know bob and weave as you as
you pick the enemy off you know and get
as many shots as Bob yeah no yeah
pistols are still a little still honors
the headshot although it's not always an
insta-kill depending on the game you're
playing of course true alright so dildo
manically I win with no gravity yay hey
you did have here we're close to there
yeah this is old me so this is I could
be there we go the last got the least
amount paintball mom paintballs last
with only three percent of the vote
understood alright what was here what
did you have to do alright they could
drink of this oh I have to take a big
sip big drink of beer
alright what a horrible put it by the
way did you know this is eleven percent
alcohol
yeah it's stoked it's strong yeah I've
had like six percent steps before it
doesn't necessarily mean it's high okay
that over Golconda but see that's are
more likely to be higher in alcohol
content by volumen
all that good stuff alright next step
sweet summer sale we are say already
known that we voted for none you gotta
do the same thing we did last time nuns
gonna win so let's try to let's try to
do the backup I went first last time so
I'll give you honors
we should keep our arguments in shorter
to by the way yes I'm gonna say 1 to 2
I'm a reasonable man or woman cuz I feel
like most people have a good head on
their shoulders and they're not gonna
splurge okay I feel like three three to
five is still reasonable but one to two
it seems it seems more like you know
because there are a lot of good deals
but not always on the games you want if
you kind of have to have both right so
you need you need both of those to line
up so to speak so I think one to two
games I could see myself seeing one to
two games on the summer Steam sale that
we're like cheap like way cheaper than
they usually are and games that I've
been wanting to play or have been
wanting to own for a long time I'm gonna
go with that answer because that's what
I would choose personally okay
compelling argument I'm gonna go with
three to five because I kind of agree if
you're in that just a few games range
you're probably 50/50 between one to two
and three to five also with steam summer
sale there's lots of games that are like
you know $0.99 or 250 or something like
that and if it's a game you've heard
good things about you know you're very
likely just because sure you know it's
just a couple bucks and which is also a
very good you know a good thing about
the Steam sale I think yeah you know you
can you can but fair point a bit all
right we were right that none was gonna
win and you were right that 1 to 2 was
going to be the second place whoo I was
only 5 percent behind you though 20
percent of the vote you're glad and
there's only 56 11 percent of you guys
who were who are just like Steve yes 50
60 buy all the games buy the games and
play a couple of them I bought five
copies of one game once
cheers Cheers so all right and then the
the final question which is does your
primary desktop have a side panel window
now for this question I was thinking
that we you and I would pick a
percentage like in you know divisible by
10 oh so change to the rule so that way
you couldn't be like 70% and I'd be like
71% right so at least it has to has to
be at least 10% away from each other
you can't do like a prices right type of
like cheat okay let me come think I get
what you're saying
so if you put 70 I can't pick 71 or 69 I
can't do that I have to pick either 80
percent or 60 percent okay I'm be honest
I'm gonna say 62 percent yes 62 percent
of them have side panel windows yeah all
right you're gonna be surprised too
accurate that is I'm giving myself a
plus 2 minus 2 percent
I just I'm very confident right now dude
are you really
I don't know why I even don't know why
I'm being facetious we'll find out now
I'm nervous now what do I do
have we gotta go I take it back and they
go plus ten or minus ten 62% no I take
it back I'm gonna do 63% no I can't do
that
I'm gonna do I'm gonna do 75% 75 yeah
all right say that yeah cuz I'm that
confident that I'm right you better
because you just like that's a strategic
just waste that you just did no no it's
not I mean you saw how Linus gave us
like you know infinite time to benchmark
then we saw how it and they still won
totally all right all right here it is
here it is all right
oh damn oh wow
shut your mouth sorry okay rip I'm so
sorry so sorry headphone users that's
just the closest I've ever been to
anything in my life that was really
guessing that was very big moment for me
I'm actually kind of surprised let's
just hit refresh here I was sure that
you would damage there's still so many
forest update like real-time Hey alright
so that's a that's a good three quarters
of you guys who have sight panel windows
on the case which is I don't know what I
know what it was about 62 it just like
stuck out to you so yeah sometimes those
numbers just they call your name is
trying to use a secret just be a guess I
have this I yeah it almost worked it did
not work so you have to take another sip
sir
alright of your beers and terrible way
there we'll put a thing you guys very
much for participating in ask
let me know what you thought in this
segments if you enjoyed it maybe you'll
do it some more in the future if not
I'll just scrap it we'll never have to
do it again thank you by the way for all
your donations again we'll get to those
at the end of this half of the show
let's move on to though to our next
segment which is PIP my PC this is where
you guys tweet me me and Paul your your
beloved pcs pictures of your computers
and we rate them and we rate the crap
out of them
race RIT first person Justin Berfield at
Justin with a 6600 K every 212 Evo and
rx 488 gig that's worth that's like
liquid gold right there
crypto mine who cares by computers and
pull that graphics card out sell it
right now for like twice the cost of
your actual build I'm just kidding
I mean I mean you could but you really
could practically speaking you probably
still want to use your gaming computer
as evil in 73 motherboard 16 gigs of
Crucial Ballistix memory a fan text and
2 pro case all right looking looking
pretty clean cable management wise I
would say yeah no I agree
um I think the I don't know why but
those like the the fully transparent
fans now a little tacky to me okay
that's a personal thing there yeah some
people love him and I used to think they
were cool um we only have a single image
here right so I feel like I don't know I
feel like I like my fans in my system to
match so I would probably make them like
get more of those those white fan texts
chance would performing fans too it's
possible these are like LED fans or
something that's common with the clear
ones yeah but I I look at clear fans
like clear heels right they're just they
show you that maybe maybe there's a
little bit more porn on this computer
than is healthy so I'm saying so clear
fans are an indication that your housing
a ton of porn that's what I'm saying
makes sense that is that is the
accusation I'm making right now I didn't
know where you're going or but now I get
it or you could just look at it like
clear heels little tanky that's true
right or superhot or a superhot if
you're in this trip are you bruh hot
alright yeah you can take it to the
tiniest bit of cable management for
fan cable up here do that when you swap
out these clear fans other than that
everything everything looks really clean
you know not even very dusty yeah yeah
almost like he dusted it just for the
show
draaga holic pronouncing that correctly
you've got an i5 4690k tato 750 750 GTX
750 I had imagined to find mini C is
gorgeous yes it's it's a very lovely
case from fractal design and Gatorade um
and and gate there's lots of orange
Gatorade on that table let's see
okay so cable management it could be
improved a little bit I feel like the
USB 3.0 cable that's coming off your
motherboard could maybe go into the same
grommet that your 24 pin ATX cables
coming out of yeah instead of routing it
to the very bottom of the case swap your
sanic cables the red the red is not
doing much for me sticks out like a sore
thumb yeah I I would agree they even
have a light blue SATA cables pretty
easy to come back and it would match
what's already in here once you okay
what's your opinion on the stickers on
the i/o up here the intel and the
element audio labels here like i would
initially want to say yeah heat gun
those off but then I look at them and
I'm like hey yeah the blue accent
actually man actually with everything
you know maybe it's okay cuz the thing
is like the thing is like if I don't
notice it out right then it's not a big
deal yeah and the thing is like I didn't
even notice those stickers until you man
okay okay so yes you're looking for
things to point out so don't worry about
those so and invest occurs are cool
there's also do you even have okay you
got some know also amp up the look of
your system again just for aesthetics
would be maybe to get some similar items
that are the blue flavor Gator it's like
it it would match with everything get
the berry blast Gator berry blast
Gatorade that's in there and then
also maybe upgrade your memory kit to
something that's got a little bit more
Flair perhaps maybe some like some of
those light blue heat spreaders
cuz right now I don't think oh oh yeah
yeah pretty berry pretty bare-bones for
some reason I thought the blue accents
on the mother of memory heat spreaders
but yeah but
yeah I mean just if you wanted to spice
up the look of it overall that's
something you could do I think the main
thing you want is a berry blue Gatorade
Beverly iterated and everything will
match perfectly and we'll ignore
everything else thanks chocoholic thanks
drugged and then we've got one Baker
Keith with an i-5 7500 ZOTAC GTX 1070 16
gigs of DDR 4 and ASRock b250 pro 4
motherboard man Tex p400 case cry reg
age 7 cooler at Corsair whites oh and of
course our white LED AF 120 fans
providing some LED accents all right we
got a wide shot here and that's thumbs
are cool yeah this is the only the only
shower so I'm cable management here
looks I mean so ok the 24 pin and PCIe
look perfect
I'm coming from your motherboard and
graphics card but all the little or the
smaller cables yeah they like the one
from your CPU cooler I think there's two
cables actually coming from there no
it's no this is one global oh it goes
down here loops back around goes under
the 24 pin and comes back in and plugs
in yeah so I would rather just help I
would rather route that above the cooler
and fastest or route it under here than
man and you can go straight up here and
pass it through some of these grommets
up here and then pop it out to plug it
in right there yeah how how does this
happen
how does someone have such a nice
clean-looking 20 foot like obviously
there's attention paid to cable
management here like with these
extensions or whatever custom sleeping
or whatever is going on it jarring and
then this right here what it's like it's
like a trained PC building professional
started building a system and then his
little like 5 year old brother took over
and finished the job yes
alright so little schizophrenia you like
to fix that we need to fix the loose
cable coming off of the rear exhaust you
can hear this also you should be able to
pass up kind of behind that 120 and just
just plug it in through there if you
have to plug it into an awkward place on
the motherboard maybe try to pass it
along underneath the CPU cooler that's
the way you
can do that or just get most of it
bunched up underneath and there's just a
straight line across here this just
looks a little lazy yeah take take
advantage of that big CPU cooler tower
there like it can hide it can hide a
good amount of cabling yeah and then I
don't know what you can maybe do with
these front cables here as well
obviously you had to replace these fans
so if there's any other way you can pass
them back to the rear I feel like there
should be that I feel like in this in
the enthu Pro yeah there should be
another little cutout maybe right just
adjacent to the fans that's good we
can't see here but there's probably a
little pass-through for fan cables
because what you're passing it through
right now is sort of like the hard drive
wall that you can put modular hard drive
trays in there and that's really what
that's for it's something really meant
to be a cable routing hole so chances
are and maybe you did that because you
couldn't physically like the wire wasn't
long enough the actual cable wasn't long
enough to reach one of the the fan
header possible too but I mean if you
can get if you got the PSU extensions
then you know little fan you know three
pin or four pin fan extensions those
yeah those are super cheap so yeah buy
those so you can route the cables where
you should exactly thank you very much
for that Keith we appreciate lithic
lilyc he said thanks to you Paulin J's
here's my first built at i-5 with a gtx
750ti 16 gigs of ram pimp my pc alright
that is a substantial msi cooler what
that custom I did he take that from like
a prebuilt like a gun em aside pre-built
do they even have a don't know the thing
I don't know I've never seen that people
in chat what's going on with the CPU
cooler is that it does MSI me because
looking under here it looks like a
aluminum fin not like terribly high ends
tower air cooler but why would that have
this like fancy MSI cap on it with the
LED background and everything
the fans the fan alright so it's
probably just the angle of it but I feel
like definitely you want to swap the fan
of the other
side right yeah like I'm in there I
first off like that I always say do an
AV comparison because the temperatures
may very well be the same as a personal
preference I just like the way that it
looks to have the fan on the right side
of the heatsink
can't they open because I just feel like
it when you have it on the left side of
the heatsink it just seems a little too
close to the it's like what I don't know
it's like you already have a rear
exhaust fan so why are you gonna put
another fan that's just like two inches
away from it do you know what I mean
yeah look I feel like it makes more
sense to put it on the right side just
to space them out a little bit more so
whatever cables are going across the
front of that here that might fix that
tuck that away outside all right now
obviously you're dealing with the micro
ATX motherboard in a full-size ATX case
so there's not a whole lot you can do
about these cables down here because you
don't want to not have your front tire
plugged in your USB or audio or anything
like that so again not much you can do
there besides getting a full sized
motherboard you hamed but I'll be damned
MSI Slyke for frozer L which is the CPU
cooler we're seeing here which is a $50
tower with an LED MSI logo on the top of
it yeah I did not know this existed
until today how much you're probably
paying 20 bucks for that LED MSI logo
thinking that stuff yeah I can't do that
can I believe that this is I can't see
this cooling better than like a class
right here yeah a 7-hour hyper 212 Evo
or something like that right but I mean
who knows maybe it's awesome for some
reason all right other than that I mean
I don't know what to tell you about this
like your cable management is is is a
little loose but like there's not a
whole lot you can do about it
you skew you you have that you have a
you have a nice-looking little system I
don't think you're gonna have it looking
like one of the Suites super-premium top
and looking systems without upgrading a
few components inside so or the case
there you go or the case that could be a
thing to the dims dims can be read yeah
I feel like it so you know what the side
panel on here and some lights look
intruments
and you got a pretty cool like led LED
mouse there that you know that's okay I
think that's I think the OE yeah those
are blue LEDs right okay I can also see
your reflection taking the pictures of
Mitch mansion we see you we see you
Olympic all right thanks for the thick
next up we were Rick record
oh hey so this is a micro ATX build
which I always get excited when I see
micro ATX systems on pin my PC we don't
see them nearly enough thanks for
overlaying the image with your specs yes
very hand it's very visually for the
audience that's fantastic indeed so this
is like this is like a budget build with
a Z on which is also a pretty awesome
cuz the e3 1231 what is that a fork or
eight thread and pretty sure it's a fork
for I'm not a three while you're looking
that up he's also got a sapphire nitro
r9 390 excellent card I really love that
card 32 gigs do you say over there on
keyboard with jowls and 1600 megahertz
ddr3 crucial b100 256 gig SSD he's got
two of those perhaps in raid 0 2
terabyte Seagate Barracuda hard drive
7200 rpm and I can see here how you've
sort of managed to just solve the issue
of GPU said you've actually used what
looks to be like a film canister that
looks like a film canister to me yeah
some sort of cylindrical black thing I'm
fine lens in it totally blends I like it
ok he's actually sandwiched his cables
just rendering down you cinches cinches
it down a bit yeah I like that that's
utilitarian right there yeah the Xeon e3
1231 by the way is a fork or eight
thread CPU three point four gigahertz
base and turbos up to three point eight
gigahertz and costs from my
understanding significantly less than
what you pay for like something like a
6700 K or something like that you know
this socket is this 1151 socket I'm not
positive either sorry I don't I don't
follow these young speed but as well I'm
as you know to the mainstream it's 1150
socket so it's it's a it's one
generation socket wise behind but
other than that it is water-cooled with
the push-pull configuration so yeah I
bet it stays at a 120 I bet those fans
like you can keep those fans of like 400
rpm and then you're probably totally
fine the whole driveway looks really
nice I mean here's please yeah I mean
really really the only thing you can do
here to make everything look super
pretty is gonna be some sleeves
extension cables
maybe reseat that lower bracket there
for you to point five inch track because
it's a little out of whack and ones out
of whack it's just sold just figured
it's got a squeeze that little plug
there and it fixed that uh yeah but
really nice clean-looking built even
like how the SATA cables are like like
blue light blue and match everything
else oh yeah it's nice that's the nice
little accent good touch all right
thanks
sir mr. Rick and then finally we've got
one more just a quick changeover from
our good buddy Jacob yay he sent in his
picture of his system right now this is
what it's looking like I'm thinking you
know this looks great I write an X X 5 I
I joked that it was a we had just seen
the first leaked images of one nanometer
oh yeah they were really shrinking down
the amount of power you can get in a
superpower period said this is that
temperature below freezing on air yes
it's so cute I think this is one of the
USB flash drives that Nvidia was yeah
handing off they made a limited number
here's the joke it's very awesome flash
drives it was a April Fool's joke that
eventually got so much demand that they
started handing him out at e3 in limited
quantities it's a 64 gig USB 3 flash
drive I believe I would still love to
get my hands on one of them and do a
thorough review I want one me too Jacob
give us one send send us them Jacob send
us all the all the drives public flash
drives and a kingpin GTX tonight yeah
that'd be great go ahead and follow
Jacob on Twitter everyone at EVGA
underscore Jacob F he is the friggin
when it comes to EGA Jake it was pretty
rare knowledge and stuff he's great guy
ah
next up news news news about tech news
last segment we are it's 626 right now
hungry ok am d radeon RX vega allegedly
very power hungry grey according to an
msi rep who remains anonymous this is
according to WCC of tech the msi rep
claimed i've seen the specs of radeon RX
Vega it needs a damn lot of power that
was the exact quote that I'm not
paraphrasing that's verbatim the quotes
what accent is that that was a like Sean
Connery there was a path I've seen my
focaccia view where is the veteran from
Georgia plague of the 21st century Judge
John Connor ear and of course that
sounds like ok Oh Yoda Yoda Connery
comes from celebrity jeopardy which
isn't even really Sean Connery that's
true just all right Adam board for Adam
port there adding board partners are
starting to receive mega samples which
means the long awaited launch is
imminent it is it's supposed to launch
in late too late too late like July
words so soon AMD has detailed three
Vega 10 based cards each with at least a
300 watt TDP a whopping amount requiring
dual 8 pin power connectors this is all
rumor and hearsay and stuff perhaps the
higher TVP is speculated to be necessary
due to maintaining higher clock speeds
for longer periods of time this is kind
of what we've already seen with the
Radeon Vega Frontier Edition which we'll
be talking about more on Paul's half of
the show this is a workstation Vega GPU
but it has a ridiculously high TDP as
well for the same reasons we've just
discussed trying to maintain that higher
clock speed for longer periods of time
100 or 375 Watanabe Air Liquide
yeah depending on error liquid-cooled
again we'll be discussing that more
later on and you compare that people
already comparing it to the GTX 1080
I from Nvidia and that's a 250 watt TDP
card which has 8 plus 6 pin plugs and
can already clock well beyond reference
speeds without much sweat without
breaking a sweat so um so far it seems
Vegas seems to take a small backseat
when it comes to power efficiency of
course we're gonna have to test these
ourselves to really confirm that but at
very least if you are planning on
picking up a Vega 10 based GPU from from
Nvidia from AMD soon then you might
wanna you might want to beef up your
power supply if you're not rocking at
least 750 850 watts
I feel like Vega like it's already
starting to and even with like skylake X
with the higher tvp's like there used to
be like no need for anything below 750
watt and then you know like above like
like like below I felt like you know
systems like back in 2011 2012 they
weren't nearly as perfect in GPUs and
snow and then like and then like yeah
like way back then and then now all of a
sudden it's like you know Pascal is like
super power efficient it's like you can
go get away with like a 450 500 watt
power supply and now we're kind of going
back to the old way where we've got
Scylla kicks that which is incredibly
power hungry especially if you're
overclocking and now we've got Vega
which is pulling over 300 Watts TDP
allegedly and we're gonna have to we're
probably gonna see more models come out
you know in the 750 to 850 watt range so
things are things are changing things
are changing and they're changing things
all right let's move one of the next
data everything's so confused you know
what at least you're not asleep I'm not
asleep because I'm I consider this a win
because I'm not jet lagged anymore Cal
that's true
don't blame me for jet lag this is true
and it does to me I just I was very self
consciousness when you fell asleep
during my half or so I thought I can't
telling you I wasn't actually asleep I
was pretending to be asleep nobody
believes me I was pretending I knew I
knew I was falling asleep and as I own
to pretend to fall asleep right now
you're full of moment that's
exactly what happened I hate you all
right perspective Nvidia partners are
launching some mining focused GPUs this
is very exciting sort of if you're into
currency mining this is a yes from from
PC perspective as Paul mentioned now AMD
is not the only one here jumping on the
cryptocurrency bandwagon as Nvidia as a
lot of you've probably heard by now
Nvidia and their partners and its
partners are launching mining optimized
video cards based on GP 106 and GP 104
GPUs GP 106 of course being the GPU
featured in the GTX 1060 GP 104 being
featured in the gtx 1070 so these are
now in production they are on their way
to market they will feature cheaper
costs overall for the end user hopefully
no geforce gtx branding these are not
gaming centric cards meaning that they
will also have little to no video
outputs which is kind of interesting and
shorter warranties Nvidia is imposing a
three month warranty on several of these
cards which is not really very long at
all three months not very long at all
the P the P 106 100 which is the the
code name of the GPU now know like like
also P 106 they remove the G meaning
that it's not a geforce card
alright so based on the code name we're
just talking about a non gaming centric
card here but these have already been
spotted from the folks over at asus EVGA
MSI's otech colorful and in o3d they've
all been spotted online these P 106
cards but power delivery has or I'm
sorry yeah power delivery has been sort
of bolstered to keep the cards mining
smoothly 24/7 so even though you can
overclock them you might not be able to
achieve stability as easily because the
kind of dumb down the power delivery
system just to make them more stable at
the reference speed bolstered bolstered
bolstered means improved
sorry I got that backwards yes you're
right bolstered to keep the kind yeah
okay so instead of yeah okay
instead of dumbing it down they've
actually stepped it up sorry my didn't
mean to call you out they my bad I'm
apparently big on the definitions and
using fancy words at everything today
yeah but you and your damn words I swear
to God but but the basic idea is that
most graphics cards I mean most graphics
cards especially that their party
versions that you get can run 24/7 no
problem but they're not necessarily
designed specifically for that so what
they're saying here is it that by using
potentially more power phases or higher
in power phases they can set the the
graphics cards to be able to run for
longer periods of time so the actual
power delivery doesn't get us warm and
yeah these are these are specific
purpose-built cards it also seems like
and I'm just speculating but they might
be able to use potentially GPUs that
didn't make the cut for use in their
full-fledged graphics cards if they
weren't able to maintain high enough
frequencies or if they weren't just
according to the they usually take every
GPU and run it through a series of tests
if it wasn't living up to all those
tests they're potentially able to take
those GPUs and put them in these
graphics cards because again they have
lower want a shorter warranties and
everything like that which all things
considered would be good because if they
can make these kinds of graphics cards
and cryptocurrency miners can scoop them
up then that hopefully means that maybe
there's been there they're scooping up
less of the graphics cards that are
meant for gamers because there's a huge
shortage right now because gamers who
want to buy graphics cards or a really
hard tough position right now yeah you
if you want to buy a card for gaming
specifically you're either forced to buy
you're either forced to overpay like a
lot for one like gtx 1070 is right now
are going for almost $500 on popular
retailers and some for like seven or
eight hundred bucks on yeah those are
from the third dealers right but Stewart
who are terrible terrible people and the
fact that they're selling for that
amount means that some people are buying
them for the
which is crazy or or they're just
completely out of stock like if you look
up rx4 70s or five 60s I think on new
Haley a lot of the AMD cards are just
completely sold out I feel like the
Nvidia cards right now have been seeing
more of a price surge but the AMD ones
are just flat-out not available because
they've already been eaten up by all
these crypto miners which is pretty
insane so hopefully the this new
onslaught of mining specific cards can
sort of restore balance and and market
availability for gaming centric GPUs I
hope so and also lower the prices a bit
for the average consumer so they're not
paying out the ass just to play some
video games but building on top of this
article sapphire is actually the first
one to market with an AMD based crypto
card so we're moving away from Nvidia at
this point but this is a five new skis
that we're seeing featuring the rx 470
and the rx 560 ranging from and the
prices that I'm giving you right now
I've converted from great British pounds
DVP so this is a $220 us for the RX 560
and three up to up to three hundred and
eighty five us for an RX 470 that seems
really pricey to me and I'm not sure if
that's just how much they're like if
there's a sort of premium that you have
to pay in in in GBP or if that's really
how much it's gonna be when it comes
when it comes to the US as well $300 for
an RX Forks 470 seems pretty crazy I
mean if they're talking about current
prices they're probably potentially
inflated yeah but who knows for sure
yeah only the the RX 560 out of these
five SKUs will have a video output in
the form of a DVI a DVI port and two of
the models that we've talked about two
of these models will support Samsung
memory chips which are known to clock
higher than the is it
Elpida oppaya what LP Deverell Piper
opener al-qaeda is alternative which is
supposed to be slightly better for
mining one-year warranty on these cards
which is three times as long as a three
month and
cards and I guess one issue if you're
gonna be buying into this whole craze is
that it might be difficult to eventually
flip or sell these cards back to gamers
once you're done with them or once you
realize crypto mining isn't working out
for you or if like all the rates
suddenly drop and they stay dropped and
you want to get rid of your cards it's
gonna be hard to flip those cards
because of their limited IO they don't
have HDMI out or the DisplayPort out for
example most of them don't even have any
video outputs the ones that do have DVI
and that's kind of an outdated port at
this at this point when it comes to
high-end gaming so bear that in mind if
you were thinking about flipping these
eventually if it doesn't work out for
whatever reason it might be a bit more
difficult to do so but that's not all we
can talk about here there's also been a
critical flaw discovered in sixth and
seventh generation what are you laughing
about
trying to keep Hiro from cutting the
audio oh for the entire show is he
tripping on wires down he was lying down
on the power cord for the for the sound
board here so I just briefed concerned
that he would pull it out and pull the
plug out of the socket but everything's
okay now
okay he's a big dog so there's been a
critical flaw discovered in skylake and
kb lake hyper-threading and this is kind
of not I mean not a huge issue this is
from hot hardware and the new flaw has
been discovered it affects most of the
6th and 7th gen Intel CPUs that support
hyper threading regardless of operating
system so doesn't matter if you're on
Linux or Windows or whatever you are
subject to experiencing this flaw the
issue was discovered or disclosed on the
Debian Linux user list and was sent out
with a warning notification the problem
as stated says under complex micro
architectural conditions short loops of
less than 64 instructions that use HB h
CH or D H registers as well as their
corresponding wider register may cause
unpredictable system behavior this can
only happen when both logical processors
on the same physical processors are
actives
along in short of this what you need to
know is that these errors can cause
anything from system lock ups to data
corruption loss there are certain little
issues that might cause your system to
malfunction if you have hyper-threading
enabled on either a cabling why are you
why are you smiling not smiling yes
you're giving a weird creepy smile just
nodding in agreement with it that you're
in sight and we just can't wait for me
to be over done so that you can do your
after the show and that we can eat
afterwards that's all you care about
that's exactly what I think perfect
which is totally justified I don't blame
you don't move
do you've seen right through me and
getting hungry myself um all right so um
basically you shouldn't panic though
even though these processors are clearly
plagued with flaws and and and just
tragedy intel has confirmed that the
chance of users experiencing anything
negative from this issue are very slim
because it requires a complex number of
concurrent micro architectural
conditions to reproduce so only in very
rare instances would you be struck with
some some issue regarding this flaw um
they've also said that they've
identified and addressed the issue with
a fix that started rolling out in April
which was a couple months ago so now
it's up to the board partners really to
release this fix within like BIOS
updates UEFI updates so that users can
download it and patch everything up so
it's fixed via a micro kit maker could
update that would be in this via a BIOS
update absolutely okay
still the Linux distro dvn recommends
disabling hyper-threading as a
precaution until you get a solid fix so
that's pretty much it no one you guys
hopefully no one's been affected by it
mmm the last story we can skip we're
skipping are just really quick really
quick look at this since you already
looked at IBM's 5 nanometer chip could
quadruple battery life the long and
short here is that they've been working
with Samsung and Global Foundries to
develop a 5 nanometer chip which is
going to be 40% of a performance gain
gained over existing tanana meter chips
at the same power level or up to 75%
power savings at the current generations
level of performance so
if this was built into any sort of
battery-powered device you could see
some insane this is all theoretical to
some insane battery savings battery life
savings I should say we we've discussed
several battery saving groundbreaking
technologies in the past I feel like
none of them have really become or taken
off or become mainstream so this could
just be another pipeline dream but it is
always nice to fantasize once in a while
about having a smartphone that could
last you an entire week off of one
charge for example we can dream we can
dream Paul we can dream that's all
that's all gonna say Matt that story
okay there's more to it but we're short
on time I have nothing dad and Paul has
nothing to add he absolutely hates the
show and he hates all of you I don't
know I just you see he just didn't
understand it at all so well thank you
very much Paul let's read off some quick
donations here thank you
Oda hang rings out for the five dollars
Oh Oh - OH - hain rinse or sorry if I'm
butchering that only donating to hear
you guys butcher my name again
absolutely keep Italy awesome work guys
well I'm sure we did not disappoint that
time around honey oh honey Scott with
these 6.66 donate 66 cents donation the
super metal should I sell my Strix eight
gig rx4 80s to miners and by a single
1080 and if I didn't make it into my PC
again I'm using my toaster as a bath
bomb don't do that you should always try
again prepare my PC I prefer that -
suicide death and uh do you I wouldn't
be opposed to you selling the RX for ATS
honestly now would be a great time to
sell our export Amy's just showed the
how much it costs to buy a gtx 1070
right now that 10 eighties aren't far
behind that yeah but if you can find
okay if you can find a GTX 10 you can
five hundred five hundred to five
hundred fifty dollars then yes the price
even if it's a slightly inflated price
for the 1080 tocrawl I'd be able to sell
the RX 4 80s for any
profit all right Lee well you gotta $10
B recommendation Khanna boys we didn't
get pizza did we know I don't know what
they're breaking it think it's mine
and then it could be my wife yeah it
could be my wife I don't know I don't
know is that usually the sound they make
when your wife comes home that's the
sound they make when they think anyone's
at the door which sucks because like
hero makes this like hey you know yeah
he makes us really wimp very nice that's
not as normal bark
she has he has a fear inducing like like
like like really deep guttural bark that
he does like when he sees someone
through the fence or something like that
let him do that was for the door though
he just isn't you know I'd never heard
hero bark ever I feel like one of these
days no it's very it's very satisfying
I'm sure it exhaust on a super-deep all
right
thanks brother thank you very much for
the chair recommendation Kona Brewing
Hanalei IPA I don't know if I've had
that one before I've had gonna bring
before I actually went to their brewery
in Hawaii once it was very good
Halloween I will try their IP sometime
thank you for the donation I appreciate
it plus the magic dragon Buffett
automatic mat again for the consistent
five dollar donation with Ozzy mat hey
guys I was wondering what your top three
favorite cases were also when you think
the GPU prices might drop so first off
from the GP prices I think that will
drop once cryptocurrency sort of dies
down or if we can get a lot of those
mining cards out and those sell well and
and people actually buy into that then I
feel like that's when we're gonna start
to see normalcy no malice see whatever
the you want to call it favorite
three cases Paul just without any
explanation just like give me give us
the names so I'm gonna say for budget
Eclipse p400 from from fantex I like
this be quiet silent bass 900 silent
bass 900 I have to say the define s cuz
hotlines in it okay those are three
that's three cases three cases we win
fred rent for the $5 donation make sure
your wife is ready for this week's $100
challenge you will need a large glass of
water I will be sure to not pass that
information I'd rather save that for
next week because please do Helens life
is only here when we're broadcasting
from Kyle's place this is true from my
place that's true but my wife is not
here right now so no wives can hit what
we can yeah uh Fred grant another $5
donation you pulled a prank on her with
the water on keyboard she gets to pour a
glass of water over your head for $100
maybe I mean depend I mean I'd do it for
a hundred it's been dead yeah we'll see
take a shower
Erica's rule $10 is business watching
since nick days thanks for teaching me
about custom PC building over the years
yo Derek you're very welcome
I'm glad if you've learned anything from
us I'll have peer reviews five dollar
donation happy to support you guys
cheers from FFA hey we met him we met
hands we didn't know happy Thank You El
Jefe yeah thanks man profit 168 $10 sup
dudes check your mail soon local Grand
Rapids beers on the way okay with a
question about overclocking in Oris g5 x
370 with a 1600 x well in OS
overclocking yield the same results as
bios my reads are way off
oh well overclocking the OS dealed the
same results yeah it should
there should be minimal difference there
unless you're using like an automatic
overclocking software like from ACS for
example yeah then that's sort of dynamic
it's whatever the software deems is
appropriate versus you doing it yourself
but if you're just doing it manually
either way in the OS or the BIOS I've
done it both ways and pretty much the
results are indistinguishable of each
other
yeah thanks thanks for the beer on the
way
Thank You profit can't wait to drink it
Cody for the $10 donation that's got off
a flight and saw you guys we're on I
won't be able to watch on the road but
I'll have a beer and catch up when I get
home Cheers thanks go to will see an
encode appreciate event hayden Haslam $7
I own two GTX 1060 cards I want to game
on one and use the other for an HTTP see
which one do I choose to game on the
EVGA for the win or the gigabyte or is
extreme non gigabit per second um I've
game on the nine gigabits per second one
because you can probably overclock that
sucker to match the EVGA for the wind
speeds but the nine gigabits per second
memory is probably gonna help you more
in games than it would you know I would
say it play back cover Clark both of
them and see which one maintains the
higher frequency just do any comparison
with always works - yeah thank you very
much though Hayden next we've got Takaya
flash to the $5 hi Oh tuck hi I think
you've all read stuck hi you guys are
awesome keep the great videos coming PS
first stream welcome thank you for being
here hope it wasn't as disappointing as
you thought it would be deck Mac deck
bag $5 thanks guys keep up the good work
thank you Dad thank you appreciate it
Zachary way $10 couldn't get an RX 580
so wait what Eric's 570 I really think
of it other than 1050 TI paired with an
i5 6600 for my budget build like gaming
and editing love your channels couldn't
have built the PC without you guys um
let's see
10cc I paired with a 6600 I mean it
gives you an upgrade path because I'm
mainly 600 will last you a while
honestly you're dealing with current GPU
prices which are really tough to
navigate so if you can find the 1050 Ti
more reasonably priced than an Rx 570
which I guarantee you probably can
although the 1050 eyes are probably
overpriced - then yeah you should
probably go with that stick with
something you can get up and running for
for the minimal price right now weights
up prices even out or get back to them
to normal to get something else yeah
that's what I would suggest but thank
you very much for that donation Zachary
next we got Zach Gambrills for the 6
dollars and 90 cent donation Kyle you're
looking snazzy as hell where'd you get
that shirt I got this from north
well aren't we fence I went to the mall
and I bought a shirt is it from
Nordstrom Rack I probably do it no I
think it's just regular Nordstrom lar
wait fancy I know that by the way it
happens less frequently than like a
lunar eclipse oh well you ever spot me
at the mall it's like it's like like you
found like the super rarest Pokemon in
the most rare hard-to-reach I really I
really hate them all me too
a serpent s our serpent xsf $5 I am
going for a m4 mini ITX bill should I
grab a bio starboard or wait from where
options and do i pair with an r7 1700 or
r5 1600 X or X or not X I would say in
our 7 1700 you could well it doesn't
really matter I mean the 1700 you're
gonna get two more cores and four more
threads then you would with the 1600 I
feel like the 1600 non X is a better
deal because you just overclocked it to
hit the same frequency or there abouts
so yeah honestly it depends on your
budget as well you can save some money
by going the six core route with the
1600 which is a fantastic CPU I don't
know it's just not knowing anything off
the bat I would say 1600 9x that sounds
reasonable
yeah and when it comes to more options
there's a gigabyte board that just
launched and more on that I might have
for the show
mm-hmm okay indirect way true $5 which
is better a 180 millimeter rad for 90
millimeter fans or 180 millimeter fans
say the one fan does hundred best see
yeah these are these are very specific
fans but very specific questions about
very specific fan configurations which
is a very difficult question to answer
you stop of our heads it honestly
depends there's lots of different
hundred and eighty millimeter fans
looking at cubic feet per per minute as
far as airflow goes
this I can't I can't answer this
question do they even have they have 180
millimeter rats I didn't even know that
no I've seen I've seen 180 millimeter
infinite millimeter rats that were built
that were like one-off things but I mean
they exist they're out there really
fascinated yeah sorry sorry and Ray hue
that we couldn't answer that better but
thank you for the donation on the West
Hayden again for the five bucks I posted
a moment ago about the 10 60s but do you
guys have any idea why no SLI from the
10 60s I feel like that would be a
pretty good combo I feel like Nvidia
sort of latched on to the trend in
recent years that people really only SLI
or crossfire higher-end cars because
really that's that's that's a that's um
if you there's been a huge emphasis on
just buying the fastest single GPU
because it's more compatible and it's
gonna work more consistently the
performance is gonna be more consistent
from game to game because not all titles
are going to support multi GPU and even
the ones that do sometimes they don't
scale all that well so at like multi-gpu
setups in recent years has really been
reserved for those trying to push the
envelope of performance to the very
maximum amount so when you get a gtx
1080i where can you really go from there
there's like apart from the titan x low
p there's really no other model of
graphics card that supersedes that or
that surpasses that in terms of
performance so you just slot another one
in there if you wanted more performance
than what a gtx 1060 could offer then
the more practical and sensible solution
would be to just buy a faster graphics
card like a 1070 or 1080i or 1080p i and
so forth so I feel like for that reason
like Nvidia is just like screw it we're
not going to spend more time and in
development on a doing support for SLI
on this lower powered card and I feel
like at first I was like kind of a
raised eyebrow now I don't I feel like
it makes sense because I've never ever
recommended someone go go and buy two
mid-range cards and
multi-gpu setup because the idea of SLI
is much much more common than people
actually implementing SLI yes I think
what we can come down to for me but you
know also a good answer from Kyle Thank
You Hayden Haslam next to sixty six
racer was a twenty five dollar donation
and says love your contents you also
write here I need to point out something
because we've gotten a few of these kind
of recently if you guys are sending us
nominations please don't do it to
promote your YouTube channel or your
website or anything like that because
we're not gonna read it that's pretty
much what it comes down to we've gotten
a few of those recently we got to cut
those out these are really here for
people to ask us questions if you want
to get our response to them it's not
really here for you guys to buy
promotion and I'm not trying to talk
down your anything it's just something
that we have to establish it I feel that
it's true 66 Racer thank you so much for
your donation and I'm really glad you
enjoy our content indeed Sweeney PC
sweet EP for the 5ds building home plex
server with horizon 1600 for 1080p 4k
transcoding how important is ECC for 27
24/7 use should I go Xeon for ECC more
for dollar equals performance ECC and my
experience would be important if you're
building something like an ass or
something where data integrity is
extremely important
yeah if you're building a plex server
you're dealing with media files which
you know if you skip a bit here there
it's probably not a big deal you know
you might have a glitch in a video or
something like that I would say the ECC
is probably less important in your
specific configuration hero just looked
my finger and I had no idea what I was
my brain freaked out that's what he does
I felt something wet and cold on my
finger that is I don't know what lost my
 there for a moment yeah Derek to
you for the five million whoa no comment
thanks for the donation thank you sir
take the waffles gameplay $5 bros check
mine out if you done I understand what
that means cool Robert Harrison $5 I
just bought an ex x34 predator and holy
 most of the UT real I followed
don't exploit their videos in 21 by 9
well you guys ever published a 21 by 9
probably
it's a great resolution for gaming I
really like the widescreen thing there
even though the percentage of people who
have the ability to watch in native 21
by 9 is so small it doesn't make sense
to publish videos in that aspect ratio
so we're complication for us for less
ROI yeah but I mean who knows maybe
it'll maybe it'll keep its comes more
mainstream than possibly Luis Herrera
five dollars and sixty nine cents do you
do you think Vega will help stabilize
the high graphics card prices or do you
think they won't be suitable for mining
and won't affect the prices I'm really
really impossible to say it's hard to
say my guess is that they would probably
be decent for mining but I can't I can't
say how much we'll see in the next few
days probably as some of the Vega the
initial big workstation graphics cards
about your new frontier edition reviews
come out and I'm sure people will try
those out for mining for mine I have a
feeling for the price they won't be
practical
definitely no yeah might be ten bucks
thanks guys thank you you're welcome
Mike you're the best okay well here's
ten dollars hey guys my wife and I love
the content that you both put out there
awesome
her birthday is tomorrow and it would be
amazing if you could give her a silly
shout out her name is Emily happy
birthday Emily Emily happy birthday we
love you love you we love you in there
not as much as your husband don't tell
your husband and we said we love you he
may get mad and not give us any more
money
yeah and birthday Emily thought yeah
that's pretty good
Sebastian Casilla for the 20 R's
Argentinian Argentinean pesos yes
sorry i cant donate more steam sale is
killing me everyone well you were the
ten games guy apparently on the survey
that we pulled earlier like Google
Chrome for the five dollars stupid
miners I know why don't they turn 18
already Andrew saw blur five dollars
thank you all for what you do love
watching the show every week
Cheers cheers to us right guys yeah
thanks for the donation nucking futs
i see what you did there five dollars
finally bought a 55 inch 4k HDR Sony
smart TV but now that I can see Paul and
Kyle's face and glorious 4k I'm ready to
downgrade back to tell you well we're
only streaming at 1080 60 right now so
imagine imagine if we totally get to the
native 4k maybe maybe soon maybe soon we
are using my new stream system I didn't
want to point that out or anything like
that because everything's been coming
okay so far yeah how do you look at HDR
by the way that's cool do I look browner
then you thought that HDR I know I mean
it's still yeah it might it might yeah
anyway Russell Russell Purcell time
Dallas $10 sup fellas is a gigabyte six
gigs GTX 1060 more valuable on open
market now than a 970 founders Edition
or which would miners pay more for I
have no idea I don't know honestly I'm
gonna look it up on eBay tens 1060 vs.
970 see what the rate the average rate
is do a little calculation I'll tell you
exactly not gets crazy right now it's
really impossible to like I don't want
to memorize how anything is going right
now because it'll be a bomb for the $25
no sir I have an Origin pro sorry for
the dogs I have an Origin Kronos 6700 K
32 gigs of RAM GTX 1080 family dition
 when should I upgrade not for a
while couple years no please
yeah differently for you good 66 Racer
for them nother another $10 here's
another one because you guys rock off
you route 66 Thank You Dez Jones $5 why
is there such
delay for the EVGA dark motherboard it's
the only thing that would even that I'd
even remotely consider that would even
remotely consider x2 99
I don't know but bear in mind that all
the xc-99 stuff was pulled in as far as
launched like two months early so a lot
of the stuff that was shown is still
pretty early and give it another month
or two and you probably start seeing
everything actually available for sale
yep
Aaron Barlow $10 cheers guys Cheers
Thank You Aaron very much
Aaron Castro $5 hey guys I'm trying to
find our GB RAM for my MSI X 370 gaming
Pro carbon and none are listed on the
QBL what's QBL qualified vendor list is
any recommendation on our GB RAM looking
for three gigahertz plus uh
if you're on an X 370 your us to get
risin g.skill is really good and just go
for surd vengeance LP X is also
validated Corsair and MSI have been
working together for coordinating the
yeah everything so baby the Corsair
stuff yeah Michie skill for sure I've
had good results with them - Grim Reaper
1085 dollars do you think there will be
any decent July 4th sales for GPUs
considering the mining craze well going
to get a GTX 1080 cuz I sold my r9 fury
for monies now people are already paying
out the ass they're not gonna do sales
that's not gonna happen
nope sorry sorry Larry Kent man in nine
one three five six $10 sorry if you
covered this already but what was the
benchmark Cinebench that PC world ran in
there video that showed FPS metrics
around 126 Vega Fe vs. 106 technically
we're talking about that on my half of
the show in just a few moments yep
absolutely so that is gonna conclude all
the donations for today thank you guys
so much or at least on this half of the
show and then we've also got a couple
Johnson shoutouts that we got to rattle
off really quickly here let's see maybe
read a bit of it to be good to be shoot
the boot but about actually I can look
him up on my phone that's probably
better for me I have you read off yours
first for you go you go at 4 Johnson's
first 2 Timothy B from California got a
thumbscrew shirt thank you so much
Timothy next up
oh wow that's a difficult name to
pronounce from also from California avid
just abacus is what I'm going to say I
got a the two glass set of English pub
glasses like we're drinking from sinking
today boys also Pearson from Illinois
got a thumb screw
navy blue shirt and an 11 ounce mug
thank you so much for your order and
your support Craig from Denver Colorado
got a English pub glass a 20 ounce
version do you think it Craig alright
saw you guys and I'll rattle some off
here um I missed some of the names so
let me know if it's a double job
sympathy
Timothy be Tim yes that's a double
digits double jumps and for you Timothy
the garage for very much for freaking
about 15 ounces black ceramic mug
they've also got one from Connie Connie
picked up a CPU cooler shirt Thank You
Kenny and then we've got one from Vlad
is a vladislav I'm sorry I'm butchering
your name vladislav I'm gonna call Youm
essence love I picked up a W CPU cooler
shirt we've also got a new order from AB
oh my goodness AB the gym oh right I
have a gist Evan if he'd say that he
already said in Cho right here that yeah
they right having just nice do your
little Johnson's good with your words
Paul a but you thank you very much
speaking of a CPU cooler shirts it's
still selling pretty well we've got one
from Pearson that's a double Johnson
it's double your sin for picking up a
bit with white logo shirt and a words in
a circle glass set that is a low stock
warning how am i low on that already
okay then we've got one from Andrew
Andrew thank you very much sir Johnson
TV picking up an evolution shirt thanks
Andrew anyway you've got one more from a
Mick mr. Mick for a big of an evolution
and stay positive Church thank you very
much sir
just a couple more here we've got or eat
or it's or or eat either way thank you
for picking over an evolution shirt and
there we go did you merge it you do
Robert Robert Oh Robert I think this
might be the Robert that I know and if
it is what's up Robert
evolution shirt as well a lot of
evolution ships being picked up and then
one from Craig which I believe is a
double Johnson's Vanessa thank you very
much Craig we love you
your craziness for bigger than 80 words
in a circle beautiful glass that is
going to conclude it from my half of the
show laying out we are super long
overdue for part two of this show so
don't go anywhere go ahead and head over
to don't go anywhere but go ahead and
head over to pulse channel which is
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware 4-part
side B of this show if you're on
twitch.tv just stay where you are we're
going to do a continuation will be are
