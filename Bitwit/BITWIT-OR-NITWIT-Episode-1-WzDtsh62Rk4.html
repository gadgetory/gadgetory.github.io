much or whatever oh really how long have
you been watching the channel for about
three four years oh shoot my name is
Phil and I really nice to meet you yeah
nice to meet you too so here's the mesh
if I see that's the case that you that
you were looking to buy today but the
surprises just keep continuing because
if you'll follow me over here I have to
break something to you what I wanted to
do today is is surprise you again with
the potential for winning a gaming PC
that's already fully built this is
episode 1 of a new kind of game show
that we're doing it's like an undercover
game show that work that we're now
calling bit wit or nitwit as as decided
by the fans so if you guys hate that
name blame yourselves and not me but but
this is a gaming PC this is actually
funny story behind this NZXT actually
sent this to me preassembled as one of
their BLD pre-built systems but I
upgraded the graphics card to a gtx 1070
it is rockin the core i5 7600 k so if
you wanted to i don't know if you're on
a super time crunch or anything but
would you want to play the game which
basically consists of answering five
questions all tech related okay and if
you get them all right then you win the
case or you win the system if you if you
happen to strike out you won't win the
system but will still give you the the
case for free the mesh if i see for free
just as a consolation prize okay are you
down yeah I'm totally down for that got
him alright let's do it man
let's do this get a gaming PC fast and
easy with BLD by NZXT pick the
performance and budget that works best
for you and have a meticulously crafted
rig shipped to your doorstep with a
48-hour turnaround BLD offers the latest
hardware fair pricing and a two year
all-in-one warranty so click the link
below to start customizing your next
gaming rig today the game show is fairly
harmless I'm gonna ask you a series of
five questions and there's only two
things you really need to keep in mind
you have 30 seconds to come up with an
answer
they are multiple choice thankfully for
you there
yes yeah and then the other thing is
that we're gonna give you one assist at
any point during the round and that's
going to basically allow you to choose -
multiple choice answers instead of one
to double your odds of answering
correctly okay so you can use this on
any of the five questions you want but
it's a one-time use only so make sure
you use it wisely okay all right well
that's pretty much it
here are your five cards each one with a
question more difficult than the last
okay I'm gonna ask you your first one
aloud and then you'll have 30 seconds to
answer let's get down to it okay
the measure pi C which is the case that
you were planning to buy today is a mid
tower chassis categorised by which form
factor specification is it a micro ATX
the ATX
C Mini ITX or d mega ATX have never
heard of negative 2x well go with the
ATX b ATX is the correct answer cut well
done thank you thank you and you were
just talking about how you were planning
to build your first ATX case yes her
system inside of the other spicy so what
a relevant question question number two
how many gigabytes are in one terabyte
that's a thousand
that would be correct I didn't even have
to read off the multiple choice in fact
I kind of forgot to just assuming that
you would already know and of course you
did so congratulations you're moving on
to question number three which of these
is not something you would typically
find in a graphics card retail box that
a manual a B a molex adapter C a USB
adapter or D port dust covers oh that's
a hard one and remember if you get
tripped up you can use your assist
what are you thinking right now I'm
thinking well every single gun fits
tight definitely has a manual
I definitely have a molex adapter back
at my place because I just bought a GTX
1070
uh-huh the USB adapter I don't think
I've seen that port dust covers port
dust covers are those a thing on the
back curtain thinks okay so deadly comes
with a manual molex adapter I'm stuck in
B or C a USB adapter I don't think I've
ever seen that in a case and I ordered a
graphics card this adapter is it for
like this backwards over are you able to
like help clarify can't really on the
details you just go with your gut
instinct I think as good as the adapter
that is correct aha Oh
we're on to level 4 oh my god that was a
good that was a good guess or that was
even a guess you kind of narrowed it
down you know like with critical
thinking oh I'm a solid man okay you're
doing great okay
question 4 we're getting to the near end
here folks when referring to mechanical
keyboards which Cherry MX switch color
features a distinct clicky sound and a
tactile bump is it a blue B red C brown
or D black
it's growth lagan blue that is correct
it is the blue switch we got one more
here man you are one right answer away
from winning this system which I don't
know it's probably well over a thousand
bucks or so MSRP and you still have your
assist yeah even if you get tripped up
here you're sitting pretty right now oh
my gosh let's do this man right number
five
internal USB 3.0 first became a native
feature on the on which Intel chipset is
it a z68 B z77 C z87 or D z97 okay I
need my assistant list all right you're
using your assist and what are the two
answers that you would like to select
remember as long as you get one of these
two answers correct you win the prize
okay
what are your initial thoughts
I never studied motherboard nemesis all
this may be my downfall you got a 50/50
shot even if you don't know at all
B or C what was that B or C B or C
Philip no no how do I say this
you were correct and this PC is now
officially yours congratulations and you
excellent work you did fantastic and if
you want the measure spicy as well you
can have it for free so win-win I guess
Wow all right cool how you feeling right
now I don't feel anything man it's just
I wasn't expecting just this morning and
holy crap
awesome job congratulations on your new
system what are you planning to play
with it or do with it well that's a good
question
