watch this video it'll probably make
more sense that way because today I'm
gonna be benchmarking it I'm gonna be
going over temps acoustics as well as
the frame rates on some of the latest
titles in today's gaming world all the
hardware in this system is running in
stock clock frequency I haven't tweaked
any of the hardware CPU GPU memory all
that's running at stock I've pretty much
just installed the OS and other
applications that I needed and basically
ran ran the tests so with that said
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
and enjoy the numbers that you see so
here you go

numbers for this system once again this
is the $2,300 epic gaming portable
system that you can't afford and neither
can i but gosh is it beautiful if you

it let me know you guys think of this
system and the results that you saw
today and if you know if you had the
money would you spend it on a rig

configuration would you do differently
because I'm curious to know so leave
