channel today we are building a computer
if you couldn't tell from all the
hardware lying around me but there is a
purpose for it we're not just doing this
for shit's and gigs although I like to
do that sometimes what we're essentially
building a PC for today is to test a
single component and that is this thing
right here this is the power combo from
fantex and I did check this out at CES
back in January and I thought it was
really cool because it's really the
first of its kind that I've seen and
what it essentially allows you to do is
connect to power supplies to a single
motherboard in in a single system so
that's basically for redundancy and the
event of a power failure let's say one
of your power supplies dies your system
can continue running what's going on in
the background ok mono just turned off
don't mind that so in case of a power
failure and one of your units dies your
system will continue running because
it's backed up essentially by a second
connected power supply so just kind of
the same reason more or less why you
would have a raid one set up for your
hard drives for example just for that
peace of mind for done Dhin see you know
instead of data loss recovery you're
essentially recovering power in this
situation so that's going to be kind of
cool to test out and we're not gonna be
able to test it out really until we
build the system so that's why we're
doing it today speaking of the power
supplies that we're using we've got a g7
50 M from coolermaster and in Earth wats
platinum 650 watt from an tech notice
that they are two different wattages
and you can have two different wattages
when connecting to the power combo they
don't need to be identical however each
power supply needs to be powerful enough
and have enough wattage to drive your
entire system by itself otherwise it's
kind of a moot point to have one for
backup additionally we've got a cooler
here I guess I'll just go in no
particular order we've got the fan
Tech's pH TC 14 PE this is an awesome
air cooler again we're going for high
reliability for the system so I didn't
want to mess around with any liquid or
you know water cooling things like that
so no chance of leaking here but this is
a pretty awesome cooler it's very silent
as well
got a gtx 980ti right here from ZOTAC
this is their amp Edition killer card
beast of a card it's definitely going to
be you know power efficient enough to be
driven by either of these power supplies
so that's good we've got a 6700 K from
from Intel of course core i7 so we are
going skylake for this now I could have
gone x99 however I wanted to save that
for Broadwell even that come
because x99 as of now or as well I I
should say is kind of you know being
phased out for broad belly coming up
really soon so but that's going to be
for later videos so stay tuned for that
but I'm pretty sure we're still going to
get some decent performance here with
skylake we've also got 32 gigs of
corsair dominator platinum at 3000
megahertz however I've only got a 16 gig
kit right now there's actually another
16 gig kit on its way right now from
Amazon so I'll be installing that kit
when it gets here we've also got two
SSDs for our storage we've got a boot
drive for our for our system the 850 Evo
SSD which is a 250 gigs as well as a one
terabyte MX 200 from crucial and this is
going to be where all of our RAW files
ideally will be edited off of so let's
say we're doing a video editing system
here it's really much nicer to edit off
of an SSD than a mechanical hard drive
you won't get nearly as many drop frames
and things like that I've also got two
mechanical hard drives of those speaking
of which just for backup for example
we've got two two terabyte WD blacks and
those are going to be put in a raid 1
array for extra redundancy goodness and
I think finally we've got no no we've
got the case which the case is very very
important because this this is the enthu
primo and from fan ticks of course and
it does support two power supplies so
that's there's really not many cases out
there that do that however you are
probably going to want a case that does
so if you are going to be using a power
combo and there is ample room in here to
mount the power combo as well so I kind
of just made sense if you're going with
kind of a niche product like the power
combo to actually get a case from the
same manufacturer so you know everything
is compatible other than that excellent
case great airflow tons of mounting
options obviously and then finally we've
got this workstation board from AC so
this is the z170 WS and this is just a
beast of a board it's got tons of
connectivity options and while it while
it is really tailored for workstation
applications like rendering and things
like that streaming it is really good
for gaming as well you can see it's got
four PCIe by 16 slots Gen 3 of course
and it does support up to four white sli
or crossfire so it's pretty nice you've
also got 2 m2 PCIe nvme slots that is by
4 and you also have a u2 connector right
here by your SATA ports of course your
USB 3.1 type A and type C connectors on
the
Rayo and just just coated in a beautiful
aesthetic overall so those are all the
parts I know I kind of rushed through it
but I just want to get this thing built
really quickly because I'm super excited
about it and and then I'm going to go
ahead and test this power combo as I
mentioned earlier so why don't we go
ahead and do that now
alright y'all so the build is finally
complete here she is in all of her glory
and here we have her running Unigine
Heaven 4.0 in the background everything
is looking good
vitals thermals everything's checking
out so that's a good sign we have a good
boot so far however if you were paying
close attention to the time lapse you
might have noticed one or two different
snags that I encountered during the
build process the first of which which
happened early on was noticing or
realizing that the CPU cooler I picked
out initially was way too big to
actually clear our RAM here so we're
running into some RAM clearance issues
that was just a huge oversight on my
part so what we ended up doing or what I
ended up doing was downsizing to a
smaller fantex cooler the pea HTC 12 DX
which has two 120 millimeter fans at a
single heatsink tower and that seems to
be working out just fine the second
thing that I overlooked was how freaking
large this case is the enthalpy mo is
just a behemoth of a case and I haven't
built in a full tower for quite some
time so what I overlooked and what I
completely didn't think of is having a
cable that would route all the way from
the power combo which is mounted at the
very front at the bottom of the case to
the eight pin EPS connector on the
motherboard
so what I ended up having to do was
actually take two eight pin extensions
and link them together it's the first
time I've ever really had to do that and
thank God I had two of them on hand
otherwise I don't know what I would I
would have done I probably would've had
to take the the power combo and
physically move it closer to the eight
pin and do some kind of nasty routing
where I had to like run run the cable
over the video card or something like
that so I'm glad I didn't have to do
that it all worked out in the end
however what we're here to discuss is
the power combo so right now we've got
both power supplies that are pooling
their resources essentially to drive the
system now let's see what happens when I
unplug one of the power supplies from
from our rig here it's still scary even
though I know it's going to be fine it's
scared it scares me
ahaha okay so we just unplug the GG 750m
and it's completely normal
nothing nothing's changed it was not
even any like flinching or like
flickering or anything like that I've
even checked gpu-z
and monitored the GPU load and so far
nothing I mean it's still at 99%
plug it and it doesn't even flinch so
that's a really good thing now we can go
ahead and plug this back in and you
shouldn't do this you should power off
the system before you plug a power
supply back in if if you're in this kind
of situation sorry for the ambient noise
go ahead and plug this back in all right
now I'm going to go ahead and unplug the
other power supply now this is the power
supply that is actually the one powering
the the graphics card because the power
combo you're only plugging in your 8 pin
EPS as well as your 24 pin cables from
each from each unit however SATA and
PCIe are connected directly from one of
the power supplies to to your drives and
video card and it doesn't matter you can
you can mix and match here so you could
actually have one power supply powering
your GPU and the other one powering your
drives or vice versa so let's go ahead
and unplug the one that is powering our
video card I believe the drives are
powered on the 750m so I'm going to go
ahead and unplug this and Unigine Heaven
4.0 is still running strong all right
guys so what we've just witnessed is
that you can essentially yank out the AC
cord from either power supply with
little to no effect on your systems
overall performance we didn't see any
kind of CPU or GPU Dru pitch which is
pretty awesome and to validate that
point even further I actually ran some
benchmarks on this system in Unigine
Heaven 4.0 what I found was whether
whether I was just running the system
and not touching it with both power
supply's plugged in or yanking out the
power supply midway through didn't
matter which one the framerate was
consistent across the board so um it's
actually kind of funny I scored three
frames per second on average higher when
I was yanking out the power supplies as
opposed to just letting the system go so
I think I'm just going to start yanking
out the AC cord when I'm in mid-game to
give me a little bit of a performance
boost but that's pretty much it guys and
this shows that the power combo really
does work nifty little gadget here from
fantex so be sure to let me know what
you think of it in the comments below if
you have any use for it yourself or if
you can see yourself utilizing it in a
different way but that's all for now
guys be sure to toss me a like on the
video if you enjoyed it subscribe to the
channel for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon
until next time I'll see y'all in the
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
