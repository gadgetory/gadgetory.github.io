the channel hope you're all doing well
today we're going to be doing some
rising overclocking specifically talking
about the OC experience on the be 350
platform or chipset versus the X 370
chipset because both of them support
overclocking which automatically makes
the chipset purchasing decision a bit
more complicated for the new rising user
than it does the Intel user for example
if you have an Intel KB like unlocked
SKU for example and you're wanting to
overclock then Z 270s your go-to chipset
it's kind of a no-brainer of course you
could go z170 but that's last generation
it doesn't count it doesn't count so if
you're a risin owner
you're probably wondering can I save
some money on a be 350 board without
sacrificing much overclocking Headroom
because be 350 right now is
significantly cheaper than a lot of the
X 370 boards that are currently
available if we put overclocking on hold
for a second just look at the official
differences between be 315 X 370 will
see the main differences are really SATA
and USB 3.1 gen2 port and PCIe bandwidth
X 370 has a bit more a few extra PCIe
lanes that allows it to have native
support for multi-gpu configurations
although a quick side note there are
some be 350 boards out there that have
plx chips included on them which allow
you to crossfire SLI multiple GPUs but
that's for another topic now again both
of these chips that's officially support
rise in overclocking but AMD sort of
just cuts it off right there they don't
specifically confirm whether X 370 is a
better overclocking chipset than be 350
that's sort of a question that's left
into the hands of the manufacturers the
board makers and really the sort of
component tree or the VRMs that they've
embedded onto their main boards now we
already know that X 370 boards are
typically more expensive than their be
350 counterparts and this is likely due
to the additional features that come
with X 370 like the the features that we
just discussed but it's also because of
the fluff features that the board makers
add in there like RGB lighting or audio
emi shields or those steel-reinforced
pci slots that i still don't really see
a point for but for the purpose of this
video let's just assume we care nothing
about any of that crap and we just want
to know which chipset provides the
better overclocking experience for the
end user so in that case in order to
help us answer that question
we've got two boards that were going to
be comparing today the Asus prime X 370
pro against the Asus Prime at be 350
plus RB 350 board retails for an MSRP of
a hundred bucks flat whereas the X 370
board goes for a hundred and sixty
dollars quite a premium if all we care
about again theoretically is
overclocking it's worth noting that both
of these boards support a maximum vdr
frequency of 2666
however since this platform is still
very much in its infancy we've been had
we've been seeing a lot of issues with
motherboards hitting frequencies over 21
33 megahertz for the memory so it'll be
kind of interesting to see if our X 370
board for today has any sort of leverage
in that department over our be 350 model
speaking of memory let's quickly go over
the rest of our testing hardware for
today we've got a 16 gigabyte kit of
g.skill tried NZ ddr4 at 3200 again this
falls outside of the spec of what our
motherboards support in terms of speeds
so we'll be again shooting for 2666
instead our CPU of the hour is none
other than the risin 5 1600 X this is a
6 chord 12 thread part with a 95 watt
TDP and I'm looking forward to
overclocking the crap out of it today
that'll be paired with a Noctua Nhu 12s
gtx 1070 founders Edition running stock
a 512 gig ADATA SX 900 SSD and of course
there HX 750 watt power supply Windows
10 64 bit is our beloved operating
system of choice and rest assured I'm
using a lot of latest wiggled drivers
and BIOS versions it's very important
for both of our motherboards today so on
that note without further ado I'm going
to fire up the be 350 board first let's
change camera gear or camera angles so
you can see what I'm doing on-screen and
we're going to see how far we can take
our 1600 X first on the be 350 chipset
so here we are in the UEFI I'm going to
exit easy mode we want hard mode alright
I'm going to start with changing the
core ratio here we're going to overclock
our core let's do or we already know
that it can hit 4 gigahertz I'm going to
do 4 1c we can do 4.1 gigahertz up sorry
and the CPU voltage okay so they got
this here the CPU voltage here offset
where is the option for
interesting that's already sort of
something to note here is that there
doesn't seem to be a V core option
within the BIOS on this be 350 board it
looks like you can only change via
offset so I guess I guess we'll do that
then
Oh point zero three five maybe okay well
it'll block us into three seven point
zero three seven five so maybe I wonder
if the X 370 board allows you to change
the vcore interesting unless I'm just
not seeing it okay let's just let's just
boot into the OS here and run a quick
stability test
don't you dare windows update on me you
son of a bitch okay good all right let's
go back to Tweaker 42 and let's leave
the offset mode here let's try this
again 4.2 gigahertz can we do it so I
don't know so I haven't tested this
thoroughly with X 370 boards but be 350
boards seem to take a really long time
to boot like up to 30 seconds and I've
actually read this on multiple other
review sites and stuff that have
reported this it's a really long boot
time we're rocking a pretty fast SSD
here with Windows 10 loaded on so I'm
not not sure what's up with that I don't
know if there's something that a BIOS
updates gonna fix eventually but okay
we've been at a black screen now for way
too long so I'm guessing our overclock
did not take so I'm going to go ahead
and reset and tweak some settings move
up the voltage a bit and see if that
works
set up get damned eggs those aren't my
dogs by the way those are my neighbor's
dogs who suck neighbors with
shitty dogs it's not that it's not the
dog's fault it's a shitty neighbors okay
Beck and the BIOS let's try changing our
offset let's go point 0 for 375 see if
that works what we booted into the OS
let's run Ida
is it a tower Ida I have found like a
dirty southern name come here Ida my
cousin's name was Ida my favorite name
that's why I married her alright
starting Oh insta crash insta crash
and burn alright lads this is where I'm
calling it 4.1 gigahertz with an offset
of point zero three seven five volts
going to lock that in as our stable
overclock for the core and let's let's
just mess around with some memories now
mammaries so let's go ahead and do 26 66
which is again highest rated speed that
the our motherboard supports here and
then we'll do C D Ram timing control I
believe the timings here are 14 all
around and 34 and we should change our
voltage as well 1.35 we'll start with
that we'll see let's see if that takes
come on
oh we booted we booted we're booting it
at 20 666 my lord it's America oh my
lord here we go thirteen hundred and
thirty point six megahertz we're going
to multiply that by two this is a dual
channel kit double data rate memory
giving us twenty six 66 megahertz on the
mammaries on the ddr4 so our final score
here for the be 350 platform is 4.1
gigahertz on the core with an offset of
point zero three seven five bolts and a
ddr4 frequency of 20 666 tails yeah all
right I think on that note we can go
ahead and switch over to our X 370
chipset board and see if there is any
difference at all okay so here we are on
the BIOS for our prime x-37b pro
motherboard and the UEFI looks very so
strikingly similar
let's as our B 350 model they're both
Asus boards of course but hey look
there's an actual manual option for the
vcore so you can just dial in the
straight V core just like that instead
of being restricted to only settings and
offset as we stop with the be 350 board
so while this is in no way shape or form
you know increases your overclocking
Headroom it is nice to have these
additional features just little things
like this is really great for
enthusiasts overclockers who will
actually take advantage of them so I'm
going to do the same method though that
we did for for the last board so I'm
going to do still an offset here
Oh point zero three seven five and we're
going to go to four point one C four
point 41 on the ratio and we'll just
dial in our timing stuff here wait
memory frequency 2666 better time
control 14 all the things DRAM voltage
123 501 point 35 and let's see if we can
boot with that yes into Windows we go
so 4.1 gigahertz yes on all cores yes
memory at 1330 yes again 2666 we are on
board all that we're running at the
exact same frequency both on our core
and memory as we were with our be 350
board I've run a quick stability test
here okay stability tests was looking
good so I'm going to go ahead and
restart let's see if we can hit that 4.2
gigahertz mark I think we can no I
really don't I have no confidence that
there will be any difference all right
so we were running stable on that end
let's go ahead and see just see we have
to see if we can hit 4.2 gigahertz maybe
not with this offset let's do point zero
four and see see what happened well just
see what happens now I should mention
that the vrm definitely looks a bit more
robust on the X 370 board than it does
on our be 350 model not that that means
anything in regards to overclocking
Headroom it could have something to do
with the overall quality or the perhaps
the efficiency oh oh Jesus Christmas and
we just crashed okay so at the end of
the day ladies and gentlemen it appears
that both are be 350 and X 370 chipsets
were able to pull off the exact same
settings for our ddr4 and our 1600 X it
looks like there's no discernible
difference when it comes to overclocking
potential between either of these
chipsets
the real main difference here other than
all the fluff features and if you want
to do multi-gpu setups
is the price and there's even more
expensive X 370 boards than the one we
tested today so I would say put that
money towards more important things in
your system you know maybe buy a faster
CPU or a faster graphics card for
example increase your SSD storage
capacity don't waste it on a fancy
motherboard because it looks super nice
and has RGB lighting and things like
that unless of course that's what you're
into but at the end of the day be 350
this really puts a put some minimal
argument for X 370 after this test and
again this is not an end-all and end-all
fact that X 370 does not provide better
overclocking experiences for the
end-user because again I'm only testing
I've only tested these two boards guys
so I want to make that clear I'm not
saying that x3 you know this isn't an
absolute truth by any means this is just
one man's experience with two
motherboards one man two boards you
could say and before this video goes
south real quick I'm going to close out
this video guys so thank you so much for
tuning in let me know what your thoughts
are on the whole be 350 verse X 370
