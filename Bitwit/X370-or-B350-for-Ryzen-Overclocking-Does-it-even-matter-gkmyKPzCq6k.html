the channel hope you're all doing well
today we're gonna be doing some rising
overclocking specifically talking about
the OC experience on the be 350 platform
or chipset versus the X 370 chipset
because both of them support
overclocking which automatically makes
the chipset purchasing decision a bit
more complicated for the new rising user
than it does the Intel user for example
if you have an Intel KB like unlocked
SKU for example and you're wanting to
overclock then z to 70s your go-to
chipset it's kind of a no-brainer of
course you could go z170 but that's last
generation it doesn't count it doesn't
count so if you're a rising owner you're
probably wondering can I save some money
on a be 350 board without sacrificing
much overclocking Headroom because be
350 right now is significantly cheaper
than a lot of the X 370 boards that are
currently available if we put
overclocking on hold for a second and
just look at the official differences
between be 315 X 370 will see the main
differences are really SATA and USB 3.1
gen2 part and PCIe bandwidth X 370 has a
bit more a few extra PCIe lanes that
allows it to have native support for
multi-gpu configurations although a
quick side note there are some be 350
boards out there that have PL X chips
included on them which allow you to
crossfire SLI multiple GPUs but that's
for another topic now again both of
these chipsets officially support rise
in overclocking but AMD sort of just
cuts it off right there they don't
specifically confirm whether X 370 is a
better overclocking chipset than be 350
that's sort of a question that's left
into the hands of the manufacturers the
board makers and really the sort of
component tree or the VRMs that they've
embedded onto their main boards now we
already know that X 370 boards are
typically more expensive than their be
350 counterparts and this is likely due
to the additional features that come
with X 370 like the the features that we
just discussed but it's also because of
the fluff features that the board makers
add in there like RGB lighting or our do
EMI shields or those steel-reinforced
PCI slots that I still don't really see
a point for but for the purpose of this
video let's just assume we care nothing
about any of that crap and we just want
to know which chipset provides the
better overclocking experience for the
end user so in that case in order to
help us answer that
we've got two boards that were gonna be
comparing today the Asus prime X 370 pro
against the Asus Prime at be 350 plus RV
350 board retails for an MSRP of a
hundred bucks flat whereas the X 370
board goes for a hundred and sixty
dollars quite a premium if all we care
about again theoretically is
overclocking it's worth noting that both
of these boards support a maximum PDR
frequency of 20 666 however since this
platform is still very much in its
infancy we've been happy we've been
seeing a lot of issues with motherboards
hitting frequencies over 21 33 megahertz
for the memory so it'll be kind of
interesting to see if our X 370 board
for today has any sort of leverage in
that department over our be 350 model
speaking of memory let's quickly go over
the rest of our testing hardware for
today we've got a 16 gigabyte kit of G
scale Trident z ddr4 at 3200 again this
falls outside of the spec of what our
motherboards support in terms of speeds
so will be again shooting for 2666
instead our CPU of the hour is none
other than the risin 5 1600 X this is a
six core 12 thread part with a 95 watt
TDP and I'm looking forward to
overclocking the crap out of it today
that'll be paired with a Noctua Nhu 12s
gtx 1070 founders Edition running stock
a 512 gig a data SX 900 SSD and a
corsair HX 750 watt power supply Windows
10 64 bit is our beloved operating
system of choice and rest assured I'm
using a little latest wickel drivers and
BIOS versions it's very important for
both of our motherboards today so on
that note without further ado I'm gonna
fire up the be 350 board first let's
change camera gear or camera angles so
you can see what I'm doing on screen and
we're gonna see how far we can take our
1600 X first on the be 350 chipset so
here we are in the UEFI I'm gonna exit
easy mode we want hard mode all right
I'm gonna start with changing the the
core ratio here we're gonna overclock
our core let's do 4 we already know that
it can hit 4 gigahertz I'm gonna do 4 1
see if we can do 4.1 gigahertz sorry and
the CPU voltage okay so they got this
here the CPU voltage here offset where
is the option 4
interestings that's already sort of
something to note here is that there
doesn't seem to be a V core option
within the BIOS on this be 350 board it
looks like you can only change via op
set so I guess I guess we'll do that
then
Oh point zero three five maybe okay well
it'll lock us into three seven point
zero three seven five so maybe I wonder
if the X 370 board allows you to change
the vcore interesting unless I'm just
not seeing it okay let's just let's just
boot into the OS here and run a quick
stability test
don't you dare windows update on me you
son of a bitch okay good all right let's
go back to Tweaker 42 and let's leave
the offset mode here let's try this
again
4.2 gigahertz can we do it so I don't
know so I haven't tested this thoroughly
with X 370 boards but be 350 boards seem
to take a really long time to boot like
up to 30 seconds and I've actually read
this on multiple other review sites and
stuff that have reported this it's a
really long boot time we're rocking a
pretty fast SSD here with Windows 10
loaded on so I'm not I'm not sure what's
up with that I don't know if there's
something that a BIOS updates gonna fix
eventually but okay we've been at a
black screen now for way too long so I'm
guessing our overclock did not take so
I'm gonna go ahead and reset and tweak
some settings move all up the voltage a
bit and see if that works shut up your
damned eggs those aren't my dogs by the
way those are my neighbor's dogs who
suck my shitty neighbors with shitty
dogs it's not that it's not the dog's
fault
this is bits of shitty neighbors okay
Beck and the BIOS let's try change in
your offset let's go point 0 for 375 see
if that works
what we booted into the OS let's run Ida
is it a tower Ida Ida sounds like a
dirty southern name
come here Ida my cousin's name was Ida
my favorite name that's why I married
her alright starting Oh insta crash
insta crash and burn alright lads this
is where I'm calling it 4.1 gigahertz
with an offset of point zero three seven
five volts you luck that in as our
stable overclock for the core and let's
let's just mess around with some
memories now some mammaries so let's go
ahead and do 20 666 which is again the
highest rated speed that our motherboard
supports here and then we'll do let's
see here I'm timing control I believe
the timings here are 14 all around and
34 and we should change our voltage as
well 1.35 well start with that we'll see
let's see if that takes oh we booted we
booted we're booting in at 26 66 my lord
it's America oh my lord here we go
thirteen hundred and thirty point six
megahertz we're gonna multiply that by
two this is a dual channel kits double
data rate memory giving us twenty six 66
megahertz on the mammaries on the ddr4
so our final score here for the be 350
platform is 4.1 gigahertz
on the core with an offset of point zero
three seven five bolts and a ddr4
frequency of 20 666 pills yeah alright I
think on that note we can go ahead and
switch over to our X 370 chipset board
and see if there is any difference at
all
okay so here we are on the BIOS for our
prime X 370 Perot motherboard and the
UEFI looks very so strikingly similar
let's as our be 350 model they're both
Asus boards of course but hey look
there's an actual manual option for the
vcore so you can just dial in the
straight v core just like that instead
of being restricted to only setting an
offset as we saw with the be 350 board
so while this is in no way shape or form
you know it increases your overclocking
Headroom it is nice to have these
additional features just little things
like this is really great for
enthusiasts overclockers who actually
take advantage of them so I'm gonna do
the same method though that we did for
for the last board so I'm gonna do still
an offset here
Oh point zero three seven five and we're
gonna go to four point one see 4.41 on
the ratio and we'll just dial in our
timing stuff here wait memory frequency
28 666 the dirt I'm in control 14 all
the things DRAM voltage one point three
five one point three five and let's see
if we can boot with that yes into
Windows we go
so 4.1 gigahertz yes on all cores yes
memory at thirteen hundred and thirty
yes again 2666 we are on board all that
we're running at the exact same
frequency both on our core and memory as
we were with our be 350 board run a
quick stability test here
okay stability tests was looking good so
I'm gonna go ahead and restart let's see
if we can hit that 4.2 gigahertz mark I
think we can no I really don't I have no
confidence that there will be any
difference alright so we were running
stable on that end let's go ahead and
see just see we have to see if we can
hit 4.2 gigahertz maybe not with this
offset let's do point zero four and see
see what happened we'll just see what
happens now I should mention that the
vrm definitely looks a bit more robust
on the X 370 board than it does on our
be 350 model not that that means
anything in regards to overclocking
headroom it could have something to do
with the overall quality or the perhaps
the efficiency oh oh Jesus Christmas and
we just crashed okay so at the end of
the day ladies and gentlemen it appears
that both RB 350 and X 370 chipsets were
able to pull off the exact same settings
for our ddr4 and our 1600 X it looks
like there's no discernible difference
when it comes to overclocking potential
between either of these chipsets the the
real main difference here other than all
the fluff features and if you want to do
multi-gpu setups
the price and there's even more
expensive X 370 boards than the one we
tested today so I would say put that
money towards more important things in
your system you know maybe buy a faster
CPU or a faster graphics card for
example increase your SSD storage
capacity don't waste it on a fancy
motherboard because it looks super nice
and has RGB lighting and things like
that unless of course that's what you're
into but at the end of the day be 350
this really puts a put some minimal
argument for X 370 after this test and
again this is not an end-all an end-all
fact that X 370 does not provide better
overclocking experiences for the
end-user because again I'm only testing
I've only tested these two boards guys
so I want to make that clear I'm not
saying that x3 you know this isn't an
absolute truth by any means this is just
one man's experience with two
motherboards one man two boards you
could say and before this video goes
south real quick I'm gonna close out
this video guys so thank you so much for
tuning in let me know what your thoughts
are on the whole be 350 verse X 370
