you guys need a legit website for your
tech YouTube channel blog or whatever
the dot tech squad is offering $5.00 dot
tech domains until April 8th with the
code awesomesauce this is a new
initiative so many domain names haven't
been taken yet that's why I was able to
score awesomesauce check before any of
you guys could snag it first and try
selling it to me later
trolls go check it out I put a link in
the description ok bye what's up guys so
while back I was browsing Amazon lakh
adieu and I stumbled across this whole
selection of half mechanical keyboards
that's stupid I thought why would anyone
buy half of a mechanical keyboard upon
realizing the absurdity of my erroneous
inner thoughts I was overcome with shame
and embarrassment but more importantly I
decided to investigate the matter
further by ordering one such half-breed
from Mason from the lowly price of just
42 bucks while the significantly low
price point compared to full mechanical
boards will certainly piqued the
interest of budget gamers let's unlock
the mysteries behind these peculiar
specimens and find out whether they can
satisfy your mechanical keyboard
cravings on the cheap well without
putting too fine a point on it a half
mechanical keyboard is at its core a
membrane keyboard that uses a
combination of rubber domes and faux
mechanical switches which give keys a
tactile and audible feedback to
allegedly induce the feeling of genuine
mechanical switches this discovery is
kind of like that moment when you
realize you're 120 Hertz TV is actually
a 60 Hertz panel using black frame
insertion even if you don't know what
that is doesn't sound very pleasant
doesn't like traditional membrane boards
each key rests above a rubber dome which
when pressed all the way down creates
contact between two conductive layers of
a large plastic membrane in order to
register the keystroke this design is
nothing new in fact rubber domes and
membrane keyboards have a long-running
reputation for feeling mushy lacking
tactility and causing finger fatigue
however the keys on half mechanical
keyboards do feature a tactile bone
there are a couple differences though
because of the rubber dome shape and
movement the tactile bump on the half
mech board is significantly larger and
feels more prominent than the bump on
say a Cherry MX brown switch I got used
to the change within a few minutes of
typing but still prefer the subtler bump
of Cherry MX browns
additionally the rubber match
Uriel of the dome keeps the bump from
feeling quite as tighter snappy as its
mechanical counterpart
not to mention rubber is subject to
changes in its elasticity over time
which can weaken the snappy feeling even
further adding up all these factors
makes the half met keys feel altogether
very different from leading mechanical
switches but there's still light years
ahead of membrane keys that are less
tactile than mashed potatoes another
component that sets half mechanical
keyboards apart is the plastic post and
housing the addition of these two
elements create a straighter linear
motion on keystrokes and provide a dash
of audible tactility like the tactile
bump an audible response helps keep
typhus aware of their keystrokes but few
membrane keyboards make much noise at
all if not for the sound of your fingers
tapping on the plastic keys
unfortunately we can't hear the rubber
domes when bottoming out on a half
mechanical keyboard but we do hear the
satisfying click of the post making
contact with the housing on our way back
up this sounds pretty close to the key
release of mechanical switches but the
lack of any downward noise on the half
mech give these two bored types a very
different sound profile two other
important attributes to consider here
are actuation force and travel distance
I couldn't find exact numbers on the
interwebs
but these Keys pack a pretty hefty
resistance the closest thing I can
compare them to are actually Nova touch
switches a type of mechanical switch
used in the popular 10 Heelys board from
coolermaster public opinion on this
level of actuation force is pretty
polarizing so you'll have to decide for
yourself whether this suits your typing
style travel distance here is notably
shorter than standard mechanical keys by
a good few millimeters this can go one
of two ways as a greater travel distance
gives your fingers a longer range of
motion when typing which is generally
more comfortable at the same time the
membrane design means having to bottom
out the keys in order to activate every
keystroke so a shorter travel might help
alleviate finger fatigue over long
typing sessions without having a second
half keyboard with a long travel
distance it's hard for me to say which I
prefer but that extra bit of plunging I
get on my case evan dr gb is definitely
a more comfortable experience than the
Mazin Mazal must
own the last thing you might want to
consider here is durability and
longevity again the rubber domes are the
weakest link here is they can lose their
elasticity or become overly elastic over
time meaning your actuation force is
subject to change with prolonged use and
can potentially slow down your typing
speed the performance of membrane boards
can also be affected by issues which
mechanical keyboards are simply not
prone to such as dust buildup within the
membrane layers or rubber dome
degradation ultimately this
significantly cuts down a lifespan of
Happy's compared to full mechanicals
which are commonly rated at 10 million
and 50 million keystrokes respectively
moving away from the actual keys for a
moment the Mazal also sports a handful
of features typical of what you'd find
on a mechanical keyboard including a
braided USB cable windows lock key and
backlit LEDs with seven adjustable
colors and brightness it also has two
elevated folded feet and perhaps the
most important of these features a full
metal baseplate the grounded weight of
this metal backing really makes the
product feel like a mechanical keyboard
when typing while also upping its
perceived value to the 60 or $70 price
range the overall build quality of the
housing and key caps feels pretty solid
all around with a sharp minimalistic
design that's sure to make the keyboard
mole game what routing out on a cosmetic
trait that I'm sure you guys already
picked up on the male's own keyboard
does feature a cherry cross shaped stem
so you're free to change out the key
caps to a custom set that'll probably
cost you more than this entire keyboard
on that note guys and gals what lesson
is to be taken away from today's
investigation well I think it's safe to
say that the only way you're going to
get that genuine Cherry MX feel is by
forking out the dough on a cherry MX
keyboard plain and simple
at least for the Mazzone model we tested
today there are a lot of key differences
to the point where anyone remotely
familiar with mechanical keyboards could
distinguish the two pretty easily
however if you drop this on my table and
told me it was using nova touch switches
with a tactile bump included I probably
wouldn't bat an eye the high actuation
force and quiet key press surprisingly
make this an excellent budget
alternative to what are typically very
expensive mechanical switches this also
might be a good stepping stone for those
of you with classic membrane boards who
aren't ready for or simply refuse to
dish out your life savings on a flagship
mech with so many factors to consider
the half mechanical keyboard is truly
hard to define
and thus falls into this strange
category of its own but from what I've
gathered today the Missoula or whatever
the hell it's name is does what it
promises by delivering a far superior
typing experience and feature set to
traditional membrane offerings for a
fraction of what you pay for a premium
mechanical keyboard but let me know what
you guys think about these things in the
comments and don't forget to toast Boyd
if you enjoy
but what did I do that more often I'm
gonna spend on my chair in every video
freaking sweet before you go check the
description for awesome shirts this is a
pulse hardware shirt you should buy one
of these too and feel free to bookmark
my Amazon affiliate link down there and
use it when you busted okay okay yeah
yeah
as always I'm causal move over watches I
promise I'm not drunk I'm not drunk I'm
just weird I'm just weird
hey thank y'all for subscribing that's
nice how it goes subscribe to the
