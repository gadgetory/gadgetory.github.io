Instagram which is stupid I should never
ask the internet anything but I haven't
learned my lesson yet I basically asked
you guys if you'd want to see me cram
Rison 930 900 x12 court 24th read part
into my very lovely Dan case a4 system
here we're gonna we're gonna try to
doing it today right now we have a risin
7 2,700 in here nan XQ 65 watt TDP part
got an asus rog Strix x4 70 i gaming
motherboard mini ITX of course we've got
16 gigs of g.skill ripjaws 5 ddr4 at
3200 speed this I believe is a 500 gig
samsung 970 Evo plus power supplies of
course here at SF 450 yes that's enough
juice to drive the system we have a 92
millimeter liquid Aereo directly from
ASA TAC cooling our Rison chip here and
that's actually fixed with a 92
millimeter slim knock to a fan and on
the other side a big boy or I guess our
little boy a gtx 1080i mini from ZOTAC
it's just such a beautiful system I love
it for the last year or so this has
actually been my on-the-go workstation
system so for like CES earlier this year
we edited with this and it was awesome
it just did a fantastic job stayed cool
in fact I just did a test in Adobe
Premiere Pro rendering out a 10 minute
4k clip with effects and everything this
is running stock and we didn't see
temperatures over 69 C so not even
topping 70 degrees Celsius right now
which is giving me really high hopes
here for our 3900 X even though we are
dealing with significantly more threads
but yeah 105 watt TDP chip compared to
65 watts on the 2700 so yeah I am
expecting this to get quite a bit warmer
by how much I I guess what we're about
to find out I'm hoping that it's not too
hot to the point where the 92 millimeter
Aereo can't handle it and that we have
to actually dumb it down to a measly
Rison 730 700 X this is that the 8 core
16 thread part but this is 65 watt TDP
chess so I think this one will be
definitely manageable but I'm gonna I'm
gonna go for the moonshot first we're
gonna stick the twelve core in first and
then work our way down to the risin 7
part if it just gets too hot so the
first thing though is that we have to
actually update the BIOS because this is
next 470 board which currently is not
running the the latest compatibility by
us with the latest of jasa update and
stuff like that for rising 3000 so I'm
gonna update the BIOS which means we
have to leave this second gen rise and
chip in there for now and we'll go ahead
and swap it out for the 3900
another thing worth noting here is that
AMD's already confirmed that there's not
gonna be a whole lot of manual
overclocking Headroom on anzen - the
reason for that is that they've already
optimized their boosting algorithms
pretty darn well
so precision boost - does a fantastic
job already of maximizing the
performance of the silicon without users
having to get their hands dirty and void
their warranties not that we care much
about that at all anyway on this channel
but it is kind of nice that you're gonna
be seeing a lot more performance
squeezed out of these chips right out of
the box it does kind of suck for
enthusiasts because they don't get to
see as big of gains with manually
tinkering but Amy buddy did say that
there should be a bit more headroom with
their 65 watt TDP parts like the 3700 X
because there's just less power going
through them initially which means that
there's more power to be squeezed out of
them the reason I bring this up is
because if there's not a huge reason to
overclock these chips in the first place
it kind of makes sense to put them into
a system like this where cooling is very
limited and restricts you from
overclocking much anyway so it seems
like a good use case scenario but we'll
see how everything behaves once we've
got those chips in here for now let's go
ahead and get that bios updated so we
can drop in that 12 core I gets hot well
I hope it doesn't get too hot
all right we have our 3900 ex installed
it's sitting pretty idling right now
anywhere in the 40s and 50s which isn't
too bad actually but we'll see how it
holds up under load but let's go ahead
and start this test and see if the
computer explodes starting now oh I'm
also gonna start the timer here underway
and CPU temperatures have spiked up to
around 70 C as you can see it's just
gonna keep climbing as we continue
rendering hopefully it'll stop at some
point for almost at 80 C now we look at
our clock speeds clock speeds are
actually looking really strong 4
gigahertz just there were 4 gigahertz on
all cores
not too shabby their PPI was doing a
nice job of pushing all of our cores
when and where it can fairly
aggressively we're about maybe a quarter
done with our render here doesn't seem
to be any sort of thermal throttling as
far as I can tell CPU utilization is
close to a hundred percent that's really
good and back to our temperatures here a
TC so we're just gonna let this go for a
while we'll let it finish up and then
we'll talk about how the 3900 X did okay
we're about to finish here and it looks
like our max temp is about 94 C I'm
gonna go ahead and stop this okay it
just just done okay six whoa really six
minutes and 49 seconds 2,700 under the
same clip with the same effects in 13
minutes and 29 seconds this did it in
649 that's freakin insane now granted
the trade-off is heat we did get a lot
hotter than our 2700 as well which
didn't really top 70 degrees C here we
could see max temperature of 93 point
nine it wasn't at 93.9 the whole time
it's steadily climbed until it hit that
at the very end
that being said still a bit warmer than
the second gen rising 2700 even with our
92 millimeter AIO I would honestly
suggest at 240 red at minimum for the
3900 X but of course that's not always
an option
in the case this small so you can see
here through the mesh you can see that
ugly not to a fan that's our radiator
fan it's right there so maybe if we just
I don't know I'm just getting ideas
right here just kind of spitballing here
but if we like somehow mounted a fan
and some little mod here where we could
mount the fan like that maybe put a fan
girl over it so you wouldn't make your
fingers or anything that might do some
additional cooling bring the
temperatures down might even increase
performance if we can get those PBO
clocks up so why don't we why don't I
give it a shot right now let's give it a
try
okay I spent all of sixty seconds
setting this up this is just a concept I
have it resting on one of the great
prism RGB cooler the fan actually just a
fan portion and it's not mounted or
secured or anything it's just kind of
sitting there but it's actually hugging
it pretty nicely the cable is
fortunately long enough to reach this
other system right here it's literally
just powered on just so we can power the
fan it was just the quickest and easiest
way to get the fan powered right now I
think we are ready to go again let's go
ahead and reset the status here oh I
want to time it again as well because I
want to see if the render speeds up with
with lower temperatures if we even get
lower times here or so ready set go
start and let the render begin we
actually need to give the CPU a chance
to warm up here all right so now we're
just over halfway done with our render
and it looks like we are getting around
80 to 83 C it's probably still climbing
to some degree unattended I think this
is lower than what the last test was
showing at this point in the encoding
process our clock speeds are looking
good as well still just about 4
gigahertz just under on all course
looking pretty good so far of course
there's always a give and take with
these kinds of things and the take in
this instance is noise my fan is a
little bit noisy because it's on the
outside of the case it's also up against
the side panel that's not intended to
have fans mounted to it so there's a bit
of turbulence there but for the most
part I would gladly take a little bit of
extra noise for these much cooler
temperatures
oh I render is almost about to finish
right hold on ready oh ok 6 do you want
okay so about the same about the same
score same time but you can see our max
temp was 86 point six C much more
favorable than the one 93 degrees on the
last test so I mean just based on these
results alone we're talking potentially
a 10 degree Celsius drop on our CPU just
from doing a little modification with
adding a fan here and this isn't even
optimal I mean this isn't even like
super snug with a side panel that's not
really conducive for fan mounting at all
so what's the modification is done we're
probably gonna see even better
performance than we saw today which is
just super exciting I'm super stoked
that we were able to just drop a 3900 X
in here and have it work beautifully I
mean you wouldn't even think to put a 12
core Intel chip in here unless you had
at least a 240 millimeter a IO
so the fact that we're doing all this
with a single 92 millimeter liquid
cooler is phenomenal I just can't wait
to show you guys the fallout video
should be pretty awesome shooting this
little video is actually getting me
really excited for mini ITX X 570 boards
because once those are ready we can drop
that 3700 X in there and actually have
full native support for PC a Gen 4 which
means we can take some Gen 4 nvme drives
potentially even raise them together and
have a seriously killer editing system
on the go ok for I faint I'm gonna get
out of here guys thank you so much for
watching this video to us all Lloyd got
it before you go get subscribed for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon and
I will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
