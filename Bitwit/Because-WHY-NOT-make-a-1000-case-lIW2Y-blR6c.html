to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info what's
up guys so I actually got a chance to
check out the thermal takes week today
at CES 2018 and they actually had some
pretty cool stuff to show off so I'm
just gonna dive right in for starters
they are pretty much celebrating their
20th year anniversary this year in 2018
so they decided to go all out and pretty
much build a successor to the super
iconic level 10 GT case that launched
nearly a decade ago and they're calling
it the level 20 aptly named since it is
their 20th year anniversary and this
thing is an absolute monster I'm gonna
say it right now this is actually more
expensive than the fantex
and two elite which is what a nine eight
$900 case this is retailing MSRP 999 a
cool grand for this thing but it is
beastly and beautiful it's a beautiful
Beast Beauty and the Beast it was a
movie about this case but somehow it
doesn't matter so just looking at this
case you know it's something special
it's pure tempered glass and full lumen
construction actually it has three
hinged tempered glass doors that swing
open with quick-release latches so
tooless entry for all your components to
access those components and there's
actually three chambers three separate
chambers or ventilated chambers that
house different components like your CPU
and GPU and motherboard are in one your
power supply and you know cable messes
in the other and then you've got your
third chamber for all of your drives but
you could take those drives out all the
drive trays if you wanted to just
install some crazy water cooling
hardware like radiators pump press
combos and so forth so there's a lot of
flexibility with this case there's also
plenty of large rubber grommets between
each of these chambers for routing your
water cooling tubes through so that's
really nice front panel IO includes four
USB three and a single USB 3.1 gen2
type-c port the case includes three of
thermal takes very own 140 millimeter
ring plus RGB fans and two of their
Lumia LED strips
Lumi plus LED strips sorry so a pretty
impressive package overall not cheap but
definitely one of the most beautiful
cases I've
seen in person it looks fantastic the
video just does not do it justice but
that's not all folks Thermaltake was
also showing off their p90 case which is
what they're calling the cornerstone of
case design and I could see why they
might say that because it does look like
it could fit easily in a corner it's
very cubish in shape very simple it's
it's an angled open frame design if you
will it's split into three compartments
kind of like the level 20 but not really
because this is an open-air chassis it
features dual five millimeter thick
tempered glass panels that look
beautiful
three placement options you can stand it
up vertically like you see here in the
video horizontally or you could even
wall mount that sucker as we've seen
with a lot of these types of open-air
chassis from good old Thermaltake it
supports vertical GPU mounting with a
riser cable included not many cases are
including the riser cable this one is
that's nice if you're already decided
that that's the way you're gonna go
which for the record I think vertical
GPU mounting looks fantastic in wall
mounted pcs which you know obviously
this one is so that's nice 480
millimeter radiator support that's
gargantuan pricing here is $179 us for
the black model and 189 dollars a $10
tax for the titanium model which is the
only one they had on display at their
suite moving on here we have the RGB
plus family which is essentially an
entire ecosystem of Thermaltake branded
RGB custom water cooling hardware it's a
bit of a mouthful but they have some
pretty neat things here the Pacific w-4
Plus CPU water block looks fantastic
they have a Pacific v GT X 1080 TI plus
GPU block which is fully transparent so
you can see all the fluid flowing
through it the Pacific P r22 d5 pump res
combo and my personal favorite the
Pacific Plus RGB radiator which is
something I never thought to ask for but
nonetheless I do appreciate it and then
I'll also we have the lui Plus RGB LED
strips of course the nice thing about
all these water cooling products is that
you can actually sync and control them
with thermal takes new sync controller
again so aptly named
this is SATA powered small little device
it's actually fairly thin so it can fit
pretty much anywhere in your case behind
the motherboard tray for example and you
can connect up to nine addressable LED
Thermaltake plus devices to ease
leasing can control via ASIS or a sink
MSI mystic light or RGB fusion from
gigabyte this is also you don't have to
download thermal takes in house ring
plus software is that what it's called
yeah ring plus RGB app which you know
might not have as much time or support
dumped into it as some of these other
motherboard manufacturer apps so it just
makes everything a little bit more
cohesive and easy to use it's available
now for $24.99 us and those are pretty
much all the things that I wanted to
talk about at the Thermaltake suite here
at CES 2018 let me know if anything
