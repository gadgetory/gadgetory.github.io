below geforce
alright i actually came up to this booth
thinking that they would just show me
memory and more memory but they actually
have quite a bit here more than just
memory buffer which is what they're
really known for but i'm gonna start off
small and then we'll work our way up to
the the bigger things for starters we
have this little USB drive that does not
look like a USB drive at all at first
it's actually a multi-tool it's kind of
handy it goes all the way up to 128 gigs
USB 3.1 gen2 been cool to get some Gen 2
speech in there but that's alright we
have a magnifying glass here as well as
a ruler that extends all the way out for
a full length or a longer ruler there's
also a way that you can draw like
perfect circles with it because there's
little little tiny holes in this portion
so if you want to get the perfect circle
on so it's kind of like I don't know I
probably bring this with me to like a
math class or something there's a lot of
applications here but I think this one's
actually a little bit cooler
cuz it's actually got a razor opener or
I should say a box opener this little
part comes off and says we can do a
straight straight blade opening boxes
that comes in very handy on a regular
basis for me anyway a bottle opener that
also comes in handy on for a killer
basis for me there's a built-in magnet
so you know if you need to pick up three
paper clips for a photo shoot it's a
perfect perfect for that and also a
little ruler a little bit smaller than
the last one but it's kind of nice it
also goes connects to your keychain just
fine this one also goes up to 128 gigs
and it's also USB 3.1 gen2 on moving on
here we have the PD 1000 that goes all
the way from 240 gigs to just just under
a terabyte they're getting speeds up to
950 megabits per second or megabytes per
second now these are ip66 rated so it's
going to be shockproof waterproof and
dustproof within those specifications
they've got a nice little demonstration
here that if you hit it straight on with
Thor's hammer it will survive also if it
happens to be in a sand pit of bones the
sand will not corrode and corrupt the
innards of your precious drive and data
kind of a fun demo here I'm gonna
oh no who stole our Drive no I don't
wanna freak them out let's leave it out
and a nice little water water demo here
I kind of want one of these setups at
home just because they'll be relaxing
and offer good good data throughput next
we're looking at the t4s kardia I don't
know if that's how you pronounce it
kardea
I don't know liquid I'm about to PCIe
SSD yes they liquid-cooled m2 SSDs okay
this is this already has the the end on
to drive built-in
unfortunately it's PCIe gen3 so it's not
going to be he won't be able to take
full advantage of pca Gen 4 and X 5 70
but we're gonna circle back to that
later what is cool about these drives
those that you're still getting very
nice nvme performance and a water-cooled
experience there's actually the drives
on the very bottom and then above that
is a thermal pad and I just above that
is a layer of aluminum for thermal
conductivity and then you've got finally
your water block on top of that with a
just a little bit of water water there
now the team proof prep has told me that
they'd actually done some testing here
and found that with liquid involved with
liquid added to the m dot 2 drives we're
seeing a reduction of up to 10 degrees
Celsius under load which is pretty cool
I love to test that myself also over
time this will eventually evaporate the
liquid in here will will start to
disappear and your thermals will just go
back down to a regular regular end up to
thermal pad / heatsink drive but that's
okay you can actually refill it they
thought of that very clearly there's
actually a fill port right here I
believe you push this inward and then
remove the cap here you can actually
drain and refill this entire water block
which is a pretty handy and yes these
colors are the actual coolant themselves
not not not paint or a different part of
the heatsink it's actually the color of
the fluid so I'm curious to see how
they're actually going to sell these and
you can buy them based on you know color
or or it has to be sold separately or
whatever but but be sure to look out for
these the kardia
liquid and the two PCIe SSD next we have
the T force delta max r gb SSD this is a
say the rev 3 6 Giga per second drive
goes all the way from 250 to 2 terabyte
and with this just look at this this is
this is insane this is the largest
amount of illumination that I've ever
seen on an SSD
like by a landslide I think it looks
gorgeous the LEDs are
fairly bright but not too bright and I'm
wondering just I'm very curious to see
if this is going to affect performance
at all as LEDs have been shown to get
extra hot on SSDs and potentially
destroyed them so hopefully that's not
an issue I really hope they did some
testing on that beforehand but if all is
good on that front
these are looking to be some of the most
flashy SSDs on the market apart from you
say the data and in power you do have a
single cable here that's either 5 volts
or 12 volts so if you've got 5 volt you
can obviously adjust the colors to your
heart's content if you decide to go the
12 volt option then you're pretty much
just stuck with a default rainbow RGB
which is usually good enough for most
people this is the T force extreme
addressable RGB ddr4 memory these memory
kits are very reflective so I guess if
you want to bounce some lighting off in
your system or you just kind of like
that very shiny aesthetic these are the
sticks for you potentially now this is
of course with them powered off this is
restful RGB a lot of high end kits have
non addressable RGB it's just a plain
old simple RGB can do quite as much
doesn't look as nice and these kits go
all the way up to 48 hundred megahertz
which is fast it's very fast continuing
with our RGB theme here we have the
world's first 5 volt and 12 volt RGB
controller from T force or from Team
Group this is the T Force Captain RGB
control box and they're actually
supporting up to five Bible connections
and one 12-volt connection so regardless
of the type of RGB devices you're trying
to connect this is kind of one box that
does it all kind of has a nice COO cool
really that's a button RGB button that
can do different lighting modes look at
that they've got two SSDs currently
connected and an RGB fan very very nice
shiny now we do have PCIe exam 4 nvme
SSDs right here these are the z4 40s and
I'm sure about the blue PCBs I hope they
decide to go with the black black
variant at some point but these are
going to deliver
significantly more performance
potentially than PCIe gen3 this is gonna
be great for X 570 boards on the
upcoming AMD platform we also have the T
force Vulcan SSDs these go all the way
up to 2 terabytes and this is just sort
of like a no-frills Drive I think they
really looked a lot classier than a lot
of the aggressive RGB designs out there
so if you just want something with a
little bit more sleek sexy vibe this is
this could be a good drive for your next
ability there's also some external
accessories here for your ps4 they have
this slim RGB Drive let's say the RGB or
TT 4 spark RGB ufd this is actually
pretty cool it's it's so slim that you
can fit it inside of a ps4 whereas most
traditional USB sticks cannot and it's
it's RGB because why would you want RGB
on your USB stick however it's a bit
more functional than that it'll actually
start changing color if the the drive is
actually in use letting you know don't
don't pull it out additionally it'll
start flashing blue if it's I believe
over 80% capacity full which is actually
very handy and then that color will
change as you scale up to higher amounts
of capacity fullness words words are not
coming out right now
so eventually will start flashing red
for example once you hit you know 90 95
percent full of course that's only gonna
be flashing when you're actually doing
data transfer it's not going to be doing
that constantly if if your drives just
sitting there idling that would be that
would be a little bit a little bit
annoying so they actually thought that
through this goes up to 128 gigabytes
and it is supporting USB 3.1 gen2 have
the t4s treasurer external RGB SSD yes
because we need RGB on everything and
this is also USB 3.1 gen2 on has a very
nice RGB strip on the sides there and
the button that you see just to the
right of the actual connector is to
change modes you can do up to five
different color modes has a very nice
sleek sort of brushed aluminum exterior
and you can see it's Type C as well
finally we have the t force excalibur
RGB ddr4 kits these are actually nothing
new
however they have just revamped them
slightly by giving them a nice mirrored
aesthetic so if you again if you're into
that reflective design and want some
things bouncing off of your components
then
there you go there's also a bonus
feature that if you get really bored you
can just play this little maze that's
printed right onto the heat spreader no
that's that's not a real feature online
and really quick guys before I head out
feel free to check out team groups
giveaway that they have going on right
now the link is in the description below
grand prizes include a team force per
day a liquid and two PCIe SSD 250 gig
model this is one of the ones that we
just checked out they're also giving
away a team force t1 ddr4 2666 16
gigabyte kit and finally a t4 vulcan z
ddr4 2666 16 gigabyte kit as well go
ahead check it out guys thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
