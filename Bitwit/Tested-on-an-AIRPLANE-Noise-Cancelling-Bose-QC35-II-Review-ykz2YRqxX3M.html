premium sound for all-around listening

before the drop ends what's going on
guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well today I am clearly
not in my traditional studio setting
because I'm actually out of state
visiting family for the week which means
part of this video is brought to you by
beautiful Chesapeake Virginia now of
course that's not what this video is
about but rather the journey that I took
to get here because before I hopped on
my five-hour flight I ended up picking
up a set of these these are the Bose
QuietComfort 35 series - the hot
long-awaited successor to the series
ones which were critically acclaimed for
having amazing active noise cancellation
supreme comfort and pretty decent sound
actually for a wireless bluetooth
headset it does have a built-in mic so I
guess that makes it a headset um we're
gonna be talking about this and sort of
my experience with it what I've found to
be good and not so good about this new
headset from Bose for starters these
launched with an MSRP of 350 dollars and
that's of course the same price that the
series one was when it first launched
years ago the overall design language on
these cans is pretty nice I mean it's
super simple but somehow manages to not
be boring and they look really nice when
you're wearing them and stuff there
they're definitely stylish but also
understated so they're not going to be
overly aggressive and attract too much
attention which I actually like
additionally we've got sort of a plastic
housing all around which surprisingly is
sturdy for how light it is and I will
say the exception is with the adjustable
headband you actually get some metallic
construction here so no matter how many
times you do this it's probably gonna
hold up fairly well over time you also
get an Alcantara headband on the the
inlay here which is fantastically
comfortable actually everything about
this headset makes it supremely
comfortable for long periods of
listening that's that's including the
very soft of the touch ear pads I
wouldn't call the memory foam but
they're incredibly soft they're kind of
like having pillows on your ears and
additionally you've got just a perfect
clamping force for my sized head anyway
I kind of have an average-sized head I
feel like the clamping force is spot-on
the only thing I will say is that when
you're actually not used
your headphones and your your turn
turning the ear cups out like that
they're a little bit tight around my
neck in particular unless I completely
extend the headband so bear that in mind
if you're kind of person who just likes
to have them relaxed they're not the
most comfortable in that regard but
everywhere else absolutely great I also
appreciate how flexible these ear cups
are you can pivot them in nearly any
direction and that helps them just sort
of go with the flow as you move your
head left and right additionally you can
fold up the entire head set to a pretty
small size it comes included with a very
compact travel case on the right ear cup
you get a power switch that also acts as
a bluetooth pairing switch and pairing
this guy is super quick and easy I had
no issues whatsoever connecting it to my
pixel one and additionally at the bottom
we've got a micro USB charging port it
does come included with a charging cable
as well charging time takes about two
and a half hours but you get twenty
hours of playback time and that's with
the active noise-cancelling enabled Bose
also claims that with just a fifteen
minute charge you get two and a half
hours of playtime which is great if
you're in a pinch next to the micro USB
port we've got a battery life LED
indicator which will flash orange as
your charging and will turn solid green
to let you know that it's at 100% next
to that is a Bluetooth led it's a
pairing pairing led of course and that's
right next to a trio of buttons the ones
on the outside are your volume up and
down and they're slightly raised a
little bit higher than the multifunction
button in the middle which is you know
gonna be for like play and pause for
music tracks movies etc and the fact
that it's a bit recessed makes it really
easy to locate any of these buttons
while you're wearing the headset which
of course means you wouldn't be able to
see them so good on Bose for making
these really easy to locate by touch on
the left ear cup we get a large action
button which summons Google assistant
which is pretty cool so if you're a user
of Google assistant then you can
basically access it tell it to do things
for you without ever looking at your
phone that includes things like you know
telling me what time it is what's the
weather like right now set a reminder
for this call mom and the list goes on
and I'll be honest I use Google
assistant all the time on my phone but I
can't personally see myself using it
much while wearing a headset like this
and listening to music or something like
that some people might be different so I
think at the end of the day this is
gonna be one of those features that you
either
really need and are gonna use all the
time or something that you can honestly
live without now if you don't have a
need for Google assistant you can
actually reprogram the action button to
adjust the level of active noise
cancellation I think you have to
download the Bose Connect app in order
to do that but once you do pressing the
button once will adjust it from either
off to low or high noise cancellation at
high noise cancellation I can't I can
hear probably ten percent of the engine
noise on the airplane it's it's actually
really good and it still retains its
title in my opinion as being one of the
best active noise cancellation
headphones over ear headphones I should
say on the market finally on the bottom
of the left ear cup you get an auxilary
port meaning yes you can use these as
wired headphones which would basically
save you a ton of battery life I think
you go from twenty to forty hours of
playback time and they do include a I
think this is a mini jack to a 3.5
millimeter cable for you to use now when
using this as a wired device you have
the option to keep the headphones on or
power them off if you power them off
you're actually entering passive mode
which means you're disabling boses own
DSP or digital signal processing which
basically equates to not the best sound
you actually have a slight reduction in
just the amount of balance and crispness
of the sound quality and this is
something that I've noticed personally
and have also noted in other reviews at
the end of the day you're gonna get the
best quality sound out of these cans by
keeping them powered on now as far as
the actual sound quality goes I think
these things sound great honestly for
$350 Bluetooth headphones
I mean bear in mind these are Wireless
guys so you're not gonna be hitting
anywhere near audiophile territory but
for the average user these are gonna
sound fantastic as is the case with a
lot of Bose products these are fairly
bass heavy but don't get me wrong they
still have some pretty crisp sounding
mids and highs as well I feel like those
have been tweaked a little bit overall
giving you a pretty balanced sound
signature that again to the average Joe
is gonna sound great so summing things
up here
guys I've only spent about 24 hours with
these things so far but I'm already in
love with them they are by far my
favorite headphones to travel with
especially if I'm flying mainly because
of the active noise cancellation and
yeah they're and they're extremely
comfortable I'd love to actually test
this out in a gaming Senay
to see if this would even make a decent
gaming headset if you guys think that'd
be a cool idea
leave me some love and some feedback in
the comments below
additionally if you already own a series
one headset then I wouldn't say that
this is worth upgrading unless you
really need that Google assistant
however being able to change the active
noise cancellation on-the-fly is super
handy but if you don't have either
headset and this is definitely worth the
10 or 20 dollar premium over the last
generation but guys that's gonna do it
for now thank you so much for watching
this video the birds are getting mad at
me now for taking over their spot but
hey toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it it helps a lot and feel free
to subscribe to the channel for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon
have a good one guys
