brought to you by fantex berta gear
enter max be quiet and cable mod you can
learn more about their products and the
links below what's going on guys kal
with big wood here we are back here at
Computex 2018 covering the birding here
suite and they actually have the same
chair they were showing off at CES
earlier this year with the RGB LED kit
as an upgrade they're selling this
separately it's gonna be compatible with
their PL 4500 chairs but it's it's not
gonna be coming with that chair because
not everybody wants RGB or needs RGB in
their life let's be honest but for those
of you do that options available to you
with either of these upgrade kits
there's one for the the upper backrest
these two really nice pieces that come
into these incredibly nice packaging
boxes you can see there's even acrylic
inserts with the verdict here logos and
you can sort of I guess you don't have
to use those it's completely optional
the battery solution is actually these
18 650 VAP batteries a lot of people who
are in the vapor nation are using these
batteries as well it's kind of
impossible to get out of there right now
but you get the idea it's actually
really cool a very high quality it seems
fairly sturdy let me take this guy out
so you can get a better look at it and
also a closer look at the the battery
module so four of these vape batteries
will go in here into this removable
piece which is looks like to be tool its
removal power button right there looks
like a battery life indicator just below
it and there's a magnet actually which
you can actually plug in for for
charging I believe they were saying over
over 30 hours of battery life for the
upper part and then over 24 hours of
battery life for the base let's take a
look at the base because the base
lighting is just as intriguing and
here's the sort of base package here
which you can actually connect with just
a few screws everything is very easy to
install they're showing me just how
simple it is looks like there's like two
screws per leg here with just these
really nice long RGB bars and this is
gonna be supported by the cam software
NZXT scam software so it's gonna pop up
just like any one of your other
compatible cam supported devices so it's
very easy to customize and configure and
sync with all of your various components
and
and things like that the other cool
thing that they were showing off here
that they didn't have at CES was the
ability to sort of sync up profiles to
particular games particularly with like
eSports titles like csgo which is what
they have on demo here so as you're
doing different functions or behaviors
in the game the LEDs are responding
real-time for example if you're taking
damage your LEDs go from green to orange
to yellow to red or in some some order
like that or if you happen to get hit by
a smoke grenade then all of a sudden
everything turns grey on the LEDs I
don't know if greys of color that an LED
can produce anyway you get the idea it's
actually a really cool effect when put
into practice and I really see this
being very valuable to a lot of
streamers who kind of want to give their
viewers maybe a different kind of
experience when watching them as the
viewers can be very easily tell sort of
what's happening in game to particular
character is just based on the LED
indicators I mean we already sort of
have this feature for individuals in
their home when they're gaming by
themselves and now it's sort of catering
that same concept to a mass audience so
you guys let me know what you think of
this thing it's pretty cool it's gonna
be expensive though the chair alone I
think is about three ninety-nine and
then each of these kids are gonna be 399
as well so I'm sorry 299 299 for each of
the kits for an iron for the chair we're
talking about a thousand-dollar chair
there abouts so you guys let me know if
it's worth it in the comments below what
you think of this whole concept but I'm
gonna get out of here thank you guys so
much for watching be sure to toss like
on the video if you enjoyed it and get
subscribed to you don't miss any more my
coverage here at Computex 2018
I'll see you guys in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
