Squarespace the quick and easy way to
build a kick-ass website what's up guys
welcome back to the channel today I'm
taking a look at the contents of this
enormous box this is the noble chairs
epic series real leather in black it's a
gaming chair in case you couldn't tell
and I'm really not an expert when it
comes to gaming chairs I'm still sort of
conflicted about the whole thing I do
use one I have a Max Nam ik which I did
review back on the channel a few maybe a
year ago but honestly I love that chair
it's been fantastic but it's really the
only basis of comparison I have for
reviewing this chair so I'm going to be
making a lot of those comparisons today
between those two model these two models
this is supposed to be a better chair
according to the manufacturer than
something like the Max anomic because it
features real genuine leather it's all
sexy and stuff but I'm going to go ahead
and test it out just to see what all the
features entail and then we're gonna go
a circle back and do a little conclusion
to see exactly if this thing is worth
the five or six hundred dollars that you
might spend on it so on that note I'm
going to crack this box over we're going
to put it together and check this baby
out
all right here she is in all her glory
or maybe it's a he I'm not sure but
installation was super smooth and easy
probably took me 2530 minutes max to get
this thing all set up instructions over
there we're super clear there's a really
nice big pictures very descriptive and
everything went really smoothly on the
installation front didn't really run
into any issues this thing was up and
running in no time so that's good you
can see I've got my max anomic here my
daily driver just gonna put it right
here for comparison we'll be doing a
little left and righty
occasionally throughout the rest of this
review so I think the best way to do
this right now is to start from the
bottom we'll start from the bottom and
then we'll go to the top and we'll work
our way to all the other things that are
going on up there I'm just going to sit
on the floor right now hope that's cool
with you guys so the first thing I want
to point out is the base here it's full
aluminum and it's kind of got a nice
matte black powder-coated finish and it
seems very sturdy build quality is
top-notch here it does have five it's a
five star design so you've got casters
on the bottom of each of those wings and
the casters are really really actually
nice they they slide very easily whether
you're on hardwood floor and I did test
it out on the carpet as well slides very
easily pretty much on par with the max
notic sorry it's all like dirty and
dusty ape I should have seen that before
the video but you can see this has got
more of a glossy finish on the five star
base and I believe I can't remember if
this is aluminum or metal it's one or
the other but honestly they're pretty
much on par they do look a bit different
because of the gloss versus the powder
coat I actually do like the powder coat
a bit more I think it looks just looks a
little bit more subdued
I don't like gloss on pretty much
anything and and yeah so just right up
here you can see we've got two of these
black levers alright
there's one here and there's one here so
this one I believe adjusts the rocking
mechanism so if you enable that you can
actually rock the chair back and forth
like a rocking chair
and you can also adjust the tension of
that with this knob as well you can
adjust the rocking tension whether you
want it to Teeter very easily or have a
bit more resistance to it and also if
you don't like the rocking the rocking
mechanism you can actually lock it into
place if that's what you're into so
that's nice and then over here you've
got this one for height I believe it's
already maxed out on the height but you
can adjust the seat up or down however
you like obviously I will have mine in
the lowest position because I'm short
you guys know that already and also
we've got a little bit of an incline
here this is a lever that we've got for
the the backrest itself it's kind of
like it works just like the the little
arm seat or the backrest lever in a car
for example and this is also all so far
all the features that I've just talked
about in terms of like scene
adjustability are also found on the
Mac's anomic including this lever here
the lever is full metal it's got a
plastic grip on it for so it's not going
to like you know cut your hand or
anything like that it is very sturdy and
I would say build quality all around is
pretty solid and then you've got the arm
rests these are what they're calling 4 D
or four-dimensional arm rests and
they're pretty much exactly the same as
the ones on the mexican ama clay are
indistinguishable of each other but
that's not a bad thing because I really
I really do like these 4 D arm rests so
what you can do is they've got there's
levers everywhere so you can adjust up
and down like that you've got this
button here that adjusts how far forward
or far back you'd like your armrests
to be which is nice and you've got
another button here that adjusts inward
or outward positioning so depending on
how wide your shoulders are apart and
stuff like that you'll be comfortable
and also the last one is that you can
actually rotate these things just by
turning them see he can rotate it inward
so if you tend to bow out your elbows or
maybe like that maybe that's how you
gain who knows or you can just go
straight of course so a lot of options
with the arm rests moving on to the seat
and the backrest itself in terms of
quality we'll go over the build quality
first super high quality I mean this
thing is for
much as good as it gets one of the best
that I've seen actually I've only really
only ever seen this one but the other
stitching job for one here is just super
good it's just a it's really clean
there's no frame of any kind and it's
just it's the same type of quality
throughout the entire chair it looks
phenomenal and you can see there's even
some some diamond stitching which not
only looks good but I guess it provides
a bit of a bit of a it's a bit more
breathable speaking of breathability
underneath all of this leather inside
the the seat itself as well as the
backrest you'll find some open cell cold
foam which is again very breathable so
it stays more or less cool doesn't
actually warm you up too much especially
in like high summer periods also it's
got a nice firmness to it and it's it's
a bit more firm than the max anomic but
that's also because I've been sitting in
this chair for almost 12 months now so
it has softened up I've definitely
broken it in as I do sit in it every
single day for long periods of time so I
would imagine that this this would
soften it up a little bit as well it's a
bit firm for my liking but again I think
after breaking it in it would be just
perfect for from ash from a sweet cheeks
now of course let's not ignore the
genuine leather material that's being
used on the backrest as well as on the
seat itself because this is one of the
biggest features that noble chairs is
priding themselves with the their epic
series lineup and what's what's the
difference between imitation leather and
genuine leather when it comes to a
gaming chair well I'm glad you asked
first thing is what I would say is like
look and feel right you can kind of tell
actually if you look from side to side
at the max Nama Kover there and the epic
series that I don't know it just looks a
little bit more cheap on the maximum
it's a bit more glossy maybe that's my
back sweat dude but you definitely can't
tell especially when you feel the
leather with your with your with your
soft caress however my back and my butt
can't really tell the difference when
sitting in the chair itself so the
genuine leather I will say does not make
the chair any more comfortable that's
more so dependent on the back and butt
support as well like the cold the
open-cell cold foam and stuff like that
however there are certain other benefits
to genuine leather other than the look
and feel which include durability so for
one it's more resistant to UV stuff UV
as well as moisture so if you guys tend
to sweat a lot during like long gaming
sessions or whatever other sessions you
might be engaged in then perhaps genuine
leather is the way to go over the
imitation stuff now to be fair to really
test out the durability between these
two types of leather I would have to sit
in each one an equal amount of time for
a prolonged period of time not just a
few hours but several months perhaps to
see how they each hold up and
fortunately I've only ever said in the
max anomic for that period of time and I
will say in its defense it's held up
quite nicely even though it does have
imitation leather there's really very
minimal signs of wear and tear if if any
at all I mean other than maybe getting
stretched a little bit here you you
there is a bit of stuff here do you see
those little little markings that's not
actually wear and tear those are my
theme cats I hate those little girls but
truth be told the pleather here on the
max anomic has actually held up pretty
well and I'm super happy with it so it
would be interesting to sit in the epic
series chair for a year or so and do a
bit of a comparison but maybe maybe I'll
circle back in a year from now who knows
now perhaps the biggest question that we
need to answer today in this sort of
comparison review is which one of these
chairs is more comfortable to sit in and
that that's actually important because
even if you have a ton of features like
both of these chairs do if the chair is
not comfortable for any period of time
then it's kind of like all those other
features don't really matter do they do
they so if I would have to give my
honest opinion here and wifey sauce
actually agrees with me on this is that
the max notic in both of our opinions is
the more comfortable chair not so much
for the but I mean the but on both of
these is quite comfortable granted the
max comics a bit more broken in but the
problem with the epic series chair lies
in the back support I think because if
you look at this it's pretty flat so
unless you have a really flat back
that's not going to work out for you I
actually have a pretty sizable arch in
my back so I need good lumbar support
and the great thing about the Max Nam ik
you can already see it's like bulging
out a bit it's got this knob I don't
know if you guys remember this knob from
my review on this chair but it's a justa
belong bar support so if you turn it
you can start to see it bulging out a
little bit it's very subtle might be
hard to see on camera but it actually
bulges out you know and forms to your
back and you can crank it however you
want it's completely adjustable there's
no option there's no such option for
like that on the epic series chair which
is kind of a disappointment instead to
remedy that the loss of any adjustable
back support they have included this
pillow that's your that's your lower
lumbar support which I don't know for a
five or six hundred dollar chair I would
expect a little bit more here and the
problem with this pillow is that unless
your back is exactly the dimensions with
the same arch and stuff it's not going
to feel right and when I when I had
whyphy saw sit in this chair for the
first time she said you know what I
thought she would it's too flat the back
is too flat so I tried having her sit in
it again with the pillow and then she
said well it's too poufy now and it was
actually sticking out so far for her
that her upper back wasn't able to touch
the backrest properly so it's just you
know it needs to be a bit more
adjustable than that the head pillow is
great though Gigi for a critique here
probably the biggest critique out of
this whole review is noble chairs if
you're listening keep everything else
the same
this chair is freaking awesome the build
quality is top-notch
it really is a top-class chair the one
thing I would add is adjustable lower
lumbar support and that is the biggest
difference between the max NAM ik and
the epic series here today and I would
say it's it's pretty damn important but
yeah let me know what you guys think
about it I'm very cute to hear your
thoughts and I really do need a
cameraman let me know what you think of
the chair and what you think about
genuine leather is that's something that
you look for when shopping for a gaming
chair or does it really not matter to
you much I'm very curious to know also I
