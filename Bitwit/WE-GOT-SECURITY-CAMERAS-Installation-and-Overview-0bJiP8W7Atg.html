think it can be a game changer like it
50 bucks Kyle focus isn't AMD rising
just the best Kyle focus oh yeah hold on
let me fix that here we go
dammit over here sexy Kyle focus got it
that's okay I'll just
Netflix while you guys chill the Focus G
from Franklin design is a new budget
case done right click the link in the
description for more info what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing a well so today I'm
taking a look at and actually installing
this security camera kit from the folks
over at on what onw OTE I have no idea
if I'm pronouncing that correctly this
is a Chinese company as indicated by the
verbage in the user's manual but this is
actually a personal purchase for the new
office because we have a lot of
expensive stuff in here computer parts
tons of hardware camera equipment that
needs to be protected and for my own
peace of mind I decided that it was time
to install a security camera system so
we went with this one it's a local
locally capturing system instead of
storing it out off to the cloud or
something like that where you have like
a monthly subscription sometimes I was
kind of sketched out by that idea I kind
of liked all the stuff that's being
recorded saved locally on a hard drive
for example and that's exactly what we
have here we're gonna be explaining a
lot of the other features that come
along with this kit as well I picked
this up off of Amazon for about 300
bucks and I think one of you guys
recommended it to me so thank you to
whoever that was but this is just the
retail packaging why don't we go ahead
and talk about everything that comes
included with this set so for starters
we have an HD NVR kit NVR stands for
network video recorder this unit
actually comes included with the two
terabyte hard drive so we don't even
need to
get open and on the back we've got some
antennas that are adjustable and a
couple I oh here you've got your VGA and
HDMI out so you can take your pick you
will need to hook this up to a moderate
to be able to see what your cameras are
seeing unless you're using like your
mobile app or something like that and
we'll go over that in just a bit you've
got a web port for connecting this unit
to your router a USB port for mouse
functionality and your DC power now
that's pretty much it it's a very simple
little box with a couple other
accessories here we've got an Ethernet
cable which is pretty short this is
again to connect your NVR unit to your
router the dink iasts little mouse that
i've ever seen it probably weighs 2
grams it has left and right click and a
scroll wheel the scroll wheel actually
does have a click itself but it's a you
know whatever at least they include it I
guess for people who don't have a better
Mouse lying around now this unit
actually comes with 4 cameras and it's
an 8 channel kit which means you could
expand it up to 8 cameras if you wanted
to since I only have three office rooms
at this new studio I only need three
cameras so actually I've left one of
them in the box but rest assured it does
come included with four here's a look at
the camera itself it's white and with
some black trim around the the front
there it's it's pretty quite stylish and
it looks like it'll blend in quite
nicely with with our walls as they are
also white these cameras I believe the
resolution is 960 P so it's not full
1080 P but should be enough for our use
I'll be showing you guys some actual
footage later on so you can get a look
at the quality that these guys are able
to pump out night vision is also
supported so up to 80 feet of night
vision which is pretty cool I don't
think any of our rooms are nearly that
long or wide or whatever so that should
be totally fine
it also comes included with wireless
antennas for the cameras you just screw
it in to the back of each one and this
is basically going to allow you to
connect the cameras to the NVR unit
wirelessly so you don't actually need to
route any cables from the cameras to the
NVR unit which is great you still do
need power though each of the cameras
has its own power source
all of these AC adapters so we will have
to find a way later on to kind of mask
those and keep it from looking
absolutely horrendous but for the most
part half of the cables that are
typically found with traditional
security camera kits are
removed so that's kind of nice you also
get a bunch of mounting accessories for
mounting the cameras to either the wall
or the ceiling we actually don't have a
real ceiling we have a drop ceiling here
at this office so we're gonna have to be
mounting them to the walls but more on
that later
and finally you get a user's manual
which hopefully does not suck because
this is my first time ever installing a
security camera system in any shape or
form
so hopefully this all goes smoothly on
that note we can go ahead and start
connecting things I think before we
start drilling holes in walls and
mounting these suckers we should
probably do some sort of a test boot
just to make sure that none of these are
defective because that would really suck
if we were already set up and and then
we ran into those issues so let's go
ahead and get things connected all right
folks
test boot complete and a huge success
might I add the setup initially only
took me about five minutes which is
pretty good obviously we haven't mounted
the cameras or anything that would take
a little bit longer but just to get
everything connected and to get the the
camera feeds actually showing up on the
monitor here about five minutes in total
very quick and straightforward process
like I said earlier basically just
connect the envier the NVR nvme NVR
units to the router which we've done
with the included ethernet cable and
then we've got our peripheral so a my
onyx mouse is actually my mouse because
the included one sucks and the monitor
over here it doesn't actually fill up
the entire screen but that's totally
fine you can still see everything pretty
clearly in fact the image quality is
better than I expected
maybe it's because it's shrunk down a
little bit but it looks pretty clear all
things considered very nice quality very
pleased so far and we've got our three
cameras here tethered only by the their
AC power cords and nothing else and the
best part about this setup though was
that it has this automatic pairing
feature so as soon as you plug in things
as soon as you just power everything up
and connect the peripherals and stuff it
automatically syncs up and and shows you
the the camera feed you don't have to do
any sort of other syncing it's
completely on-the-fly and automatic and
it's awesome so I think at this point we
are ready to start mounting these guys
to their permanent locations and then
figure out some way to conceal these
these black wires the AC power cables I
don't know if we're gonna be able to do
that by the end of this video we might
have to Matt have to order some like
cable channels or whatever from
Amazon and wait for those to come in but
at the very least we can get these set
up get it all functional and working and
show you guys some of the cool features
that come along with this kit because
there are many so let's do that now
cocaine's a health drill
alright guys installation is complete
all three cameras were installed
successfully and it seems to be working
just fine we've got visuals on all three
of our little Suites here the the
storage room which is currently black
and white because there's not much light
going on here so that's sort of the
night vision taking over and we've got
our main office you can see whyphy sauce
on camera right now and part of me and
the screen that we're looking at and
then of course the the works the
workshop area the workshop room over
there which is completely empty right
now but everything's looking really good
and I wanted to kind of talk about some
of the main features of this kit and
what it offers many of which you guys
will probably find useful if you're in
the market for a security camera system
yourself first off we've got night
vision night vision works superbly at
least in our little storage unit here
granted it's a smaller room but
according to the manual and all the
specs and stuff you can get pretty much
up to 80 feet of visibility in the dark
now we haven't tested that ourselves but
from what I can tell in our smaller
storage room it works really well you
can pretty much make out the the facial
features of whoever's in there obviously
a lot of people are going to be using
these security cameras at night or in
darker places so it's nice to know that
you're covered in that area additionally
we've got a live view so you can
actually watch a live feed of these
cameras pretty much anytime anywhere in
the world as long as you connect the NVR
unit to your router that's one thing
that I forgot to mention earlier is that
you don't have to connect the NVR to
your router unless you want to do Live
View and things like that so a live view
right now is is it synced up to my phone
right now through the mobile app it's
working beautifully there's very little
latency not that it matters too much in
this sort of situation but I can pretty
much tap on any of the channels and
watch it in full screen switch between
them very easily it's pretty seamless
it's a really nice experience the UI on
the app is pretty solid as well and I do
appreciate the versatility and the fact
that you can also watch a live stream
via your PC so if you wanted to you can
fire up internet explorer I know it's
not our favorite web browser by any
means but it is the only one supported I
believe according to the manual so it's
nice to know that you can watch your
feeds live on a PC as well it's also
worth noting that apart from live view
you can also go back in time and do some
video playback on either your PC or
your mobile device which is pretty sweet
now there is a feature in here that I'm
still a little unclear on which is the
USB video backup so if you want to
backup some footage that was previously
recorded onto a USB flash drive you can
do that according to the manual by
sticking in a drive into the the only
USB port on the NVR unit which is
confusing because then how do you use
the mouse I'm sort of at a loss right
now I have to do some more investigating
but it seems like you do need a mouse in
order to select the files that you want
to backup on to the flash drive but you
only have one USB port so I'm a little
unclear on that hopefully I can figure
out some answers for you guys and drop
them in the comments should they arise
on top of that I'd say the most
important or the most valuable feature
that I found at least for me personally
is the ability to send yourself alarms
in a various number of ways
whenever motion is detected so on video
detection you can see here you can
select whichever channel that you want
to apply these settings to you can
actually detect more than just motion
there's alarm input if you have a
connected alarm which I don't know too
much about or video loss let's say you
lose signal for whatever reason or the
power goes out you can also receive an
alarm for that as well there's
sensitivity options so anywhere from
lowest to highest let's say you have
security cameras outside of your front
door and you don't want every little
leaf blowing in the wind to set off an
alarm then you can set it on a lower
sensitivity that way
there's also alarm duration and and the
way that you receive alarms there's the
alarm itself again if you connect your
own alarm a buzzer
apparently the NVR unit itself can emit
a buzz whenever this alarm is triggered
which is not too useful especially if
you're if you're wanting to get these
notifications while you're away but
there is the option to receive email
notifications with an attached screen
shot of whatever the cameras picked up
at that time so if there's a perpetrator
that walks into your office or your home
you'll actually get an email
notification with a picture of them
attached to it which is super cool and
finally you can receive notifications or
alarms through your smart phone or
mobile device through the through the
mobile app arming time is pretty
self-explanatory you can pretty much
just set your own schedule for when
these alarms are sent out and when when
you get notifications and finally we've
got area
edit this is actually pretty cool let's
say you have a security camera out on
your porch and there's an American flag
waving in the air at all times you don't
want to get triggered haha
every time the flag is waving so you can
actually block out that area so so the
software knows to ignore that particular
space and you won't get hit up every
five seconds for a stupid flag waving in
the air all of these features make up a
pretty robust solution for keeping tabs
on your valuables on your property and
just overall peace of mind that I think
I'm gonna really enjoy a lot so that's
pretty much all I have to say for now
