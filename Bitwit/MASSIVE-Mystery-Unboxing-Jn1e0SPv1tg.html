which can be shown up vertically
horizontally or even on your wall to
learn more click the link in the
description for more info what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well so this is gonna
be another unboxing video as you might
have guessed from the title because
there are a ton of boxes that are
containing different packages and items
and components and hardware that I have
not seen yet or I have not unboxed
obviously I think there's one or two
boxes that have already been unboxed by
either me your wifey sauce but we'll
just pretend that I never saw them these
are things that either I've ordered or
vendors have sent me and I just figured
I would share the experience with you
guys because occasionally you like to
see me unbox stuff and talk about it
this should also give you an inside
scoop as to what kind of projects I'm
working on currently or ones that I'll
be working on soon in the near future so
well that said let's just dive right in
with the first package that I have
already kind of unboxed is the X 370
Taichi motherboard from ass rock this is
gonna be the centerpiece to my upcoming
server I'm actually planning a server
build it's gonna be inside of a desktop
Tower and it's gonna feature of course
the X 370 chipset the aim for platform
with a rise in CPU it's gonna actually
be a 10 Gigabit Ethernet video editing
server as you guys know we've got myself
and wifey sauce and Chris TX intern
who's still technically kind of with us
we're all sort of working on the same
files from day to day and its really
been a pain to sort of transfer files
from one system to another and not
having something to really back it up
with we don't really have a concrete
redundant system so far so that's sort
of where this comes in and we're gonna
be talking much more about the server in
the coming weeks so stay tuned for all
that next up we've got an Amazon box
which means I probably ordered it in
here we have oh well look at how
appropriate a Rison cpu this is actually
a rising apu horizon 320 200g i did not
order this this is actually something
that i told a guy who works in our
building to order and i guess he sent it
to me which makes sense because he's
looking for a video playback pc and i
suggested that he go with the
200g because it's great bang for the
buck system or paying for the buck apu
of course at $99 and I guess the parts
have four that have already started to
roll in you've also got some memory this
is for him as well this is a Ripjaws
five ddr4 we've got eight gigs here at
2400 speed I'll probably overclock that
forum to take it to at least three
thousand because memory speeds are very
important when it comes to the design
architecture so this is gonna be a fun
little build it's not gonna be very
expensive so those of you who are
interested in maybe a super budget
oriented gaming PC or something that's
just you know just for home theater
purposes you might want to check that
video out when it finally comes around
next up we've got this box that looks
like wifey sauce has already been into
she's a little raccoon sometimes looks
like she's resealed it with some duct
tape I forget what's in this one ooh rip
saw the razor rip saw there's a story a
short story behind this Paul and I had
been having some streaming troubles for
awesome hardware at my place here in the
studio the Blackmagic intensity Pro
capture card that I had been using for
years has died this is what Paul uses
right now it's not his permanent
solution but it has been working out for
him so I'm just gonna follow suit
because I'm tired of trying to find
workarounds for our streaming setup it's
about a hundred and fifty five dollars
great for streaming I like the fact that
it's an external card so I can actually
bring it along with me when I'm
traveling if I need to stream somewhere
at an event for example CES things like
that next up we have ooh this guy this
probably won't interest many of you but
it's gonna really appeal to some of you
who are particularly into film this is
the small HD 702 right version seven
inch monitors so this is actually for
the new FS 7 camera from Sony that we
recently picked up and this thing's
amazing actually Chris brought his in
the other day and I knew that I had to
have one because the external monitor
that I bought initially with the FS 7 is
just a piece of crap it's like 300 bucks
and I was like three other books that's
it's probably got to be pretty good it's
only a 7 inch monitor no guys this thing
alone is probably twelve thirteen
hundred dollars MSRP it's like you could
buy for that money you could buy one of
those Asus ultra wide back there so if
you thought gaming PC stuff was
expensive you have not entered the world
of film but this is gonna be really nice
you can actually see Lutz as the
I'm applied to your footage and there's
a lot of other cool features on here
that I have yet to explore but very
excited to be using this it's gonna help
our production workflow immensely next
up we have Oh more server stuff I
believe this is from Star Tech and it's
actually a I think it's a quad yeah for
three and a half inch to three five and
a quarter inch Bay adapter so this guy
here we go has a nice look at it this is
uh this is our drive bay this is one of
three drive bays that I picked up and
they're all gonna be identical and you
go ahead and get a plastic wrap here I
don't know if I mentioned this but we're
planning to have twelve drives in our
ten gigabit ethernet server and the case
that we're getting does in fact have
nine five and a quarter inch bays at the
front so we're gonna be able to fit
three of these bad boys in here which
obviously gives us 12 drives and this is
a really nice drive bays first time I've
actually handled one of these it's full
aluminum and a very very solid weight
and feel I love the fact that it's using
SATA power and not molex it does have a
fan no idea how noisy it is might just
leave it unplugged and rely on the cases
own cooling if it's too loud but very
happy with the build quality here this
is gonna be a badass server guys and
it's it's not going to be cheap either
of course it's not gonna be like you
know well ltte status or anything like
that but I'm excited about it it's gonna
be a huge step up from what we're
currently working with here let's move
on to our next box this is yet another
Amazon special shout out to wifey sauce
for blocking out our address on all the
packages ah okay more stuff for our
friend in the office I did advise him to
go with an a/b 350 end gaming Wi-Fi
motherboard from Giga bytes it's the one
that I've been using for all my APU
testing so far it's obviously got Wi-Fi
it has an MDOT two nvme supported slot
on it more reliable BIOS here than some
of the other be 350 boards that I've
used with these new ap use additionally
I've told to get a WD black PC I ate em
to drive a 256 model so this should be a
pretty nice combo this along with the
2200 G and the eight gigs of Ripjaws v
let's move on to this what is this this
is this is a heavy bastard you also have
ooh oh I know what this is I just need
to know how to open it okay this is our
10 gigabit ethernet switch from buffalo
for our server so the way it's gonna
work is we'll have our server tower
hooked up to this guy and then from here
we'll be connecting two or three of our
pcs actually three or four of our pcs
and it shall be glorious now this is a
fairly cheap 10 gigabit ethernet switch
all things considered the great thing is
that it's an 8 port switch so it's got
eight 10 gigabit ethernet rj45 seems it
seems pretty sturdy switches be tripping
okay we have one more box but there's
also a couple products that I've already
unboxed that I still wanted to show you
but they're in the other room give me a
second to go get them all right
here we go our friends at asus sent us
over a couple things recently and the
first of which is one of the things i
checked out at their booth at CES this
year this is the blue cave AC 2600 dual
band Wi-Fi router and there's a lot of
interesting features about this thing of
course it's all smartphone app enabled
and things like that tons of security
features it's got all these awards which
obviously means it's good it's a very
nice very compact router kinda looks
like a Bluetooth speaker to be honest
now I typically don't do many router
videos or reviews because the ROI on
them just isn't that great quite frankly
but if you guys have any interest in
taking a look at this let me know if
there's enough demand for it I just
might do a fun video on it and check it
out the next thing they sent me may be
of more interest to you this is the ROG
Strix Z 370 G gaming Wi-Fi AC
motherboard and it's the first Z 370
board that I've been sent that is
actually of the micro ATX form factor
and the fact that it's that it has
built-in Wi-Fi for micro ATX it's kind
of it's it's kind of doing it for me
right now you know what I mean I really
like micro ATX as a form factor from
other boards because it's sort of a nice
stopgap between full ATX and mini ITX
and the fact that you still get four
dimm slots for you know using an
expansion memory that further there and
2 by 16 PCIe slots so if you want to do
multi-gpu set up or have an add-in card
something like that gives you a bit more
flexibility than your standard Mini ITX
but also isn't quite as big or take up
as much room in the case
an ATX port so this is really nice the
heatsinks are pretty I wouldn't say
they're built 100% with functionality in
mind or thermal dissipation in mind but
they do look nice it looks like you've
got six SATA ports there one MDOT two
slot don't really ever feel the desire
to have more than one end got to slot on
a board unless it's like a high end
board and I'm planning to raid some
and then we've got some rear i/o here
for USB 3 wondering if that's Intel
Gigabit LAN perhaps ps2 ports and video
outs if you wanted to go the APU route
and your Wi-Fi antenna connectors
beautiful board very very nice I
probably won't do I'll be honest I
probably won't do a dedicated review on
just the board but I might do a build
with this thing I haven't done a micro
ATX system built in a while we've got
our last box here we've got our last
package and I've saved the biggest one
for last
of course I also kind of don't know what
it is I have a feeling it's something
that I've ordered oh I remember now
yes this is a very important piece of
tech ladies and gentlemen that you guys
are gonna love this is the nerf rival
precision battling assault rifle because
reasons I I bought this this was an
impulse buy 4 stack attack we are gonna
be doing one stack attack every single
month for the rest of the year and we're
trying to up the ante in terms of what
kinds of attacks different punishments
and other crazy things we can throw into
the mix to make it more entertaining and
fun for you guys so this was this was
just I just I just couldn't help myself
easy load hopper it contains 100 and we
end includes 100 of these foam balls
maybe they're plastic I don't know this
thing probably hurts maybe it hurts
we've got a trigger that's good that's
good for guns tactical rail and it's
it's battery-powered is 100 Oh 100 FPS
it gets a hundred frames per second but
guys I'm gonna cut the video up here
because if I wait any longer I'll
probably unbox this thing and start
shooting everyone in the office because
that would be hilarious but this is all
to say we have a ton of new stuff coming
up soon so get subscribed check us out
on a floatplane so you don't miss
anything you can watch stuff a week
early without ads I'll put a link to
that in the description below you can
also toss a like on this video
if you enjoyed it it helps us
tremendously apart from that guys thank
you so much for watching have a good one
and I'll see you all in the next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
