hot line to content yet because I've got
more for you today today we're actually
gonna be addressing this little tube
right here the one let's go in from our
top GPU to the vrm heatsink the reason
for that is because if you watch the
last hotline Tube video and you already
know that we installed these really nice
addressable RGB custom-made GPU back
plates from the folks over at v1 tech
they did a fantastic job but they go on
top of the existing RT X xx atti back
plates that I already had installed so
it makes them extra thick and so the top
GPU back plate is actually pushing this
tube upwards you can kind of see it's
very obvious how crooked it is compared
to the tube to its right
before it was really nice and straight
it was parallel with the other tube now
it's completely bent out of whack you
know if this was like sort of my first
time go at custom water cooling I would
probably be ok with it but this is hot
line freaking too and it needs to be
perfect so today we're gonna be
addressing that trying to fix it now the
reason why this warrants its own video
and why it's not just a quick and simple
fix is because I want it to look good
not just function and what I mean by
that is I could easily just pop in like
a four millimeter riser for this fitting
elevate it and that would get patched
and clear the GPU backlight there but it
would look terrible because then it
would no longer be even level with with
the tube to its right and that's just
not gonna fly so I'm gonna have to find
a whole new creative way to run this
tube from here to here and I have no
idea how I'm gonna do that yet gee
willikers what's that thing in your hand
it looks sad and probably doesn't
perform well you'll be much happier with
the iron claw RGB Gaming Mouse from
Corsair it has a lightweight body and
contoured shape that's perfect for palm
grips and larger hands an 18,000 dpi
optical sensor built to last Omron
switches and seven programmable buttons
are sure to make this your new favorite
pointer click on the link below for more
info I do have enough fittings for an
army fittings and adapters and stuff so
I have no shortage of equipment to work
with and that's that's gonna be pretty
key to get this exactly how we want it
and I also have a bunch of spare tubing
as well so that's not a problem on a
side note I'm also using this as an
opportunity to drain hot line to which
needs to be done anyway if we're gonna
work on fixing that tube and refilling
the loop with distilled water
as most of us know by now any colored or
dyed fluid that pretty much anything
that isn't pure h2o is subject to
clogging your loop over time and that
can actually lead to reduce performance
in terms of thermals and and even gaming
performance if if the thermals get
really bad so we're sort of killing two
birds with one stone today by the end of
this video
hotline 2 will be filled with distilled
water that's on the agenda guys let's go
ahead and start by draining this
son-of-a-bitch can I say that can I say
that without getting people on time I
guess we'll find out alright I've
drained this guy as much as I can you
can see there's still some fluid in this
tube for example and this tube but
that's okay because we don't need to
like take out any of these tubes anyway
they can just sit there without without
issue this is the only tube we're really
removing today so shut up phone but you
may have noticed that the remaining
fluid in the loop is actually clear it's
not pink that's because I spent a good
half hour just cycling the loop with
distilled water adding distilled water
draining some adding more distilled
water draining some more until they
pretty much flushed all of the pink
stuff out and we're left with just good
old distilled water that'll give us a
little head start when we're done fixing
this tube and ready to refill the loop
for good so now we got to figure out
what to do with this guy now like I said
before we can't just elevate this
fitting and continue going left because
that'll just be very jarring to have
these two tubes running the same
direction parallel but at different
heights that'll just look really weird
so one alternative I'm considering is
elevating it running the tube straight
back as opposed to to the left that way
it's not so obvious how mismatched these
fittings are so they'll go straight back
over the back plate and then left and
then up back into this fitting I don't
know how it would look but it might be
worth trying let's give it a shot and
see how it goes alright so this is where
we are now after I've played around with
some of the fittings you can see that I
added a little extender here I think
that's like four or five millimeters at
the bottom just to elevate this fittings
really
can get over the GPU backplate so
ideally the tube would go straight back
and to the left into this 45 right angle
fitting but you can see that there's
hardly any room for the tube to make a
turn so once it goes straight back and
makes it and hooks a left turn it's
gonna have to make a really sharp left
to actually get into that fitting and I
just don't think it's gonna make it but
I mean if you look at a tube like this
you definitely need to account for extra
distance taken up by the bend itself
anything tighter than this is gonna kink
the tube or just won't look very good so
that's already a bad sign and
additionally I'm just not sure if I'm a
fan of how this is gonna look like even
with that tube in I think it just kind
of throws off the aesthetic the fact
that there's just all fitting here and
you don't really see much tube anymore I
think we're gonna have to go a different
route so this is what I'm thinking
remove the extension again put this to
the left again remove this guy and go
left and instead of going back and up
we're gonna go up and back so you'll be
able to see more tubing it'll be able to
clear the GPU backplate because we're
going up first and over as opposed to
the other way around and maybe that'll
do the trick so let's try it out
all right the new tube is in looking
pretty good now it looks a little bit
more curvaceous than than I anticipated
that's mainly because we don't have much
distance to work with so it was kind of
difficult making these really tight
bends but I did I did the best I could
and overall I'm really happy with the
results it definitely fits in the design
language of hotline 2 and more
importantly the run is now parallel and
perpendicular with the other lines in
the loop so it looks really nice plus
we've got a lot more clearance for our
backplate you can actually see more of
it now which is a nice bonus that pretty
much concludes our surgery work for the
day I guess at this point we can go
ahead and refill the loop booter back up
and see how she looks
I never get tired of drooling over the
PCs that I make and this is no exception
you guys let me know what you think
though I think we can officially say
that hotline two is 100% complete and I
don't plan to make any changes to this
thing unless some issue should arise
knock on all the wood again this is my
primary gaming PC I will not be doing an
ounce of work on this rig which ensures
that every time I look at it I will
think happy thoughts and be overjoyed so
um yeah that's it guys thank you for
watching this video let me know what you
think of hotline twos new look and feel
free to toss a like on this video if you
enjoyed it to get subscribe for more
tech content on the way thank you guys
so much for watching
have a good one and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
