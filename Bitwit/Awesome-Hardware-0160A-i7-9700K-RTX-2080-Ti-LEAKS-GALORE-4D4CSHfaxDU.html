travel yeah and also consequently mists
some hardware at the beginning and the
end of the summer but now we're back
there's a hard sacrifice to make but
we're we're also jet lagged very so if
we seem a little bit low energy on this
episode that's why you guys will give us
a pass on that I'm sure Internet is
always very forgiving oh yeah an
understanding at any great we're glad
that you're here thank you so much for
tuning in to episode 160 this is side a
and should should go should also lead
into the fact that we split this show
into two halves alright second half of
the on Paul's channel everything we
should shoot him going on here and
makeup in today to make a sexy I pulled
us up and I can see what we look like Oh
God I don't want to look at myself right
now
this is not good now this is a bad idea
it's terrible just another week no we
shouldn't we're troopers we're hardcore
and we care we care because we care and
on this show you can buy things Wow they
made you to continue drinking that's
sweet alright we drink things we drink
because of things that are usually
liquid and contain alcohol so cheers
Cheers
excuse to all of you out there for being
here occasionally we will use uses use
some foul language because we are just
foul people like that it's not warranted
though we use it we use it carefully and
precisely so if you have a problem with
that you've little ones around adult
language warning make sure that they're
you know only adults around only mature
people's like ourselves we also sell
things in our in our respective stores
my store is bit late tech you gonna
check it out
I've got some pretty good quality shirts
and dust bats mouse pads sweaters
glasses actually some of the glasses
that were to get out of right now or
Paul's glasses store Paul's hard net we
both go through the same merchandise
who's great he's the best and and his
stuff is really high quality if you'd
like a way to support us by also getting
something physical something tangible in
return that is really high quality feel
free to support us by buying something
for either of our stores get physical
 that song automatically play any
time when loads are we can just use that
for free yes that's profit off of that
speaking of let's say if I get if I got
your video flagged thank you spot on to
the octave but will yell Johnson at you
at the end of the show if you buy
something from either of our stores
double Johnson if you buy from both of
us mm-hmm
saying that so it's what's your city
that's a tease right it's yeah but she's
from UM from Greece girl from Greece oh
god I never saw Greece I've never seen
Greece does that make me a bad person
that's worth a watch if you've never
seen it is it worth a watch now here in
2018 or was like was it worth a watch
like maybe five to ten years after it
came out and now it's worth that's still
that's worth the watch it's a musical
right yeah kind of a musical it's no
Olivia newton-john thankless no kiddo
Olivia newton-john yeah and the NB TV
that is like it's Chad's basically just
an extension of the internet you guys
can look up anything you already know
more information than we'll ever know so
it's always somebody's fun having you
here chat she's from Australia sister
fun fact because there's obviously gonna
be a gang check everything about Olivia
news Joe I have people tuned in to
awesome hardware for all the information
on all the important facts are presented
here this is gonna be a great show I'm
so glad to know that you're here and I
think
that's it right we can just dive into
our first yeah we should be able to move
on to useful useful seeing useful things
yes so let's transition let's transition
into saying useful really quickly I see
the donations coming in super chair and
on YouTube chat so much no donations no
don't listen to Paul keep doing anything
if you like to you don't you're not
obligate
we're gonna answer them all at the end
all at the end so just keep giving us
money we'll get better to give my m-my
half then no that's also false lots of
false and veneration here
that's better mixing it in with the good
in for answer we're gonna answer your
question better if you will be asleep by
that wall WC about Nvidia launching a
turing mobile lineup
all right so turn GPUs starting with the
GeForce r-tx 2080 mobile GPU WCC of tech
states that this is an article that's
mixing publicly available information as
well as whispers I have heard from
surprisingly technophile ik Birds
technophile ik techno philic no fili AK
Tech nope no it doesn't say fili X
there's techno philic Birds
techno phallic techno fact hey now I'm
seeing this article completely
differently and now things are
interesting I am so why so why are the
turing mobile GPUs so techno phallic
I'll uh well you know they're definitely
they're definitely coming soon even
though we don't have any official word
we do have laptop manufacturers hinting
that that a mobile r-tx card or mobile
archaic GPUs sorry is dropping soon so
this isn't Nvidia coming out and saying
hey guys there's been no official
statement battle from Team Green was
this laptop manufacturers sprinkling
some teasers here and there while
nudge-nudge wink-wink type stuff one
might reasonably presume NVIDIA has made
mobile graphics cards in the past yes
they have and so this is now we've got
some device IDs on github I see yes so
that's how they spotted the r-tx 2080
max-q with the turing tu-104 em
semicolon one EAB the the Tia tu-104
indicates the GPU Turing and tu-104 is
the GPU used in the r-tx 2080 the em
perhaps indicates mobile or
max Q one of the other both the same way
the same device ID was spotted on
another database with the device
description where actually if you scroll
down this little screenshot had had like
it actually listed some GeForce r-tx
2080 mobile with the same device ID
right up there in top left corner so you
know these Turing max-q chips I'm
circling it with the mouse cursor that's
brilliant
as long as you have mouse cursor enabled
that should be perfectly adequate making
that abundantly clear
so the these trade may execute chips are
gonna have a hopefully amount a
manageable TVP because it's gonna have
lower clock speeds as the max Q chips do
and we have a slightly more refined and
efficient architecture going down to 12
nanometers now so so so so hopefully
cooling won't pose a big issue in
slimmer laptops using these GPU or using
this particular GPU because again we're
just talking about the RT X 2080 max-q
right now the RT x 2070 and 2060 max-q
will probably come eventually but we'll
have to wait for those because the xx
the art the full-size desktop GPUs that
correlate to those are not launching
until later this year down the line so
typically what NVIDIA has done in the
past is Lord release the desktop GP
first on the mobile will follow the
correlating local GP will follow so if
you were hoping to to get your hands on
maybe a more cost-effective or
budget-friendly Turing mobile mobile
Turing GPU laptop you might have to wait
a bit longer until the full-size desktop
GPUs are released first have to wait a
really long time at the prices for the
desktop variants or any indication yes
yes absolutely things things are lagging
say the least and yeah I guess more more
updates on these mobile GPUs as we get
more information but that's all we know
for now and and that's
not even a lot because because it's all
speculations that's all to be shot
none of this is probably true at all
it's just from techno Falcon birds this
is where we're all getting this from so
who's to say but we we have more juicy
news that is a bit more concrete and
kind of scandalous poo scandal steaming
handle illegal witness illegal little
ended missus tsmc has yet another
employee or ex-employee now for sure
that's been charged with trade secrets
theft
ooh whoo juicy thank you what's the
punishment for that in Taiwan um I bet
it's death I hope no that's terrible
thing to say but we'll get there we'll
get there
a former tsmc I'll give you the the
bullet points here the former tsmc
employee was arrested recently by Taiwan
police which means it's happened in
Taiwan obviously and has been charged
with stealing trade secrets to his next
employer which is Shanghai hua Li micro
electronics or HL MC the charge includes
counts of IP theft and smuggling trade
secrets of vital 10 nanometer and 16
nanometer silicon fabrication
technologies over to his next job at HLM
C shameful curious to see if I wonder if
he's actually gonna still if that jobs
still on the table for him at hom see
after this whole thing it's like nope
you're you're you're damaged goods bro
known as Chow by digit times I hope
that's just I didn't give the last thing
but I hope that's just his his full name
like you know share
he's just chow this guy doesn't have a
first or lesson he's just
I'm just child I hope that's you
probably wanted tonight it's like Shou
Shou Shou like Shaolin bow I'm hungry
don't let's just talk about that you
brought it up oh I didn't yeah your
fancy Chinese pronunciation dick the
ex-employee was arrested by Taiwan
police indicated a breach of trust
before he could flee tsmc to HL MC a lot
of acronyms there they were in Taiwan
foundry companies are already struggling
by the way with the extreme costs and
the complexity
of developing these you know ten
nanometer and newer fabrication process
notes and having someone just coming in
an ex-employee or whoever tried to just
basically jeopardizing billions of
dollars of R&amp;amp;D it's not making their job
any easier and it's certainly not
bringing ten nanometer products and such
to US consumers any sooner either so
this goes back to what is the punishment
to Taiwan for someone who's for an
employee that secret that's what I led
with that was my question now we've come
full circle all right damn good at this
so what happens if I can badasses uh I
don't know it didn't didn't say I I hope
it's something like I don't want them to
die because of it it'd be really kind of
 up but it should be bad enough to
like set an example so that people just
don't do it because it's I don't know
why would this guy risk so much money
exactly
money wasn't involved or if the
punishment wasn't really that bad like
even if you get caught there's low risk
even you know soso money either HL MC
offered him ton of money or maybe a
high-ranking position at their company
for betraying tsmc who's to say whenever
I hear about like industrial espionage
and stealing trade secrets and
everything I always think of Dennis
Nedry from from Jurassic Park oh like
the guy who got eaten by the t-rex yeah
yeah yeah wait no he's not no no he gets
eaten by us he gets Raptors just know
this the spitter miss bitter and yes
miss berry and the Jeep but yeah we're
not the beginning you know he's meeting
with the guy and like you know he's got
the can of shaving cream where to store
the embryos in yeah you never have a fat
guy right yeah what's that act it has
Nedry he's Newton Newman he's Newman
he's Newman no I mean that's not his
name that's what he's doing on Seinfeld
I don't know the actor's name but those
are the things I know from but yes it's
very much yeah that's that's a perfect
example really yeah don't be a new miss
just I think there should be some sort
of punishment for being a Newman you
should be called like the the Newman law
the Newman hammer will be brought down
upon you Wayne Knight Wayne that sons
someone said wingnut yeah we got a
double comprehension Wayne Knight okay
you don't hear that name too often is
the name you should know he's big actor
has been yep but he's also traitor so
 push Gilman um character played
how do we get so off workers engine here
let's move on okay
Samsung CEO sort of a CEO CEO of mobile
division anyway says it's time it's time
finally to deliver a foldable smartphone
oh wow to the masses it is it is finally
here well almost right through all right
this is article from hexxus thing saying
I never thought there would be a folding
phone right I never see the day I mean
you never thought there'd be a smart but
you ever thought there'd be a phone so
Samsung's DJ Co was the CEO of the
mobile division said a foldable
smartphone first of its kind will launch
wait for it this year that's that's like
oh that's like in the next three months
are already working on this cray cray he
didn't reveal much info but he did say
that the device would be would still be
useful when it was folded so whether
it's open or folded it's gonna have
functionality and must use
nanotechnology like Iron Man's suit it
is probably going to be exactly that
whoo I hope they built they build like
Jarvis in built-in Jarvis would be sweet
but not like the Jarvis the Indian video
demo that just plays loud music and
causes a ruckus what you remember they
had like a little Jarvis in the demo at
the the spaceman in the suit
and then all of a sudden little robot
arms are like starting like play music
and they're dancing and the robot guy
comes back - yeah that's yeah
that's bad that I got I got some Jarvis
mines from that but but like a lesson I
ology see so you think that's an
association you probably made in your
head at some point that most of us
hadn't really I totally got like an Iron
Man and Jarvis vibe from that scene that
Charlie Jarvis is like a voice you
talked to Jarvis and he responds and
says you know well yeah right away sir
whatever tells you that that's why I
said it was like a dumb and he's on the
Jarvis you know he can control
mechanical machines but he's he's a mute
a mute Jarvis
with I feel like there's so much of
Jarvis long this is him that is in the
voice though like if you if not then
that's just any given robotic AI that he
could attributes like there's any any
work of science fiction yeah but it was
like him the robot interactions it's not
a natural fully pulled up some days
should i it's not a connect is a total
connection
pull back me up your chat is it a blue
hue man tell me you thought of Jarvis an
Iron Man during that Nvidia demo let's
settle this I thought of it's not too
late to change your sword fight I
thought of like there's like a blizzard
I think there's a blizzard
cinematic from Starcraft where where
there he's where one of the Marines is
suiting up and that's what it reminded
me of see how I never thought that it's
just to very distant perfectly I've got
lots of people thought of that anyway
we're getting off topic so let's let's
get back on track here what okay
Samsung seems to be struggling with and
this is indicated by the words of their
own mobile CEO they seem to be
struggling with how to deliver a
marketing message that's gonna convince
people that they need a phone that can
fold like what why why they're trying to
figure out like how do we sell this to
people and my thought was if you fold a
phone that means that it can fit in your
pocket easily but when it unfolds it can
be much larger than a device that you'd
be able to put in your pocket so it's
almost like you have a tablet
say is 7/8 inch tablet that can fold
down to serious like legit pocket size
that you have on you will at all times
is that not a good enough reason to sell
people like I would I would think that's
pretty cool and if you know when its
hold it it's just kind of the size of a
regular would be four or five inch
smartphone
I missed the phone that they used in and
the matrix and the first matrix you know
it was like oh yeah doing like that
yeah old if it's two pieces it could go
through like that and then you could do
that thing like when you get the call
you you know yeah yeah those I think
they should bring those back although I
don't know what you just roll down with
your elbow I have many skills super
powers he's playing he's flexing hard
but I don't know I I feel like I feel
like the sliding thing it worked for its
time but it also seems a lot more like
likely to fail because it's like a lot
of like hardware so dip it's the
nineties where the nineties are coming
back you right now nineties a big
eighties eighties hot for a while there
everyone is doing those the eighties
stuff now then that's gonna be what
night the 90s has been coming back
Stewart stone wash jeans no chain
wallets like huge everything that came
from the 90 should stay in the night I'm
waiting for the Zoot Suit thing to Timmy
to swing back around there is a zoot
suit store on Harbor Boulevard I know
it's been there since I was in high
school I know the drama kid back when
sky was was was just you know going
crazy back not that I remember that of
course I'm way younger than anyway no I
love the 90s I had to love the 90s I was
I grew up in the 90s that was my but I
would have loved to grow up in the
eighties more but I still like that I
grew up in the 90s because everyone can
feel I like
ladies by watching the eighties like
kids movies and I like the ETS and the
Goonies and stuff like that I guess
mainly Steven Spielberg's work you calm
down
what calm down I don't know I don't know
sense of danger probably getting some
homeward-bound vibes like they're gonna
they're gonna try to stay at home I know
so it's like what what are they looking
at let's move on let's move on what's
next Cal 505 open beta
that's open and so the embargo just
lifted the Raby battlefield 5 rotterdam
videos so gaming sites like digital
foundry
Eurogamer and pc gamer i've been trying
out the new game with our TX bond with
the RT x 2080 thanks so they're testing
out the RT x 28 e TI with great racing
work with our TX bond and they're kind
of measuring the performance here
digital foundry noted some scores with
their 22 20 80 TI demo running
battlefield 5 1080p resolution was
averaging about 60 FPS 1440p resolution
42 50 fps and 4k was getting under 30
frames per second so still can't play 4k
with our TX on oh well that's our K X on
so I don't know obviously the game the
game itself the drivers for the card and
the hardware are still not fully
optimized because it hasn't been
released yet to the public but if this
doesn't change much or even if it
changes a little bit that's just a
terrible game right there it's really
bad like I don't know RTX on is gonna
take your performance so badly at least
from these numbers that I'm seeing here
that but look how accurate the
reflections and the puddles are you can
see the puddle reflection then then
you're sacrificing your your in-game
accurate
see your in-game accuracy in you're
aiming who cares about are helping ready
and accuracy when you're immersed for
how pretty and it's like you're right
there
and in this particular reimagining of
what World War two might have been like
this is exactly miss wait this is World
War two
it's where World War two or one or two
students do which is weird right because
battlefield one was World War one wasn't
it and why would why would why would
they go to Battlefield five I mean they
came to rebrand the world wars for quite
some time yeah like we used to be easy
we had we had we had one and two oh that
was a hero bar you tell them hero I was
a big boy soldier boy tells a Bigfoot
bark hey quiet dogs whippersnapper
this doesn't bode well because the thing
is is that people still care way more
about performance than they do next-gen
graphic technology at the end of the day
and you're right you're totally right
who the hell is gonna be looking at how
accurate the reflections are in a real
game I'm just gonna go before in a
fast-paced game like Battlefield 5
you're you're never gonna like stop to
smell the roses you're gonna be too
frantic and busy killing people left and
right and try not to die that you're you
won't you wouldn't even notice if r-tx
was on or not but if you did turn it on
you pay let's say a thousand bucks plus
4 and r-tx 20 ATT i like of course you
would want to have r-tx on because
that's a huge part of what you just paid
for but now your performance is getting
tanked because of how I don't know how
much of a first gen technology this is
and that's what Eurogamer even said
early this this has a lot of promise in
the in the grand scheme of things in the
long run but right now it still feels
very much like a first generation
technology so I don't know 60fps at
1080p for a thousand bucks for your
graphics card it does not I don't know I
don't know well you know what you know
we need bright now Paul we need some
really hardcore confirmed and stable
leaks to back up to back up this card
and the whole r-tx
Turing business let's move on to leaks
maybe maybe that'll pull us out of this
rut to have not not fully trusting this
whole r-tx launch and the performance it
offers ok this articles from hot
hardware and the latest leak that they
found a lot of people have found shows
the RT x 20 80 TI the very card we were
just talking about scoring much higher
than the GTX 1080i in 3d mark well for
that price let's freaking hope so but
someone sent how did this leak come
about well of course video cards dot-com
just happen to receive some juicy
screenshots or images man video cards
dot-com they've got it they've got to
have like so many informants just
running amok so someone who sent him
screenshots but someone just sent him a
bunch of screenshots of an RT X xx atti
scoring twelve thousand eight hundred
and twenty five points in in time spine
which is being reported by them not
video cards but by the leaker as a
thirty five percent increase over the
1080i however pop hardware's own
collection of Pascal benchmarks has
shown that this is this figure is closer
to the 25 percent game which I think
sounds more realistic it's at any rate
it's the it's the highest score from any
single car that they've tested including
the Titan and again for the price for a
gaming geforce card I would expect
nothing less if not more video cards
explained in a follow-up tweet they said
the score itself was sent to me a few
days ago as far as I know no one outside
of Nvidia and
or partners had the drivers at that time
so it could be fake or using the wrong
drivers unless it was from an Nvidia
employee or a dan board partner I wonder
it's also it also makes me curious like
does video cards really not know who
leaked this to them like wouldn't the
person who leaked it I don't know I I
guess it could go either way like what's
in it for them if if they don't take any
credit for it do you think you could
still get paid if you leaked information
to a site like video cards com
anonymously could they still
theoretically pay you legally I have no
idea I mean I don't know how I don't
know what the legalities are paying
money for something like that or like at
this point you know it's it's very easy
to fudge up you know some results some
3dmark results or something like that
and take a you know picture of the
screen or something and enough
information is out about the cards to
put stuff on there to make it look
reasonably you know accurate and who's
to say because in another few weeks or
however long it is until actual reviews
can come out that that actual reviews
will come out and then this will be
forgotten so you know speculation is
like is it actual employee who decided
to take a picture of this and send it to
their friend at video cards that they
know somehow or did video cards mock
this up themselves in order to post
wherever the source might happen to be
it's in order to post it to get a bunch
eyeballs and people talking about it and
traffic to the website yeah I mean my
opinion would be the latter
I just another fan of leaks
this is your segment you're doing a
segment right now on leaks no you're
providing because everyone loves leaks
but I don't like them because I actually
report on these products for real it's
part of my job
so the leaks affect me differently than
they do the regular your average
customer there has to be some sort of
distinction there but at any rate let's
talk about another way that's cuz we've
got another one the until quarry 909 B
is switching gears here the 9700 K 8
core CPU has been overclocked allegedly
just 5.3 gigahertz on it from wulftec a
new website woof tech wolf the
interesting woof tech mr. clean okay
that's good it's good stuff Paul you
keep that up deep deep bed scores have
been leaked 5.3 gigahertz on air
apparently previous leaks are so the
9700 k overclocked to 5.5 gigahertz on
liquid with a super high voltage of like
1.53 something that's a lot of voltages
a lot and a city bench score of 250
points in the single threaded test and
eighteen hundred and twenty seven points
in the multi-threaded test that's very
high the latest leak however that we're
talking about today shows the chip
running at five point three gigahertz a
bit but slightly more modest than the
five point five but that's on air holy
crap Oh with a more reasonable voltage
of one point two one five volts that's
actually really good if this is true of
course so it's very blurry kind of you
know looks like it's in Chinese maybe
cpu-z shot right there and it's you know
this could be well this is an
engineering sample it's an es sample and
you can see right there's an es rat for
the clock it does so it is an example
who's to say it could be Bend it could
be big they could have hit the silicon
lottery here with this one maybe that
was the point um
at any rate the the cooler that they
were using was just a thirty dollar deep
cool gamax 400 with four heat pipes I
think another reason if this is all to
be true that we're seeing fairly decent
overclocking results with relatively low
voltage
with a air cooler a dinky air core at
that thank you
could be partially attributed to the
fact that Intel is now featuring
soldered IHSS on these chips as opposed
to their crappy thermal interface
material that they've run on previous
generations that could help immensely
I'm sure it does help immensely from a
lot of testing that other you know
outlets have already shown so it's
unclear what motherboard they're using
but there seems to be a surprising lack
of vrm heat sinks on it so motherboard
says right here is a gigabyte technology
z3 70 or sultry cameltoe
wulftec I mean article says yes it does
seem to be it did say like I didn't read
the fine print of every synthetic screen
shot they literally said we don't know
what motherboard this is so with five
seconds Paul was able to here's more
information from their own article than
they were
we're also insure of the dates which
this upload took place yes actually it's
like the biggest text at the top of the
screen I didn't see that I wasn't
looking I wasn't looking for it at the
time I was reading the text and looking
at the scores great great detective work
wulftec very unimpressed by whoof text
first articles that we're talking about
here in the show because there and then
the geeks core is just really quick
geeks chorus deep bench scores sory
the chip is running stock for this test
reported a single core score of sixty
two hundred and ninety seven points with
a multi-core score of thirty thousand
one hundred and fifty two points oh wait
hold on
perhaps they were talking about the
motherboard during the overclocking as
the over the motherboard you spotted was
specifically just for the Geekbench
scores the geek bench test that that may
be May
that's it that that would make a little
more sense I'm going to take all that
back we take everything back we'll take
you guys do great work you're a solid
journalist and we have nothing but at
most respect to you
there's the screenshot right here
WCC of tech though wulftec's women roof
deck also yeah a thirty thousand one
hundred fifty two points score in the
multi threaded test putting it well
ahead of the eighty seven hundred k
again I would sincerely hope so um also
a much higher single-threaded score than
the Rison seven twenty seven hundred X
as as we've seen from both the the
rising generations so far single
threaded scores have fallen behind
Intel's mainstream flagship chips just
it's got higher NPCs it's just faster
clocks all that but a lower
multi-threaded score than the 2,700 X
because the core i7 for the first time
ever the flagship core i7 chip as a part
of Intel's mainstream lineup he's not
multi-threaded has eight cores and eight
threads so obviously the 2700 X is 16
cores is gonna help it achieve a higher
multi-threaded scoring threads 16
threads sorry you'll have to look to the
core I nine ninety-nine hundred K maybe
as a would be a more fair comparison to
the 27th or X as that has the same corn
thread count now but just the 9900 Kagan
to cus probably a lot more than 27 X I
would imagine but could also potentially
be notably faster we'll see but that's
gonna wrap it up for leaks we only had
two weeks today but they were big weeks
took a long leak on all you guys leaked
so let's move right along to pimp my PC
oh good we're back with rating your rigs
or not reading your rigs really but just
help any guys out trying to trying to
build you a better rate see at least
this is first ones from Josh and make
you say feel self-conscious you feel
really safe classroom
tear you a new one 7600 K at 4.7
gigahertz a hyper Evo 212 a Suzy 270 a
16 gigs of crucial ddr4 500 kW D end up
to drive 4 terabyte hard drive 480 gigas
and this distance D fantex and through
pro case and a rave Max vampires
750 okay huh love the case love the card
old-school and two Pro motherboard and
RAM look great all right you've got
ketchup and mustard on your 24-pin ATX
and your your your GPU cable doesn't
look all that great either even though
it's black and flat it's kind of I don't
know so some sleeved extensions would
would do D some good it's just it's
lackadaisical it's it's very blah
yeah it's very kind of juice more
intention and also you know this this
the enthu Pro it came out at a time you
know this early this is early in in sort
of a new stage I feel like of cases and
popular things with cases the power
supply shared was not popular was not
was not very much of a thing when when
when this case came out and then pass
through for the GPU power cable is sort
of an awkward position
yeah if you have a nice sleeve cable
with a nice clean swoop coming out of
there then it's okay than that it's just
it's still a little too far down you
might still consider going back through
the rear pass throughs on the
motherboard tray yep rather rather than
straight down there that we could we
could use a bit of a dusting it looks
like we maybe had a quick pass of the
hand over there as you were maybe
preparing to take the photo but if it's
not thorough it's just not going to look
good
I'd almost prefer that even coating of
dust but what else I mean yeah just just
some cabling some cabling work we've got
some old stray cables we've got some
cables that are other otherwise colored
I would not I would upgrade my cooler
first I'm in the hybrid 212
it's with a 7600 K inside of that case
he's got it overclocked it's not if it's
4.7 that's yeah respectable true I mean
I just think for the cooling both for
cooling like cooling performance and
and you know some may be a cosmetic
facelift to a degree yeah I mean it was
like I would pick up that would pick up
the looks if you're if you're gonna
invest in something like that yeah at
the same time you know if you're gonna
spend 150 bucks on something you could
upgrade from a 1062 it 1070 well that's
just that's all I'm saying before you
I'm thinking like I'm talking like a $40
40 to $50 cooler okay whereas the 1070
is gonna cost you a couple hundred
jaqen even if you sell the ten set sixty
used you're gonna pay a couple hundred
for the cars so I'm just saying a quick
and easy upgrade in a different league
of its own is you know upgrading the
cooler to something a little bit more
classy okay might not hurt but yes I do
agree with Paul that performance wise
you should look into upgrading your GPU
because of 7,600 case still a great chip
it's gonna last you a long time but the
1060 yes that's that's where I'd spend
the money cuz all in all you got a nice
clean overall build and a nice
assortment of hardware - I would say
indeed hold on Josh no except we have
Rob Rob Rob Rhodes 7700 K and then MSI
Izzy 270 gaming m7 motherboard 16 gigs
the veal super looky-looky juice 32
speed memory then we'll take 240 a io
then we'll take 750 watt RGB power
supply 850 Evo 5 degree SSD and when 805
case tough tough cable management so
tech 1063 gig mini they got on a
Craigslist deal during the GPU
apocalypse interesting ok so yeah the
kill manager in this case anyone's not
known for their cable management yeah
that's kind of go grommets rarely ever
do they have grah
look at the light show though definitely
looks pretty sexy lit up yeah kela
management could be much improved I
think a lot of kind of a haystack going
on at the bottom of the case near the
power supply it's that and that's I mean
it's mostly that area everything else
looks pretty well-rounded yeah I would
say I think you're doing the like the
fact that you're taking a side panel off
picture with the flash isn't doing me
any favors here yeah but like you know
you're doing the best you can with all
the cables you got coming off of the
thermal take yeah you like those those
just tend to have a lot of those so yeah
that's rough no I don't know put those
cables at the top but about the top so
they have to round them awkwardly around
the frickin MOSFETs or you know äô
itself this a Wi-Fi card maybe as an
add-on maybe or maybe I think maybe
that's why fine I am uh also okay I
don't know obviously you got a good deal
on that card it does look a bit dwarfed
in this case looks like there's a lot of
extra room here and like a fat beefy GPU
would just make it look a lot more
aggressive again just add wood fill
things out and fill things out again I'm
just you know with with the whole
pimping aspect in mind I guess sighs
would would matter to some degree in
that regard but everything else looks
good it's clean with consistent good job
Rob good job thanks for sending that
moving on we've got rank rank let's race
you're by old rain dizzy dizzy puzzle
then FX 6300 overclocked to four
gigahertz in stop cooler whoo hyper X 8
gigs 1866 megahertz at GTX 950 which is
overclocked that's from EVGA along with
an air arrow cyclone that's a one case
fan one extra and a $2.00 Walmart LED
strip oh sure it's hot sauce it's a
five-year old PC so it's a five-year old
PC with a few upgrades
temperature looking good alright first
thing is like how how do you even game
or put the system under load without
your ears blowing out from that stock a
and B cooler because that is one of the
loans
I mean it's overclocked I don't know
what the 6300 runs that stock i it's
been a while I forget so I don't know
how much of an overclock for Giga here
it is but yeah that might that might be
loud 3.5 3.5 so it's decent though
alright so you got it you got a lot of
consideration goes into like you you
you're working with limited you know
this is a very limited budget system I
mean it's actually a decent little
balance between the the GPU and the CPU
I think in this situation do that cable
like yeah that's the main thing standing
out to me is your supplemental CPU power
going across here and I I'm guessing
just the case there's probably no
options up here I don't know what else
you could do with that if that's the
case here an extension might be helpful
for you just to give you more routing
options to let you go around the side or
something like that
if you always write under the card on
the left side yeah that is an option
sometimes to go up that way as well long
enough I mean again it's like how much
more do you want to invest in this but
if you can find something like that yeah
for cheap then might be worth
considering yeah I think I decided with
Paul here any any improvements
aesthetically that you could make to
this rig you would do so I would suggest
you do so as is without spending
additional money yeah if you're gonna
dump more money into this system at all
then I would suggest trading up for a
new platform yeah you should be saving
for a new system at this point cuz
you're five years old yeah but you know
I bet I bet at reasonable resolutions
and 1080 1080 and 720 this is probably
perfectly accurate little gaming system
so there you go I would consider if
you're gonna invest in something an SSD
might give you a little bit more kick
out of the system because I do believe
he said he's working with 7200 rpm hard
drive yeah yeah you could get an SSD
like a 240 gig or 480 gig SSD that you
could use with this system you know just
do a clean operating system install and
that would give you more a more
responsive overall system and then you
carry that SSD over to a new system when
you when you upgrade that eventually
yeah that's good
yeah thanks sir John Polk's we've got
John Polk's it's a new build with
horizon 2400 gee that's a Raven Ridge
APU they're overclocked to 4 gigahertz
an 8 gig kit of Corsair lpx he's got an
asus rog strix be 350f motherboard with
an ml 120 a open cooler master it's got
a 250 gig WD SSD in there and it looks
like some ll series fans from Corsair
this is all taking place inside of a
cooler master max master box light 5 ok
all right so let's take a look here oh
okay kind of like your little compacts
in it there it's very spacious
yeah efficient and and tears were I will
not fault you for the computer being
down underneath whoa look at you got it
raised up off the ground there yeah you
know could be higher well here it can be
too much higher because your desk is in
the way but you should do a ceiling
mounted PC these days yeah but that's
that's reasonable the inside of the
system looks pretty clean for the most
part yeah I would say all right so since
your system Mario looks pretty clean
we're gonna get nitpicky right so you've
got this cable that's kind of coming off
of your AAA oh just the I don't know
whatever the pump pump cable that's kind
of in front of your vrm heatsink maybe
tuck that around so that you get a full
shot of your heatsink it's not cover
it's not overlapping sure
and then also where's the GPU no GPU
because you have an APU that's fine I'm
not gonna say get a GPU because if you
don't need one then don't get one but
you know what your that's kind of a
benefit to you if you want to buy a
sleeved extensions
because you now have fewer cables to buy
um so maybe just one for your 24-pin I
mean you know maybe put that money into
some sleeves SATA cables you've got
three SATA cables here that are very
visible especially since there's no like
beefy GPU covering them up or anything
maybe you know if you wanted to make it
a bit more showy to be a very sexy
APU build maybe get some sleep
extensions for those and it's just me or
do the hoses or the AO tubes look a
little bit kind of no they're great a
little bit they're fine
okay and every night I think they're
fine they're totally fine again I'm just
being nitpicky everything looks great
though everything looks great I could
see I could see you dropping a I mean
depends on what you're using the system
for and what games you're playing like
if all you if you're playing fortnight
this is perfect yeah I could see like a
GPU and a cpu upgrade and the system
which would take it you know it could
take it pretty far but yeah anyway
well it's HD PC it's less aesthetic
right naturally build up thanks John
we've got ant in Italy and that today
that right 6700 K H 170 motherboard 16
gigs of vengeance pram geforce gtx 1066
gigabyte gaming x h 75 AO SSD and yeah
okay interesting you have an h 170 board
but a 6700 K I'm wondering if you've got
a really good deal on the CPU yeah any
rate yeah um it's not a complete waste
the 6700 K runs at a higher frequency
than the 6700 but of course yeah
different motherboard would would allow
you to overclock and you've already got
you know
are you on there yeah but it's sometimes
but maybe you're just not into
overclocking could be that what's what's
this like this looks like a camera wrist
strap attached to the top here in exam
it's like a guitar pick or something
that you and that GPU sag or something
maybe just holding it up yeah it doesn't
even look like it's pulled taut really
yeah it looks like he's hang in there
it's just an artifact he's just you know
like people put little figurines and
stuff in the ends I think that's what it
is
you have mismatched front intake fans
yeah one red and one white make up the
top one red because the case on the fan
on top of your case the top of your case
is also red so it's already and the
white fans already outnumbered might as
well just get one more man in there yeah
make it all matchy-matchy sleeves
extensions would do you wonders here and
it looks like not much you can do about
that Wi-Fi card and the cables coming
come on yeah well I mean if you have
some more space behind the motherboard
tray could pull some cables back you
know your things up a little bit really
but yeah that's that front fan this is
the main thing that's me altogether a
very solid build thank you very much
an athlete and that concludes my half of
the show yay Wow we made it through
without did passing out I guess we could
still do some Q&amp;amp;A and Jonathan's okay
alright let's do all right are we gonna
answer questions or we it's alright fine
this answer question there aren't too
many good good i'll in the interest of
time here because pollen eyes brains are
ticking against the clock do do not
accept any more donations
no more any questions that you guys have
that you want to do if you were about to
donate this able for pulse after yeah
just when you cut off and we'll continue
on Tom's brims Mitzvah Norwegian krone a
long time no see started cleaning dust
out of my PC but ended Maudie
ended up modding my evolve ATX and
started to upgrade starting upgrade
project to ptg from soft to be nice that
sounds great
also Paul HTPC yes it's coming that is
2020 where I thought about that today
2025 I'm thinking about it made me feel
very very fulfilling all the time teddy
tiger $20
Wow thank you sir or madam hopefully we
will be buying hopefully we'll be buying
a rising to rig in the near future but
I'd love to meet you guys sometime and
geek out buy you a beer until then use
this $20 to buy something worthwhile
take care of guys thanks teddy you know
until I give you a beer
Cal grab that oh I'm on it red or black
well grab the whole thing okay
we're gonna pound all three right now
right I just whenever we drink beers
that are sentient people yes I always
feel bad for not remembering who sent it
in so I put this this is this is from
guts from Kansas City these beers are
fantasy nights in a milk step nitro
six-pack but that's that no that's not
what it is they're immune excel Brown
lagers KC beer company so there's a
Hefeweizen Google dumped cold and the
dry hopped farmhouse ale okay I was
thinking there's some joint milk Johnson
21 I'm gonna try the brown lager that
sounds interesting
I'm gonna do that too and it's Munich
style you're just in Germany that's true
it's so relevant all right Thank You Gus
thank you guys free treatment thank you
very much
Teddy tiger for your generous donations
MB 67 $13 37 cents welcome back I
enjoyed seeing your social media posts
from the places that I used to frequent
back in the day nope nice glad you
enjoyed them I was pretty good about
social media on this trip I was posting
frequently to Instagram doing lots of
stories and Twitter not quite as
frequently but definitely got some
tweets in there it can be it can be very
easy when you're having fun and
traveling to forget about social media
just you know you're it's kind of
counterintuitive you're like trying to
unplug and get away but then you're like
no I should be somewhat working
connecting with the viewers and stuff so
I'm glad you guys I'm glad MB you enjoy
both the post that Paula never making
mainly mine
yuk nut $4.99 put this towards an RT X
2080 CGI yes
now we're one very small step closer to
affording a thousand dollar-plus
graphics cards that's good
every level every little bit helps where
you can just wait for videos in this one
Thank You Huck nut Daniel Mullings 5
euro hey
I'm familiar with the euro is just using
this how do you think the 2070 will
stack up against the 1080 especially
with no release date well 2 euros here
to eurozone 2070 they said October they
did say October so to play out I think
well against the 1080 against the 1080 I
think it will outperform the 1080 but
maybe not the 1080i I think it will be
somewhere in between that's a pretty big
gap from the 10 agents and Ti you know
it's decent jump it's a bigger jump than
10 72 1080 that's for sure it's hard to
say though it's really hard to say if
you look at the price which is what
79927 t27 D is supposed to be able to be
bought for $4.99 oh I'm thinking over
the chinnis 120 81 $5.99 for the not for
the founders edition or or or for other
more expensive versions at $4.99 I which
is about the same price as a 1080i yeah
so you would think it would perform in
the same range yes yes again my guess is
somewhere between 1080 and 1080i which
side it leans more towards remains to be
seen but we'll have that information for
you seen enough thank you very much mr.
Daniel Mullins next we have Tom's brims
myths 15 or we
Crona once again probably will end up
upgrading to 20 atti from an IE DCI and
I think prices are okay and I'm thinking
upgrading to 7700 K from 7600 K or
latest i7 is worth it if you're asking
if it's worth upgrading from city 7
educated or to 7700 K from 7600 I don't
think so Wow sorry they rarely freak out
like that you need to go in doggie
timeout sorry about that guys
you loud mother effers alright Paul
brought down the hammer and the dog
Jenelle quiet oh the camera moved oh why
did you call him back in here geez we
just can't win so I think if you're
buying a 20 atti
then don't upgrade your 7600 k2 and
lowly 7700 K especially if you're saying
that the 2080 I pricing isn't an issue
for you go with the 9999 hundred K or or
horizon seven 2700 X that would be my my
advice curse this is all speculative and
we wouldn't recommend doesn't really
start where before you actually see
these on it well of course not we're not
Tom's Hardware that alright so Mike
booth $10 you advised me on starting a
PC building business last year did we
okay I started I hope that's going well
I started build bit build code UK and
I've uploaded some PC builds to YouTube
including one for a guy that works on
Doctor Who
no nice thanks channel is bit build I
like that I like it because it sounds
like it starts with the same three
letters as my channel so it's obviously
pretty good
everyone go check out bit build on
YouTube and and you know what be an
active member of this community watch
one of his videos maybe one of the
recent ones and let him know how he
could maybe improve if there's a knee
you know think you can help them with
constructive criticism is always
appreciated
I assume he needs to improve because no
one's perfect Paul are you perfect do
you never need maybe you not need to
improve are you saying you never need to
improve very great what's the talk about
no cool perfect Paul wasn't talking
about himself
that's a surprise I there's lots
of ways I could be better no I I don't
know that that's just what I would want
for myself so I was offering the same
thing to Mister bit build but I was just
I was just looking for a way to
criticize every constructive criticism
on your suggestion to offer constructive
criticism true true
criticism ception at any rate thank you
very much Mike booth I hope your channel
we need to move on and do my half of the
show before I lose the ability all right
we're gonna go we're gonna go into the
sixth gear here nordic gapper or - $10
$1 pampered either a stay ray-traced fam
let's hope that it's phrase never
catches on I get here thank you very
much mister gapper you need the r-tx ops
hell up
Rams I wonder if that's your real last
name that'd be freaking awesome
$10 hey guys welcome back any chance Ram
prices Rams has a question about Ram a
little brain drop anytime soon I've been
tact trekking the same 16-gigabyte kit I
bought a year ago and it's still in the
same it's the same tutor dollar price
tag a new egg thanks I don't know if
rain rain prices will drop no I don't
think so I mean no science I don't know
it's hard to say but right now if they
it seems like if they hadn't dropped and
with with news and
stuff that's come out in the past couple
months maybe they're just kind of stuck
but you know I don't know yeah there you
might just want to bite the bullet and
spend the money but just do it yeah use
me you can buy a kid I ran for maybe 170
if you look hard enough maybe 150 if
you're lucky Black Friday's coming up
this Larson 100 dick with DKK Dutch
Danish Dean okay okay
at any rate 100 of something you've
given us love what you do what would you
guys do Thanks I love what you donate
which is 100 DKK Danish clearly Danish
Krone thank you very much soon soon eh
sorry mr. Larsen that's easier to answer
yes and thank you guys so much for all
your questions that's gonna do it for my
half we love you too should we do
Johnston's all at the end of near half
yeah okay
I'm gonna sign off don't go anywhere
guys follow the link in my description
if you're watching on YouTube or just
stay where you are on Twitch and also
feel free to do timestamps free if
anyone would like to do table of
contents and stuff I would very much
appreciate just put in the comments and
I'll hit it and thank you thank you so
much and we'll be right back don't go
anywhere
