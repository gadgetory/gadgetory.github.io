Shave Club hi what's crackin everyone
welcome back to the channel today we are
taking a look at a brand new line of
products from the folks over at ek water
blocks this is their fluid gaming series
liquid cooling kits the one I have on
hand with me today is one of free that
just hit the market not too long ago
this is the a 240 G which stands for 240
millimeter radiator included as well as
the G denoting that this does come with
a GPU block as well it includes
everything you need to cool your CPU and
your GPU with a custom loop which is
pretty sweet for only 240 us that's
insanely cheap especially for ek quality
components and the way that they're able
to lower the price on this so much is
because it's all aluminum pretty much
say they've kind of opted out of copper
this time around for this particular
series and they're just going with
aluminum components that includes the
CPU block the GPU block the fittings
aluminum radiator so that's why this is
an incredibly light product but it also
makes it much more affordable than the
copper alternative and a big issue with
that a lot of people have with aluminum
when they hear that word paired with a
custom water cooling loop is the issue
of galvanic corrosion but I did a little
bit of research and apparently that is
only a problem if you're going to be
fornicating different metals together in
the same loop so if you had you know say
aluminum fittings but a copper water
block then you could speed up the
process of galvanic corrosion but in the
instance of just using aluminum for the
entire loop we should be perfectly fine
I believe ek has found a working
solution around that issue as for the
other kits that are available in this
all aluminum lineup there's the what the
a 120 and a 240 which are fitted with
120
and 240 millimeter radiators
respectively but neither of those come
included with the GPU block this is the
only one that does the a 240 G hence the
the letter G at the end that you can
actually cool both CPU and GPU out of
the box as far as support on the GPU
side and and how the water block works
there it's pretty much a universe I
don't wanna say Universal but it covers
a lot of ground on the high end of
Nvidia as Pascal GPUs so right out of
the box you get full support for
founder's edition cards including the
gtx 1070 1080 1080 TI Titan X and the
Titan X little P so definitely a wide
range of options the last thing I want
to mention here this is sort of the
roadmap or the game plan for today's
video I have here behind me you've
probably been looking at it is January's
PC of the month this is a high-end
skylake and Pascal build featuring the
7700 K and a water-cooled GTX 1080
you can see here it's pretty much all
decked out with a IO glory right so
we've got a Kraken X 62 currently on the
7700 K and the GPU is EVGA a hybrid GTX
1080 which includes a 120 millimeter a
IO built right onto it so what we're
going to be doing today is swapping out
the existing cooling solution in this PC
with the a 240 G kit and sort of
comparing the thermals between both of
those and I think this is going to be a
really interesting comparison because
we're kind of downgrading our radiator
solution here if you think about it
we've got a 280 and a 120 working
concurrently on their respective
components whereas we only have a single
240 millimeter radiator to cool both our
CPU and GPU now that being said there's
more to a custom loop or any water
cooling loop for that matter than the
radiator alone I mean we're using high
end you know high quality EK materials
here probably a much higher quality pump
than what's in either of these AOS and
so forth so at the end of the day it
should be a fun comparison at the very
least and I'm super curious to see how
it all stacks up so on that note I'm
going to go ahead and shut the heck up
let's start swapping parts out it's
probably going to take a while but we'll
get through it
circle back run some tests and see once
and for all what this liquid cooling kit
is made of the Phi's aluminum
alright guys the loop is finally done
several hours later this took a while
and I'm going to go ahead and just go
through all the things that worked for
me and the things that didn't so I guess
we can start there this took a long time
this is a full-blown custom loop after
all so we're not dealing with simple to
install a iOS if you've never done
custom water cooling before thankfully
the instructions the ek provides are
very clear and well thought-out but this
is going to take you some time if you
are the type of user that's just looking
for something that's a quick and easy
install
this is not the product you're looking
for also I forgot to mention that the
included tubing is 3/8 inch soft flex
tubing as you can see here you'll please
forgive my saggy runs they don't look
the best I kind of wanted to leave some
additional slack just to prevent any
sort of kinking so this was all function
no form so to speak so I apologize if
this is hard to look at but in my
defense I feel like I could have made
this loop look a lot better had ek
included some angled fittings in with
this kit the fact that you only get
these standard fittings and no right
angle or 45 degree angle fittings is
kind of a bummer and it sort of forces
you to use a little bit more slack with
your runs because you don't have angled
fittings that can point directly to
where you want to go so that makes
things a little bit challenging it
doesn't look quite as elegant as it
could be and I guess that brings up
another talking point in the sense that
since it would be ill-advised for you to
mix any other metals into this loop such
as copper brass etc in order to prevent
galvanic corrosion if you did want to
spice up your loop and add some angled
fittings in here they would have to be
aluminum which kamae knowledge it's
pretty slim pickins when it comes to
aluminum fitting so if you wanted to
tighten up the runs a little bit or just
kind of you know make the look your own
it might be a little bit difficult to do
that hopefully EK sells their own
aluminum fittings that are you know that
are actually angled a la carte if they
did that then it'd be smooth sailin last
few things I want to mention here before
we dive into thermals maintenance is
something to consider if you're looking
into buying a
like this because with an AO it's a set
it and forget it type of deal for this
you kinda have to keep an eye on it it's
a custom loop you hand tightened all of
the fittings and you could have easily
effed up so you know look into your
system once in a while and make sure
it's not flooding and maybe you know if
there is a leak yeah there's there's a
higher chance there's just there's a
higher chance that you'll get a leak
with a custom water-cooled loop and so
that's that's the risk that you have to
be aware of and that's additional
maintenance should any problems occur
all right that's all nice and gravy cow
but shut the heck up and give us the
temperatures already okay you asked for
it so first thing I want to say is we're
pretty much using all the same settings
that we were on the original January's
PC of the month so we're still rocking
the 7700 K overclock to 5 gigahertz at
one point three seven five volts we
still have a gtx 1080 mind you this is a
Founders Edition just because it was you
know compatible with the the cooler that
we have here the waterblock I should say
but for the most part we're running at
the exact same frequency of 2065 Max and
then that sort of slowed down a little
bit to 2050 but still a pretty nice
overclock that was set on both of these
GPUs an identical overclock at that I
should mention that I've also kept the
ambient temperature in my room the same
to 26 degree Celsius throughout the
entirety of both these tests and we're
testing GTA v 4k max settings for about
25 30 minutes and despite what you see
here all the thermal testing was done
with the side panel on just like it was
back in January so the old system the
7700 K the CPU got up to 76 degree
Celsius the new system with the new EK
water cooling kit 76 degree celsius
identical temperatures that's actually
pretty crazy considering that the kraken
x 62 that what was on the original
january piece of the month was a 280
millimeter radiator dedicated only to
the cpu whereas here we have just a 240
millimeter radiator we've shrunk it a
bit and it is sharing and it's also
cooling our graphics card so that's
pretty impressive that just goes to show
that there is more to a loop than just
the radiator and it's also the quality
of the the blocks themselves the palm
assuming all that sort of stuff and then
the graphics card so on the old system
with the the EVGA hybrid GTX penaity we
were getting 65 degrees Celsius under
load that was the hottest it's pretty
much got during our gameplay 65 degrees
Celsius this bad boy 52 so that's a
pretty massive drop that's over 10
degrees 13 degrees difference honestly
these are pretty impressive numbers like
well beyond my expectations honestly
especially for a single 240 rag and I
think that's cool I think it's red but
even if you have a smaller or more
budget case that has limited radiator
options it's nice to know that you can
cool your CPU and GPU very well with
just a single 240 red so summing things
up here I think for 240 bucks you are
getting a lot for your money and I mean
if you think about it you like the EVGA
hybrid GTX 1080 usually for a GPU that
has an AI o built onto it I feel like
that's an eighty to a hundred dollar
premium right there and then you've got
you know your the Kraken X 62 which is
about 150 bucks let's be conservative
and say 120 for a solid a i/o quality a
i/o so that's like almost 240 bucks
right there that's almost the price of
this entire kit so I don't know and this
kid is definitely again we've already
talked about it is not going to appeal
to everyone but honestly guys if you
just care about performance and
thermally speaking then this is a very
viable option I would say so let me know
what you guys think that's pretty much
all I have to say about it very here's
