channel hope you're all doing well so I
just got back from AMD tech day where
they were talking about rice and thread
Ripper and Radeon rx Vega the embargo
for a bunch of information pertaining to
both of these huge launches coming up
really soon has just lifted if you're
watching this video at the time of
uploads so we're going to talk about
most of that info today there's a lot of
info that I won't be touching on because
it's just too much to contain in this
one video I want to save something for
the reviews when those finally go live
so hopefully that's cool
additionally you're going to see this
same sort of content pop up on other
tech tubers channels and other media
outlets all at the same time because of
this embargo lifts so on that now let's
just dive into some of this stuff here
starting with Verizon thread Ripper
thread Ripper is AMD's response to
intel's high-end desktop platform which
is currently the core i 9 series of
skylake x right so basically what we're
seeing here is more i/o more storage you
get quad channel memory support 64 PCIe
lanes on every single thread Ripper skew
that we're discussing today very
exciting that's not something that
Intel's currently doing or has done
frequently in the past so starting with
the flagship part the 1950 X is a 16
core 32 thread CPU with a bass boost
clock of 3.4 and 4 gigahertz
respectively additionally all thread
Ripper SKUs were discussing today will
feature a 200 megahertz XO far boost so
technically as long as the cooling
solutions are adequate you should be
able to see a 4.2 gigahertz boost on the
1950 X and the other SKUs we'll be
talking about in just a moment
again 64 PCIe lanes on all thread Ripper
SKUs quad-channel memory support for
ddr4 on all thread Ripper SKUs and
completely unlocked chips for
overclocking again for all thread Ripper
SKUs very exciting stuff the pricing for
the 1950 X is $1,000 999 which puts it
right competitively priced with the kora
970 900 X however the 7 900 X only has
10 cores and 20 threads so technically
you're getting 6 more cores and 12 more
threads a math is really hard right now
for the same price with AMD with the
1950 X so that's really exciting this is
just a stupid benchmark in Cinebench
multi-threaded
I'll take all these benchmarks that you
see in these slides with a grain of salt
because they're all whipped up by AMD
but up to 38 percent more performance in
such a test additionally we've got the
1920 X this is one step down 12 cores 24
threads
3.5 gigahertz based 4 gigahertz boost
all the same all the other same specs
apply 64 PCIe lanes quad channel memory
support unlocked and 200 megahertz XFR
boost the 1920 X is going to retail for
799 dollars 800 bucks that puts it $200
cheaper now than the 7900 X but you're
still getting two more cores and four
more threads than than the Intel
equivalent so that's super exciting as
well the third and final chip they
announced this weekend is the 1900 X
this is an 8 core 16 thread part with a
basin boost of 3.8 and 4 gigahertz
respectively and again all the same
features that we've been saying so far
so that's really cool for 550 dollars
that's what this part is going to retail
for here's a look at all three SKUs in
the lineup so at the top end you've got
16 cores for a thousand bucks 12 cores
for 808 cores for 550 of course cores
are really important but that's really
just a fraction of what's good here
quad-channel memory support with an AMD
platform and with so many PCIe lanes at
your disposal you'll really be able to
have your pick of the litter when it
comes to multi-gpu setups or adding in
nvme storage and things like that so
very cool stuff here's a look at some of
the compatible motherboards we'll be
singing along with red ripper featuring
the x3 99 chipset and socket tr4 which
quite frankly is the biggest socket of
ever frigging seen in my life it's just
disproportionately huge but is also sort
of intimidating and awesome we also have
a couple coolers coming to market for
thread Ripper so first off you've got 20
liquid cooler options that are currently
in the works this doesn't necessarily
reflect everything that's going to be
available at launch but definitely
things that are in progress and will
eventually be coming to market soon
these are from brands such as Arctic
Corsair ek water blocks NZXT Thermaltake
cryo rig and EVGA there's also some air
cooled options not nearly as many
because the Red River is probably going
to want some liquid cooled action if
you're going to be overclock
especially but there you have it you've
got some liquid and air-cooled options
also notice the slide claims these
coolers are rated for 180 watts of
thermal design power so we can expect a
TDP of 180 watts for all the thread
Ripper SKUs that we're talking about
today here's a little summary of all
three chips and you can see that the red
Ripper is right around the corner with
the 1950 X and 1920 X coming to market
August 10th and the 1900 X available
August 31st you can actually pre-order
the the top two SKUs of the 16 core and
that's in the 12 core tomorrow July 31st
so that's really exciting you'll be able
to find the chips from 90 different
retailers and boutique OMS such as the
ones listed here including Amazon Newegg
and so forth so that's pretty much risin
thread Ripper in a nutshell that's a big
chunk of the basic information that we
were told over the weekend it's all very
exciting stuff I think it's going to do
a great job competing with Intel's
high-end desktop platform I really hope
it does because it's definitely a
segment of the market that needs
competition obviously rise in 3 5 &amp;amp; 7
have already leveled the playing field a
bit in the mainstream market so it's
nice to see AMD stepping it up and
really giving enthusiast gamers and
content creators more options to work
with so with that said let's go ahead
and move on to Radeon rxv equally
exciting if not more so if I do say so
myself so here's a look at the flagship
Vega card known as Radeon rx Vega 64
look at it there's behold it's it's
absolutely beautiful we're going to be
talking about this and another vega card
actually that was announced over the
weekend as well Vega is really the first
of its kind it's on a brand new
architecture with 12 and a half billion
transistors and that's oh my goodness I
apologize for that asshole
it's made on the 14 nanometer FinFET LPP
process it features infinity fabric and
overall the card has been designed for
higher clock frequencies so hopefully
that's going to equate to higher
performance for the end user as well
here's just some other basic specs we've
got 64 next-gen compute units 4096
stream processors a base in boost clock
of twelve hundred and forty seven and
fifteen hundred and forty six megahertz
respectively bear in mind that this is
for the air-cooled Vega 64 we will be
taking a look at the specs for the
liquid cooled version as well four
hundred and eighty four gigabytes per
second
memory bandwidth that's pretty awesome
twelve point six six teraflops four peak
single precision performance
twenty five point three teraflops four
peak at precision and eight gigs of that
high bandwidth to additionally we've got
this sort of brand-new look from AMD
when it comes to the reference card so
you've got this illuminated logo and
pixel so that's kind of cool it lights
up and stuff an isothermic vapor chamber
designed to keep thermals in check a
thirty millimeter blower style fan so I
believe it was a 25 millimeter fan on
the last generation of reference cards
from AMD if I remember correctly so
potentially that's going to equate to
better cooling may be a bit more airflow
being pushed through the card and maybe
a smidge quieter if that will have to do
some a be comparison testing and also
you get this solid metal construction
Premium 240 grit brushed finish it does
look really nice in person I got to see
it up close and stuff and it does it
does look really cool so good job AMD
this is the new GPU King as they're
calling it's under five hundred dollars
I'll call it the potentially new GPU
King for exactly five hundred dollars
because that's how much it's selling for
five hundred US and this is for again
Radeon rx Vegas 64 air-cooled the reason
why the shroud looks different here why
it's black well if you look at this
slide there's actually a couple
different versions of Vegas 64 so the
one on the very left is just the sort of
familiar black shroud that we've seen in
the past that's going to be the shroud
you get if you decide to purchase the
card individually if you just buy the
card by itself all a cart it's going to
come with that black shroud this card in
the middle here is the limited edition
Vegas 64 with the metallic shroud that
we just took a look at this is going to
be available if you purchase the card as
a bundle or purchased it with one of the
new Radeon packs and we'll get into that
what exactly that is in just a moment
this is going to be available in limited
quantities however so once all these
silver shrouds run out they'll be
shipping all the Radeon packs with the
standard black shroud and then finally
you have liquid-cooled Vega 64 which
comes with no blower fan just an
enclosed shroud here along with some
flex tubing that from what I could tell
in person has some braided nylon or
sleeve nylon I should say around it
which looks really nice attached to a
120 millimeter radiator looks to be
about 35 30 to 40 millimeters thick
includes a single 120 fan of course so
there's just a couple options for Vegas
64 there the other video card that AMD
announced over the weekend was the
Radeon rx Vega 56 and this comes in for
just 400 us putting it right next to the
gtx 1070 actually it's probably a little
bit cheaper than the 1070 right now
because of all the inflated prices but
we can probably expect I would imagine
similar performance with the gtx 1070 so
that's really exciting because I feel
like that's where the best bang for the
buck happens is sort of in that three to
four hundred dollar range here's some
specs on Vega 56 you can see that it's
pretty much just a cut down version of
Vega 64-56 compute units thirty-five
hundred and eighty for stream processors
notice the bass and boost clock or a
little bit slower and then it ramps up
to Vega 64 and then even more so with
the liquid cooled version of Vega 64
because obviously with a more robust
cooling solution we're gonna be able to
crank the the clock speeds up a little
bit further without running into any
thermal constraints so also notice that
board power holy crap 345 watts for the
liquid-cooled Vega 64 so it's definitely
not the the lightest when it comes to
power consumption but AMD is promising
some some really solid performance per
watt at the very least you can also see
here that even with Vega 56 you still
get that full eight gigs of HP m2 which
is there nice indeed
and now let's talk about the Radeon
packs this is super confusing because
everyone was super confused when they
first announced this up the event but
hopefully I can clarify it for you guys
a bit let's let's start with this slide
here here's a look at all the pricing
for the two individual cards so this is
if you if you buy the cards ala carte
you get radian rxt Vega 56 for $400 or
the air-cooled Vega 64 for $500 now if
you look at these pack prices here you
can see that let's take let's take a
look at the Radeon black pack for
example alright
this this features a Radeon rx Vegas 64
air-cooled which you can see here if you
buy that card individually is 500 bucks
but if you buy it with the Radeon pack
it's 600 bucks
so you're actually paying $100 more for
the same video card so what do you get
for $100 more well here's what you get
for $100 more
you get two free games all right and
those titles will vary based on region I
believe in the u.s. its Wolfenstein 2
and prey
Wolfenstein 2 I believe is also going to
support DirectX 12 and Vulcan and async
compute so that'll actually be a nice
title to try out on Vega and
additionally you get a one hundred
dollar discount a one hundred dollar
discount on select horizon 7 CPUs and
select x3 70 motherboards and then
finally you get a two hundred dollar
discount on this Samsung curved monitor
this is the was a model number the CF
seven nine one so this is an ultra wide
34 40 by 1440 IPS display it's curved it
looks nice it's super sexy and it
supports free sink most importantly
however it's the only model that is
eligible for these bundles you can't buy
any other free sink panel at all it's
just this one so obviously AMD and
Samsung are sort of have sort of
partnered up for this launch and then
we're not exactly sure exactly which
Rison seven CPUs or which x3 seventy
boards will be eligible they haven't
revealed that information to us yet so
again the pricing that you see here for
these Radeon packs does not include the
monitor CPU and motherboard itself it
includes the two free games yes but it
includes discounts for the CPU
motherboard and monitors so hopefully
that clarifies some things if you guys
have any questions about the Radeon
packs or Vega in general or thread
Ripper just ask them away in the
comments I'll do my best to answer them
accurately and also off to make sure
that none of that information is under
embargo otherwise I could get in trouble
but that's pretty much it for now guys
that's all I got for you of course
there's so much other information that I
that I haven't even touched on but again
I want to save that for the reviews but
if you enjoyed this video be sure to
toss me a like on it thank you for
enduring I know it was just a bunch of
slides in the talking head
hopefully you don't mind too much and
thank you so much for watching again
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already there's more tech stuff on the
way including reviews of course for all
of this awesome hardware see what I did
there and until next time I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
