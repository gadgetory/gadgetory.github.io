gonna film some bloggy blogg e style
stuff for you tonight
but my camera's having technical
difficulties so I figured I would just
play borderlands and let you watch yeah
so as you can see the voice of my
channel is coming along quite nicely
yeah I have no idea what I'm doing so I
figured you know why not just play some
Borderlands 2 and keep you guys along
for the ride and we'll have some fun
together so I could see my friend
Rachel's on right now oh by the way look
at my assassin level 25 or 27 assassin
loving it I'm currently in the bloodshed
skill tree super badass I have the Joker
skin on I so serious I'm not sure and
it's level 27 it's a little high for
where Rachel's dad she's a level 10 so
I'm gonna switch characters to Salvador
my level 13 guns are which I started not
too long ago with some other friends and
I'm gonna join Rachel she has no idea
that I'm about to join her she is also a
fellow New Ager
so why don't we join love this game this
game is amazing if you guys have been
playing it then you know exactly what
I'm talking about
if not you should be playing this game
you have no excuse you probably have a
sweet ass rig at home and you're not
using it for this awesome game so so you
should do it yeah okay it's badass rifle
oh God
alright let's go find Rachel wait do I
have all my ammo let's just double-check
oh I'm yo fraps in say hi to the camera
hat Rachel's a guy huh
she's commando she says she likes a lot
commandos the class where you basically
throw down a bunch of turrets and let
them take care of the work I thought it
was pretty lame at first when I first
saw it and I was like oh yeah it seems
boring you know just but I guess there's
a pretty good strategy to it and it's
kind of cool because your turrets
actually pull aggro
up and Rachel saying no how do I type in
the game she only knows how to type in
steam why is the loneliest ladder that
you ever see oh yeah there ya go
all right let's kill some people really
why is the type 'button yeah why not hey
no cursing Rachel alright let's see what
I got here I've got some guns accurate a
spear who would name their gun an ass
beater it sounds like the least powerful
thing in the world that's like a tiger's
ass that's that must be pretty powerful
alright I really don't have much pretty
weak sauce at this point
let's go kill some dude okay I remember
this area I think I did this mission oh
yeah Sasson ate the assassins yeah this
one's supposed to be pretty cool and I
actually skipped this mission oh thank
you I don't I don't need help
but thank you for asking
whoa why would you shoot that I was
standing right next to it that doesn't
seem very smart okay I hope Rachel knows
where she's going cuz I sure don't kill
assassin breathe and kill assassin reap
with melee Oh too bad I'm not my
assassin that would be the perfect
mission for the Wesley Snipes that's
what I made my assassin what's this oh
hey oh that's you okay
and I used to playing with the commando
because my two friends are mage and
another assassin so I it's the first
time I all be playing there's actually
the first time I'm playing with Rachel
she was in Europe so I couldn't play
with her now I can playing with a
bonafide commando
guns irken time i can find people there
you are alright everyone excuse me if
I'm a little rusty it's been a while
since I played this game like a couple
days I guess that makes me rusty
I'm also not very used to playing the
hooker and granted it isn't the most
difficult class oh and there I go it's
not the most difficult class but hey
nope I got him I got him dad I okay I
don't got him well yeah I'm more used to
my assassin used to being like stealthy
and like you know cutting around corners
and sneaking up behind guys so I can
just slash them with my knife blade like
cutting edge so this is kind of like a
more of a full force class Panzer Corps
obviously you get two guns and it's
awesome oh hey I hope you like grenades
yeah you love them I can tell righty-oh
ugly bastard Oh God okay I don't like
you
yeah take it all your slack or scag
whatever it is yeah when they're scag
and they turn purple like that that
means they take extra damage so always
go for the purple dudes first lesson for
all your kids
all right and this psycho is being very
psychotic
Wow let's go a lot HP doesn't
this kind of speed or something
little area right there okay you're both
handling and I got some second wind and
I'm gonna gonzaque you yes guns irking
is fabulous I'm actually really liking
it so far except oh my god I'm lagging
I'm lagging this is worse than dying
when's the last time you lagged this is
terrible
well I don't even know what I'm doing
because I'm lagging so bad oh my gosh
this is embarrassing
all right well I killed him I guess
Rachel died she's way over there but but
we got this we got the mission item hey
I've totally stopped paying attention to
the storyline in this game pretty much
it's just been enjoying the characters
and how ridiculous they are and in the
gameplay all the guns that that you get
guns guns and more guns more guns I can
feel them yes our shields okay
these are cool - mmm-hmm
these are pretty weak sauce basically
just to sell sell a bunch of that
okay well nothing here not down arrow
O'Hara
all right
yes dye corrosive acid for all of you
okay
your skank you did okay don't like that
at all
I'm good just let me kill this guy I'm

cool level I'm sure would have done this
mission earlier boom boom oh shut up oh
look at this security we got going on in
here there must be something awesome on
the other side of that door oh not

wrong I was so wrong I thought I knew
everything
