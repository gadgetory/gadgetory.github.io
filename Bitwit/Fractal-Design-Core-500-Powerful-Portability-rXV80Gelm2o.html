enthusiasts apparel awesomesauce shirts
are not only threaded they're hyper
threaded and come factory over cloth get
yours today at the awesomesauce - what's
up guys today I'm checking out the new
Core 500 from fractal design being the
mini ITX phonetic that I am I was pretty
excited when fractal unveiled this case
at Computex and now that I finally have
one in my hands let's see if this new
addition to the core series was worth
all of my childlike giddiness starting
with the exterior we get a solid steel
body with a plastic front panel
incorporating the brushed aluminum
finish that we're used to seeing by now
from good ol FD at the top is a five and
a quarter inch drive bay and you get
some mesh accents on the sides which
appear to be ventilated but are purely
for aesthetic purposes talk about
meshing around I don't laugh at that
don't stop it our front IO lies on top
of the case and includes two USB 3 reo
Jack's and power and reset buttons on
the left side you get generous
ventilation that nearly spans the entire
depth of the case for a dedicated GPU
and on top is an equal amount of
ventilation for a dual radiator that
will circle back to later both vents
also have their own magnetic dust
filters which are removable from inside
the case you also get some breathing
holes on the right side for your power
supply exhaust
at the bottom are four rubber feet and a
dust filter for the PSU that tends to
slide out of place when carrying the
case from the bottom it's like somebody
dipped it in 409 the core 500 s only
included fan is this 140 millimeter rear
exhaust with mounting holes for a 120 if
you're so inclined here we also see two
expansion slots and four thumb screws
for removing and receding the case
enclosure crowbarred not included okay
so it's not that bad but after seeing
the awesome tool a side panel on the
define r5 I think it's time fractal
whips up a similar solution for these
mini ITX cases to save us all from those
few seconds of pain and agony under the
hood we see a rigid steel frame and a
radiator bracket with flexible mounting
strips for either a 240 or 280
millimeter radiator that can be removed
with four Phillips head screws for easy
installation just beneath has a bracket
for the five and a quarter inch Bay that
also houses a single three and a half
inch drive keep in mind that having a
240 millimeter raid
installed will block your five and a
quarter inch bay but a 280 millimeter
radiator requires you to actually remove
the bracket entirely this is done by
popping off the front panel and undoing
the four screws I personally suggest
removing this piece unless you
absolutely need it since it takes up
more space than GTA 5 underneath the
front panel you'll also find a stealthy
location for a two and a half inch drive
when mounting the drive right side up
you'll have to reserve the five and a
quarter inch pay for cable routing but
you can easily avoid this limitation by
flipping the drive upside down and
threading the cables through the small
cutout on the bottom left here's a quick
look at the front panel cables which
seems slightly longer than necessary and
I really would have liked to see some
tie-down points going across the wall at
the front of the case to keep them from
getting nicked by the radiator fans
looming above the core 500 supports ATX
power supplies with an AC pass through
that routes to the back but fractal
recommends units 160 millimeters or
shorter as to not interfere with longer
video cards while full-size ATX
compatibility is appreciated I would
urge those with fully loaded systems to
consider using an SFX unit instead since
you'll need all the extra space you can
get when it's time to manage those
cables you get four pre-installed
motherboard standoffs with support for
CPU towers up 270 millimeters tall and
dual slot video cards up to 310
millimeters long on the right side of
the case is a mounting wall for two two
and a half inch and two three and a half
inch drives granting you a total of six
drives in total totally total the three
and a half inch drives have rubber pads
and use four screws to mount directly to
the bracket while an SSD can be
installed with a combination of toolless
mounting pegs and screws I would say
this bracket accommodates two drives
comfortably but at a third or a fourth
and it begins to feel like a storage
fest especially with all the SATA cables
touching tips at the center a key
speaking of which the overall cable
management capabilities in the core 500
largely depend on several factors
including how much Hardware you want to
cram into it the physical size of that
hardware and how likely it is that the
hardware will be gone in the morning and
never call you again wait what are we
talking about for the purpose of this
video I built a moderately full system
using a discrete GPU albeit a short one
a 240 millimeter radiator a full-size
ATX power supply one SSD and one hard
drive while you do get several tied
downs at the bottom of the case under
the GP
you and a few at the front most cables
still had to be routed in the troughs
between the motherboard and power supply
and all the excess length was
essentially then crammed into a ball
besides the graphics card as I mentioned
before it would have made sense to also
include tie-down points across the front
wall and even along the PSU bracket to
run some cables directly above the power
supply
fortunately cabling should be much
easier for those omitting the use of an
a IO or discrete video card if you don't
plan on doing any water cooling however
I would suggest introducing one or two
intake fans at the top of the case for
some healthy airflow so to sum up ladies
and gentlemen it appears that the
objective fractal had in mind when
designing the core 500 was to fit all
today's popular full-size ATX Hardware
except the motherboard of course in the
smallest case possible and based on my
findings today they've succeeded at
doing exactly that just know ahead of
time that you'll have to pour some blood
and sweat into the build process to get
everything fitted nice and proper but as
is often the case when dealing with mini
ITX well there's still certainly some
things I'd like to see change with a 2.0
version this is still one of the most
versatile small form-factor cases to
date and in my opinion has been the most
promising released so far from fractals
