ant-man tonight I mean obviously the
movies gonna butcher the original
storyline but come on he's like the most
underrated character in the Marvel
Universe
hey screw ant-man man let's go to Vegas
the venturi fans from fractal design
make everything cooler that's right even
you check the link in the description
boy what's up guys welcome to my custom
water-cooled build log this is built
like number 5 where I'm gonna be doing
some custom cable slaving for the well I
haven't really named the bar cooling
system break yet but I should name that
soon but that system is going to get
some nice leaving I've got some tele
asleeping
from the guys over at mainframe custom
super cool guys they do a really great
job go ahead and check their site out if
you're looking to do some sleeping
yourself so you'll see right here I've
got some whites leaving I'm going to be
spray-painting this stuff pink and I'm
going to mix that with a black and gray
sleeving
and do a kind of mixture of those three
colors that really ties in with the
color scheme of the rest of the system
and I'm gonna see if that works because
I've never tried this before some people
online have recommended to stay away
from spray-painting sleeping you're
sleeping teos is kind of like a plasticy
material so I think the paint will
adhere a little bit better than it would
on like a fabrics leaving for example
but we're gonna find out that's all part
of the fun and the learning experience
for today so I've got my ATX pins right
here all my wires I'll wire it up with
them pretty ATX pins so I'm going to be
doing my sleeping extensions for the 4
PCIe cables because I've got two gtx 980
eyes in there
so i've got four of those going in as
well as my 24 pin ATX for the
motherboard now you're probably
wondering how do you go about
spray-painting this stuff and i actually
tried to do a tester I actually cut one
piece about a foot long piece and tried
spray-painting I literally just held it
on I put it on top of a little table
spray painted it and it like literally
just flew off the table label on the
ground
it was ruined so I tried another piece I
took a piece of really thin wire and I
hung the little piece of sleeving from
like a clothesline
i spray-painted it up and down that way
but then it just kept waiting around
like frantically so i wasn't able to get
a really nice even coat on that either
so I've kind of devised a new method
what I'm going to be doing is gonna be
taking these little shish kabob skewers
that I got at your local grocery store
whatever and I'm going to be sticking
them in this piece of foam and I'm going
to be taking individual pieces of
sleeping and sleeping them over the
shish kabob sticks that make sense so
smell like that stick it in there and
there it is the sleeving is all nice and
straight it holds its form really well
and you get 360 degrees of accessibility
to evenly coat the entire surface area
so on that note why do we get started
you
by travelpod member
you
you
alright guys so the cable sleeping
process is finally finished it took me
about anywhere from 8 to 10 hours for
the whole procedure not including time
it takes for the paint to dry and we'll
take a look at the finished product here
it is I think it looks pretty darn nice
that being said I can only confirm that
spray painting you're sleeping can be
done with this particular type of
sleeping because it's the only one that
I've ever done it with obviously this is
a teleo sleeping again
probably the best sleeving to spray
paint because it's not like fabric or
cloth II it's just kind of more like a
plastic and the paint adheres really
well as long as you let it dry fully
before handling you should be fine but I
think it looks really nice the color
actually came out nice too it matches
the fluid pretty spot-on I also did want
to mention that I'm very happy with how
my sleeve kebab method worked out for
spray-painting these suckers just like I
intended I was able to get basically
attack the sleeving from all angles
going 360 degrees around just kind of
spray-painting until everything was
coated and also keeping it rigid and not
waving around anytime I'd spray some
some paint at it was really really
helpful and very effective so I'm happy
about that some snags that I had hid in
my sleeping experience now this remember
this is the second time that I've
sleeved my own cables cable extensions
let me turn this aperture but I hit some
snags this time around that I didn't hit
the first time actually so I was kind of
intrigued by that and also very annoyed
it's very frustrating the first thing
was that I couldn't get one of the ATX I
couldn't get one of the cables into the
connector my heat shrink work was just
too thick and it wasn't fitting in and I
kept trying to shove it in which is
stupid of me it was a pink cable that I
was doing with and I met the finger oils
on on my my fine self they rubbed off on
to the paint and some of the paint
actually came off of the cable sleeving
and so you could see some of the white
bleeding through the cable and didn't
look very good so I had to actually take
the sleeving off and flip it around you
know either like ruin the the heat
shrink job that I had done to get it off
the wire in the first place
it made the cable the slating a lot
shorter so what ended up happening was
the other end that goes behind my
motherboard tray is now short or it's
now devoid of some sleeving
and it just it's definitely an eyesore
but luckily it's behind the motherboard
tray now that could have all been
avoided had I painted extra sleeves I
see I made the stupid mistake of only
painting the exact number of sleeve
pieces that I needed and I should have
known doing this once before that things
are going to go wrong at some point you
are going to need extra everything so
bear that in mind always paint more than
you need because what will happen is if
you have to go back to the drawing board
and paint a new piece of sleeve that
sets you back like hours because you
have to wait for the paint to dry so
it's just a big mess that you can easily
avoid if you just paint some extras from
the get-go
the other major snafu that I had once
leaving these cables was actually not
plugging in the wire but taking it out I
made another I made a lot of stupid
mistakes this time around guys I know
none of you are surprised at all but I
actually plugged in one of the cables
into the wrong hole in the connector so
I had to get to get it out and for
whatever reason I couldn't get it out
you with my ATX pin removal tool that
just didn't work for some reason I kept
trying to yank it out eventually I
yanked it all the way out and the cable
and sleeve came but the ATX pin was
stuck and lodged inside of the connector
still and I looked for for an hour or so
online trying to figure out how to get
this damn thing out because it's really
hard you need the you can't just jam it
with something on the other end because
you those little pins those little pins
on the side are locked into place so you
have to have the ATX pin removal tool in
there while you're trying to get it out
which makes it impossible to push
anything through you actually have to
pull it so what I ended up doing was I
took a piece of really thin wire that I
just happen to have lying around I was
actually part of my DIY kid stuff so I
jammed a wire in there the same side of
the connector that the wire would go
into I jammed it all the way through
until it came out the other end and then
I bent a little loop I just kind of like
twisted it and made it into a J like a
fish hook and then I pulled it and
managed to yank it out
bear in mind with the ATX removal pin
the entire time it was an ordeal it took
me like an hour and a half to finally
figure out how to do it and actually get
the damn thing out so what I will
suggest is buy extra connectors as well
because it would have just been easier
if I had just had a spare connector the
same connector lying around that I could
have just tossed that one that had the
stuck ATX pin in it and just use the
fresh one and they're cheap anyway so
just stock up on a bunch of them but I
think on that note everybody that pretty
much wraps up this year custom build log
number five g's were on five now my
goodness there will be a couple more I
know in the last build la goes like oh
there's only one or two more that'll be
done that's a lie because I recently
officially decided that I'm going to be
using hard line tubing for this build as
nice as it looks you know with with the
soft tubing I think hard line tubing
will look much better with those cleaner
lines and super straight corners and
stuff like that
I've been talking to the guys at primo
chill they're hooking me up with some PT
G tubing and I'm gonna need to get a
heat gun and stuff like that but that'll
be a whole build log on its own and holy
crap I can't imagine the snafus that'll
hit there so stay tuned for that but
apart from that apart from the hard line
tubing I think I just need to add a fan
in here maybe painted pink maybe paint
this cover plate or just part of it you
guys were saying just maybe paint the
x99 or the ring around it I still have
to decide if I'm going to do either of
those if I have the pink fan in here I
might not need to do this at all and
then I think it's just a matter of
shrinking it out with maybe some pink
LEDs or something like that and I think
we'll be good to go and obviously wiring
up the rest of the cables you can see
the eight pin and some of the fans
aren't plugged in some of the fans
aren't even installed yet but that'll
all happen in due time so thank you guys
so much for joining me in this build log
stay tuned for more tech videos coming
really soon hit that like button if you
enjoyed it subscribe to the channel if
you haven't already and I'll see you all
in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
