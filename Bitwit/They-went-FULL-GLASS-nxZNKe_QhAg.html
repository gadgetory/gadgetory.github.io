brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below okay we've got
the h 710 here that means they're
actually doing a refresh of their h
cases the h 400 is gone they're not
bringing that back because there just
wasn't a whole lot of sales or interest
right now for micro-atx and you can kind
of see that based on the dearth of
options in the micro ATX motherboard
sector both on AMD and intel side but
that's a topic for another video but
they've made a few nice changes here for
starters you actually get a smart device
v2 which includes hue to compatibility
and so you can actually have two RGB
channels now meaning that you can
actually sync up things like all your AR
RGB to fans the cable comes under glow
lighting pretty pretty easily and
seamlessly from that single device
they've also added USB type-c USB 3.1
gen2 type-c right there on the front
panel it's a very nice 20:19 feature to
have look at this there's there's a nice
little little slot here for reservoir
mounting I kind of like that option very
friendly for custom water cooling of
course you get the same nice radiator
mounting options at the front looks like
they've got a 360 right there you can
also see they've redesigned the SSD tray
here so there's actually a groove that
goes along the power supply shroud so
you can to lessly mount that tray just
right there in the the cables obviously
go right behind this scale management
bar which is very nice additionally the
actual side panel window has been
improved as well there's a single thumb
screw back here and once that's undone
I'm not going to do it right now because
I only have one hand free but
essentially you can just pop out the the
side panel window with a couple pushpins
it's very nice much more seamless than
the original design and it's looking
pretty good so that's the H 710 and H
710 I of course there's gonna be a
slight price difference between the two
so over here we've got the H 510 I
pretty much comes with a lot of the same
improvements that we saw on the H 710
also you get vertical GPU mounting here
which is which is pretty cool obviously
you want to be considered of airflow if
you're gonna be popping in particular
high running hot running GPUs and make
sure they're not too close to the side
panel there make sure you have ample
ventilation at the front and all is all
good and very it's very reflective
in here sorry we have this cute little
guy h2 10 so the H 200 but newly
improved if you're going mini ITX and
you want more of a small form-factor
build i don't think we're gonna have
vertical GPU mounting here ah beat for
obvious reasons but still the same
lovely case just much more seamless
integration with various features this
is the H 510 elite this is their brand
new chassis so we're kind of using a
similar layout as the existing H 500
however you can see that we have a glass
front panel which looks very nice you
can see those a or to RGB fans which are
140 millimeters they come pre-installed
in the case you'll have to add your own
exhaust fans however we shouldn't be too
big of a problem you know I see some
people sort of concerned about airflow
here but they're not really changing
much from the existing H 500 if you can
see over here on the right side there's
actually ample ventilation going all the
way down from top to bottom plus you
have additional ventilation coming from
the bottom so and regardless of the
material you're using whether it be
metal acrylic plastic ventilation is
ventilation quite simply so I'd be
interested to see sort of an a/b
comparison testing with this and H 500
or similar just to sort of put all of
those rumors to rest but the internal
layout very very nice very familiar it's
not broken don't fix it as they say and
then there's also been some drastic
improvements with the NZXT cam there
developers are constantly working on
making it a better more seamless
software again still very lightweight
very low system resources but we have
these new theme packs that you can
actually download share with your
friends if you're kind of lazy and don't
feel like being creative it's very quick
and easy to do one click on the fly
adjustments to all of your lighting
pretty much changes all the all the RGB
effects inside of your case h - also has
USB type-c right there on the front I
should mention also we have 140
millimeter mount at the top 120 at the
rear it's also worth pointing out that
the smart device comes included with
this case there's no option to get it
without it but you kind of wouldn't want
to go without it especially if it's
coming with those to RGB fans so it's
smart right out of the box this is a
backside look at the H 510 and you can
see that we've got our our smart device
v2 right there it's a very nice low
profile SSD trays that I mentioned
earlier on the 710 I
and 7:10 you can actually see that
they're a bit more I feel like they're
much flatter for better for cable
management gets the side panel on much
easier not much else has changed to
significantly about the backside here
again it's a very smart design you have
that power supply basement with all the
room for stuffing excess cabling and
yeah it's looking looking pretty good
back here in case you're curious about
how the front panel actually mounts to
the case there's there's two screws one
on either side it's very simple
obviously it's a bit a little tight in
here to get thumb screws in here so
they're just regular Phillips head
screws but with those gone you can
simply just pop it out using the same
pushpins that we saw on the side panel
and just just comes off just like that
it's really nice in fact you probably
don't even need the screws honestly
unless you're traveling with the case
shipping it around because the pushpins
feel very secure when they're locked
into place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
