blog and you missed that whole
explanation of what happened to the wall
art gaming PC let me give you the TLDR
wifey sauce put the system in her trunk
one day I had no idea that it was there
I take her car running around town
running errands all day and basically
this happens glass glass everywhere via
the entire front panel completely
shattered broken there's no there's no
fix in this at least the airflow is much
improved but what's interesting is that
Walmart has been contacting me left and
right saying that there's been a defect
discovered apart from just all the other
things that are wrong with it that
myself gamers Nexus Linus tech tips and
other channels have already pointed out
they're saying that these overpowered
systems are actually prone to getting
this weird blue screen so they're sort
of recalling all of them giving you the
people a full refund or a replacement
now some of you guys remember I actually
upgraded several of the parts in this
system and was planning to give it away
I drew the winner about two days ago he
never applied to me so his prize is now
forfeited but obviously the next person
I draw can't get this system it's
completely thrashed so I'm gonna have to
give them a similar system that has
equal or better specs but that's a topic
for another video as for this system as
it is right now I'm gonna actually
return Walmart's phone call right now
and tell them the situation of you know
this permanent case damage to see if
they will still allow me to get a full
refund for this rig and obviously I
would have to swap out any of the
upgraded parts for the original hardware
which I still have still works properly
but we'll see let's let's just give
Walmart a call right now and see how
accommodating their customer service is
but you know what right before I do that
I'm just gonna pop this side panel open
and make sure that the other hardware is
fine because if like the gtx 1070 is
damaged or something like that then
there's definitely no way that they're
gonna take this back let's just see if
the front panel was the only casualty I
really hope so
actually looks actually looks fine I
think we're good I mean the GPUs plugged
in so it's already better than how it
came out of the box all right we're
clear to give them a call the thermal
take a 500 aluminum TG mid-tower
features a sleek aluminum front panel
and two four millimeter tempered glass
panels for breathtaking views enjoy 420
+ 360 rad support at the front and top
respectively and breeze through
installation with the dismantle of all
modular design
step up your case game is the a500
aluminum TG and click on the link below
for more info hi my name is Kyle and I
recently purchased a overpowered gaming
PC model DT w1 lately I've been getting
some phone calls and emails from you
guys saying that I have the option to
return or get a refund for the product
due to a widespread defect the only
issue is that the item was recently
damaged so I'm not sure if that
disqualifies it for a refund yeah it's
actually the case that was damaged as
far as the actual functionality the PC
still works perfectly fine that's
correct if possible correct several
people have contacted me one through the
phone they left me a voicemail and one
through email as well and just to
confirm it is okay to get a full refund
even though the front the the entire
front panel of the the case itself is is
damaged thank you well we'll give that
they're actually gonna honor a full
refund despite the damage I mean I gotta
give them credit there that's actually
pretty cool
sure no problem that'll be it thank you
very much well I'm gonna fill out that
email survey and give that boy high
marks all around I'm getting about 15
dollars back pretty much a full refund
they even paid for the shipping labels
so I just got to swap out all the parts
for the original hardware and box it up
ship it out should be processed in a few
days so that's awesome hold on wifey
sauce doesn't want to be on camera right
now so I'm just gonna shoot from around
the corner honey they issued a full
refund for the Walmart PC really yeah
yes yes they did
that is correct yeah I even said you
know it's fully damaged it's not it's
you know it's not there and he was like
yeah no problem no I shadow you're
worried looks pretty good
listen oh of course I knew something was
different well that was super easy I was
expecting that to be a little bit more
dramatic and certainly take a bit more
time Walmart just made that whole
process so quick and easy that I don't
even have any more content for this
video it's like geez those guys can't do
anything right so I guess now this is
just gonna turn into a boring old blog
where where you guys get to watch me do
mundane crap so she's stupid freakin
like like frickin block the Sun out of
my face which isn't working at all
what's the point of these Sun visors
they're not gonna work I figured of the
bank let's go to the bank all right so
we got to deposit some checks mostly
Amazon affiliate checks from the EU
because they're the only ones that do
not direct deposit damn Europeans always
got to be so tradition unfortunately I
don't think I can take you guys into the
bank with me so you'll have to wait here
in my car unsupervised I think that
makes me a bad YouTube parent that was
easy enough they didn't give me too much
trouble converting those foreign cheques
now we're gonna go run an errand for
wifey sauce and and myself too I guess
we're picking up wine we're gonna get a
nice bottle of fancy wine you know in
the 10 to $20 range kind of fancy the
market we go to is rot up here all right
I'm gonna go with educated guess because
of his wife he approved meaning that it
tastes good and it's also vegan educated
guess is a little wordy though they
could have just called it hypothesis or
something okay III know it's not open
but this this definitely doesn't look
good no I could go home at this point
but where's the fun in that I've got a
couple things in my pocket including a
Walmart gift card this video has really
come from
Circle I don't know who gave this to me
it's like 25 bucks or something like
that there's a Walmart literally down
the street so I want to burn this thing
really quick I also have this $50 visa
vanilla gift card that I got actually at
a press event I forget which vendor it
was but they gave all the press one of
these and it doesn't expire no wait
shoot it expires in two years so I got
to use it quick but this has been in my
drawer ever since I got it like two
years ago I can't remember if I spent
anything on it I'm gonna call the number
really quick to check the balance thank
you for calling vanilla gift card please
enter your 16 digit card number from the
front of your card please enter the
four-digit expiration date located on
the front of your card please enter the
three digit security codes found near
the signature panel on the back of your
gift card your vanilla gift card is
ready to use and have a balance of two
dammit it's still two dollars so I could
get a Nintendo switch game but I already
have Super Smash Brothers ultimate which
is really the only game I need for the
next ten years so the only other thing I
can really think about buying right now
that I actually need is a case for my
switch but it looks like they're pretty
sold out of most of the accessories
because of the Christmas rush so I don't
know guys something I'm leaving here
empty-handed
or not look at this awesome beanie I
found it's got little tassels on and
everything I'm actually getting this
because I'm going to Tahoe this weekend
for New Year's with some friends we're
gonna go snowboarding and stuff I also
just realized that this is actually a
Rams branded beanie and you guys know me
I don't care about things like baseball
and stuff but hey those will keep my
head warm all the same so let's check
out
I just realized I forgot to use my gift
card mm-hmm it's like Walmart gets the
last laugh today all right so we just
got home ready to pour the wine in all
wife he saw still doesn't want to be on
camera it's just one of those days I
suppose but we're actually going to use
this cool little aerator that my parents
got us for Christmas we actually tested
it out at their house on Christmas Day
and half of us were able to tell the
difference doing a blind taste test and
the other half was not so we're gonna do
one more just for the vlog I'm gonna be
the guinea pig and wifey sauce is gonna
pour all right so let me just set this
up really quick now I'm gonna go in the
other room my success is gonna pour and
she's gonna let me know when she's done
all right I'm gonna move this back just
a smidge all right I'll try this one
first okay one of them is decidedly
smoother as less of an alcoholic taste
or a bite at the end of it pretty sure
it's that one there he did one yeah
you're wrong
are you serious yeah hold on oh no I can
tell it's definitely that one all right
guys I'm gonna cut it off right here my
last blog was a little lengthy so this
one's gonna be a little short but I hope
you guys had a great New Year's if
you're watching this on YouTube it's
probably already 2019 I'm really looking
forward to 2019 I think it's gonna be a
great year for the channel hopefully
it's a great year for you guys too and
thanks for sticking around
love you guys have a good one I'll see
