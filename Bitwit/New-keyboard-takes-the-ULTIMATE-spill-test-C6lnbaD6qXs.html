channel hope you're all doing well so it
has been one hell of a new year so far
for the PC market we had a CES that was
barren of new and interesting tech the
once beloved Intel is now on everyone's
poop list and memory and GPU prices are
at an all-time high but amidst all these
events nothing came as more of a
surprise in late January when Corsair
launched another RGB keyboard can you
say shocker okay so maybe this wasn't
the most unthinkable thing to have
happen this year but the k68 RGB does
mark the company's first RGB keyboard
with IP 32 dust and spill protection you
may remember that the K 68 they launched
last year was spill proof but only had
red LED backlighting which totally sucks
unless you love red and only read the
board features 100% Cherry MX switches
and fully integrates with the Q software
but users can also switch through a
plethora of lighting effects using the
function and number keys the secondary
arrow key functions even let you adjust
the speed and direction of those effects
on the fly you're probably familiar with
all the other good stuff like multimedia
buttons windows lock key brightness
adjustment fold-out feet 100%
anti-ghosting and full and key rollover
but the feature I'm focusing on today is
the board's alleged spill resistance I
want to know how much flooding can this
thing actually handle before it goes off
the deep end to find out I'll put the
k68 RGB through a series of three staged
accidents each one more severe than the
last
well the keyboard survived all three
levels or will it be sent to a watery
grave let's plunge into our first
scenario to find out
Oh No
what a terrible accident well that was
unfortunate but I guess that's the way
the cookie crumbles sometimes so if you
guys are wondering why I'm wearing a
different shirt now than I was earlier
in the video it's because we're actually
in the next day I gave the keyboard a
proper 1213 hours to fully dry before
plugging it in again so we're about to
do that now this is the first time I'm
plugging it in alright plugged in looks
like the backlighting is on that's a
good sign it's a very good sign but oh
and it looks like was that there before
the little apostrophe when did that
happen - that happened right when I
plugged it in did it accidentally press
a key all right I'm gonna I'm gonna just
go for some typing here hello my name is
Kyle and I have a book now a lot of
these are typos that's not I'll let you
know what if it's a typo or if it's the
keyboard acting funky do a couple enters
lalala
my wife just walked through the door and
she didn't say hi to me you know oh
there she is there she is
hey honey we're just doing I'm doing
some testing with the keyboard that we
spilled water on yesterday and it is
working perfectly
oh those type on me guys guys guys we
have passed stage 1 level 1 is clear all
right we can now move on to our second
accident which is gonna be as I
mentioned before a little bit bigger
than the last one let's go ahead and see
what's up with that
oh no I'm falling
well that was a doozy I apologize for my
actions back there and believe it or not
that happens on a regular base almost
every day but you know what all I care
about at this point is whether or not
this keyboard is still working so once
again I fired up WordPad we've plugged
in the keyboard already and it seems the
RGB backlighting is working perfectly
fine no issues no misfires in WordPad so
far let's go ahead and type something
what's that one quote they always make
you read at the optometrist it's like
the quick brown fox jumped over the moon
and slapped him in the face hey that
worked nice if this keyboard stops
working properly I will give away 10 of
my GTX ten ATT eyes it's just a test
guys okay - gee golly is a funny
expression that no one should use let's
do some numbers in here one two three
four five six seven eight nine zero and
we'll do all the things yep and there's
work in numpads looking good all the
numbers here above our main keyboard
area oh nine zero yep everything's
looking good guys whew we have cleared
level two holy crap this thing just
keeps on truckin so I think at this
point the only thing left to do is to
put it through accident number three so
on that note good luck little guy you're
gonna need it
all right third and final typing test
ladies and gentlemen I have already
plugged the keyboard in it doesn't look
like there are any sort of misfires here
in our WordPad so I'm just gonna go
ahead and start typing let's do the
American flag what's that thing called
oh yeah I pledge allegiance I forget how
to spell allegiance I'm dumb too the
flag of the United States of America and
to the Republic for which it stands one
nation under God indivisible well I
forgot it that's all I know with liberty
and justice for all
hey it's working it's actually working
all right you know what you know what I
haven't tested yet is like the number
pad so one two three four five six seven
eight nine zero and then all the signs
here and then these numbers right four
five six seven eight nine zero
everything's everything looks fine
I'm assuming that since we got every key
wet if some of these keys work then
pretty much all of them do this thing is
working flawlessly and that's pretty
much all she wrote folks we have
concluded my wacky experiment here and
this thing has passed all three spills
with flying colors regardless of how
accidental those spills may have been
this thing is holding up pretty well and
has definitely proven itself to be quite
resistant to the everyday or maybe not
so everyday spill so good job Corsair
obviously this isn't one of their
flagship high-end keyboards so you're
probably be able to find it for a
slightly lower price then something like
the k95 RGB platinum of course you're
foregoing some of the premium features
like a volume scroll wheel or an
aluminum body this one's plastic but
still very durable in its own right and
yeah guys that's it let me know what you
think about this thing in the comments
below feel free to toss me a like on the
video if you enjoy these kinds of silly
silly little tests that I throw into the
videos every once in a while and
subscribe to the channel and all that
jazz you can also check me out on
floatplane to watch all my content a
week early without ads I'll drop a link
for that in the description below guys
thank you all for watching have a
good one and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
