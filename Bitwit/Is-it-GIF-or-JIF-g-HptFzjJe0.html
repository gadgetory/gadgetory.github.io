quarrels do you have with a soft G did
you get mugged by a gypsy once fall off
the giraffe perhaps afraid of Judah
Jerome's fine
no why it's a gift because just sounds
stupid okay I agree with you on that
good point
but that's not a reason oh it's the
perfect reason and you know what if you
had a stupid name I would call you
something else oh that's oh well if you
were ugly I'd put a bag of your face
ah we are settling this once and for all
I thought you'd never say that
gif also gifts right no that's
ridiculous website I'm obviously right

doesn't sound right it's got to be a
hard G no that doesn't make any sense I
