Computex 2016 has been overclocked by

making the contents of this video highly
unstable click the links in the
description for more info
well we're Coolermaster yes we are they
have too much stuff here and I'm not
even including all this maker stuff that
they have give me a give me a head
scratch ball give me a head scratch get
a little itchy yeah my manicurist it's
amazing he is alright so obviously
there's two really cool things that we
both want to talk about here there's the
master concept too and there's a really
adorable cute little hybrid cooler yeah
so we both want to talk about that but I
think there's too much for us to both
cover otherwise so how about this we'll
split well split it up I'm gonna handle
the cases okay I'll take the power
supplies all right I'll do the I'll do
the coolers the fans and perhaps some of
the peripherals I like the keyboards
instead yeah thanks all right okay cool
wait first off this little guy has
something to say what do you have to say
little guy Wow his words not my son call
for his words all right guys so this is
the master concept case and if you were
wondering how much it costs or when it
comes out
no one knows because it's still a
concept case hence the name basically
this is freaking huge first of all wifey
sauce could probably fit in it basically
what this is it's fully dee
constructible it's completely modular
you can basically tear it down ship it
in a flat box if you wanted to the crazy
thing is is if you look over here and
you see this little case this is
actually using the exact same parts this
was pretty much built from the same
parts that we just saw in that big-ass
thing over there so pretty impressive
stuff what they're doing here completely
modular modular again but have no idea
when it's actually going to be a
finished product and on the market if
you move over here really quick take a
look at this really sweet little cooler
it's a hybrid cooler so it's got you
know liquid and air cooling got some
tubing right here you've got two of the
fans essentially this is really good for
a small form-factor
chassis which is pretty cool you can
also orient it either horizontally like
that or vertically like so so still no
word on pricing it but stay tuned for
this fans Kula masters got fans so new
fans for like static pressure good
airflow balance all that sort
thing they also feature new intelligent
fan control so a big problem with
certain fans if you're in a cramped
space for example for those of you
people who put your cases on the floor
you've actually got your case fans on
the bottom that are really close to the
ground and that's actually going to
lower the RPM so basically with
intelligent fan control if you actually
have a surface that's really close being
pressed up against your fan blades it'll
actually initially the the RPM will ramp
down but then it will ramp back up and
you won't be essentially losing any kind
of cooling performance that way with the
fan control so that's really cool too so
moving on to peripherals we've got the
master Mouse it's an ambidextrous Mouse
it I actually tested it out it's very
comfortable and you actually have a
modular pieces on the side so depending
on if you're a righty or lefty you can
actually tailor it to your liking
they've also got the S version which is
just a smaller one and and there's a
replaceable tops so if you are like a
claw grip user a palm rest user you
actually have a really perfect tailored
fit either way then you've got the
master pulse headphones right here these
are really cool actually they've got
really good phone design a super light
headband very comfortable probably the
coolest feature about this is you can
actually take this plate off and make
them open back or you can make them
close back if you're in public and you
don't want the the sound to leak out or
something like that very cool and then
we've got some keyboards over here you
can just basically see we've got kind of
large medium and small depending on your
needs or your desk size for example
we've also like really improved the the
white brightness on their particular
keyboards just to give it a really nice
white shine and they've got RGB as well
so a lot of cool features over there
that's going to do it for now guys I'm
gonna get the hell out of here before
Coolermaster kicks me out because
they're about to post a tour and I'm
taking up their time so sorry if this
filled feel it feels rushed what what
this is a oh this this keyboard I almost
forgot about this keyboard thank you
Paul this is a mem cannibal so it's
basically membrane but it's supposed to
feel like a mechanical switch it
actually is pretty comfortable they've
actually also put in a steel plate to
make it more reinforced and just give it
some rigidity so it doesn't slide around
it feels very much like a mechanical
keyboard but it is not you can see here
it does have the the Cross Cherry MX
switches there are not switches but the
other would be a what is that thing
called the peg so that you can actually
put in custom key caps and things like
that if you wanted to switch it up and
make it yours and then finally we've got
a kind of a transparent body here with
key caps this is also not a final
product so it could is subject to change
not sure if they're gonna actually put
lettering on the key caps or if they're
gonna leave it blank I actually kind of
like it blank but very colorful super
cool let me know what you guys think of
all these things in the comments below
and I will be seeing you guys in the
next one
really quick shout out to my sponsors
gigabyte fantex g.skill and cable mod go
ahead and check out the links below for
all the stuff that they offer see you
