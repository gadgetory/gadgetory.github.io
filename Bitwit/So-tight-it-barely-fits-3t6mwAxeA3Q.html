imagine if dr. zebras a real person he
probably sounds something like that this
is the century 2.0 follow-up to the very
popular crowdfunded sort of
community-driven century 1.1 which i
never had the privilege of assembling in
so this is truly a first experience for
me there's been some slight adjustments
some slight improvements here it's still
the same size it's about the size of a
console it's notably larger than say an
xbox 1x but it can still fit in a medium
to large size backpack no problem so
potential case if you are on the go
constantly maybe taking this to land
parties or perhaps you just have super
limited desk space especially the fact
that you can orient this chest
vertically or horizontally gives you
more flexibility in essence sensory 2.0
is also community driven it's not going
to be available on retailers like Amazon
or Newegg you pretty much just have to
crowdfund on either Kickstarter I think
I think they do on Kickstarter could be
IndieGoGo but whenever they launch their
campaign which I think should be towards
the end of this month in March if you're
watching this in March that's pretty
much the only way you can get one of
these I think they were quoting around
two hundred and fifty US dollars for one
of these mini ITX cases so not for the
faint of heart you really got to love
what this case can do and really just a
form factor I think is really the bread
and butter here today I'm doing a
step-by-step build inside of the case so
I'll be talking about things that I like
things that I don't like it's gonna be a
mid-range gaming PC nothing too fancy
there are really just demo parts that
we're using for the build but it should
be pretty cool once it's all done the
other thing I want to mention is that
the 2.0 model is only gonna be available
in black I believe they had a
powder-coated white finish for 41.1 as
an option but to simplify things they're
only gonna be doing black for the 2.0
model the quick mention before we dive
right into building the packaging was
very nice it came completely intact and
there was no damage whatsoever lots of
foam lots of cushion makes you feel like
you're unboxing a premium product
because you certainly are now the other
thing is that there's no actual manual
no physical manual that comes included
with the box instead you have text
printed on the box that tells you where
to find a link to the actual manual so
I'll be referencing that today because
no matter what experience level you are
as a builder when you're building in
something this limited for space you
really need to follow the right order of
operations so you don't screw yourself
midway through build and
having to you know uninstall certain
parts so we'll be following that I
suggest you guys do the same if you're
building in a century case or any case
this small for that matter alright let's
open the manual I took a look through
the manual just you know at a glance
before I started shooting it's just a
very a very thorough and detailed manual
which it kind of needs to be for a case
like this so thank God that it is it's
gonna make my life a whole lot easier so
step one is to disassemble the body so
that we can actually get inside you'll
need a Torx screw to do that and they've
included one in the package which is
nice because this case has Torx screws
for some reason as did the 1.1 version
from what I'm told
and I don't know why whatever at least
they give you this as well as a bunch of
included accessories like your riser
cable all the mounting screws the fancy
light a power button and so forth we'll
take a look at all that later so okay
looks like there's two screws here now
again I never built inside the 1.1 but I
did watch some reviews recently and a
lot of people were complaining that
there were way too many screws just to
just assemble the body there was like a
thousand screws and it took like 10
minutes to even get inside the chassis
which I agree is a total pain in the ass
so this is a much more elegant solution
that took all of 15 seconds if hey we're
inside alright so I'm gonna put this
aside for now nice nice premium quality
this is yeah like I don't even feel bad
doing that it's very solid we can oh oh
okay okay
he's already kind of loosey-goosey we
just need one screw here this is like
the the GPU bracket area a knee joint
one thing I noticed right off the bat
like the one point one no dust filters
still no dust filtration in this case
which is going to turn off a lot of
people I feel kind of conflicted about
it well I think I definitely preferred
dust filters be included I'm not going
to knock it too hard for it because it's
such a small case I feel like you just
take a data vac engine and just blow all
the air out within a couple seconds but
again I understand completely why this
might be a deal-breaker for some now
there are third-party dust filters that
you can buy separately that worked with
the one point one model which would also
work with 2.0 because again the size
hasn't changed and from what I've been
told a ventilation area sort of
orientation hasn't changed much either
so those should still be compatible if
you're still incorrect you know
screw trade because this can get messy
real quick okey-dokey artichokey I might
have mentioned that there's not a whole
lot different about the 2.0 model from
its predecessor but one edition that I
think is really worth noting is added
support for a hundred and twenty
millimeter AIO you can water cool in
this bad boy which is really impressive
considering just how small it is I think
it's like seven liter capacity or
something like that it's just so tiny
and cute but yeah adding water cooling
support is definitely gonna be a big
seller for a lot of people who are a fan
of the first one we will not be
installing an area today because I don't
have any that will actually fit either
the hoses are too thick they're like the
thicker tubes which is just not gonna
play nice in the case this small or the
radiators too thick I think the
clearance is it's 50 millimeters for
your radiator and your fan combined so
if you're using a standard 25 millimeter
thick fan you only have about 25
millimetres of radiator thickness that
you can fit in here and even then that's
that's really pushing it you're maxing
out clearance they're actually
suggesting that you go no more than 47
48 millimeters just to give that fan a
little bit of clearance for in taking
air and so forth okay so first rule of
order they want us to install the power
button the power button is not stree
installed you actually have to install
it yourself and it comes with this
really nice black and red braided cable
it is an LED power button as well so
you'll have to plug in your power LED
front panel connectors so you past the
front panel connector side the power
button is flush with the front slide on
the included oring first bring it all
the way up and then slide the screw on
and screw or dad power button East
installed that's it that's a nice
feeling power button hey make sure to
attach all required cables if you're
using a modular PSU before installing it
inside no yes you know it's a good
reminder let's install the power supply
of course this only takes sfx units no
sfx l units are allowed that is too long
we're using a FSP dagger 600 watt 80
plus gold certified sfx power supply and
it's don't bite us at least I might have
got a bad unit but this is very loud
I've actually built with it before
SuperDuper loud but again this is just
for demo purposes so I'm gonna face the
power supply fan upwards which is where
the ventilation area of the case will be
and then we got to screw it down so it
looks like there are only three mounting
screws for the power supply here which
for an SFX unit should be more than
enough
down on a ping badda-boom all right if
you installed now I'm gonna pop in the
motherboard IO shield because we already
can prep the mo boo we're gonna put the
case aside for now and focus on our as
rock a be 350 gaming ITX AC fatality
branded motherboard we also have a
rising 520 600 X 6 core 12 thread CPU
seems like it would be a pretty nice
chip for a system like this and I'm
gonna pop that in can you guys see that
okay good how Akula is the very low
profile crying c7 low profile because we
only have 47 millimeters of CPU high
clearance in this chassis not a whole
lot some work with I need some thermal
paste yeah my little guy here you go
wait this doesn't wait this isn't
letting up hold on hold on this I know
this is the old version of the c7 which
doesn't support socket am for great if
only there was a cooler just like this
one within arm's reach that would let me
continue this build without much hassle
come here you little bugger I love this
set it's so handy okay that works out
nicely I swear this isn't scripted I
just so happened to have another c7
right behind me on the set I'll be it
this is the full copper heatsink version
so that's cool and since its updated it
does support socket am four natively so
we can continue
we've got 2 8 gig sticks of Corsair
Vengeance lpx DVR for at 3,000 speed
these are low profile memory modules
which is recommended for this build and
I would say almost mandatory if you're
gonna be installing the liquid Aereo
because with the water cooling tubes in
there the tubes are actually gonna take
up the space where your cables
ordinarily would so your cables are
gonna have to go over your memory
modules and if you have too tall of heat
spreaders you might not be able to fit
them all so bear that in mind
you get pre-installed standoffs which is
a plus and I just noticed this the case
actually includes a set of Phillips head
screws with the same thread and size as
all the torque screws so you could just
use only Phillips head screws for the
whole build if you wanted to the only
difference being that they're silver as
opposed to nice and black like the Torx
screws I guess for the inside it doesn't
really matter unless you're picky about
that sort of thing which I kind of am
I'm just gonna keep using the black Torx
screws screw it all right easy now that
went in very nicely now it's worth
noting that we're using a two and a half
inch SSD for our only drive in the
system but if you happen to be using an
m2 drive and you want to mount that
behind your motherboard assuming that it
has a slot back there you want to do
that before mounting your motherboard
since this case does not have any cutout
behind the motherboard tray like the
internal frame of the fractal design no
202 does for example no since the back
of our power supply is recessed and it's
not flush with the outside of the case
we actually have to run pass-through
cable so we've got a pass-through cable
which is included you run it through
this little hole plug it into your power
supply right off the bat make sure the
switch is on because once the body's
assembled you won't be able to access
that and then you've also got this
yellow ground wire
safety first it needs to be bolted down
so the little threaded post just below
the motherboard once that's down you can
proceed to routing the rest of the cable
through and simply mount the AC socket
to the case with two screws alright so
now we get to install the PCI you riser
card and it comes in two pieces this guy
first pops in and then this fellow
connects like so and then we have a
riser bracket we need to mount and this
little purpose of this is to just
stabilize the riser card we just
installed so two screws for this guy
they just get mounted at the top okay
we're going to circle back to the riser
card in a moment but for now let's go
ahead and plug in our 24 pin ATX cable
for the motherboy
in our 8-pin eps connector holds a CPU
now we're gonna install the USB 3
pass-through cable that comes included
you've got to type a ports on one end
which means to the front of the case
using two screws and that of course
terminates to a 20 pen connector that
goes to your motherboard as you can see
I used some of the room in front of the
power supply the stash most of that USB
3.0 cable because there's quite a bit of
excess I'm gonna leave our 24 pin cable
a little loose for now because we still
have to install our SATA cable which is
gonna go to our single two and a half
inch SSD and I'm actually gonna wire up
the front panel connectors that are
coming off of our power button as well
now we're ready to install our SSD but
first we have to mount a little plate
with the SSD mounts to so comes included
this little guy right here just slots in
like so and you get one screw to hold it
in place
then you bring over your SSD and it kind
of just mounts right over that tray
partially mostly on top of your riser
card area and you just screw it in three
screws manual also says that you can
actually install a second two and a half
inch drive in this area if you're not
installing it here you alright SSDs good
just got a plug er in there it is
alright it's getting a little hairy over
here so give me a moment while I push
all these cables down you guys probably
already caught it a while back but this
is a very familiar experience to the
fractal design node 202 mainly because
the layouts are very similar that's not
a bad thing I really like the 202 of
course it's a little bit more compact
here not quite as much space now the
last piece to our puzzle is the graphics
card here we have a gtx 1070 from
gigabyte it's one of their mini cards
it's only six inches long which is not
generally impressive but it works well
in a case like this we also have a
fairly tall PCB which might pose an
issue we can actually fit I should
mention 305 millimeter long GPUs this is
much shorter than that so with the car
this size you can even get away with
fitting a three and a half inch
mechanical drive or that 120 millimeter
radiator in the same compartment that
goes in nice and easy ooh height
clearance just barely makes it it is
right on the edge there I'm actually
kind of concerned about our peg
connector oh it might just barely work
so it does look like the manuals saying
you get some clearance height wise for
an oversize GPU but it's not much you
get about 18 millimeters edition
hi over your standard reference PCB so
bear that in mind this is an advertised
mini GPU and it barely fits not because
of its length but because of how tall it
is final steps here with this little
bracket this goes in LAC so this is what
also mounts your GPU more securely you
know the other thing i just thought of
is that since you can't fit a 120
millimeter radiator here you could
probably just stick a 120 millimeter fan
in there if you wanted to I would think
that if it supports wanted support the
other and I would of course potentially
lower your thermal is even further but
we're going to test it as is for now
gotta finish mounting the bracket from
the front side the two more screws and
what do you know our interior assembly
is pretty much done awesome possum final
step is this guy so you can actually see
here there's sort of a raised area on
the inside of this the side panel that's
actually supposed to go up against your
graphics card I guess it just reinforces
it a little bit more reduces wobble by
bration that sort of thing am i doing
that strange goes down like that final
screw here we go alright
voila hey it's like it's like a pizza
box special delivery
alright so like I mentioned earlier you
can orient this one of two ways
horizontally which in that case you'll
need to add some of these adhesive feet
or some square feet here with adhesive
backing I believe that's for if you're
using an AI oh they want you to use the
square feet for AOS and the rounded feet
for air cooling vertically you get that
super sexy stand where is it let me get
the stand so I'm gonna put this upside
down for a minute stand goes up top here
snap those in tell it how its tool is
beautiful yeah I want to boot it can we
boot it
now we've been in doom for about 15 to
20 minutes actually a little bit more
than that now just to give the
components a chance to get heat soaked
and right now our 2600 X is overclocked
mind you to 4 gigahertz on all six cores
and the hottest it's getting the hottest
it's gotten in the last 24 seven minutes
is 73 C it's really not bad and I'm sure
that last-minute upgrade to an all
copper or firing c7 doesn't hurt any
either not to mention there's ample case
ventilation just above the cooler so it
gets healthy intake or GPU our gtx 1070
which is running bone stock right now is
hitting 77 c that's a couple degrees
below 80 which isn't bad for a gtx 1070
when you're talking about a case of this
size it's really not too bad the temps
are perfectly adequate in my book and
this is just one example of one
configuration that you could potentially
put inside of this case i wouldn't just
go drop in a 9900 cane here willy-nilly
you can get away with some pretty decent
performance though as we're seeing here
gonna have the frame rate counter up but
i'm sure we're getting well over 60 FPS
and that's just completely wasted that
chainsaw on that asshole i don't care
this is just for a video haha the build
process is very smooth again i would
equate it to something like a node 202
just in a tinier package i'd say the
quality here is a little bit higher than
that case as well because it's
completely metal i don't know if i
mentioned that but there's not a piece
of plastic on it it's really solid
through and through so there's really
not much room for cracking things like
that of course you are gonna pay a
premium two hundred and fifty dollars if
that's about where it's gonna land is a
wrap ton of money especially for a small
form-factor chassis you know if you
don't need the case to be ultra portable
then something like a note 202 is still
a fantastic option for a fraction of the
price really but if you're just looking
for the tiniest and most compact
enthusiast grade case out there there
aren't many better options i mean there
is the Dan case a 4 which is also around
$200 if I remember correctly fantastic
case also definitely a completely
different shape and layout
as this case but still something to look
into if that's the kind of Nietzsche
case you're looking for the century 2.0
is a one-of-a-kind case it's built like
a tank
super smart in design and it's a it's
definitely a looker but you guys let me
know what you think down in the comments
below would you pay 250 bucks for this
thing
is it sexy enough is it unique enough
for you to actually shell out that kind
of cash I don't know why I'm still
playing the video is over thank you very
much for watching this video if you
enjoyed it
toss a like on it before you go and get
subscribed for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon also when you think of
the new set new set yeah it looks pretty
good right I think I think I like it
more than less set it surprisingly right
now but yeah okay that's all for me guys
thanks for watching and have a good one
I will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
