more info what's up guys welcome back to
the manta bill blog I really need to
start thinking of a good name for this
PC because we are getting dangerously
close to being done with it in fact if
you guys have any name suggestions feel
free to leave them in the comments below
and I'll check them out but we're gonna
be doing a couple things today things
that I mentioned I would be doing in the
last build log so the first of which is
we're going to drain the system we're
going to drain the loop and replace the
Mayhem's or aurora shampoo stuff with
the aqua tuning UV reactive now of
course I could just drop some of these
UV reactive drops into this current dye
however I'm just not a huge fan as of
the shampoo stuff I think the shampoo
type Aurora fluid works really well with
with larger reservoirs where you can
really see the effect because it's kind
of lost when you go in the individual
tubes you don't really see it that much
so I'm going to be swapping that out and
then what's the other thing oh yes the
pump res here as we noted is a little
bit crooked it's a SAG in just a bit
actually doesn't look that bad right now
I feel like the little kickstand here
the little tube kickstand that I had
before kind of trained it a little bit
but it's probably going to sag back down
a little bit so what I'm going to do and
a lot of you guys made the suggestion
and brilliant super simple yet effective
is actually taking two washers which I
have right here I've painted
like with Sharpie taking two washers and
putting them underneath the bottom two
screws of this pump res bracket that's
mounting the pump res to that radiator
so I think that's just going to elevate
it just ever so slightly so that it's
then parallel with the GP water block
and I think that's going to look really
nice however I'm going to have to
uninstall pretty much all this stuff the
radiator in the pump res in order to
access that back screw right there cuz
right now with the the shitty shitty
allen wrench I just I can't I can't get
back there my fingers are too fat fat
finger problems so I'm gonna have to
undo all that it's gonna be a process
but I think it'll be worth it in the end
by the way look at these cables look at
these end sourced sleeved extensions
they are beautiful guys if you want some
some really nice work Joey does a
fantastic job over it and sourced with
with all of his hand sleeved stuff these
are all hand sleeved none of that like
factory and they just look
absolutely fantastic paracord sleeving
oh oh thanks Joey these things look sick
but the other thing that I was going to
do is oh yeah
install some of these UV strips because
there's already a UV strip in the build
but I think it could be just a little
bit more vibrant I think I could use a
bit more brightness in there and really
just show off the UV reactive stuff
including the fluid and the the flow
meter back there
so I'm going to be installing one of
these two this is I think this one might
be bad
I might have fried this one back in the
day I'm going to see if it works and the
last thing that I'm going to be doing
today is actually redoing this run right
yeah this run right yeah so the reason
why is because the angle of this tube
right here this part of the angle this
part of the run I would like it to be a
bit more parallel with this angle here
you see they're not quite matching this
this angle needs to come down just maybe
five ten degrees like - OOP and then
it'll be right parallel with that it'll
just look a little bit nicer in the end
I have two more tubes here two more the
60 millimeter tube so I have basically
two more attempts and if I F both of
those up then I'm probably going to
stick with this run for now until I get
some more tubing later but those are all
the things that I'm going to be doing
today in in this vlog and this build
logs so um like I said it's going to be
quite a process but I do think it's
gonna be worthwhile in the end and it
should be fun as well so let's get
started
and there she be Letty's oh yes it is
complete for the most part for now and
I'm liking it I'm loving it oh yeah
alright so let's go over the things that
I did first off the pump rez is now more
or less perfectly straight with the with
the GPU and like the rest of the case it
sits flat down no more sag no more sag
thank you to everyone all 50000 of you
who suggested to put the washers under
here it actually did make a great
difference however one thing I
overlooked is that by doing that it
changed the angle or change the the
height of this fitting ever so slightly
and so I actually had to trim this tube
because when I put it back into place it
was actually bent down down some so I
had to modify that just a bit I also did
modify the tube in the back there the
straight tube that goes from the
radiator to that splitter it was a
little bit long and so because the it
was a little long the splitter was off
to the left a little too much and this
fitting was kind of angled that way so I
shortened that tube in the back and now
that this tubing this this fitting can
go straight back there so that's nice
and this Bend right here
I didn't redo the whole thing I just
ended up using the same Bend but just
warming up this joint here this this one
turn and and just kind of like you know
just just adjusted it to get that same
angle as the tube down here so now you
can see both runs are more or less
parallel to each other I mean I'm sure
if you got out the protractor it
wouldn't be exact but it's good enough
for the naked eye I suppose
and also this fluid this new fluid
actually looks way better in here than I
thought it would seriously I did not
expect it to look this good it actually
matches the thus leaving the blue the
blue accents on the sleeving a lot
closer than I thought it would because I
don't know the fluid just looks darker
in the bottle for some reason maybe it's
kind of plastic or it's just a bigger
mass I have no idea but it looks a bit
lighter when in the system when in this
loop so I'm really happy with how that
turned out I also dropped in about 20
drops of that UV reactive mayhem stuff
it says on the bottle to drop one drop
at a time and then check to see if
you're satisfied I was like screw that
dropping in 20 at once Yolo
I'm really happy with the results
actually let's go ahead and turn it on
see what it looks like boom baye baye
yes you can see is just a lot more glowy
this time around than it was in the last
bill blog and that's exactly the effect
I was trying to go for the second UV
strip here free cable mod definitely
helps a lot oh yeah let me let me turn
the lights off let me turn the lights
boom
does that look crazy or what super nuts
yeah maybe this will give you guys some
ideas on a name just just how frickin
electric it looks and blue I mean this
fluid combo is just frickin deadly I
mean it was already pretty cool with
just the aqua tuning stuff but then the
Mayhem's UV drops just takes it over the
edge I'm really loving how it all just
complements with those those ridiculous
new Ram heat spreaders amazeballs but
that is pretty much gonna wrap it up for
now guys I'm gonna call this build
complete I don't know if I already
mentioned that but yeah I'm pretty much
don't I don't know what else to do with
it if you guys have any ideas let me
know be sure to LIKE the video if you
enjoyed it also just let me know what
you think of the system so far and feel
free to subscribe to the channel for
more tech stuff coming at you really
soon have a goin guys i'll see you all
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
