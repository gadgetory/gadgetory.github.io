letting up anytime soon I mean if
anything it keeps expanding and
manufacturers like NZXT seem to be
riding shotgun in this bandwagon
especially when we see them launch brand
new product lines like their q2 lighting
system building on the hugely successful
hue plus q2 essentially serves the same
purpose of blinging out your system but
adds support for second gen devices and
extends the invitation to the RGB party
to your monitor you hear that you're
finally invited it's gonna be lit just
remember BYO RGB tough crowd
speed up your rig with the Toshiba OC
ZTR 200 SSD experience ultra fast
performance packaged in a slim
two-and-a-half inch form factor using
sixty-four layer 3d NAND flash memory
now available in 240 480 and 960 gig
capacities click on the link below for
more info
now while Q 2 is controlled by n ZX T's
cam software and functions in much the
same way as the hue plus there's quite a
few new products and accessories here so
it can get kind of tricky figuring out
which devices are sold separately and
how they all come together so let's
break it down
there's the hue to RGB lighting kit with
an MSRP of $74.99 US this replaces the
hue plus and like its predecessor
includes a lighting controller hub and
for 300 millimeter addressable RGB LED
strips each strip has magnets and 3m
adhesive for flexible mounting options
and the controller features four
separate channels that support up to 6
accessories and 40 LEDs each since cam
can auto detect you 2 accessories you
can also mix and match them on any
channel to suit your needs and while
first gen a or RGB fans and hue plus LED
strips are supported they do require
their own channel and cannot be mixed
with you 2 accessories such as the kits
included LED strips it's worth noting
that these two are 2nd gen products and
are not compatible with the original hue
plus controller the hub retains its 2
and a half inch form factor but sports a
thinner profile than the hue plus making
it much easier to stick behind your
motherboard via an SSD tray the included
velcro strips or my favorite the
built-in magnets it kind of bummed me
out to see that the new hue still gets
its power through that stubborn molex
connector instead
Ceyda hardly anything I use requires
molex these days so it sucks having to
bust out an extra PSU cable rather than
being able to piggyback off an existing
SATA cable with a free plug next to the
hub's power connector is a micro USB
port for connecting itself to the
motherboards USB 2.0 header which allows
it to communicate with cam on the same
side you'll find the first two channel
ports and the second two on the left one
advantage that the hue plus had of only
having one pair of Channel ports was
being able to fit all of its connections
on one side of the unit which made for
much cleaner cable management
comparatively users who plan on mounting
the hue to on the glamour side of their
rig may have to try harder to route the
cables as tidally when using all four
channel ports the hue 2 strips are super
bright and rich in color just like the
first gen strips making it really hard
to tell them apart
this kit alone provides more than enough
bling to an otherwise dull system but
there are still three new accessories
for users who demand even more
illumination for their PC if the
lighting kits for included LED strips
just aren't enough you can pick up the
hue 2 LED strip accessory which is sold
separately for an MSRP of $24.99 this
simple kit includes two of the same 300
millimetre addressable RGB LED strips
and the proper cables for getting them
connected the second accessory is much
more interesting and the first of its
kind for the hue line for $29.99 the hue
to cable comb accessory is a set of
addressable RGB cable combs which really
shouldn't surprise us at this point in
the box you get to 24 pin and 5/8 pin
cones that are all daisy chained by a
single cable which terminates to a 4 pin
5 volt RGB plug this connects to one of
the 4 channels on the hue plus lighting
hub and is therefore controlled by cam
like everything else the combs are made
of a hard semi opaque plastic so light
can shine through them and it's
important to note that they will only
fit well with 3 millimeter cable sets
which was pretty limiting in my
experience trying to use the combs with
cable mods Pro Series up here cables and
thermal takes tt Mod extensions proved
could be a royal struggle those with
enough patience and finger strength
might be able to brute force fatter
wires into these combs but they may end
up bending their cables out of shape in
the process I was also kind of surprised
by the lack of any six pin trainers
maybe NZXT teased logic here is that a
builder who's spending $30 on cable
combs probably
has a top-shelf video card with higher
power requirements anyway still it just
seems kind of odd to have no six pin
support at all I'm sure you could use an
eight pin comb with your six pin cable
if you're okay with your rig looking
like hot garbage I'm sad to report that
the engineering sample I received had
some weak connections keeping the LEDs
from turning on so I wasn't able to see
them in action we'll just have to take
NZXT at their word that they do in fact
light up the third new accessory for
showboating your rig and style is the
under glow kits priced at 3499 for ATX
cases and five bucks less for smaller
cases this is an external add-on for
creating an under glow effect included
are a pair of 300 millimeter rigid
addressable RGB LED strips that mount to
the underside of your chassis with the
provided 3m adhesive the strip's had a
hard time sticking to the bottom of my
s340 elite though because the only area
you can reasonably mount them to have a
few rivets in the way that the adhesive
just isn't strong enough to grip having
magnets built into the strip's could
have been a huge help here the strips
are linked together by a short cable and
can be plugged in either directly to the
hew 2 controller or externally to the
included PCI expansion bracket
installation is quick and easy if you
have a fully smooth surface to work with
of course and the two adhesive cable tie
downs keep the wiring orderly like the
internal strips you get the same bright
LEDs with smooth transitions and radiant
color beaming down onto your desk now
the last youtube part in this family is
not an accessory but rather a full
functioning product in fact imagine it
to be almost exactly like the hue to
lighting kit but instead of serving your
PC it serves the back of your monitor
the hue to ambient RGB lighting kit cost
the most coin of the bunch at $100 and
comes in two models one suited for
panels 21 to 26 inches and another for
larger displays up to 35 inches the
larger kit you see here features a
familiar lighting hub with just two
channels and eight LED strips four of
which span 300 millimeters while the
other four runs slightly shorter at 250
millimeters once again users have the
choice of magnetic or adhesive backing
for the strips but are limited to using
the included velcro pieces when mounting
the hub behind the monitor now while I
was able to get everything mounted to my
curved 2 PG 3 4 8 Q ultra wide display
you'll want to
make sure there aren't any buttons or
other obstacles behind your panel that
might prevent you from running strips in
the proper locations just a few hours
after installation the 3m adhesive on
the strip's was already losing its grip
so I had to secure them with painters
tape which is kind of cringe for the
price you're paying here also provided
as an AC adapter with a quadruplet of
regional plugs cable ties and cables for
connecting the strips and wiring them to
the hub and a microUSB to type a cable
for connecting the hub to your PC
preferably to your rear i/o through can
the ambient lighting kit can dance to
all the same lighting effects as the
internal hue lighting kit with an extra
trick up its sleeve ambient mode
dynamically matches the LEDs to the
colors on your screen creating a more
unique and immersive gaming experience
it's a cool little cherry on top that
works very well in practice it's also
worth noting that multi monitor users
can connect additional ambient lighting
kits NZXT recommends their extended mode
when using more than one display this
requires one kit per monitor and when
ambient mode is enabled colors will only
be pulled from the primary monitor as
you would expect users can also sync up
lighting effects between their PC and
display to achieve luminous RGB harmony
some of the things up here the hue tube
could definitely have better mounting
solutions in several areas it's got its
own set of quirks and oddities that you
just have to deal with and the privilege
of ownership does not come cheap but it
is by a landslide the most advanced and
customizable lighting ecosystem for your
setup currently on the market and I
would recommend it to anyone looking for
a serious boost in the bling department
