what's up guys today I'm taking a look
at one of the largest and most powerful
laptops you can get your hands on
assuming your hands are big enough this
is the gt80 titan sli from msi which
targets a very specific niche of gamer
looking for uncompromised performance in
the form of a portable laptop and I'll
touch on that later but jumping right in
msi offers this behemoth in several
different hardware configurations at
varying price points the one I have here
is rocking a core i7 4720 hq2
gtx 970m GPUs in sli each of them packin
a 6 big frame buffer 16 gigs of ram at
1600 megahertz to 128 gig m2 SATA SSDs
in raid 0 and a 1 terabyte hard drive in
case you thought that these jaw-dropping
specs and a steep price of about $2,800
indicate that this's MSI's flagship
offering think again because they have a
model with even better hardware in just
about every area that goes for a
whopping $3,700 we don't worry if you
feel like a peasant for having a sub
$3,000 laptop that already outperforms
most people's desktops the gt80 titan
sli allows for easy expansion and
upgrade ability options for your storage
memory and even GPUs that's right
an attractive proprietary design lets
you swap out your existing GPUs for even
better ones
although these exclusive modules will
cost you a sizable premium the rush
you'll get from spending so much money
at once will be priceless in the off
chance that you're not already hell-bent
on pulling the trigger on one of these
bad boys
the included mousepad wrist rest and
metal key caps will certainly turn you
around because nothing says worth it
like commonplace accessories still not
convinced
a massive complimentary backpack lets
you travel freely with the laptop and
comes with a free voucher for a
chiropractor of your choice alright
alright
I think I've given MSI a hard enough
time for one video but the fact of the
matter is is this laptop is just so over
the top that it's almost comical and I
just couldn't help it poke fun at it a
little so now that I got it all out of
my system let's talk about the rest of
the laptop starting with the portability
factor which there is none at 18 inches
long by 13 inches deep by 2 inches thick
approximately you'd be hard-pressed to
use this 10-pound machine without ample
desk space an off-putting stipulation
for those in need of a reasonably
portable gaming solution fortunately the
Titans gargantuan footprint isn't
completely without purpose from first
glance you probably noticed the Titan
lacks a conventional chiclet style
keyboard instead MSI has teamed up with
SteelSeries to integrate a full Cherry
MX keyboard with brown switches into the
laptop in industry first this isn't just
some kind of watered-down version of a
mecha board either it types and feels
just like any other and you get those
familiar cross shaped switches so you
can easily swap out the key caps for
third-party alternatives if you're
looking to do some customization the red
LED backlit keys can be disabled or set
to three varying levels of brightness
though some users might find even the
dimmest setting a bit excessive in
low-light environments to the right of
the keyboard is a touchpad which can be
a bit awkward to use due to its narrow
profile and the physical left and right
click buttons feel a bit on the cheap
side interestingly enough the touchpad
also doubles as a 10 key numpad which
works surprisingly well however the two
functions can't be used simultaneously
which makes heavy number crunching
impractical without having a connected
Mouse just above the touchpad you get a
few different buttons that do a few
different things aside from good old
power the GPU button allows you to
switch between the laptops discreet and
integrated GPU whether you're trying to
increase gaming performance or minimize
power consumption the last button boosts
the RPM of your laptop fans for those
hot and heavy gaming sessions though I'd
only recommend using this feature when
at the airport as nearby jet engines are
the only sure way to drown out the sound
of the overbearing fans at the top of
the base you'll find Dynaudio premium
speakers which are driven by a creative
Sound Blaster cinema - sound chip
there's also a bottom mounted subwoofer
which we'll see in a moment while these
speakers are capable of getting
freakishly loud they sound about the
same as any other high-end laptop
speakers with notice
tininess despite the bottom subwoofer at
the north end of the laptop you get a
1080p webcam that stands above an
eighteen point four inch 1920 by 1080
display wait what hold on a sec so this
laptop has enough horsepower to
potentially drive games at 4k yet it has
a screen that has the same resolution as
my thousand-dollar laptop sporting a
single 860m I I'm having a hard time
wrapping my head around this one because
it seems to me that the stellar
performance of these two GPUs is now
partially wasted on a mainstream
resolution with an SLI configuration and
a combined 12 gig frame buffer I'm
pretty surprised and admittedly
disappointed at the screens lower pixel
density you would think that since MSI
is hailing the GT 84 having a desktop
like upgrade path that they would have
given gamers more incentive to actually
upgrade the ability to play at
resolutions beyond 1080 being a big one
for most of course lower pixel density
means lower power consumption and
increased battery life but seeing as how
this laptop is more of a desktop
replacement than an on-the-go device
chances are most users will have the
laptop plugged into a power source
anyway so the rationale behind this
imbalanced hardware configuration is
beyond me but not to dwell on the
subject too much
on the left side of the Titan you get
mic and headphone jacks an optical
s/pdif out 3 USB 3 ports an SD card
reader blu-ray player Kensington lock
and side ventilation that's replicated
on the right where you also get two
additional USB 3 ports on the back is
more ventilation at both ends 2 mini
display ports an HDMI 1.4 a killer e 20
200 Gigabit Ethernet LAN port and a DC
plug for the biggest power brick you've
ever seen in your life at the front are
three LED indicators for Wi-Fi battery
life and hard drive activity and finally
on the bottom is that Dynaudio subwoofer
and six slightly elevated rubber feet to
allow for healthy exhaust from the
bottom ventilation slots in addition to
hardware the Titan comes with Windows
8.1 pre-installed and more pre-loaded
software than I'd like to see naturally
where this laptop really shines is with
raw gaming performance so here in GTA 5
we saw an average frame rate of 54 at
very high settings with MSAA disabled
while there's still not quite enough GPU
processing power here to max out all GTA
5's little in-game settings you can
still get a great looking image that
runs buttery
similar performance was seen in evolve
with an average of 51 FPS but this time
around I was able to run at max settings
without a hitch
considering the game's large open maps
and abundant wildlife textures this was
especially nice to see the synthetic
benchmark in Bioshock Infinite's scored
a satisfying 119 frames per second on
average with diffusion enabled I even
jumped into the actual game to verify
that the numbers were accurate and yes
yes they were and last of the runs was
battlefield 4 which saw 101 frames per
second on Ultra it's probably no
surprise to say that this is the fastest
laptop I've had the privilege of working
with and it should be able to shoot
through pretty much any game you throw
at it for years to come
so perhaps by now as we draw near to the
end of this review we can begin to
imagine what type of gamer would be
interested in the gt80 titan sli for one
whoever's buying this laptop is living
quite comfortably as the money spent on
one of these things is enough to feed a
small third-world country to the ideal
candidate demands the absolute best
gaming performance available in a laptop
period 3 for reasons unbeknownst to URI
the ideal customer lives a lifestyle
where a conventional desktop PC is
impractical maybe they travel a lot so
much to the point where they're in and
out of hotel rooms more than their
actual home he or she would also have to
be ok with not using this device on a
plane train or anywhere else with
limited desk space unless of course they
own a private jet or something and for
the gamer in question doesn't mind
looking 10 plus pounds of weight around
everywhere they go especially if they
have some sort of roadie crew to do the
heavy lifting so if we use these four
elements to theorize the most likely
person in the world to buy this laptop
the results would probably spit out a
picture of American actor and director
Vin Diesel while the majority of us all
just outside of that demographic
catering to the social elite could very
well be exactly what msi was going for
after all the gt80 titan s allied does
pack some extravagant features that put
it in a league of its own even if that
league happens to be absolutely
ridiculous laptop in the comments below
