channel hope you're doing well today we
are finally taking a look at the gaming
benchmarks for our AMD risin AP use
we've got the rise in 320 200 G for core
4 thread part and the horizon 520 400 G
for core 8 thread parts both of which we
unboxed last week you guys probably
caught that and here we are going to
test the gaming performance so very
exciting stuff now obviously I could
test the risin 5 and 3 chips
independently but I'm sure there are a
lot of reviewers on YouTube and
elsewhere that are already already gonna
do that so if you guys want I'll put
some links in the description below
where you can check those guys out and
show them some love tell'em essentia but
today what I'm going to do is actually
test the Rison 520 400 G against the
Rison 3 paired with a GT 1030 the reason
for that being these two components are
pretty much about the same price as a
single Rison 520 400 G maybe 1015
dollars more expensive depending on
where you look but both of these could
be a viable option if you're looking for
a low-power gaming solution especially
with GPU prices where they are right now
so that's what we're gonna take a look
at today can the can the integrated
graphics on the Rison 520 400 G beat out
or at least match a GT 1030 which is of
course a discrete card it'll be
interesting to find out you can see I've
actually got our test bench right here
in front of me which also goes to show
just how small you can get these apu
systems down to we've got to of course
our rise in AP use at the center of it
all being cooled by the included Wraith
spire and that is on top of an AV 350 n
gaming Wi-Fi motherboard from gigabyte
fantastic little mini ITX board we've
got 16 gigs of g.skill ripjaws 5 ddr4 at
3200 megahertz i was able to get that
rated speed on both of our hardware
configurations here so that was
fantastic had to do that with was able
to do that with very minimal effort and
we've also got our boot drive and all of
our games loaded onto an ADATA SX 900
SSD that's a 512 gigabyte model and that
is all being powered by an SFX unit from
Corsair they're 450 watt power supply
right there so altogether a very lovely
little testbed we're using all the
latest drivers and and the BIOS updates
from AMD themselves these are all the
pre-release drivers and updates that
they gave us
viewers just before launch that being
said you should also bear in mind that
the drivers for the GT 1030 particularly
are much more optimized at this point I
mean this card's been out for a while
now so this definitely has more of a
softwear advantage compared to these new
ap use but rest assured and I've reached
out to AMD about this is that as time
goes on as always they're gonna be
releasing new BIOS updates and drivers
and things like that to continue
optimizing and improving upon the
performance and stability of these chips
so that's great news so bear that in
mind as we go into our testing here I'm
also using the latest updates for
Windows which is 1709 at the time of
filming and of course the latest wickel
drivers were used for the GT 1030 here
I'd also like to point out that most of
the games that we're testing today were
run at 1920 by 1080 there were a couple
that just maxed out the vram for our APU
here so we had to bump that down to 1280
by 720 those will be indicated or that
will be indicated on the benchmarks
slide so you know which ones were tested
at which resolutions that being said
ladies and gentlemen let's get onto the
benchmarks themselves and test out these
two hardware configurations to see which
one reigned supreme
alright so there you guys have it some
pretty interesting results for starters
I have to hand it to AMD they have made
one hell of an APU I mean this pretty
much blows every integrated graphic
solution that Intel's ever thrown at us
out of the water
hands down at the same time I was
experiencing as you guys could probably
tell from the graphs some frame time
issues with our APU here particularly
the horizon 520 400g when it was using
the integrated Vega graphics there were
some frame time spikes in a few of the
games that that that are a little bit
concerning especially games like you
know counter-strike and rocket League
which are very easy to run we're still
experiencing a little bit of stuttering
here and there which made the overall
experience in those particular titles
slightly less than ideal which makes it
hard to recommend over this setup at the
moment because the GT 1030 was pretty
smooth sailin I mean there was hardly
any stuttering maybe in one of the games
that we saw but for the most part the
overall experience was smoother on the
GT 1030 paired with the Rison 320 200 G
of course going back to what I said at
the beginning of the video these are
very early and premature drivers that
we're gonna have to wait a while for AMD
to iterate or maybe we won't have to
wait too long it could be in a week or
so that they release a new BIOS update
or a GPU driver that fixes some of these
stuttering issues that I'm encountering
today also I should for the records say
that go watch other people's reviews
because they might not have experienced
the same sort of artifacts or issues or
stuttering that I'm seeing here so it's
always good to sort of spread out who
you're watching and and checking you
double check your reviews now that being
said once AMD irons out any issues with
stuttering assuming that there are
stuttering issues that go beyond just my
own testing this becomes an incredibly
good value at 169 US dollars this thing
is very capable I mean it pretty much
holds a candle to the GT 1030 which is a
discrete GPU and it's gonna make a
fantastic stopgap temporary gaming rig
solution for those of you who can't
afford to pay an outrageous amount for a
new GPU so if you're waiting for the
prices to drop down this is definitely a
decent option not to mention it's gonna
be great for eSports games like I would
imagine dota 2 and League
legends even though I didn't test those
today the fact that it's performing very
well in average frame rates for games
like counter-strike and at rocket league
is it shows great promise
now speaking realistically there's only
so much an APU can do with its
integrated graphics solution so you're
pretty much gonna have to compromise
with console like graphics for the most
part until you get a discrete GPU in
there but at the same time there are so
many other features about PC gaming that
you can still enjoy with an APU for
example PC exclusive titles or how about
an uncapped framerate having access to
in-game quality settings and really the
list goes on keyboard and mouse
integration and so forth so overall this
thing is friggin awesome and the fact
that it's mostly keeping pace with the
GT 1030 is absolutely fantastic but bear
in mind since you don't have a discrete
GPU you're getting less power you're
drawing less power which is generating
less heat which requires a less beefy
cooling solution and in turn is gonna
equate to less noise if you don't
actually need active cooling part from
the CPU cooler itself which most systems
generally need so overall I'm very happy
with this chip you guys let me know what
you think the only question I that I
haven't answered yet is does it scratch
your overclocking itch which is of
course a question we'll have to answer
in a later video but guys if you enjoyed
this video or first off let me know what
you think of these ap use what you think
of the results so far and and again like
I said go ahead and watch other
reviewers and check out their results as
well let me know what you think in the
comments guys I'm always curious to hear
your thoughts
toss a like on the video if you enjoyed
it you can also check out more of my
content on floatplane if you want to
watch it up to a week early without ads
I'll put a link for that in the video
description till next time guys thanks
for watching and I'll see y'all in the
next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
