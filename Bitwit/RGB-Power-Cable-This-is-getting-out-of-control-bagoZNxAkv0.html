everything and this is the first time
I've ever unboxed a product that was
sent to me by one of you yes a fan sent
this in can't remember his name or even
if there was a name attached to it the
first place but I unbox this already on
awesome hardware during a segment of
mail time and I took it out the box
showed it to you guys and put it back in
the box haven't touched it since but
it's sort of a unique product that's
sure to generate some level of
discussion so I figured I would give it
a closer look today it's from or it was
purchased from the folks at addicted PC
dot-com from what I can tell they're a
smaller company that manufactures RGB
power cables now I initially decided
against making this video I tried really
hard to not make it but after seeing how
well the lien lease trimmer 24-pin RGB
cable video did do nifer the views
alright might as well crumpled up my
integrity and throw it into an RGB
bucket the pc3 7x gaming headset from
mass drop and sennheiser brings you into
the game with an open back design
featuring angled drivers for pinpoint
locational accuracy be heard clearly
through the fold-down noise cancelling
mic and enjoy the long-lasting comfort
of large plush velvet ear pads now
available in an all matte black finish
so the headset looks as good as it
sounds for more info click the link in
the description and catch the drop
before it's gone now the price that's
listed on the website for this cable is
40 US dollars $40 for an AC cable that
lights up I would have to imagine that
this is really aimed at enthusiasts who
are looking for every last bit of flair
for their custom PC a nice finishing
touch if you are really investing that
amount of money into your build so that
in mind let's take a look at this niche
product starting with the cable itself
measures about 5 feet long I would
describe the cable itself as being thick
for lack of a better term the cables got
a really wide gauge to it that doesn't
really kink it feels super rugged and
durable and it's got a really nice white
sleeping on it that seems fairly high
quality from what I can tell there's no
fraying you get some really beefy heat
shrink on either end and the cable
terminates to a standard male and female
plug however I believe the RGB lighting
only exists
in the female plug housing whereas this
end just doesn't light up but it plugs
into the wall so I guess that's okay you
won't be able to see it much anyway then
again how many people can say that if
they plug this into the back of their
system right now they'd be able to see
it anyway I don't know
it's an RGB cable I'm not gonna ask
questions and then stemming from the
heat shrink on the female side you get a
four pin 12 volt connector that you
would connect to the RGB header on your
RGB supported motherboard which would
give the RGB element inside this housing
its power and illumination of course
that would have me believe that you
could customize the lighting with your
motherboard manufacturers software like
asus or a sink or msi mystic light as
far as accessories go it's pretty barren
there's no documentation no instruction
manual however you do get a couple
little accessories including a four pin
12 volt extension cable that measures
about six to eight inches long and an
expansion cover with a couple cutouts
you can route your RGB cable from the
back ear case to the inside of your case
and then connect it to the RGB header on
your motherboard but enough talking
about this silly RGB products Kile plug
it in and let me see what it looks like
ok you win well would you look at that
completely lit the LEDs are actually
pretty bright even in a well-lit room
they're very easy to see right now it's
just kind of going through a color cycle
between seven or eight different colors
or you know sixteen point eight million
I guess if you if you want to be
marketing but it looks really nice it
looks really nice you know I don't know
if it looks $40.00 nice you guys let me
know what you think of that I'd say the
only eyesore is our fourth and 12 volt
cable that just kind of seems to be
hanging out here bye-bye the plug
you could probably zip tie it down find
a way to make it look a bit more
graceful but it is kind of just
free-balling it in the meantime
now I tried to install a essaouira on
this system cuz reason asus motherboard
and it is it's not working
casus makes some of the best
motherboards and graphics cards in the
world and yet they're freaking RGB app
doesn't work half the time I don't know
what's up with it so I can't actually
test it firsthand but I did verify on
the addicted PC website that this will
work with your motherboard software it
doesn't say which ones doesn't list
specific ones but it makes sense that if
you're plugging it into an RGB header on
your board that the appropriate software
will be able to change the color that's
going to that particular header so
that's it that's the RG
power cord from dicted PC I think the
question we set out to answer at the
beginning of this video was why and the
only answer I can really come up with is
why not
if you guys have any better answers than
that go ahead and leave them in the
comments I'd love to hear all about it
but until next time thank you so much
for watching this video toss a like on
it if you enjoyed it sorry this was an
RGB cable video guys I'm still pretty
jet-lagged as I mentioned but more
content on the way so get subscribe to
the channel so you don't miss any of
that you can also check me out on
floatplane if you want to catch all my
videos a week early without ads for
three bucks a month I'll put a link for
that in the video description till next
time guys thank you for watching have
yourselves a good one and I'll see y'all
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
