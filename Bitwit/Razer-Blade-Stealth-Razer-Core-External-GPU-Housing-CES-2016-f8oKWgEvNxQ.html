2016 is brought to you by need for seat
go to need for seat USA com for the
ultimate gaming chair experience for
your desk in office and the Corsair they
make good products and you should buy
them what's up guys so as I roll up to
the razor booth today at CES I realized
that my audio recorder was completely
broken for some odd reason so I shot all
the b-roll there went back to my Airbnb
rental and had to record the voice-over
separately which is what you're hearing
now but I'm still going to tell you a
little bit about their new blade stealth
now this is available now you can buy it
anytime starting for around a thousand
dollars it's a super thin ultrabook at
just point 5 2 inches thick really nice
and sleek it uses a 12.5 inch IGZO
display with capacitive multi-touch now
IGZO is pretty much I going to go
neck-and-neck with IPS in terms of
display quality it's going to be
featured in either quad HD or ultra HD
resolutions depending on which one you
get you either get seventy percent or a
hundred percent adobe RGB respectively
between those two models it's going to
rock in a core i7 6500 you dual core
processor with intel HD graphics of
course however you can add on a full
fledge desktop GPU to the Ultrabook
using their razor core which pricing
availability is still TBD well what it
essentially is an external GPU enclosure
that allows you to install like I said
two PCIe desktop graphics card and
connect it to the stealth via
Thunderbolt 3 which is essentially in
the form of us bc and that's essentially
going to give you a desktop gaming
experience on this little ultrabook so
there's no reboot required when plugging
the core into the stealth which is
really nice man since the court requires
AC power itself it can also power that
ultrabook through the Thunderbolt
connection so you get less cable clutter
all around that's all I really want to
share for you guys in this video be sure
