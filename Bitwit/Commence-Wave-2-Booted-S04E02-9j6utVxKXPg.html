one I think it should be working now
there was just a setting that had been
turned off the microphone input was not
set properly in xsplit but hopefully now
you can hear me I'm seeing little bars
now that that indicate indicate that
something some feed is coming through
some microphone goodness so hopefully
you hear my beautiful voice and we can
carry on with this show
sorry about that y'all sorry it's better
than how awesome hardware we're we're
we're late anyway and we have technical
difficulties but yay okay works awesome
alright on the show what I was saying
earlier is that I hate all of you and
you should all know I'm just kidding I
would never say that but actually I was
just wrapping up my my little recap on
the Nvidia editors day that Paul and I
were just at along with like Jay from
Jay's two cents and and Luke from Linus
tech tips a bunch of other guys too we
were in Austin for for all that good
stuff NVIDIA dropped a lot of knowledge
on our minds and it was really
interesting stuff thank you very much
Abin dollars for the donation I can tell
you I was just about to you preempted me
bro I was just about to tell you guys
about the GTX 1080 which I actually have
right here in this books here isn't it
beautiful
well actually you can't see it quite yet
but I can show it to you I guess I'll do
a little quick unboxing since since you
know since I love you guys and as an
apology for the audio slip-up at the
beginning here is just a look a brief
look I'm not gonna go ahead and tell you
any details about it if you guys want to
see here some specs on this thing go
check out my vlog that I just posted at
the very end of that video I talked all
about the specs of this guy benchmarks
are still under embargo so unfortunately
I can't give you any of those until
later this month hopefully but this is a
very fascinating card it's very exciting
the latest and greatest flagship from
Nvidia I guess I will take it out of the
packaging
or else you guys will riot I'm sure and
it is a little stuck on the whole snag
they're being very careful not to not to
not to ruin its or to to scuff it up or
anything but here it is guys here's the
batmobile card in in the flesh
it is it looks it looks a lot nicer in
person I think than in the pictures and
of course there's still some plastic
wrap on this its plastic piece here so
it looks a little bit more glossy than
it really is but I will hopefully be
able to share some very exciting
information on this card with you guys
in the very near future so stay tuned
for that and look at that single single
8 pin connector right there single a pin
connect there 180 watt TDP on this guy
and supposed to be double the
performance of gtx 980 in sli and to a
sli so that's exciting stuff so that's
yeah do not raid my house people in chat
that will be bad for the show or might
be the best thing that's ever happened
on the show who knows so yes there's
very exciting stuff that I'm gonna be
sharing with you guys soon so stay tuned
for that but on with it also let me know
what you guys want to see about it you
know drop me a comment cuz I'm gonna
miss the chat but drop me an actual
comment on this video when you can and
let me know what are you most interested
to find out about the new the new card
of course I'm gonna try to go into as
much detail as I can but it always helps
to have some guidance from you guys so
yes let's let's talk about but--at shall
we
this is episode 2 of season 4 where this
this marks our halfway point essentially
after the show is over our halfway point
through the season and it's exciting
because this is our second wave of
contestants this is the high end season
the second consecutive high in season
two booted actually and I am gonna tell
you guys what the next season of butit's
theme is going to be and that is custom
water cooling now do not submit your
entries just yet I'm just letting you
know that the theme is going to be
custom water cooled builds there's not
gonna be any price limit or any kind of
value limit it could be a thousand
dollar system it could be a five
thousand dollar system it just has to
feature custom water cooling to some
degree now the submission period is not
open I repeat do not submit a custom
water-cooled anything
- booted - my email right now because
the submission periods gonna open up at
a later date that's I haven't decided
when that's going to be yet I don't
wanna make any promises but I'm just
letting you guys know that the theme for
next month or not next month but two
months from now is going to be custom
water-cooled if you guys missed the
announcement on last week's episode of
booted I'm not going to be doing a
season in in June so next month there's
not going to be any any booted that's
simply because I'm gonna be pretty
preoccupied in in Taipei Taiwan for
Computex
of this year I'm gonna be headed there
with Paul and stuff he's gonna be busy -
we're gonna be shooting each other so
there isn't gonna be a season of booted
next month but the following season in
July or the following month in July
there will be a custom water cooled
season and it should be glorious so stay
tuned for more details on how to enter
or submit your pcs to that if you do
qualify but yeah very exciting stuff why
don't we go ahead and just give a brief
shout-out to our sponsor here - two
seasons consecutively is cable mod they
have been a proud sponsor of booted
since last month and they they love they
love the show so much they signed on
again fools fools all of them no I'm
just kidding
but look at this this is their cable mod
configurator and I've talked about this
quite extensively in previous episodes
but this is this is new this is
something a little bit different it's in
in addition that cable mod has thrown
onto their configurator website that
wasn't here the last time I talked about
it and that's this this is the custom
extensions right here before you had
custom PSU cables so you could actually
choose your brand of power supply to get
fully sleeved cables that go straight
from the unit itself depending on your
model they've got all kinds of things
you know Corsair EVGA be quiet and so
forth and that's really nice but since
then they've also added the option for
custom extensions so if you wanted to do
some shorter extensions still keep these
stock cables that come with your power
supply and just simply have some
extensions to go with it then you can do
that as well with the paracord sleeving
very high quality stuff everything else
from this point on is pretty much the
same as I've shown you in the past
you've got the option for 24 pin 8 pin
or 6 pin PCI II or or a VPS of course
for your CPU we're gonna go ahead and do
a quick example of
24-pin here and you can see it's 24
bucks for one of these sleeves for the
24 pin which i think is very reasonable
considering the amount of time and
energy that it takes to custom sleeve
your cables if you've never done it in
the past it is quite tedious unless
you've done it a lot unless you have a
lot of practice and you can just plow
right through it it took me forever to
do mine for for hotline for example so
here you go there's here's a little
diagram and you can basically select any
color you want I'm gonna do light blue
and then you can just go ahead and click
on whichever cable you want to be that
color and it's uh it's that simple guys
it's really that simple so you know you
can do whatever you want you can do a
I'm gonna do it I guess I'm doing it
apparently a red white and blue theme
here you know go in team america fuck
yeah sort of thing but you can do pretty
much pretty much whatever your heart
desires and it's it's pretty awesome so
once you're once you're cool with that
you can continue to the next step
they've got a bunch of options here you
know if you want some cable combs or
SATA cables things like that they also
have their wide beam LED strips which
are very good thank you very much a
Barrett for the donation do you
appreciate that sir did I meet deadmau5
no I really want to meet deadmau5 for
those of you who don't know deadmau5 was
he was at he was the special musical
guest at Nvidia's party that they had on
Friday night after their big public
stream that they had and I did rage out
to him pretty hard for an hour or two
however I did not get a chance to meet
him he was he was there playing pretty
late and I had to head back to the hotel
at a certain point and it's it's
actually funny that you bring that up
because I had a briefly spoken with the
PR manager of Nvidia and asked demos I
paid do you have it I'm sure you have
some good connections to deadmau5
obviously it'd be great if I could build
him a nyan cat themed PC because using
the speaking of which the cable babka
cable configurator I made this
monstrosity this rainbow-colored 24-pin
ATX just doesn't as an example to see
what it could do and see what the
quality was and I think it turned out
fabulous so I approached the guy from
Nvidia who's a really awesome guy he set
up the whole event this weekend and he
was like dude that's a great idea but we
already kind of did something like that
forums
actually they Nvidia built in like
several custom modded PC
based on every single one of dead
Mouse's cars that he owns so obviously
it was a good idea because Nvidia had
already thought of it however I wasn't
able to really go go strong with that go
forward with that concept because it's
sort of already been done a little bit
too late to the late to the game there
but maybe maybe who knows I'll think of
something else and pitch it to and video
later it'll also be great to get a
couple more of these these graphics
cards from Nvidia so I could do some SLI
testing maybe two way maybe three way or
just have some extras on hand so I can
maybe do a custom water cooling build
with one of them I think that'd be super
sick and still have a couple others for
SLI testing or just general benchmarking
and comparison videos and things like
that so I'm gonna try to work with
Nvidia for you guys and see if I can get
maybe one or two more of these for for
additional content that's really gonna
expand the potential and the
possibilities of content that I can do
with this particular GPU so very
exciting stuff but again cable mod
configurator thank you guys for
sponsoring the show if you guys are at
all interested in making something as
amazingly disgusting or amazingly
beautiful as as your heart desires
whatever your imagination has at its
will then go ahead and check the link in
the description below in this video's
description and you can be on your way
to creating the cable extension or power
supply cable of your dreams very cool
stuff okay let's let's talk about one
more thing sorry
really quick I want to mention this
isn't gonna take long why is it asking
me if I want to leave okay shirts i I
just restocked a bunch of shirts and I'm
only mentioning this because a lot of
you guys have been asking about it
everything is now back in stock the new
BIOS flasher shirt has has been in stock
for a while since since I first brought
them to the to the website here but more
recently the CPU cooler shirt in both a
navy blue and a Heather Navy which is a
softer material quite more comfortable
but if you prove it you know prefer the
darker color that's nice too these have
both been replenished as well as the
stay positive shirt which a lot of you
guys have been asking about also the the
blue arrows that you see here for to
represent the intake cuz you know
positive pressure and all that yeah
have also been revamped so these are a
little bit brighter than the picture
shows it will be a lot more vibrant
when you actually pick one of those up
so feel free to grab one of those shirts
guys available in a variety of sizes
okay enough of me rambling let's let's
talk about let's talk about booted on
last week's episode we had who was it we
had Michael Michael with this beautiful
evolve ATX system you can see his specs
right here yeah 6700 K and 16 gigs of
ram with the GT with two gtx 980ti s in
sli those are reference cards of course
he they were branded by zou tech and
whatnot but I mean just just take a look
take a look at this beauty and you can
really see why he is our week one
finalist for this season to boot it's
just a fantabulous system I really love
that again that'd be quite cool it's
absolutely beautiful and just cable
management is so on point here
everything about this system just just
deserves to win the the season but we
have more we have more where that came
from guys so without further ado why
don't we go ahead and jump into our very
first contestant for this episode which
is Fani I have no idea if I'm
pronouncing your your name right Fahmy
or if it's Faye me I I'm really sorry
I'm butchering that shit I don't I don't
even you know I have no cultural
horizons that are really expanded I'm
very in my bubble
I don't know ethnic names very well so
forgive me however you do have a
beautiful system and I can't pronounce
the names of all the hardware you're
using here so fantex and through Pro
awesome case core i5 4046 90k you've
also got a Kraken x61 cooling it and
gigabyte z97 ex gaming 3 motherboard 16
gigs of a vexer core red ddr3 memory and
a GTX 970 g1 gaming from gigabyte so
let's go ahead and take a look at your
side here side profile ok looking pretty
good here can see you've kind of gone
with a red black and white themed which
is always always nice I kind of like
white to be thrown into a red and black
theme more so than just red and black
for whatever reason I think that third
color really kind of a you know
complements the the other two colors
very well and obviously a lot of red and
black themes or there's a lot of red and
black theme computers already so adding
the white just adds a little bit more
personality it's a little bit more
diverse never thought I would say you
need more white to make something
diverse
but but there you have there's a first
for everything I guess so okay so we've
got a pretty sweet system here cable
management looks good your your cable
trainers are on at least your your PCI
Express cables there however they still
look a little bit I don't know a little
bit kind of bent out of shape I'm not
sure if you're just in the early stages
of training or you need to do a little
bit more stretching out and kind of um
you know training them maybe with
without the cables you know actually
just bending them manually to get them a
little bit straighter because they look
a little bit crooked here your 24-pin
definitely looks a bit cleaner and from
this angle or I should say for in this
lighting it looks like your heatsink is
kind of a weird shade of orange however
I know for a fact and from this picture
as well that they are in fact red so
that's of course the the z97 X gaming
three which I can confirm does have some
red heat spreaders there or heat sinks I
should say on the the vrm so that
matches beautifully with your cables
there and yeah like the beginning of
your cables here from the PCIe ports on
your graphics card look really clean
like they look super straight is just
kind of when you get to the bottom the
bottom end of that those cables where it
looks a little bit a little bit crunchy
but overall they're very clean system
here you've got some nice fans in here
some aftermarket fans as well as the
stock fan tics ones as well and then
let's see is there any more pictures
that you sent besides the money shot
okay here so you've got some LEDs on
here Wow okay this this looks really
nice actually you've got some white LEDs
that are around the perimeter of your
case which gives everything kind of a
neutral glow but then you've also got
like this awesome lava aesthetic going
on with your RAM and the audio trace
layout on your motherboard speaking of
which that's really looks really bright
at least from this picture I don't know
if you altered the modified the
brightness in this picture which are not
allowed to do and boot it by the way
however it looks really bright it's kind
of illuminating the lower left corner of
your case and I think it really evens
out the the glowing lava aesthetic that
you have coming from your RAM so I think
that's that's good you have a really
nice looking some really nice glowing
accents here with with the red in the
system I think that looks really cool
also why
to light up on the the local logo on
your wind force logo which also looks
good very good on the white lighting -
everything's super even it looks like
you've got pretty much all sides of the
case illuminated I can't tell if the
rear has some LED strip strip edge on it
however the rest of it looks very very
even and that is something that is
always appreciated here on booted so
overall yeah Tommy Pham Fannie Fannie
your fam fam BAM okay I don't know why
I'm just continuing to butcher your name
but a nice nice system I like it let's
move on to Daphne okay Daphne you've got
a Thermaltake g42 commander which is an
interesting case for this build since it
is so high-end however I think you did
specify that this case has some sort of
a sentimental value to you I don't know
if you know maybe a loved one gave it to
you or if it's your first case or I
don't know you keep your grandmother's
ashes and urn like inside of it no
that'd be really creepy though but for
whatever reason I think it's cool I kind
of like when something is sentimental as
far as like compute computer hardware
and not just you know the latest and
greatest part that I bought because it's
new and stuff so I like that sentimental
value aspect of it and let's see what
you've got inside of here 4790k you've
also got two gtx 980 s in sli beautiful
got a pretty substantial SSD arrangement
here as well and your your platform z97
on an AC uses sabertooth very nice 32
gigs of corsair dominator plats ddr3 of
course and shoot shoot Joe did I say
they were 980 s yes they are 980 s yes
they are
okay stop second-guessing yourself Kyle
you're you're you're smarter than you
think you are sometimes no not really
okay white cables I like it these are
actually coming straight from your your
power supply these are not extensions
and I think that does add a bit more
refinement to the overall look it is
nice to see like everything's very
consistent here you've kind of gone with
like a very color neutral scheme as well
so you've got you know pretty much all
black with some some silver and white
accents white coming from your cables
and silver coming from your your
Dominator plats your RAM as well as that
very fan
the EVGA bridge the sli bridge that I
actually have one in hot line back there
took me long enough to get it installed
however I this is kind of the same thing
that we saw with with Fahmy with fellas
gonna go back to Fahmy here for a second
how he's got the where are you funny or
where's that picture okay so how about
Fahmy 'he's got like lava in the top
right and he's got glowing lava on the
top left or a bottom left sorry daphne
has the same thing going on but with
silver so he's got silver Ram and he's
got a silver SLI bridge and you might
not think too much of it like yeah so
what the hell are you talking about Kyle
however like I think that looks really
good that that's a good idea to even out
the colors in your system to have just
one color in one corner of your rig
looks very imbalanced unless that's kind
of what you're going for for whatever
reason but I prefer to have a more like
even coat of color as well so it would
it would have looked a little bit
one-sided had you only had one or the
other the bridge or the RAM so I think
that evens out quite nicely and holy
smokes Joffrey I should call you
Geoffrey because Geoffrey is the name of
a stupid little evil twerp in Game of
Thrones thank you for the generous
donation sir just got your vibe awesome
let's see do it yes I mean I'm gonna be
doing a lot more vr content in the near
future
especially with with the oculus rift on
its way actually I'm probably getting
that around the time of Computex so by
the time I get back from Taiwan I should
have a rift on hand that had arrived
that will have arrived and at that point
I'm gonna be doing a lot more comparison
videos between the two it's kind of hard
to do a review on the vibe itself right
now when I don't have a basis of
comparison for it so once that riff
comes in bet your bottom dollar that I'm
gonna be doing a lot more of your
content it's gonna be good
but okay so Daphne honestly your
everything is looking good here I like
the again I like the colors I like how
how really simple and clean it is
I like that SSD placement that's right
in front of your power supply cuz
honestly power supplies don't look all
that great anyway even when you take the
take the sticker off or whatever it's
it's just a big slab of materials let's
go ahead and take a look at your money
shot okay so you've got a money shot
you've got you say you have six
thermaltake white LED ring fans okay the
ring fans are really cool and I believe
you also have a picture of
this lit up with those said fans let's
go ahead and take a look at that yes
this is this is beautiful I like this so
that they are white LEDs they do have
RGB ones as well
however this looks awesome I really like
how this looks you've got just got a
really subtle glow with those with the
help of those fans as well as the the
wind force cards your your your H your a
IO for example is also lit up white and
the RAM itself the RAM has you know the
dahm dahm plants have that white LED in
them so everything's kind of really mesh
and really well for me here I like the
the subtle glow and I actually kind of
like per or prefer that you didn't
include a white LED strip because that
would have sort of softened the rest of
the glow and it wouldn't have been as
pronounced and I really like that
decision that you made there so
altogether very solid build geez I can't
I don't know what else to say this is
this is a this is this is a good build
yo very very innovative spots for the
SSDs again in front of the power supply
and I just noticed right now that
there's one on top of your drive cage as
well so good stuff good stuff man I hope
you do I hope you do well in the voting
round you deserve it let's move on to
John John has a Corsair 760 T I don't
know why I'm on this picture this isn't
the first picture I should be showing
you guys this is the first picture 760 T
this is a refrigerator of a case but
also a very good one we've also got a
5820k as well as two gtx 980ti
hybrids in sli from EVGA so these are
the hybrid ones that pretty much have an
AO pre-installed right out of the box
these are freaking awesome cards and
you've got two of them in this system
Holy Smoke Co along with 32 gigs of
Corsair Vengeance ddr4 this is probably
the higher on the higher end of pcs that
we've seen in this season for sure and
look at that side profile very nice so
this is again a red red and black themed
not the most original however always
always a classic I suppose you've also
got some really clean cable extensions
those are super straight and I think
Fahmy could probably take a lesson out
of your book take a page out of your
book on how to straighten those out so
good job on that got the cable trainers
on them as well so you've got a lot of
tubing here with your a i/o on your for
your CPU as well
both of the hybrid cards and I don't
know I mean this is this either looks
really cool to some of you or it's just
too much or or maybe it's like the
arrangement of how the the tubes are
kind of flowing from from point to point
because you do have a lot of options
here in the case like the 760 t4
radiator mounting and you could have
gone in a few different ways I'm
actually not a fan of how the top video
card has a tubing that goes right
directly in front pretty more or less in
front of your a i/o covering up that
really nice water block on the the
Corsair h 100 GTX there maybe you could
have mattered it to the back and kind of
tuck tuck the tubing a little bit more
towards the rear of the case or even
possibly just flip the radiator on top
around to have the tubes flow a little
bit to the left again towards the rear
of your chassis however I'm being
nitpicky because this is a pretty
stellar rig you've also got the the
velcro straps that are kind of holding
your tubes together I forget who it was
on last season - booted but they had the
the cable the tubing separators and they
were actually they were also red like a
brushed aluminum in red on his his
Kraken cooler I believe and it was
absolutely fantastic
I highly suggest that you look into
those and see if they look good with the
type of tubing that you have here
because I think it would be a huge step
up over the velcro stretch that you have
here I don't know but when I see those
particular like the really thin Velcro
velcro straps on this side of the case
my mind wants to think like I'm so used
to seeing those on the rear side behind
the motherboard tray where all the cable
management takes place that I don't know
maybe it's just you know I've been
conditioned that way however those
cables those two separators you should
look into those you've got also a very
nice sli bridge from MSI which
definitely ties everything together I
also very much like how your your Rams
your Rams are color-coordinated and
they're alternating just like the cable
extensions that you have here or you
know your sleeve extensions are they
sleeved extensions or are they yes they
are it looks like their extensions
because you're using the these stock
cables and it originally from your from
your power supply there speaking of
which I would also suggest taking that
power supply sticker off I don't think
it's really doing much it's not hideous
it's it's pretty color
neutral it's just pretty much white and
black however I don't know I don't like
have seeing the the rail chart down
there and it just looks a little bit too
busy for me if the 80 plus certification
sticker and stuff like that just just
rip it off for Christmas sake but look
at this look at this money shot
absolutely beautiful
I am super jelly of this setup I would
like to have one of these in the future
but damn look at look at them LEDs so
you've also got some Thermaltake ring
fans here I forgot to mention 140
millimeter these are the RGB ones you
can kind of color coordinate however
you're pretty much stuck with red or a
similar color since you do have a lot of
other components in here that are red
looks really nice though it looks really
good you've also got some LED strip egde
on at least the bottom of your case it
looks like maybe at the front of your
case as well but definitely it's it's
hot at the bottom not so much LED stuff
going on at the top of your system which
maybe you could have even do that a
little bit more although it does kind of
add to the the fiery pit of hell there
at the bottom of your system with just
having more of the illumination on the
lower half and kind of blasting upward
kind of creates some some interesting
shadows and things like that maybe
that's what you're going for so
altogether beautiful system beautiful
case and just really well done with with
all the cable management and stuff let's
move on to Adam Adam has a simpler
system but it should not be disregarded
as a worthy contender in the season of
booted here because it is very clean and
that is of course why I chose him as one
of our contestants today he's got a more
modest system with a 4690k and this
isn't an NZXT s340 we've also got a GTX
970 from Nvidia's and he did specify
that this was 1,500 rupees in in
Canadian Canadian rupees not necessarily
$1500 however I did see that you know it
is an approximation I didn't say it had
to be $1500 to submit just more or less
around that ballpark area so so yeah
this is a really nice system here you've
got some orange accents on your your
your heatsink fit for your heatsink fans
on the what is that a cooler master
hyper 212 Evo and you've also got orange
accent which is custom of course on your
video card so it is a reference design
the GTX 970 that you have
for your cooler however it looks like
you've taken it apart maybe spray-paint
spray-painted it did some plastidip work
maybe to get that nice orange color and
it looks very nice if we take a closer
up look at the the money shot here it
doesn't look like there's any kind of
blemishes with with your your spray
paint job you clearly know what you're
doing and of course that goes for the
the rings around your fans as well for
those Corsair SP fans and yeah you did a
really nice job dude it looks like they
came straight out of the box that way I
wouldn't have even known that someone
spray-painted them so that's really nice
you do have some standard you know stock
cables from the power supply which I
would have liked to see some custom
sleeved extensions that were also maybe
orange and silver or orange and grey and
black for example that would have really
looked nice and I also kind of wished
that you had more gotten more corsair
fans maybe the the airflow series fans
that you could have just replaced all
the stock fans in the s340 width and
also spray-painted the the rings orange
for those as well and that kind of would
have just added a bit more orange to
this scenario but for the most part this
is a very clean system oh I almost I
almost clicked on the cable management
picture that would have been bad let's
go ahead and take one more look here
very nice very clean system altogether I
think this is a very well done very well
done sir
so good job Adam on that and let's go
ahead and round off our contestants with
Kyle no this is not my system this is
just another Kyle there are other Kyle's
in the world I can guarantee it I have
met a couple of them fantex and through
Lux okay very nice case I did this is
the same case of course that I did my
white build in and naturally it was the
white version of this one you've also
got a core i7 6700 K with the massive
fan Tech's cooler I tried to build with
about a week or two ago and that didn't
work out because I failed to get some
low profile memory but this is the the
pH TC 14 PE which is a hell of a cooler
just really freaking massive and the ACS
z170a motherboard 16 gigs of vengence
low profile ram and an AMD r9 Radeon r9
390 with a Kraken x31 AIO oh snap so
yeah so you've got I guess this was
maybe a
this is a reference or nine three nine
you didn't say if this was you know some
kind of you know engineering sample that
you might have got or a reference design
or if it was aftermarket from a board
and adding board partner and then you
then peeled off the cooler to slap on
the crack and x31 I'm not too sure but
at any rate it does match very nicely
with your red and black theme here
although the sleeve extensions also look
good kind of got that stripe egde going
on and you've also got kind of a white
black stripe edge with your with your
CPU cooler because you've got the the
two white fans with the white shrouds
and you've got the black heat sinks to
go along with that so that kind of all
meshes well together and let's take a
look at your money shot okay from from
this angle it also looks fairly tidy
cable management is again on point we've
got some LED pictures I believe the lux
has seven I can't member if it's seven I
never remember if it's seven or nine
different color presets that you can
choose with the lux it's got built-in
lighting that you can see kind of on the
trim the outer trim of the case as well
as inside and it does look like you got
those fantex LED strips that actually
match up with with the LED controller on
your case that handles the the case
lighting so that that's that's really
clean really looking good you've also
got just another color and angle here so
altogether looking pretty nice man so it
looks like you've mounted the the the
radiator for the NZXT crack and x31
maybe on the bottom of your case right
worth like the hard drive cages would be
thank you very much Todd for you the
donation my favorite beer um jeez
favorite beer I don't really know what
my favourite beer is it that's really
hard to say that's like saying what's
your favorite movie your favorite song
but I really do like stouts both
American and you know imperial russian
imperial stouts are also really good and
I guess on top of that I like IPAs I'd
say stouts and IPAs are my jam so yeah I
do like I do like me some Pliny the
Elder which Paul and I have been
drinking a little bit of lately cuz some
some really awesome guy had gifted them
to us at Lands Syndicate a few weeks
back uh but yeah thank you very much for
the donation appreciate that is there
anything else I have to say about this
this
chessy or this the system here I don't
think so I think I think everything
looks good if I had one critique maybe a
critique hmm I I don't really I feel
like the cables could be a little bit
more more more aligned if you maybe just
picked up a few cable combs for those
things and did some training I think
that would look pretty nice and I mean
hey it's a black and white theme system
everything's clean
alright that's that's a lot to say about
that and those are all the contestants
that we have to talk about today so
right about now you should be seeing a
link pop up in chat my beautiful wife
wifey sauce who is using my account by
the way I'm not married to myself she
will be posting that link in chat and it
will prompt you to go vote on one of
these five pcs you can only vote for one
and you can only vote once despite what
it seems like it seems like you can vote
multiple times but I've checked it it
seems like you can but it doesn't
actually count the second votes so go
ahead and and really think about which
system here that we've talked about
today deserves to go on to the final
round while you do that I'm gonna
briefly talk one more time and give you
all you late comers here another look or
a first look at the cable map
configurator if I can go ahead and go
back here we can talk about them really
quick cabe Ahmad all right making making
your cables to order I didn't even
mention at the beginning of the show
that you can also change the length of
these extensions so or or the just the
power supply cables in general
regardless of which extension or cable
you go with you can pretty much it
ranges from I think it's like I don't
know exact the exact range but as short
as you need or as long as you need so
that you don't have any excess cable to
work with in your build because that
would kind of really be shitty right if
you had an awesome cable Austin awesome
custom cables that you just couldn't fit
literally inside of your case or that
made cable management a pain in the ass
so we'll we've also got the custom
extensions now which are just very new
newly available to us these haven't been
around for long I think they just added
this feature to the site earlier this
week
so again you
go ahead and add one of these here we go
here's the slider so you can basically
range from 200 millimeters all the way
up to 600 millimeters and I don't know
what that is an inch is right off the
bat but it is it there's a fair range
anything that I'm sure you guys will be
happy with anything in between these
values so very cool stuff again this is
my let me go ahead and switch back to
but Baba myself and my custom sleeve
cable that I still don't know what I'm
gonna do with other than maybe just you
know use it as a conversation piece when
people come over okay look at this it's
funky colors hey it's like you know
taste the rainbow but yeah this is one
that I actually made off of the
configurator website from cable mods so
really good stuff again paracord
sleeving very high quality there's no
Sri heat-shrink which I absolutely
despise so that's good and you know it's
it's it's solid solid solid build
quality oh Jesus
so again link in description below of
this video if you want to check that out
and we will be talking about some more
cable mods stuff next week as well for
these little odd spots and an exciting
announcement as well for all of you
viewers of booted in regards to possibly
a cable mod deal of some sort well it
won't be on the configurator but it
might be on something else that's all
I'm gonna say
okay I think I think that's that's
that's good enough right you guys have
you guys have had some time to look it
over and we will be and think about oh
I'm hearing myself in the headphones go
ahead and eat that mute it okay let's
let's go ahead and talk about the the
winner we don't know who the winner is
yet but it is time to figure that out
boom boom Todd Johnson to you brother
thank you for the donation uh none thank
you very much I appreciate that but it
is time to vote
which of these pcs should go on to the
final round honestly I think they're all
great I think it's probably gonna be
between two of them in particular I
don't want to say but we've got Fani
Daphne John
Adam and yours truly nope that's that's
a different Kyle this is a different
Kyle but all right let's see what you
guys thought I know who I know who I've
got my money on but it's not up to me is
it the week two finalists of booted
season four is Daphne holy smokes
Daphne with 44% of the votes and this is
actually a closer closer closer closer
matchup
I don't know the word I'm looking for
this was like not too much of a
landslide like booted usually is so
that's kind of nice
there is a John who came in second place
with 27% of the vote and then Adam
trailing behind with 16 sorry Fahmy you
know you got six better luck next time
straighten up those cables but Daphne
holy smokes
yeah geez with the with the the
sentimental g42 commander case will you
look at that yeah this is a very clean
system and honestly I swore that you
guys were gonna choose a Adams build no
not Adams John's I thought you were
gonna choose John's build just you know
cuz it's got you know water-cooled
hybrid gtx 980ti Xand stuff and lots of
rams
but i could not have been more wrong man
congratulations Daphne you are a week
two finalists for booted we'll be seeing
you two weeks from now in week four of
this particular season for the final
round where you will be going
head-to-head again with week one
finalist Michael got week week one
finalist Michael and now week two
finalists Daphne sort of similar systems
in a way kind of a black and white theme
going from Michael to Daphne
Daphne's got a little bit more
horsepower but you know that's not
exactly what no actually no I'm sorry
Michael has more horsepower defens got
to 80s to nine 80s words I
I don't even words but yeah should be an
interesting
interesting matchup I hope we don't get
like freakin another black and white
themed PC for next week that B they'll
be like the first season to booted where
we all had NZXT cases well that's the
first season season two I don't remember
