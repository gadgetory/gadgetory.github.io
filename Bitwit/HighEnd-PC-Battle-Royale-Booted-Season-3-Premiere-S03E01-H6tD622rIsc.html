season three this is the actual premiere
of season three which is the high-end
season what what a frickin intro of the
year that was I thank you all for being
so patient with me and and and YouTube
live streaming that that sucks
sometimes but at least we all have a
home here that's reliable here on Twitch
so that's nice I'm very pumped for this
season of booted because by far nicest
looking systems that we've seen in the
entire series again these are fifteen
hundred dollars or more in value give or
take and a lot of them are well well
beyond that threshold so very exciting
stuff these are really some sexy pcs
that you guys have submitted to me and
and thrown together and I have been
brave enough to step up to the challenge
of that is butit's so another thing that
I wanted to point out is uh we have a
couple announcements here there's a lot
of things going on a lot of UI I did
mention this last season that there
might be a back-to-back high-end season
back-to-back high-end seasons of booted
because I did receive so many high-end
entries and today I can officially tell
you that that is a go and season four
which is going to be in March no April
May May is also going to be a high-end
PC season of booted so thank you guys
now however that doesn't mean you guys
won't be able to submit your your
systems for for that for that season
next season because there are a lot of
systems that I had to disqualify just
because the camera quality or the photo
quality was so poor even though they
were really nice systems some of them I
was just like oh all such a wasted
opportunity this would have been so good
but you know either lighting was off it
was blurry so I am gonna be asking you
guys for more submissions however don't
fire away just yet don't send me
anything just yet I'm going to be
announcing the exact submission period
the dates that you can submit your
system your high-end system for next
season next week so on next week's
episode on next Monday is when you'll be
able to submit that but but make sure
you tune into next week's episode and
and wait for me to give you the green
light
where you go ahead and submit anything I
will not be opening or or downloading or
accepting any any submissions until that
time so don't send me anything just yet
it will be wasted okay another thing so
yay for back-to-back high-end seasons
we've also got a new polling system in
play for today's episode I'm just gonna
test the waters with it I don't know
exactly how it's gonna be this is the
first time I've used it so we're not
using straw poll today we're gonna be
using a different system that is
allegedly pretty secure there is no
CAPTCHA but it does seem to be a little
bit more substantial with like a
development team behind it
more so than straw poll which seems like
just some crack addict than his basement
made it so so that's good and also it's
a cool school system because it doesn't
reveal the results to you guys instantly
right after you vote so that kind of
increases the suspense factor a little
bit you're not gonna know who's actually
won today's episode or any episode for
that matter until I reveal the results
to you so that's kind of cool
mixa mixa makes things a little bit more
interesting and there's another thing
there's another thing guys my new BIOS
flashback or my new bio splasher shirts
are now for sale if you guys follow me
on Twitter you already know this because
I tweeted it out but here she is this
design has been long in the making and
it's finally here and I realize you
aren't seeing any of this because I need
to do that now you can see it so this is
for sale you can buy this thing this is
this is wearable for your chesticles
only okay so it's I'm very proud of this
design my good friend and ex coworker at
Newegg Tina at creative tart designs she
she she actually helped me design this
guy it was my concept and she brought it
to life very well done I'm super excited
about that and it's only 20 bucks it's
$20 shirt and you can get it in two
varieties so you've got the the metal
gray which I rather fancy quite much and
you've also got the maroon color which
honestly was the best looking color to
pair with kind of the the color palette
of this design so really liked both of
these options go ahead and pull the
trigger on either of those if you're
sewing
lined I put a link in the description
below or you can go to awesomesauce
network.com slash store to pick up
either of those and I'm still selling
the CPU cooler shirts as well in the
nice fancy Heather Heather Navy gray or
haven't had their navy blue I should say
and the good will stay positive shirt
it's always good to stay positive even
when you're streaming system craps out
on you actually it's not the system's
fault it's not the system's fault it
said I blame YouTube I blame YouTube
okay anyway um that is pretty much gonna
do it for that we're gonna go ahead and
take a look at our sponsor for today
which if you guys notice by the the
lower thirds there you see my finger
isn't it funny how my finger is still
invisible here I never really fixed that
it's a professional I am little finger
so overclock by KL mod today and
actually for this whole month we they
are our exclusive sponsor for booted so
thank you very much cable mod really
awesome guys they are particularly
interesting because they have a really
nice offering here with their magnetic
series and their foam adhesive wide beam
LED strips so you've actually got two
options here you can get the magnetic
backing which is great for metallic
cases of course or if you've got some
kind of aluminum
you know Lian Li or silver stone case or
something like that are in win
particularly the magnetic isn't really
gonna be that effective so they do have
the foam adhesive as well I have tested
these strips thoroughly I did a video on
them comparing them to the BitFenix
alchemy 2.0 strips and they are just far
superior in almost every way possible
not just you know not just the magnetic
you know force or whatever or you know
the the foam adhesive is really strong
but in terms of brightness and
saturation these things are pretty
killer yeah just go ahead and watch my
comparison video it'll show you
everything you need to know but link is
also in the description below for this
as well asus or a compatible so if you
guys are familiar with the maximus 8
formula and other the the hero the other
hero rog board that has the the built-in
RGB header these strips are compatible
with that as well and they just they
offer a variety of different flavors
here so you've got these colors that are
presented by this little spectrum here
now they've also got RGB RGB is pretty
sweet
and I'll be doing a quick little demo of
those strips later on today so without
further ado let's take a look at our
first contestant on today's episode this
is exciting is really exciting hey you
guys ready yes
yay alright here we go first guys Matt
Matt you're up alright you've got a
Corsair 600 C I have a recent fondness
for this case oh I forgot to Santa my
cellphone I apologize
someone just submitted their PC to
booted I hate you I hate you whoever did
that what two people I just told you not
to why do I even bother I don't know all
right so we've got a core i5 6600 k gtx
980ti look at this storage configuration
here with the the two micron you got an
m5 50 and an m6 hundred you got three
terabytes of solid-state storage and I
do believe that you had mentioned in
your entry that you work for micron so I
guess that gives you some that give some
explanation as to your beefy storage
array but let's take a look at the rest
of your system here good components good
solid Hardware all around not much to
complain about there but looking at your
alright so one thing I'll say about the
600 C is that it's a it's a love it or
hated affair when I first saw it at CES
I'll be honest I wasn't too thrilled
about it I was like that's no but that's
not how an ATX chassis should look
that's that that goes against everything
I know and familiar and comfortable with
and then it wasn't until I recently
built a system inside of one when I
realized this is actually a very nice
case and you the look of it kind of
grows on you I think we're just so
trained to see a system an ATX tower a
certain way that when you literally flip
it on its head it looks awkward but the
more I look at my system that I just
built by the more
love it it's really nice and you've done
a fantastic job here Matt I think with
the color coordination look at those
sleep cables and how perfectly they
match up with that gaming 7 motherboard
it's just it's probably the nicest
implementation of that board I've seen
in the system simply because your cables
are so on point in every way
it just looks excellent I really like
that I also like how you threw an AIO in
there that looks very classy and I kind
of like how it's just a 120 at the rear
and not a 240 mounted at the bottom I
think that actually looks nicer than the
system I built which was using a 240
millimeter radiator and what one thing
that I would add if this was my system
would be because you know the 600 C has
such a large side panel window in fact
the entire door is just a window so you
can really see everything from left to
right and so because of that I would
probably throw in some fans at the
intake that were more akin to my color
scheme so you know the 600 C comes with
really good intake fans already
I shouldn't say intake fans but just
fans but they have gray blades so if you
really wanted to up the aesthetics and
just be a little bit more matchy-matchy
I'd go with some white blades personally
or or or red if you can find good red
ones to spray-paint them or something
but the gray just you know whatevs it's
not terrible though and you do have one
optional shot that you sent me of the
LEDs turned on in the night time and
this looks very nice I can see you have
the wind force logo I'll match it up
with that as well
yeah this is a really nice system bro I
like how you're using cable combs cable
management is also on point just not
even just the colors but those are
really the only two big cables I see
other than you know some little front
panel connectors there and your your CPU
but overall very clean built broski very
clean build and if you ever want to
donate one of your SSDs one day you know
where to find me
let's move on to Alex Alex in the house
up let's go ahead and take a look at
your case first we've got an NZXT s340
wide edition of course 40
90 K and a GTX 780 Ti with 32 gigs of
HyperX ddr3 dam but some beefy some
beefy memory specs you got there so this
isn't exactly a current generation
system but by no means is it is it weak
or anything like that this is very
formidable some decent specs in there
and Jesus this is beautiful man this is
really brings a brings a tear to my eye
just how clean this is just the straight
lines just going down flowing like a
waterfall of perfection and electricity
actually a waterfall and electricity
would not go very well together don't
ever try that but wow man I really love
the PCIe cables here the the cable combs
are really doing it for me
and like other than then your 8 pin EPS
CPU connector that's really the only
other cable I can see in here it's just
it's just so clean look at how clean the
cabling is looks great and I just love
the the black and white and that just
that touch of that splash of green on
your geforce reference cooler really
draws my eyes to the card and the card
matches just as perfectly with
everything else the other thing i will
say here is that i love the fact that
you won with a cry or a cooler
especially that model because it's got a
black heatsink and i think that was a
really wise choice aesthetically but
also you've replaced all the fans in
this system and even added a few with
some Noctua industrial series fans and i
think that looks really nice especially
with those whites vibration corner pads
pad corners that you placed on each of
those fans top-notch man that is tip-top
well well tip-top there's another angle
just absolutely beautiful I kind of like
the staggered Ram slots in there as well
looks very nice very nice and there's
just one more angle there you've got two
SSDs looking pretty it would it would
have been nice of you spray painted
those SSDs honestly like maybe like both
of them white because it's already on a
black power supply shroud so just having
the white on black I think would would
really look
give it a premium feel overall though
very nice job Alex
they're nice Alex very nice alright next
we've got Erin I'm sorry if I'm not
pronouncing your name correctly Arif in
you got a Corsair 760 core i7 5820k I
believe this is the only x99 build in
this this episode I'm not too sure you
got a cryo rig r1 ultimate and a GTX 780
so again not super current gen with the
graphics anyway but you've got two of
them
so who's complaining really and and it
looks like you've kind of grayed out the
GeForce logo as well I'm not exactly
sure how you did that but it looks
pretty good yeah yeah Mon that looks
really nice that looks really nice I
love that cryocooler
I don't even care that it's like
vertical or whatever it just it looks
beautiful you know overall your your
system looks very like modern it looks
super modern like looks like the modern
style apartment that you buy in GTA 5
it's like the nicest one and you can
like customize it when you go with the
modern one it looks like that's like the
PC that they would have in that
apartment you guys feel me you guys feel
me
but yeah honestly I like all the fans ah
you've got a ton of airflow in here as
well so that's nice taking a closer look
here one thing I would add is you know
if you're gonna whites leave your PCIe
cables you might as well go the extra
mile and do your 24 pin as well it's
literally the biggest cable in your
system it's gonna be the most noticeable
and I just feel like having having
another element of white in that region
of your system what kind of disperse the
the color evenly around around your
system it's like the reason why I you
know have the the odd bends that I do in
hotline is because I really wanted to
extend some of that pink color all the
way to the back of the system where it
was kind of lacking
in pink so kind of the same concept
there but overall very very nice job
here got that that aftermarket SLI
bridge as well
yup yup yup
damn this is gonna be really tough for
you guys the live audience to choose to
choose a finalist here because these are
all really nice systems next we've got
Yakov Yakov I feel like I need to say
that in a Russian accent while downing a
shot of whiskey or no vodka Yakov I
again sorry if I'm butchering but you
got an end to pro from fantex 4790k and
and also a gtx 980ti
with a Kraken g10 yo there's I kind of
like this your graphics configuration
here because you've got a PNY video card
with an NZXT custom cooler or
aftermarket cooler and aftermarket
corsair fans on the radiator of that
cooler so there's like three different
companies that have come together to
create your graphic solution I think
that's awesome
it's very well thought-out in my opinion
and I also like how the you know again
this is very thoughtful of you you
you're so thoughtful Yakov so thoughtful
thank you for that bottle of vodka you
give to my my family we go eat potatoes
later together so I also like the fact
that your water cooling tubes are
matching both on your CPU cooler and the
Kraken they're identical sometimes you
get that coagulated tubing like from the
original h 100 or even from like the the
fractal Kelvin coolers and not to say
there's anything wrong with those types
of tubing but to just see both of these
coolers have the exact same aesthetic is
really I think key to making this a nice
looking rig and also just a nice job on
the the color coordination here you I
can see that you've colored your power
supply shroud because there is no red
and black and through Pro option that
I'm aware of
I believe you said you plastidip that
whole shroud
you just dunked it and I think that it
looks very professional let's see I
think you have a don't you have a yeah
there's a close-up shot of it guys look
how clean that is that looks really
clean right I'm not blind
it looks pretty clean to me I like it I
like it alone
here's a money shot also a nice job with
the Triton X some really nice looking
dims there again seems like a lot of my
critiques here as a slight as they are
as miniscule as they might be have to do
with the cable management or not cable
management put the cables themselves so
again we've got you know your black your
flat black ATX cable here but then
you've got a red one for your power your
your your PCIe and I understand that's
probably just what the the stock cables
that came with the supernova g2 however
you've spent a lot of money in the
system apparently already might as well
spend a few extra bucks on some custom
sleeved cables cable mod cells those two
didn't you know but but yeah yeah man
this is sweet I see you also painted the
front of your case there in red so
that's nice nice job ukhov nice job for
a red and black build that we see so
many of these days that does look really
stands out for sure
next up actually last but not least
we've got Leon our as PC number five in
his Corsair or Pac Man man his H 440
razor edition chassis from NZXT we've
also got a Kraken x61 in here you are
rocking a 6700 case er and your video
card is a gtx 980ti from gigabyte gaming
g1 excellent cooler love the wind force
cooler always have looks really great
performs great super low acoustics
however I see these two little blue
things on your graphics card on your SLI
fingers and I wish that they would die
horrible and slow painful death
just just take them off yeah no big deal
but yeah this is a sexy little looking
little system here I like the green
sleeve cables that go very nicely with
the the Razer logo taking advantage of
that color coordination and you've got
that that beefy looking Ram cooler on
your on your Corsair Vengeance memories
and I believe that lights up as well I
like those cable combs too
those are nice here's a money shot okay
get rid of those blue things get rid of
the caps whoo
Leon Leon you're you're a romantic
aren't you Leon look at that
that is that is just dandy my goodness
oh that's sexy yep guys if you are if
you have a decent camera and you have
LEDs in your system take pictures of
them when you submit your to booted
because they help a lot it's one of the
one of those opportunities to you and AH
the audience as in me as well because
this looks fantastic I really like the
way this looks you've got white LED
strip inside the case which gives it a
more like neutral and even coat of light
however you've also got the green LEDs
going on with the RAM cooler your liquid
cooler on your CPU as well as the wind
force on your GPU so I don't know the
combination of those two I think looks
really nice especially with the white
fan in the back very pristine very clean
nice job Leon probably the only thing I
would suggest here is uh I don't know
even your SSDs match the color scheme of
your system like the black and the and
the kind of silver yeah there's not much
to critique here just take off those
damn blue caps and I will love you
forever
damn it uh but yeah guys guys guys guys
we just we just went through the first
five high-end pcs and booted it's
freaking freaking crazy
mind and it's it's it's time to vote on
which of these bad boys you think is
best
quite based on their quite frankly based
on their appearance their combination of
hardware choice and I don't know which
one which one you think has the biggest
brain or heart which one has the biggest
heart so right about now you'll be
seeing the link going out to the photo
album where you'll be able to see all
the high-end or the high-res pictures of
each of the contestants as well as a
voting link the boating link will take
you to the poll and you will then vote
on which PC you think deserves to go on
to the final round in week four on that
note let's go ahead and take a look at
our sponsor one more time we've got
fanned so used to having two fantex
sponsor the show that I almost slipped
their Kayla Mott again with their
whitening technology if you guys are
wondering where to buy cable mod strips
from you can go to performance pcs calm
very trusted and reliable sites they've
been around for a while I've gotten a
lot of stuff especially for my for
hotline back here from this website and
I've always had really good results
customer service fast shipping more or
less from the site so go ahead and pick
something up from cable mod here alright
they've got good stuff if you guys are
interested in all in a little quick demo
let's go ahead and switch over to the
the PC cam that's right I have a PC cam
right here the bottom left this is with
silent night the silent night build I
should stop calling it silent night
because it's no longer Christmas
color-coordinated themed but you can see
here I've got some red LED accents going
on now this is an RGB LED strip from
cable mod that I've installed in here
actually just before the show and if I
reach over with the controller here cuz
you do have a little RGB controller you
can see I've just changed the color well
boom you got blue right there you'd also
adjust the the brightness let me turn
that down so it goes about that dim and
again I should mention that this the PC
quality level is potato-like
like times potato this is not very
indicative of how good these LEDs look
in person again check out the video that
I did on them which I did like a couple
weeks ago shouldn't be that difficult to
find you've also got white but let's
let's switch it up here oh boy
you can you can give your your PC a
seizure that's always fun if you want to
rave rave out like it's the 90s and
there is speed adjustment as well so you
can as you can see I've just slowed it
down so it's not gonna freak us out too
much there's also a strobe effect that
gradually fades and transitions eat
smoothly between the colors instead of
just abruptly cutting from one to the
next I particularly like this setting
the most I think other than just you
know the freedom of being able to choose
any of these colors that you want
there's three six nine twelve fifteen
there's fifteen colors in all and ten
varying levels of brightness for those
static colors and as well as ten varying
levels of speed for the special effects
like the transitions and whatnot so
overall very cool I'm super happy with
with the cable wide wide wide beam LED
strips that I honestly have about three
systems now that are using these brands
of strips and absolutely no complaints
I'm using all magnetic I don't even deal
with the foam adhesive anymore it's just
too much of a hassle
I'm always swapping them out anyway so
but if you guys want more information or
you want to buy them link in the
description below of my youtube video
because we are on twitch right now so
haha bear that in mind
got myself there I think I might have
flubbed that in the intro but let me see
do I actually have no I don't have it
okay that's fine all right
good bye PC cam thank you for the live
demo there I think I've let you guys
decide long enough on which of these pcs
deserves to go on to week four so I'm
gonna cue up the dramatic voting music
I'm gonna crank it up baby screw it
let's let's make it loud let's make it
loud and from
I can scary I don't care I don't care
anymore
so the way this is gonna work guys is I
have I have the link that shows the
results shows the results for this year
show or for these this poll so I'm gonna
swap that in alright you guys ready you
guys ready for this whoo um I haven't
even seen the results yet I don't know
who's gonna win so let's just let's just
do this together all right on the count
of three one two three
Wow in first place we have Alex with a
hundred and forty two votes 40% of the
vote goes to PC number two which is Alex
let me go ahead wait before I switch
over here I'm gonna just zoom in here so
you guys can see those are the results
with Alex in sin first place Matt took a
somewhat close second 25% of the votes
and then we had Yakov and then Aaron and
Leon and last sorry Leon
but hey Alex you're a you're a bad boy
I don't know what I'm saying what's up
you can really yeah okay I've been I've
been notified that you can vote multiple
times in the poll which I was aware of
however I specifically remember putting
uh enabling a setting in the poll that
would restrict the voting to only limit
one vote per person so that's really
interesting and that's a little bit
concerning that it's not actually saving
my settings yes if you guys see right
here this is the Act these are the
settings that I'm using wait Oh pop this
in see look these are the settings I'm
using right here allow one votes per all
time so I have it under heavy security
limit the number of votes to number one
heíd results button yeah that's really
strange so were you guys able to okay so
some people voted twice I'm gonna redo
the vote because that's just BS I'm
wondering why that's why that's the case
so let's let's try shouldn't be showing
you guys this but um give me a moment
here today it's just full of surprises
she's gotta roll with the punches all
right so I'm gonna go to share theme
settings huh
yeah I even have the box that says
voters can select multiple answers
unchecked so why can people select
multiple answers or that's different
than voting twice but I still only have
a maximum of one vote allowed one vote
per year all right save over and then
the cool thing about this is that I can
go to my dashboard and I can clear the
results I'm gonna clear him clear um
alright and then I'm gonna go ahead and
put up boop boop boop let's let's try to
let's try to do this again all right you
guys you guys pretty ready you guys
ready to vote again huh huh all right I
guess I'm gonna send out the voting here
vote again and and let me know let me
know let me know if you can vote more
than once again still because then then
I'll just go to straw poll and say screw
it you can vote what can vote multiple
times again what what is wrong with this
thing
interesting yeah I know
alright let's let's just do this we're
gonna straw pull it I'm gonna figure
this out of the later time cuz that's
just silly
all right who wins one Matt to Alex
three orphan or kick of five Leone
create copy boom boom
alright final pull go go go go
alright let's let's see if strawpoll
will work strawpoll has always worked
however I don't think I did captcha
dammit dammit no okay hold on let me let
me do it one more time
Matt to Alex
three air fin for yay cough

are you guys down to just keep voting
like you guys have probably like changed
your mind on who you think you should
vote for like halfway through all this
I'm just causing you all to second-guess
yourselves alright I am requiring you
all to use caption now what do you guys
think do you guys think I should
administer another poll with CAPTCHA or
do you think it's do you think it's fine
right now the way it is
and so far
all right all right we're just gonna
we're just gonna do this we're just
gonna do it final poll final poll if you
guys see any suspicious of suspicious
activity however new poll all right
we're doing CAPTCHA we're doing CAPTCHA
all right I feel yeah but but I'm a bum
hold on what didn't work again what's
going on
oh all right give me a sec I love how
the victory musics already playing and
no one's even been selected yet this is
awesome okay bump but I'm bump it up
dude
yeah bump bump bump
what a great season premiere this has
been a jerk-off knows what I'm talking
about
alright create poll all right
this is it final final pull all right
can't hear the music all right
boom maybe you can hear the music now
all right so I'm gonna give you guys a
few seconds to think it over
obviously you don't need too much time
to vote this time because you've already
done it like 30 times so um
getting your votes captures their know
multiple voting still no music that's
weird okay
who cares it's just music stupid stupid
music alright I no no it's it's playing
I don't know why they can't hear it it's
what if I crank it up like this
no nothing whatever you guys don't need
music to be entertained
alright you're better than that alright
let's move it up move it over to the to
the results all right who wins this
who wins who's it gonna be and it's
still Alex Alex still won alright I know
results are more or less the same as
they were for the first time around but
it is still good that you guys notified
me that multiple voting was allowed on
that other poll service because that
wouldn't be good nonetheless
congratulations Alex you are our week
one finalist and you will be going on to
week four
in the final round competing against the
next two finalists that will be electing
in the next few weeks here
congratulations if you guys want another
look at Alex's PC yes I'm glad that you
want Alex cuz I this is probably who I
would have voted for us well I just
think everything was well executed just
that super clean just that cable alone
oh it's like a it's like a rope ladder I
just want to climb it but yeah man
really nice job especially on the fans
once again looking forward to seeing you
kick some ass in week four
but I will say man you've got some
competition because you guys have not
seen the next ten contestants or even
the next five for that matter and it's
gonna be a season y'all it's gonna be a
season so if you enjoyed the high end
season of booed so far
despite all the technical difficulties
if you could just wipe those things from
your mind for a minute and just focus on
the the playing field that we're
actually on operating on at right now I
really do like the high-end seasons I
think they're a bit more interesting
just visually seeing what people can do
when they had that extra budget to spend
on you know more frivolous things like
cables and and custom coolers and things
like that so guys leave me some some
feedback in the comments of the YouTube
re-upload once it goes live or or just
tell me in the chat right now and I'll
I'll read it and stuff but if you guys
want to catch the show live and you
