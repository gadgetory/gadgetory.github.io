so with Christmas just around the corner
it seems like we're all on the lookout
for cool tech items that won't leave our
wallets battered and bruised so whether
you're thinking of gifts for yourself or
a fellow tech lover I've compiled a list
of some neat gadgets I found for 30
bucks or less and you can find links to
all of these in the description our
first item is the hashtag poor people
Gaming Mouse that packs in some premium
features at a not so premium price the
m8 o1 mammoth from red dragon sports a
16,000 400 dpi laser sensor 9
programmable buttons 5 memory profiles
wait tuning and durable Omron switches
so your hand breaks first it also
features teflon pads of braided USB
cable and a contoured body to fit your
hand comfortably you can actually find a
handful of gaming mice at this price
point but I found this one to have the
best overall features and aesthetic
especially if you're already rocking a
red and black set up what better item to
follow than this 3 foot mouse pad from
reflex lab this extra large desk rug
features waterproofing stitched edges
and enough room to move and groove for
your mouse keyboard and other items
rubber backing ensures a non-slip
surface and the super thick plush
material is machine washable for those
of you with bad aim if you're looking
for a versatile bluetooth speaker for
just about any environment look no
further than the O maker and for the
rugged construction is waterproof
shockproof and dust proof making it
durable enough to survive a fallout 4
nuclear explosion the three want Audio
Driver and passive subwoofer lets you
enjoy up to 12 hours of high def back
and among Bluetooth 4.0 the unit also
features NFC for easy pairing with
compatible devices come for the quality
stay for the rubber ducky while most of
us already have a good screwdriver on
hand for building pcs a simple Philips
head is hardly enough to avoid all the
warranties our heart's desire this 23
piece screwdriver kit from knife
precision tools includes just about
every bit you need for DIY tech
tinkering the alloy steel blades and
solid driver come in a compact storage
case and deliver a high-quality feel
that's backed by a lifetime warranty try
not to avoid that one another great tool
that every techie should have is the six
and one utility from swiss tech a friend
of mine actually got this for me a few
months back and it's been on my keychain
ever since the stainless steel doodad
includes a bottle opener a super sharp
straight and serrated blade and multiple
screwdrivers mine has already seen a
fair amount of use from cutting the
Christmas tree down from my car to
building a PC on the side of the road it
is an emergency next up we have this
five pack of micro USB cables from I or
GE Android users like myself might
appreciate the various lengths nylon
braids data sync and quick charge
capabilities that this affordable set
brings to the table perhaps the coolest
feature of these cables is the
reversible type-a connector that allows
for a quick and easy insertion because
remember folks charging cables are like
hookers if you don't put it in they
don't charge in the family fun spirit of
Christmas we have the top race 4-channel
mini quadcopter that puts a spin on
typical drone fanfare with an included
pair of wheels so you can move and
groove as you roll on the ground or
scale the walls and ceiling it even does
back flips whoa
the unit also comes with a controller
and one drone battery offering up six
minutes of fly time though a full charge
only takes nine minutes and replacement
batteries are available for purchase
this little gadget is sure to entertain
a young loved one or the 12 year old kid
in all of us Hey shut up in there
I'm sick of your attitude moving back to
the adult stuff I found this awesome USB
3 SSD enclosure from initech apart from
supporting two and a half inch drives
measuring 7 or 9 and a half millimeters
thick this enclosure also has a built-in
USB 3 hub with three ports this is nice
for a laptop or even desktop users with
limited USB 3 made of ABS plastic the
case is completely tool-less sports a
power switch and includes a USB 3 cable
speaking of USB 3 you can find some
pretty cheap 3.0 flash drives these days
without looking far but there's more to
a thumb stick than its rated speed the
SanDisk cz 48 being a great example
without overlooking the generous 128 gig
capacity the drive has a solid keyring
loop that keeps it secure one on the go
and a retractable connector which is way
better than a cap that gets lost faster
than a white girl in Compton at a
hundred megabytes per second reads you
can probably find faster options at this
price but overall the cz 48 checks all
the boxes for what a long-lasting flash
drive ought to have rounding off our
list of tech is a battery pack from Raph
power for power users who need lots of
power for all the power they use with
almost the exact dimensions of my 13
thousand milliamp bank from Rosewell
this unit
packs in a hefty sixteen thousand seven
hundred and 50 milliamps that's almost
enough juice to charge your Galaxy s6
four times or your iPhone six six times
although heaven Apple users already been
charged enough the ravpower can charge
up to to mobile devices simultaneously
with its 2.1 and 2.4 amp USB ports the
ports also feature eye smart technology
which automatically detects and delivers
the optimal power current to your
devices for fast and efficient charging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
