to booted this is season five the water
cold edition where that's all we're
featuring this season for the last
season a booted is liquid cooled systems
and we are in episode three right now so
we're going to be looking at the last
five contestants of the entire series
today so that's five more more liquid
cooled PCs and and they're all pretty
sweet hopefully you guys are doing well
whatever whatever you might be doing or
whatever you're up to I hope everyone is
finding themselves in high spirits oh my
god I can hear myself where where is
that coming from where is that
where's ah ah ha ha shut up Kyle there
you go totally planned totally prepped
to this um sorry for the late start
xsplit literally crashed the second I
was about to hit a stream glad it
happened before I started streaming
though and not while but yes yes it is
it is very exciting this is uh it's kind
of a bittersweet moment excited to show
you guys these last five pcs but also
sort of sad that it's going to be the
last five of the entire series but I
guess that's what makes it all special
so hopefully you guys enjoy this one um
no real announcements to announce other
than there is a giveaway that just
launched today between me Paul and that
one guy Jay's two cents and I guess
we'll throw a fractal Josh in there
because this is a fractal design sponsor
to giveaway it's our day of refinement
giveaway and a lot of people are upset
because we're not giving away any
Hardware per se but we are giving away
in experience which is a day of
refinement so you get picked up from you
know LAX or whatever crap Airport Josh
flies you out to you get picked up in a
Rolls Royce
this one in particular that's me look
it's got like star star patterns like
illumination on the top it's pretty
sweet it's a rolls-royce Wraith I don't
know much about cars but I know that's
like a four
dollar vehicle and then we take you to a
yacht you'll be chillin on a yacht with
like me the other dudes like this yet it
doesn't look very big but they've got a
40-footer which is I think the one we're
gonna be on which which has like a full
bar that's that's that's a that's my
thumbnail for the video I posted I
thought it was yeah there it is anyway
go ahead and enter that video enter that
giveaway if you're interested if you're
not obviously carry on and ignore this
message um but let's let's take a quick
look at last week's finalist who was Ian
with his redonkulous portal to build
portal portal to what have you the
portal franchise yeah he this was a well
deserved win a victory in my book
because just like uber points for
creativity and style and it is just
really well executed take a look at the
side profile here got two separate loops
one for a CPU the other for his two gtx
980ti s they're using the beloved
well-known portal colors just beautiful
beautiful bends all around so well done
Ian you'll be going head-to-head with a
Brad who was the week one finalist and
whoever may take away the finalist spot
for today at the end of this episode so
should be pretty pretty heated
competition so on that notes why don't
we take a look at Luke who's our first
contestant here the first of last Rock
an alien lay pc 0 7 s this is a one of
the land Lee's fancy wall-mounted
chassis I actually have the PCO 5s
smaller version Mini ITX small
form-factor on my wall over there and
it's a really nice case it's got
tempered glass a side panel obviously
he's removed it here for this shot but
this is a there's definitely some
modifications going on here too a lot of
the components so he's got a 6700 K and
980 TI kingpin so that has been
superband to get the highest quality
ASIC out of all the 90 DT is very nice
very nice card and if we take a look at
the side profile here I don't know if
you guys have already guessed the theme
but the theme of this PC is overwatch
and I know that because of a picture
you'll see later but also I think this
guy I don't know I don't recognise this
little icon here on the PCI PCI ribbon
cable the extension I don't know if he's
that's necessarily an overwatch
character it probably is I've only
played the game for a few hours but
overwatch colors for sure got the white
and black I'm sorry the white and orange
going on look at those Dominator
Platinum's how those are modified he's
essentially painted them painted the
outside white and then he's painted the
little heatsink portions orange and he's
also swapped out the light bar for from
a white one to an orange one so those
are all rockin orange light bars there
in the memory there's another close up
look at that that that dude dude the
helmet looks pretty wicked cable
sleeping is on point as well and here's
how I know it's an overwatch themed
build for sure because once he puts the
side panel on you can see it's been
laser etched with some overwatch
branding which looks super super cool
it's kind of got like a nice frost look
but not too overwhelming just very very
clean overall and he's also done a shot
with the LEDs on got some white LEDs in
there love it yeah it looks looks pretty
sweet I'm really diggin all these um
these video game inspired builds like
the portal 1 and I've got overwatch I
just think it's a really great thing to
build your system off or build it around
is a video game a really nice fun well
respected and critically acclaimed video
game and I definitely like the tubing
going on here it's not hard to be so you
know doesn't make me hard makes me more
on the soft side but that being said
it's still uh still routed pretty nicely
the runs
relatively clean and you've got some
orange fluid in here and that can be
seen through the reservoir and the tube
that's that's coming from from that
portion but the rest of the tubing is
white so you can't really see too much
of the liquid so it kind of gives like a
two-tone I think you just kind of did
that to mix up the color palette a
little bit instead of just having one or
the other you decide to go with two
colors there I think that was creative
and definitely the all the painting the
paint job on the the motherboard is is
very well done on the heatsinks damn I
hate sinks with those orange stripes
looks very professional it's a nice job
Luke you get a two thumbs up for me no
that doesn't really mean anything in
this show still still fun still fun to
give thumbs ups next we have gia Hong
I'm so sorry if I'm pronouncing your
name like an American tourist but Jae
Hong whatever your name is you've got a
pretty interesting system here and this
is built in the EVGA had drawn err which
I don't believe this is like what the
Hat John looks like right off the bat
you've definitely done some
modifications here there's a lot more
Plexiglas going on or acrylic whatever
that is and I really like the way it
looks it's kind of guts a semi open-air
design because there's no real front
panel it's just kind of bare in your
face it makes it look very industrial
it's like and the thing is it looks it
looks well done like it's like it was
done on purpose it doesn't look like
someone just ripped off the front panel
and like left the build you know half
put together it actually looks done
intentionally and you pull it off quite
well I love the reservoir at the bottom
below those two fans blow your radiator
and stuff I think that's a really cool
place to put it and I just love the two
bends that go straight up and through
that part of the Hadron had John gives
me a hard-on making a lot of sexual
references let them anyway if we take a
look at the side here
you can see it's just your CPU that's
been water-cooled custom water-cooled
with a very nice race storm CPU block
and your video card is gtx 750ti
probably not the the calibre of card i
would expect in a custom water-cooled
build however if that's good enough for
your needs Who am I to say otherwise
right if you're not really gaming all
that much you're gaming it 1080 on and
high settings or you know in some games
very high settings are cool for you then
right on that's awesome and looks like
there's just been a lot of modifications
here I like a little a little fan over
your VRMs on the motherboard that little
white fan that's kind of cool and if we
take a look at the money shot gives us a
closer up look here also got a nice
little fan at the back there that you
batte it on we've got 32 gigs of HyperX
fury ddr4 and believe there's another
shot here so here's just another angled
shot at the front I really like that
plexi I don't know
I'm usually not a fan of plexi but it
just looks really well done here and
then here's a shot of it on your desk
I usually don't accept pictures on
booted of like setups but this is the
only shot where you had the LEDs on so I
just wanted to show that you have LEDs
in this system and this is also the
second to last episode of the entire
series so who cares at this point but
overall very very creative build I have
not really seen anything like this
submitted to booted ever it's a good job
you get you get points you get points
for originality
jihong well done job well done
ibex we've got Michael Michaels also
rocking alien Lee chassis here the PC o
8x this is one of those another one of
those beautiful cases with tempered
glass panels all around to meet you from
hardware connects that does a really
nice build in this and Michael's done a
really nice one here to the core i7 6700
K gtx 980ti
super clock from EVGA both CPU and GPU
have been water-cooled and the first
thing I'll say off the bat is you got
these nice Noctua fans the front that
you've painted white and it looks like
they're really they came out really nice
my only gripe is at the brown not a huge
fan of the brown corners this those
stock Brown quarters I feel like if
those were black that would have been
just would have matched more color
neutral stuff
also the Noctua fans that are on your
top radiator and at the rear the back of
your case felt like those could have
been maybe you could have could have
flipped those maybe make the corners of
those white if you don't want to
spray-paint them
chrome axe is a chrome axe that makes a
those rubber vibration stopper or
vibration replacements for the Noctua
fans you can go ahead and check that out
but here's a look at the side profile
very beastly love that glass tubing that
you've got there with kind of a looks
like an off-white kind of a pearl color
fluid that's in there it's really pretty
matches really nicely with the the
chrome fittings which are very nice all
the radiators I believe I don't know
you've got a mix of ek and alpha cool
radiators here got an ek dual d5 pump
and this is uh there's no bending here
of the tubes they're all straight and I
think you've done a really nice job just
making these runs with just straight
tubing and fittings I really especially
love the the tubing that goes from the
video card down and they both kind of
like follow each other parallel and if
you look at the bottom there's a drain
valve a drain drain port that he's faced
downward at the bottom of the case and
drilled a hole in the bottom of the case
so that if he ever needs to you know
drain the system you can just kind of
hang up hang the case over the edge of
the table or something like that connect
a doesn't even have need to connect
anything and just release the valve and
and out comes the fluid I think that's
pretty pretty inventive
very nifty of you Michael here's a money
shot cable sleeve and cable sleeve it
looks a little bit rough rough around
the edges looks like it's been through
some maybe hasn't done its full boot
boot camp training if you need to train
those cables a little bit more send them
back to cable cable camp
I don't know I'm saying um but again
just like this fluid I really I'm really
digging the color here with the Chrome I
do like the chromatic the nickel-plated
ek waterblock as well believe there's a
couple others here yeah you've got this
one another shot of the front in front
of the fans I'm sure I mean they're not
to avange though so at least they're
performing great even if I don't agree
with the brown corners they sure are
functional and here's a look with some
LEDs on beautiful this is um very lovely
very very lovely indeed sir so thank you
Michael for saying that in number four
on our list is Phillip Phillip is
building in a fanfic fantex
the Phoenix n2 ear for our fantex n to
evolve great case as we all know 4790k
so reckon the last gen has well and
we've got a GTX 970 amp extreme in there
full water cooling here CPU and GPU whoo
you've definitely filled this up I like
it I believe in the notes that you would
sent me Phillip you had mentioned that
you had modified the the front of the
case to accommodate a 280 rad so that's
a two hundred and eighty millimeter
radiator at the front there and I
believe n3 bulb only has support for a
240 at the front so that's the case if
I've got that right then very nice job
I'm loving how thick it is and I love
how you just get barely enough clearance
for your video card I love it I love it
when you just bear it when it barely
fits it's so satisfying that's what she
said you've also got a nice 120 at the
top it looks like yes beautiful
sorry that's a 140 that is a one fodi
get it right and nice combination with
the
the red and white fittings I really do
like that you've also got some team
group extreme ddr3 2400 rams got the
Rams in there which I believe you've
also painted white to correct me if I'm
wrong and chat but those look painted to
me could be wrong though and a phobia
phobia you see 2lt water black that's on
a black job digging that back plate on
that on that GPU to bra Baron ass here
you've taken off the the top top panel
of your case and given us an inside look
at as to how you've mounted that
reservoir which is mounted sideways
looks like you've also got a fill port
the thread at the top there which is
very convenient you want to bleed your
system and things like that well thought
out very well thought out well planned
and a killer looking system here Philip
I also really like that pump that's just
down there I love that I love the
flexible matte black tubing I don't know
why the matte black tubing just always
looks super sexy to me
turns me home runs male alright and last
but not least we've got Patrick Patrick
you guys were lured in by the by today's
thumbnail in any way you have Patrick to
thank he's got a his system rocket in a
graphite 780 t from Corsair great custom
water cooling chassis with a 5820k so
we're rocking that x99 with the msi x99s
sli plus motherboard 16 gigs of samode
Dom Platts from Corsair 2600 and the GTX
980 three of them in 3-way SLI oh snaps
and as for as for CPU or a CPU and water
block we've got ek supremacy Evo and of
course ek water blocks all around on
those 980 s fatty ole reservoir there
sticking in the middle so you've got
some nice tube endings here yo
everything looks super clean your cable
is your cables is probably the best
cable routing that I've seen on today's
show very very clean very clean indeed
and that is a fat radiator at the front
there holy shite
it's got to be thicker than my bed and
um nice EVGA sli bridge that's in
addition I do like how you've gone with
a also very color neutral theme here
with the kind of transparent the clear
fluid probably just using distilled
water and kind of just a black and white
overall theme some silver slash gray
accents but all together very neutral
which is really nice because as we'll
see later works really plays nicely with
any kind of LED color you might throw at
it
and here's another shot here's a money
shot beautiful yeah them them cable
trainings you got it down bra so here's
a here's a shot of it all lit up with
white LEDs is what it looks like
and just looks really really clean um I
think transparent fluid like just
distilled water looks a lot better when
it's being illuminated like in the dark
than it does just during the day because
it kind of just gives like I don't know
the light just bounces off of it kind of
creates these reflections that looks
more crystally it looks more like glass
to me for some reason at least in photos
I really like the way I just plain plain
old distilled water looks and here's
what I was talking about because you got
a color neutral system you can pretty
much just pick any color that you have
with your NZXT a hue plus and you're
good to go
you want you want if you want a purple
system today you can do purple you do
green on Wednesday blue on Friday red
for the weekend it just gives you
flexibility in the aesthetics Department
for sure
are you just leaving on the rainbow
spectrum that looks great
so I use it for a thumbnail cool
good job Patrick I also want to mention
that you've got a little you've got
another 120 millimeter rad at the bottom
I almost miss that the very bottom of
the case I think I think that's cool
because there's that lower kind of
compartment that the 780 T has you can
fit some stuff down there clearly so
good job Patrick I am impressed all
right so those are the five contestants
right about now you'll be seeing a link
being pasted in chat by one of my one or
more of my beautiful moderators
including my wife Maggie spider fan and
cell maybe they'll just all paste the
link at the exact same time and bombard
chat with their thundering presence but
at that point you guys should click the
link and decide who you're gonna vote
for this is it this is this is this is
the arguably one of the most important
votes of the series because it's the
second to last vote it's the last poll
that will ever take for a finalist this
is the final finalist pull that you're
at stake so choose wisely
um and then while while you guys are
thinking about that
mulling that over just really quick I'm
gonna whore myself out I'm selling
shirts still nothing new but I have
restocked several of these so if you
guys were waiting on something to be
back in inventory it probably is
including the ever-so-popular CPU cooler
shirt this is just the plain old Navy
shirt
one of the first shirts I ever kind of
sold on the store it's now available in
a Heather Navy which is slightly more
comfortable it's a little bit of a
lighter color but it's super comfy
softer fabric and looked at the same
price so so why not why not get the
better one I don't know stay positive
you know great reminder I've seen J wear
this shirt in his videos a couple times
I know he secretly loves me
if you like positive air pressure you
should definitely get that shirt and of
course bios flasher shirt
flying off the shelves so punny so punny
you can't really tell but at the very
bottom corner of the the chip it says
BIOS it's easier to see in person but
just for any kind of like by pastor who
is looking at your shirt for a while
trying to figure out what the hell it is
because they don't build computers maybe
that a little BIOS they will cue them in
uh so yeah pick it be sure y'all they
are good for your chest he'll cover your
testicles grant you access to many
places that would not serve you
otherwise
should you be half naked all right on
that note I think you guys have had
enough time to vote
you're all pretty quick thinkers quick
on your feet so let's go to the drawing
board shall we
that's not the right phrase let's go to
the voting page doesn't quite sound as
awesome but all right so we've got some
options here Luke with his sexy
overwatch built and Leon the Lee case we
also had Jay home and his heavily
modified EVGA had Ron Michael with just
crazy awesome tube glass tubing and
chrome fittings another beautiful ele
case Philip with just a bunch of cool
 just black and red and white and
then we had Patrick with more cool
being very very articulate right now all
right let's see who won who wins going
to refresh dream Patrick 55% of the vote
holy schnikes wait have I not been
showing it the entire time damn it I
totally not did not mean to do that
go to the go to the camera go to the
camera look there I was a anticlimactic
shame on you Kyle
so here we go Patrick with 55% of the
vote
243 votes crushing it man with Luke in a
fairly far behind second place but still
very nice job fluke with your with your
overwatch build but man Patrick this is
exciting because this is about the lead
the margin of lead that Ian had with his
portal system so it's going to be
interesting to see like all these guys
who have won by a landslide competing
two against each other for the first
time and the last time actually so
congrats to you Patrick we will see you
again back here at 5:30 p.m. Pacific on
Monday I know what time my show starts
and yeah we will see it in the final
round baby three finalists one winner
will take home the $500 grand prize
should be pretty epic thank you guys so
much for joining booted if you enjoyed
it go ahead and toss it alike and yeah
that's pretty much it I'm gonna go I'm
gonna go work on a particular video that
needs to be posted at a particular time
and that is all I can really tell you
about my plans for tonight thank you
guys so much appreciate you all coming
out and have a good rest of your day
evening night whatevs see you guys later
