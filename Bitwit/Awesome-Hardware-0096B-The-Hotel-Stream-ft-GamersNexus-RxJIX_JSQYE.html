sounding okay
but without holding too much else up
welcome this is awesome harder episode
96 it's a very shortened episode because
we are attending some thing right now
that we cannot really talk about at full
until it really not now so we do have a
special guest with us here this is Steve
from gamers Nexus they have a website as
well as the YouTube channel I've
actually pinned you guys on my featured
channel this channel so you guys can
find them very easily through there I
have to do that because I'm a better
friend than Paul and if you guys missed
Paul's half of the show which just aired
you can go ahead and head over to
youtube.com
we're gonna miss much elite didn't miss
much these are very short and kind of on
on the win portions of the show because
we just have a lot to do still at this
event right after this so we're a little
bit pressed for time
Steve's actually got to catch a flight
fairly soon and do a bunch of other
stuff so we're gonna keep things very
quick and concise but if you guys have
any questions and you'd like to also tip
us with a donation or something like
that go ahead and blow up chat we'll be
reading all your questions about things
that we can actually talk about and and
it should be fun I think Steve had a
couple topics that we already discussed
on Paul's half of the show I think that
was probably Oliver Angie has a horn one
more I guess I don't know a whole lot
circles disclosure I don't know a whole
lot about this one in terms of hands on
experience but I've been reading a lot
of news lately about the Intel Atom CPU
that are used in several Nass products
like what sine ology shifts and so some
of those have issues some errata issue
where they just slowly eventually die
and sign all adji said that all of their
naps units like the DES 15 15 plus and
all these other ones that are popular
have passed all of their internal
requirements for a quality product so
there's no recall or anything but
they've extended the warranty by one
year on a huge list of products there so
nothing's wrong but whose extended worth
right what's what what is actually been
happening to them I don't know the full
details I'm sure someone has followed
the news closer but there's Intel Atom
CPUs like the c2 5 3 8 that have some
errata issue where they just die so if
that happens in your nas so i nology
saying that they see they've seen
nothing historically with their units
that are that would be affected that
would indicate like data loss or
anything risky like that but they've
extended the warranty anyway so yeah
interesting imagine if you had like a
complex raid configuration and your
processor in your nas died that might be
slightly difficult to turn I guess the
three angles of their panels but the
problem is like hopefully you can just
buy the same unit and plug it all back
in right I guess it depends on yeah on
exactly what's being read and written at
that time that's a good point I said
I've had my share of failed attempts at
rebuilding a raid array after they after
whatever controller was originally Ryan
had something should have happened with
it but all right well this is anyone
who's got a one of those atom processors
look into it yeah and I'm gonna check
into that especially if you have really
important data on your net to have it's
alright hey we got a $5 donation from
Richard Dortch thanks Richard least 5
bucks for you to count wait super stuff
Verizon because my x-15 Sabretooth slash
oh it just scrolled up where'd it go
I can't go up anymore favorite tooth /x
5670 at 4 gigahertz is getting pretty
long in the tooth
Oh keep up the good work yeah we're
pretty stoked for resin as well Richard
we're very stoked Verizon incredibly
stoked yep can't wait to open it up
resonance stuff also three dollars from
Josh rockin an R nine fury he says at
1080p and want to move up to 1440 should
should I go ahead or wait for Vega to
get a 1070 so go ahead and get a 1070
now a week for Vega Vega AMD has
promised a launch in the second quarter
that's what they've said publicly
through so yeah our yeah first half so
yeah so we're expecting probably
Computex timeframe is what I would guess
for a launch like that so I mean for me
this question always heavily like comes
down to what you're using now and if
you're like if it's acceptable for you
are you doing okay now if you're doing
okay now then I'd say it's always worth
it's a weight if you know there's a big
launch coming up especially within a few
months but that said if you really like
just don't like your setup right now and
x58
is getting pretty long in the tooth at
this point like you said then it might
be worth heavy consideration I'd say at
least wait a day or two to make your
final decision though yeah well there's
been a lot of leaks in the past few days
in the past few hours and when there's a
lot of leaks generally that means that
there's something actually happening so
yeah normally and this is something
we've published several times on our
channel and website
I am frequently when folks ask should I
wait or buy I will almost always say buy
because normally it's a question of
months versus like you have a vague idea
of when something's coming out and it's
like waiter by 4kv like back in November
that's basically saying uh probably just
buy because your options are skylake KB
leak which is probably going to be a one
to three percent better and
Reisen was who the who lagged knows when
you know and that was gonna come out
that but lately I have been saying wait
like for the past month because Intel's
not exciting that's not news relate to
anyone there's still fine products if
you have a really old Sandy Bridge or
something that's still a good upgrade
but you know
Rison should be competitive and it's not
far away so yep so if you can wait just
wait yep next up we've got a $5 donation
from disturbed thank you very much sir
tell Steve I said thanks and have a beer
on me at your super-secret event okay
awesome I believe that's a beer for you
Steve you know do you ever drink beer
spurgeon eyes these hot beer drinker so
Kyle and I will share I will open from
the team awesome we also had a ten
dollar donation from Lustrous he says I
love all the video videos you guys do
and I just want to show my support y'all
make my days at boring IT Help Desk way
better awesome this is the best types of
donations Thank You letras yeah thanks a
great donation and I'm glad that we're
able to provide you with some kind some
form of entertainment and hopefully
hopefully it's helpful at some times to
quality entertainment yes
quality entertainment from a random
hotel masters yeah so quality that we
have to like keep adjusting the iso
every five minutes as the Sun Goes Down
yeah I don't have studio lights we're
looking pretty orange right now I didn't
really have time to do much good white
balancing between halves but it's okay I
can still see her yeah we're a bare
minimum okay I would see
no blinking in the camera oh yeah we're
supposed to be blinking Morse code
signals to the truth sure people who are
looking for that kind of thing about
what we're not hiding anything
 are we I don't know did we given
how a slipshod just the setup of this
livestream was in general if you guys
had any ideas that we were trying to
sneak some hidden message or like plans
think we did there wasn't much time for
that yeah
find all 15 Easter eggs in this shot
yeah gonna happen there well this
painting clearly as we been discussing
the painting is the biggest hint really
really in the shower right now yes if
you want to enhance you know and read
between Nova seriously though there is
actually seated there yep go ahead and
screen cap now who knows what it really
means
oh nice you just screwed over so many
people because they're all gonna be
doing that you know it oh wait we have
another donation a dollar from automatic
Matt thank you sir Oh chat stay still I
wish you all a great trip in seriously
Kyle can you change charge three dollars
Wow you're just asking me to charge you
more money and side panel cleaning tips
we already gave you some I think I wish
you all a great trip and seriously okay
yeah oh say the same thing um so
basically what we were suggesting is
just use regular glass cleaner I mean it
is a piece of glass so anything that
works you know to your liking for
regular glass products we'd probably do
just as well on on tempered glass
microfiber cloth and yeah we said it
might have to show that gloves I mean if
you're really serious about getting your
system set up and you want to Christine
like you get you just gotta use gloves
or something like that to prevent the
fingerprints yeah and
the little thumb screws that you used to
put on the tempered glass because yeah
basically like use your fingernails
unless you just get a bunch of thumb
prints all over it fingerprints all
around but and so his question about
what you're charging for your premium
channel though like yeah have you can
have it like I think right now a dog
fifty is an introductory price for
people because it's very minimal it's
like yeah it's almost nothing to a lot
of people right just like sure we'll
throw that on there for a monthly
subscription have you thought though
that you might increase it in the future
and do you think that would be do you
think people would receive it well I
think you did a good job with the launch
in describing how how it works and
everything like that never the response
was pretty positive I think I think
there's potential for because I mean as
the channel grows I mean obviously a
dollar fifty is not gonna be the same
amount of money as it was you know when
I'm just a one-man operation like I
explained in the lunch video I'm in the
process of hiring my wife trying to get
a dedicated studio space and none of
that stuff is cheap and that's it and
that's just 5% of all the costs you know
that that are there for the channel to
operate smoothly and stuff so yeah
definitely I mean in the future people
are saying like we saw in chat that
dollar fifty is almost too reasonable
and you know it doesn't really there's
there's definitely room for more support
there I think and I don't think I'm
gonna increase it like in the next few
weeks or anything like that but maybe
six months to a year down the line I
think it's it's definitely a possibility
and I think also the fact that no one
has really done a paid YouTube channel
least in our tech space that I'm aware
of and I know Linus has his flow plate
flip floatplane Club which is a slightly
different I got a different platform
entirely but as far as like you know
YouTube and being on the same platform I
was a little I was a little nervous
about how to be received because YouTube
has always traditionally been a free
platform and so even though it makes
sense you know when you think about it
to have a paid channel in tandem with
your free one it's just a new idea I
think that I wanted to approach it
gently at first yeah it'll be cool
I mean I know this function probably
isn't there and probably isn't going to
be put there but it'd be cool if you
could keep people who subscribe now at a
buck fifty
when you up when you're in following
them in yeah I'm gonna say that's the
heart they know you want to start high
cuz it's a lot harder to raise the price
then lower area sure about it'd be nice
if you could just grandfather that man
like you're saying yeah thank you I'd be
a nice would be a nice nice speech like
some kind of early supporter benefit
type of thing yeah
and that makes you makes me like think
like it makes a lot of sense what Winans
is doing is creating his own platform
where you have full control over the
other thing as opposed to just being
limited by whatever YouTube provides and
honestly like they're paid channel like
infrastructure just seems like an
afterthought I think just because it
never really took off it just seems like
there's a lot of missing features that
you would think would be no-brainer but
yeah well the fact that they do in the
end slate yards you can do the like link
to a fundraiser they kind of says that
and patreon is one of them that's
supported to know is just like you know
they I guess the YouTube acknowledges
that their version is not that popular
yeah very true at least they know what
what's going on all right we have for
donations now I'm gonna read this first
one that came in because it's here right
now dollar from Luke F thank you
yes but floatplane has better bitrate
and image quality Luke is that Luke for
a friend ray we know that beat bloomin
LLB look L but maybe it's his pseudonym
or something like that
maybe Luke watches every single episode
of awesome hardware just waiting for us
to mention something about lion spec
tips of floatplane and they know we're
just modeling us on how not to live
stream that's right we're talking to
Linus about pollute Lane last night and
that is something that they have done to
make it a more appealing platform for
people want an alternative to YouTube
something that doesn't have ads and
something that they can contribute to
sponsors for so Linus actually it seems
like they've got a pretty good handle on
how they want to arrange things and
everything for floatplane Club and it
seems very interesting I haven't I
haven't checked it out myself but he did
say like the audio bitrate they D like a
hundred and ten ninety two-bit audio
which is often a big issue for YouTube
videos the audio can often get quite
compressed and sound pretty mediocre or
it's just required
in a hotel room with a lot of echo and
all I could say but I'm yes that is that
is definitely something to consider with
floatplane club I have three more
donations here that I copied and pasted
all right five dollars from tech life
ly fe wave to the camera and say hi John
like Ron Burgundy that's is he does that
directed to all the story I don't know I
don't I don't remember that being a Ron
Burgundy line does he say hi John some
point he says John he says don't I like
I like his with the things he says when
he's doing the sound checks and stuff
but yeah those are my chosen some of my
favorite sculpture sculpture called yes
that goes down to my belly uh whales
okay Anna okay well I hope that's I hope
that's enough free tech life
thank you for your five dollars vagina
you gets a pound so vagina five dollars
from Nick Demetri Attis copy that most
recent one cuz I didn't get that one
okay five dollars from Nick Demetria
Demetria at is without naming any names
are specific would you say in a
hypothetical situation the hypothetical
CPU market will see a drastic change
hypothetically of course I don't think
it has to be hypothetically yeah
processor we already know like horizon
this it's been talked about before was
then right before and there's still exam
as the architecture and rising as the
product that you buy but this has been
discussed for a long time now and Andy
has told us directly and we've been
today the chip will be out before and a
quarter before March whatever the last
day marches so that's all known
so yeah I would that mean anytime
there's a new CPU especially from
someone who's been largely dormant for
several years on architecture that's
gonna change things whether or not it
works is a different name we don't know
how much she's gonna change things we
don't know how fast the processors
actually are beyond the sort of limited
testing internal testing that AMD does
is shown us and everything so yes that's
a big reason why we've said to a lot of
people who ask us like should I buy this
now or not like we know that there's
gonna be a big old launch yeah like
everyone's waiting for it
it's been years and years since there's
been anything like this to sort of
dropped into the marketplace that will
shake things up so yeah it's definitely
gonna change things we just don't know
how much right and it'll be hit or
anything like that
yeah yeah but we all I think we all have
high hopes so yeah one question I copy
and pasted from ages ago or not question
I didn't get the person's name though
Steve recently stopped the GN after
pollen count recommended appreciate the
effort you put into the videos Paul your
quote shittiest video ever was genuinely
hilarious really editing on point oh wow
I always enjoy it enjoy your content
Kyle sorry that your whole Amazon
affiliate Fiasco is still unresolved and
I wouldn't joined it with ultra but paid
channels aren't permitted in my country
frowny face you can't do the patreon
thing and Kyle has been posting videos
to patreon for people who are outside of
the range of what you can access with
the paid YouTube channel yep
so check out if you really do want to or
just wait for his videos to come up on
this channel like they normally do speak
do you know what countries patreon
supported it if there's any I'm not sure
I've gotta have not any issues at all
hope guys complained yeah that's exactly
why I decided that well the videos only
gonna say well it's everywhere yeah yeah
okay I have a six dollar donation from
Tom Lucero he says what will the theme
of your first rise in builds be this we
can answer but uh the theme yeah what do
you think theme black and red okay blue
and green blue and green just a troll
yeah um the theme I haven't thought of a
theme yet I feel like the first builds
will just be like here's a build for X
dollars that you could enjoy that you
have spends a lot more on last year to
get the equivalent performance and and
that kind of thing and maybe you know
maybe make things match a little bit but
I don't know like themes computers I
really like those that like special
builds they haven't you know when you go
to events and they have like Computex is
really good for that you know this is
like a gigabyte had one there that was
like a just like yellow you know tractor
thing kind of oh yeah and yeah there's a
lot of great they always have a huge
amount of case mods yeah and their
sweets - builds and stuff like shall see
some pretty nice ones at Computex ooh I
saw yeah I saw one late yesterday I
think and now I can't remember where the
hell it came from it was a wine it was a
water-cooled build with wine so that so
the the the fluid in it I believe it was
actually wine that they used and in one
side they like it had casks on the
bottom how that was for thermals I like
the kind of dark red liquid going
through and then on the opposite side
cuz it was one of those two chamber
cases they had set up just a wine bottle
at an angle that where the liquid came
in so it was pouring the wine out into a
wine glass and then that cycled back
into the loop damn it was it was kind of
cool and yeah Wow
of wine I've got the glass material that
wine has often contained them yeah I eat
a glass I got wine and it's a specific
heat at a constant volume but I do not
have the thermal conductivity this will
have to be benchmark elated and we got a
test like white versus red rosy yeah
different properties are different
varietals yes come ordinations here
they'll run off fairly quick for the
shorter ones stellar from super assassin
95 Kyle when you when you went low Kyle
when will you be releasing more hoodies
probably the next month or so I have to
figure out exactly how quickly the
initial batch sold so I can part out
like the inventory like how many I'm
gonna get more there's an $8 donation
from a while ago
Bryant Alvarez yes you gotta read that
one good I'll go for it I wanted to do
my first build later this year and
hoping Andy will bring down those Intel
prices with a budget of $1700 do you
think an ACS prime Z to 70 AR ATX
motherboard is a solid choice I'm
wanting to pair it with a GTX 1080 and
i7 6700 does not say it's a case Q or
should I go more substantial a
motherboard in that price bracket you
have the great word hmm
well I mean like the motherboard to me
is is usually a little bit less of a
factor in that
I mean look when you're looking at the
motherboard you're gonna be looking at
connectivities like MDOT two slots you
have in there say this SATA ports may be
additional features that might be added
on there's lots of those available and
also just realized I missed this as I
was reading through it I 760 700 yeah I
was e 270 so so you might know I mean
III see no reason not to get kb lake if
the price is within 10 or 20 bucks I
didn't need a 7700 K instead of the 67
ok if you're buying it out rate but yeah
like we've said to a few other people
it's probably gonna be worth your while
to sort of see what the marketplace
looks like in the next say week to month
and a half that's how long we have left
in q1 and right and that might that make
sure you think shake things up a little
bit give you more options you know
to look at the AMD side as well as the
Intel side or if nothing else maybe the
Intel prices will come down a little bit
and you'll you'll see better options
there but I wouldn't I wouldn't concern
myself too much with the motherboard I
feel like if you're worried about
overclocking most motherboards that are
at least 115 plus dollars are fine
they're fine
yes they all will see just the same
unless you're doing ln2 or something
crazy if you like at a certain point
pass that it just becomes about
aesthetics yeah like they just spend
more like they put more fancy on
the heat sinks and things like that RGB
LEDs you gotta have that now obviously
if you are your compare to be fast that
is okay
there was a $20 donation from Jabbar I
know thank you very much for that Steve
he says those all yes I read all ken
that voice Steve loved your hybrid
builds great stuff yes guys check that
out it's Steve
he gets the hybrid liquid coolers like
Bullitt GP coolers the key PJ's and
stuff and they actually take them all
apart and lay all internal parts and
stuff like that's really cool
great stuff have you three received any
rise in CPUs for review yet can we
respect her can we expect a review when
the NDA is lifted February 28th which
we're not confirming it all by the way
that's what the question says really
torn between KP Lake build or risin
jabber I know I think we can all confirm
that we will be doing reviews and builds
win the NBA lifts beyond that we can't
really tell you anything further
hey I'll say on behalf of our site we
very generally well post product reviews
and news as embargoes lifts so hey you
got no specifics
yeah $5.00 from Robert Davis I need a
water going case okay suggestions for
water cooling cases something good
coming down the pipeline or down the
pipe love you guys tears as I drink an
IPA hmm water cooling cases I rather
like I'm kind of a fan Tex fanboy in a
way
yeah like fanboy fanboy but I really do
like their cases for custom water
cooling and some of my first built into
it and the end to evolve recently and
that's a really nice case I mean it is a
bit more expensive I think if you're
looking for a less expensive water
cooling case fractals options are really
good
yeah define ass define see even if you
want to do something a little bit
smaller part me I would take a look at
the tempered glass steps that's been
coming out because it's just all over
the place the tempered glass and I
really like tempered glass side panels
is over plexi they're a lot sturdier
sometimes they're a little bit more
cumbersome to get on and off and that
kind of thing but if you get a plexi
side panel and you know five minutes
later you got micro scratches on it like
it's impossible to not serger mess those
up in the least as you're doing a build
and if you're doing a water-cooled
builds like you're gonna want to look at
it right that's a big pretty big you
know I think factor for a lot of people
who are investing in a water-cooled
solution so you want to have you know
something presentational there side I
take a look at those and there's options
from Corsair and zx80 fans that
literally everybody yeah I mean when
they think I also take a look at their
even silverstone they're not normally
big on the Isleta yeah yeah there's none
to stuff yeah check those out I'd say
and and any other any other standout
cases for water cooler
I mean Thermaltake this big and liquid
cool and of course no yeah if you like
5p3 are nice it's very straightforward I
mean it's like a wall and like some
standoffs and then a glass in front base
already a test bench and you can mount
it into the wall if you want but in many
ways the bill yeah it's also a uniquely
third Thermaltake design case which I
always like right derived actually from
the level 10 case that they originally
did like years and years ago is one of
the first really high-end builts that we
did at nuoc TV really early on was the
ultimate build with the level 10 and
what they did with that when we're at
Newegg was they basically took the most
expensive part from every single
category and made me build a system with
it which is really cool to tiya except
for the look at the air cooler that they
chose was this really weird designed air
cooler so it's one that's like the base
plate goes on like that and then it has
this heat pipe array that goes up like
that and then an orb style thing like
this but it's this way and it costs like
a hundred bucks at the time for an air
cooler and it sucked like it really I
was like do I not know how to mount this
properly I remapped it like three times
but it was really miss not a good
performer and there was no like radiator
mounts in that case where there was an
air cooler like liquid cooling was not
close the cooler I didn't even exist
back then I don't think but I'm not
popular Lee yeah yeah so anyway I went
off on a tangent there but yeah the
Thermaltake p5 and t3 those are those
are pretty nice cases alright so what
else we get anyone else have anything
lined up ayuk leave a few fine dollars
from talk advances great show is always
guys where's the beer great show as
always yeah we were kind of lamenting
that fact as we were setting up but we
prioritized
actually streaming over getting beer for
the streams yeah we're going to a thing
just after this and they should have
some beer there so well as opposed to
paying like twelve bucks for a beer in
this hotel so we'll pour one out for you
guys yeah and and of course will drink
Steve's beer yeah
my ticket she's got a few minutes left
okay let's do a couple more here five
dollars from Sean Bray you guys give an
astounding amount of guidance to new
builders like myself I recently built a
new PC on Friday with the core i7 7700
ke me gaz 270 for the wind cake EVGA
1070 for the win with an 850 850 Evo 500
SSDs 100 sent with the help of pH you
know Paul's hardware that would videos
min RGB by the way that was the biggest
feature I think that EVGA was was
talking about what those m270 stuff was
no RGB LEDs it was actually really
refreshing yeah why not you can also
lack of RGB LED as a feature yeah that's
where we are right now I mean let's come
that far we're seeing the RGB push back
that is a really nice build though for
especially if it's if you're a new
builder or a specialist that's your
first time bill getting the raid
