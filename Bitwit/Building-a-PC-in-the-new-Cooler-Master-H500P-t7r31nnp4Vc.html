use an upgrade ooh
RGV and mechanical switches actually
their membrane switches with the tactile
click but what she doesn't know won't
hurt her
honey you must have spent a fortune not
even close
I'm not even mad at you for forgetting
our anniversary yesterday it's true I
did forget our anniversary but I more
than made up for it last night
not even close
the master set ms 120 is the latest RGB
mem Kanaka keyboard and mouse combo from
coolermaster and for you lefties out
there you can also snag the MS 121 with
an ambidextrous Mouse come October click
on the link in the description for more
info what's going on guys welcome back
to the channel hope you're all doing
well today I am building yet another
system this time in a brand new case
from the folks over at Coolermaster this
is the H 500 P and as a lot of you guys
already know this is sort of a throwback
to the original half series cases from
the same brand that were super popular
back in the day around the 2010s early
2010's era actually when I first started
getting into PC builds back then they
were all the rage half is of course
standing for high airflow and that's
sort of the philosophy behind these
cases is pushing and moving a lot of air
through the chassis in order to cool the
components effectively without
necessarily the use of any sort of
liquid so that's kind of cool
we're gonna be taking a look at this
brand new guy today very excited to be
testing it out
actually we won't be doing any hard
testing but I will be doing like i said
a physical build inside of it and
letting you guys know as i'm building in
real time what's working for me and
what's not as usual so first off let's
talk about the exterior because once I
get into the build itself I'm not really
gonna be focusing on the outside very
much but first off we've got sort of a
black and gray color scheme here all of
the gray accents that you see here
mainly for the top panel on the front
panel they're pretty much a plastic
construction that goes for the windows
as well it might look like tempered
glass at first but it is a tinted
plastic on the front and top and they do
remove quite easily so you want to be
sure not to accidentally pop one off
when you're trying to carry the case or
something like that bad things could
happen but there is plenty of
ventilation on the top and front as
well you can see that there's tons of
mesh the mesh is not superfine they also
that they act as a dust filter so when
it gets clogged up you just take it off
and take a can of compressed air and you
can dust off the air filtration or the
the mesh areas on both sides which seems
to work very nicely additionally you've
got tons of radio support first off
let's talk about those fans I mean
they're kind of hard to ignore you get a
pair of 200 millimeter RGB fans I
believe the case also comes with a
splitter so you can connect up to three
RGB devices to a single 5050 header on
your motherboard so that's kind of
really convenient additionally you can
fit a 360 radiator at the front or the
top you can also fit two hundred and
eighty millimeter radiators so any
combination of 120 s or 140 s should do
just fine so plenty of water cooling
support that's really nice to see and we
also do have a beautiful tempered glass
side panel you might notice that it is
also tinted very much like the plastic
front and top pieces but we don't have
the typical four corner screws like we
usually see on most of these cases with
tempered glass instead you get a single
screw in the middle that is not
removable it's actually something that
you just sort of twist yourself and well
actually this is you know what this is
one of the drawbacks to this design the
good thing is that you don't have to
deal with four screws it's just a single
screw the bad thing is that you need a
tool to do it's not fully toolless
unless you find a way to loosen this
maybe from the other side I tried
loosening it briefly it didn't really
work but I have a coin here and if you
turn the screw 90 degrees or so the
panel will fall down kinda like a
drawbridge but it you can see here it
sort of stops right right about there at
a pretty steep angle so it doesn't
accidentally hit the ground and shatter
or something like that so it's kind of
latched onto the bottom of the case and
kind of adds for a nice little catcher
right there and of course you can remove
it and you're gonna see me remove it
fully shortly but that is something to
be aware of and then you just kind of
turn it back into place and it pops on
perfectly so that's really cool you also
get a 140 millimeter included fan at the
back of the chassis as well it's not RGB
is just a standard black fan very color
neutral all around and let's see there's
also a dust filter for your power supply
removable dust filter it is not magnetic
just has that's on rail so you just
slide it out like so
Pop's in very easily seems high-quality
enough it is made of plastic the feets
elevation is pretty good too you get
probably I'd say an inch and a half an
inch and a half of space underneath your
case just for fresh air air intake for
your power supply specifically so that's
also nice to see nothing really on the
other side of the case it's just a
regular black steel side panel and
finally I guess I kind of overlooked it
at first but the front I oh we should
quickly mention we have a nice big power
button and right next to that a much
smaller kind of hard to press reset
button which is by design I think and
works very well I don't like my reset
buttons to be easily pressed and we also
have a pair of USB 3 and USB 2 ports so
you get four in total and your audio and
headphone jack at the front so that's
all nice and dandy but that's pretty
much gonna do it for the front I think
it's gonna be polarizing this is the
sort of aesthetic where whether or not
you like the cosmetic of this case
everyone's gonna have their own opinion
I think it's very much a love or hate
affair I personally am diggin it a lot I
really do like the look it's something
fresh and different but still pays
homage did the original half series
cases again my one critique or my few
critiques of the outside so far it's
just how easily these panels come off
with almost no resistance at all and the
fact that they are fully plastic not
that I'm gonna knock plastic 100% but I
would have liked to see for the MSRP of
a hundred and forty nine ninety nine us
maybe some aluminum integration or some
metallic materials being used instead of
fully plastic would have been the cherry
on top IMO but without further ado guys
let's go ahead and jump into the
interior of the case and start with our
assembly of a full I think we're doing a
rising bill we're doing a risin and
GeForce GTX 1080 ti system for today so
let's get building and see what this
case has to offer alright so I've got
the case on its side here we're gonna go
ahead and pop off the side panel again
using a coin so that comes off quite
easily give this a nice first look at
the internal layout here so a couple
things to note again we've got the
included 140 millimeter fan up to three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator
support at the top and the front and if
you do mount at the front you actually
have to remove or slide over this bottom
hard drive basement so
there's a hard dry basement cover and
the power supply basement cover they are
completely separate
they are modular as well um so that's
kind of nice it gives you the option if
you want to remove these completely you
could maybe potentially open up the
system for more airflow
that's kind of nice but yeah if you if
you put a 360 rat up here it's gonna go
down to the bottom of the case and it's
gonna force you to slide over this cover
as well as the hard drive cage that's
underneath it can support up to two
three and a half inch mechanical drives
that whole drive cage can be slided over
or can slide over to make room for front
mounted radiators we also get to SSD
mounts on top of the power supply
basement it's kind of nice we'll be
using those shortly and we'll show you
how the power supply mounting works as
well momentarily additionally we've got
this really nice cable management cover
which can be removed as well but it sort
of has the same basic style as the
outside of the case kind of this
industrial crossbar design so it's going
to cover up a lot of the cabling also
you've got this these three rubber
grommets for cable routing in their
appropriate places they're very large
wide open feel relatively high quality
through the only grommets in the case
though you don't get any at the top or
the bottom however there are two small
cutouts at the bottom of your case for
routing smaller front panel connectors
and things like that which is nice you
get two pre-installed standoffs I would
have liked to see you know the full
gamut of pre-installed standoffs just to
make the installation process a bit
quicker but you do get two they both
have little lips on them so it makes it
easier to mount the motherboard get it
situated but we are gonna have to mount
the rest in just a second here from the
looks of it you might also be able to
buy like an optical drive cage if you
wanted to mount it here because it looks
like there's perfectly just enough room
for two optical drives at the front five
and a quarter inch base probably could
be mounted here again along this rail
system that we have here of course there
are plenty of accessories that are
optional that you can buy into from
coolermaster themselves to sort of
customize and make the case your own as
they like to say so that's pretty cool
of course you would have to that would
require you removing this at least this
top 200 millimeter fan in order to do
that additionally they've included this
bracket this is a bracket if you wanted
to install say a 120 or 140 millimeter
fan at the top of the case in place of
that 200 millimeter unit you can
we'll do so with this bracket that
they've included with everything else so
that's cool I think on that note we're
gonna go ahead and quickly install the
standoffs they do give you a standoff
screwing tool with a Philips head
adapter that's handy okay so I've got
the motherboard standoffs installed went
in pretty easily there's something
interesting here though so we're
installing an e ATX motherboard by the
way this case supports up to e-atx mobos
which is super fantastic
however the motherboard that I'm using
which is the crosshair sticks from Asus
it's an AM four board has a hole for
mounting right here and it's it's marked
II am which means it's four e-atx ATX or
micro ATX and there should be a standoff
right here but instead it looks like
there's a screw coming in from the
opposite side of the motherboard tray so
I'm not exactly sure that must be
holding in the CPU cover bait plate
that's on the back that we'll take a
look at later but it looks like we won't
be able to actually install a standoff
where that is until further
investigations that's a little odd but
we're gonna go ahead and mount the board
in here because we've still got eight
stand-ups to work with that should be
plenty to hold this guy in place in case
you guys are curious we're using a risin
7 1700 cpu along with 16 gigs of corsair
dominator platinum ddr4 3200 megahertz
and that cooler is the is the cooler
master master air ma 610 p quite a
mouthful
so the motherboard is now installed
you'll notice that with EA TX
motherboards they actually cover up half
of the the rubber grommets so only about
50% of these grommets are showing now
you could still probably try to scrape
by and get the cables in there I don't
know about the 24 pin ATX it's kind of
thick for how much clearance is left
here but at the very least we should be
able to route them behind the cable
routing wall that's right here and it
should still mask the excess cabling
pretty well but we'll see alright so
I've got the case back right side up at
this point we can go ahead and start
installing our one SSD we've got a 960
gig HyperX savage
I'm good old Kingston so we're gonna use
I think I think I want to use one of
these guys we're gonna use one of the
SSD trays that's on top of the power
supply shroud so it removes
very easily with just a single thumb
screw it is a textured thumb screw makes
it very easy to twist
however straight from the factory right
out of the box you're going to need a
Philips head screwdriver to help you
with that
they are pretty tight when you first get
the case and the way this sort of works
is you just slot the SSD in like so and
it's kind of a an incognito mounting
solution because you can't really see
the SSD once it's installed which is
either gonna be loved or hated by fans
everywhere by builders everywhere
because some people really want to show
off their SSDs that's part of the fun
other people you know buy really ugly
SSDs and want to hide it for all intents
and purposes I think it's good I think
it's a good thing that they're they're
kind of blacking it out and that it's
more covert I actually kind of like that
blacked out theme so we're gonna just
screw this SSD in with four screws
alright so we've got the SSD installed
into the little tray here say the ports
are facing towards the motherboard
towards the back of the case we have a
very large cutout on the power supply
basement it seems to reroute any SATA
power and data cables to your drives
just pretty sweet and then let's go
ahead and plug that guy right back in
and just screw in the thumb screw voila
SSD installation complete apart from the
two cables that we need to connect to it
still okay so if you want to install our
power supply now we obviously have to
remove the power supply shroud that's
right here because there's just not
enough clearance behind the motherboard
tray to get the power supply in that way
nor is there any option of you inserting
it from behind the case so in order to
remove this power supply shroud however
you first have to remove the hard drive
shroud that's towards the front of the
case that's because the hard drive
shroud is slightly overlapping and kind
of see it's sort of overlapping the
power supply shroud which which is an
interesting move because now we have to
remove this guy but it gets even better
before we can remove the hard drive
shroud we now we have to remove the
cable management cover that's behind the
tray behind the motherboard tray so we
actually have to remove this guy to even
access or to remove the the hard drive
tray so
not the most convenient kind of an
interesting design choice especially
because there's no tempered glass on
this side panel guys remember it's just
a regular piece of sheet metal so when
all is said and done and you're done
with your build you can't even see this
side of the case anyway all your cables
are masked in the very end so I'm not
exactly sure why you need a cover
underneath another cover especially if
that is gonna make the power supply
installation more difficult seems a bit
counterintuitive to me but I don't know
maybe you guys have some some of your
own opinions that you can formulate in
the comments below about this
interesting add on to the back side of
the case so we've got these two screws
that hold the cable management cover in
place it kind of swings out like this
it's just on some hinges just removes
like so steel construction very sturdy
it'll be good for at least a you know
sturdy when clamping down your cables
you can see some front panel connectors
here and that'll give us access to not
that screw this screw right here is one
screw at the back this is one of the
screws one of the two screws that's
holding in that hard drive cover that
hard drive basement cover if I flip the
case around boom we can now draw our
attention to the bottom of the case here
there's a screw there's that second
screw holding in the hard drive cage a
hard drive cover I should say and that
screw is not magnetic so it does not
come along with me but that pops out
just like so and here you can sort of
see what I was talking about earlier
we've got the hard drive cage that has
two trays for mechanical drives I
believe you can also mount SSD said that
so that's nice you can also remove this
hard drive cage and slide it over to the
left towards the back of the case to
make more room for front mounted
radiators so that seems to be working
pretty pretty nicely but moving on to
our power supply we've got two screws at
the bottom here we've also got two
screws in the back I actually removed
one of them already so I only have one
more to do here
but that's two four six eight we had we
had to remove eight screws just to start
mounting our power supply so
I don't know that's not gonna bother
some of you I think it's it's a little
much for me a little much for my taste
oh let's make that nine screws because
there's also one screw behind the
motherboard tray one last screw holding
in that power supply shroud now we
should be able to remove the shroud
without issue there we go
all right now we've got a nice open area
to install our power supply so give me
one moment I will BRB
all right power supply is going in we've
got a 650 watt g2 from good ol EVGA slot
that in like so also gonna take all the
cables with me and pull them through the
back of the case and at this point this
is more or less a standard mounting
procedure for power supplies we've got
our four screws in the back that need to
go in should also mention that there are
rubber pads at the bottom of the case so
it will help reduce noise and vibration
for your power supply so this point we
can just start popping on our covers
again alright so back on with the power
supply shroud it's very well machined at
the very least I can definitely say that
the holes line up when you're trying to
screw things in you don't have to sort
of force adjust any of the pieces to get
this screws threaded also another bonus
all the screws that you're seeing me use
right now are the same so you don't have
to dig through to find out which screws
go where they're all identical okay and
we're gonna leave this cover off for now
since we still have to do a bunch of
cable management back here so on that
note I think the only components help
this thing I swear just look at look at
how easy it pops off why why does it do
that alright so the last component we
have to install is the graphics card but
before we do that I'm gonna do some some
wiring here do some cable management
just get our our main essentials
connected let's see with an e ATX
motherboard can we
it through the grommet it does fit
through the grommet even 24-pin seems to
fit but is it comfortable that is the
other question is if any comfortable you
know what it's not it's a little it's a
little too tight for my liking so I'm
gonna actually just route it through
from underneath the roof the grommets
also seem to pop out quite easily so be
aware of that
I'll see you can I kick you connect it
from the side of the motherboard alright
that's a connection beautiful and it
looks pretty clean I mean from what I
can tell you can't really see too much
of that 24 pin it's almost like you
don't want extensions really or
extensions wouldn't be very valuable in
the case like this where at least if
you're using the e ATX motherboard where
you're really only seeing maybe half an
inch of the cable at least for your 24
pin now you can see my fingers poking
out here we've got two entryways at the
top of the motherboard for routing more
cables such as your CPU your eight pin
DPS in most cases cable that's solid so
this is interesting as I'm trying to
route the SATA power cable to our SSD up
here at first I was like oh use one of
the small openings that's at the bottom
of the motherboard but apparently with
an e ATX motherboard or perhaps this is
the case with any ATX motherboard as
well it kind of covers up those holes so
fortunately there's still one giant
cutout on the power supply basement
itself to put the power supply shroud so
we can actually let's see if we can get
it up through there oh it looks like
looks like you can this would have been
much easier had I plugged it in before
mounting it to the basement but that's
that would have been too easy so that
looks good let me get a say the cable
BRB come on yep come on you oh jeez
the right angle say the plugs are not
doing well and it looks like well the
SSD is actually upside down when you
mount it to these trays so you'll have
to also bear in mind to plug in the
cables upside down as well I'm gonna
undo this really briefly just to get it
plugged in like so okay SSD is now fully
installed
all right GPU installation you get a
couple options here in the H 500 P the
first of which is just a regular
orientation slot straight on to the
motherboard in its horizontal
positioning or you can do a vertical GPU
mount you can see that we actually have
a two slot option here so dual slot
cards are supported if you wanted to
mount the GPU somewhat like so with the
fans facing the side panel window of
course that might mitigate some of the
airflow that is that the cards receiving
of course will have to do some AV
comparison testing to validate that
however the PCI riser card that's
required to actually utilize this
function is not included with the case
which i think is kind of a kind of a
bummer especially if you're paying $150
for the case like throw in the riser
card I feel like this is like DLC for a
case it doesn't rub me the right way
entirely but that option is available to
you if you want to add a little bit of
extra cost to the overall case purchase
for now since we don't have that
accessory we're gonna be mounting it the
old pleb way going tradition now so
pretty basic here we do get some some
screws they are not thumb screws for
some odd reason I don't understand why
perhaps it's to not cause interference
with the GPU the vertical GPU mounts but
I still think they could have I still
would work
I think that's necessarily the issue
again there's some some things about
this case than like hmm I don't know
considering the price point that's a
thing like you can charge more for a
case but people will expect more for
that price as well and it looks like we
should just be able to slot it in here
like so
uh-huh as you can see I've also routed
my eye PCIe cables through the one of
the grommets there towards the bottom we
only have a six pin in an eight pin we
actually need two eight pin plugs for a
gtx 980ti here it's an EVGA ACX for the
win three a very high-end card but we
are short one VGA cable so excuse me one
moment
GPU installed so at this point I say we
dive into some cable management I've
already started a little bit at the back
you can see it's not a complete disaster
but we've got plenty of options here
there's lots of tie-down points you can
see that we've got several at the top
going down on the right side of the
grommet there's even the couple in
between and definitely some above the
power supply as well there's also this
this cover here this cover for your CPU
plate so if you just want to mask off
the the backplate of your motherboard
and your CPU cooler you can do so of
course this is removable so if you don't
like it here if you want additional room
for cable management not that much
cabling happens in this area behind the
motherboard tray anyway but if you did
you could remove it and leave it removed
for your build it's totally up to you
additionally I just learned that I made
a mistake earlier I mentioned that these
two holes right here were cable routing
holes when in fact they are not they're
actually grooves so that if you wanted
to reposition one of the SSD trays to
the back of your case behind the
motherboard tray you could do so and
that's why we have these two threaded
holes here is that you can actually
mount those two SSDs behind your
motherboard if you so choose so forgive
me Coolermaster and viewers these are
not it's not the fact that your cable
your motherboard is covering up these
holes for cable routing they are in fact
meant for the SSDs so that's been
cleared up that's good let's proceed to
tying these guys down of course we have
the power supply basement and hard drive
basement to help us stash any excess
cabling down below out of sight and out
of mind
so I've got our RGB fans at the front of
the case already connected to this three
device splitter and we actually have
room for a third one if we wanted to
connect one but we actually don't we're
actually good with just the two so I'm
gonna connect the end of that to a 50/50
header on our motherboard and we've just
got a ton of cables here that we can
start a zip tying I should also mention
you get a ton of cable management
specifically in this region right behind
the the cable cover here you get
probably about an inch to an inch and a
half of cable routing space definitely
an inch and a half there's a lot of
space back here very generous
now I'm curious there's gonna be any
cable interference here it looks like
there's just barely enough space between
the motherboard tray and this cable
cover for small like fan sized cables to
fit through so they don't all have to be
routed 100% above or below the cable
routing tray and I do now see some
benefit to this cable cover and it's
mainly so that you have an easier time
replacing your side panel after all your
cable management's done because it does
help clamp all of it down and flatten it
go alright you know that sweet and then
I don't know where this guy should go
oh he fits perfectly right there maybe
in the future because this is looking
really nice I mean there's hardly any
cables visible once you put on this huge
cover which looks fantastic it's just
kind of a shame that you can't see it
you can't see how invisible the cables
are once the side panels on maybe a
tempered glass dual tempered glass on a
future revision might be something to
consider Coolermaster I'd get behind
that
so I mean voila I mean holy crap that's
that's cable management in the H 500 P
it has a very high what I like to call a
git factor but that's what I caught they
said this case has a very high factor
where you literally don't have to worry
too much about where the cables are
going especially without a tempered
glass side panel on this side of the
case and these cable covers plenty of
tie down points and a cable management
basement or a power supply basement I
should say all those things add up to be
a to make a very easy cable management
experience that most people whether
you're a novice or an advanced PC
builder are going to enjoy and
appreciate so let's so let's turn this
guy around so we can get a fuller shot
all right build complete looking pretty
good I might add really 11 those two 100
and I'm sorry two hundred millimeter
fans at the front they look absolutely
fantastic especially with the RGB I
actually hook it up to the little
controller that came with this CPU
cooler since we don't have an OS or any
software installed yet but just so you
guys can take a look okay look guys
watch whoo they're different colors
taste the rainbow and all that jazz
ain't that fancy let's let's do uh let's
do some feeling some blue sounds no
let's do some purple is that purple or
pink that's purple all right purple
looks good but yes every everything went
pretty smoothly in here some things that
I really like about the case are the SSD
mounts I think the versatility there is
fantastic being able to mount them
behind the motherboard tray I also
forgot to mention you can mount one of
these directly on top of the hard drive
cage for even more versatility I also
like the fact that the power supply
shroud is a separate piece from the
front hard drive shroud and how you can
remove each of those individually
however I think that also does limits
the ease of use for your power supply
installation it makes that process a
little bit more time-consuming having to
remove so many screws including that
cable management cover that's the back
of the case which I'm still sort of on
the fence about I don't think it's a
hundred percent necessary although some
of you guys might might absolutely love
it I'm actually gonna be leaving it out
of the system overall I just don't think
I need it very much and then
additionally cable management in here
apart from that weird cover is fantastic
I mean you really have to worry about it
whether you're advanced or an
intermediate or a novice builder you
should have no problem tucking away any
excess cabling you've got a lot going
for you all those tied on points the
covers the basement covers and that's or
thing additionally I think the the top
panel specifically and also the front
panel but mostly the top panel are just
way too loose and just the fact that you
can easily pop it off makes it seem a
little bit cheaper than it really is
it's not low quality or anything but the
fact that it's so loose makes you think
that so they might want to fix that on a
future revision I do like the fact that
there's so much water cooling support in
here makes me really wish that I had an
AO to actually test out the mounts
although it's pretty straightforward you
get plenty of flexible mounting strips
at the top and the front so tons of
water cooling support there the option
to have a vertical amount of GPU is fan
is great and I appreciate that however
the fact that it doesn't include a PCI
riser card to do so out of the box is
kind of a disappointment for the 150
dollar price tag and since the original
half series of cases came out back in
the day $100.00 cases have come a long
way and for a hundred bucks you can get
pretty much 80 to 85% of the features
that you're getting with the H 500 P so
whether or not that additional $50 is
worth that 15% of added features is 100%
up to you you're gonna at the end of the
day you have to determine whether or not
it is worth the added cost but overall I
like the case I think it's a great Buy
I also really enjoy the way it looks
that's gonna be a huge subjective thing
if you don't like the way it looks and
that's a pretty easy decision for you
guys there but overall let me know what
you think in the comments below and
that's pretty much gonna do it for now
