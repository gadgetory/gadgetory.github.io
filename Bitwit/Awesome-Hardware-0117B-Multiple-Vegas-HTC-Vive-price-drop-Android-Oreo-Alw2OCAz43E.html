you know just have a moment of silence
right when we start just to just to
create that more raw feeling you know
some people like wow it's so live it's
like it's actually happening it's really
happening you know they don't even know
that they're streaming right now what if
what if they do something embarrassing
it's not just an advanced computer
algorithm we are real people welcome
welcome welcome welcome everybody to the
show this is side-b awesome Hardware
episode 117 amazing that we've lasted
this long this is a tech news show more
or less that Paul and I like to do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware or if you're watching this on
youtube we stream the show into two
halves on our respective YouTube
channels this week the first half of the
show was on Paul's channel which is
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware you
can find the link to that in the
description of my YouTube video down
below and then now we're on SCI beat so
we're taking about the the baton has
been passed on to me I shall carry on
carry the rest of us into the second
half of the show where there will be
much fun excitement drinking and and and
happiness and joy I'm just gonna end
fudge say no more
alright let's uh let's turn it into sell
you stuff go to our stores buy things my
store is biblioth√®que slash store I'm
currently having no sales so so so act
fast everything is full price act now
everything is full price this doesn't
happen often folks
so please buy everything now that you
see including the fidgets spinners the
new hats that are on sale there's a new
limited edition bit wit t-shirt that's
in a navy color it's it's very it's very
awesome and then and then you can also
go to Paul's store which is a Paul's
hardware net he's also selling lots of
shirts hoodies beanies glasses polo
shirts polo shirts my women's shirts
mugs do it do it buy all the things
domestic shipping is now a bit cheaper
than it used to be so shipping steered
you away the first time then it should
be
fudge is very distracting I'm just gonna
say right now I'm probably gonna be able
to focus very well in this half because
Paul's gonna be eating fudge the whole
time and I'm a little joke one piece
jelly I need that's okay um just taste
let's let's kick it off with some tech
news shall we um this isn't really tech
news this is more like space news but
but let's talk about the solar eclipse
oh yeah you know what screw talking
about it we've talked about it long
enough now that it has already come now
that it is passed
why don't we look at it because I know
if you're like me you probably didn't
get a chance at all to see the you know
phenomenon that was the solar eclipse of
2017 um I was driving I wifey sauce and
I were on our way back from our little
vacation thing we were on the freeway
driving in LA traffic when the Eclipse
went down so we didn't really see
Plus even if we were like laying down
somewhere in LA you can't really see
much of it there anyway but a lot of
people did and a lot of people took
really good awesome professional photos
of it so here's some really cool and
with this based a really cool imagery of
the space station it's a composite image
so it's taking a different time
intervals you can sort of see it
traveling across the way there and a big
beautiful Sun a little bit of you know
moon trying to try to creep in moon
repeat moon Moon's get a little handsy
creeping you know encroaching on the
sun's personal space and then we got the
full total eclipse where this is just he
just looks dirty just looks dirty it
looks like a black hole
it is a black hole by definition it's a
black hole it's big it's big yeah thank
you okay it's a hole blackness at least
that's what my I see but no space space
wise it is not a black hole and then
there's a really cool composite image
showing the progress
of a total solar solar eclipse I like
these this isn't Oregon cool it's very
cool gives you an idea of sort of just
the transgression or the of what's of
what's going on what actually happens I
got the scoreboard right there so you
can see if the Eclipse is winning yep it
looks like it is it's a it's a stomping
stomping victory 0 to 46 I'm not sure
who the Eclipse is competing again I'm
that's the time left scores actually
tied 0-0 oh wow
this further proves that I do not know
how to read scoreboards who look at the
diamond ring ooh
diamond ring what's that oh yeah diamond
ring diamond ring is what they call the
effect when the Sun is either about to
disappear or has just reappeared uh-huh
and just one part of it is peeking out
around the edge when it creates this
kind of effect of the diamond ring this
is a little bit more exaggerated it's
out a little bit more when it's just
barely peeking you just see it you just
see that one flare like right at the
edge of the circle I see ya watching
NASA feed and that's all the kiss the
diamond ring I love saying diamond ring
it makes me feel smart and then a total
solar eclipse okay from a little plane
Wow I'm sure there was some great you
know airborne plane Instagram pics of
the Eclipse did you see that was cool
did you see the jib the Jif one I didn't
see the Jif there's a really cool one of
it going across the plane so it's a it's
it's shot out of a plane window and the
planes going across and you can see the
Sun and then there's just this looks
like blackness that like darkness thick
because it's go in there and the plane
goes into it and suddenly the Sun goes
dark because they go they go into the
area of the Eclipse and they leave it
and then they're in it for like you know
10 or 15 seconds and then they leave it
in then the sudden it's ready it is
pretty cool that's perspective bro
that's pretty cool
this is a trippy ass picture I mean
there's a lot of tribute pictures here
guys look at all the pictures look at
all of them do if you're smart you'll
take a picture of one of these pictures
with your phone and post it on the
internet as your own and probably like
this this is a picture of the shadow on
the earth Oh
that is pretty cool that's sweet shadowy
alright nice article there hopefully you
guys had a fun solar eclipse viewing if
you didn't then you can wait again until
the next one which is also lady gaga
oh that's lady gaga I was like who's
this random woman that's Lady gaga
just chilling she looks like she's not
really to be one of the people at the
top of that and an Independence Day you
know nevermind it's been a while since
I've seen it actually I don't think I've
ever seen Independence Day what yeah no
that's like one of the movies that like
I like that's my guilty like that never
saw that one never saw that one alright
really
yeah we should do like an independent
state viewing one of these days fun
movie to watch I'm sure I like Will
Smith these old Will Smith yeah pretty
awesome
I liked men in black he's little bit
it's Will Smith in prime form - yeah I
Robot that alright it's a good
we'll get around to it it's a good movie
alright let's move on to our next story
here this one's a bit more techy this is
about our ex Vega having apparently
three or four Vega 10 variants this is
an article from
videocards comm reporting on an article
by Tom's Hardware according to Tom's
Hardware
there's at least three variants of Vega
ten coming from different factories that
are equipped that are equipped with
different memory chips and
configurations the main difference is
the lack of molding on the non resin
variant which makes it harder to use for
custom designs since the GPU is 40 micro
meters higher than the HBM two modules
the molded and unmolded molded and
unmolded designs have a point one point
one millimeter difference in GP light
and tom's hardware is claiming that the
board partners now have to experiment
with different screw lengths to ensure
that there are no overheating issues so
0.1 millimeters for most of us doesn't
seem like much of an issue but it can
actually impose some serious heating
problems yes not addressed properly
a significant difference in the amount
of torque exactly I mean this is this is
really tricky because the the GPU cooler
is also attached pressure to the to the
vrm area right so so being misaligned in
one section means the cooler is also
misaligned elsewhere so this is a very
sort of thing that the admin board
partners have to finesse aimed AMD is
actually released a special presentation
to the board partners explaining the
difference between these Vega variants
so hopefully the communication between
AMD and the ad board partners is clear
and the board partners get it right and
we don't see a bunch of you know custom
Vega cards shipping with overheating
issues because of 0.1 millimeter
difference in GPU height between these
Vega 10 variants um let's let's hope for
the best there also there appears to be
a potential Vega 56 variant that you
know that that also needs to be
accounted for so I don't know has it has
this happened before I'm not sure before
yes um what I can't I can't recall
anything recent but there's a good
example that I can't I can't bring some
ID right now um but yeah I mean I mean
any time that you have different
products coming from different factors
there's bound to be some variance
between them but when it comes to
something as as important as like Z
height yeah with a very delicate things
like it's like a GPU die and HBM stack
HBM two stacks that's that's a challenge
that I am glad I am NOT a additive or
manufacturer engineer that I have to
deal with it's true that kind of sucks
it's incredibly precise
yeah so you have to error like you'd
have to make sure like if you're in an
ASIS or something like that it's like I
would want to be absolutely sure that
all of the Vega chips I was getting came
from the same place yeah so I can be
assured of very yeah just just make sure
that they're all the same it's gonna
make it much harder for the Adhan board
partners which I mean there's no mention
of this but hopefully it doesn't delay
the custom board variants because they
now have to create sort of different I
don't know if they would be molds or
what they would be but you know they
have to excuse me they feel account for
these variances between the various big
attend chips so that that's that sucks
that sucks for them it seems like
they've got their work cut out for him
but hopefully it all goes smoothly we
wish you well and we're partners let's
talk about our next article here which
is about the HTC vive dropping in price
by two hundo yeah two hundo dollars off
at $5.99 the original price being 800 at
launch which is what both me and Paul
Paul and I paid for it
now it's $600 if only we had waited turn
two years or whatever to buy the HTC
vive if we weren't just stupid early
adopters we could have got it for way
cheaper Paul but such as the way it goes
when you're an early adopter so 200
bucks off the original price that's
that's that's a hefty discount all
things considered it includes it also
includes a free trial - vive port so
that you get a vine subscription which
is kind of like VR steam in a way from
what I'm reading
but there's additional perks here within
the subscription you can choose up to
five titles per month to to to
experience so you know there's a lot of
like little fun fun VR games that you
just there's not much information on
them yet there's still very much like
they're sort of an indie feel almost in
cigars alright almost an undeveloped
feel to them in a way which some people
love other people are like and this
doesn't feel like a full game so
apparently with a vibe port subscription
you can choose up to five titles per
month to try out there are also a few
included games with the new $600 price
including tilt brush Everest VR and
Ritchie's plank experience HTC has also
noted that there is more triple-a
content
coming in the likes for the likes of our
users here including fallout 4 VR and
doom VFR and more more to come
that's fun I think doom VR would be
pretty sweet and I think that's probably
one of the other big things besides
price that's holding back VR from
becoming sort of a mainstream platform I
think that it's it's a lot to ask users
to buy into this piece of hardware that
costs hundreds of dollars six to eight
hundred dollar even six hundred dollars
is still steep for most people on top of
a gaming system on top of $1,000 plus
gaming machine that's required to run
these HMDs and the headsets properly
that's a lot to ask for for users I mean
for PC users I mean we have to realize
we're a small niche a niche and it's
easy for us to just be like well we can
just build the system that's that sounds
like fun
but for most people who are just regular
gamers who aren't into pcs that's that's
a that's a high barrier to entry I feel
is like okay now I either have to like
go out and buy a pre a prebuilt $1,000
ish process PC or I have to build it
myself which is an even more daunting
proposition for a lot of people not for
us but for a lot of people so that could
be one of the barrier that's definitely
one of the barriers to entry for VR
right now on top of price and I think
HTC is seeing this they need like a
Super Mario World for VR they need it
they need a title that you can only play
in VR that's like an exclusive it's like
awesome they need an amazing exclusive
and I think the other the other the
other thing preventing this from really
taking off apart from the price that I
was gonna say is the content itself
because I feel like VR is very much
experience all and once you've
experienced it however I mean it's it's
it's unlike anything you've ever tried
once you try it you're like oh my god
it's amazing but like all things in life
the novelty of anything wears off pretty
quickly I mean you spend the first three
hours in VR are like it's like peer
heaven amazing you know spiritual and
 and then like two days later you're
like okay
give me give me something else like the
graphics and then then you start to
point out things that that could be
improved right like the graphics could
be a little bit better you know I'm
still just like slaying zombies or
whatever I'm shooting zombies for like
hours on end
give me some triple-a content that's the
other thing holding VR back at this
point I feel is is the Triple A
experience and NH EC is obviously aware
of that with fallout 4 and doom dr doom
VR on the horizon player enum
battlegrounds VR star citizen VR Silent
Hill VR yeah I mean all just take all
the big games if all of the big games
right now if all the big games today
that you're that you're naming off right
now that VR had VR support I guarantee
you that these headsets would sell a lot
more and I invite HTC probably wouldn't
have to drop the price so much on their
vibe so I think it's just you know I
think everyone's really quick to judge
VR because it's still so early on in its
infancy there there's like oh they're
not selling the units are they lower the
price it's because it's jack-shit just a
fad it's it's you know it's just just a
trend and it's gonna be everyone's gonna
forget about VR in a year or two I don't
think that's necessarily the case I
think it's it's just not ready it hasn't
matured fully just like a lot of people
are saying that you know like Zen like
the Zen architecture hasn't matured
fully in some ways there's there's some
similarities there and eventually we're
gonna start to see more triple-a content
probably appeal to the masses a bit more
and there's gonna be a higher demand for
VR that's that's my opinion of it but it
is nice to see
HTC swallowing their pride a little bit
I mean you know and taking a pay cut
dropping it to $600 then again they
might not be selling many units right
now so it could be more of like a
survival necessary thing a necessity you
know if budget is a consideration then
the rift is definitely cheaper so the
rift is but now three four hundred four
hundred warded yep it is two hundred
steeper that is true and they both offer
room scale at this point so
choose your weapon but we'll keep a
close eye on this on this VR business
have you have you played your VR
recently at all I tore down the HTPC and
the living room so it's not set up but
I've actually been kind of itching to
get it set back up again because I can't
want it jump back and do it
Elsa likes your thing with like VR
workout kind of thing like a V yeah I
mean like take a different angle on it
yeah you know like what's what's
something unique about VR that you
really couldn't do with regular PC
gaming and physical exercise seem to be
an obvious choice so it was a bit of an
experimental thing but yeah I mean
definitely it's an evolving platform and
I'm pretty I'm looking forward to seeing
where it goes but let's move on to our
next story here is about android 8.0 8.0
Ryo but what happened Android Android
8.0 is called Oreo so we had nougat
haters we had Nugget with the N and now
we're on Oh what happens when they get
to Z what Zed Zed then they just they
just go back to a but they use a
different a different different word
different candy different sweet thing
maybe they go into numbers I'll really
start doing fruits avocado you know like
they're kind of making out like maybe
eventually people will get so triggered
in today's society of being super
triggered about everything
people yea injured and googly promoting
unhealthy foods all the vegans knee and
then they'll be like an animal you know
a lot of turnover it'll be lawsuits all
right a is now avocado bees banana seize
your
you know whatever I've digressed
immensely off of this topic we're
talking about Oreo Oreos are delicious
and it's also the name of Android's
newest OS 8.0 hell yeah Oreos are vegan
I think Oreos are definitely vegan there
that's true I think they are I think I
remember reading that somewhere
probably my Jean white powder lard and
sugar right oh if it has lard then
they're definitely not vegan that's what
the filling is made of is it this large
and sugar really yeah
oh well then they're not vegan I mean
maybe I couldn't either all right that
could be wrong Oreo is vegan maybe it's
like a vegetable large it could be it
that's it that's the thing right we'll
see Oreos might be like so processed
that they don't even contain like
natural well it's like it might have
been like go full circle it's
potentially was an animal but it was
reduce bar removed from being an animal
yeah you can't really classify it as
that anymore it's the most so there we
go
all right um Oreos are the trademark
vegan cookie all right that's fine so
apparently Android and Google has struck
up a deal with Nabisco who is the you
know company who makes Oreos just like
the one with Nestle
when they did KitKat right so all right
smart smart corporate tie-ins thinking
thinking so here are some some new
features of the new OS which I'll just
rattle off really quick longer battery
life yes we all want that there's a new
background limits background limitations
feature that keeps the apps from running
in the background to lower the power
consumption overall there's an all new
notifications channels framework which
gives users more custom controls over
notifications and how you receive them
which is awesome I feel like
notifications definitely need to be
worked on for the last revision of
Android there's an option to now choose
the icon shapes I didn't realize this
was an issue to begin with I was
perfectly fine with set of circles
circular or what else can you do the
hexagon the skwerkel a squirrel is what
was listed in the article which was a
half breed between a circle and a square
which just sounds to me like a square
with rounded edges yeah rounded I don't
let's see you don't need to make up a
skwerkel let's know stupid word is
dumped it just call it a square with
rounded edges why don't you make a stars
we'll make a star or triangle or
trapezoid of some sort that would quad
qualify
but no skwerkel business I'm sorry I'm
just not for it I'm gonna get hired at
Google and I'm gonna read it I'm Everett
write a memo about house quark holders
did this squiggles fire the score cool
person yeah there's also get fired
yeah work okay I want a rant on Twitter
call out everyone tell you the truth
about squirrels that Google fired me
okay leading into a parody video so it's
also gonna have support for autofill
apps giving users the ability to choose
an auto-fill app that will become the
default filler I don't know what that
means wait what the ability it'll give
users the ability to choose an auto-fill
app that'll become the default filler
maybe how they use them on any boards I
want an auto-fill app that's made by
urbandictionary.com so automatically
like all the bad words that you have to
like type out and I just like maybe make
this not bad word you're not no I meant
to say right there like I wanted to
say yep like Monroe transfer yeah you
know exactly so it would immediately
know that you're the second dimension
individual I don't fill that stuff for
you I'm down for that yeah I'm totally
down for that too
and you're right you're totally right
Urban Dictionary would be my would be my
autofill out for everything
yeah picture-in-picture mode is just
kind of cool you can shrink down your
YouTube video into a separate little
window so it's still playing there does
that well YouTube app does oh yeah if
you have read yeah that's what's gonna
say if you have YouTube breath it's not
a problem but for all of us plebs don't
you don't have read I do I was trying to
be turned a half of the voice of the
people
Paul I'm about to sign up for a second
read subscription why why do you need to
why would you need to read subscriptions
because I have I have an account for my
month for my YouTube channel and that's
what I have the red subscription on but
more frequently I use just my personal
account that's that's that they're
separate so it would be nice to have
read on my personal account - well you
just log into your YouTube account
on your phone right because I don't know
because I don't want to log into my
YouTube account like everywhere and I
want to have a bunch of logins like all
over the place for that where do you
need to access YouTube bread from mainly
my htpc I guess is the place where it
pops up where I'm like I'd like to be
logged in there but I'd like it if this
wasn't also logged in so maybe you to my
YouTube account right this is the living
room kind of more private I mean also
it's like I'm I I make my living off of
YouTube so it feels like it's okay for
me to pay 20 bucks a month for you to
grid like I yeah I don't know it seemed
I seem like I feel like I'd be okay with
that yeah that make sense
fair enough okay fair enough all right
you'll also get things like multi
display so you can launch an app onto
another display that's connected which
is pretty cool smart text selection
feature machine learning is involved
here machine learning will recognize
specific text like addresses phone
numbers or passwords
hopefully not passwords and it'll
suggest an app that complies with it so
if you if you see like if there's an
address it'll suggest Google Maps would
you like to open this up in Google Maps
or if it's a phone number
it'll suggest contacts would you like to
add a new contact and so forth you will
also have enhanced Bluetooth audio
codecs for higher performance lower
latency and that sort of thing Google
Play protection program which is a
system that keeps device the device is
safe from malicious apps it scans over
50 billion apps a day to ensure ultimate
safety for Android users so we're all
protected and most importantly them most
importantly the most important addition
to Android Oreo is going to be that we
have now new emojis
o-obviously is there an Oreo emoji
they're freaking better be I mean I
if I'm gonna sign a multi-million dollar
deal with Nabisco I better get a damn
Oreo emoji just saying although we
haven't really we've been getting like a
nougat emoji did we
was there a nugget nougat or a KitKat
emoji I don't think so I know it's Oreo
seems like these
to do I mean I got this pure circle
I want that emoji I want I want to be
able to send that emoji to everyone
the little transformer Oreo Android dude
pops out of the Oreo this little spin
move everyone should get one of those we
should be able to I don't know why he's
Asian I know why all of a sudden he's
cuz there's nothing that something it's
something an asian would do no it's
totally not it's positive race I
completely agree
okay I could not imagine any other race
doing that all right so congrats Android
and Google for Oreo we're all looking
forward to it I should also mention
lastly because this applies to us
specifically the rollout for the new OS
will probably be rolling out to pixel
and pixel Excel users first day pixels
shortly followed by Nexus and less
lesser inferior inferior yep all right
let's move on to our next story here the
SNES Super Nintendo now we're good we're
gonna be here thank you the SNES mini is
coming this is an article from TechRadar
let's not forget how everyone's already
gone Cal I know right has even gone on
sale you already know I'm gonna force
pre-order that today Oh pre-order yes
they're gone they're gone so let's just
rub it in your faces anyone who didn't
get one including myself just how
awesome this little unit is let's not
forget that everyone lost their minds
last year when the NES classic came out
and now we have the successor to that
this Super Nintendo system from from
Nintendo and this is pretty cool it
comes with the console itself two
controllers with generous cable length
that was an issue with the NES classic
is that they only had 30 inch long
cables which basically meant you had to
have the console pretty much under your
nose the whole time which sucks
they are now extended to 56 inches much
more generous and savestates are back so
you can save your game
there's a four savestates on the console
there's also a cool rewind feature which
allows you to rewind the game play the
game play 45 up to 45 seconds so if
you'd like die you can just like keep
her winding and have like almost like
infinite replay
you know infinite lives or whatever
which is kind of cool
there's also optional filters so you can
smooth out the pixel edges cuz that's
the thing is like HD with HD TVs these
days it makes the old-school pixelated
look look even worse because it's just
so fine and clear and defined the old
CRT monitors kind of created this
natural mmm
softening around the pixels so that it
just sort of looked looked a little bit
nicer so there's a filter for that now
and also you know there's a filter for
like creating scan lines if you want
that more authentic look according to
the review on TechRadar you have to
physically press the reset button on the
console every time you want to switch
games which they didn't really like that
would be kind of annoying and the
console itself is limited to the 21
built-in games so they did go on to say
though the 21 games that are offered are
pretty reflective of like they're all
classics basically they're all it's like
a really good lineup it's a good
selection of games and and one of the
games is actually a never before
released game it's a Star Fox 2 which
was in development and pretty much got
finished back in the day but never
actually came to market because it kind
of came at the end the tail end of the
console lives the consoles life and
Nintendo at that point had already
decided to start working on Nintendo 64
stuff and so Star Fox 2 never actually
became a thing so if you're like a piss
like a historical if you're super into
like historic gaming and stuff like that
that's a really cool value add I can see
that being valuable to a lot of people
collectors and stuff and it just looks
looks like a nice little console - for
80 bucks 80 bucks that's it's a good
deal I think I guess I think that's
reasonable HDMI out of course to
complete
with modern television sets and the unit
will launch September 29th of this year
like Paul said it's gone in pre-order
they're already out so prepared to pay a
lot more than 80 bucks for one on a
third-party reseller website like eBay
or something like that from price
gouging assholes or just from yeah from
price gouging assholes that's pretty
much it
you said Star Fox 2 I thought that could
also be like the name of like a furry
porno I will be I mean I will not look
that up later tonight to see if that's a
thing that does not interest me look at
me should be should nice lookin under to
funder not to fund that have fun all
right
retain a look at some crowdfunding
campaigns and looking at which one suck
and which ones are awesome it's the only
two way the only two ways it's all or
nothing it's all another man
so I'll list it let's look at the most
funded belt in history nice not not like
a like a belt for your car but just like
a belt for your waist all right - most
fun ok this is the smart belt funded at
1.3 million dollars for a belt what
that's a lot of belt money what why what
what could this belt possibly do to
warrant 1.3 million dollars in funding
well for starters it's got a Kevlar core
so it will never stretch or tear it will
never stretch or tear this could be the
very last belt you ever buy ladies and
gentlemen but I don't even think that's
enough for 1.3 million dollars of
funding it also has an automatic buckle
Wow ratchet has a ratchet and track
system that allows up to 32 increments
of adjustment so you know like with a
regular belt you've got the holes right
yeah you get the holes and the holes are
generally spaced what an inch maybe an
inch and a half apart that doesn't allow
for lucky if you're lucky and you got a
killer belt
you know for a lot of people that
doesn't cut it one-one hole is too tight
and then you go to the next hole and
it's too loose a your your it's a
classic Goldilocks debacle but the
automatic buckle allows 32 increments
with a 1/5 of an inch between between
between intervals so the smaller animal
is 1/5 of an inch apart so you get the
perfect fit you the absolute perfect fit
it's the best belt ever on top of that
it's made with pure Italian leather I'm
like a mom and pop shop in Italy they're
really yeah there's like two dudes
making leather two dudes making leather
brow it's like the best leather you can
get the best leather in the world so all
of this equates to 1.3 million dollars
in crowdfunding a belt like this will
cost you $60 if you decide to back it
today on IndieGoGo $60 for a belt now
it's been so long since I purchased my
belt that I use regularly everyday
almost I've imagined it was for far less
than 60 bucks I'd say is probably like a
twenty twenty-five dollar belt the most
so I mean 60 bucks for a belt that's
like two or three times the amount that
I spent on mine if it's gonna last me a
lifetime it might be worth it how much
was that belt
this is my belt it is a single strap
this is actually a vans
built I used to have a belt like that it
has an amazing walking system that
allows you to lock it at any points
along the length of the belt there's no
holes look I can adjust it to whatever
length I want I got this belt when I was
16 years old what yes what why don't you
put that on IndieGoGo I have a couple
other belts you like this is a casual
belt right what are you doing I have a
couple other belts I've had this belt
since I was 16 years old it says it
works just keep on it's just nothing
keeps
going it's not gonna wear out I'm like
holding my pants up I guess is the point
I'm trying to say but I think the
difference is probably the versatility
of having a genuine Italian leather belt
and sort of the the the the flexible the
flexibility of situations you can wear
it at right you can wear it to a wedding
you could wear it on your prom night you
could wear it at a family gathering you
wear it at a formal or informal event
365 days of the year you probably
couldn't wear your vans belt it's not
very formal probably good wear your vans
Melton's with a lot of fancy schmancy
places but props to it holding up for
this long I just I mean I think about it
every so often I'm like I'm still
wearing that belt yeah and you know it's
one of the best investments you've ever
made I have anyone asks you that okay
one of the best gifts or one of those
things I just ended up with loves like I
have this belt now we found in the trash
yeah I found in the trash and it's
lasted longer than longer than most it's
my sister's friends longer than most
toys that's it's a good build that's a
great never letting this belt go that's
a great belt story I wish I had a great
belt story when I meet good build
stories yeah I didn't know I would be
relating my belt story today anyway
you've touched a lot of people today
Paul your belt story so clearly this
this this particular campaign is not
going to appeal to Paul so let's see if
we can one-up it with something that
really interests him here we have the
world's first automatic toothbrush
alright for any campaign on Kickstarter
or IndieGoGo to be successful you need
to include world's first at the
beginning of whatever the you're
selling pop so this is the i'ma brush or
am a brush however you want to say three
point six million euros funded so it's
still a ton of money it's still
insanely funded this is an auto
toothbrush yeah automatically brushes
your teeth in guess how long Paul ten
seconds ten seconds and they're claiming
that if you use this toothbrush it will
see
up to a hundred days of time throughout
your lifespan
you could you could live a hundred days
longer you can have a hundred days of
extra time by using this device it is
incredible it uses a magnetic connection
between the mouthpiece and the handpiece
so that you can swap different
mouthpieces between family members it's
got that little wireless charger there
so you can stash your your your
mouthpieces you know this is mine this
is my wife's this is my friends whatever
I know my friends I don't my friends he
doesn't live with us and there's
toothpaste foam that's inside of the
mouth you can see that blue gel
yeah that's toothpaste in the in the
hand in the handpiece part and it
basically injects into the mouthpiece
and it creates like a foamy toothpaste
experience and then the the bristles on
the mouthpiece start to oscillate and
vibrate as it cleans your mouth and your
teeth to a tee and then you just put it
back let it you know wirelessly charge
overnight you never have to like worry
about it going out or whatever while
you're using it and yeah it's pretty
much the best invention ever made which
is why it has 3.6 million euros in
funding which is insane but no person in
chat it cannot run Crysis which is why
it does not get my vote but still it's
very compelling I think this is so
exciting for a lot of people because
we've been brushing our teeth for the
same way the same way for lots a long
time I don't know I can I say hundreds
of years for hundreds of years we've
been brushing our teeth the same way
more or less this is definitely a
revolutionary if it in fact works and
even you know eventually one day exists
pretty interesting 119 euro for the kit
comes with two mouthpieces so for you
and a friend or you and a family member
a hundred and twenty euro thereabouts or
89 euro for one piece I would do it I
would do it I hate I hate brushing my
teeth I hate it I hate it so I have a
thing whenever it whenever I brush my
teeth I go for a walk and my wife has
started doing
- like edges it's one of the I don't
know when I started doing it or what but
like I brush I'm pretty good about
brushing my teeth like I do oh yeah me
too
I do twice a day at minimum sometimes
three times a day cuz sometimes I do a
late afternoon brush just my mouth is
feeling not so fresh but like when I
brush my teeth I did I get it set up and
then I like wander around the house and
I like I like look at things I feel like
I'm doing something like I'm being
productive or something but it's really
I'm just like behind time yeah yeah but
it means that I brush my teeth for
longer so like I feel like I do like the
the this actually talks about like every
other person of person avoids tooth
brushing because they're too tired
the average tooth brushing time is 60
seconds instead of the recommended 180
but I don't know it's for me it's like
the the brushing action like I feel like
you need some of that in there and then
obviously flossing like you got floss
right I don't know I just I have to try
it I have to try it - really yeah
if you I don't I don't think it I don't
think it eliminates the need for
flossing I don't know clams do you guys
so you would still probably need to
floss which seems like a great follow up
product for whatever company this is but
I feel like it's one of those too good
to be true it's like when you when you
go to the carwash right you there's the
hand the hand car wash where the guys
out there and he's scrubbing it and
detail it that's like regularly brushing
your teeth yourself and then there's
like the drive-thru 10-second car wash
right we're just like bristles like
cranny and then at first glance you're
like yeah it's pretty clean it's like
well yeah it's much cleaner than it was
sure but does it qualify you know is it
is it clean enough to the point where
you don't encounter any sort of cavity
risk or anything like that or you know
needing a root canal whatever the hell
it is that is but you know what I mean
there's definitely a lot of skepticism I
believe around this product at least
from from our end but if it works and
like its dentist approved it works it's
amazing I will take I'll take the reeks
I agree if it works it's awesome I will
use it on my but if you can tell me that
you can take something that I spend
every day doing
five and seven minutes and cut it down
to 30 seconds I'm down for that to know
I'm skeptical this is what I'm saying
yeah one more
voltar man this is the world's most
powerful smart wallet allegedly with 1
million dollars in funding this is a
wallet that's very smart don't watch the
video unless you want a great laugh at
how cheesy and ridiculous it is it
alerts you there's a wallet that alerts
your phone when when it's lost if you
let's say you leave your phone in the
cab like they use the example here or
you leave it you know at the strip club
your phone will go off and it'll let you
know where the Jeep GPS location you can
look on the map or whatever it'll be
like your dude your wallets here you
lost your phone your lost your wallet
you lost your wallet this is also kind
of cool because we've already seen the
GPS thing in wallets that's that's old
news but this is kind of cool it'll also
snap pictures of anyone who opens your
wallet when it's in lost mode so I guess
if you've lost your wallet you can like
the wallet has a camera built-in who has
a camera built-in a tiny camera that
will snap photos of the sick perpetrator
who opened your lost wallet so you can
for one verify that it's yours by
showing it to them look I got a picture
of you on my phone cuz you're a dick can
you open my wallet and - you can also
see you know who's stealing your wallet
or using your your cards fraudulently or
whatever it is and you can use your
wallet to find your phone he just did
that yes it's reversible see exactly you
can use your wallet to find your phone
if you lose your phone this guy loses a
lot of he's mine is very apps my I
wouldn't trust it with my life this
woman seems to think he's the but
she's she's an idiot just like him um
it'll it'll also act as a global Wi-Fi
hotspot which okay I don't know how it
exactly that like an LTE connection it
doesn't even say they're very sort of
broad on that I don't I don't understand
if it has an LT if there's a
subscription to this it can't just get
the Internet I don't understand global
Wi-Fi hotspot they're new and too many
things here is a Swiss Army knife of

it also has a built in 2600 milliamp
battery which again is nothing really
new for what a smart smart wallets and
stuff it supports a cable charging and
wireless charging so you could actually
charge two phones or two devices at the
same time with this wallet assuming that
the phone supports wireless charging
this is going for a hundred and fifty
bucks for one wallet
it's a bifold I know there's a whole
like cake vs. pie argument with you know
bifold or trifold by folds way to go
I like bifold personally as well I
actually have a no fold I have a wallet
that has that has nothing I have a no
fold wallet it's just it's just the
piece of leather with some pockets in it
and it's amazing the less folding the
better it's not that's a what sorry
that's like that's like you're building
a hallway and saying here's my house
that's no you know what no
that's your okay
a bifold wallet is the equivalent of
like having to click into a folder
before you get to the file you want like
why don't you just put that file that
you frequently access on the desktop and
save yourself some stupid clicking yeah
a bifold wallet provides you with the
ideal amount of protection and privacy
without having to be concerned as Kyle
was just moments ago as he pulled his
wallet out of his pocket Wow Wow
potentially flashing personal
information to people on the streamer so
you know you do Paul you turn your ID
the other way and now you can show all
360 degrees of the wallet scot-free I
fold wallets very opinionated on wallets
I found I just said that I think people
why do we even have wallets or keys my
card I'll just live I prefer to ditch
the wallet entirely if yeah I can we
don't just live every whenever I go to
Vegas I do like a no wallet like I pull
out just the vital comes out of the
wallet and not like all I walk around
with is
just live like a wild animal yeah so
it's meant to be alright
so out of these three Paul which one
speaks the most to you uh that's that's
the belt the toothbrush or the stupid
wallet so practically speaking again
assuming it works the the toothbrush
thing like I just feel like it's the
most like you're going to use it the
most you have to save you the most time
and all that kind of if it is actually
as good as as a fault of course she's
brushing I agree but I mean that's a
game changer if it if it does what it
says it does in the way that it says it
does it's a game changer and everyone
should have one three point six million
euro for three point six million euro it
better do all that bad all right let's
move on to our next segment for tonight
which is PIP my PC thank you guys so
much for tweeting me pictures of your
rigs Paul and I are going to judge them
critique them hopefully help you build a
better system or at least make some
modifications to your own to make it
less ugly stuff like this gonna be great
it's gonna be great
tres travis has a core i7 4790k eight
gigs of ddr3 1600 and EVGA gtx 1070
super clock a 480 gig SSD one terabyte
7200 drive and a cougar Panzer case with
a Corsair H ATI GT cooling down that
4790k um I like it I mean I like it
looks very functional it doesn't look
like there's any red flags that wouldn't
you know hinder the performance of the
system although there are a couple
things aesthetically that you could
improve here I think the fans for one
selection yeah fans look a little bit on
the on the cheapy side um a little bit
on the budget side they also don't
really match very well I feel like
there's two there they're kind of
mismatched there's a blue one and then
some clear ones a couple blue ones
couple clear ones you've got a bag you
know the rear fan which is totally
different another one at the top that's
way off game so I think maybe sort of
unifying the fans unifying your fans
does a lot theater system did you also
notice he has a fan right here
on the five and a quarter inch bay it
seems like on the five and a quarter
this is a fan oh no this is the radiator
yeah this is the radiator exhaust I am
crazy
so so can feel that way that's like why
is this there okay so it's not a common
place for a 120 millimeter exhaust and
there's tubes going into the five and a
quarter inch tubes that okay no forget
what I said
yeah but but I yeah I mean there's lots
of fans they don't match there's a lot
of mismatched fans the cable management
looks like it's a look like it's it's
like how you're halfway there with the
cable management I feel like you could
just tighten up some things looks like
there's some cables coming off of your
your AI oh the waterblock that could
maybe be a little bit more tidy there's
also like the one that's above the
tubing just above the tubing yeah that
one like that is that a probably for the
pump or for the fan or something like
that it just looks like it could be
tucked away a little bit more nicely
yeah more discreetly obviously you've
got some ketchup and mustard going on
which is never good for any system
unless you're going with the ketchup and
mustard een which most people aren't so
maybe getting some sleeved extensions
some really cheap ones you know that
just blend in just some simple black
ones you can get them for pretty cheap
and you don't need to deck out your
whole system with them maybe just the 24
pin ATX and and your PCIe even though
you do have that nice little what's a
called well EVGA PCIe rerouting thing
well and on the power wall power link no
power Lee is it darling
yep apparel link EVGA power link that's
done yeah yeah okay thank you thank you
check Harley
power link even though you got a power
link you can still sort of see some of
the ketchup and mustard tardiness coming
off of it and yeah I think you think so
all those things it should be a better
system because your your your
motherboard it's pretty color neutral
you've got some red accents there but
it's not it really clashes with anything
else other than the cables and fans so
if you take care of the cables and fans
you should have a much prettier looking
system yeah that's it I agree it's all
you gotta say Thank You Travis
sings Travis next up we've got Carlos
sorry Carlos exist oh no what happened
it worked so well before alright sorry
Carlos sure catch you next time buddy
alright next up we've got codeine good
day good day i seven 4790k 4.5 gigahertz
two gtx 980 s in sli and doesn't say
what a random SSD what case what case oh
this is a this is a corsair 750 D or
something like that something around
those lights okay first thing change
that SLI bridge you just turn around
right now get a new sli bridge replace
it with a nice one because I feel like
all SLI systems should have a
pretty-looking SLI bridge I agree
yep additionally I think red modules
don't really match with the sort of gold
vrm I'm sorry yeah the gold VRM
heatsinks that you have on the
motherboard and the white frames around
your fans
I think either some white sticks or some
gold sticks if you can find that shade
of gold which is unlikely so go with the
white ones I think that would bring out
I don't know it would make it would make
the the CPU region of your system pop a
little bit the red isn't doing much for
me personally and remember there's a
very subjective segment guys cable
management looks pretty good I think you
know maybe you could zip tie the PCIe
cables a little bit make them group them
together a little bit more solidly yeah
these like the like you're using the
daisy-chain PCIe cables here for for the
8 pin connections it would be nice to
see those either tied down or possibly
if your if your power supply supports it
run individual cables up for each those
plugs that might look a little bit
better but you might not be able to you
might be stuck with those daisy chains
but just tell those tales extra loops
down a little bit yep and I'm sorry this
is near 540 isn't it I said it was a 750
D because I just I knew it was a Corsair
case an older Corsair case but it's
definitely an air 540 because we've got
no
our supply here it's on the other side
of the motherboard tray and the double
grommets in the back and DubLi grommets
all right but thank you could mean the
Kadeem good late our next we've got CBL
Oh UNT clowned glomped come come out
with a Z on Xena a water-cooled Xeon
whoo X 56 78 4.4 gigahertz what what's
going on that fan you're overclocking is
Ian that's impossible
oh it's the next 58 micro msi gtx 770 2
gig 12 gigs of ddr3 memory
triple-channel
500 gig 850 Evo 1.5 terabyte WD green
evolve what's up at the fan retro ATX
case is that from the vrm which one the
fan Li fan oh just that the what other
fan would I need to talk to you is it
just it's just sitting there it's not
mounted anything gotta beef I think it's
just our every fall in there free free
free ballin and then you get the fan
cable that's going straight over your
video card just doesn't look all that
great hey I don't understand why that is
where it is it must be a BRM fan I mean
there's nothing really else that it
would be targeting at all unless you're
experiencing some like poor vrm temps I
wouldn't put that fan there I feel like
you don't put a fan here like this
unless you have some reason to do it
and if he's overclocking a Xeon on x58
then maybe his viren's
are getting why wouldn't he like specify
why the fan was there there's no no
maybe it's just one of those mystery
things it's like piques your curiosity
and you're like why is it like that
maybe he just like plugged it in for
this picture yeah it's just a troll this
I agree with how this cable coming out
over the graphics card like that can be
solved it can run under the graphics
card it would be look way way better and
then again you got a loop an extra loop
from your PCI Express graphics cables
coming out right here
interesting build like that it's just
he can't block out of Zenith yeah that's
cool
literally yeah interesting yeah honestly
I'm not I'm not opposed to the fan I
feel like the fan doesn't look awful
it's weird the cable looks awful the
cable is the only thing that stands out
the most to me I don't know the fans the
fans still triggers my OCD because just
like the faintest tilt like the thing to
think just push would cause the fan to
go over like just the fact that I know
that it's like just free and not mounted
to anything sort of drives me up the
wall
personally plus I think that fan would
look a lot better that Corsair fan that
nice Corsair family look better mounted
to the rear like the rear if you replace
the rear fan with the Corsair one and
you use the whatever Oh am fantex fan at
the back as the vrm fan because I feel
like it would blend in a bit more okay
just personal thoughts so you can remove
these little blue caps from your SLI
bridges yep alright and the green
sticker off of your iover next up is
justin justin just a lot when judy was a
4790k build a lot of 44,000 series 16
gigs memory and a freaking optical drive
um optical drive is probably the least
of your worries here buddy it looks like
you could go for a PSU upgrade i don't
know yeah i don't know a power supply
that is but it looks old and scared is a
sketchy power supply Wow yeah I mean it
looks like you've got I mean a guarantee
you've probably got a molex to PCIe
adapter to power that graphics card it
just does not look very kosher IMO I
feel like swapping out the power supply
one with all-black cables would do
tremendous wonders to your overall
system yeah and whatever other cables
you have in here that are multicolored
like that blue cable that's maybe a SATA
cable or something like that just
blackout everything this will look like
this looks like a $300 system right now
you can take that to like a thousand
dollar system by simply replacing the
cables and power supply just
aesthetically everything else looks
solid I mean you got some sexy RAM in
there got a nice cryocooler
beautiful video card and lovely case
from fractal and yeah I mean I don't
even mind the optical drive it's really
the cables and the power supply that
need to be fixed here I agree I think
that's it power supply doesn't not stand
out that much you stopped well thank you
everyone who submitted your your your
entries for pin my PC we will be doing
this again very shortly in the near
future so if you didn't get picked this
week there's always an opportunity for
next time
and on that note we're gonna go ahead
and read off some donations thank you
guys so much for donating by the way
we're gonna try to bolt through these
pretty quickly so that you know we can
like eat dinner and stuff that's already
8 p.m. our time oh yeah let's see where
did we leave off Kyle's have to the show
oh look who's gonna need one first Cell
processor self stop donate now stop it
dammit sir you're a dick and I hate no I
can't even say it I can't even say the
words I love you so much
Thank You Kyle I love you in this many
dollars they don't get excited thinking
it is the same as awful have a office
for Heather both of you keep up the good
work you know what I would give half to
Heather had she not donated $5 to Pauls
half the ship so Heather if you're
watching guys about that I love you is
what I wanted to say Heather if you're
watching this I love you my wife
everlasting love exactly touch my heart
I'll be good all right let's move on
thank you so much sell your cell I love
you dude next one we've got coolie 7 7 7
0 7 $10 I am upgrading to a 7700 K have
a crier eh7 we'll need to upgrade to an
AI Oh cooler well will I need to upgrade
to an a Oh cooler it depends no you're
fine it depends no you're fine depends
tomorrow on what if he's trying to hit 5
gigahertz
okay the h7 is an amazing price
performance cooler I guarantee it
everyone will be satisfied with it if
you're trying to tame a beast like the
7700 K and you want all the goodies and
you want to overclock it to 5 gigahertz
and you're hitting 1.3 1.3 5 volts then
the h7 might give you it might it may
not suffice it may not keep the
temperatures you're comfortable with you
might be hitting 80 to 83 degrees
Celsius which for a lot of people is
totally fine I don't give a but if
you will if you're like me and you
generally like to see your cpu temps
below 80 C under load then an AO might
be a better way to go or you don't even
have to deal with liquid you can just
get a beefier air cooler the h7 again is
more or less a mainstream entry-level
option and there are plenty of other
high-end air coolers out there for
pretty much what we have here is the
fastest clocking main stream CPU on the
market right now
so again if you're comfortable with like
a modest overclock then don't change
h7 is fine but if you're trying to
maximize the most out of your processor
and you have a 7700 K then an arrow is
an option it's an option I'll say that I
think you're fine with the age 7 but
that's just me post them Zack gambrel
Zack for the 15 bucks been going through
some rough times recently but you and
Paul are keeping my head up oh I think
you're ever in the Kentucky area stop by
and I'll buy you dinner you're like
family now damn that means a lot man
it does I want to go to Kentucky
now making me all fili it stop it
Zack I know we bros and all but calm
down
Thank You Man appreciate a big sack
Christopher Calvary $5 hey Kyle and
Heather here's 5 bucks for all y'all as
well and apparently I'm silly for
thinking gold our GPS we're a thing but
damn it I'll figure something out
you're not silly at all dude I actually
messed around with the hue plus and I
found like a color I can send you the
hex code if I had it but that is pretty
goldish yeah in color you can get it
there with a GB yeah totally
it's sort of like a yellowish orange
just blend where it's like almost like
go for brown like try to find brown on
the color spectrum you might have to
lower the brightness a little bit too
actually
it and and when it's standing alone that
the lighting just looks like kind of poo
ish it just looks like
but if you pair it with gold colored
accents on other components in your
system it really does complement it
quite nicely so just play around with it
there's probably some forms on and stuff
but thank you very much appreciate that
timmy TechTV
Timmy Timmy it what up timmy 10 bucks
tell Paul he's lame for not reading my
super check love you both long time when
did you do your sister check we read
through all the super chats it must have
been at the very end say if you were
late no it wasn't it's not listed
anywhere here all right Timmy
you're lying about your super chat you
know it's super chat to lie about super
chat damn it but thank you for your blue
bye or something but thank you very much
Timmy I didn't see it Timmy come around
more Timmy where you been at Timmy thank
you very much though Jessica Gifford
five bucks with regards to my question
on the first half of the show I was
wondering also what air cooler would you
recommend for 24/7 use in the H four
forty or measure five see how about a
crier gauge seven how about that yes I
was gonna say NH 7 is a perfect perfect
choice how about a cooler master master
air for air for Erik Metzler Pro for be
a good option mm-hmm
be quiet be quiet so a little bit more
expensive but you can do like a dark
rock or something like that a shadow
rock Slim is a pretty well performing
cooler for yeah relatively competitive
pricing we've also got the inner max it
used to be ETS t40 they have a great
version of it now it's a little bit
smaller and I forget which one that is
but that's a good option - mm that's
quite a few get good you know air cooler
options in like the 30 to 50 dollar
range you do a perfectly adequate job
and you'll be totally happy with so
hopefully that'll kind of point you in
the right direction indeed thanks
Jessica thank you jujubee's $5.00 my
other project I have a 4770k and the GTX
970 should I wait for copy Lake GTX to K
GPU PS because I don't drink here's a
beer for Heather thank you thank you and
I'm there Heather will appreciate that
she will she'll never see scent um let's
see I think for right now
4770k and a GTX 970 is a perfectly
adequate solution as long as you're not
trying to play it for K or anything like
that so hang out see what happens give
it some time and upgrade your GPU before
you CPU ya 4770k is pretty solid okay
that reviews $5.00 sup guys thanks for
that dope stay positive sure Kyle you
are welcome sir yeah a great message for
us techies dealing with anxiety Cheers
muchachos
absolutely it's why I'm here man do with
anxiety on the Reg breath Heather Hansen
oh hey honey
five dollars I feel bad for always
donating to Paul here you can borrow
five dollars can you give it back to me
after the show what that's that's a
backhanded donation I do that except you
guys are married dear I should share
your finances and everything right yeah
which is why her donation is meaning so
her dating to you doesn't completely
meaningless so you shouldn't be upset if
she donates to me she's donating your
money after all very well that makes me
even that matter
Dennis fastest five dollars hey guys
looking to get a new case which case you
Rebecca recommend buying I'm looking at
either a Misha Phi C or waiting for the
half H 500 P mesh if IC is a great
option it doesn't take up too much space
it's a modestly sized for a mid Tower
and it supports quite a bit of water
cooling should you decide to go that
route or want to upgrade in the future
it's black it's black on black it's one
of the few fractal cases that does not
have like white accents or anything like
that so if you're into that it's
definitely a good option the half 500 P
is also chalking up to be very promising
offering from Coolermaster I believe
that comes out next month or something
like that so you might want to wait
around for reviews of that just to make
sure that you're making the right
decision for yourself there are
different cases when it comes to
ascetics like the mesh fi is still
pretty subdued even though it's got that
kind of angular front panel yep the half
H 500 dislike it's got some gray in
there and the framing and a little bit
more plastic accents and a little bit
more like kind of flair yeah and then
the RGB LED fans that they've been
they're like big old 200 millimeter fans
and everything looks really cool yes so
I would wait for ya a try I mean H 500 P
is just around the corner wait for the
reviews to come out for that maybe Paul
or I will be doing build with one or
something like that or a video on one
hopefully hopefully and yeah I decide
for yourself because they are two very
different cases I'm sure they're both
good cases but you know to each their
own you're gonna have to decide for
yourself what your needs are and which
one which of those cases will suit you
best check your tile lol five dollars
rise in 1600 GTX 1070 16 gigs LED Ram
Corsair 250 gig SSD 650 watt PSU
Coolermaster stock cooler where's this
going NZXT s340 400 bucks to spend
well now 395 what to do 400 bucks so
that's your hundred dollars more to
spend a you're buying all of this stuff
yeah is I'm clear or were 400 bucks to
spend on all this stuff and he's trying
to discuss how we can cut it down if you
don't have a big old hard drive then
consider it to two to four terabyte hard
drive to add in there so you have some
mass storage to go along with everything
else other than that it's a pretty solid
build all around a 1600 with the GTX 970
is a very very nice combination I would
consider spending your three hundred and
ninety five dollars on like a decent
2560 by 1440 monitor yeah you probably
gonna have our time getting something
with g-sync for that much but you don't
need g-sync I mean it's very nice to
have do you think but yeah I'd consider
a monitor for what you'd have otherwise
yeah I agree - Rob Crean Rob 15 Aussie
bucks preps I've been watching for a
couple of months now and I still can't
figure out why you call people buying
merch of Johnson PS Tex taxation is
theft
well we this is this all goes back to an
older segment that Paul gran wants on
his half of the show yeah where we did
sort of a Mad Libs type of thing but we
pushed it on a forum like on someone
else and for fantastic forums fantastic
forums where
I think it was texts indicate at the
time that we basically did some sort of
Mad Libs message to them and we were
just like alright give me a noun
give me a verb give me an adjective and
I think Johnson was one of like an
exclamation
yeah an exclamation was Johnson and
that's just sort of stuck ever since
then so Johnson isn't a Lawson
exclamation that's yep Johnson and it
seemed to fit Johnson is Johnson but
thank you very much for your donation
that's how it all started millennial dad
$5 white balance it's killing me please
don't block me white balance looks not
terrible on our end here but I think I
think your problem is you're dealing
you're dealing with the same situation
that we dealt with back at new egg which
is that you have industrial overhead
massive lights you know which give this
sort of very uniform but kind of like
yellow look to everything you need to
figure out a lighting solution where you
just kill all that and you have the
lights set up that are separate well I
just spent a ridiculous a ludicrous
amount of money on a new lighting kit my
lighting setup actually I just purchased
it this morning I'm having an intern
start next week Chris oh he's starting
next week he's super like film guy like
he's like Brandon from ltte status he
knows his and so like I need to
step up my game in terms of equipment so
that he has stuff to play with and
experiment with so I just made a huge
purchase on a bunch of lighting stuff
and and some camera gear that should
hopefully up the quality of videos like
this le leds leds nice yep one of them
is an RGB LED light I've been
considering LEDs yeah I definitely like
the fact they don't heat up like
Tungsten's do that it's nice but thank
you very much a millennial dad thank you
whitebalance seem to be fixed
Derk paying 1 2 3 5 dollars the
pyrocynical discord server sent help the
thought says sorry if you don't
understand you're very cynical discord
server go help them help them no I guess
is what we should okay Frank Dremel $5
the amazing see bomb during the Oreo
rant top kick uh well thanks thank I
will continue dropping C bombs yes when
when appropriate Clint
of ten dollars again balls balls best
comment of the night twice over
Lincoln Clint Clint wins the V child
with a find our room David Chao sucks
data ek water Brock won't making a room
on um Brock for the tread River and
riveted to Intel hardware now because of
the a 240g investment first world
problem hmm DV that is a very insightful
point so thievery just just to clarify
here your investments in the a 240g
setup from ek WB which costs how much
does that cost two hundred two fifty
depending what you get and whether
whether you got the the GPU it's like
250 yeah inclusion as well you're
letting that affect your effect to your
potential purchase of a 800 to 1000
dollar just for the processor part hmm
I'm just saying you know maybe find
something maybe find some other use for
the a 240g or or hand it down or maybe
resell or something like that and then
possibly you could still figure out a
water cooling solution for threader burg
yeah you don't need it you don't you
don't need the a 240g
and there's plenty of other options
there yeah that'll that'll handle thread
Ripper but good luck with whatever you
decide MB 67 for the $20 donation Kyle I

endless why at best five bucks any
opinion on the asrock Tai Chi X 370
motherboard keep kicking ass guys the
Tai Chi's have been very well received
from a lot of notable reviewers from to
my knowledge and they look great they
look quite quite nice and fantastical I
have not used one personally though so
take what I say about it with a grain of
salt default thoughts yeah I mean I've
I've dabbled with do I have to taking
extra seventy I don't I have the MSI
yeah but there's no like I haven't heard
anything negative as far as the X 370 in
particular from as rocks Tai Chi lineup
so I think it would be perfectly
adequate
read the reviews yeah read all them
reviews Fred rant 20 bucks missed the
first side read but here's some money to
come back from the dark side screw AMD
Intel and NVIDIA forever
well you that would shut out a fair
amount of the hardware manufacturers
that we use for the stuff that we do but
you know you're right when they make
poor decisions or not consumer friendly
decisions
screw them unless he meant screw AMD
period Intel and NVIDIA forever that
looks like good kamma yeah but it's the
internet is you could internet graphs
you could you could sort of twist his
words to make it seem like that's what
he's saying
alright thank you very much Fred
generous donation owed Hein the Reds or
Oda honey Oda honey a Ren's over five
bucks I love you guys we love you tea
right back atcha thank you very much
spooky Jackson five bucks I'm picking
parts for my first gaming PC and was
wondering if the rise in seven 1700 or
rise in seven 1800 X would pair better
with the gtx 1070 love your vids by the
way
go at the risin 7:17 hundred yeah you
can overclock pretty much within just a
very small margin of what the 1800 X can
achieve most of the time and your gaming
performance will not really suffer much
tal's correct thank you so you key does
or EE $20 need a great high-end display
case for my 1950 X SLI build what do I
need Kyle please respond in my native
Asia tongue to make it more easy for me
to understand oh sorry
I read that too late high-end display
case oh oh I don't know like the Corsair
570 X comes to mind because it's just
pure that's all tempered glass and if
you really want like a showcase for
what's inside yeah I think it does a
pretty good job you need to spend a lot
of time doing cable management and
making sure everything's perfect on the
inside but right I think that would be
suitable maybe some case labs if you're
looking really high-end mmm they do an
amazing job it's really expensive but
they have quite a few options for you
hmm anything else Oh fan Tech's antics
end to Elite until they I'm in the
hundred dollars SE dollars 8 or $900
chassis if you want a great high end
display case
say no more remember that 8 pack build
that we saw yeah I mean that's insane
good freakin Lord if you really went for
us like crazy high-end and you yeah
you're probably gonna be wanting to
install two different systems in that
case and everything to fully make use of
all the space and all the features that
are available but yeah if you're looking
for a great hand display case you're got
your options cut out totally right about
that one yep
thank you very much though next we've
got Drifters $5 $5 hey guys I have a red
Double R X 480 going rate seems to be
300 ish dollars on eBay I'm seeing lots
of 980ti is used for $300 worth swapping
mmm yeah baby yeah yeah I mean the 980ti
would I have for me or if you're not
already invested in a monitor or
anything like that from one side or the
other as far as the the art VFR stuff
goes then right yeah if you can swap
that over that would be a decent
boost in performance yep I'd go for it
Derk King one two three five dollars
