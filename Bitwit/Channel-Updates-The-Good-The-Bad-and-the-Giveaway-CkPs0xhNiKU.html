where it's just my face guys so you are
welcome Oh soup gasps so there are a lot
of things that have happened or are
happening with the channel right now
good and not so good so I figured making
an announcement video would be the
quickest and easiest way to keep you all
informed on what's going on starting
with the big exciting news first which
many of you have already heard but
yesterday morning I woke up and checked
my phone to find that the channel had
quietly surpassed 500,000 subscribers
yay it's still crazy to me that in late
2014 I quit my nine-to-five job to
pursue youtube full-time with 40,000 of
you alongside me and two years later
here we stand today at half a million by
the way that's an eleven hundred and
fifty percent increase if we look at the
benchmarks to help me visualize what
half a million people looks like here's
a picture of the melbourne cricket
ground stadium in melbourne australia
according to wikipedia it holds a max
capacity just over one hundred thousand
attendees meaning it would take five of
these structures to fit all of you who
are subscribed to this YouTube channel
it's an overwhelming depiction of just
how far this community has come since
its humble beginnings and I know I'll
never be able to thank you guys enough
for all your support over the years the
only way I can think to show my
sincerest gratitude is to continue
making informative and entertaining
content for the channel and I suppose
giving away a $1,500 gaming pc works too
back in October at twitchcon I said that
if none of the contributions donated
during my extra life charity stream were
retracted after 30 days I would give
away that system I built on that stream
to one lucky subscriber well it's been
over a month since that event occurred
and the contribution amount to the
Children's Hospital of Los Angeles has
not budged a single cent so keeping
faithful to my promise it's time to find
this high-end PC a new admin I should
mention that due to a treacherous elixir
by the name of fireball I did break the
USB 3 header on the MSI motherboard so
I've since then swapped it with a new
EVGA Z 170 stinger don't drink and build
kids just don't do it the rig is still
outfitted with a skylake core i5 66
k and an MSI gaming X GTX 1080 making
this my biggest giveaway ever and each
and every one of you deserve a chance of
calling your own as such this will be a
worldwide international giveaway which
you can enter using the link in the
description below once you're there make
sure you enter all your information
correctly and subscribe to this YouTube
channel that's it also bear in mind that
if you live in a country where giveaways
are prohibited by local law then you
probably can't enter sorry about that on
November 25th the infamous Black Friday
I will be announcing the winner on my
twitter page at bit would Kyle and I'll
be contacting the winner shortly after
if I don't receive a response from him
or her after three days the prize will
be forfeited and a new winner will be
drawn so that's pretty much it for that
cheers to 500k best of luck to all of
you and I will be very sad if the winner
uses this rig only for Minecraft now
switching gears to a slightly less
uplifting announcement I have some
crappy news that I'm gonna need your
guys's help with so cutting right to the
chase about a week ago amazon dropped me
from their affiliate program for
allegedly not being in compliance with
their operating agreement this was based
on my older videos where I was asking
folks to bookmark my affiliate link in
order to support the channel I've since
then ceased this months ago after other
big youtubers work and for the same
reason but apparently that wasn't enough
and my account was suspended without any
warning taking a big chunk out of my
monthly income actually for the first
time amazon brought in more revenue last
month than adsense which is absolutely
insane now i'm currently in talks with
amazon but the hopes of getting my
account back are very slim so i'm
praying for a miracle and i'll keep you
guys posted on the final outcome either
way fortunately my other revenue streams
like adsense and merchandise sales are
still bringing in enough money for all
the important stuff paying the bills
putting food on the table etc it's
pretty awesome that i can still make
youtube videos full-time and still
handle all of that adulting so while the
amazon cut hasn't affected my personal
life much every cent i earned through
their affiliate program was funneled
back into the channel this includes
things like buying parts i need for pc
of the month buying products that i
can't get review samples of from vendors
directly enhancements for my equipment
maintenance and so much more
the amazon affiliate program played a
huge role in bringing a lot of good
content to the channel now if i play my
cards right I could probably carry on
making videos without anyone noticing
that I've taken a financial hit but I
don't see the point in hiding it really
and if anything it's a huge weight off
my shoulders to lay it all out on the
table and let you guys know what's going
on so that we can all move forward at
the same pace so in order to mitigate
the effect of this blow as temporary as
it might be and to maintain the quality
of the channel I've set up a secondary
or a new patreon account I used to have
an old one I completely got rid of it
and now I've brought it back which is
linked in the description below and I
would like you guys to check that out
and consider supporting with a monthly
contribution if my videos have ever
impacted you or influenced you in any
way now when you go to the link you
won't find any insane milestone goals or
reward incentives there because the last
thing I want to do is write a bunch of
checks that I can't cash and the point
of this patreon isn't to take the
channel to new groundbreaking heights
it's just to get it back to where it was
once that happens though then of course
I'll be open to adding some more
ambitious goals but for now just
contribute the amount that reflects the
level of support you'd like to offer and
I've always felt that asking friends and
family for money should be kind of like
using the bfg and do summon it sparingly
and only in dire times when you need it
the most and in my four years of
youtubing or whatever you want to call
it this is the first time that I've
really felt the need to call upon you
guys for backup so a million thanks in
advance or technically half a million
thanks to those of you who are ready to
support especially when i've just taken
some heavy damage and finally closing
out with some good vibes over the past
weekend Paul and I hosted a local fan
meet up to hang out with some of you
guys and sell off a bunch of hardware
for facepalming lilo prices we're bad at
haggling additionally we're planning to
host some ebay auctions for all of you
non-locals so i'll link all those in the
description once they're ready might
want to give it a day or two though to
be honest I probably won't have that
much to sell since I got rid of most of
my stuff at the meetup however I've also
linked Paul's video down there in the
description so you can check out what
he's selling as well the reason we're
doing all of this stems from what we
plan to do with the earnings if all goes
smoothly a third of the money will be
used to kick off a charity stream hosted
by
I that will take place sometime in
December another third of the prize
money or the selling money i should say
will go towards an international cash
prize giveaway for one of you guys and a
third will be pocketed by me and paul
for beer consumption i would assume
we'll both be releasing more details
about the charity stream and giveaway in
the following weeks so be sure to keep
your ear to the ground and perhaps
follow us on twitter for additional
updates i think that's it is that it let
me let me check my notes I think we got
it all so that's gonna do it for now
guys thank you so much for watching
through this I do appreciate it and
again thank you for 500,000 subscribers
have a great week guys I will see you
all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
