Power
damn and the perfect pair to match oh
yeah go ahead and touch him if you like
I can barely fit my hands around the
room that's the laugh gate then he
looked me straight in my eyes as he was
feeling him up said he'd never seen
anything like it I can't believe what
I'm hearing right now you guys are
disgusting oh you guys talking about the
case fans oh sorry
continue the new h 500 p from
Coolermaster sports a pair of 200
millimeter RGB fans generous radiator
support and phenomenal cable management
packed in a unique industrial exterior
click the link of the description to
learn more what's going on guys welcome
back to the channel hope you're all
doing well today we are building a PC
yes yes I know switching things up it's
that time of year again where we just
decide to buy things for our loved ones
because of the holidays things like
Kwanzaa and Hanukkah Christmas you know
all the all the big ones and you know
this this build is actually gonna be
very special because it's for someone
special
it's for Chris the interns dad his papa
his father is in need in dire need of a
new PC when it comes to media playback
photo editing and whatever other random
tasks Chris's dad may be up to his aging
laptop is just about as useful as a
brick of toast that's I don't know where
that analogy came from so we're gonna be
building him a new system to change all
of that
this is gonna be a sort of middle of the
road AMD risin PC and it seemed gonna be
capable of pulling off some gaming if
Chris's dad wants to get into that or
maybe who knows maybe Chris will want to
get into it and this is really all just
a ploy to get Chris a new PC either way
I support it fully chris is awesome I'm
sure his dad I've met his dad his dad's
super awesome super nice guy and most
importantly he will not be using this
system to mine cryptocurrency so we know
we can trust him so let's all on that
notice ladies and gentleman let's go
ahead and run down the various parts
here starting with the freshest of all
parts that
picked out here and and by the way
disclaimer some of these parts for this
build might seem a little bit mismatched
because we did pull a couple components
from the OL bit wit studio here so that
explains that so starting off with our
chassis here we have the new fractal
design to find r6 this case has been
getting quite a bit of coverage on the
channel lately Chris has actually
already built a system inside this very
case with our blindfold build challenge
video that you should check out if you
have it yet and it's a super great case
has a beautiful tempered-glass side
panel that is two lessly removable
beautiful front io tons of ventilation
at the top lots of water cooling
radiator support and things like that a
very smart and ternal layout an
excellent cable management all around so
excited to be building with it again
today actually Chris is gonna put this
together because it's it's his dad so
you know if he messes anything up I
don't be liable for that but moving
on as I mentioned this is an AMD Rison
based system so we've got a rise in 5
1606 core 12 thread parts with a base
frequency of 3.2 gigahertz which we're
definitely planning to overclock we're
gonna be using the Wraiths spire cooler
that comes included with this CPU for
one it's gonna be more than enough to
handle any heat coming off of our 1600
and it's fairly quiet even under load so
shouldn't have any issues there we're
gonna be pairing the CPU with the prime
be 350 plus motherboard from Asus which
I think out of all the b3 or all the a
m4 motherboards I've spent most time
with this particular model and it has
yet to let me down so I consider it a
very reliable board based on personal
experience lots of rave reviews about it
as well excited to be using that again
today perronnette with 16 gig kits of
g.skill ripjaws 5 ddr4 at 3000 megahertz
got to get that speed up to park when
pairing with a rise in CPU moving on to
our graphics card we have the asus strix
our X 480 this is fortunately one of the
parts we were able to pull from our very
own inventory and it's a great card so
I'm glad we're actually giving it a
proper home today
it's gonna be great for things like
pretty much anything that Chris's dad
can possibly throw at it based on
whatever activities he's currently doing
on his existing laptop the 480 is gonna
be able to handle it no problem and then
some if you wanted to get into gaming
later down the line Chris also did
expressed some interest in possible VR
experiences later in the future so if
that's something that they want to get
into the RX 480 is a great starting off
point to really get indulged into some
immersive VR experiences this card in
particular the Strix
card is also a VR friendly in this in
the fact that it has two HDMI outs so if
they wanted to hook this system up to
their TV in the living room for example
to do some VR there they could connect
the card both to their hmd and their TV
simultaneously without having to use any
adapters and things like that
additionally we have a CX 550 M power
supply from Corsair it is partially
modular it's 80 plus certified and it
has flat black cables so it's gonna look
nice and tidy and finally moving on to
our storage we have an 850 Evo from
Samsung tried-and-true SSD it is SATA
base 2 no fancy nvme here but it does
keep costs down and it is going to be a
super reliable drive to boot off of with
that 250 gig capacity and for all of our
heavy storage needs we have a one
terabyte WD black 3.5 inch mechanical
hard drives so that is our line up of
parts folks it's going to be a fantastic
build for a good cause for a good person
and yeah I'm super excited to get the
show on the road
maybe we can get an LED strip in here as
well because it'd be a damn shame to not
illuminate all these fancy parts behind
this stunning piece of tempered glass so
on that note kicking it off to Chris
good luck on the build Chris and don't
blow anything up not my fault if you
alright dude
well I gotta hand it to you the system
came out looking great
it's it also it looks like I built it
myself yeah I mean I learned a lot from
you and I definitely think a lot of your
stale kind of influenced the way I build
computers now so figure ups but you know
and honestly I gotta hand it to wifey
sauce as well for finding and pointing
out that we have these beautifully
sleeved extensions that I did a couple
years ago they fit very well with the
whole design language and color scheme
of the system and I think the best part
about them is that your dad's gonna
think that this is way more expensive of
a system than it really is so it's gonna
bring you some brownie points for sure
so favors yes exactly yes he owes you
one now so I think on that note ladies
gentlemen were gonna go ahead and close
this video out with a surprise reaction
from Chris's dad as he presents this
brand-new gaming PC or whatever else he
wants to use it for on Christmas Day all
right without further ado mr. Chris's
dad enjoy your new PC
that turn around turn company gift
I'll try to get for you let's pass me
before what happy right here I know it
is what is it
open it thank you how do you know that
what I do it I didn't do anything
because you need one you know some basic
stuff oh cool
this was cheap it wasn't that expand
what yes of course I built it

towards you do you think thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
