2016 is brought to you by need for seat
go to need for seat USA comp for the
ultimate gaming chair experience for
your desk in office and Corsair they
make good products and you should buy
them what's up guys welcome back to CES
2016 this is coverage from awesomesauce
and network hope you guys have been
enjoying the content so far I'm here at
the coolermaster booth with Carter how's
it going Carter going well got a couple
of products here to show you what do we
got I see a lot of keyboards tell me
about the keyboards alright so first up
we actually have our Devastator 2 which
is the prequel to our the new the
Devastator which is our best combo unit
on the market currently but what we
wanted to do is infuse some of our own
technology which is our new switch which
kind of incorporates some of the
technologies the hybrid switch as well
as the mechanical switch so what we did
is it actually mimics that of the hybrid
capacitive so you do get a tactile bump
but without the click and as well you're
also gonna actually get the cherry MX
compatible key cap on the slider itself
so this is a great option for someone
trying to get into the mechanical market
they can actually buy the combo unit
purchase if potentially maybe a key cap
set something that you know would be
compatible if they wanted to make the
jump next to some of the higher-end
larger mechanical keyboards on market
yeah and just like pressing the keys
right now like I actually brought my 10
keyless Nova touch keyboard with me to
CES for editing and stuff and just
coming right up to here and like
pressing the keys just first glance like
I honestly couldn't tell the difference
if you told me that they were straight
peer nobody touch switches I would
completely believe you so that's nice
that you're actually introducing this as
an entry level kind of price point
option for for those who are trying to
get into that field of mechanical
switches so that's exactly what we were
trying to do so it's actually very very
much like a mechanical we can actually
call it mem Kanaka it's gonna hold a 50
gram actuation force it's a double layer
membrane with a with this half sphere on
top plus the actual slider which gives
you the MX compatibility what that does
is truly mimic a true mechanical feel
the double the double layer is also
going to give you the longevity of a
standard mechanical as well so you're
looking at 40 to 50 million presses on
on these keyboards as well and these are
completely compatible with like other
Cherry MX key caps if you wanted to swap
them out 100% and we're using all
standardized rows on all the key
where'd you see here awesome what else
we got here we got some funky colors
going on is this RGB this is our GB but
it's a little bit different so the you
always hear RGB you always hear Cherry
or even just RGB in general without the
Cherry these are gonna be genuine cherry
switches but what makes them a little
bit unique is we do utilize the Cherry
housing the cherry RGB housing which is
a clear transparent housing but we
actually cooler master is in our DNA has
been very well known to produce and cool
LED so what we did is actually utilize
our own technology incorporated into the
cherry RGB housing which is going to
give you very vibrant colors a clearer
brighter white and you can actually have
a much more concentrated light on each
individual key cap something that's
really cool about these two particular
keyboards as well is you can actually do
all the functionality on the keyboard
itself or we also offer the software set
if you want to kind of tweak tinker and
toy with it a little bit more awesome
and I see that you guys have also stuck
with the detachable rated USB micro
cable which is really nice to see right
angle so it doesn't accidentally get you
know messed up or whatever from handling
awesome and then we've also got so
basically is the difference here is that
this is 10 keyless and this has number
pad correct so this is a master keys Pro
S and the master keys Pro L the two
biggest are our two best-selling and
most well-known you know layout so the
tkl as well as the full-size so the
feature set is going to be entirely the
same the only difference is you have
dedicated for profile keys on the
hundred eight key looks really good and
what kind of a cherry MX colors are
gonna be available between these two
boards immediately upon launch you're
gonna have blue brown and red but it is
possible in the future that you might
have alternative switch types as well
switch colors excellent and MSRP
possibly I mean nothing's been entirely
set in stone but look anywhere from the
139 to 169 range awesome thanks a lot
Carter awesome all right guys now I'm
over here on the other side of the
course cooler master suite it's pretty
huge there's a lot of stuff here but now
I'm talking to Brandon and Brent is
gonna tell us about this case how you
doing today Brandon first about Greg
it's good Greg if you call me Greg yeah
alright thanks thanks a lot Ben so
what's up in this case this is the
the first time I've seen this case
actually and it looks pretty cool what
can you tell me about it well this is
our master box five and what's really
cool about this one is we've kind of
taken what we've learned from our master
case series and this is more of a
simplified version but it has features a
lot of the same interior functionality
that from our master case series we're
working right now closely with some of
our system integrators to see what kind
of configurations most people enjoy
using has a lot of area on the inside
fitting many different sized keyboards
or motherboards inside tomato tomahto
anyway what we're doing right now is
we're kind of going through our system
integrators to see what kind of systems
are per ordering for their customers
once we figure that out we can figure
out what most you know and users are
gonna need but the great part is there's
the modularity on the interior of this
case is in such a way that we can put
many many different things it'll fit
whatever your current needs are plus
future needs very cool awesome and is
this going to be available for purchase
at any point in the future or down the
road it will be but right now we're
focused mostly on the system integrators
okay cool so if is this something that
you guys are accepting feedback now from
like other potential customers if they
have some opinions about it is there a
place that they can contact you be like
hey I think this would be really great
to maybe implement in the future I think
we're always looking for feedback from
customers or system integrators
especially with this case we've already
received a lot of positive feedback
because they've seen that they can do a
lot of cool things with the case and the
functionality and the flexibility of it
so so far the feedback has been very
very positive and we're really glad that
we've come up with a product that a lot
of people seem to like at a price point
that a lot of people are really gonna
enjoy awesome ed can you allude a little
bit more to the price point or is that
hush-hush for now it's hush-hush for
right now but let's just say you're
gonna get a lot for your dollars well
thank you so much Brandon for sharing
this with us looks really promising
thank you
all right guys now we're here talking to
Dennis and Dennis has a pretty cool
cooler for us to take a look at it's a
funny play on words there but Dennis
what is this cooler and what does it do
this is the master air maker 8 this is
top-of-the-line air cooling cooler so
what's cool about this is the modular
design that we do have you can see these
in the full system we provide a front
top piece that's interchangeable so it
gives you told two different totally
different looks as well as it comes with
a 140 millimeter fan and it comes with
brackets that you could change off to
change it to the 120 millimeter fans and
another part cool thing about this is
our we improved on our vapor chipper
vapor chamber technology where we infuse
the heat pipes directly into the chamber
so it gives you cool better efficiency
our Cooley and overall performance very
cool and so like basically these
brackets to you know essentially maybe
like go down to a hundred and twenty
millimeter might be good for like
potential clearance issues if you have
like memory clearance in your case or
maybe you just have a really solid pair
of 120 mils sitting around you want to
use them you have that flexibility
available it really depends on what kind
of system you have and it really caters
to what you need and what you could put
in your system and let's go ahead and
take a look at at this guy over here
this is so this is an example of that
potential cover plate that you kind of
swapped out with with that one and it
gives it a completely new look it gives
you a totally new look you can see from
the two designs right here one shows the
both and what does it completely covers
up awesome well I know you guys have
liked this this new thing where you're
going modular for four in completely
custom with like your cases master
master case pros and stuff like that
it's nice to see you guys kind of taking
that philosophy and translating it to
other components as well like this
cooler is this some is this did you
already mention pricing and availability
sorry so it's it's gonna be available
generally 2016 actually this book and
MSRP is set at 120 999 I'll be expecting
one on a porch in a few weeks thanks
