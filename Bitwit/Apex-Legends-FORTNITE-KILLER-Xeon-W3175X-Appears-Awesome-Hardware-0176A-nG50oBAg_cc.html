show that Paul and I do every single
Tuesday 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right
here on twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
as well as our respective YouTube
channels almost every single - almost
almost every single Tuesday nice -
Asterix there but yeah today the the
first half of the show is gonna be
streams to my youtube channel that's a
bit wit and then in about half an hour
or so probably closer to 40 minutes
usually we're gonna switch gears to
Paul's channel and you can find the link
to that in my video description or you
can head to youtube.com slash Paul's
Hardware this is a fun kind of light
casual tech news show we like to give
the facts give you some information and
have a couple drinks while we're at it
because life is life is too short to
host a tech news show without alcohol
and and bottle openers oh yeah I do I do
bottle opener here has my logo on on it
oh good good segue into the merchandise
that we sell on our very nice lovely
stores oh yes we can check out - bit
with tech slash store or you can just go
to Pitt with tech where you can find
Morgan spork of various items all very
high-quality pull and I go through the
same rich and nice guy he handles all of
our distribution he is the shiznit which
is why you'll find equality on both of
our stores you can also go to Paul store
which is Paul's hardware net where he's
got a lot of lovely items as well you
should frequent both of the both of the
websites and perhaps buy something in
support of our channels very good things
will yell John's net see at the end of
its it's a borderline borderline there
yeah I don't know I don't know what I'm
saying here but yeah it's a it so it
supports us today you're plowing through
the beginning of the show yeah you know
I've done a million times so cheers
Cheers
thank you for for joining us mm-hmm-hmm
there was another thing there is I
forgot to bring this up to you before we
started streaming no let's do it live
that yeah fucking Oh before I say that
again sometimes sometimes we
occasionally use all right good morning
ah forgot that sometimes it really kicks
you in the balls
so yeah just just so your morning I may
or may not be able to stream next week
I'm gonna try I'm gonna try really hard
and if we do it's probably gonna be at
your house again okay because I will be
tearing apart the studio the whole
office is gonna be disassembled
completely boxed up into little boxes
and then transported to the new house
so um that would be my hell week next
week me and why if we saw something very
busy with that hopefully I could still
squeeze the show in next week so more on
that later just so you're aware
apparently you're clipping
I am always click sorry I am a mother
clipper like that thank you for your
super chat donations very appreciative
or very appreciative of those I will be
reading any messages attached to those
lovely charitable causes at the end of
the show would we do the after party so
thank you just just keep giving us money
well we'll get we'll get to you
eventually our first news article here
is a YouTube video actually from a
fellow tech tuber Dave QD he deals a lot
with the like a mobile expert I'm just a
lot of laptop and some smartphone
reviews but I saw this on reddit
it was actually kind of trending on the
hardware side reddit I thought was a
pretty good video worth worth noting
he's talking about 2019 laptops and why
you shouldn't buy them specifically the
gaming ones featuring RT X GPUs which
are for the most part like the max Q
variants of the desktop equivalents and
what he was saying you know makes makes
quite a bit of sense here he's saying
that these RT x cards are really they're
really solid for you know hypo 10 at ETA
me for higher resolutions to be pushing
the framerate to that hundred to 144
Hertz refresh rate you know you you
really can't get the full value you
don't really see the full benefit of
these cards unless you're gaming at
higher resolutions and he's making the
argument here that most gaming laptops
until even in 2019 still are limited to
1080p displays a lot of them are also
limited at 60 Hertz which is I agreed a
definite waste if you're giving like an
RT X 2070 max Q in one of these
but there are some 1080p screens that go
up to a hundred 144 Hertz so you know
couldn't couldn't dinar TX card lend
itself nicely to both specs that is true
yes of course his argument there is that
there's already really really good 10
series laptops on the market that can be
had for a lot cheaper that also saturate
the the 1080p hundred hundred hundred
444 Hertz demands and he's saying that
you know the 10 series was just like a
you know God's gift to to mobile gamers
when it came to laptops and to the point
where it still they're still good I
haven't really been showing their signs
of age on these 1080p screens so I
thought it was kind of an interesting
quick little video he's very precise
with his videos they're usually not
terribly long which means every every
second is is used carefully to get as
much information in there so feel free
to check him out Dave TD you've had the
privilege of talking to him once or
twice at events and stuff and he seems
like a really cool guy make some good
content so just thought that would
announce this little PSA that he's
brought to our attention
anything Paul lumion
no I've been trying to fix the audio oh
you're clipping and now it's too quiet
you've been needed the whole time no no
okay I don't know I don't know we don't
know guys give us a break I tried to fix
it before the show but then where
computers are hard alright it's not like
we're experts or anything all right
so let's move on to the next article
here from Tom's Hardware chugging along
this is about the asus rog dominus and
the Zeon W 31 75 X which have both been
listed online and with the official
prices and stuff too so Intel Xeon w31
35 X is their new flagship CPU with 28
cores and 56 threads it's it's it's
crazy it's a crazy madman CPU and the
availability for this chip is very
confusing at first a lot of people were
speculating that it would only be
available through an SI or a system
integrator or through om means but then
Intel confirmed a while back that no we
will be shipping a boxed retail unit you
could buy on store shelves and so
finally now we see our first glimpse of
a 31 75 X on new egg for
expensive $3,000
3 grand 3 grand which is I think a lot
of people just knowing Intel we're
speculating it to be a lot more
expensive than that I think 3 K which is
insane - because it's $3,000 on a
freaking CPU but I think people were
expecting you know I remember my guess
was like when remember recording my own
you asked us about it like how much do
you think that's gonna be at that Intel
event we were speculating I think I said
like 4k something like that I said five
you might have said even more than me no
I'm pretty sure I said 3,000 actually
nice at $29.99 2977
yeah sure and I said and I said the Box
would say power your creativity well get
we'll get that we'll get that clip from
from Gordon called all this to back all
that up video evidence of it in no time
there's no way God destroy it at the
last minute so it's also kind of
interesting because this is the first
time Intel's sort of rolling out their
tuning protection or performance tuning
protection plan which is basically an
additional warranty on top of the
standard warranty that protects
overclockers so if you wanted to tune
and tweak your chip and not potentially
fry your $3,000 CPU without being able
to replace it how much more but they
don't say for this for this for the Xeon
but it ranges based on the chip so I
think 30 bucks for a 77 77 70 K and 150
for like a i9 79 80 XC 70 70 70 K that's
what the article said I guess people are
still buying those 77 or 77
39 70 x o XE oh I'm trying to find the
new egg listing where is it no 77 77 97
that's what I was saying 7700 k39 80 and
then 79 80 XE XE what did I say I think
you had extra 7s in there I was I think
no I think for this order for the cable
I said 77 70 K which was too high okay
okay
you're thinking to the 30 3770k 37 - 37
70 K 15 Ivy Bridge Ivy bridge-e I was
thinking of 3770k
yeah if that chip married the 7700 K it
would be a 77 7 B okay okay okay that
should be a new segment right make up
cpu a so the other thing that was listed
on a website they're actually multiple
websites was the asus rog dominus
extreme which is one of two only one of
two motherboards that concurrently that
currently support this xeon powerhouse
the other motherboard is the gigabyte a
x1 and I feel like the Dominus extreme
has been getting a bit more attention on
the a x1 lately so the x1 like we saw
first right I haven't seen any updates
to it like it seemed like an engineering
sample when we first saw it and that's
still the only version that I feel
whereas whereas the Dominus looks like a
full-on like Asus yeah you know crazy
finished product motherboard with the
you know with little low going and the
fat cooler for the the VR M's and all
that good stuff yeah and yeah the costs
how much seventeen hundred and nineteen
ninety nine almost 2 grand for a mother
which which other computer parts can we
just like skyrocket up into the mid 1001
to two thousand dollar range
we got CPUs that's easy cables other
boards now graphics cards of course you
got your twenty atti no problem there
what we do have a thousand at like a
thousand dollar case is the em through
elite from fantex which is the only
officially sanguine case for this mug
that's a thousand dollars Kyle I'm
looking for like mid I'm closer to the
mid range 1500 and finish in when in win
needs to come out with something that's
like you know solid gold twisted helix
for the Dominus they already have it
they already have a case that's made for
the Dominus extreme but anyway point is
everyone save at least $20,000 for your
next PC build that's all it's kind of
your entry-level let's see it's gonna be
entry level map yeah twenty eight cores
they're they really need to go three and
four Way SLI again for for graphics
cards because imagine
for way 2080 TI's I really break that
20-grand barrier that's easier that's
what we're trying to do is spend more
money like sixth grade graphics cards I
think I can't do it till hack the Nvidia
drivers and make them all for work
together but the other thing about these
boards like the Dominus is it's kind of
like two motherboards than one it's got
dual 24 pin 80 exports it has dual 8 pin
I'm sorry a quad a quartet of a pin ups
quartet quartet and and and the last
sort of goes on so you actually kind of
need two power supplies to drive this
thing for that much money it should come
with like a black wire like a church
choir and every time you like you open
you turned it on in days like like that
you have to turn it out in slow motion
every time it's a new segment idea there
too we'll just put them in a jar so no
you're clipping during that oh sorry
sorry ears I know I have to get less
excited it's hard because I mean I'm
gonna be there for you chat I want to be
entertaining or I want it I need to work
on my sound design enthusiasm yeah we're
hiring a professor paired today I mean
the audio engineer I was unprepared two
weeks ago what happened in the time in
between things I was very busy with you
had things lots of things life having a
baby Hawaii
I don't but let's move on to the next
Hot Topic item which is an ROG branded
our GB backpack now this is probably old
news to some of you because it's from a
CES video from real hardware reviews but
I somehow missed this this is my first
time catching wind of this and it must
be other people's first time seeing it
too because otherwise I wouldn't have
this wouldn't have been on a news
website today look at that but I also
just love hearing JJ talk about a
backpack our G backpack it's like it
just feels like with the amount of
knowledge in JJ's mind this is like a
backpack is beneath him but but here he
is he can work at Banana Republic if he
wanted to
he's very good at explaining things as
usual
this video is no exception and here we
have our GB and I guess there's a bit of
functionality involved because it
illuminates the interior so if you're
fishing around for something at the
bottom and you're in a dark space and
dark environment then there might be a
little bit of help there he goes on to
say other things that don't interest me
nearly as much as the fact that this
that's that someone made in RGB backpack
kind of screams steal me that that's
exactly what I thought I was like could
you draw any any more attention to
yourself and like look even my backpack
lights up like imagine what's inside of
it probably things worth stealing
definitely you're not gonna carry like
lint and you know a piece of gum in a
backpack like that I probably cost more
than what most people have inside their
packs so it definitely needs to be a
stealth mode I agree fortunately avoid a
backpack there's really no that's and
that's the maximum amount of time we can
talk about in RGB backpacks yeah we
should come on gigabyte this could be in
one of Paul's oh joy segments gigabytes
is planning to lay off up to 10% of
their motherboard staff this is from
overclocked 3d nets that's pleasant
motherboard sales are have been really
low due to decreased crypto mining
demand and just weak motherboard sales
overall they sold gigabytes sold 16
million units in 2016 16 million and
then a year later they went down to
twelve point six and then in 2017 I'm
sorry 2018 down to eleven point four
five so they're hoping to get over ten
million this year but I mean down from
sixteen million
just a couple years ago is uh it's
definitely it's got to be some
hard-hitting data there MSI and a Chiefs
have been feeling the pressure too but
they're not laying off anyone at least
they're not being a public with it
gigabytes the only one here and they
might see a bump in sales to some degree
with the release of third gen rising
once that comes out the second half of
this year
but I mean rising you know clearly
rising second gen and even first gen
hasn't really been doing them any favors
so far so when it says workforce I have
to wonder who that who that applies to
like is that across all departments at
gigabyte right yeah they just market
actory be talking yeah you know I would
think it's from every every department
but Tibet and it's unfortunate we've
we've had some good friends who we've
met and worked at gigabyte over the
years yeah coming on yeah
hopefully no one we know is affected
only the people we don't know because
they were less important I'm just
kidding
I was a joke great stop peeking it's so
hard I'm not used to this this kind of I
know annotation I really I really did
spend a few minutes on the mics before
we started the show today yeah I'm not
there's a bunch of other stuff I had to
do okay I didn't I didn't test
excitement though all i was like i was
like hey check check one two testing and
it sounds like that sounds like yeah i
didn't check like they like that right
do the kyle test I didn't have the Cal
test there's no way that I can lower it
on this thing is there I have a
compressor there is a compressor like
what am i max the compressors max like
this thing isn't like maxed out or
something no these are very possible to
compress I was good mic because my
transmitters have like a setting where
it's like there's a plus whatever
setting and stuff is that what you're
talking about yeah just you know if
there's not we're at zero right now
we're at zero
Oh
it is not at the plus it's just like
that way and this is the standard
standard D Oh minus plus 20 here's is it
plus 20 yeah don't do that why are you
doing this
wait is mine like that why would it have
it on the transmitter and the receiver
mine's also a plus 20 all right let's
sort of okay this is too quiet
I can I can put it to ten which would be
you don't touch that I've got room over
here okay I've got room to where oh my
god the quiet is that it's that better
yes oh I'm not the gain is that a reason
is it a respectable level so quiet I can
barely hear you I what our levels here
we're back where we should be all right
what about now pretty good pretty good
getting better better getting better
better better better good turn this up
everyone's so good yes I think all right
good job we figured it out get in there
still too low no quiet you're the
minority shut up just kind of keep from
the peeking damn it
alright well let's let's continue since
it sounds at least it's a little bit
better than it was before
okay another article from overclocked 3d
net about the whole metro dove debacle a
little quiet is better than peaking I
agree what we're at here yeah so you
might have heard about this Paul the
metro fans like you know the Metro
franchise oh yeah I met you last night
so if we benchmark I pre heard that on
Steam I'm really looking forward to
downloading it and playing it on Steam
pal well that's that's funny that you
shouldn't have it's funny you should say
that Paul because that's the the whole
issue is that for the first time in as
far as I can remember the next
installment of the Metro franchise will
not be launching on Steam oh but rather
is being reserved as an epic game store
exclusive epic game people gamers are
losing their mind
epic game store
how's Dare that's lame what
but steam masterrace all praise be to
gave it so gamers have been threatening
to boycott the game saying we're not
gonna buy we're gonna give in to your
platform exclusivity we don't like if a
game store we want it we want to be on
Steam like it always has been we don't
like change
it's 20:19 terrible change some change
so to make matters worse and just sort
of stir things up there was a one of the
developers from for a games that's the
developer of the the series he posted on
the forums in a Russian it was
completely in Russian and people
translated there's a live shot of Russia
right now yeah that's this is a live
feed right here snow falls very slowly
there yeah this is you can see the devs
house in the background hi-hi Hiro so
people used a translator and translated
what this Russian dev had to say and
they basically broke it down to him
saying hey look if you don't buy the
game if you boycott our game then we'll
never make another PC version of this
metro series ever again and you'll just
never get to play on PC ever that's how
the Internet interpreted it Wow when in
reality that's not what he said at all
he was really saying look if you if you
boycott this game and no one buys it the
nature of business is that our publisher
will say let's not make this game or
anything like it on this platform again
because because sales because we hate
gamers because cameras all suck and is
that we just we spite you know it's it's
just a nature of business but he was
saying it as a very in a very
matter-of-fact way that wasn't
threatening at all but the internet was
very quick to just pop it into like
Google Translate and then without any
real context or you know Oh Google
Translate ability it's very good we're
not quite there yet at transmitting
subtext not we don't quite have the
Babel Fish figure announces between
languages figures of speech yeah homina
homina menudo okay that's that's hominid
I don't know where we went wrong there
so editing rate you should also not
freak out if like one person from the
company says something they're just a
person it's not indicative of the whole
company's opinion and for a games even
came out with a statement saying look
it's just the dev side what he said it's
you know we have our own opinion so try
to keep him separated guys don't freak
out and they also said before I also
said look this was never really our
decision to veer away from Steam this
was all that kind of threw their
publisher to the bus which is cos media
and Deep Silver hook Coke medium coke is
it coke
yes coke media I like I like that even
better they they basically said we have
no choice of what platform our game
lives on it's not up to us
so you're gonna get mad at someone get
mad at our publishers we're just we're
just making the games bro so yeah we'll
see we'll see how how things play out
there if if there really is gonna be a
boycott how damning that might be or
maybe not they make it all I don't know
it's kind of like battlefield one all
over again or five alpha five all over
again but for different reasons
obviously yeah I was gonna say that cock
media all right let's move on to the
next article from hot hardware okay
Microsoft and their project X cloud is a
streaming service that is going to
support all digital Xbox one games very
interesting so this is sort of like a
it's a gaming streaming service it's
like the Netflix of gaming very similar
to what we've seen from Nvidia's GeForce
now or other similar services so
Microsoft is coming at it pretty hard
and they're they're starting to build
the hardware that's sort of required for
this this ecosystem they're gonna deploy
the hardware in data centers currently
that hardware consists of a bunch of
server blades outfitted with multiple
Xbox one components and the whole idea
here that Microsoft is running with is
that you'll be able to play any game any
triple-a game that's available for
digital download on on Xbox one which is
a huge library you'll be able to play
any of those games
anytime on any device whether it be a
smartphone or a tablet so you know and
with like you know a controller set
include old Xbox games I think it's only
Xbox one games at the moment I don't
think it's backwards compatibility all
the way back to the original Xbox what
you would think backwards compatibility
would be easier to implement with a
streaming service than you know hardware
based but yeah but something you could
have something like this where you've
got an Xbox physical controller with
like a smartphone on top that you're
kind of playing it like a switch in a
sense like a Nintendo switch or you can
just play your games on the go but these
are full-fledged Triple A titles that
you can also play at home on a
big-screen TV and you know seamlessly
integrated completely offloaded although
all the rendering is offloaded to a data
center somewhere that Microsoft handles
so projects s cloud is also an open
platform platform or I should say open
source platform so it's gonna be easy
for for devs - just like create games
and not have to worry about porting them
over to this service they don't have to
change in a single line of code it's all
good to go if you made it for Xbox one
and it's available for digital download
it'll automatically be good to stream
the biggest issue the biggest hurdle I
think with these streaming services for
games anyway is latency you know and
because you're just you're real time
rendering processing so much data at
once that you know you either suffer
quality or you suffer lag or latency and
you don't want either of those so that's
why we've been hearing about these
services for years and yet nothing's
really officially hard launched they're
still working out those bugs Microsoft
says they're on it though and we'll see
they're saying also that it's not aiming
to replace consoles but that they're
hoping to deliver a console like
experience which I like mediocre yeah I
was gonna say so I don't know if that's
they're really selling it for me we're
squarely aiming for the middle of the
gaming experience yeah
don't nothing nothing too exciting here
don't get your hopes up but it will
stream over the Internet and that's
that's what Millennials like Microsoft
Project X cloud think yeah all right
and our last article here is from also
from hot hardware about apex legends a
brand new game a brand new a firing game
Peaks Legion eight Peaks league ins
league ins all right so where it hit it
hit million players in just eight hours
yeah if it's launched yet did which is
nuts it also goes to show how insanely
popular battle royale games all right
now but this game does look pretty cool
I watched a bit of gameplay put it pump
it up right here hopefully don't get
violence guys blood and violent loading
whoa so it's also from the developers
who made titanfall titanfall franchise
it is set in the titanfall universe yes
it is so there's a bit of a crossover
there but there are no Titans no Titans
unfortunately but you have you have you
have two teammates yep squads of 360
people per server reset characters yes
so it's kind of like overwatch with
Battle Royale I know a lot about this
game considering that I have not yet
actually played it maybe we should play
it at some point tonight Paul
considering the ear on a computer that
hasn't loaded up Kyle oh that could be a
very distinct possibility maybe we
should just play video games on behalf
of the show I would not fight you on
that partially well partially do that
would not fight you so I I can't I just
like saw people kind of buzzing about
this last night in this morning so
mm-hmm
you know yes we'll see we'll see if this
is just an initial launch like kind of
excitement or if it's the type of game
that has the the tendency to there the
capability to stand the test of time
right I mean look you got a zip line so
I mean does look a lot better than
fortnight I will say there's definitely
more my speed
kind of reminds me of
evolve a little bit with the different
classes and the fact that it's
first-person but evolved was really fun
at first and then it kind of fell flat
there wasn't it wasn't much longevity to
that game so it's it's very common when
a game will blow up initially in
everyone's like oh my god but then it
just loses steam really quick so we'll
see we'll see if this one is here to
stay like fall say it's battle royale
the there's 20 teams of three that drop
into each game so you're on a team with
two other people by default so they're
going for the team experience the small
team experience versus like a solo
experience or I like a big brawl big 20
versus 20 Braille or something like that
right and then you have a passive
ability and active ability that's on
cooldown and an ultimate ability that
charges up and you can use and that's
those vary based on the eight different
characters that you can select so you
have looked into this quite a bit I read
and it's one of the Articles that I
talked about I this I selected to talk
about on my half of the show so I've
spoiled everything already though but we
also are gonna actually play this a
little bit on my half of the show
because it's loaded up on cows computer
there and that's it up to captured and
all that stuff sounds good cool that is
gonna do it for my half awesome heyo
so don't go anywhere guys we're gonna do
quit cut really quick on YouTube and
then we'll be right back on Paul's
channel again you can find the link to
that in my video description or go to
Paul's Hardware on the youtubes and if
you're on Twitch just stay where you are
we'll be right back thanks guys feel
free to do timestamps goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
