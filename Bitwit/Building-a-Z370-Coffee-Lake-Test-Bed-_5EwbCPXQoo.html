be quiet is finally here with a modular
design for ultimate flexibility silent
wings 3 140 millimeter pwm fans
outstanding water cooling support and so
much more the white edition is available
in limited quantities so catch it before
it's gone you can learn more by clicking
the link in the description below what's
going on guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well today
I am assembling my very first Z 370
slash coffee Lake eighth-generation
test bed and whether or not you agree
with intel on how they've handled this
launch surrounding all that controversy
this platform still needs testing today
will be building with intel's flagship
cpu the core i7 8700 k which features
six cores and 12 threads yes it is hyper
threaded and yeah it's it's not a quad
core guys previously if you wanted
anything more than 4 cores on a cpu from
Intel you had to opt for their high-end
desktop platform but that is no longer
the case as of now with with all the
competition that Intel's trying to throw
AMD's way I'm trying to compete with
Rison and stuff so now we've got a six
core twelfth read part for about three
hundred and sixty dollars MSRP I believe
now part of the controversy if you guys
aren't aware is that Intel is sort of
forcing users to upgrade or use a Z 370
a new Z 370 motherboard with these 8th
gen CPUs when they're still using the
same LGA 1151 socket and from what we
can tell has the exact same contact
layout on the bottom of the CPU so it
sort of begs the question is Intel just
going for a cash grab forcing users to
buy into a new product when they don't
really technically have a need to Intel
is claiming that these e3 70 chipset
brings about some changes to the power
delivery that that takes into account
the additional cores and threads on
these copy Lake CPUs and so whether or
not you agree with that you guys let me
know in the comments below
always curious to hear your thoughts on
this sort of thing putting this aside
for now though let's talk about the rest
of our all-star lineup of hardware here
we've got a Z 370 horas gaming 7
motherboards this is a fantastic looking
board I really love what gigabyte did
here there's no shortage of RGB LEDs if
you're into that sort of thing they can
be disabled of course
as well there's RGB headers you'll also
find Intel and killer Gigabit Ethernet
LAN ports on this thing and it I believe
it has three yes three m2 slots for nvme
SSDs really pairing that with a 16
gigabyte kit 2 by 8 gig sticks of a
g.skill ripjaws 5 this is at 3200 speed
and it should work just fine in our
system and we can't forget our power
supply I got to give a shout out to be
quiet for providing the PSU and the a
i/o this is the dark power pro 11 850
watt unit should be plenty of power for
if they wanted to do some SLI or
crossfire it's super high quality very
well built incredibly quiet too it's
using one of their own silent wings fans
inside of the unit itself it's partially
modular I think the only cable stemming
from it is the 24 pin HDX which
obviously you're gonna need and yet all
that all the cables are sleeved in black
sleeving
they look incredibly nice almost no need
for for cable extensions or anything
like that if you're going for aesthetics
80-plus platinum certification and then
we've got our silent loop 280 millimeter
liquid AIO which I've actually worked
with in the past it was thrown into the
$2000 be quite giveaway that I did a
couple months back I'm very happy with
the results I think you can only get
this unit in the UK right now correct me
if I'm wrong but be quiet sent it over
of course and it's also using their pure
wings two fans which are incredibly
quiet and performed really well so be
excited to use that as well today before
I forget this little guy we've got a
sand disc SSD plus that is of course a
SATA SSD with a 960 gigabyte capacity
yes it's a fairly large Drive we only
need one of them to store our operating
system of course and all of our games
and applications only one drives really
needed for a test bed like this unless
we're testing multiple drives then I'll
add those in as needed but that should
be plenty for our needs for now and
finally I have my beloved test bed that
I've been using for many years now this
is the Lian Li PC T 60 it does a great
job of just making the parts really easy
to swap in and out there are newer
fancier test beds out there that have
come out since I got this guy you know
that support radiator is liquid cooling
that sort of thing but this is really
all I need especially for this
particular test bed and I appreciate how
its kind of got a smaller footprint
compared to
newer ones that are out now but yeah
that's pretty much our cast of hardware
for today the build is gonna be pretty
straightforward there's not going to be
much cable management involved because
it is an open air test bench I think I'm
ready to start assembling about gee
wifey sauce apparently wifey sauce has
turned into a camera I'm terrified
alright guys build complete looking
pretty good the motherboard looks great
powered on I might add and as you can
see here again the radiator is just sort
of floating here there's no radiator
mount on the test bench itself but I
rather like that because I'll be
swapping out the cooler from time to
time to do different testing with
different coolers obviously so if
anything this kind of saves me some time
also I typically don't put too much
thought into cable management for a test
bench like this however I tried to cinch
down all the excess cabling this time
around just to keep the cabling
contained otherwise it sort of makes the
footprint of the overall test bench a
lot bigger and more cumbersome so it
looks pretty nice and tidy for what it
is and for those of you who are angry or
mad or salty that I didn't add a
graphics card to this setup well that's
because the GPU is pretty much the one
component that I'll be swapping in and
out the most from time to time so it
doesn't really make much sense to have a
permanent GPU in a test bench like this
overall pretty happy with how it turned
out I still have to do a risin test bed
and one for a thread ripper and one for
skylake X as well I'm probably not gonna
do a video on each of those maybe I'll
do one video for all three or maybe I'll
just tweet some pictures once they're
all done
but yeah I'm very excited to start
testing coffee like the eighth
generation of core CPUs from Intel is
upon us and really looking forward to
seeing how it does in this little test
bed here so thank you guys so much for
watching I'm gonna close it out I know
this was a quick and very simple video
I'm sorry guys it wasn't as informative
as some of the other stuff I do here but
thank you very much nonetheless for
tuning in have a good one guys I will
see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
