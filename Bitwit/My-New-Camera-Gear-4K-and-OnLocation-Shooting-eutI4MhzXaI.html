sharing with you some of my new camera
gear that I recently picked up the
channel no I didn't get a red camera no
it's not an fs7 yes I have standards now
while I'm sure my new Arsenal won't Wow
all of you the upgrade brings about some
quality improvements that I felt were
necessary in order to keep the channel
relevant while hopefully bringing a more
enjoyable viewing experience to you guys
as well so jumping right in let's kick
it off with my brand new camera the
wildly acclaimed and attractively priced
Panasonic Lumix gh4 not only is this
camera just a few hundred bucks more
than my Canon 70d it packs a wider range
of features and technologies like 4k
video recording and capturing 1080 at 60
fps these were really the two biggest
selling points that I despised my 70d
for not having and ultimately what
convinced me to make the switch apart
from that the gh4 also has a fantastic
sensor good low-light performance and
too familiar flip around screen that
says I'm lonely so I film myself one
characteristic I didn't expect to love
so much when purchasing the camera is
the body size it's small and compact but
still feels great in the hand which
makes it even easier to take with me to
events like CES granted what's a good
camera body without a solid lens up
until this point I was using my 24 and
35 millimeter Rokinon cinah lenses
almost exclusively and while I don't
plan on retiring them anytime soon
because they're kind of amazing the fact
that they're both prime lenses left me
wanting a well rounded lens with a tad
more flexibility so I picked up the 18
to 35 millimeter from Sigma this fine
piece of glass has been dubbed the you
tube lens by content creators everywhere
for its versatility when it comes to
shooting a range of different subjects
in a limited space not to mention having
a shorter lens than everyone else really
affects your self-esteem for starters
the aperture goes down to a generous 1.8
which gives a nice shallow depth of
field and bokeh the focal range is
perfect for the environment I use it in
and the focus ring is so smooth it feels
like butta since the lens does use an
EFS mount however it would be pretty
useless with my new Micro Four Thirds
camera so among my upgrades is the meta
bones speed booster not only does it
serve as an active
after between the two mounting standards
this brilliant piece of hardware
increases your maximum aperture by one
full stop making your camera awesome and
low-light the speed booster also makes
your lens appear 0.71 times wider which
makes shots look so cinematic you'll
think Michael Bay directed my tech
reviews and hired better writers when
used with the gh4 in Sigma lens this
small but powerful adapter helps produce
some incredibly crisp and breathtaking
shots that are leaps and bounds better
than what my old set up could achieve
now although I now have a camera that
shoots 4k it doesn't mean I'll be
recording at that resolution 24/7
because let's face it not everything
needs to be shot at Ultra HD hey does
this look infected shooting everything
at 4k also means a lot more storage
needed and rendering time required so
chances are I'll be recording 1080 video
at 60fps 90% of the time because I
personally value the higher frame rate
over resolution that being said there
will be special videos where I'll need
or want to shoot in 4k so in preparation
for those shoots I snagged two of these
256 gig SD cards from PNY the cards are
rated at class 10 up to 95 megabytes per
second and should be more than enough
storage for when I'm shooting at 4k now
while having a kickass body and lens
combo is nice all the CES planning I've
done lately made me really determined to
create a flexible setup that's ready to
handle on location events so here we
have the 515 cage from D focused systems
apart from making the camera look like a
block of Swiss cheese which granted was
really important to me a DSLR cage such
as this one lets you expand your
camera's functionality by mounting a
number of different accessories to the
cage like microphones recorders or
lighting the 515 is specifically
designed to house the gh4 in a compact
fit with 58 threaded holes for flexible
mounting and the open frame leaves
access to all the buttons dials and slot
covers on the camera for streamlined
operation although I purchased this new
arrival with off-site shooting in mind I
didn't realize how much I'd love using
the cage at home as well the cage
changed my life and it can change yours
too thanks Kate being able to mount and
swap out accessories on the fly is
absolutely awesome and it's helped speed
up my film process on a daily basis one
such accessory that I'll be mounting to
the 5:15 on occasion is my new
Sennheiser MKH 416
gun mic all too often I see the audio
get put on the back burner in online
videos but I think it's about time I
dr-40 received some help with recording
all the dialogue you hear on
awesomesauce network the mkh 416 was the
most praised shotgun mic i could find on
the interwebs from amateurs and
professionals alike so I had to give it
a shot gun as good as my dr 40 was for
the price the 416 is on a whole other
level and the directional pickup pattern
makes it just as useful at noisy events
as it is in my office from the mics XLR
output I have a line going into my dr 44
phantom power and then directly into the
gh4 for recording it's a beautiful
combination that's also streamlined my
workflow immensely now for shooting
exclusively at events or on the go I
grabbed this aluminium monopod for
Manfrotto that I'll be using around CES
and I put the model number in the
description after having to surgically
remove my old crappy monopod from my
shoulder rig with a pair of pliers last
month I vowed to never buy a cheap
monopod ever again funny enough this
model was only fifty bucks but
nonetheless the build quality is
excellent all around from the wide
mounting base to the sturdy leg warmers
to the black shaft that feels great in
my hands and finally winding down my
list of new gear is this heavy duty
rubber carrying handle from small rig
that attaches to the top of the camera
cage
this makes carrying the entire rig from
A to B so much easier than grabbing it
by the monopod or tripod it's mounted
too though I do like that black shaft
overall it's a small and affordable
addition to my setup that makes a world
of difference in a variety of shooting
environments that promotes equipment
security and mobility and that is all
the new hardware I'll be using to make
videos from here on out guys now that I
have most of the things I need I'm
really looking forward to familiarizing
myself with the new gear and start
making some killer looking videos for
y'all but let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
