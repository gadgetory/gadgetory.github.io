back to the channel hope you're all
doing well today you are in for a trick
because I am giving away this beautiful
bastard actually it's not a bastard
because I didn't really conceive it with
anyone I wasn't supposed to other than
myself but this is the gaming PC this is
a rising system that is very high-end
it's about two thousand dollars in value
I'm giving it away for no special reason
in particular
which I'm sure you guys aren't going to
fault me for this is the system that be
quiet had sponsored about a week or two
ago on the channel you can go ahead and
watch that video if you haven't checked
it out where I assemble the thing and so
yeah there's a lot of be quite Hardware
here which is not a bad thing at all
they have very high quality components
term and engineering and all that but
there's also just a ton of other stuff
packed in here that I think you guys are
really going to enjoy or at least one of
you is going to really enjoy so stay
tuned by the end of the video we'll have
covered all the details for exactly how
to enter and the duration all that sort
of thing but for now let's quickly go
over the specs again we've got some be
quiet stuff here rockin the pure bass
680 X chassis this is the one with the
orange accents and the tempered glass
side panel this is a premium case or not
terribly much money it's actually a
really good value but it looks
absolutely stunning especially with the
other components that we've put in here
including a risin 7 1800 X that is the 8
core 16th red behemoth from good ol AMD
I've overclocked it before or 4.1
gigahertz I believe but of course you
could always tune it yourself or take
the overclock off once you receive it
should you choose and then we've also
got a dark rock 3 from be quiet that's
cooling the chip currently however I
have a thing with shipping computers
when they have large CPU towers on them
because it's a bad idea
it's risky usually things break so I
actually hit up be quiet and was like
hey what have you guys sent me a liquid
cooler of year that's not even available
in the United States so that I could
slap it on to this system before
shipping it over to the winter and they
said sure but the only thing is I need
an AM for bracket this doesn't support
rising out of the box I don't want to
promise anything until I have that
bracket secured in my hand but for the
most part it seems
likely that I will be swapping out the
dark rock 3 for this silent loop 280
millimeter liquid-cooled AIO for the
giveaway prize so that should be
exciting you should even get some better
thermals on the 1,800 X so that's fun
and next up we've got the motherboard
here which is a gigabyte or SGA a X 370
gaming k7 it's a beautiful mother board
it's got RGB lighting it is one of the
more high-end a m4 motherboards that you
can get Verizon currently so you should
have no shortage of connectivity options
and overclocking support additionally
we've also got 16 gigs of g.skill flair
X ddr4 at 3200 it is running at that
rated speed and this is also a kit
that's been validated for Rison actually
those are those enriched out sighs
aren't they that's a Ripjaws 5 kit I
have to swap that out for some flares so
what you see here even though you
probably can't see it at all is not
accurate I will be swapping it out for
the appropriate flare X kit which is
rated and validated for rising so that
should be all dandy fine and dandy we've
also got a 250 gig Samsung Evo in here
some SSD of course 850 Evo I should say
with a one terabyte WD black hard drive
the system gets powered by a be quiet
pure power 10 600 watt power supply
which is semi modular I took the sticker
up because it looks a bit nicer through
the tempered glass and then finally I
saved the best for last which is the
graphics card the Asus Strix OC GT X
1080 TI which is a total monster it's
just absolutely insane you can go ahead
and check out my full review it cool is
extremely well it's super silent and
it's fast as how the thing is an
absolute beast RGB LEDs and all that
stuff
come standard now in the build video
that I did for this guy I did promise a
part to where I'd be going over
beginning benchmarks and things like
that
I'm just going to lump in those results
into this video so hopefully you guys
don't mind if I just rattle off some
average frame rates here so first off at
1440p this is what's maxed out settings
across the board guys in battlefield one
1440p an average FPS of 139 GTA 5 with
80 fps hitman 95 Metro last light 118
and 154 frames per second on average in
do
at 4k because this thing can certainly
handle that we saw 77 frames per second
on average in battlefield 181 fps and
GTA v 79 fps in hitman 69 FPS in Metro
last light and 90 frames per second in
doom so this thing is very equipped to
handle pretty much any resolution that
you throw at it as long as it's not 5 K
or 8 K or whatever K that's higher than
4 so again this thing is an absolute
monster but you wouldn't really know it
from listening because it's fairly quiet
and it also maintains some pretty decent
thermals who weren't seeing higher than
71 degrees Celsius on the GTX 1080 under
load that was during the entire testing
suite and then also the 1800 X stayed
around that same temperature and give or
take 2 or 3 degrees so overall a very
beautiful package here from our friends
at be quite Asus gigabytes etc and now
that you guys know how awesome it is
let's talk about how exactly you can go
about winning this thing so first up I
got my other notes here just to make
sure that I don't forget anything and
screw anything up alright international
giveaway global worldwide however you
want to say it I mean pretty much
everyone in their mom is eligible for
this unless you live in a country that
specifically prohibits giveaways by
local law and if you're not sure you
might want to check up on that but for
the most part to enter click the link in
the description below it will take you
to a new page and just enter from there
there are a couple of different ways to
enter there's only one thing you have to
do that you have to do to enter which is
being subscribed to this channel it's
the only mandatory thing you need to do
to enter this giveaway all the other
stuff there is all optional it gives you
a bonus entry which will increase your
odds of winning so things like following
me on Twitter or following ACS on their
YouTube channel will give you a higher
chance of winning so additionally you
want to make sure that you enter your
email address and your name correctly on
that page it's going to ask you for that
information because that's how I'm going
to be contacting you is via email so if
that's incorrect I won't be able to
contact you and you will not receive the
prize assuming that your name is drawn
if you are selected then you have 24
hours to respond to me from from the
time that I send you the email and if
you don't respond within that window
you pretty much forfeit the prize and I
have to draw a new winner the show must
go on sort of thing this giveaway is
active now until
no no about May May 26 all right May
26th at 9 a.m. is when this giveaway
officially closes and you can no longer
enter after that point at around 9:30 to
10:00 a.m. give or take depending on
what I'm doing in that moment I will be
announcing the winner on my Twitter page
which is twitter.com slash bit wit Kyle
at that point again I will also email
the person whose name I've drawn and
wait 24 hours for them to respond but
that pretty much it y'all I don't have
much else to say good luck on winning
this thing it needs a new home I'm truly
unfit to be an admin any longer to this
beautiful beautiful beast so hopefully
you guys can give her a new home or
maybe it's a heat I don't know maybe
it's both
does it really matter and you know for
good karma toss a like on the video and
why don't you leave a comment down below
let me know how badly you want this
system in your max in your house because
yeah I don't know why that came out it's
Freudian slip yeah but you know what
there is a special reason why I'm giving
this thing away it's because of all the
love and support that you guys have
shown me over the years and I know I
said this a thousand times and I'm going
to say it a thousand more times because
it's the honest-to-god truth I would not
be where I am today if it weren't for
your guys's help and it's all those
little things guys the likes the
comments the shares the favorites the
large sums of money the goal just keep
giving me those little things that means
so much and I'm going to keep giving
back to you and that's really what
giveaways like this are all about their
doubt saying thanks they're about giving
back

subscribers and that's what this whole
thing is really all about so from the
bottom of my heart guys thank you I love
