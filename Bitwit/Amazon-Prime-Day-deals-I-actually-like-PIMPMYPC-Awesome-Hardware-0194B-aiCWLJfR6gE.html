you would do manual transition and like
second one would be like hello and we'd
have like someone behind the camera
going we just need to take like an hour
or two to kind of mess around with that
stuff because you're training up to
YouTube the way you call it the good
thing yeah other things say no more yeah
Egyptians TV real thing yeah right
preview anyway welcome to awesome
Hardware episode 194 side B if you
missed side egg check it out on Paul's
channel and youtube.com slash Paul's
hardware or you can find the link to his
channel in my description or just you
know if you can show her go I've
controlled live control room is the is
the magic will fortune word and it
phrase that we were thinking thank you
please continuing debate Eve 1200 okay
so yeah we we do things we sell things
on our stores Wow where are we
bit what is my store buy buy something
I'm starving I need a third buy for
fucking we're sorry just bought
something please even if you don't like
it just help us screw coveted shirts are
back in stock bottle openers they're
great for opening bottles that mugs and
pint glasses it's beautiful Paul also
sells things cuz he's also starving
child need this you need that you look
at that polo shirt all everything on our
stores is is competing with Amazon Prime
deals at the moment just record record
low prices way better quality mouse pads
hoodies buy a polo shirt from Paul
mother effers and this is a good time to
introduce our adult warning adult
language warning don't listen to the
stream if you have sensitive ears or of
your bitch it's time for a revolution
the things have been the same for too
long we're just gonna turn this shit
upside down let's put the spray baby
all right check it got to keep this good
I'm sure everyone's leaving now Wow all
right so we like to drink okay if you do
- Cheers
currently drinking oh yeah I'm crying
now yeah this is the stuff dreams are
made out of all right thank you very
much for joining us a bow language
warning stop watching just don't watch
the show okay don't do it just click
that X click that big X that's today and
we'll probably stop more shirts on this
treatment industry the worst
advertisement ever all right so as the
title of my half suggests we're gonna be
going over some Amazon Prime deals yeah
I spent a good 20 minutes maybe
looking up it was on prime deals so I'm
just gonna tell it to you guys straight
I'm shooting straight with you I these
may not be the best deals on the site
but these were deals that stood out to
me in that 20 minute time span hey this
is something I can talk about what's
this shit - real IV all feeling this too
much sorry fuck like kidding alright
let's let's uh let's let's talk about
the first product let's talk about the
first second item hey if you are the
Amazon Prime day deals brought to you by
a cursory glance at the front page well
hey at least you bought this before yeah
yes yes and I I actually when I saw this
deal it made me mad because I'm actually
bought three of these I bought three of
these at the same time for a hundred
bucks apiece Wow I spent $300 on these
fucking webcams before and now they're
on sale for 40 bucks $40 so I figured
hey if I can't get that terrible moment
back and redo it all maybe you guys can
do it from from the get-go
face is leaking I know oh my god
plumbing everyone buy four of these so I
think this is a good deal it's 1080p
it's it's a good it's a good webcam c920
is an old standby yeah yeah I have one
on almost every system alright the next
one is the and these are like that like
the title also suggests these are
genuinely deals that I thought okay
these these are pretty good because
there's a lot of shit there's a lot of
garbage deals on primed a in case you
weren't aware these ones are actually
pretty decent deliver 200 okay maybe you
can sign out yeah okay just some
personal info shit just got super
serious it's very minor is very minor
who really wants to find me already
knows my exact coordinates that's
terrifying
so just also a shamelessly plug links to
all of this stuff is in my video
description on YouTube they are
affiliate links so I will profit if you
happen to buy something from those links
just so you're aware feel free to use
them or not
signing out removed your name it's still
there oh yeah because it goes by your IP
I think so yeah anyway it doesn't matter
it's fine totally fine yeah okay so the
second item I needed cleaning sir oh no
the tissue I haven't I have a paper
towel paper towel would be perfect this
is the first time that paper towel roll
will not be used for something other
than thermal paste pulse tears this is
my thermal paste and tears paper towel
roll okay everything's fine great for
the thermal interface material and and
the salty tears oh you can go in
incognito mode and then maybe it won't
maybe you want to show up suggested but
if it's just a little bit of info it's
fine yeah oh so the second item whew
this is hard drive yeah it's a it's a
solid-state hyperdrive SSD
2 terabyte Seagate Fire CUDA it's a two
and a half inch drive so it can fit in a
lot more places than a
three and a half inch drive can't
especially since a lot of cases these
days are slowly reducing the number of
3.5 inch drive trays it's it's really
nice drive actually I've used this
plenty of times it's it's hybrid so it's
got it's got sort of like a small area
for for SSD like a kind of cache storage
so frequently use files and and programs
and stuff like that are saved to the
cache partially to the cache so that you
get faster load times and stuff but you
still get the benefit of having a large
capacity without having to spend an arm
and a leg especially with a prime deal
of what 60 bucks down from 100 bucks
down from 102 gigs to arm sorry - 2 X 2
terabytes top coat me on that 2
terabytes of solid-state ish storage for
60 bucks not too bad
the other item I have on here was the
Razer DeathAdder Razer DeathAdder I've
actually never used this Mouse but I've
never used it I know and that's exactly
why I put it on here because I know that
this is a huge Mouse this is like a
widely popular Mouse that kind of
revolutionized gaming mice for for a
good portion of time and now it's on
sale for 35 freaking bucks
I believe it was like $90 when it first
launched years and years ago but this is
a tried-and-true option a bunch of
different variations of it yes yeah but
this seems to be the original just
straight no frills forward and back
button doesn't have like a crazy amount
that's not an MMO Mouse or whatever it's
probably great for FPS things like that
16,000 dpi sensor what more do you want
probably a better awesome hardware
episode and then we also have a 480 gig
SanDisk SSD this is the SSD plus for
going for $59 so pretty much the same
price as was that other item the the
fire CUDA so you can either get a 2
terabyte hybrid drive or you can get
this SSD 480 gigs is a really nice
capacity for a boot drive has plenty of
room for Windows and frequently used
applications these are great drives I
have several of them that I use
regularly there you go for one
terabyte version for a hundred and eight
dollars there is a one terabyte version
for a hundred just over 100 bucks too
and that's that's also a great deal so
there's that and this this finally I
didn't want to like inundate like just
like overwhelm you guys with products so
I only have five today the Acer nitro BG
240 Y this is a roughly a 24 inch panel
full HD 1920 by 1080 it is IPS has free
sync and is 1 millisecond response time
75 Hertz refresh rate by the way so and
I think 75 Hertz refresh is pretty good
for a 1080p panel since the GPU that
you're probably pairing with a 1080p
panel isn't capable of delivering
super-high frames anyway so 75 seems to
be a nice sweet spot and this is only a
hundred bucks or just over a hundred
dollars down from roughly 170 180 so I
thought this was a pretty good deal
actually I always feel like the the kind
of the entry-level starting point for
anyone who just needs a basic monitor to
get them by is like a 1080 monitor
mm-hmm that's usually around 24 inches
yeah that you can get for around a
hundred bucks yep so this is like that
but it's IPS and free sync in 75 Hertz
that's really nice section yeah
especially I think free sync is more
effective at lower frame rates yes yeah
110 bucks it's pretty nice actually my
first my first display ever was a 1920
by 1080 panel or I should say the the
monitor that I first started PC gaming
on which sadly was only like 2011 but it
was a 24 inch 1080p and I love that
monitor I actually still have it in the
garage but obviously back then there was
no adaptive refresh rate so it didn't
have free sync or anything like that so
this will probably be a lot better
it's got nice sexy thin bezels and stuff
but that's pretty much my Amazon Prime
day deals segment again I want to keep
it really brief again because it's just
just a bunch of sales and shit but yeah
good luck if you have to buy anything
from there hopefully it works out for
you let's move on to the second segment
of my half which is pit mop PC we have
one two three four five six of you
that I've chosen to critically examine
and critique your belts tell you how
you're wrong and and how to how to make
it better starting with j w JW four to
one with an 80 600 k a gtx 1070 Strix 32
gigs of engines pro 3200 with an h 100
ib 2 and h 700 I have had my PC and the
device is not available again it just
seems to be the running theme of today's
show we save let's save this
presentation yes I'm sorry I will not I
will not fuck with it again after
speaking all the pain it's caused Oh
let's July 18 makes it an easy
transition so yeah I think we're looking
at JW's j-dub yeah um and he's got a
pretty nice system here actually it's
like 90 percent all the way there nice
rubber ducky chillin on the SSD yeah I
like how it sort of matches like there's
like it's not the painted wing it has
like a green oh it's a surfboard maybe
it's got glasses yeah okay and the
surfboard actually matches your your RGB
lighting which is fantastic the yellow
sticks out a little bit but you know
yellow and green kind of complements
each other green is sort of a yellowish
based color so yeah we're talking about
a rubber duck in someone's computer
right now we also have very nice sleeve
cables I feel like they could be trained
a little bit they seem a little frazzled
there maybe you could tighten them up
with some additional cable ties or I'm
sorry
trainers cable combs and I think
everything else looks pretty good cable
management is like a 9 out of 10 you
know I feel like things could be tucked
away a little bit better on the PCIe
from your graphics card and again just
tidying it up tidying it up it also
looks like you've got your radiator at
the front for your AI yo the fans doing
push doing a push configuration that's
that's totally fine I think everything
else is matching really nicely I feel
like your component choice and selection
seems really it seems to mesh really
well I like how you have that gray
knocked to a fan at the back of the case
that really matched
the gray accents on your motherboard I
think I think that was well thought out
there is a bit of orange on your SSD
that's on the power supply shroud which
you know you could spray paint that that
that square if you wanted to it's such a
small piece of color that it doesn't
probably it probably doesn't matter much
budget green but if you're all about the
details finer details making it green
like Paul suggested or some other
matching color would be very easy
because it's just a square it's very
easy to mask off it would take you no
time at all not much effort but
altogether a very nice system I feel
like you're you're AI Oh tubes are a
little bit wacky coming from the water
block I feel like I've seen it look
cleaner coming off of that particular
AIO it might be a twist in there that
that it might be unavoidable depending
on you know if you if you are having to
put the rat at the front which I would
recommend I would recommend that you put
your CPU rat at the front when possible
so you know don't worry too much about
it but those are the suggestions that I
had in mind anything Paul no I agree I
think if you did a pass on this case for
aesthetics cleaned up the cables and
your that little green patch on SSD
right it looks it looks really good as
is though yes so thank you thank you
very much next we have nibbly or Devon
hashtag the on our PC AMD arisin v 2600
with an MSI GTX 1050 TI a gigabyte a 320
M s 2h motherboard with a corsair vs 400
psu 16 gigs of DDR 4 Corsair carbide
spec 0 5 case with an NZXT kraken X 52
and a couple drives there alright so I
think we should talk about your actual
hardware first like your your part
selection risin 526 hundred is a
fantastic choice I think if you wanted
to invest any more money into this build
I would suggest getting a faster GPU GTX
1052 tend to GTI is a great value GPU at
least it was back when it was a bit more
relevant but now you can get something a
bit more substantial that's going to
really go a long way in terms of
delivering higher frames outputting more
frames that's also not going to break
the bank something like in RTX 2060 or
perhaps gtx 1660 TI i think those would
both be good options that you could look
at because the risin 5 2600 definitely
has enough juice to to pair nicely with
either of those options you wouldn't be
necessarily super bottlenecked by either
of those choices also you have an a3
a320 motherboard which does not allow
you to overclock that Rison v 2600 so
that's additional free performance that
you're missing out on and if you're so
inclined i would suggest looking into
upgrading the motherboard at some point
to at least a beef be 350 or even
perhaps it be 450 board to really take
advantage fully of that chip because
there's there's a lot of a lot of
performance that you're leaving on the
table and its current state apart from
that the rest of the system looks pretty
good I would say that aesthetically you
definitely need to work on cable
management and I feel like your case I
should say your case is holding you back
in that regard because it's just not a
lot of good routing options in that
speckle 5 that's the that's actually the
case that we used for wifey sauce and
eyes cable management contest recently
because mainly because it was such a
terribly cable management driven focused
case we thought it would be a good
challenge so um could the cooler be
flipped here to put the tubing in the
top you know it's just generally a
better idea for an all-in-one anyway and
yeah and that would maybe allow you to
rotate this 45 degrees so the NZXT logo
would be facing the right direction
yeah and the wiring here would be going
up right you should definitely be able
to do that so thank there that's
definitely possible because that's a
that's an ASA tech cooler that you can
just rotate the bracket we also have a
pretty like this is a 400 watt power
supply which is fine for this build but
if you did any upgrades especially for
the graphics you know that would not be
sufficient right and it doesn't have
good cabling anyway so and then we have
to give a shout out to the 500 gig yes
mechanical hard drive just kind of chill
them down there at the bottom of the
John T 45
thirty degree angle just just chillin
if it's on its side as hard drives are
meant to be if it was an SSD I'd let it
slide a little bit more because there's
no moving parts but this is very unsafe
this is like bad practice especially if
you have valuable files on there aren't
there some mining points behind this
little tray here yeah you have three and
a half inch mounting maybe it was just
like his his cable management was
already so tight he just gave up I don't
know again just plug everything in so it
works another reason to make sure you
have some LED fans to accent yeah things
I guess yeah okay thank you
oh yeah Israel core i7 8700 k with the
cooler master hyper 212 as rock Z 390
motherboard and we have an EVGA GeForce
GTX 770 with four gigs I'm sorry two by
four gigs so eight gigs of team group
ddr4 2400 on the Samsung 970 Evo plus
and looks like we have an H I'm sorry in
NZXT H 200 case so alright so we're
working with the mini ITX here right
like interesting builder yeah like
pretty modern up-to-date processor
that's a hyper 212 black cooler yeah
it's pretty new as well z 390 a
motherboard right graphics card several
generations will hold yeah I believe
that's a 770 classified though yeah good
card yeah I have one of those right but
still like definitely old yeah at this
point um could seriously use an upgrade
there your 8700 K can handle a lot more
yeah we had our a 2 by 4 gig kit of
memory like you definitely want to
upgrade that to use my 8 gigs ideally
yeah I mean yeah that would be good you
got a nice surface D clean looking build
overall the very cable management is you
know with what you're working with you
got a great job there just it seems like
maybe an older system that was upgraded
some
the core components but maybe you
brought the memory and graphics card
over mm-hmm right yeah so well I don't
think we really have any complaints
aesthetically here just that you've got
a couple parts that are kind of showing
their age compared to some of the newer
and nicer components that you have yeah
so you'd like to see those brought up to
snuff
you need some intake fans - there's no
intake there's no one to take - oh maybe
there's one at the bottom that I can't
see but it doesn't look like there's
negative pressure build yeah it doesn't
look like there's a lot of intake coming
from the front at all
so maybe adding some fans as well this
is one of those rare PIP my PC
submissions that is like almost entirely
like all of our suggestions are
functionally based as opposed to form
because the form looks really good it
looks like it's like perfect you know
but it's just a part selection I think
could is what you need to focus on nice
build though yep thank you very much
Israel next up we have mr. chef chef mr.
Shin with an Intel Core i7 6700 K
gigabyte Gaz 170 X motherboard HyperX
fury 16 gigs of DDR 4 with an msi gtx
1070 and other notable specs include a
corsair speck 0 3 tower ok um wow
there's a lot going on here
yeah looks very cluttered dang looks
like it's down on the floor so I'm gonna
give you I'm gonna ding you for that
right off the bat you know but make a
stand get it up off the floor
ok stop oh I get a lot less dust
accumulation over time yeah scuse me
clear some clear white LED fans in the
front that aren't doing you any favors
when it comes to aesthetics yeah
maybe providing a bit of light inside
the case this picture was also taken to
the flash though which is probably not
also doing favors - just I mean hey
we're seeing everything very clearly
yeah
component selection is good we have like
pretty much like an all-black system
with like maybe a little bit of red
accents on the graphics card so if this
was not down on the floor
with a bundle of ugly cables behind it
as the cable management from the friend
the power supply was cleaned up and a
lot of this section excess was tucked
back behind the motherboard tray mm-hmm
if you didn't have like a big ol loop of
cable coming off of your the fan on your
Craig was at h7c yeah h7 this would look
a lot cleaner also point out that your
rear fan is set as an intake has an
exhaust yeah than the point you probably
want to flip that around most
configurations would have that as an
exhaust while you're at it you know pull
everything out and give it a give it a
good cleaning because it looks like it
could use that only yeah all that aside
you can ignore us completely and
probably can continue to use this as a
useful functional computer but hey if
you want it to look pretty you're
sending it into pit my PC we're gonna
tell you what to do to make it look
pretty that's right get off a damn floor
fucking floor stupid be Rockler oh god
damn it
thank you for you thank you very much we
appreciate your patronage med I'm in
there I mean it core i7 9700 k gigabyte
RT x 2080 windforce o NZXT 500 i Kraken
X 52 1 terabyte hard drive still waiting
for the SSD Corsair Vengeance Pro 16
gigs 3200 speed C 398 Pro very very nice
specs what is that motherboard round PCB
motherboard they're doing that with Z
390 what that looks like the most budget
Z 390 board I'd ever seen
why why I mean you see you had money to
spend on a 9700 K and an RT x 2080 why
would you skimp out on such a
entry-level motherboard I mean oh it's
an MSI I mean at least at Z 390 but what
is really the point of buying a Z 390
motherboard if it can probably hardly
overclock better than you know an H what
is it
h/h what's the what's the the non
overclocked version of z 390 i know
there's a couple but i'm trying to blank
right now be 350 then a be 350
motherboard I mean there's like no heat
sinks like pretty much hardly on the vrm
like I'm misleading their product
pictures I mean this is a new egg
product picture of it that looks black
right yeah no it's very misleading black
that looks black then then look at it in
this picture that's brown so proud oh my
gosh cuz I mean when you buy a 9700 K
you bite to overclock because it can be
pushed so far and deliver such
incredible gains with some manual
tweaking but it's all a moot point if
you don't have a motherboard that which
is why it's like why even manufacture a
Z 390 motherboard like this this is a
board of quality for a non case q chip
in my opinion we're also running off of
a hard drive yes he said the SSDs on the
way so they'll be added it's not sure
yet but it's not there yet for hard
drive so that's that's bad you said
there the cat oh yeah there's a cat care
let the cats Brown like the motherboard
maybe he bought the motherboard to match
the cats matches all makes sense at all
it's all connecting the dots nope I
still don't approve yeah you could just
change the motherboard and I would let
everything else slide because that's by
far the worst part about the build it's
very sad that motherboard stands out so
much i I've never even seen that board
before I didn't know that board existed
I feel like I know you all the Z 390
boards and that one this just surprised
me how much money that MSI saved by
having that board be brown no no not
enough not enough to be worth it we got
one more uno mas from late for kid I'm
freaky as every kid has a name B risin
720 700 with a GTX 660 okay and of
course their vengeance lpx ddr4 through
16 gigabytes with a 256 gig WD blue SSD
that is an old GPU even old
then the classified EVGA GTX 770 we just
saw her so and you also have a very nice
CPU Rison 720 700 is definitely no
slouch so I would I would first up my
money I mean screw pimping things out
until you actually have a well-balanced
system upgrade your GPU and you know get
something with him even in the the
250 to 350 dollar range is just gonna
scream compared to that 660 it's gonna
demolish it I'm kind of disappointing
disappointed he didn't list the specs
for as optical drive here like is that a
24 X 32 X oh yeah you're right is that a
read/write combo drive it does look like
we have LightScribe support which I am
very like a fan of that's awesome is
that a light on is that an Asus is that
you know just just fill out the details
here that's what really come on goes to
fit my PC jeez jeez Louise but apart
from that you you could use apart from a
new GPU ketchup and mustard is something
we generally frowned upon here and pet
my PC so if you want to get some
extensions or just a new power supply
probably extensions are gonna be the
cheaper more practical way to go
especially if you have additional room
for cable management the sticker on your
SSD doesn't look all that great with
your color scheme if it was like a blue
and black or white themed build and then
perhaps but I would just remove it just
take a heat gun to it or if you can find
a way to peel it off otherwise that
would just kind of clean it up make it
blend in a bit more with the background
I think everything else looks good I
mean you've got sort of this RGB cooler
right you've got a Wraith cooler on
there as well as a white LED fan at the
rear so maybe going to configure all the
LEDs to whites then you could have sort
of white LEDs with red trim on your
actual case or you can go
I don't know swap that out for a red LED
fan or something like that I'm also kind
of curious what this expansion card is
down there yeah hard to tell
hard to say mmm maybe some additional
USB of some sort I'm not sure but I also
see two mismatched fans at your front
intake those I see a cooler master up
top and a beat quiet fan at the bottom
if you wanted some more uniformity
another
it's a Corsair for the exhaust so Wow
yeah what a yeah combination right yep
get the whole got the whole family there
so I don't know making things more
uniform is generally a good practice for
a cleaner a nicer looking build but
everything else looks looks pretty
decent
and obviously I think you are limited in
your cable management abilities with the
particular case that you're using which
you did not specify so I'm not exactly
sure oh it is a cooler master it's it's
a budget it's an entry level cooler
master case now that I'm seeing the wide
shot so you know if you want to clean up
cable management make it look really
nice and tidy
especially for giving some extensions in
there in the future maybe consider
upgrading your chassis I'm sure you
would get much better airflow as well
because the air intake on this looks
very limited and if you're upgrading
your GPU it's gonna probably run a
little bit hotter than your gtx 660 and
you're gonna want a bit more fresh air
coming through the front but thank you
very much Seifer kid that is gonna
conclude from PIP my PC yay thank you
gracias to everyone who submitted if we
didn't catch you this time maybe we'll
catch you on the next one
that's also gonna conclude it for my
half unless you want to do Q&amp;amp;A we should
do Q&amp;amp;A yeah we yes right yes people
people paid us so you don't have an
after party people gave us money we
don't even have a party today so we're
gonna read off donations and all the
comments that you attach to them
starting with this we the people have
spoken
donated five dollars on Paul's half with
no comment
oh well kind of you thank you we the
people have spoken for not speaking you
know like they say money money talks
true of money and bullshit walks walks
I've never seen bullshit walk usually
just lays there on the ground NB 67 $13
37 cents thank you Mike Paul there's no
way to say this without it sounding bad
but that was a nice video about wooden
standoffs Cheers
oh thank you I'm glad that you
appreciated it
and I learned a lot and I have a few
options for for the future I'm curious
to see I'm interested to see how that
turns out
looks promising I want to move forward
with it quickly
it just keeps being products and
launching stuff hmm that's what I'm
blaming mm-hmm
thank you very much Mike we have 50
Norwegian Crona
from I revealed stolen our youth his
comment says say my name which I'm
saying right now you already said a
yield stolen deal hopefully you don't
get confused with Stalin is that that's
probably not gonna do you much many
favors a hundred a hundred more no
Regent Crona also from re old stolen say
my name again I guess okay
our lil are real Stalin's the one stolen
what what is the homie when it's stole
the name what's the whole stolen what's
the O mean when it's got a slash through
it it means you got to put some stank on
it
a real Stalin Stalin exactly ideal
Stalin
thank you very much every gold Stalin we
got a bastion hope you didn't but you're
too bad crafty hack thanks crafty you'd
have to donate your your moderating we
should be paying you but don't don't
course on that five dollars fun fact fun
baby facts for Paul babies can't taste
salt and have no kneecaps what wait your
baby doesn't have kneecaps yes she does
kind of deformed baby did you birth
she's perfect and every single way
anyway offended that you would even
suggest otherwise the absence of
kneecaps in my firstborn child yes she's
got beautiful kneecaps and shut up
but can she taste salt why all she
drinks his breast milk so why would she
need to taste salt there's no point
let me if she doesn't taste what she
can't taste salt if she can't eat it she
can't taste it
so technically one of those is correct
crafty is only half a liar Thank You
cashew
we love you Eric mmm
Bruin Bruin Ning's and Bennigsen
Eric brunette varenik surroundings and
Eric Bruininks inventing burning Tsin $5
how good are Hugh two air fans currently
using two fractal design 140 millimeter
intakes to mesh if I stock exhausts as
well
can I get positive pressure with three
120 a our exhaust fans and to 140
intakes Eric more or less if you're
using three 120 a our exhaust let's say
you're using three 120 exhausts and to
140 intakes I haven't done the
scientific measurements if I'm speaking
honestly to determine whether or not
it's positive or negative air pressure
my guess is that you're gonna be
somewhere close to neutral air pressure
which is not necessarily a terrible
thing I would just keep a close eye on
your temperatures and as long as those
look good and you're willing to clean
out your your case your chassis every
time it gets too dusty I think your your
safe as as for how good or well
performing the hue to air fans are I've
heard mostly good things about them they
are flashy RGB fans that are destined or
are meant are intended to look good
above all else but I've also heard that
they provide pretty good airflow if
you're using them as case fans I do not
have any recollection of how they
perform as radiator fans or how good the
static pressure is on them so you would
have to do some more research there if
you're planning to strap them to say a
radiator for an AIO or something like
that mesh if I measure you want to give
you a scientific are the closest to a
scientific measurement that I could 320
millimeter fans is a total area of
fourteen thousand four hundred or forty
three thousand I'm sorry
14400 per oh crap I need to choose the
only one here welcome to our new segment
multitasking with Paul anyway point
being thirty-nine thousand two hundred
for the 240s and forty three thousand
two hundred for the three 120 s so the
three 120 should be a bit more in sake
that's just looking at their area so
it's probably incorrect
I'm just putting something quick math
well I'm trying to play it over watch
sure all right well for what it's worth
there you go make make your choice so
sell stop donating damn it damn it so
goddamn it you love yourself
hey Paula thank you for introducing me
to the cooler master 360 triple fans
that is an awesome solution I had to
pick one up
really yeah all right those are that is
a pretty cool product that I think you
nailed it on the head with the title or
thumbnail like why didn't anyone think
of this sooner
yeah like well this is kind of a
no-brainer for me it was very much like
I build systems way like all the time
yeah I died okay
and especially if you're trying to build
the system for a video and get it put
together and get all the lights working
and everything yeah if you got six fans
to connect up even put their on RGB
controls yes that freaking sucks that's
a shit ton so it was so much quicker
right that bill they did to install two
of those yeah versus the alternative so
that is super cool actually and I think
I think in order for that that solution
to have surfaced there needed to be a
great enough problem that existed for
long enough and I feel like adding the
RGB is what really I think
exactly exactly RGB being relatively new
in the grand scheme of things to the PC
DIY market I think you know it
eventually you know at some point that
someone thought that person being
coolermaster yeah we need to optimize
this a bit so very cool product it was a
great video Paul next up we have MB 67
for $13.30 Kyle elite donation to help
feed you and wifey sauce Cheers thank
you very much
I would I would estimate $10 of that
will go to wifey sauce and the three
dollars and 37 cents will go to me
because wifey sauce well
tends to eat more than I do but I seem
to gain twice as much weight as her it's
just not fair
such is life thank you very much Mike I
appreciate the donation as always so
stop it Sal fucker I had I had two ear
muffs this whole episode how was the
show because you know selling is fragile
sensitive ears here see this virgin ears
easily how was the show it was good
you know obviously it would have better
had you listened to all of it
I'm sure their twitch clips surfaces
audio thank you very much yourself
crafty again hey Cathy thank you thank
you crafty you guys don't have to donate
you guys you guys are off the hook
but thank you nonetheless fun facts for
Kyle sea otters hold hands while they
sleep really wow that's so cute that's
very impressive because I I cannot like
even be within remote distance of wifey
sauce when we sleep otherwise I can't
and she's the same way if I just like
sense her breathing if I sense her
existing or living I can't sleep very
well and she's the same way like we
actually put a body pillow in between us
when we sleep because we have a
king-size bed now
and so we have a body pillow in between
us so we had like this little wall when
we say goodnight to each other we have
to like put our heads up over the pillow
be like goodnight all right yes right go
back down because it separates her and I
so that we can sleep better because I
mean you know when people cuz she moves
around a lot
she moves around a lot when she sleeps
like her Buttle being like my side like
a thorn in my side I'm pretty still you
know I mostly I don't really move I'm
like a rock but chill just like you know
flying around or whatever I see that's a
word and it's terrible so sea otters
being able to hold hands while they
sleep
it's like someone like cuddling you know
while they're asleep
I don't know how couples do that some
cuddle some couples cuddles some couples
just like embrace each other while they
sleep and they can just sleep the whole
night while they're there arms are
around each other and stuff like thank
you I can't even well my wife needs to
be literally dead that's one of those
things that like you sort of idealized
when you're younger and then when you
actually like hook up or whatever and
you're in a situation where you're lying
down next to someone right and you both
want to sleep you realize like this is
completely impractical I cry like
hugging and embracing the whole time yep
I need to move around and stuff exactly
we know it's one of those misconceptions
I got to put a barrier in between us
though you might posed to be very
violence and hurt her Nate through she
is or whatever she's literally woken up
in the middle of it was really weird
this actually happened she woke up
no I shouldn't say she woke up I woke up
and I looked at her and we were both
laying down bare in mind our heads Reich
we're laying down on the bed I opened my
eyes and she's staring right at me her
eyes are open she's looking directly at
me and it's it's like the first thing I
see when I wake up and I'm like half
asleep I'm just tired so I'm just like
looking at her like waiting for her to
say something or do something and out of
nowhere she just like raises her arm and
just karate chops me in the in the in
the forehead
she karate talked me in the head and
then she closes her eyes and goes back
to sleep
and I was so confused I was like what
literally just happened and when I went
back to sleep and after an hour we both
woke up I was like so what was that all
about why did you did you remember like
chopping me in the head
she had no oh actually she said that in
her dream she was dreaming she had a
dream that she was cutting a sandwich in
half and apparently I was the sandwich
just after head with that but it was so
bizarre because her eyes were wide open
and she was looking straight at me so I
thought she was awake and that's that's
why we had a body poem between us when
we sleep now is for my protection
they look somebody who knows that I'm
playing on your account is in this game
with us Wow oh hi Paul
code code is here that's awesome all
right sorry for that tangent let's move
on Logan G for ninety nine
recommendations for the best 1440p IPS
monitor available cool 1440 IPS oh I
feel like that markets so saturated now
I don't even know what that's a good
question I don't have the answer to it
off the top of my head I don't either um
go to brands but I mean you can even
find like you know like brands that
aren't super top-tier but are still
really good value like AOC or even like
a lot of Korean Korean based companies
are being super competitive with their
1440p IPS displays yeah that's about
obviously Acer Asus even guys like msi
and now gigabyte are starting to like
output and release new monitors that are
ready we got a pharmacy going up here
woo gigabytes gigabytes for
40p IPS monitor is really nice the one
that I that we saw at CES earlier this
year fall oh yeah that has just like a
ton of OSD features and just like a
gamut of a gamut of options well done
but there's just there's so many options
out there that I can't really grab
something as a gamut because una Gama
Gama - damn it's tricky Pharmacy shut up
I wish I could provide more information
for you Logan's but there's information
out there I'm sure Stephen five five
great British pounds hi Kyle glad you
enjoyed your holiday shame couldn't be
longer just upgraded my 4770k and gtx
980ti to a 3600 and gtx 980ti for four
hundred great British pounds and I'm
loving it thanks for getting my name
right yeah I got your name right because
I've been pronounce your last name mr.
Guerra MOG I'm sorry I just butchered it
right there but nice I would honestly
say I hope you kept that that 4770k
because it probably has higher IPC at
least then the rise in 3600 potential
yes I would I would assume so and so if
if possible I would also see how that
1080i performs with that CPU because
it's still really good unless of course
you're doing workloads that require
multi-threaded situations like you know
editing streaming then the 3600 is a far
better option for sure but either way it
sounds like you're you're living the
good life right there with that system
so congratulations on it I hope it
serves you well for years to come
I'd love you $5 little view I want to
mod my case with a custom 5 and 30 to 5
and 5 and I have 30 seconds of an in
5/32 7 inch tempered glass panel do you
think strong magnets would be a good way
to attach the chassis no and it seems a
little sketchy unless unless the
system's never moving I used I used the
tape from the M&amp;amp;P CTEK sent me hmm right
it was like this crazy double-sided kind
of taped configuration thing yeah stop
shooting me
I don't know magnets would be the best
way to attach glass to it
might be hard I don't think so I mean
it's it's like potential to find a way
to mount it more securely because
magnets are just a little unreliable not
not quite as secure unless you're just
never ever moving the system but good
luck with that
machole $5.00 when I first bought my
Google home I was telling my friend how
much I loved it and she interrupted and
said thank you
which really freaked us out that is
that's another scary story really creepy
add it to the list really creepy and
creepy
Sparky Santos $4.99 no comment thank you
very much Sparky have us Farkle is just
dick Alaba Alaba Alaba Alaba one five
six five British pounds good AIO cooler
recommendations under $100 I would like
to toy around overclocking with my rise
in 2700 acts good AO
for under 100 bucks I would suggest a 20
240 millimeter radiator and minimum look
for NZXT crack in X 62 that you can get
like on a discount but because I have a
beat two of it and that first version is
pretty good oh yeah it's 280 millimeter
yeah maybe one of the older Corsair
models they do have some of the older
Corsair models on sale sometimes like H
100 I or something like that you can
potentially look at those honestly a lot
of the the good 240 millimeter AOS that
are just like standard ASA tech brands
they're very similar across the board
the only real differentiator is it is
the fan situation so whatever fans that
they're using which doesn't honestly
have doesn't create a huge difference
between those coolers so if you can find
a good 240 millimeter ASA tech OAM based
cooler I would say go for it I know deep
cool usually has a lot of good sales on
there like their captain X 240 coolers
and those have been known to do really
well
pretty decent quality as well yeah a lot
of people in chat are also saying deep
cool captain 240 but there's there's a
lot of options
out there so take your pick Mike but it
didn't
$5.00 how y'all do it which is better
ACS 10:50 TI or XFX 574 G wait what XFX
RX v 74 G or Asus GTX 1050 TI wait what
oh like our five-seven yeah like a
Radeon ABM Radeon rx 573 to the 4
gigabyte or an Asus GTX 1050 TI I can't
think off the top of my head which one's
better again it's actually that's
probably got this one in the bag but my
inclination is 10 M TTI unless you can
find a better deal for the rx 570 so I
would say it just kind of boils down to
the price good because I feel like that
the performance is fairly comparable but
again chat might be able to have some
some better insight on that 574 the
price and overclock yeah I mean there's
those two cards the thing about them is
that they're very old by now so there's
gonna be there's bound to be good sales
on those cards so I feel like whichever
one has the best bang for the buck as
far as like sales that you can find at
the moment that's a that's a good place
to start and also power efficiency is a
concern or it can be concerned as
someone in chat pointed out if if you
don't want it to draw as much power than
the Nvidia option is gonna be a bit more
power efficient look for the prices for
a budget entry-level card like that
price is priority so look look for some
good deals especially as we gear up
towards the holiday season next up we
have Matt s for $10 a matt gtx 980ti
is it too old now no I think so no not
at all
I feel like at night ATI is probably
comparable to like a gtx 1070 if I'm
sort of guesstimating which is still
like a 1070 is still a really good card
that's much faster than the majority of
GPUs that most users are using right now
so I feel like it's your gonna be good
for 1080p and even 1440p gaming feel
like things you'll be really missing out
on are the more modern up-to-date
features like you know on the nvidia
side anyway ray tracing and dl SS if
you're interested in those things then
maybe you should consider upgrading but
for the most part of 90 TI is still
going for a good good price like you can
still like sell your 90 TI for a good
amount and they're still really good
really good GPUs even though they're a
few years old now trough TRO Papa trip
up $10 high core i7 3770k our tia I'm
sorry GTX 16 60 TI 32 gigs of memory
while playing video games that I've been
playing for years without issue I now
get freezing lag for a few seconds every
few minutes plus operating system lags
please help
I didn't mean to press that button wait
what he's been playing with his hardware
for a while now but now he's getting
freezing lag for a few seconds every few
minutes he also gets operating system
lags gosh I that situation if there's
somebody changes the hardware I would
always you know potentially take a look
at I finally got him with the church
update all your drivers make sure all
drivers are up-to-date I would consider
like a system restore like yeah honestly
the first thing I would do is update all
my drivers then if it's still persisting
I would try swapping out the memory just
to see because memory is the easiest
thing to troubleshoot and it's also a
very common part to fail so swap out the
memory dude do you know Windows
Microsoft Men check if that checks out
really then try doing four other things
you know try swapping out the GPU for
something temporarily and then if all
else fails try doing it a clean white
try doing a clean wipe on the drive
fresh install clean install of Windows
if it still persists and also make sure
that your BIOS is up to date I should
that should be one of the first things
that you check as well BIOS is up today
because I mean if you're if you're using
a 37 70
you've got an old z77 motherboard
probably and you're putting in a you
probably some fresh 32 gigs of memory as
well as a gtx 660ti this is very old
hardware it matched with very new
hardware make sure that your BIOS is up
to date along with your chipset drivers
and all that jazz that should be the
first thing you check because it's also
the easiest thing to update and then go
through all those other steps that I
that I mentioned and the very very last
option is maybe there's just some
corrupted windows 32 files and registry
file that's either corrupted or missing
that could benefit from a clean install
and if that doesn't work then throw your
computer in a fire pinion yes watch it
burn any glass suggestions ideal yeah
good luck though thank you that's Pete
Thank You Kyle for others suggest of
course next time we have a $10 donation
from frontsies Cody yeah see Skoda yes
I'm thinking about building a new gaming
computer should I wait in Cisco for the
next graphics card or get the GTX or I'm
sorry the RT x20 ATT I also should I
wait for the 39 50x CPU mad props for by
video card to the kid oh thank you I
think he means I'm the best bye video
yes that was very fun I'm glad he
benefited from that um let's see I think
you should it's very little information
here I'm curious to see what what
hardware you're currently rocking
because I don't know if you absolutely
need a 20 atti right now if you do I
mean you're prepared to spend a pretty
penny to say the least should you wait
this is there's not enough information
to go on
if budget is not an option you're
looking for the best of the best at 39
50 X when it when it's finally available
in a 28 ETI
I mean you've just prepared prepare for
everyone to just immediately jizz on
your computer like wrap it like laminate
it so that all the jizz remember one
around you doesn't just completely
saturate the components and infiltrate
all the circuitry until it dies it
happens dies a dizzy death more often
than you'd expect
absolutely how'd it happen last week but
if if budget is a concern then you don't
really need all that
you know to go crazy you can you know go
with an RT X 2060 super which is plenty
fast for 1080p and 1440p gaming you
could go with the risin risin 5 3,600
perhaps there would be a nice pairing
for that if you're doing more content
creation workstation application stuff
then perhaps consider the 3900 X because
those additional threads will do some
favors in that department but all you're
thinking about is gaming and you know a
little bit of streaming a little bit of
content creation on the side 30 3600 X
I'm sorry 3600 would be my go-to choice
and RT X 2060 super or you can consider
let's not let's not ignore the value
proposition that a Radeon rx 5700 or
5700 XT also provides so look at the
benchmarks look at the bunch marks from
all your favorite youtubers like me and
Paul and others and make a decision good
luck aaron gross gross gross gross
aaron g $10 what would you recommend as
a good gaming setup for people who
travel often such as a gaming laptop or
mini ITX to plug into hotel tvs take it
from me who is someone who loves mobile
gaming and mobile PC in mobile PC
computing
I love taking devices on the go I love
traveling with my tech a laptop is just
infinitely easier and this is saying a
lot from someone who is just a complete
sucker for a mini ITX system ya know I
we've attempted multiple times like
building little computers to bring on
with us on trips and stuff like that
yeah but at the end of the day that you
know you you can build the tiniest
little gaming PC that you want look like
a pico PSU and you name it like the
smallest little you know small
form-factor build imaginable but will
really gets you when you're really
traveling and you really want to
optimize the efficiency and the ease of
use what really gets you isn't the PC
itself it's the peripheral auditor it's
the perfect peripherals like the monitor
and the keyboard and mouse having those
three things I know it doesn't sound
like much but it is a pain in the ass to
have a separate carrying case especially
if
gotta like determine alright what's
gonna be a carry on and what's gonna be
a check baggage and am i comfortable
with putting this gear as a check
baggage you know where it could
potentially get damages it protected
enough a laptop is just infinitely
easier in all regardless and you know if
you get a really high end unit it can
probably do a fantastic job it can do
adequately for what you need it for
so take it from me if you want just like
the fun the fun factor and you you enjoy
the challenge because I do enjoy the
challenge of having just like a
full-blown gaming desktop PC on the go
if you're really just kind of if you if
you enjoy making your life a bit more
complicated for the sake of a little fun
which is a very niche category
I'll admit then then go for it you know
I encourage it but if you're just
looking for a no headache solution
laptops are the way to go man all right
let's move on to johnson Johnson Johnson
Johnson hey how you doing over there you
know yeah oh I've been doing very well
at overwatch so far that's okay you know
yeah Johnson shoutouts updates there we
go yes from Hawaii thank you very much
Robert got the glass got the English but
less big old Johnson for you Robert
mm-hmm Jeanne V from Texas also gets a
Johnson got the woman's black thumbscrew
