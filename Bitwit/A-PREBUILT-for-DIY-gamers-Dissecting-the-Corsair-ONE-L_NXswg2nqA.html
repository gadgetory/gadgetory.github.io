bye what's going on guys welcome back to
the channel hope you're all doing well
today I'm going to be doing sort of a
laid-back and casual review of the
Corsair one so sorry if this video is a
little bit lengthy it's not scripted at
all so I might tend to digress like J
bit in the midst of all this but if you
were in the market for a more concise
and detailed review of the Corsair 1
I've linked some videos in the
description below from my good youtube
friends so go ahead and check that out
but yeah we're going to talk about this
thing talk about what makes it special
and all that and whether or not it's
worth the money for starters this is a
pre-built system and before you just
instantly exit out of the video go out
pretty dope
mad nasty horrible there are some very
special things about this rig that set
it apart from a conventional small
form-factor pre-built the first of which
is that it is using a custom mini ITX
case however the components inside are
all using standard form factor which
means you can technically upgrade this
thing and we're going to talk about that
more in detail later on the other cool
thing about this system is that the
particular model I have here with me
today is actually rocking a water-cooled
CPU and GPU which is pretty impressive
considering the small footprint that
Corsair has managed to fit this all in
and we'll see exactly how they did that
in just a moment but we're talking about
12 liters of volume capacity here it's
very small you could fit this in the
backpack it'd have to be a larger
backpack but you could do it it's a
little heavy very possible though it's
super portable especially for all the
power that's in here this particular
model runs for $2,300 which is a bit on
the steep side this specific model is
the Corsair
one pro web store exclusive which means
you can only purchase it from the
Corsair website and it's actually one of
four different hardware loadouts that
you can choose from I think it's the
second highest tier there's one above it
that feature the GTX 1080p eye and
there's two more models beneath it
with lesser specs of course this one is
actually featuring a GTX 1080 still very
powerful a full-fledged the full-fledged
desktop GPU as well as a 7700 K core i7
from Intel and again both of those are
water-cooled which is pretty awesome and
we've also got 16 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance lpx ddr4 that's running at
2400 I believe and we've also got a 960
gig SSD that is SATA 3 so it's not nvme
but for most users if you're not doing
like some some hardcore professional
workstation applications then you're
probably good with SATA 3 we'll take a
look at the other specs later on but for
now let's talk about the case and sort
of the exterior for one it's it's super
it's totes gorge it's totes gorge guys
it's a it's a very nice looking case
looks even better in person I watch the
videos and other reviews and like yeah
it looks pretty nice and then seeing it
in persons like whoa that's that's a
pretty sexy that's a pretty sexy pretty
belt right there it's actually got full
aluminum paneling around the sides it's
black aluminum you actually get these
really nice blue aqua blue LED strips on
either side that can be disabled but
they're not RGB who knew that Corsair
still made non RGB components here in
2017 and honestly I don't even mind that
it's not RGB like at all in fact I kind
of like that it's just one color it sort
of identifies and brands the products
like when you see those aqua strips you
instantly know that it's the one so to
speak front diode we've got a nice power
button that has a nice click too it's
very high quality we've also got a
single HDMI 2.0 be at the front if
you're into VR and one USB 3 port I
would have liked to see a second one
especially for users of including myself
that sometimes use peripheral devices
having a you know a USB receiver plugged
into one port it's nice to have a second
one if you want to just quickly pop in a
flash drive or something like that but
what can you do one will have to do for
now there's also no front panel audio
which I thought was kind of strange I
personally am NOT a fan I try to avoid
front panel audio at all costs but for
users who are into that and use it often
up kind of a bummer we've also got
ventilation on both sides we'll talk
about that in a second moving on
into the back here trying to get
fingerprints on this thing the thing is
a fingerprint magnet by the way but if
you can manage to keep it clean
it looks fantastic just thought I'd
point that out so we've got our usual
fanfare of audio jacks s/pdif out two
threads where you can connect some Wi-Fi
antennas a clear CMOS button which is
really nice actually
you get the ethernet 3 USB 3 ports a USB
3.1 type-c port 2 USB 2 s and a ps2 port
for an old-school mouse or keyboard and
there's also three video outputs that's
definitely not referenced GT x 1080i oh
but of course we do have the one HDMI on
the front hence why we only have three
at the back which is probably good
enough for most users you get two USB
I'm sorry that's two DisplayPort 1.4 s
and one HDMI 2.0 B and the AC plug of
course at the bottom there's also this
button at the top which which allows you
to sort of release the top grille aha ah
yeah you're probably wondering about
that weren't you so there's a 140
millimeter Maglev fan right at the top
there and it's the only case fan in the
entire chassis believe it or not so it's
actually exhausting hot air up and out
of the case which means it's bringing
fresh air through the side ventilation
on either side this case is actually
designed in such a way where there's two
chambers one chamber for the GPU and the
other for the CPU and motherboard and so
there is ventilation on both sides so
either side is getting ample airflow
which is nice let's take an actual
closer look at at the internals I think
that's where things get really
interesting with the Corsair one and I
also want to mention that it's super
quiet right now because we're idling of
course but also because we only have one
case fan and it's a 140 it's a maglev
it's super high quality so this is
probably going to be a fairly quiet mini
ITX PC which you generally don't hear
too often when it comes to pre build so
but we'll do an acoustics test soon
enough let's go ahead and open Y put
back on let's just pop this sucker up
again alright maybe I should zoom out
let's change camera angles you can see
what I'm doing here
alright so got my creepy gloves on we're
going to crack this sucker open let's go
ahead and start again by pressing that
button at the back
and releasing the grill is look at the
Maglev fan beautiful there's PWM of
course and you can just unplug it like
that you know I'm gonna I'm going to
power the system down actually I should
have done that earlier I got to say I
like how removing this part was
completely to list it makes it super
easy however you will need a screwdriver
for this next part so either side both
of these side panels on the Corsair one
can fold down giving you access to
either chamber we're going to start with
the CPU and motherboard chamber and for
that you will need again a screw driver
there are two screws only two though I'm
glad there's only two nice standard
Phillips head screws none of that
hexagonal crap come on screw I believe
in you oh Jesus okay make sure that you
make sure you put your hand and you're
ready to catch the panel when it falls
like that so that it doesn't fall like
that so here we get our first glimpse as
to how exactly Corsair is gone about
water cooling their CPU we've got our
water block with the built-in pump two
tubes very short tubes to fit everything
nicely connected to a slim 240
millimeter radiator and the rad is
actually just flush with the side panel
so you get really nice fresh intake
going through that rad and the rest of
the system very nice design overall this
more or less functions like a regular AO
water block so you could theoretically
pop this off and swap in a different CPU
of course with LGA 1151 and a 7700 K
there's not really much of an upgrade
path there but say I don't know
something terrible happens to your CPU
you swap it out you could do so or you
could just swap out the entire
motherboard and just install like a
completely new platform if you wanted to
this motherboard in particular is e2 70s
so obviously we can overclock there's
actually a pretty fatty heatsink on the
v RM so I'm pretty sure we can dial in a
hefty OC we've also got both of our
memory modules populated there one thing
I want to mention about the motherboard
I believe watching the other reviews
that there is an m2 slot at the back of
the board I can't recall if it's PCIe or
SATA or both I'll make an annotation or
something but that is an option of
course it would be kind of a pain to get
to since it's behind the board you'd
have to either take out the entire board
or maybe you could access it from the
GPU chamber if you remove the graphics
card but I'm not too sure about that
however here's a peek at your m2 m2 your
FSA your two and a half inch SATA 3 SSD
and here we have our 400 watt SFX power
supply of corsair branding look at what
they've done with the wiring here it
looks like a thinner gauge sort of a
custom wiring job here and the cable
management is superb guys like theirs it
keeps a lot of open rooms so the airflow
can more easily flow through the case
which is really nice so good job on your
Corsair for that if we look at the top
really quick there's your power switch
and you can see that they're using the
power and AC pass-through to go to the
bottom back of the case and also there's
some pass throughs for your video outs
on the video card which we should take a
look at now let's let's do that let's
put this back up and then we'll crack
open the other side one screw and I'm
going to catch it this time yeah man
yeah you know and here ladies gentlemen
is where the video card lies it's not an
honest one and we get a very similar
configuration as we saw with the CPU
we've got our water block with a
built-in pump some short tubing going to
a slim 240 millimeter radiator up
against the side panel and you'll notice
that the GPU is really the only part of
the card that's being cooled by liquid
everything else is either passive or
actively cooled by air you can see that
there's actually a blower style fan
right here that's on the VRM or that's
you know covering the vrm area so that's
kind of nice you you're getting
dedicated water cooling just for your
GPU we've also got a very smart
implementation of a PCB that connects
the graphics card via it's pcie 3.0
connector and wires it to the
motherboard on the other side and here
you can see we've got some pass-through
cables going from all four of our video
outs on the graphics card to this module
down here sort of a custom a custom
design that gives us the three video
outs that we saw on the back of the case
earlier now when I first saw how this
was all laid out I was pretty unsure of
whether or not you could upgrade the
graphics card because honestly if you
couldn't that would be a huge deal
breaker for me personally especially if
you're spending this kind of money on a
prebuilt I want to be able to upgrade it
in the future I don't want it to just
have a dead stop when it gets too slow
and I have to buy a completely new
system so fortunately it looks like you
probably can upgrade the video card this
looks like just a regular two slot card
that the rear i/o is just a two slot
design so you can pop in another
however I don't know how easy it would
be to actually transfer the cooling
system onto another graphics card it
would have to be one of a similar board
has a similar PCB layout for sure but
that being said I just would have to try
it myself in order to find out which I'm
not going to be doing today what's more
feasible most likely is just taking the
entire card and the cooling system out
and putting in just a regular air-cooled
GPU but the downside would be that you
would be losing out on this beautiful
cooling system which means you would
probably be introducing a bit more noise
into the equation especially if you're
using a blower style card I would
recommend that getting up track here
you probably can upgrade to a different
video card later down the line I'm going
to say that's possible
however you're probably going to also
need to be very careful with what you're
doing you need to know what you're doing
because if you mess up you are going to
be voiding your warranty by upgrading in
the first place and course there won't
be able to help you so just make sure
you do your homework in your research
before you start diving in to swapping
things out and things like that but the
fact that you can upgrade this is so
huge and makes this so much more
valuable as a product to me because
again Corsair has done a really good job
and made a smart choice to use standard
form factor components so that is pretty
awesome I think on that note let's
actually hook this up I want to power
back up again because it looks so pretty
with those LEDs and let's just see how
it performs let's just check out some
thermals some acoustics and we'll
benchmark it and maybe overclock it I
don't know do we have time for all that
we'll see we'll see what we get through
let's listen to it alright ladies and
germs we are in the BIOS you can see
it's the msi UEFI because of rocket and
MSI motherboard of course this is a good
a good BIOS I'm very familiar with it
I've used countless z2 70 MSI boards up
till this point and it's a it's good
unified I do like it it's well organized
and well thought-out too easy to find
everything and you can do some
overclocking with it as well we're going
to hold off on that just for now because
I want to see what the temperatures are
just at the default settings with turbo
boost enabled on our 7700 K but here's
all the tweaking options available to
you so I'm just going to go ahead and
jump into the
OS all right so here we are in the first
level of GTA 5 just rollin through some
streets with good old Franklin and right
off the bat we can see that we've got
our rated we're hitting our rated
frequency our turbo of 4500 mega Hertz
on the CPU and temperatures are looking
in the range of the 70s I would say we
we have already spiked up to 83 degrees
C which is kind of warm nothing to be
alarmed of still beneath the maximum
temperature threshold for the 7700 K
however temperatures could be chillier
and this sort of makes me a little weary
to get into some overclocking just
because I know that if we bump up the
voltage any we could potentially see
even higher temps and I wouldn't want to
push it much further so I would
overclock at your discretion I've
already sort of dabbled with some CPU
overclocking before filming this shot
and I was able to get 4.8 gigahertz at
one point to three volts stable and that
playing the same level in GTA 5 I was
actually spiking up to 86 degrees C and
that was you know not not a constant
8086 C but it was definitely hitting
back every once in a while so it depends
on how comfortable you are with with
certain temperatures and just sort of
where you want your system to to level
at I'm pretty happy with 83 C right here
I don't think I would overclock much
just because at the end of the day
you're probably not going to notice a
difference in gaming performance anyway
it's just sort of you know it would have
been nice to have a bit more thermal
Headroom to push our CPU a bit further
especially for all you enthusiasts out
there who like to overclock for the
thrill of it which is totally
understandable but our GPU on the other
hand this is our GT X 1080 right now is
running stock have not touched it at all
and we're at a chilly 53 or 55 degrees C
we're in the mid 50's which is
phenomenal so where the CPU thermals are
lacking a bit the cooling system on the
GPU is doing its job very well so kind
of makes me want to overclock it which
we should do
now alright guys so here we are in
Unigine heaven 4.0 you can see I've
maxed out our power and temp target
sliders and dialed in a pretty decent
core o'clock offset of 240 megahertz a
more moderate offset on our memory clock
of 150 megahertz
bringing us to 2075 point 5 megahertz
just south of 2.1 gigahertz guys at 61
degrees Celsius holy moly that's it's
working awesome you would have to spend
an arm and a leg just to get a GPU of
this caliber running at these speeds at
that temperature so the fact that
Corsairs managed to do this in such a
small footprint is really a testament to
the engineering and design of the
cooling system on that video card if
only the the CPU cooled this well then
it would just be you know 10 out of 10
and all that sort of thing but this is
still really impressive guys so plenty
of overclocking Headroom to be had on
the video card in the Corsair one but
we're not finished yet ladies and
gentlemen the surprises keep on coming
let's talk about acoustics first of
which I can barely hear the system while
it's running you know it's been running
image in heaven for about 10-15 minutes
now and it is just quiet
I mean it's audible you can hear it but
it's too low hum and you know against my
my little window AC unit it's it just
fades into the background it's just so
it's very graceful so here's a sound
test idle and load acoustics for your
viewing or your hearing pleasure
suffice to say I am completely stunned
just at how quiet this thing is and how
cool it is at least for the GPU and
finally before we close things out I
wanted to give you guys a quick look at
gaming performance obviously that's what
most people who buy this thing are going
to be doing most of the time is playing
games and here we have GTA 5 at 2560 by
1440 MSAA is disabled however all the
other settings are completely maxed out
draw distance texture quality etc
shadows and I'm not going to be doing
any further hard benchmarks on this
thing you guys are already pretty
familiar with the performance of the GTX
1080 and the 7700 K even when paired
together that's been exhaustively tested
so but here just to show that you are
getting you know DIY desktop grade
performance here at around 80 fps and
granted this is a very textured scene
with a lot of a lot of draw calls and
stuff way out in the distance but in the
cities I was getting around 100 FPS easy
where it's a little bit more populated
with buildings and stuff again this is
just a really smooth experience you
would you wouldn't notice that it's a
prebuilt of any kind also the bloat
where there's like there's like no
bloatware I mean it does like a few
Corsair apps maybe an MSI app or two but
nothing too intrusive I just wanted to
point that out but yeah the gameplay on
this thing is just absolutely killer so
on that note let's go ahead and wrap
this video up with some closing words
alright so where to begin with this
fantastic product there's honestly so
much to love about it but there's a few
shortcomings as well so I'll go down the
list of pros and cons as we wrap things
up here first of which is I love how
portable it is you can literally take it
anywhere and it's versatile as well you
can use it as an HTP see if you have
room in your home entertainment center
which you wouldn't need much room to fit
this and it would look really nice at
the same time you could use it as a
workstation PC plop it right next to a
nice big 4k monitor and do some editing
I mean you can pretty much do anything
with this PC this is like what I wanted
might go anything or go anywhere do
anything PC to be this is like what that
computer aspires to it's powerful as
hell obviously with the current
configuration GTA X 1080 70 700 K it
just screams through games that we don't
really need to expand on that much GPU
thermals are absolutely bonkers I mean
60 degrees Celsius under load while
overclocked heavily overclocked mind you
is just insane
if you were to tweet the voltage of it
you could probably hit easily hit 2.1
gigahertz on the card no problem noise
profile is also fantastic this is again
one of the quietest letting on
okay let me cue everyday play wives it
is so quiet though I honestly can't get
over how quiet the one is and it it
truly is a thing of beauty it really is
but another cool thing about this
product is that there's only one support
team you have to deal with Corsair of
course it doesn't matter if your CPU
graphics card motherboard SSD whatever
goes wrong you just call up Corsair as
opposed to if you're doing it yourself
you've got potentially 8 to 12 different
manufacturers that you have to go
through if you have an issue warranty
problems etc so that is a nice
convenience and perhaps my favorite
feature about the one is that it is
upgradable and granted the GTX 1080 is
going to last you quite some time but
eventually it will get slow and you'll
want to swap it out for another two slot
card you'll be able to do that fairly
easily and I'm going to say fairly
easily and here's where we start to go
to some of the cons some of the
shortcomings of the one is that since it
is a custom case upgrading it and
servicing it is going to be a little bit
more tricky than just a regular DIY
build so you want to bear that in mind
and it will also void your warranty so
all you wort warranty voyeurs out there
who don't give an F that's probably fine
for you but for those of us who might
still want to hang on to that just for
peace of mind if you do upgrade your
system you are going to miss out on a
warranty but other things to note here
the front i/o is a little bit lacking I
would like to see an additional USB 3
and perhaps an audio jack at the front
not a huge deal maybe for some CPU
thermals were a little bit underwhelming
I would have really liked to be able to
push that 7700 K to at least you know
four point eight five gigahertz and
still maintain you know temperatures in
the low 80s at the very most but
unfortunately we were not able to do
that so that is kind of a downer it kind
of tricks you right you see the case
give you like an unlimited potential but
that's not quite the case here and then
finally this is a little bit pricier
than if you were to build a similar rig
yourself of course
you're gonna be sacrificing several
things by building it yourself which
usually it's the other way around right
if you're if you're getting the pre
build then there's certain things you're
missing out on but honestly
thermals and and silence you're getting
all that in this pre-built package
granted for about 25 to 30 percent more
than what you could buy equivalently on
your own but damn it's it's a solid
product that's undeniable and I would
give it a full recommendation assuming
you have the funds and if you're you
know if this is the sort of product that
you need it's the one you should get for
sure but I think that's it those are all
the things I want to say about the
Corsair 1 co flea you guys enjoyed this

of unscripted off-the-cuff hopefully you
