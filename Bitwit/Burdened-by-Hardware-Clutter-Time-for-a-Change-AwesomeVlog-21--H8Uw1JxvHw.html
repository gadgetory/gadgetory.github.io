sorry I apologize at this video within
60 FPS I know some of you get a real
hard-on for that that's because I'm use
them a vlog camera the rx100 m3 and it
only does 30 FPS at the 1080 so it's a
piece of but today we're gonna be
dealing with that thing behind me yeah
my product shelf it's got a bunch of
crap on it I got this oh maybe oh just a
month or two after I moved into this
place like a year or two ago so it's
been here a while but it used to look a
lot more organized than it does now
here's a close look at it originally I
had it all divided into sections it's
like the bottom shelf would be power
supplies the second it would be
motherboards and video cards peripherals
and so forth and since then it's just as
you can see things are out of boxes it's
just kind of become a mishmash of
anything goes anywhere and that's that's
definitely all my fault I mean I have no
one else to blame but there are a couple
things that have helped contribute to
that clutter as well for example a lot
of these boxes are empty and you know
that I just got a lot of hardware in the
hardware gets used and put into builds
and stuff like that
but then I don't know where to put the
empty boxes so it kind of just takes up
space on the shelf so what I'm gonna
have to do today is take out all this
stuff take it all off the shelf and put
it in two piles on the floor wherever
around my room and reorganize it so I
know what I need to keep what still has
good hardware in it which boxes are
empty that I still need to keep which
boxes are empty that I can throw away
and which things are beer bottles and
then I'll definitely I'll definitely
recycle those yay for the environment
but as you can see this has gotten
completely out of hand over the last six
to eight months however long it's been
since I last organized it there's things
touching the ceiling it's freaking
Maximus 8 formula motherboard just doing
a handstand on the frickin ceiling so
it's not ok this is not okay guys this
is no way to live this is no way for a
tech tuber to organize their stuff so
yeah that's what you guys are gonna be
helping me do today
and Who am I kidding you guys aren't
helping you're just watching me work
bitches but yeah look at I've even had
to resort there's not even any room for
the AP use all the humanity
so on that note we're gonna I have this
other camera set up right here when I'm
not even pointing at it I'm pointing at
you pointing to me pointing to you
pointing at me
so I got the gh4 set on the Shelf looks
so freakin piled high that you can't
even I couldn't even fit the whole thing
in the frame even putting the camera in
the very corner of my room or more or
less just on top of High Line here but
it'll give you kind of an indication to
my progress as we go about showing off a
time-lapse of this whole procedure I'm
gonna hate the next however long this
takes me probably like two three hours
is my estimate maybe more but yeah let's
go ahead and do that now
now cue time-lapse
the
all right and here she is
ain't she a beauty huh yeah all right
looking pretty sweet and much more
organized if I do say so myself I feel a
lot less anxiety just looking at it and
pretty much I kept the layout the same
oh but by the way this took me about an
hour so not as long as I thought it
would but just an hour to get everything
on the shelf I still had to take all the
empty boxes so there are no empty boxes
here all these boxes have their
appropriate piece of hardware in them so
so that way I just add a glance I can
look at the shelf and see what I have in
inventory and this little section right
here from from here going to the right
just on this shelf these are all the
products that I have plans for in the
immediate future so either plan in my
review or some kind of build video I'm
not going to give too much away but
that's that's pretty much what that area
is reserved for and then you know I've
got peripheral stuff here I've got the
CPU and memory hard drives SSDs and a
couple fans they're all on that shelf
CPU coolers are still in the very top
you can see I have plenty of ceiling
room now there is no exorcism going on
on the on the roof there and then I've
also got motherboards here to the left
and video cards over to the right I
don't have a lot of the retail boxes for
my video cards so they're kind of just
chilling here I've also got got that
video card there that should go in the
wifey build I stole that from for my
wife's build to do the last video I did
and then they've got power supplies here
and a couple audio things and
microphones over there but you can see
there's just a lot more room to work
with just definitely looks a lot cleaner
as well as for the empty boxes I pretty
much put them up here all along the top
shelf here kind of organized those as
well so video cards the Intel master box
that was kind of cool and then I've got
more stuff over here motherboards
motherboards for days got CPU coolers up
there and some power supply shenanigans
and just a budget this is just crap this
is this is crap that used to be up on
the shelf and I had to put it down in
this corner I remove some stuff
the garage freakin cases man cases so uh
that's pretty much it I think that looks
that looks nice I'm really happy about
this I think right now I'm just gonna go
crack open a beer and start editing this

but that's pretty much it guys I know I
haven't done a vlog in a while so let me
know if you enjoy this sort of thing I
know it's really you know not it doesn't
have too much substance it's not very
info heavy it's just kind of like
hanging out or whatever but once in a
while after like the vlog is kind of
cool
so if you enjoyed the video go ahead and
toss me a like on it feel free to
subscribe to the channel for more tech
videos coming really soon
like I said that stuff on that shelf
stuff on that show where is it right
there the stuff on that shelf it's gonna
be good
gonna be real good uh-huh all right guys
I'll catch you guys later
see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
