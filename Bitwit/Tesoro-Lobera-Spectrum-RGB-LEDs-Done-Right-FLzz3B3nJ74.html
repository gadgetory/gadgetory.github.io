October I took a look at the Tesoro
libera supreme mechanical keyboard which
impressed me more with its macro keys
and pass-through options than its
underwhelming lighting effects the
rudimentary lighting modes felt
uninspired compared to other RGB
keyboards I'd seen and tunability
options and the software left something
to be desired
fast-forward six months and enter the
Libero spectrum a similarly dressed RGB
keyboard with a whole new bag of tricks
largely thanks to a revamped LED
controller though for as many changes
being brought to the spectrum it hasn't
fallen far from its roots so first I'm
gonna briefly touch on what's been
carried over from the Libero supreme if
you want more information on these
features you can check out my review on
that keyboard somewhere over here so
starting off you still get 105
mechanical keys with Cale switches
available in blue brown red or black
truth be told I find these Cale Browns
which is noticeably harder to press than
their cherry MX equivalents which could
lead to faster finger fatigue during
long typing or gaming sessions the Cale
switches are also louder and give off an
echo a spring noise particularly the
larger Keys like spacebar + Enter for
these reasons I've compared the way I
feel about Cale switches to the way I
feel about Cale and I could see how this
might be a deterrent for those used to
the sound and feel of Cherry MX but
apart from sharing the same switches as
the Lovera supreme the spectrum also has
the same USB 2 + audio pass-throughs
along with an included DC cable for
juicing your USB ports when charging
mobile devices the familiar LED
indicators make their return with PC
mode which disables the wind lock key
and the macro recording button that lets
you record macros on the fly effectively
bypassing the software all
files and settings can once again be
saved on 512 kilobits of onboard memory
and additional features includes 6 + n
key role over two levels of adjustable
incline and the same light yet sturdy
plastic body however not everything
about the frame is identical and I
suppose this is where we switch gears to
what's new about the spectrum the
keyboard now sports an all-black
aesthetic which I think most of us can
agree looks a thousand times better than
the grey Lovera supreme with that
supremely hideous purple trim by the LED
indicators this tells us two things one
the spectrum will likely have no
problems matching the color scheme of
your setup and two - Sora recently
replaced their lead engineer with one
who is in colorblind some they call a
black keyboard unoriginal and boring but
I'll take that over a keyboard
resembling a woman's walking shoe any
day of the week another change of the
keyboard is the omission of the three
macro buttons that were located just
beneath the space bar on the supreme
this was probably a handy feature for
macro centric gamers but the fact that
you can still macro any key on the
spectrum makes this a small step back
for most users while you still get five
custom profiles they've been shifted
over from the f/8 through f12 keys to
the f1 through f5 keys making them
slightly more Within Reach
the up and down arrow keys now serve the
secondary function of five level LED
brightness adjustment while the left and
right arrows toggle through nine
different LED modes which I'll touch on
later slightly improved are the side LED
strips whose color rarely matched the
rest of the keys on the Libero supreme
while there's still a bit dimmer they do
seem to match with key colors more
closely and finally I saved the best for
last
the LEDs themselves are leaps and bounds
better than not only its predecessors
but both of the other RGB keyboards I've
spent the most time with the Logitech G
9 10 and Corsair k70 RGB the LEDs on the
spectrum produced deep rich colors that
get extremely bright even in well-lit
rooms
partially thanks to their external top
mounted design as compared to the
shrouded LEDs on the k70 RGB for example
the spectrums ability to smoothly fade
between colors is also second to none a
feature on other models that exhibits
noticeable flickering but of course an
RGB keyboard is only half Hardware as
its custom software plays an important
role in bringing out the board's full
potential the program is thankfully
small at just 14 megabytes and equally
lightweight using less than 20 megabytes
of system
memory at the top of the window are
buttons for PC mode and your five custom
profiles and just below is a full key
layout where you can begin customizing
clicking on any key opens up several
assignment options located in the lower
left corner the first of which being
macros allowing you to record any number
of keystrokes which you can then
designate their delay time and
repetition key assignment simply
replaces the function of the selected
key to another key of your choosing
you can also set keys to launch specific
programs for increased productivity the
sync program option lets you assign an
application to one of your five custom
profiles and will automatically switch
to that profile anytime the application
is launched this is a great feature if
you like to create unique profiles for
each of your video games for example as
being able to switch between them
autonomously means one less step to
think about in certain situations you
might wish for a key to be disabled
entirely so there's a disabled button
for doing just that there's also a
button for quickly resetting a key to
its default action the illumination
panel is where you can change the
backlighting color of your LEDs using
either the basic preset colors the RGB
numeric values or the narrow spectrum
bar which I would have liked to see open
up into a larger window for more precise
color selection under the lighting
effects tab are the nine LED modes that
I mentioned earlier could be selected
with the left and right arrow keys
standard lights up all the keys on the
board in a single color pretty standard
trigger enables reactive LEDs which
light up for a brief moment when pressed
before gradually fading away ripple
shoots light out in all directions
starting from the depressed key while
firework creates more of an AoE effect
by lighting up the depressed key and all
others immediately surrounding it half
of the keys light up in your designated
backlit color while the other half glow
in a random color predetermined by the
software this was one of my favorite
lighting effects on the spectrum but
it's too bad you don't have the option
to select both colors for greater
customization much like the ripple
effect radiation shoots color out the
left and right but only to the row of
keys in which you've initiated the
keystroke breathing mode creates the
same old breeding effect were used to
but the spectrum manages to pull it off
with impeccable fluidity making it look
like the keyboard is actually breathing
as opposed to just cycling through
incrementally small levels of brightness
the cherry on top would have been an
option for speed adjustment but
unfortunately most of these nine
lighting effects are more or less fixed
rainbow waves initiates the classic
rainbow
effect found on nearly every major RGB
keyboard and I can't stress enough how
buttery smooth the LEDs transition from
color to color another cool thing is at
the floor underneath the keys receive a
ton of secondhand illumination from the
LEDs which really makes the spectrum pop
on your desk with the keyboards
headphone jack plugged in the audio
effect makes the LEDs dance to the sound
of any Tunes you play on your PC while
it's fun to watch your keyboard rave to
the roots and storm the effect starts
diminishing below 50% system volume
making it difficult to enjoy the light
show at lower listening levels and
rounding out the lighting effects is
spectrum colors which allows you to
change each individual key on the board
to a color of your choosing this is
where you can really fine-tune your keys
for different applications game genres
or play styles Tesoro could take a
lesson from logitech on this one by
giving the option to organize keys into
zones instead of having the user assign
key lighting one by one on the bright
side clicking on a key does open up a
larger color window for easier selection
once you've got your colors down you can
have the LEDs shine in either standard
breathing or trigger mode per your
preference while I reckon most users
will be satisfied with the spectrums
lighting options the software itself
experiences frequent crashes and has
some inherently awkward flaws that need
to be fixed for one certain settings
like macros or program launching take an
uncomfortably long time to apply
spanning anywhere from 7 to 15 seconds
to take effect
another gripe is that you can't quickly
click from one setting to another
without first exiting the pop-out menu
that the first setting brings up having
to click the exit button before browsing
another setting is counterintuitive
and just flat-out annoying additionally
there's no way to change the color of
the blue LED indicators which might not
match well with the rest of your boards
color scheme a glaring drawback first
edit continuity overall I like this
board a lot better than the Libero
supreme both in form and function the
spectrum keeps all the good stuff from
its older model and brings sweet
redemption in areas that were lacking
the side LED issue has been fixed for
the most part and going all black was a
very smart move I don't think I'll ever
be a fan of kale switches and if there's
any deal-breaker here for me personally
this would probably be it there are a
few decibels too loud and they're just
not as comfortable to type on as Cherry
MX without a doubt this keyboard saving
grace is in the name this
that term of backlit LEDs is what I've
always hoped for in an RGB keyboard in
terms of brightness vibrancy and
performance
unfortunately the killer lighting is
backed by buggy software whose UI and
slowdowns need to be addressed let me
