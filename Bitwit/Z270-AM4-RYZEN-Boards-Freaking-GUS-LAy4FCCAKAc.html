to you by fractal design MSI and cable
mod check out the links in the
description below or I will direct the
next Star Wars film right we're at the
msi booth now taking a look at gus good
old Gus this takes the cake for my
favorite product name at CES 2016 for an
electronic component it's just it's good
it's just so wholesome and fun
I believe it stands for something if you
look at the spec sheet here it's clearly
an acronym but I even asked some people
at MSI they were like we don't know the
hell it stands for so I like us I'm just
gonna keep it like that but basically
what Gus is he's kind of like the core
if you're familiar with it at all but
the core from from razor of course this
is this one's way better you've got a
GTX 1080 in here right now this is an
external GPU enclosure that you can
actually connect to something like the
Intel nook over here via Thunderbolt 3
and essentially run high-end games off
of a relatively low powered system
within a GPU of your choice you can
either do Nvidia or AMD graphics inside
of this thing it does again connect via
Thunderbolt 3 and the way this is
getting powered here is a 500 watt
built-in power supply which is 80 plus
gold certified obviously the Nook can't
drive a GTX 1080 so that's how they
solve the issue there there's also a
couple connectivity options in the back
you do get USB 3.0 type a and type C I
believe there's two type a ports and one
type C port which is always nice to see
you've got plenty of ventilation at the
top here and it's just a kind of nice
looking enclosure all around you get a
bit more at the front USB 3.0 at the
front as well and I think a messiah is
saying that this is going to retail for
around $500 that is a little bit on the
steep side however it is it is going to
be offset by a cheaper unity per system
that you'd have to buy the Intel nook is
obviously not super pricey so there's
there's a bit of a give and take there
and I believe we're going to be seeing
this anywhere between q2 and q3 of 2017
thanks Gus you rock alright so now we're
taking a look at MSI's mystic light app
this is an application I have not seen
before but as the name might suggest
this is all about RGB control not just
for your motherboard but for a variety
of components you can see there's quite
a selection here what's actually really
cool about this apart from it being able
to do you know the typical sixteen point
eight million
and having a variety of effects here
actually first up let's take a look at
that lighting effects okay that's just
on and off flashing they've got quite a
few effects here to choose from you can
also do some music selection and
actually have it synced to the music
that you want to play color wheel right
there what I was going to say is cool
about this is that it's actually
compatible with certain other
third-party components so we've actually
got if you look over to the system that
it's connected to that we're running off
of there's some HyperX ddr4 in the
system it's not sudden MSI products that
an MSI motherboard but still able to
connect and communicate with the
software in order for you to pretty much
change it to your heart's content so
we're going to go ahead and select green
well first off we have to select HyperX
dim ddr4 just like that and then let's
just change that to green because green
is awesome and I hit apply and if we
look over here it immediately changes to
that particular effect alright we are
now faced with a wall of motherboards
look at all these boards we're gonna go
through all of them maybe not every
single one but I'm gonna I'm gonna hit
the main ones that are pretty cool first
of all they've got them organized in
these different groups are different
tiers if you will we've got the
enthusiasts gaming series performance
that says arsenal I know the lights
super-bright and then the pro series
which is for professionals so we're
gonna start with the enthusiast series
which is exactly what it sounds like for
the hardcore gamers like a lot of you
guys are out there so this is the Z - 70
X power gaming titanium you guys are
probably familiar with this board at
least the z170 version which is the one
I used in the silver build a couple
months ago for a PC of the month now a
couple nice additions to the Z 270 model
which is triple m dot two slots you get
one two three you can see right there
the one in the middle actually has a
shroud with a thermal pad underneath for
a better dissipation of heat for Drive I
mean sometimes end up two drives if you
use them quite frequently or for long
periods of time can get pretty hot so
that should actually help cool things
down a bit we've also got an
overclocking button here I believe this
was on the the last generation as well
but if you look at the back actually
it's impossible to look at the back
they've got USB 3.1 type C that's Gen 2
actually so none of that
rebranded USB 3.1 stuff this is pure gem
- you can see they're still keeping with
the titanium theme everything looks
really nice and shimmery and stuff why
don't we go ahead and move move on down
to our next board which is the z2 70
gaming m7 now you guys might recognize
this board from a recent video I did on
the cabbie Lake launch or KB like Kate
tomato tomahto
but this is a really nice board I've
actually been enjoying it so far working
with it back at home and some special
things about this other than RGB LED of
course pretty much all over the board
you can turn these off if you so wish
because you know RGB LEDs aren't for
everyone of course we've got an
overclocking button at the bottom just
kind of like we saw with the titanium
there's also a USB 3.1 gen2 motherboard
header right here that is completely
built in it's really nice the titanium
doesn't even have that there's also a
type C version of that on the back also
Gen 2 again I can't really show you that
because it's we're kind of in a corner
here but overall very nice clean
aesthetic we've also got three MDOT 2's
right here as well so if you wanted to
put in triple drives you could also go
into MSI's BIOS and do a raid zero setup
with three of those drives for super
fast storage worth it and you've also
got steel plated turbo u2 right here on
the motherboard next to your SATA ports
fancy and here we have the Performance
Series this is one notch down from the
enthusiast boards I'm still very
full-featured and whatnot but maybe
slightly more affordable as well so
right now we're looking at the Z 270
gaming pro carbon and you can see why
it's called that there's plenty of
carbon-fiber accents both on the chipset
heatsink and the VR vrm heatsink and the
rear i/o shield as well does also
support C is it three-way a three-way
crossfire and 2a nvidia sli which is
pretty nice to see you also get two of
those turbo m2 slots right here with one
of the shield's one shield right there
it does have plenty of RGB LEDs on it
not maybe not quite as much as the m7
but still definitely enough to kind of
give your your chassis and your system a
nice look and feel for customizability
and things like that and look at this
the audio this is audio Tracy Audio
tracing has RGB LEDs in it that's pretty
sweet
and even behind the board all right so
you get kind of a nice effect on the
side of the board and the LEDs are
actually right angled pointed towards
the camera right now so they kind of
emit on to the chassis they don't get
completely blocked by the PCB itself
also in the performance gaming series we
have the Z 270 great gaming and this is
a kind of a mid-range board maybe more
mainstream than some of the other
enthusiast boards we just checked out
you can see it's black and white it's
got kind of a really nice
I don't know it's kind of like an
aggressive winter theme I'm not exactly
sure how to describe it but you don't
see too many white PCBs especially with
this kind of aggressive design so that's
that's pretty interesting I get some
branding on the side there on the i/o
shield or the i/o cover and if you take
a look at the PCIe slots it's probably
the most unique thing about the board is
that these are actually water dipped or
hydro dipped is what they're saying so
they use a water transfer type of
technique to actually spice up the look
of the PCIe slots of course you wouldn't
be able to see this if your graphics
card was installed but most people who
are only going to be having one card in
here you can still see the rest of those
slots there here we have pretty much the
only Mini ITX board on the wall this is
the z170 eye gaming Pro carbon AC as the
name suggests it does come with built-in
AC Wi-Fi you can see the antennas poking
out right there
very nice to see you've also got
carbon-fiber accents on the vrm heatsink
as well as the chipset heatsink and it's
a pretty nice board overall I do like
the fact that it's color neutral it also
has an MDOT 2 slot I don't see it on the
front here which means it must be on the
back so again this is one of those
triple-threat mini ITX boards it's got
MDOT two color neutral and Wi-Fi all in
one little package that's pretty sweet
switching gears to the arsenal' gaming
series this is for more of the budget
oriented gamer who doesn't want to break
the bank but still wants a nice looking
board and potentially for some
overclocking right here we have the z2
70 tomahawk which kind of has a sort of
a I don't know like an Amazon Amazonian
theme that's a word the heat sinks are
pretty cool actually like them they look
a little bit more contemporary than you
know transformer ish also you get this
really like steel looking steel plated
chipset heatsink I believe the MSI logo
does eliminate RGB and of course you can
disable that if you so choose and
finally in the Arsenal gaming series we
have the
be 250m mortar again no overclocking
done here but this is a micro ATX port
that if you just wanted something simple
that does the job and you got a new
skylake CPU preferably one that is not
unlocked
that would be semi pointless in a board
like this but it does kind of have a
cool aesthetic again going with that
kind of like tank tracks I think they
were saying it looked like the PCB is
supposed to look like a bunch of tank
tracks just rolled over your board
fortunately that's that's not actually
what's what's happened otherwise the
board probably would be too functional
we do have an m2 slot which is pretty
impressive for for a be 250 M bore a be
250 chipset board that is nvme as well
so you do get some high storage or
high-speed storage connectivity for a
board at a relatively low price point
and finally we have our Pro Series this
is more targeted at working
professionals those who are doing
content creation you can also do some
pretty heavy duty gaming with these
boards however they're they're not
exactly tailored for that they have
really high endurance and how very
reliable components that are built in
and there are three options here with
the bottom one here being mini ITX the
other two are ATX if you were curious
about the names we've got the z2 70's
li+
these e27 TPC mate and the mini ITX
board which is the b2 o5i pro alright
guys so I have saved the two
motherboards that I am excited for for
last so here we have two rising boards
these are a m4 socketed motherboards
from MSI of course we've got the X 370 X
power gaming titanium over here and then
the be 350 tomahawk as you can see here
we've got the the new socket type 4 a.m.
4 you are going to need a new cooler
that is compatible with that socket as
old like am3+ coolers and the like FM
tooth it is not going to work with this
new with this new board type so you do
get 1 2 2 2 m dot 2 slots for fast
storage and vme very good nice to see
and you've also got USB 3.1 type C that
is Gen 2 right there on the back of the
motherboard and then you've also got the
onboard onboard connector as well fancy
that look at this little demo setup
whoo this is a z2 70 got a 7700 K in
here I believe pretty sexy on that
titanium board as well
triple rad we're the BIOS right now and
holy smokes 5.2 Giggs yo I ask someone
at MSI how this was done and apparently
it's just a one click of the game boost
feature that they have in the BIOS
automatically took it to 5.2 gigahertz
and that's pretty damn sweet I'm kind of
kind of bummed that my 7700 K only goes
to 4.9 stupid it's not fair
alright guys that is gonna conclude it
