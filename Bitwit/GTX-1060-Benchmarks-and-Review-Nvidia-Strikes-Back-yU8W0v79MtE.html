watching this video on the day of upload
the GTX 1060 from Nvidia has just hit
the market at a starting MSRP of 249
with a $50 premium for the founders
edition unfortunately these prices were
announced this month in an online
statement so we couldn't really gauge
Jensen's body language on stage
assuming NVIDIA has stayed true to their
word on pricing however the GTX 960
successor puts itself in direct
competition with AMD's new rx 480 which
starts at 240 dollars for the 8 gig
reference card and around 30 to 50
dollars more for the custom board
variants when they arrive essentially
both GPU manufacturers are competing for
the hearts of mainstream gamers and
they're both thirstier than a girl
gamers twitch chat so today we'll see
how these cards stack up in terms of
performance and value after we take a
quick look at the green team's new card
the Pascal based GTX 1060 sports the GP
106 GPU with 10 streaming multi
processors in 1280 CUDA cores a base in
boost clock of 1500 and 6 and 1700 and 8
megahertz respectively a memory clock of
4000 and six megahertz with 6 gigs of
gddr5 on a 192 bit bus and a TDP of 120
watts the cooler features a new but
familiar polygonal design with a blower
style fan that moves hot air out the
back of the chassis and
aluminum heatsink that provides 50% more
coverage than the GTX 960 which offers
25% more coverage than Obamacare at the
end of the 10 enshroud is a single six
pin power plug that's placed well past
where the short PCB ends indicating some
fancy soldering work another interesting
move here is the omission of an SLI
finger and SLI support for this card all
together somehow I know Jay is still
gonna find a way to water cool four of
these things but apart from that I agree
with Nvidia that multi-gpu setups should
usually be reserved for only the highest
end cards when there's no faster single
card option available at the back of the
card you'll find the standard assortment
of reference display outputs for Pascal
three DisplayPort 1.4 one HDMI 2.0 B and
a dual link DVI I'm happy to report that
overclocking the gtx 1060 and MSI
Afterburner was an absolute delight
enthusiasts will rejoice that the chip
has more Headroom than a hoe riding
shotgun which allowed me to dial in a
two hundred and thirty megahertz offset
without touching the voltage bobbing the
max core clog to over 2.1 gigahertz
throughout my testing the card never
rose above 82 degrees Celsius on my test
bed using a 5820k at 4400 megahertz a
gigabyte x99 gaining g1 Wi-Fi and 16
gigs of DDR 420 666 on Windows 10 and in
case you're curious here's how the card
sounds
the 1060 was using the 360 8.6 for press
driver to run all games at 1920 by 1080
and 2560 by 1440 I was about to run 4k
benchmarks on this card but that was
before 10 our nyan cat guy told me it'd
be a waste of time here's a look at all
the cards tested today which either come
factory overclocked or have been tweaked
manually by yours truly on a side note
I've dialed back the msi gtx 1070 s
aggressive OC mode - the gaining profile
that end users can expect out of the box
with that said let's get on to why
you're really watching this video in
fire strike extreme the gtx 1060 Nets an
overall score 3.5 percent higher and a
graphics score 5.2 percent higher than
the RX 480
a rather small victory also notice how
far we've come since the gtx 960 with a
71% increase after one generation nice
gains Nvidia most companies like Apple
would have just made the card thinner
GTA 5 gives us a first glimpse of real
world gaining performance with the gtx
1060 yielding 14% more frames than the
RX 480 at full HD and a 26% increase at
1440 the 1060 also barely manages to
best the 970 at both resolutions clearly
the gtx 1070 and 960 are in league's of
their own at opposite ends of the
spectrum
hitman 2016 is the only title where we
saw the RX 4 80 lead across the board
though by a smaller margin of 4 to 5%
here the 970 takes a big back seat and
the gtx 960 is basically writing in the
trunk in Metro last light the tide shift
again in invidious favor at Full HD the
GTX 1060 saw 14% more frames than the RX
480 and 21% higher frame rates at quad
HD finally in Crysis 3 there's a pretty
close standoff between our three
mid-range cards but the 1060 barely
takes the crown at both resolutions from
our testing it definitely seems at the
10 60 outperforms the RX 480 by a wider
margin at quad HD than it does at 1080
this time beating out team red by 20%
when totaling the average frame rates we
find the gtx 1060 to be 25% slower than
its GP 104 broski 8.5 percent faster
than the GTX 970 9.5 percent faster than
the RX 480 and it outright poops on the
chest of our gtx 960 now clearly
compared to the RX 480 the 1060 is the
faster chip overall but Kennedy thrown
the polaris card as the current value
king for our frames per dollar
I use the current lowest pricing that I
could find between Amazon and Newegg
for all of our cards with the exception
of the 1060 which we're basing off of
the official MSRP as we can see here the
RX for 80 remains the best bang for the
buck option with 1.9 frames per dollar
compared to 1.7 FPD with the gtx 1060 if
nvidia hopes to pluck this title from
AMD's hand
we'll have to see a custom gtx 1060
that's just as fast retail for no more
than two hundred and sixty two dollars
to achieve an fpd higher than the RX 480
should this be the case I sincerely hope
it doesn't push the 480 over the edge
every card has its limit after all so in
the end which card is right for you well
if you want to make the most informed
decision I would wait to see what the
custom board pricing looks like from
both GPUs once they hit the shelves but
from what we know now the gtx 1060 is a
very fast card for the price and often
scores notably higher frame rates than
the RX 480
especially at quad-hd as I mentioned
earlier well I didn't have time to test
it this also leads me to believe that
the 1060 would have a bit more longevity
when it comes to VR if you got that baby
daddy money the gtx 1060 gets my full
recommendation that being said i
wouldn't call the 1060 an Rx for 80
killer
AMD's new card is still a compelling
choice for 1080 gaming and entry-level
VR whose value may still have some
greater appeal for those on slimmer
budgets but that's gonna do it for now
guys to let me know what you think of
this card in the comments and don't
forget to toss me a like on this video
