hello welcome welcome back this is
awesome hardware a tech news show that
Paul and I do every single Tuesday at
5:30 p.m. we like to start our show off
with a whimpering dog in the background
he's just guarding he's guarding the
house which is a warning limper warns
you that there will be adult language
potentially I mean our screen that's
that's what the dog whimper is
functional everything on the show that
happens is boil and I mean so be warned
of that we also like to have a few
drinks on the show they do it definitely
sounded like it was gonna be bad being
perfectly fine so cheers Cheers
drinking out there and joining us thanks
for being here thanks everybody oh yes
don't be alarmed this is a supposed to
do a hard poor heart morose super hard
it's very jarring at first but give me
hard let your hair report it works out
so that's doing all right so that code
looks like it looks like everything's
functional so cool good looks like we're
online stuff everything sounds and looks
good other than our faces so cool all
right well we also have stores that we
that we like to push on to you guys and
force you to buy things we all sell we
both sell really good things all the
products on here are top-notch quality
it's all very suggestive I would say
that these very suggest about the
margins so we don't make huge margins on
these products they're fairly good what
I'm saying is they're fairly good prices
for what they are yeah so feel free to
check it out for your money we're done
but where should they go Kyle if they
should go to my store which is big with
tech that's good Tech and Paul's is
Paul's hardware halls hardware net both
very easy URLs to remember and if you
happen to pick up anything from either
of our stores we will yell Johnson at
you in a very sexual way I mean will
most likely offend someone
we are restocking the energy be
everything shirts yes that's a request
for that yep yep yeah if you buy awesome
hardware merch from either of our
stories
we share the profits between us we do
and we have like this party where we put
all the money together and we like dance
around that part's not true but I never
agreed to that
what's next kind of doing that so I
think we can just divert it into some
tech news we should do that ah yeah my
half is gonna start with news so let's
start with this article from WCC of tech
shut up phone sorry
phone's going crazy I have to be kind of
uncalled for so many stuff all right
WCC F check so uh AMD Zen 2 samples have
emerged well I shouldn't say they have
emerge this is a safe a true big rumor
it is a fat rumor it is preface that you
should take capital letter the grain of
salt like like all rumors and it's some
easy see of tech so who knows it's extra
rumery because of that fusions their
filthy lies the only thing filthy lies
these guys they're all terrible no
they're great they do great work over
there at WCC F Tech and we appreciate
their articles so this one talks about
someone I think a forum member from hard
OCP who was was basically known for
having juicy rumors and leaks in the
industry so doesn't give him any more
credibility just means that he's he's
leaked a bunch of stuff in the past
account it does give him more
credibility that you say he has been
known to have positive like that implies
credibility I don't know though
it didn't necessarily specify that his
leaks and an info was legit or that it
was accurate but rather that he seems to
be a source of leaks in general thanks
for being clear that absolutely that
this is a forum post forum posting that
it's talked about there's a forum post
just some dude on the Internet
so apparently there's a AMD's and two
samples that have already been handed
over to the RTG Radeon Technology Group
they've already received a sample why so
early
well apparently there may be a change
with the interconnects between the CPU
these n 2 CPU and AMD graphics cards so
RTG needs the sample early so that they
can sort of rework and optimize their
video drivers to play nicely with the
CPU you can cross
fire yours into CPU with an AMD Radeon
Vega 7 nanometre graphics card Cal is
that what you're saying right now yes
you need an you did an a/v link bridge
they need to come up with an advanced
name for crossfire than a V link maybe
link okay link maybe link a be link that
AV fire maybe fire there you go
so I don't know that there's there's
some other speculation here that this is
going to be third gen res and mainstream
chip that we're seeing here on the Sun
to Architecture with a seven nanometer
node so we've gone down from we've come
from first generation which was 14
nanometer and then Zen plus was slight
shrink to 12 nanometer and then we have
seven animator with this third
generation it's gonna be an 8 core 16
thread part that was come on a little
disappointed that we weren't seeing like
a higher core count I know that's kind
we're kind of getting greedy now know
that there's this core war between AMD
and Intel and every generation just
seems to step up well they'll kind of
feel like Andy has let Intel catch back
up now that you tell is you know
supposedly gonna be long unique for 9900
K soon yeah I know and you know what's
the deal AMD Intel always have the
higher IPC instructions per clock but at
least AMD always had that core that core
leverage thread leverage over Intel
until now now it's kind of an even
playing field or even more slanted to
Intel's favor because they have the
higher eight IPC still but also the same
number of course and threads potentially
as AMD I think you know pricing could
could definitely affect that though so
anyway ain't core 16 threads we had some
higher turbos see the years did a weird
thing to 4 4 gigahertz base 4.5
gigahertz boost we don't know what
motherboard the the CPU was tested on
apparently was it was tested it was it
was on the bench and stuff so it could
be a new platform it could be a
completely new chipset and socket or I
would think it's the same socket but
maybe a different chip set because AMD
has mentioned many times in the past I
think you can someone can some really
awesome dedicated fan
scrub through every single awesome
hardware that we've ever done and just
make a compilation of paul emptying out
the last couple drops what I guarantee
you it'll be like 10 minutes long cuz
you know I've seen me before I like
watching the strings back you'll sit
there like a good 10 15 seconds make
sure that I'm say you're very thorough
I'm sitting here listening to you talk
about some stupid thing what better
potentially do flagship CPU from the one
of the largest CPU manufacture right now
I'm excited about this you know there's
only one of two so I would expect
hopefully maybe it would run at a higher
frequency and then these end it seems
like it stuff that we have turbos 24.5
turbos which makes me think that you'd
be able to overclock on all course to
maybe four point seven four point eight
if you're lucky that'd be kind of
claiming if you know if you know
anything about every are doing and check
keep like disappearing so I don't know I
think I think we're still gonna be able
to see some backwards compatibility a.m.
he's been really good with that that was
how they designed aim for and that was
their that's always been their plan with
a m4 was to make it future-proof so that
people with older generation CPUs could
slot them into newer boards and vice
versa they were really good about that
with horizon 2 I would imagine or I
should say second generation I would
imagine they're gonna be similarly
attacking the third gen mainstream rice
and chips in the same way so um let's
see what else what else can we get here
from this huge rumor the forum the forum
member said that the CPU proves to be
great in performance compared to an 8700
2k but that's a very vague statement we
don't know exactly how it's being
compared if that's like single core or
multi-threaded performance in what games
is that is that even a game is that a
synthetic tester like there's it's very
vague could be anything and it's at the
other day it could be all fake too
so um we don't really have much to go on
here rumors are also suggesting to 10 to
15 percent bump in IPC over the current
12 nanometers and Zen + architecture Zen
plus was a three percent about a three
percent performance boost
/ first generations n just Zen non plus
and so now we're gonna potentially see
10 to 15% over that which makes sense
because this is a whole architecture
change not just a refinement and and
that's actually pretty good 10 to 15%
would get it definitely a bit closer to
Intel and make it more competitive in
that department so I guess we'll just
have to wait and see if all these rumors
end up being true and and we'll keep a
close eye on this and they would
potentially have a little goofy
advantage too if they can actually ship
7 nanometre processors true in in bulk
since Intel still can't really attend
meet ship to 10 nanometer stuff right
what's that's good to hear hopefully the
rumor is true I'm excited I like raisin
I want AMD to continue doing good stuff
I don't want it to go like now that
they're know that they made a comeback
to some degree it's like ooh now they
have more to lose and now now I'm like I
get slightly nervous that Intel is just
gonna eventually pass them up again and
we're gonna be back to square one I
don't think we will go back to square
one like before the risin days like pre
risin era but raisins I'm sorry Intel's
got a lot of got a lot of money they've
got a lot of they got a lot of cash flow
they got a lot of resources and AMD has
the burden of attacking both the CPU and
the GPU market getting hit sort of on
both sides by Intel and NVIDIA so
they're kind of spread pretty thick but
I'm hoping for the best I always root
for the underdog usually unless I'm like
betting money on the winning dog then I
I bet
I hope the over dog wins but I'm not
betting on either of them I I own stocks
on both of them
I usually bet on the over cat ah the
lateral move it's never a bad choice the
internet degrees all right so next up
we've got an article here from variety I
never go to variety I only went I just
picked this article because it was
between this and polygon I just felt
sometimes you get them maybe this
polygon and kotaku and I just don't
worry-you is the most kind of mix things
up get some Oh
this table over here so this is it's
bolted I know you anticipated my moves
properly so this is about fantasy author
and aundre's spouse cousin Sapkowski oh
he's from Poland that's that explains
that he's the author of The Witcher
fantasies of Kowski Kowski under it so
this guy is like the mind behind the the
fantasy narrative of The Witcher
franchise that's a pretty cool that is
no that is the Seth Meyers he's a
late-night talk show host folks Paul do
not pay attention to the ads so this guy
when when The Witcher was first be first
Witcher game
CD Projekt RED which is the developer
went up to Andres and we love your work
bro we'd love to give you some royalties
pay you out royalties based on the
profits that we make off his game if we
can own the copyright you know all the
copyright stuff to your work I love
antes and he and this author said no and
I quote he said they offered me a
percentage of their products I said no
there will be no profit at all give me
all my money right now the whole amount
it was stupid I was stupid enough to
leave everything in their hands because
I did not believe in their success but
who could foresee their success I
couldn't so that was a direct quote from
the author basically admitting at least
he admits it I was dumb to think and to
not believe in in their success and to
not think that this was gonna be the
massive success that it was
and he's right how could you predict
that it's kind of kind of hard to
project so any games gonna take off and
what's that you never know when a game
is given to never know you never know um
so but now he's a little salty actually
he's very salty to the point where he's
seeing all the all the cash fall all the
money that the developers are raking in
from a game that was based a game
franchises whole franchise that was
based off of his fantasy lore you know
so he's hired a team of lawyers I
suppose and they're gonna there
they might take this to court they're
demanding 6% of the franchise's profits
do you want six percent of the
franchise's profits is for The Witcher
franchise substantial about sixteen
million dollars oh it's in the headline
or sixty million polish Schlotzsky's I
don't know that's not the right it's
nothing right currency it all for polish
but it's letting in in Europe it's it's
usually either the Euro or whatever the
native language word for crown
Crona yeah Corona Corona 16 million
Corona for Karuna with line yeah no it
stretch to the seats like as lots of
whatever I'm not gonna try pronouncing
it so anyway that's a lot of money
sixteen million um I didn't really get I
think I read it's on this article and
the different article I you ready to
cross verify some stuff I think I read
that the amount he got paid the Athene
that he agreed to his one lump sum was
less than ten grand
oh damn he got paid less than like
$9,500 this would be quite an upgrade
quite an upgrade yep the benchmark Greta
fun that would be substantial so if I
know how lawyers work they're probably
aiming high and then they're hoping to
land somewhere and arbitrate this too
short to get him something in between
which human thousand and sixteen million
dollars which even so you know halfway
between that midway point wouldn't be
bad so I don't know I feel like this is
a very polarizing thing some people are
gonna side with the developers some
people are gonna side with the author
I guess the grounds that the the
developer that I'm sorry the author's
lawyers were saying is that apparently
the contract was only written for the
first Witcher game and it did not
include all the following titles and all
the DLC that came afterwards so this
author is entitled to the royalties on
all those so but you know who's to say
we don't have the con we don't have all
the contracts and the fine print in
front of us so we can't really say but
it is it is quite quite a stirrup say
the least
stirrup this is so this is a moral the
story here is believe in your devs get
back in the saddle if you're gonna
you never underestimate the the power of
viral this where your traps where your
yeah that's it
cuz I'll hide because they don't he
doesn't wear chaps in The Witcher
because I think then the first scene the
cinematic scene you see Gerald's pass
that's just riffing you said stirrups
like randomly for no reason oh oh yeah
sorry and I'm just thinking about video
game characters asked for some reason um
alright anyway
let's let's move on before before we
dive in good idea ass a little more
that's next next we have another article
in WCC of tech this is about Amazon
raising their minimum wage to 15 bucks
an hour a funny picture if we go as
employees I feel like all pictures of
Jeff Bezos are funny
it's like he's shocked but slightly
intrigued it's like somebody that's
probably what seems like it matches what
he's me what he's looking at that made
him make that face my penis someone meme
that image immediately okay so this goes
into effect November first 15 bucks an
hour boys at work at Amazon this will
affect all 250,000 full-time and
part-time employees as well as seasoned
employees which is 100 we have about a
hundred thousand seasonal employees
every year so that's 350 foul people who
will be making at least fifteen bucks an
hour that's a pretty substantial we'll
have to wait for the queue for reports
to see how this is gonna actually impact
Amazon as a business with their stocks
and all that sort of thing how it's
gonna impact investors because that's
crazy
um Sencha lee these people are gonna be
doing the same amount of work creating
the same amount of an outside but
they're gonna be making some employees
will be making substantially more than
they ever have been so it'll be
interesting to see how that impacts
Amazon as a company and their investors
and how Amazon would plan to sort of
counteract the
that effect right are they going to
charge more for shipping to non-prime
customers or are they gonna have to
raise the rates on some of their
products I don't know well Jeff the wait
and see for the q4 reports but it is
quite interesting and maybe I mentioned
Jeff is probably gonna have to put off
some of his cybernetic upgrades yes yes
as a nog as an Augmented human being
there's potentially true what was like a
Amazon fire stick come out of his finger
something like Inspector Gadget that's
classified what if he only starts
speaking in Alexa voice like Alexa does
all the talking for him like he just
replaces his his vocal cords with like
an Amazon echo it's probably something
that like a brain mesh that like can
connects him to the Amazon customer
database he knows what everyone's buying
at any given moment so he can make
analyze trends and stuff like that and
also the direct connection to Alexa be a
really weird superpower to have I'm sure
Marvel and Disney will pick it up and
eventually all right so I don't know and
this suspiciously comes right after
senator bernie sanders proposed his
Bezos Act Bezos Act which basically says
that Amazon workers are relying too much
on government subsidies to survive and
and the Act basically gives profitable
profitable employers like Amazon a
choice of either paying their workers a
fair wage or they can pay for the public
assistance programs that their low-wage
employees are forced to depend upon
because they don't pay them enough so
right after that very shortly after that
Amazon does this whole 15 hour and also
there was another article maybe a week
or two ago about Jeff Bezos dumping in
like a billion dollars or something like
that two billion dollars into the listen
not not not not until I could not in a
literal sense but rather to like I was
like two homeless homeless something for
homeless people dumped a billion dollars
unto homeless people I wonder what that
would what that would do this do you
think they just be like so stunned that
I pick it up I'm not familiar with this
story
you're referencing some really intrigued
it with yeah he used to billion of I
think his own money I'm not sure I think
he's having a real he's he's going
through some crazy guilt trip right now
after the Bernie Sanders thing okay I
think he's he's having some serious
guilt on his shoulders I mean which is
not surprising he's been deemed the
richest human being in all of human
history today pass the absolute yeah I
think he passed uh Bill Gates
Bill Gates by by far yeah okay he's
worth more than Bill Gates in like Elon
Musk and who's the other one maybe
Zuckerberg combined or some summaries
Goodman s is a monopoly guy not bully
guy he's got lots of money
the giraffe from Toys R Us all of his
Jeffery bucks I mean this guy and Jeff
Jeff Jeff versus Jeff Jeff Raph Matt uh
no I'm trying to say this guy is having
a panic attack and probably wondering
like probably thinking that the whole
world hates them for being the richest
dude alive so some good things are
happening because of this every
employees gonna be making at least
fifteen bucks an hour or more that's
what at least means so this could affect
the q4 quarterly results we don't know
and it seems that the Amazon so far has
been greeted with a lot of positive
feedback from this move people are are
praising Amazon at the moment for all
the progressive decisions that they're
making recently I felt positively about
this when I when I heard about it this
morning you know I I mean it doesn't
forgive Amazon for some for a lot of the
other stuff that they've done so it's
not like it's absolute but it's good
that they did it before the holiday
season they could have waited until
after they're currently hiring on for
the busy season seasonal workers and
stuff like that and I believe this does
extend to temp workers and stuff as well
from from whatever yeah so that's that's
that's all good for people who might be
struggling to get by for anyone who's
like international are not familiar with
how minimum wage works in the US it's
usually regional so depending on the
state so some people this might affect
more than others depending on what the
current state minimum wage might be but
I was reading some responses from people
like I'm currently making 12 or
something and this bumps me up to 15
that's a decent jump for a lot of people
family especially if you're you know
struggling to get by you know raising a
family or something and hopefully this
would follow the whole theory that the
more people get paid the better a job
that they do or they feel like they're
happier with their job and so they they
put a little bit more effort into it
that doesn't always apply but maybe in a
broader sense we can see some some good
morale a good morale boost with within
the company which is always good trend
that trickles down to the customers at
the end of day so let's move on to a not
so happy story about another tech giant
Facebook Facebook getting hacked like a
mofo like a BAM like a bitch
Facebook was hacked recently 50 million
user accounts were compromised
40 million perhaps more this has been
the biggest breach the social media
giant has ever experienced in their
history of existence 3 bugs were
allegedly used in the breach the
attackers stole user access tokens which
basically tell the site verifies your
identity and tells the site what that
user has access to what information
pride that includes like DMS like
private messages all that shit can be
had with an access token this also
affects any site that uses facebook
login so Instagram a bunch of news sites
in Girt MJ imagery I don't know if
imagery uses facebook login but there's
a ton of sites that use faces a lot of
face it those are all affected don't use
your Google account to log into stuff
don't use create and dedicated doing
this stuff
make separate password use a password
manager yes your browser's password
manager yes and and the reason is is
because these these huge huge tech
companies Google Facebook etc they
tended they do tend to have better
security on average than like a million
little sites do but the trade-off there
is that when those sites get breached
it's a mass
it's a millions of users are affected to
message it's a mass effect good
reference it's a shit show it's a total
shit show so that's the trade-off there
and and if you guys are curious at all
as to how the hackers may have pulled
this off just a very high-level idea
here there was some specialist in the
article that was like I know things and
this is probably how they did it so
essentially to get those access tokens
the hackers were exploiting the site's
view as feature I don't never used this
but the view as feature basically allows
you to view your profile through the
eyes of a different user so if you
wanted to suffer example if you blocked
your dad the example that they gave is
if you blocked your dad on Facebook from
seeing your photos you just said you
know you because you can do those
permissions dad cannot see my photos you
check photos you can do the view as
feature to see what your profile would
look like from your dad's perspective so
the hackers apparently exploited that
feature on Facebook to see what -
basically view and change alter anything
on someone's profile so for example if a
user via view as impersonated a friend
of theirs who themselves had another
friend who had a birthday the feature
would would also show a box prompting
them to post like a happy birthday video
and then that video apparently would
create would both generate and send the
the attacker a user token or an access
token for that particular user and then
they from there they'd be able to use
that access token to access and modify
and just basically yeah basically just
you would have all access to all their
data and if they can create an algorithm
that just does that same behavior on a
massive scale you can see how they could
easily affect compromised 50 million
accounts within very little time so it's
it's a little bit scary to think that a
website as big as Facebook with so many
users can be hacked I don't want to say
hacks so easily but that it can
definitely be hacked
you know experts are saying that this
required a lot of technical skill to
pull off but you know hackers usually
work in groups and so when you have when
you're pulling that many minds together
on on a single thing on cracking a
single barrier there's obviously there's
a much higher chance of them getting
through and so yeah you know no one no
one is truly safe at the end of the day
we're all susceptible to these breaches
so I think if your instructions are
pretty clear for the most part but that
am I able to apply this view ass picture
there's selection to any of my friends
yes to any of your friends okay to
anyone who follows you
you can just do you ask view ass that's
just right there yep if you as a s not
two S's that would be a definite breach
of privacy and a serious concern that
Facebook probably I want to concern
themselves with I was thinking about
kind of Facebook but I guess never mind
no that wouldn't you want to check out
ass book for that that's said you're on
the wrong side of the internet ass book
comm trust me but enough about that
let's let's move on to maybe another I'm
just gonna go through a raw emotional
roller coaster right now guys and take
you on it because those next articles
pretty cool buckle up buckle up bitches
asus rog
doubling down on dram double d rama to
sport double capacity BB ram gen its
Triple D ringing now double capacity
dims I'm rocking some D ddr4 modules DDR
so this is one overclocked 3d apparently
for their next-gen motherboards I would
assume Z 390 for example asus rog there
ROG division is planning to support
double capacity technology the picture
they're showing says LG a one one five
one so yes yes 390 yep there you go so
this is sort of an idea as a surrender
but it's gonna gives you sort of an idea
of what this double capacity dam will
look like so fast that like makes it
your
- EP you like globe molten hot lava I
mean that's that's where we're headed
fall is is RGB trace layouts that's
pretty sweet
so you can see that the day burger
oh my god no engineer go to voltage but
tell me that wouldn't sell for so hard
ok if every trace play out ok 15 fifteen
thousand people quit at Asus
incorporated issues check has lost half
their workforce so this is this is cool
32 gig modules basically by elongating
the the modules themselves making these
sticks twice as tall so that you can fit
more memory though yes you can see like
all the DRAM chips on there right little
wide the dim saw socket is there's no
way we can fit more in there it's a
maximum width and you know one guy spoke
acoustic what if we go you get a
promotion sir so yeah that's basically
all it is it's sort of a new form factor
but kind of not in a way I feel like
it's gonna still slot into a regular dim
slot but perhaps the trace layouts will
have to be different as Asus was saying
through this article is that they
they're gonna be manufacturing custom
boards that have unique trace layouts to
accommodate and support this new
technology where we stop to wait and see
if other vendors are gonna follow suit
we haven't heard any word from Corsair
or G skilled and so forth to see if
they're gonna hop on board this
bandwagon but I would imagine that some
of them have to this is the heck is this
zenyk is one of the first they're one of
the first manufacturers to have
developed double capacity dims so asus
wouldn't be the first in the market with
this technology this has already been
done I should have started off with that
but ACS is definitely you know sort of
the bigger brand within the PC DIY
gaming
market so yeah this isn't gonna really
appeal to many people only the the most
hardcore of workstation users you know
professionals and stuff who need to
leverage 64 gigs plus of ddr4 memory but
there you have it there you have it
we'll see if other board manufacturers
offer this as well
well we've typically seen as ACS is
definitely a huge innovator in the game
and will come to market with a new
technology or some sort of new standard
and then slowly other manufacturers will
kind of follow suit and stuff we've seen
that time and time again this could be
another one of those we'll see
and then finally last article here in
the news segment we have a battle we
have a showdown of sorts it's the Battle
of the bridges what a battle battle of
the NV link bridges Paul okay because
this is also from overclock we're asking
people this question first ruffle yes
the straw poll which we're gonna drop at
a chat right now nobody vote yet you
haven't seen these yeah
maybe don't give it to the minnows that
one and then there's this one three you
guys get to vote all right enemy link
bridge is the best correct and of course
you didn't give them the option for the
the og and video like the standard and
video one should I
I don't know well that was not RGB
though no one's gonna pick that it's
battle of the Adhan board partner RGB
envy link bridges okay which is a little
long but I'm sticking to it
alright so our three options are the
asus rog bridge there it is there it is
three blocks some fresh metal you can
see the leads come anigh angles and i
want to point this at you because they
actually show i actually have seen this
bridge in person although they wouldn't
let me steal it from them it they put
they put brush metal and an RG logo on
the back of the bridge that you will
never see this on the back it's just
that it's attention to detail so if it's
the finished completed finished project
I guess I guess the back makes sense for
like articles like this yeah when you're
taking a picture of the back of its the
box is all Dale
using this r-tx anyway next we have the
gigabyte gigabyte Horace looks like they
got a three slot in the fourth slot
version it's good but yeah I mean it's a
little simple it's very simple that
simple I mean there's this texture part
it is it's different that the three slot
in the four slot version there's this
extra textured piece and yes I think up
to room you know might as well throw
some sexiness in there so something just
disconnect from your computer oh rip
camera hold on
what Wow dad I can fix it were you not
plugged in the power I think it's still
here slow right yeah they should be able
still here there we go okay okay that's
what happened before there's something
with the rips I don't know everyone
swell just I get it the rip saw just
ripped yeah rip okay all right I think
we're back on track now yeah so the
horse bridge looks pretty good it's hard
to see where the RGB elements are I
would think within the Auris lettering
and then the sort of yeah it's not lit
up there's definitely more it looks like
there's more RGB on the right than the
left because the right side has a little
on the left see it there's got the
little slots here slits on the top top
left that yeah
that's not there on the three slot range
is that light up oh I don't think that
lights up mainly that's just shiny
plastic it looks like it's like a semi
opaque opaque type of plastic oh it's
not really it's yeah I think what's
gonna light up is your is your edge of
the Auris okay oh and then the Auris
logo in the middle could be totally
wrong but that one doesn't have it the
three slot doesn't have that little
accent so yeah there are definitely some
physical changes it's jarring jarring
the very sharp very charged EVGA going
with the sort of okay does EVGA have
some sort of fascination with bees cuz I
always get like sirs-e hives out you
feel a beehive vibe from them do you
remember the ten series cards
how there was very hunt they were very
high yeah design okay and now I'm
getting sort of again like sort of like
a like an insect pod I don't know why
maybe it's just me slightly like it's so
it's still got angles and stuff it looks
very ease a little bit more rounded at
the edges I know I'm not saying I don't
like it and since it's very it's very
specific very stylized look and I think
in the right build it would look great
I like they've included a couple
pictures showing what lights up in the
different colors that's that's nice I
think it definitely has the most surface
area of a lumen ated surface area out of
the three bridges that we've seen as
cure so if you're just a bling whore
then this is the bridge for you again
EVGA EVGA Horus Horus and asus those are
our options
yeah we haven't give me yet giving you
guys too much time to respond but we're
still gonna look at the results take a
look Zeus in the leaves is winning by
quite a by quite a large margin have to
wonder if that's because that's who we
talked about first and people were just
immediately struck by it or are people
just me people just like in better now I
honestly like the Asus one out of the
bunch the mostly as well both still
coming in Cal is this is this linked in
your video description nope nevermind
alright we're gonna revisit it so it's
just a it's just a song live this is
live baby so thanks to be 250 issue
voted yep thank you guys and it's just
good job on your winning design yeah and
good job on the runner-ups alright
before we move on to the second segment
we have a spawn we have a sponsor for
today's show - Toshiba and basically
Toshiba wanted us to show you guys these
SSDs that they have booth there in a few
different varieties and I believe all of
these are using their BICS flash memory
which seeks which is which is more
affordable so you can get a very
reasonably priced SSDs that are still
quite fast and everything so we have the
Toshiba
X
700 here in the middle which is an
external basically like a 2.5 inch
style SSD it's got USB type-c on it I
believe it's also USB 3.1 gen2 so that's
cool but yeah we're gonna unbox one of
these right now any standards only
choose one
pretty standard say that say the rev
three speeds yeah
what's like so is this external or not
that's external okay okay USB three okay
got it
that's external cool so Andy yeah you
got the Tara 200 which often has really
really good prices I've recommended this
for quite a few different system builds
because just a solid you know standard
SATA SSD yeah this is a 240 gig but I
believe it's also available in 512 and I
think it goes it might go up above that
as well we're gonna quickly unbox this
little one no because it's the most fun
yeah it's a it's the the m-dot to OCZ RC
100 actually never use later no I got it
got it yeah it's a little sticker I mean
I thank you
nope I got it all I could get a knife
yeah independent oh wow
they're very it's a very small bang man
so this is actually what's the length on
this guy it's a 22 point 2 42 42 22 42
so 42 millimeters long definitely a lot
shorter than most standard and about two
drives you've seen I love this this is
gonna be great in like a mini ITX build
I mean yeah nem got to drive is pretty
good for for keeping things nice and
compact
it's a PCIe gen3 by 2 connection nvme
standard so it is the newer standard
you're gonna get a little bit of extra
performance out of that when it comes to
stuff like boot times and everything
yeah but yeah RC 100 available
Medus at fine retailers online and
otherwise so check out these products
find products from Toshiba and a big
THANK YOU to Toshiba for sponsoring
awesome hurt me it's so small that it
could just magically disappear into my
pocket didn't follow me home
well we do need to bring them to your
place next week so and we might might
just do that
there you go all right all right thanks
for Sheba yeah all right let's move on
from sponsor spot to pip not PC we're
doing the Mini ITX edition yo Mini ITX
dish we need to add the sponsor link to
the video's description
oh yes coming soon
yes you can oh you didn't you already
did yours no all right all right so
let's let's do the Mini ITX pin my PC
we're going small form-factor today
because we got to show the SFF crew some
love we usually you know ATX and ATX
usually hogs the show so I figured it
was time that we do around some smaller
bills
so this first ones from dr. Luke G also
mini mini and micro Girl mini what
they're all many many nevermind almani
he said he gave us a PC part pick or
list so it looks like he's have a core
i5 8400 in here with a crier ring c7
great little low profile cooler and
asrock be 360m Mini ITX of course AC
Mini ITX motherboard g.skill ripjaws 5
16 gigs to buy a king sticks a 250 gig
850 Evo and looks like I've got a gtx
1066 gigabyte card super clock from EVGA
inside of the cooler master elite 130
mini ITX tower case and let's take a
look at this system here I really like
this case I've never built in it
personally but it's always been sort of
in the back of my mind as consideration
for a small cube case this thing is
basically just a frame it's like a
shoebox sized case that just has some
mounting points on it for a motherboard
power supply and and it's really really
compact but you've chosen parts wisely
in here it seems to make it look pretty
cavernous like well cuz it's
everything's very very bunched up so
like his motherboard
he's even got an additional cooling fan
pumping in some air from the side which
which I appreciate there yeah and then
the power supply is just right on top of
it and all the cables are you know
there's not a lot of place to put them
it's hidden
here but they're all tied up pretty well
yeah so with those out of the way
there's just there's a lot of empty
space right up here in the front which
is great I mean it's rare that you have
a case this small and have that much
empty space where you've got like 50%
just room for activities or air aka
airflow he asked us what he should do
with it like I'm not exactly sure what
you could throw in there apart from like
you had an 80 400 so you're not
overclocking I mean I would say like you
know if you had an overclockable CPU
maybe an all-in-one or something that
you could run the tubes over there
please have more 80/60 motherboard -
yeah so you're not overclocking so I
mean we'll use storage storage basically
this is what you have as a possible
expansion there you can add more you can
maybe makeshift a 3.5 inch cage to add
some more hard drives or maybe do a
little SSD array in there for for some
super fast storage or something I'm not
I wonder can you forget if you can mount
a 120 read at the front of the case
where that fan is good you could
definitely swap out the motherboard and
CPU for something overclockable and and
keep it cool yeah that would fill it out
a little bit more I'm not either way I
mean you can still upgrade your your
graphics card yeah that would take up a
little bit more space table almost
basically what you have you've allotted
yourself more space for something like
that
honestly from an aesthetic point of view
though all you could really do here is
maybe get custom cables that are better
cut to length cables that are just
perfectly perfect length you have to
measure it out and get them
professionally done or do it yourself
god help you and I think that would that
would make it look really nice super
clean but again it's something that you
would only like you yourself would just
take pride in it because no one else
would really be able to see it in this
case there's a window yeah unless you
wanted to make your own window I mean
knock yourself out if you're open to
that sort of thing
but it looks it looks fantastic yeah
very well done yeah thank you sir thank
you doctor let's move on to Maui Wowi I
think that's how you parent me he's a
little bit late a core i3 8100 once
again we have a
8000 series processor from Intel with a
bit quiet shadow rock slim
that's great cooler 8 gigs HyperX fury
ddr4 2666 MSI GTX 1060 we have once
again a GTX 1060 however this one's a
three Kingdom bike cart we have a 250
gig Samsung Evo 960 and/or a 960 Evo and
gigabyte Z 370 and so you're gonna see
370 motherboard in there but not an
overclockable CPU 400 watt be quiet
straight power 10 and this is all inside
of the Nano s from fractal design one of
my favorite mini ITX cases for its time
so this is a very clean build ya cable
management is like very clean very well
done I like it I have not seen this
before taking the peg connector from the
graphics card yeah passing it through
the two front intake fans I like that I
haven't seen it before I like it yeah I
mean thought I think if it was longer
and you could hide it from the the
reservoir the reservoir wall got across
here in the back yeah or maybe like
position it so that it's right behind
them the graphics card so if you're
looking at it dead-on it's kind of hard
to see thank you
down there and then across right I'm not
sure if that would work but um but but
it's very clever what you have I mean
it's going pretty straight across there
so it's not it's not too bad pretty
clever and yeah cable management is just
super on point ah
and you've got it look different here
maybe it's an older picture right it's
probably messed with it here it goes
down yeah it's kind of more traditional
here it goes across in between I think
on the bottom one he looks like he went
down and maybe he routed it underneath
the front fan cuz it looks like it's
still down and around and coming from
there either way it looks great ok umm
actually like that way a little bit
better once the side panels on and stuff
and then I mean custom cables really cuz
everything's so clean already that I
think a custom set of sleeved cables
would would do you some good
yeah so definitely this
it's not as visible and with the side
panel because it's being blasted out by
the LEDs but um I think removing your
power supply sticker it's a lot of small
text on there that probably isn't
looking the greatest and I'm very much
like a fan of like balancing colors so
if you just have like one red element in
your case like your graphics card I
usually like to add some red elsewhere
in the system just to sort of tie
everything together so it doesn't stand
out so much but more more so looks
intentional so maybe you know I don't
know I'm sure I mean the HyperX kit that
you have in there is perfectly fine for
your memory but if you wanted to get
some red ones they if they also have
them in red with red heat spreaders be
kind of cool if one of the one of them
was red and one was black that would
look good
that would totally look good maybe a
black and red fan for your cooler black
and red fans for your existing case fans
if you want to spray it and do some
spray-paint action but that's all just
personal taste it's very subjective it's
all aesthetic and overall this is a
really clean system I agree I don't know
why I picked it it's perfect yep thank
you very much Travie next up we have
mei-ling mei-ling mainly sorry amazing
that's the only way that you can
pronounce that name
meline t to be exact as rock fatality a
be 350 horizon 520 400 G 128 gig m2 SSD
one terabyte mechanical rage and tech
Metis meanness Medus me just I don't
know how to pronounce that made his +
Metis Menace plus with a corsair CX m
550 watt 80 plus bronze and xpg spectryx
and believe that's the memory nice
photos and 16 gigs ddr4 give my GTX 1060
s10 GTX 1060 s must be the that's the
car that you go if you have a mini super
small form-factor maniacs
oh yeah when they can make them this
small yeah yeah definitely I think you
can make it 1070 the gigabyte makes 1070
with that exact same cooler on it too
super fast though so this is actually
really nice system
I wanted to say real quick there was a
mailing I used to work on the egg expert
myhnegon expert was the forums on new
egg and there was a mailing who was a
very frequent contributor there I wonder
if this is the same mailing but maybe
anyway I try these names so you know
yeah yeah so very nice pictures I'm only
5 billion people who have their names ok
very compact build this is probably the
least flattering picture but it also
shows us a lot of what's going on inside
there coz right there's a lot of cables
and you know there's not a lot of space
of room to work with here so how's this
your first shot looks so clean except it
does it's like wow what did you do with
all your cables yeah and let the side
panel off there so it's also interesting
to see that this case Orient's the GPU
on the top yeah where it's like
horizontal it's because I was trying to
figure out how it was all oriented from
this from the the GPU picture that you
had yeah I was like wait what that
doesn't make sense but yeah I see I see
now how how how this case works oh I
think that again with the really small
form-factor build like this custom
sleeve cables that are cut to size go a
long way and as far as like you know you
actually have a case here a mini ITX
case that's this small that has a window
it's very pretty rare how many cases
this size do so it kind of matters a
little bit more I guess if you care
about that sort of thing this is PIP my
PC after all what the inside looks like
at least on the CPU side CPU side of
things which is great you've got some
RGB here you've got you know your your
AMD raid spire perhaps I think that
might be a spire cooler or yeah along
with that RGB memory and it looks really
nice the cable management again with
custom slave cables that that would be
fixed up it looks a little bit like that
you can tell there's like a lot of
excess cabling here that doesn't really
have anywhere to go but the case is
smaller than like the cables don't need
to be as long as they are for a case
this size but I will say that with
everything
with the side panel on the cables are
all drawn away to a point where you
can't really see them true command we
see the the good part so true so that's
well then good point and know everything
else looks pretty good ya know maybe use
oh yeah and I see some like just regular
plasticky or just the regular twist ties
swap for zip ties so we need some
high-quality zip ties swapped in for
those you mean tweezers tweezers called
tweezers Paul weave anyone who's watched
the Verge's pc build video knows that
those are called tweezers I stand
corrected
yes you do
alright but everything else looks really
solid loving that video card thank you
very much mr. mailing or mrs. or miss
mailing or none of the above who knows
probably miss probably miss mister
missus mister missus okay moving on to
Martin Martin Martin team
Martine has a core i7 7700 K overclocked
to 4.6 gigahertz finally now we're
getting somewhere
you know we have a really fast high IPC
quad-core hyper threaded core i7 chip in
a mini ITX bill that is overclocked
gigabyte z170 n perfect to 16 gig sticks
of Corsair Vengeance lpx well you've got
32 gigs of ram in here nice with the GTX
1080 so this is a very very high-end
built ah this is this is a monster this
is a little beast so to speak with a
Noctua NH u9s with to knock to it and if
eat a ate fans there will take 200
millimeter front fan in the front inside
of the Thermaltake core V one very
popular mini ATX case a thermaltake core
b1m X 300 one terabyte SSD of course and
a 4 terabyte hard drive in there whoo
power supply is a supernova 715 killing
it with the specs bro the specs are off
the chain and your cable working stuff
looks pretty good there's the
motherboard again
motherboard was I think was MSI oh I'm
sorry gigabyte Gaz 170 M gaming five I
will personally say that I know the
angle at which you had to install your
graphics card angle the graph of the
graphics card if you look especially
like this the side angle shot of it is
probably a really good example of it oh
yeah much long it's longer than the case
itself sure you cannot just drop it in
straight straight down it you have to
get any one sign end of it in and get it
down in there and then get the other one
and then let it settle and like for you
have this moment of panic really this is
this good this is gonna fit like a vine
am I gonna have to shave a corner of it
off or something like that yeah yeah
don't um alright so I managed to make it
fit so she said um all right somehow
turn all of your Noctua fans all black
yeah well I shouldn't really magic we do
that problem solved
replace them with the nock to a chrome
axe fans sure with the black fans
correctly bands are not available in all
different sizes and shapes and these are
what sizes are eighty or ninety to I
think the 92 millimeter is the one on
the CPU and ninety I'm not I'm not
positive it I have to look at this I
think you're right it's definitely
smaller than a 120 yeah they're not one
twenties though yeah yeah that's why I
say use magic use magic to turn these
all black yeah I mean just just magic
magic yeah thank you for getting the
pivot reference check uh so we have a
lot of extra cables down in the basement
I mean and I'm only pointing this out
cuz like it stands out in the picture
from the side I don't know what you can
do with it it's a power supply that has
a lot of cables yeah sleeves yeah more
custom sleeves and yep change those like
like like Paul said do magic oh there
there who said that Chet great Juan and
Chet said there might be Redux versions
of these fans that you could swap out
there you go it might have equivalent
performance that are kind of that great
they're kind of a gray and gray yeah I'm
used those before from the silver build
those are nice again that positive but
that might be a an option I know they
have
80 millimeter for sure yeah but yeah
overall like I think you've done for the
amount of hardware you have in here like
there's other than some caves some
custom cables that are like cut to
length for for the short runs that you
have to make I think you've done
everything you can
yeah the things about us that's a
beastly system in that little $40 case
yeah
40 is like 40 45 bucks exactly little
fans n be six to seven thank you very
much with the risin risin seven
seventeen hundred and Noctua NHL nine
CPU cooler an asus rog Strix be 350 ITX
motherboard 16 gigs of g.skill transy
3200 speed samsung 860 Evo one terabyte
SSD of course there SF 600 and a galaxy
gtx 1070 katana all inside of the dan
casey 4's effects v2 I have seen this
system before MV is shared with me in
the past and I thought it was absolutely
gorge
so I guess you can consider this sort of
a semi submission half submission half
honorable mention I really love how this
system is set up I think it's really
clean your cable management looks a
thousand times cleaner than mine the
work that I did in my recent damn case
build I don't know how you did it it
just looks super clean and you're using
stock cables and everything just looks
insanely good I love I love the memory
and and the CPU fan that cooler is
probably one of those popular to use for
this case because the Z clearance on the
CPU coolers here for this chassis is so
limited yeah
which is also why you went with a risin
7 1700 which is a 65 watt TDP chip I
think that was a really smart move so
I'm sure your thermals are fine
also the GPU I think is a great choice
you went with a blower style cooler
it's a katana it's a blower style cooler
but it's not just like a founders
edition it's not just like a really
nasty like I don't know like so there's
some lousy turbo cooler cards out there
this one looks badass though is the
not a single slot or one-and-a-half slot
I feel like it's narrower than most oh
you might be right could be right yeah
yeah see Steve has hardware hardware I'm
buck steve is a video on it is that then
yeah it's definitely thin maybe even
single slot is it a single slot Wow in
that's pretty badass
sweet sweet okay cool yeah I'm great
choices all around be great yeah I mean
I really there's not much that can be
done to boost the appearance of this rig
other than you know customs leave cables
and maybe getting a more color neutral
fan I mean I know that that's slimming
not to a fan at 19 millimeter fan is
really good for what it is so I swapped
my Knock to NHL nine NHL nine fan for
the 92 millimeter Redux version I have
which is pretty much equivalent
performance maybe even slightly better
than this one slim is what is it's not
slim though it's thicker so you would
lose some of that Z height and I'm not
sure it would fit in here probably not
probably not anything much thicker than
this at all is like no-go it's like this
or the c7 cry rig those like the two air
like high-performing or like sort of
acclaimed critically acclaimed air cores
that will fit anything beyond that like
even add five ten millimeters like no
chance it's a very very limited case in
that sense but there is the the ace of
tech 92 millimeter a IO that you could
drop in there if you wanted to do some
modifications I think it's great yes
