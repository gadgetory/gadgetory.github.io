2015 is brought to you by WD how's it
going everyone Kyle here with
awesomesauce network I am here in Las
Vegas Nevada to cover CES 2015 I just
just give me a minute errand the
gigabyte party last night I mean you
know open bar oh he seems like a good
idea at first and then and then it's not
just give me a minute all right just
give me a minute all right guys I know
this was supposed to be like a really
fancy and formal event coverage type
thing but given the circumstances I
think I'm just gonna walk around the
show floor and stop up whatever booths I
think look cool and and talk about him
and stuff and didn't just hit chill I'm
just going to show all right ready to go
in all right let's go let's go come on
so I'm at the beyerdynamic booth right
now and as many of you know I am a huge
fan of iodine beyerdynamic because I've
got a pair of dt 880 pros that I use
every day at home and i'm absolutely in
love with them but they're actually
pretty low-end compared to some of the
stuff that they have here on display
this for example is their t90 these are
six hundred and fifty dollar headphones
they're open back design microfiber
cloth that uses Tesla technology for the
highest rated efficiency and we're
pretty awesome so I'm gonna put them on
and give them a listen they've got a
tablet here or I can choose what song I
want to listen to I'm feeling dre what
do you think aaron dr. dre and aaron
says yes by the way these are hooked up
to an a 20 beyerdynamic amplifier has
two headphone outputs oh it sounds so
good it's just sounds little good just
I'm just gonna die a jam out for a bit
check it out so behind me are 365 inch
4k curved OLED TVs and they're about oh
I don't know five millimeters thick
maybe maybe half an inch but definitely
a slim as some ultrabooks that I've seen
and at 4k resolution on three of these
panels I think my gtx 970 at home could
probably run one sixth of the pixels
here met the razor booth now so you're
obviously going to expect to see some
gaming peripherals like mechanical
keyboards mousepads mice and things like
that one thing I did not expect to see
here was a virtual reality headset I
kind of threw me off a bit but it's
pretty cool it's open source does 1920 x
1080 the fact that it's open source
means anyone can develop for it and this
is a developer kit that should be
hitting the stores sometime in june
alright guys i'm here at benq now and
they've got a lot of Awesome monitors as
always and this one in particular caught
my eye just because it's so visually
appealing this is a 4k IPS panel the
model number is a bit of a mouthful so
I'm just gonna read it off to you it's
the BL 320 I I think it's I or 1 i'm not
sure ph so that's that's the name of
this monitor right here but 4k and
formula second response time which is
actually fairly good for an IPS panel
aside from that it does have five USB
3.0 ports that you can use as a hub for
your peripherals or flash drive stuff
like that and I believe it also does
have a plethora of video outputs so you
got dual link DVI you've got to hdmi
you've got one display port and one mini
DisplayPort out so all in all a pretty
sweet monitor maybe maybe I can talk to
somebody at benq and possibly get a
review sample alright guys I've made my
way to the in wind booth and I'm here
talking to Andy Andy how you doing hey
good all right let's go see you again
nice to see you too now I know you guys
were getting a lot of attention recently
for your s frame is really popular case
got an Innovation Award for CES but I
saw a new case actually the one right
here which I haven't seen before this is
the S box correct yeah yeah this is a
loose ball actually we use the sfm
concept to put in this new case if you
can see that this case is one-piece
aluminum also but actually we want to be
more for the camera that's why we are
for the S box you can put a 360 water
cooling on top 120 in the rear and 240
in the meters and because most of the
camera for overclocker they with the use
of final quarter sized water park so if
you'll excuse me on the other side okay
their fire and clapping here after you
put a water clock water block you can
remove this to school to add the water
on top the easier for the game of the
avocado system because i love case you
need to go to take out your water bottle
at the water inside this one will be a
lot easier so really a very water
cooling friendly and with the radiator
support definitely seems like you're
straying away from the s frame model
which is kind of more just like an art
piece or a showpiece it's luxurious
where this is very much more functional
yes there was more talking for the coca
and gamma
I think I think this is my favorite
booth at CES oh my god oh how do they
head of it how do they do that that's
that's so good the feet I was just like
it's like it's just someone's actually
