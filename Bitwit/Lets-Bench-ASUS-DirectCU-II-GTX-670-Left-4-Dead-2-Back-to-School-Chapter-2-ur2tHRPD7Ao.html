4 dead 2 back to school this is chapter
2 and this is pretty much near the
beginning it's not quite the beginning
because i accidentally didn't press f9
to record but you're joining me about 3
minutes in to chapter 2 so you haven't
missed much if you miss chapter 1 go
ahead and watch that now put an
annotation somewhere visible if not then
you are good to go just grab a bucket of
popcorn and enjoy the show right now I
am actually benchmarking I've got some
some applications open some GPU and
hardware monitor as well as cpu-z and
I'm basically going to be giving you
guys a brief report at the end of this
showing you what exactly my scores are
max temp max FPS average FPS and all
that good stuff right now i'm using my
asus directcu two gtx 670 and yeah
playing left 4 dead 2 considering the
games three years old this this card is
just going to chew it up like no one's
business but I figure you know I've been
meaning to incorporate some kind of
computer hardware in into my videos and
I feel like this is a great way to do it
because it kind of combines the two
things I love in one in one in one video
and that is a gaming and computer
hardware so I figure I'm gonna just
benchmark all the games that I play and
give you guys the results at the end of
it and yes granted they are you know
single single GPU benchmarks and it's
only going to be like one card at a time
that'll be marking or that'll be testing
but over time I'm going to be creating
playlists so you could have like
borderlands 2 playlist where you see
every single card that I've ever used on
borderlands 2 you can kind of compare
for yourself the different frame rates
and temperatures and that stuff and I
kind of thing likewise you're also going
to be able to organize playlists be a
graphics card so if you if you have a
gtx 660ti and you want to see you know
what your frame rates will be for with
battlefield 2 or about a pill 3 i'm
gonna have that as well so hopefully
it'll turn out well you guys will be
guiding me along the way telling me what
works
what doesn't and I will be sure to
listen to you guys because you guys are
very honest and you know you're talking
about you guys know what you want so I'm
I'm going to be attentive as possible to
your comments and concerns but for now
just just enjoy the left 4 dead 2
gameplay here playing at 1080 right now
and trying to save my homie here not

shape either Delia well yeah so you know
