today I'm going to be doing a quick
unboxing of a Seuss's owner essence STX
it's an audio card it's my personal
audio card actually I just got it for
Christmas my lovely girlfriend gave it
to me and it's been awesome so far so I
want to share that awesomeness with you
guys doing a quick little video of it
and while I do this unboxing I will be
doing it in my boxers this is due to
popular demand one of my earlier videos
got a lot of a lot of hype about me
being in my boxers so I thought I would
kickstart a new series with this video
and that series I'm gonna be calling it
unboxing in boxers its revolutionary so
with that said why don't we get started
with the sound card this right now is
like the king of santa cards on the
market at the time of shooting this
video anyway it's just a beautiful card
it's got extremely impressive driving
strengths and really high signal noise
ratio and a bunch of other stuff that I
probably don't have a good grasp on but
I'm gonna show it to you anyway so let's
get started you can see it comes in a
nice big black box with their golden
crying tiger on it I don't even know if
that tiger has a name but I'm gonna call
it that the golden crying tiger and as
you can see you can open it I'm not even
doing that but just that's just what
happens when you open it oh how did I do
that
Oasis full of surprises so let's quickly
go over some specifications here this
card is using burb round ax DAC that's
digital analog converters it's got
24-bit audio at 192 kilohertz this is a
PCIe card guys so you'll be slotting it
into one of your PCI lanes on your
motherboard it doesn't really matter
which one I have mine like four slots
beneath my GTX 670 and that's just to
keep it away from it far as possible to
give it some more airflow but you can
put it in any slot you want it doesn't
matter if it's 1 X 4 X 8 X 16 X
everything's fair game so it's not from
that it's got 124 decibel signal noise
ratio it can output to 600 ohms guys so
I mean even even if you have really
expensive high-end headphones that are
600 ohms this card is gonna be able to
drive it no problem oh and did I mention
it has a built-in amplifier this is a
see.yes head
phone amp card amp card so it's got a
built-in amp guys so you don't need to
buy an external amplifier for this it
already comes with one built in so but
other impressive numbers there that I'm
not gonna get into let's just get into
the box itself I'll show you guys what's
inside alright guys so let's get down to
business here pull this sucker out good
box so there you can see the first thing
you see is your beautiful sound card in
a nice plastic clamshell case it's got
layers it's like an ogre pop this guy
out right here you can see your
beautiful sound card seriously like one
of the nicest sound cards I've ever seen
I probably haven't seen that many sound
cards but this one blows that the other
ones out of the water by far but yeah
I'll get into this this is the sound
card very cool stuff and accessories
lovely come on
yes sorry I don't I don't have finger
management issues that's fine
so your first accessory we've got a
quarter inch - actually this is a 3.5
inch 26.3 millimeter jack
so eighth inch to quarter inch jack
right there the golden one and this guy
over here I should put it closer huh
there we go this is an adapter for your
s/pdif house on your standard card this
I'll actually convert it to an optical
Toslink out come on Oh guys sorry the
focus is crappy guys these actually came
in two separate bags when I got them I
just lost one of the bags so I just had
to group them together for the sake of
this video here we have another adapter
this is your stereo jacks - 8 inch jack
so basically or I should say eighth inch
- stereo jacks so you can basically plug
in your computer speakers or your
monitors here and then these two stereo
jacks go to the back of your sound card
nifty nifty little accessory we've got a
sticker here it's not probably not the
most flattering sticker I don't know
where you'd want to put that but there
it is
got an installation driver CD you can
throw that away you guys know better go
to the website
like download latest drivers you've got
a QuickStart guide here don't throw this
away this is useful we got two of them
different languages and it features you
know some some pretty graphs and stuff
like that information on what to do what
not to do and basically the fastest way
to set up your sound card and start
using it very useful and here we've got
what looks to be a poster this is a
poster of The Crying Tiger prank tiger
poster right there
we got a second poster it looks like
this poster is white and much more
washed out from the looks of it so
here's a poster featuring the card
itself maybe if you want to put both
posters like side by side no that's a
good idea huh yeah do that do that
listen to me and lastly this is pretty
interesting this is an audio precision
test report it's a little booklet that
has a bunch of graphs and charts with a
bunch of stats science and this is cool
because this is particularly individual
sound card so they actually Asus tested
the sound card that I got that that
exact one and they gave a report I they
gave some some benchmarks if you will so
that's kind of cool it's not just some
cookie cutter copy paste booklet that
they've included with every card this is
this is my card this is my personal card
and it that feels special to me
excuse cares so with that said let's get
on to the card itself shall we
here we go this is a black PCB as you
can see and it's littered with a bunch
of golden Nietzsche Khan caps you can
tell very nice and this black thing here
it's a EMI shield and basically he's
going to protect all of your core
component rate from electromagnetic
interference because the process of
converting digital to analog signal is
very complex and it's very delicate
so you want to make sure that none of
your other component tree in your case
is interfering with that process and
that's kind of what this EMI shield does
aside from that it also provides a
really nice aesthetic to the card
it's a brushed
it's black and you've got the crying
tiger there along with the Asus logo
very nice very nice touch there guys
we've also got a molex connector for pin
molex plug right there so this card is
gonna require some additional power guys
it's gonna need that power to just give
it that extra driving force that it
needs give it that oomph just keep that
in mind you've also got some front panel
character front panel connector right
there that's basically so you can use
your front panel headphone and
microphone jacks it doesn't really give
you any audio performance increase guys
because you really got to use these
ports if you want that but it's just
there for the sake of convenience so you
can still use those front panel
connectors aside from that we've got
your eye out so starting off with these
you got your left and right stereo jacks
alright so you're gonna plug your
high-end monitors or speakers into those
and you've got two quarter inch Jack's
here one for your headphone one line in
and then you get your s/pdif out right
there which as I said before also
doubles as a Toslink out with that
included connector so that's pretty much
anything oh and I forgot to mention that
yes once again is PCI connector it's PCI
card there's your connector right there
alright guys that's gonna do it for this
video once again this has been the zone
our essence STX from Asus the sound card
for audio files and if you guys enjoyed
this video you like this kind of style
if you dig the unboxing and boxer's
series let me know if not you got a sick
of staring at my crotch I'll get the
hint and won't be offended by the way
don't mind that that is false
it's just 35 pounds of litter but I'm
still getting rid of them it's a
temporary solution they're going to the
pound any day any day now all right I
just want to get that out there alright
but thank you all for watching subscribe
if you haven't already and I'll see you
guys in the next video say bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
