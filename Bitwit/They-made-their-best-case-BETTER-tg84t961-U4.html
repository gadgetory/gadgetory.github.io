brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below
alright the day can continue onward
we're back in man gang what's up
you've gotta be kidding me dude wait
seriously yes what why what is this why
is dude thank you so much I appreciate
it
hey let's shake hands through the
picture just shake the picture thank you
so much I will hang this above our
fireplace this is the coolest thing I've
ever seen
cuz it's me because you know I'm awesome
okay so I think it's time we take it to
the max you beat me to the punch line
starting with the ETS t-50 this is a
very nice air cooler with a white and
black option and you can see we've got
addressable RGB very rainbowy
nice pretty sizeable heatsink here
actually looks like we've got about five
heat pipes and this it looks like it's a
dual fan design at first but if you look
it's actually sort of like a little vent
that you can turn to direct airflow in a
particular direction which is kind of
which is kind of cool if you wanted to
aim it you know maybe more closely to a
certain exhaust area of your case a bit
of flexibility there I wonder how
effective that is but kind of an
interesting idea we also have the ETS T
50 X no relation to the men's body spray
but this is sort of a blacked out
stealth cooler which I actually really
like it's very cool and sort of discreet
no RGB whatsoever but that's cool but
that's okay because there's plenty of
RGB over here they have these new square
RGB fans which is really kind of
disorienting at first it looks like
they're actual square fans but that's
really just the RGB design that's going
around the perimeter of the fans if I
stop that you can see it's still a
regular circular fan but kind of a an
interesting take on it
so Dressel RGB of course we have white
and black options 120 s1 40s and even
200 the 200 millimeter one looks the
weirdest I don't know if it's freaking
me out this is kind of what the fans
look like from the sides
these fans are also plug in place so you
don't necessarily need a motherboard
that supports addressable RGB in order
to get it to do this
this kind of fun rainbow design we also
have a backside this is what the
backside of the fans look like they get
a little mirror demoed here so if you
install these let's say at the front of
your case as intakes you're not
completely in the dark from the other
side you can still kind of get a nice
little weird dotted effect so it's
pretty cool we also have the TV RGB this
is a circular fan bit more traditional
addressable RGB of course it does give
you the option however unlike unlike the
square RGB fans to connected directly
via say that to your power supply if you
wanted to take advantage of the fixed
1200 rpm
this is the revolution RGB 80 plus gold
certified power supply it looks like it
is fully modular it's got nice black
flat cables that come included I really
like the RGB effect here you know if you
can actually find a place for your power
supply to be shown off relatively well
this is actually a pretty good
implementation of RGB it's very nice and
even lighting no hotspots whatsoever
kind of has like a frosted Blade look
it's kind of hard to stop the fan blades
to see what it looks like off but there
you go there's also RGB effects on the
side which is going to be a lot more
visible most likely the majority of
cases then then the fan here so actually
looks pretty nice pretty pretty pretty
classy they haven't overdone it with a
bunch of gaudy effects
you also have the Max Revo 1800 watt
this thing is an absolute animal of a
power supply 230 volts which is which
means it's only going to be usable in
the EU for the most part because we're
limited to 220 volts in the US but they
do have a 1600 watt version that's I
believe 220 volts if you are in the good
ol US of A the nice thing about the fan
that's included in the max rebo's that
actually has the switch on the back if
you press it it actually pumps it up to
3000 rpm and you can actually see just
how effective the airflow is and we have
this little windmill here that's behind
the unit and you can see it's actually
pumping out a ton of air I mean I could
use this on a hot day I could use this
right now actually it's fully modular as
well 80 plus gold certified and comes
with a whopping 10 year warranty very
very well engineered I'm sure you guys
remember the animatic sequence right
well now they have a gold Edition
because Gold's awesome so this is
actually a gold foil design and they're
actually be selling limited quantities
of this okay so they won the Japan bcn
award first place three years in a row
for this case so they decided to
celebrate by having Japanese Kanazawa
craftsmen
actually implement this kind of
modification if you're really into gold
if you're if you're a gold member or
something like that this is definitely
the case for you next we have the Flex
crate FC 30 these cases are interesting
they have these sort of modular panels
that light up that you can actually take
out I don't know how to have it pop them
out but you can replace them they're
modular and they actually come with this
one by default this guy right here okay
so this is a bit more standard you know
I don't know how many of my friends who
would be into into this one oh is that
like Wii Fit trainer or something it's a
pretty interesting concept though it's
gonna be really nice for OEMs who want
to actually trick out these chassis x'
to their heart's content and sort of
brand them in their own way we also have
a look at the internal layout here full
ATX support plenty of radiator options I
mean you got a 360 at the front there it
looks like you can also do potentially a
240 or maybe even a 280 yeah you can do
a 280 up here too that's pretty nice
power supply shroud as well as
addressable RGB pretty much completes
the whole package these are gonna be
relatively affordable at the $60 price
range I believe they said so a
definitely more entry level if you want
even more entry-level I think for like
10 bucks less or so you can get one of
these guys the ll3 0 so this is the
Leonids Leonids and the lib lusion
they're really getting funky and
creative with the of the names this year
so there they are they're pretty much
the exact same case just different front
panel designs looks like this one's
getting air flow mostly from the top and
the bottom these are very thin openings
I wouldn't count on much air getting
through that but this one has more of a
direct airflow path right here so I
think whatever fans mounted right here
would be doing the most damage in terms
of intake looks like we've got three
fans at the front there looks like you
can support a three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator and then perhaps my
favorite case of showing off the day is
the saber Rey advance this is building
upon the original saber ray this is
edimax flagship case and for good reason
it's pretty fantastic looking you know
has a really nice aesthetic very
flexible options here you can actually
remove this acrylic plate and replace it
with a mesh one no they actually have a
mesh one up here it comes included with
two mesh plates so you can do mesh on
the top and the front simultaneously if
you wanted to completely include it
there's also a cool little little screen
here obviously my shutter speed messing
things up for you but if you wanted to
get a
look at system Diagnostics and you have
an asus motherboard that has the
supported node you can actually get a
readout right there on your front panel
which is pretty handy USB 3.1 gen2
type-c is under one of these oh there it
is is right there
plenty of USB three nice i/o fan control
blah-dee blah-blah we also have a
tooless removal very easy to remove side
panel just goes out like that very nice
actually comes in and out quickly and
easily that's what she said
we also have the square fans I believe
these come included with the saber a
advance as opposed to the more circular
ones with the original design white this
is just a lot of white stuff all right
I'm not trying to be racist there's a
lot of light okay this is their new
marble shell ms 30 white okay they have
a black one too but this is the white
one very interesting design okay there's
actually quite a bit of airflow between
these gaps but not getting so much here
be very interested to see how this all
performs airflow wise I believe this is
a relatively entry-level case though
about fifty dollars is what they said if
I remember correctly they were really
stepping up with the radiator options
240 or 280 at the top and it looks like
a 360 is capable of fitting at the front
nice power supply shroud got a nice
opening here for your RGB power supply a
couple SSD mounting trays right there on
the shroud as well here's the white
version of the saber a not the advanced
so you are gonna miss out on a couple
features including the coolest removal
side panel there but that still looks
very nice in white indeed we also have a
white version of the Flex crate 3-0 and
this is looks a little bit girly with
this flower panel I don't know maybe
maybe wifey sauce would like it but
maybe not for me but still looks very
nice in white and it goes carries on
through the interior as well they've got
a white power supply shroud and it looks
like the motherboard tray is white as
well which is a good choice you're gonna
make a white case this is my opinion
gonna make a white case make the inside
white - otherwise it's only halfway it's
pretty good water cooling options for
for a case of this price point actually
not too shabby revolution RGB power
supply that we just took a look at
earlier is also available in white I
particularly like white components when
when addressable RGB is involved just
because it's a bit more reflective of
the light I feel like it shows it off
better as opposed to black what you can
kind of mask it but this looks very nice
you can see this is fully modular as
well and a 750 watt unit I believe
they're going to start with 750 watts on
the market and they might scale up or
down
how well these sell we also have a
couple liquid coolers a lick tech to
three hundred and sixty millimeter in
white these are previously only
available in black but now you get an
additional 120 millimeter fan for extra
heat dissipation and cooling this is
their aqua fusion coolers that are also
available in white but these can come in
a 120 or 240 millimeter variant for your
radiator I particularly like the water
blocks here the LED implementation here
looks very cool very unique doesn't look
overly done and looks fairly high
quality good job better max this is one
of their brand new cases here the icy
gems IG 5-0 this is actually a very
unique design it has two 200 millimeter
fans they're addressable RGB right at
the front of the case you can see we
have ventilation that goes around the
perimeter of the front panel I'd be
interested to test that out looks like
we also have a tinted side panel window
plenty of water cooling and radiator
support because this is a full tower
case although it seems to be the at
least from here like it looks like it's
a relatively small full tower but when
you look inside there's actually tons of
tons of room for activities they've got
two more large 200 millimeter fans up
top there with that plenty of other
options you could swap that out for 360
millimetre radiator you could actually
have two of them installed
simultaneously there's also room for a
140 at the back
and additionally vertical GPU mounting
is natively supported I think you might
have to buy that PCI Express ribbon
cable separately however here's a quick
look at the marble shell in black they
actually have two variants the ms-20 and
the MS 30 the main differences being
micro ATX and full HDX support here we
have the lick max 3 performance 120
millimeter radiator and fan you can see
there's no RGB on the actual fan just on
the waterblock itself but it's very high
quality very familiar design that we've
seen from them in the past I
particularly like the way this looks as
long as there's no fingerprints on it
this is a convention though so there's
going to be we also have this one which
is the RGB version it's literally just
the same cooler but has an RGB fan still
RGB waterblock and then over here we
have addressable RGB because they know
they know they know that addressable RGB
is very popular in the US market despite
sometimes help addressable her GB
products not always being the best for
cooling
people people don't seem to care they
keep flying off the shelves so Animax is
going to continue making products that
people are buying we also have a look
max 3 tuff edition featuring addressable
RGB fans once
of course partnered with ASUS on this
one and that same classic design that we
all know and love the best thing about
all these coolers is that they're
featuring a very cool pump design that
they've been using for a while now but
they actually have a dual chamber design
here so you can see they actually have
the pump located above a channel where
the water would flow through so the
water goes directly down and it hits the
hottest part of your CPU first for
maximum heat dissipation before going
into the pump and recirculating it also
kind of separates the hottest part of
the CPU the hottest part of the liquid
from the pump itself so that it actually
increases the lifespan and longevity of
the pump
we also at Bullock tech - available in -
forty to eighty and three hundred and
sixty millimeter variants very popular
cooler I actually have a two hundred and
forty millimeter when installed in my in
one of my one of my workstation belts
and it's a it's still it's still going
it's still going strong
and then finally for coolers we have the
lick tech 360 Oct our four to four
thread ripper suck at TR four CPUs
so this thing is an absolute animal it
has a very large full cover water block
and we have of course these three fans
three 120 s doing the thing obviously
for TR four it's good to have a sizable
water block and sure enough they do this
also comes up in RGB controller as does
the lick tech - and of course you get
those same lovely fans no urge beyond
the fans which I I can appreciate 500
watt TDP now this is the last thing I
expected to see if the NR max booth is
an electric bike it's actually pretty
cool they've partnered up with the
company called Jack Wolfskin to make the
Maxwell hybrid 160 okay this is a pedal
assist it's a pedal assist in power so
there is a battery onboard but you do
have to do some work so as you pedal the
battery will scale up and actually help
you he'll propel you forward for
assisted pedaling and it actually is a
sort of a compact design it's much
smaller than your average adult person
bike and it looks like can fold as well
so if you wanted to pack this up for
travel or storage take it camping
wherever on the go perhaps the coolest
thing about this bike because I'm lazy
is that it's VR integrated so they
actually have a VR demo over here you
can see that the wheels are actually on
other wheels so it kind of just
treadmills in place but you can actually
tour around different parts of the world
using an HM DVR headset and on that note
the very last thing I'm going to show
you guys
is more or less that same bike but with
a PC built straight into it
typical enter max just putting pcs and
things or they don't belong or does it
belong perfectly and this is the future
I think I think we could all stand to do
some extra computing on our morning
commute to work what the hell's going on
here it's even liquid-cooled
this is ridiculous I think they're
trying to get in win and run for their
money okay wow that was a lot of cool
stuff Chris you look you look busy
we probably go to the next booth let's
do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
