B ok suka 182 oh my god jeez we're off
to a great start
yes you're right okay it's episode 132
and my monthly build this month I said
it was 2018 oh yeah that's right I
wanted to comment that but somebody else
be over there so this is a tech tech
news show that we'd like to do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware we also stream it into two
halves to our respective YouTube
channels this week the side a with
streams to Paul's channel you can find
the link to that in my video description
or you can go to youtube.com/scishow are
where and side B is of course stream to
my channel today so I thank you for
being here we appreciate it so we
appreciate all the support you guys are
awesome if you guys if you guys aren't
if you guys are new here we occasionally
have a drink or two on the show cheers
Cheers thank you
on ball occasional adult language is
used throughout the stream but only when
absolutely necessary and appropriate a
rogue hey hazelnut I have one of these
but it's this one this is a really good
doesn't that nectar is isn't that brown
nectar is a thing of beauty
and you're gonna tell segundo Mayberry
IPA new actually wifey sauces bro
brought this over last week and we even
kill it all when he was here so I'm
drinking the rest of it it's very good
it's a very good idea it's got a back
story it does alright so the other thing
is that we have stores that you can buy
things from so you should check out my
store which is biblioth√®que and there
you'll find an assortment of high
quality merchandise like shirts hoodies
mugs pint glasses and so forth you can
also buy something from Paul store has
his new captive thumb screw design yay
which is flying up the store shelves get
them while they're hot they'll blow on
hoodies hoodies shirts shirts the whole
nine the whole nine oh I like that the
screwdriver mug or the yet another screw
motor is that a redesign looks it's no
it's just a thumbs I got a photo
realistic what are you what do you go by
what serious but just shut up about
thumb screw and let me drink my coffee
is that what it's saying no that's
that's the let's the effect it gives off
yes so yeah go ahead and buy something
from our stores it's a it's great to
support us because we benefit directly
and well Johnson at you
well yell Johnson at you at the end of
the show in the after party all right
let's dive into our first news article
my half which is from Tom's Hardware
this is a been floating around the
internet though on all kinds of sites
about some sense mock-ups of Intel's new
discrete GPU and the sort of design that
it would take and close all online
oh you tab whore I know geez
save some space in the tab bar for the
rest of us there so so a lot of people
were losing their minds over these
mock-ups saying oh my god this is what
the new Intel discrete GPU featuring the
XE architecture will look like that but
it's not it's just an ER so chill out
calm your tits people so Intel like
commissioned a fan to make this didn't
even make a really Commission to fan
they just they have an outreach program
but what Intel launches these graphics
cards they'll look mostly like this nope
potentially nothing like them Paul but I
don't think it would be a bad idea if
they look like them because it looked
pretty good
I think looked nice this is just one guy
his name is C quitter Cristiano Sequeira
from Brazil he's a student from Brazil
not employed by Intel he just made some
fan art and they're really good so I
mean yeah you can tell why a lot of
people thought like this is an Intel
like I've got the XE logo and everything
yeah I really I mean there's a reason
why Intel showed these off at GDC this
year when this guy wasn't even employed
it was just fan on but one once the
images surfaced on the internet people
lost their minds and thought that this
was official these are official mock-ups
from Intel and this is what their
discreet GPS are actually gonna look
like which you know obviously show a
blower style fan you've got a dual slot
design and
lack of a PCIe power plug oh yeah well
well at least maybe you not one looks
like we got a six plus eight pin power
delivery at least in the first English
what can we tell about the actual GPU at
the heart of these cards absolutely
nothing because these are fake you're
not real or official Paul okay so that's
that's really the whole point of this
article is to just tell you these look
nice but they're not real but they're
not necessarily meaningless because
Intel might take some design cues from
from the community because this was
submitted through the their their
Odyssey program which is like an
outreach program to keep enthusiasts in
the know in the loop so to speak of what
Intel's up to and it's sort of a two-way
street
so if Intel sees any feedback from the
community they might take it into their
own their own base and and actually work
on it so who knows maybe they might
incorporate some of these design
elements from this Brazilian student in
their upcoming XE graphics cards so I
think they look nice too but they should
just take me to these designs and and
use them they should I mean it gives you
your credit to the designer oh
absolutely
this guy just did like hundreds of
thousands of dollars of work for you is
it yeah there's a good until it's like
oh I guess I get to take the next few
months off yeah all right it's chilling
all right next we have another article
from Tom's Hardware it specifically
because there's a professional
overclocker who who looked into this but
he's basically saying that the 9900 k f
KF SKU might be a much better
overclocker than the 9900 k there might
be a predisposition here so these are
this article follows the findings of
slave who's a pro xstream overclocker
and he basically says that you know
there's a chance here that the 9900 K is
just not quite as well equipped to
overclock as the K F skew is but
according to Intel the only difference
really is that the KF skew doesn't have
an IDP you
there's no integrated graphics it's just
disabled but what's interesting is that
they're the same price so you're
essentially paying the same amount of
money for the K F but you're getting one
less feature
kind of like losing the headphone jack
on your smartphone but paying more money
for it or the same so he did some
investigating he's an extreme
overclocker so he's actually tested two
hundred two hundred core I 999 hundred
KS that he's personally bend himself how
come he didn't put all of them on this
church because that's just an
aggregation you know that would be a
very long chart it's not even my fourth
monitor could could hold all that
information I want to see Steve like
gamers Nexus Steve do a video where he
like goes over each of these charts and
does like his Steve X chart expeditions
as you can see in the 90 okay is to give
it a five percent if he's over than I am
running it like I don't know I feel like
a 90 100 K number 27 did it three
percent better than 9900 Kade number 285
lat
okay beats tonight okay because they're
mine the 900k when overclocked is just
shy of the 1900 case performance when
you compare it to these up in 1900 case
so just bear that in mind that's here if
you're really thinking trying to make it
a purchasing decision to do without
missing a beat do so yeah it's kind of
interesting he actually took a bunch of
these in her case now I just feel weird
saying that yeah okay after you've said
it so many times so only 19 of those
chips could run Cinebench r15 at 5.3
gigahertz with normal water cooling but
out of his 5k excuse one of them was
able to run the benchmark at 5.4
gigahertz with the same amount of
cooling so you've got a much smaller
sample size of KF skis but yet you've
already found one that performs better
than any of the 9900 k's in this very
large sample size relatively large
sample size I mean 200 200 chips is
still incredibly small when you are
talking about the grand scheme of things
but compared to five I mean I would be
curious about where they were all
sourced from right yeah it sort of the
this is a unique experience that I had
when the 4700 K launched mm-hmm which
was that I had I got to take into I'm
sorry
we got a box of him uh-huh and when you
get Intel CPUs they come in just one
long box like that with a bunch of CPUs
in them it's quite so I took all I think
there were seven or eight of them I took
all of them and I just kind of tested
them all didn't you do a video on that
yeah yeah this is one of the earlier CPU
overclocking videos on my channel
I was able to compare them all but I was
able to tell all of them were actually
very very good bintu chips I mean they
weren't bent but they they all performed
very well compared to a lot of the other
reports of 47 under K overclocking
performance online right but that was
because they were false sequential they
were all cut from the same yeah pretty
much
they always though there is a chance if
you have a batch and they're all cut
from the same wafer that performs really
performance similary so right it might
not be as much of a you know sampling
across the range of your CPUs that are
available right yeah that's interesting
yeah that's a good point ball I'd be
curious to see where he sourced all
those chips from it was a badger here
and there but he said that on ln2 his
his golden 9900 KF sample the one that
hit 5.4 gigahertz reached six point nine
five gigahertz in Cinebench r15 which
was seventy-five megahertz higher than
his best performing 99 hundred K on ln2
so there's a bit of a he's starting to
nail down this pattern the sort of trend
that out of these few KF skis that I
have they're just seemingly clock for
clock doing a little bit better than the
night and heard case and why is that is
sort of how the the article concludes is
it that the the KS just haven't
naturally more refined or higher quality
silicon to them than the case use and if
that's the case why why is that the case
his other theory was that maybe the
disabling of an AI GPU on the KF skew
somehow inadvertently carries some some
overclocking benefits with having no
power pins from the socket which he
doesn't really explain why that would
work but he says crazier things have
happened which I suppose is true but
again these are just theories that he's
speculating
I think further testing is required but
his findings show that further testing
would is definitely a an intriguing
thing that that should happen because if
you can buy a if overclocking is your
hobby or you just want to get the most
clocks out of your chip and you can pay
the same price for a 9900 K but get an
additional 100 megahertz on eight cores
mind you I'm sure a lot of people will
be interested in that it's worth knowing
it's worth knowing and if somebody's
gonna buy a 99 hundred K and you know
you're not gonna need the I GPU then
right apparently you should buy the KF
yeah but certainly based on demystify
this the KF skewness seems reasonable to
me so next up we have just not really an
article but a YouTube video I like it
when we when we have YouTube videos
instead of articles cuz it's it's you
know it's helping out our fellow our
fellow Chum
Darren Jesse Durden he has nine
subscribers everyone go follow just dirt
and he did a really good video on this
although not to it Nhu 12a which is
their newest 9 subscriber so let's see
how many subscribers jesse has by the
end of this segment
yeah I want to engage our social
influencer here right so he did a really
good video on this core that we talked
about I think in the lake his video from
you you should last week I think we you
it despite a bit on your half yes talk
about this cooler it's a 120 millimeter
fan cooler it's got two fans included
these are super high high pressure high
static pressure radiator optimized and
it's much smaller I would say quite a
bit smaller than the flagship NHD 15 or
the D 15 s there I'm sorry my right
there so you can see it's gonna it's
it's a little bit smaller there hundred
forty millimeter class fans on the D
1520 millimeter on the any shoots well
they and the thing from the one factor
keeping this this new cooler from just
being an instant buy is its hefty price
tag of $99 us that's that's a lot for a
cooler of that size so he put it to the
test
he did a really good test and has good
graphs and stuff and basically what he
found is
it cools really well on part with a lot
of 140 millimeter coolers but it does
not outpace the d15 so it's like not to
a your own worst enemy and it's more
expensive than the D 15 that's more
right it's it's like yeah 10 to 20 bucks
more even okay um
so you know he basically boiled it down
to oh the other thing he found was that
it gets loud at at higher fan speeds he
tested it various fan speeds but without
lowering the temperatures further so
there comes a point where the fans keep
ramping up and it keeps being louder but
the temperatures stay the same okay he
was able to negate that however with the
included noise the noise reducer I'm
sorry the voltage reducer oh the low
noise adapters so it comes and clueless
and low noise adapters and with those he
was able to sustain better temperatures
with lower noise cool but um he said
that you know it's it's a very niche
market who would actually buy this
cooler because not to it has always been
really good about RAM compatibility so
even like the D 15 has 100% ram
compatibility for the most part so it's
almost like it you know this this this
new cooler looks a lot smaller but
compatibility isn't really an issue with
the D 15 unless you're talking about a
super small case he went on PC part
picker and I think there was like 3000
cases that that both coolers were
compatible with more or less or I'm
sorry out of 3000 cases or maybe was 300
no it was 3,000 cases the D 15 was only
there were only maybe 70 70 something 70
to 80 cases that weren't compatible with
that cooler where the where the u12 a
was so that's a very small percentage of
cases that you know that this cooler is
really going to be suited for that the D
15 can't be so I don't know at the end
you said if you're looking for something
that's smaller and maybe you like to
aesthetic better and you're willing to
pay the extra premium then go for it but
for the most part the d15 is still king
when it comes to nook two air coolers
and it can be had for a lower price than
this new one so no one should buy Noctua
coolers they should buy no two of
coolers instead that is exactly right
and wrong at the same time no it's
pretty sound until you look at it he
could have just summed it up with that
one sentence I guess moved on so it's
really designed for people who really
want to be able to see their ram yeah I
mean you can't does pretty much yeah I
mean if you've got some are GB RAM which
is you know it's pretty common nowadays
then you want to show that off perhaps
that's the way way to go but is it worth
you know 20 bucks extra for that
privilege I guess if you're spending the
extra money on our GB RAM then I just I
just want to see all black versions not
to it mm-hmm
teas desks with all black versions at
Computex yeah just woman just want that
that's all
wow they got to make money off of their
through chrome ax accessories sometimes
I guess but let's move on to this
article from overclocked 3d net about
Nvidia wait wait let's check Jessie oh
oh yeah Jessie what are you at I say
where Jessie's up to 143 Wow holy
good Jeff oh my god yeah and make sure
to drop a comment on you know his Noctua
video I don't know that we sent you so
he's just not like completely confused
and he opens a good job chat ok good job
alright so Nvidia Nvidia is enabled
g-sync compatible monitor support in
surround setups and will circle back to
that but it's the it's the the geforce
driver for 19.6 7 that brings the
announcement of two new monitors having
been validated with g-sync
as g-sync compatible it's the asus VG 2
7 8 QR and the BG 2 5 8 both of these
are sort of like budget value oriented
1080p screens with the 165 Hertz and 144
hertz refresh rate respectively
NVIDIA has also confirmed that surround
support is now possible with Jason
compatible displays with
which has not been possible on previous
drivers 300 bucks for that 144 Hertz
version by the way not to Shetty I'm
curious yeah is a TN panel or IPS
probably TN yeah usually the or error or
the other one it says one millisecond
response time but it if there's no
motion of you know or if there's no
mention of ultra-low motion blur it's
probably 10 so the other thing about
surround support coming to jeast
incompatible displays is that VA that's
it might be VA okay it could be VA is
that it's Turing only no Pascal support
for some reason they have not mentioned
why Pascal GPUs are not supported at the
moment with this new feature so so it's
only turning there's just kind of a
bummer if you don't have turning and all
the displays must be plugged into the
primary GPU and they also have to be
identical same make and model you have
to have three of the same monitors
exactly in order for surround to work
and it has to be a Turing GPU and all
the monitors have to be plugged in to
that primary GPU for the primary GPU you
can only use it between 70 and 95
yeah seems slightly restrictive but yeah
it definitely I'm guessing that broader
support will come with feature updates
future driver updates and stuff
let's see shedding some light on on what
it takes to qualify as a GCM compatible
display because details have been pretty
pretty minimal up to this point nvidia
is revealed that such monitors must
offer variable refresh rate range of two
by four by one and offer no blanking
flickering ghosting or other artifacts
during variable refresh rate gaming
workload so as an example if you had a
144 hertz g-sync compatible monitor it
would need to provide a variable refresh
rate range of 60 to 144 hertz
at minimum in order to qualify as
juicing compatible so I'm just noticing
here sorry
I pulled up both of these monitors that
just recently got approved for Nvidia
g-sync support g-sync compatible
adaptive sync gaming monitor so this
appears to be how they will be marketing
these formerly free sync monitors that
are now not technically G sync with the
chip but Jesus incompatible and approved
right so there it is that one where he
said it's 300 this one's cheaper it's
24-inch goes up 265 Hertz but this is
something you guys should definitely
look closer at especially with some of
these free sync displays that you might
be using with g-sync the free sync range
or the adaptive sync range is 40 to 75
Hertz yeah that's on the HDMI port Oh Oh
as a do full 75 Hertz with adaptive sync
so that's not 165 165 which it looks to
be people think oh wow I'm gonna get
super clean you know no terror
experience at super high frame rates but
yeah check the range guys the range is
more important than the peak the peak
frequent the peak refresh rate or
advertised good point fall all right
let's move on to our last article for
now this is from WCC of tech once again
we're talking about Asus this time in a
more positive light okay
Asus notebook models in question are the
ROG GU 502 D you and the tough FX 505 vu
both of these models were found in
3dmark listings by two FS AK as usual to
do member sec thank you very much for
these leaks sir and whoever's testing
these notebooks just disconnect your
internet next time you're in benchmarks
this is already known that it's already
been known that Asus was planning a
tough notebook with Verizon 3000 with
horizon 3000 processor but they never
mentioned support for NVIDIA discreet
GPUs and so this new discovered listing
reveals that these models are going to
be using discrete Turing GPUs the rog gu
502 d you is gonna ship with horizon 737
50 h which is which is a fork or a
thread part at 2.3 gigahertz base with a
4 gigahertz boost it's on the e 12
millimeter
process nude with a 35 watt TDP features
Vega 10 integrated graphics but the
laptops also gonna be packin a GTX 16 60
nice sorry that was a really weird burp
so that's kind of painful now very it
was a little hurt gtx 1660 TI max q
discrete GPU so this is the first
sighting also of the gtx 660ti mobile
variant that that we know of and as far
as mobile gtx 660ti you can expect
similar core specs like 1536 cuda cores
and 6 gigs of gddr5 sorry 6 memory clock
speeds are up in the air however
depending on whether the GPUs are gonna
be max-q or non max q obviously this
one's already been specified as max Q
but the tough notebook is is actually
gonna have a an on max Q GTX 1660 Ti the
trade-off there is that it has a
slightly slower rise in 5:35 50h CPU
with 4 cores and 8 threads 2.1 gigahertz
base and 3.7 gigahertz boost but the
benefits of having an on max Q GPU from
vidya is that it's probably gonna have
higher clocks and thus greater gaming
performance it might get a little hotter
it might drain your battery a little bit
more but you know the the gtx 1660 TI
max Q or not is a pretty powerful card
so so you're probably looking at pretty
decent battery life compared to
something like one of those RT x powered
notebooks that we've seen so that's fun
left up with a 1080 screen 1080p screen
16 60 TI and risin risin 7 I could I get
a get behind that how much does it cost
yeah all we know is I mean this is this
was leaked
so I mean pricing is probably a long way
off but 800 bucks for what the risin 5
1-3 or the 6 exotic seems yeah I don't
think so no I think that's pretty
optimistic
all right yeah man laptops are pricey
because they're cramming all that
engineering work and just small cuz its
ASIS small footprint plus yeah you got
that yeah it's not just issues it's like
an ro G for the tough one it's their top
of the line ROG and and then tough which
is also you know there's a premium for
tough - that's not as premium over
premium though no of course not
but it's still pretty like a Zen book I
did the the builds I did last month's
wasn't this bounce house this one where
were 1660 T is donated to eight hundred
dollar bills so you can easily fit a
sixteen sixty TI and an eight and an
eight hundred dog build yeah
with a pretty decent CPU as well yeah
either like a six core Rison or a six
corn on hyper threaded in cell sure but
anyway good so let's all it build
alright that's that's all for tech news
okay we have pin my PC next pip bumpers
soon yeah where we pent up your crappy
looking rig the crap you're the better
cuz it gives us more things to talk
about so I pick some ease some
ease today I'm gonna call you guys
shitty now they're not all super cheese
and some are super shitty
all right so we got a ciggy we are Oh
sick weirdo so can we have a tuna I said
he named his system dubbed Neptune very
blue all right so he's got a core i5 66
66 hundred skylake cpu 16 gigs of DDR 4
cheese skill memory a gigabyte gah 170
and Wi-Fi motherboard 8 gigs of oh I'm
sorry gigabyte 8 gig gtx 1070 and you're
rockin that inside of an NZXT h200 case
ok so very clean cable management yeah
really clean really really
but there's something standing out here
what is it that's that cooler I don't
know a stock cooler first I was like it
looks like an AMD stock cooler with an
LED fan swapped into it
definitely not I don't know it's just
some third-party obscure yeah I guess I
owe named cooler yeah it looks good it
matches yeah it looks fine I wonder how
much he paid for his sleeps cable
extensions they look a little on the
budget side they look fairly economical
for further on the budget side honestly
you know just because I hate seeing
builds we're like a hundred bucks was
dropped on the sleeps cable extensions
when there's other room for where we're
up yeah we're upgrades that would
improve the performance yeah otherwise
available sure but I mean he's got a
pretty DS got pretty decent core specs
though like a sub n it 60 610 70 so yeah
that's these flying nothing to complain
about that I was gonna say if that was a
stock cooler then I would complain a
little bit about that but it's not buddy
and it looks it looks good and I don't
know it doesn't look like a real high
performance cooler just like the style
it is and it looks like most it probably
prefer one got more with the stock
cooler but yeah and it's a 6600 it's not
overclockable so yeah you don't need to
go crazy
alright so it's appropriate I also
approve of that he has a UPS well done
all done with the UPS day oh yeah some
of those so I don't know do you have any
I thought you said you got uglies Kelvin
ugly I said shitty ease but this
isn't chitti's either okay no no this is
actually like the best one out of out of
the bunch if if I was really gonna pimp
it out I would maybe get RAM that has
nice-looking heat spreaders on them
because your RAM is just like straight
PCB yeah with memory modules on them
that could really up the look I think
what I'm having a hard time with here if
we're talking about aesthetics is that
you have a really attention-grabbing CPU
cooler with a bright LED but there's no
LEDs elsewhere and so everything else
like you're not accentuating other parts
of the system I kind of like that
actually just the well you're wrong your
opinions wrong okay no III anaesthetics
are obviously very subjective
but you know I think I think it's a
really nice-looking build I'd like to
see it see more of it in the dark and
maybe some additional illumination in
fantasy looks like there's no intake
fans oh you need some intake that's a
negative pressure before you do anything
aesthetic get some intake fans and I
begin gtx 1070 can can use some extra
cooling nice clean build those a query
it's a very good very good off to a good
start next we have our Gonzales with a
core i7 8700 K 32 gigs of course at ram
gigabyte our TX 27 t OC and a fan tax
evolve x case it's my favorite case cuz
it's the one I used for hotline to damn
and this is also not a bad not a bad
system yeah you're lying
your lies I had a headache amp it up
somehow okay alright I like the black
and red theme I think yeah everything's
matching there's no standing out color
here that doesn't belong I think your
extensions at least on the GPU could use
some cable combs they look really clean
with your 24 pin ATX but they see ie
power cables Oh picture okay I was
looking at a difference it's like
clarity did okay
no good maybe you've got a before and
after or maybe they're maybe they were
slid down below the power supply show
okay but this might be and moving them
up server that's taken care of Kyle yes
okay oh my guest fix we've ever had on
put my PC you need okay in that case add
that to the CPU the Supplemental CPU
could use ik the combs in this case yeah
which looks like actually in this last
picture isn't even there yet so that
must have been an added extension ooh an
extension extension yes um your
front-facing fans at least in this
picture like the fan text logo is
sideways on the bottom fan but it's
right side up on on the top fan it's
it's a small same pic it's a small
nitpick but that's becoming one of your
pet peeves I think it has always been a
pet peeve of mine okay it's been more
vocal about it Reese
me I was gonna say it's only giggles is
purely aesthetic but the top two fans
for exhaust seems sort of oddly spaced
there's a gap between them yeah it's
like a bad boob job maybe you were just
trying to avoid like a cross bar at the
top there but push them together as long
as it's an aero crossbar like it
shouldn't really affect your airflow for
exhaust she's just there I would I would
push those two getting yeah that's
pretty much it
obviously a lot of attention paid to
DEET some details and aesthetics here so
right also he's got an oculus rift on
top there that's nice it's nice it's
good setup more use than mine getting uh
mr. Gonzales Lorenzo lacking the lights
i 770 700 a 6h 270 Strix MSI GTX 1080 32
gigs of ram freckled fine see full specs
and more at the peace perfect a list all
right hey you know what this is a pretty
pretty good pretty good
really why did you say that you got
completely forgot clearly I forgot all
the all the Briggs I'm pretty good
looking so far minor quibbles yes so got
the front man at a IO within the
push-pull configuration we got some
fractal venturi fans but not on the
exhaust back here so that's the thing
that sort of stands out to me a little
bit I really like fractals wintery fans
yeah
and just one more one more for your
exhaust they would match everything up
yeah I mean it's not a horribly horrible
mismatch this fractal has the white
accents on stuff and you got white flam
blades I'd black it out yeah i black out
all I'd get more I just buy expansion
slots and replace all the white ones and
then get into another fractal venturi
sorry the front I was looking at it from
a different angle so right right looks
like an airflow venturi fan it's black
and then we've got white on the
all-in-one make them all uniform so yeah
uniform oh so you wanted to get a white
airflow down here the freckle venturi
white blade fans though it should
I should they should okay so this
because of their theme of their existing
cases so this is probably what came with
the case there yeah that's a stock case
man okay
then he added those cal management looks
real clean
real clean appreciate the the back the
reverse photo to real quick nice you
know it's great well done there the msi
card is red yeah that's very that's your
complete as a fact it does it is right
it's really red thing yeah
whoa exactly exactly why it bothers me
if anything I just want you to change
your LED options here because you've got
some LED backlighting on if they were
all red maybe it would it would kind of
blend with the graphics care a little
bit more yeah would be one way to skirt
it but yeah my minor quibble is all
around this is a real clean build yeah I
did a really bad job admissions well
done there Enzo all right this is from
Vincent code Core i5 7600 K MSI m3 is
East Sea 270 and ACSR TX 2070 Strix 16
gigs of course a ram and HX 1000 PSU and
at NZXT s340 elite great choice on the
case and what do we got here okay kinda
looks like your cables need some
training cable combs or training that
just looks like hanging spaghetti yeah
it looks kind of like you know and these
are Caesars custom sleeve loose these
are sleeved cables I mean let's say
they're an extension kit or something
like that so maybe even try it out like
yeah either train them or you know I
know these type of cables I've used
these cables for years and even with
cable trainers sometimes they don't look
great
so maybe what I would do was instead
just take some velcro straps or a velcro
strap and just cinch them down so they
kind of look more tethered just more
grouped together so they're not just
like loose and stuff and I can really
form them a bit better than okay
trainers he gave us a close-up of what
you're talking about right there yeah he
was trying to show us the historic Lego
which I appreciate
there you know you gotta have a theme a
mascot something like that
ooh that GPS tag is also pretty bad GPX
standing out so here's what you need we
want this is a stormtrooper white Ram I
don't know why I thought that was a SAG
corrector cable fixer so get like a
bantha like to go along with your
stormtrooper that stands underneath the
graphics card to give it some support or
an ETA T or an 88 Ewok or something like
that
another night cable training and that's
all that's all and donate your RAM to
the last guy with the red msi card
instead ah oh no this is the NZXT module
you I thought it was a cardboard box at
first though the cardboard box the
accessories came in mounted there that'd
be kind of fun all right Thank You
Vincent
functional nice build thank you thank
you and then next up we have Tony
alright rise of seven 1700 X 16 gigs of
DDR for 3,000 speed xlr8 gaming 2080
of course there are M 750 asus rog be
350f and looks like you've got a
Roseville Cullinan the 500 cased the
cooler master ml 240 yeah okay okay very
red
it looks pretty alright so I like the
desk shot you got here cuz you can see
this the system with the side panels on
the tempered glass and the red lights
inside looks real nice yes but I also
appreciate that you gave us the
close-ups with the inside of the case
too because yeah this is where some work
could be done kale management is not bad
when it comes to routing or anything
like that I just feel like there's some
finishing touches that could be made
you've got a really just weird kind of
loopy cable coming off here yeah it's
like it might be for a may be part of
the cooler pump or something like that
just either sips that down do something
similar with the cable you have running
down here to plug in
your rear fan that's just a fan header
that let's plug it in there yeah and
then something about something for your
little daisy chain dongle there at the
end the graphics card supplemental power
you can just cinch all that up close and
tight with the zip tie yeah it doesn't
look too bad I don't clean that up or
you know of course cable extensions
always an option not necessary in in in
your system I think but yeah just just a
little bit of work there I don't what do
you think of the all-in-one cooler
tubing it's a little deranged again just
just like you probably need to do
anything you can just sort of angle
that's how the tubes are coming off with
a cooler and maybe just kind of push and
a little bit more maybe strap them
together yes sometimes you're just
getting a simple piece of velcro and
wrapping around there just to kind of
keep them keep them tight yeah yeah so
just some real minor updates and then I
would consider finally a heatsink for
your ears what is that 240 gig em that
to SSD the WD logo on that standing out
you can either keep that off the label
or just get a heatsink to throw over
that either way other way to work that's
standing out big big green splotch it
doesn't look all that great anything
else to add cow no I think you pretty
much covered a pole okay looks good okay
alright and we have one more Chris more
submission but this is a before and
after so this is who Chris actually
submitted his his rig to pin my PC
earlier and he has some before and after
shots before he submitted and after he
submitted so we actually get to see him
improve is it before before okay nice
yes in disgust yes Jesus Christ he
needed us
I can't believe that the Lord the
computer would even be used by anyone
this is even boot or anything so ugly it
doesn't even do a bit Hey what's now and
then after oh look at that
Oh clean removed a graphics card wait
why didn't you remove the graphics card
no he didn't oh he oh yes one of them
well we oh here's completely different
we gave him a hard time for his ugly
crossfire cable crossfire bridge right I
remember that very specifically yep so
apparently he has just updated the
graphics card altogether yeah maybe he's
got a faster GPU yeah and that's fine
that's it that's a totally valid
solution to that problem
yeah I've got some sleeve cables as well
all right so we got some sleeve cable
extensions it's like a nice actually
ties in very well with the motherboard
you're dealing with a motherboard color
scheme that asus was very happy with
briefly p67 yeah he's 77 days right
before they I didn't mind that you had a
yeah that's my first build you have it
though like colored @p 67 yeah the light
blue but hard to match especially if
you're dealing with newer components
that are very often like all black yeah
right um to RGB all right if we want a
finishing touch here that I think would
really blend everything in together
nicely you've got some not too a chrome
axe fans right I heard these Noctua fans
you can buy replacements corners for
them yeah I feel like if I those were
either all whites or all blue or maybe
even a mixture of them yeah I think that
would tie everything in together and I
know you're David I said before and
after like here it's done now but now
we've given you another task to do right
but that aside everything looks real
nice with the update so it's so well
done very good job and thanks for for
following up it's cool to see ya
somebody come back we get and we get
those tweeted ads from time to time when
people said I Katie you've talked about
my PC mmm I see here I fixed it now we
should do it before and after edition at
some point that would be nice all right
cool something that's that's all for my
half y'all alright so don't go anywhere
we're gonna be doing after party after
party for a smidge and we'll be reading
off all the messages you've attached to
the donations very generous of you guys
as well as shouting Johnson to anyone
who purchased anything from our stores
if you haven't purchased anything yet
you still have a last last chance you
still have a couple minutes before
before we stand off so I can do that
thank you - what's what's the guy's name
who does the timestamps
your everyday tech your everyday tag has
been doing them
thank you your everyday tech in advance
for doing timestamps and if he's sick
actually I'd like for I'd like three or
four people do timestamp last week so I
didn't actually pin here every day text
but he did them - Wow
and sorry it's hard he was somebody's
gunning for his job a lot of people
putting in work there you want to give
credit watch your back every day tech
people want to be you alright guys thank
you so much
we are back hey I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
