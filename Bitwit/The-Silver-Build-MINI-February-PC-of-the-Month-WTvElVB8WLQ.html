I've been using Squarespace to host the
channels official site and merchandise
store for about two years now and
compared to building a site from scratch
the difference has been PC and console
the clean UI makes it easy to create and
customize content embed YouTube videos
social media posts and add new items to
our store a simplified all-in-one
platform means you never have to install
patch or upgrade anything and I can tell
you firsthand there 24/7 customer
support is better than most tech
companies in the PC space they'll tell
them I said that Squarespace has

back to the channel so for February's PC
of the month I thought it would be a
great opportunity to rekindle an old
flame of mine see back in October of
2016 I put together the silver build
which till this day ranks as one of my
favorite systems I've ever put together
mainly because of its stunning good
looks like system like owner as they say
so I figured what better way to pay
homage to this beautiful machine than by
making a miniature version of it that's
right the silver build is getting its
very own mini-me and not only will the
system be significantly smaller and ten
times more adorable but it'll be
sporting modern high-end components that
go well beyond the performance of its
full-size predecessor I've said it once
and I'll say it again people size does
not matter not that I need to live by
that statement by now I'm sure you guys
are dying to see the rest of the
hardware behind me you know I'm kind of
covering up some of the good stuff so
why don't we swap places really quick
and take a look at the parts will be
using for today's build our processor is
the Intel Core i7 8700 K which is still
the fastest gaming CPU on the market but
since we have two more cores and four
more threads than the 6600 K we're
replacing this will also make a killer
chip for heavily multi threaded
workstation applications which is pretty
sweet
we'll be pairing our CPU with the asus
rog Strix z 370 i gaming this guy is
loaded with all the features you could
ever want on a mini ITX motherboard but
let's face it I would use this thing
even if it didn't have a socket just to
have those sexy silver heat sinks
I take that back it should really have a
socket you know what's nice about the
corsair dominator platinum everything
speed reliability and oh look more
silver yes this is the same 16 gigabyte
ddr4 3000 kit that I used in the
original silver build and I'm doing so
again in this one without shame to honor
Papa silver I'm sticking with an EVGA
geforce card but we're upgrading from a
gtx 1070 to a 1080 TI this card alone is
probably worth more than the rest of the
parts for this build combined now let's
move along before it gets awkward Oh too
late
lucky for me the EVGA 1080 Ti has dual 8
pin power connectors just like the 1070
we used before it meaning we can reuse
the custom sleeved extensions that n
source made for the original build can
you still feel your legs ladies and
gentlemen or have your pants gotten too
tight one caveat of the 8700 k is that
it tends to run warm especially when
over Clarke so here we have a corsair h
100 ib 2 all-in-one liquid cooler like
our ram we're borrowing this part from
the original for its high performance
and color scheme now when i was choosing
the parts i overlooked the fact that our
case only supports s FX and s FX l power
supplies and this is really the only
decent one i had on hand the corsair SF
450 if i was planning to use the system
long term I would definitely upgrade to
at least an SF 600 especially if we plan
to overclock our CPU and GPU but for the
purpose of this build this should
service just fine now this build would
not be a proper successor without the
Noctua redux fans and their silvery
aesthetic so on the right we have a pair
of NFS 12 b's and beside them to our ace
which are the cutest 80 millimeter fans
I've ever seen just adorable for storage
we have a single samsung 250 gig 960 Evo
m2 nvme SSD a tried and true option that
really is the best choice because you're
too poor to afford a 960 Pro finally we
have the Lian Li pcq 37 as our beautiful
canvas for today's build with its full
aluminum chassis and tempered glass side
panels this thing is sick get well soon
and that is our Rockstar lineup of
hardware for today's rig the total cost
of the system ranges between oh god the
pain Y and your 401k with that said
folks it's time I leave you momentarily
to go off and assemble the silver
old 2.0 mini
well the builds done and what did we
learn we learned that this case is very
particular about which GPUs it can
actually fit length is pretty much not a
problem it can fit full-size GPUs even
extra long ones height however is a
bottleneck for example you might notice
we have the original gtx 10:17 here
that's because we could not fit the 1080
TI inside it just would not work it was
way too tall the cooler was just at
least a centimeter or so too freakin
high even this card hardly fit I had to
bend one of the corners of our side
panel mounts where the threaded hole is
just to get it to fit and even then it
barely scraped by after getting the card
in I was sure that the worst was behind
me but no turns out because the cooler
is just a little too high for this case
with the 8 pin connectors particularly
the cable sticking out here don't allow
the side panel to close so here we have
an open frame system now since I'm not
planning to use this system for anything
I don't really care in fact it'll
probably get disassembled within the
next month or so but even still if I was
using this as a daily driver or
something like that I might even
consider leaving the side panel off one
because it's incredibly quiet all the
Noctua fans even the 80 millimetres are
dead quiet see I said quiet not silent
because you can still kind of hear them
but they are really quiet and there's
really not a ton of airflow going to our
GPU right now in fact I don't know if
there's any airflow going to it other
than its own fans on the cooler because
you do have the option to install to 120
millimeters on this metal plate
underneath the card if you so wish but I
did not but I'd imagine even if you did
mount some fans down here the GPU
especially a large one like this one
would block any airflow going to the
rest of our components so for that
reason I would probably use this in an
open-air configuration anyway apart from
everything that went wrong in the lower
half of the system I am really happy
with how it turned out
even though the Corsair logo on our
radiator is upside down that kind of
size
I could have flipped the radiator but
then the tubes would've been all cramped
and bunched up on the left side of the
case and it just wouldn't worked out
well of course like most movies the
original tends to be the best and there
were a few compromises we had to make
shrinking down to a small form-factor
case for one there's no room at all for
an LED strip no where that makes sense
anyway we could put one on the glass
panel but that would be dumb
there's also no denying just how
perfectly that silver end through
evolved ATX case from fantex matched the
overall color scheme of our first build
and here we get more or less a plain
black chassis however beautiful it is
not silver
and I wasn't gonna spray-paint it
because that takes too long but again
like I said very happy with how it
turned out you guys let me know what you
think and also stay tuned for part two
and we test acoustics thermals
overclocking benchmarks and all that fun
stuff guys if you enjoyed this video be
