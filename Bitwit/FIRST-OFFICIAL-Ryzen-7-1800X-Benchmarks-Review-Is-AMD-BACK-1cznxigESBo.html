YouTube subscription feed will
undoubtedly indicate AMD's high-end line
of eight cores sixteen thread Rison
seven chips have just hit the market
comprised of three SKUs based on the Zen
architecture from lowest to highest they
include the r7 1,700 1,700 X and the
1800 X at their press event last month
in San Francisco AMD revealed an
aggressive pricing scheme and touted
some impressive data against the
competition bear in mind of course to
always take manufacturer benchmarks with
a tiny grain of salt while I won't be
able to give an analysis of the r7
lineup in its entirety today AMD did
send me home with their flagship r7 1800
X a response to Intel's Core i7 6900 pay
for about half the MSRP at just 500 us
the price points will be easily
confirmed by trusted online retailers so
that leaves the proof of performance on
the shoulders of the reviewers to see if
the 1800 X is the disruptive animal AMD
claims it to be that said there's still
much to discuss about team Reds newcomer
before it steps into the Octagon with
its heavyweight rival to reiterate some
of the vital specs to 1800 x packs a
lower 95 watt TDP than the 60 900k with
a base clock of 3.6 gigahertz and an
auto boosting technology that functions
similarly to intel's turbo boost in
multi-threaded workloads the risin chip
will boost all cores to 3.7 gigahertz a
boost to 4 gigahertz is possible but
this only applies to a single core
during a single-threaded task during my
single core runs in Cinebench r15
hardware monitors showed one and
sometimes two of the cores boosting to
4.1 gigahertz
while the others remained at their idle
state frequencies this extra 100 mega
Hertz is courtesy of AMD's extended
frequency range or XF our technology
which bumps the core to 4.1 gigahertz if
cooling conditions allow as far as I
know AMD hasn't confirmed exactly how
this is defined but clearly my Noctua
air cooler and ambient temperature of 24
C helps XFR reach its threshold
since all but one of today's tests
utilize multiple cores however exif are
and the single core boost feature won't
have much of a positive impact on
performance so I decided to overclock
all cores on both CPUs for two
benchmarks at AMD's press events the rep
hosting their overclocking demo
recommended enthusiasts not push past
the 1800 X's stock V core of 1.3 5 volts
so staying at the base voltage I was
able to achieve just 3.9 gigahertz
before reaching any instability suffice
to say if you were hoping for overclocks
well beyond the 4 gigahertz mark you'll
be sorely disappointed unless you keep a
tank of ln2 handy the rep did mention
the facility lottery will pay out the
occasional 4 or 4.1 gigahertz part with
4.2 gigahertz capable chips being more
of a Powerball jackpot now given rising
slow TDP compared to its Intel
counterparts I was excited to test
thermals today but for starters the chip
is still too fresh to be fully
recognized in the usual suite of
monitoring apps and even if they were
I've been informed by the ever so
perspicacious Steve of gamers Nexus that
writing temps may not be represented
properly via the software due to AMD
using similarly faulty temperature
diodes as their older FX chips - no one
surprised gamers Nexus has the proper
equipment to sidestep this issue so in
the description I've linked their rise
in video for those interested to learn
more you probe that chip you hear me
Steve you probe it good now we're just
about ready to go gloves off with these
two but first a quick look at the
separate test beds we'll be using
you'll notice our 6900 K has been
overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz and we're
using the same memory capacity and
frequency albeit a quad core channel kit
4 X 99 the knock to a cooler on our 1800
X was a special AMD Edition that only
included an am 4 bracket so for the i7 I
employed the most similarly Specht air
cooler I had on hand this cooler master
hyper 212 Evo both systems are running
the GTX 1080 founders Edition with the
latest 378 dot 66 Nvidia driver and all
games were tested at 1920 by 1080 2560
by 1440 and 3840 by 2160 aka 4k without
dragging this out any longer folks it's
finally time to see how these two CPUs
stack up and who will go home with all
the glory assuming they don't tie then I
guess they would split the glory it
doesn't matter
ladies and gentlemen here are the
benchmark
you
all right so as the data shows the 1800
X is by far and away the fastest
processor from AMD that we have seen in
years with the current pricing at the
time of publication of this video it's
an easy pick over the 69 hundred K for
video editors on a quote-unquote budget
as it delivers some quick encoding times
that would likely be unmatched by a
quad-core i7 until 6 core 6800 K may
still be in the running however in game
our two contenders saw a handful of
snail mates but if you look closely this
was a repeatable trend at the higher
resolutions of 1440p and 4k indicating a
GPU bottleneck at 1080p when the test
becomes CPU bound the 1800 X falls
behind every time suffering the most in
doom apart from having favorable 0.1%
loathes and Metro last light with
concerning 0.1% lows and 8.5% slower
averaged frame rates now it's been
established that the 7700 K is higher
IPC often makes it the better gaming
chip over the 6900 K so this positions
the 1,800 X as a less compelling option
for diehard gamers especially at a 43%
price hike over flagship KB link one
area where eight core Rison appears
suited for gaming is when live encoding
is thrown into the mix playing doom on
ultra quad HD while streaming out 1080
60 scaled all 16 of our logical cores
and kept up with the 69 hundred K by
delivering fluid gameplay and zero
dropped frames in this regard the 1800 X
makes a case for hardcore streamers who
might value the encoding capabilities
over raw fps particularly if they'll
also be cutting up highlight reels with
video
being software additionally users
interested in purely gaming should
continue looking to the i5 and i7 KT
like options for now from a gamers
perspective AMD may have lost this first
battle but the war is far from over as
we inch ously wait to see if upcoming
rise in parts will offer higher
instructions per clock to better compete
with kb lake that's all I got for now
guys so let me know in the comments what
you think of rising so far and how its
measured up to your expectations before
you guys go don't forget to toss me a
like on this video if you enjoyed it you
can also check out my store and get 5
bucks off if you buy one of each of my
two new shirt designs evolution and
crystal RGB because together we can
light up some crystal as always I am
Kyla bit with thank you guys so much for
watching subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and I will see y'all in
the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
