you guys need a legit website for your
tech YouTube channel blog or whatever
the dot tech squad is offering $5 tech
domains until April 8th with the code
awesomesauce this is a new initiative so
many domain names haven't been taken yet
that's why I was able to score
awesomesauce tech before any of you guys
could snag it first and try selling it
to me later
trolls go check it out I put a link in
the description okay bye
what's up guys so back in January I
loaded up my car full of gear and drove
out to Las Vegas Nevada to cover CES
2016 among the essentials was my sleeper
PC which served as my editing machine
for all my event coverage and while I
had no problems hauling it around in my
rickety hatchback the rig isn't quite
portable enough to join me on upcoming
events that I'll be traveling to by
playing on the agenda is copy Texan
type-a and the fast approaching land
syndicate in Seattle hosted by my
friends over at X syndicate speaking of
which I am super pumped to see some of
you guys there and I'll put a link in
the description for those of you
interested in joining us for a weekend
of gaming and craft beer debauchery so
in order to kick both of these events in
the balls today I'm building a high end
machine that's small enough to fit in my
carry-on bag that's why I'm dubbing
today's build the go anywhere do
anything PC which is really misleading
if you think about it but pay that no
mind what's important to note here
ladies and gentlemen is that the rig is
designed around flexibility on the go so
whether it be gaming editing or
streaming I'm equipped to handle any
number of use case scenarios with
above-average performance at that on
that note let's dive into the parts that
we'll be using for my new traveling
companion starting with the node 202
from fractal design I tend to think of
this mini ITX case as being in an office
or an HTPC environment but it's slim
profile makes it a prime choice for
computing abroad as well the chassis
features front panel USB three
thoughtful ventilation for the core
components and fractals Integra 450 watt
sfx power supply which has an 80 plus
bronze certification it seems the only
part of this case I won't be taking full
advantage of is its generous GPU
clearance but not without good reason up
until this point I've only read articles
and seen videos of this petite
powerhouse but I've
for some time now that the AMD r9 nano
would make its way into one of my bills
eventually this reference Fiji based
offering from power color is a mini ITX
builders wet dream and I can't think of
a better video card for today's build
for gigs of HB m direct x12 support and
killer performance are packaged inside
the cards adorable 6-inch cooler which
almost looks disproportionate in the no
202 s large GPU chamber but screw it
I'll gladly take the extra breathing
room cable management space and overall
lighter build when traveling another
quality that makes the r9 nano a great
choice here is performance per watt
while it's fast enough to max out pretty
much any game at quad HD the 175 watt
TDP is well within the capabilities of
our 450 watt power supply with
additional room for overclocking not to
mention the single a pin PCIe connector
will help alleviate cable clutter our
CPU of choice is the Intel skylake core
i7 6700 K that I'll be pairing with the
NHL 9 I cooler from Noctua let me be the
first to point out here that a lot
processor might have been a wiser choice
since not much overclocking can be done
with this cooler despite its reputation
for being a great low profile performer
that being said I already had a 6700 K
on hand so by golly I'm gonna use it
with limited overclocking potential raw
power and hyper threading are really the
key benefits of this quad core chip that
will aid immensely in my gaming and
editing workloads for RAM we have a 16
gigabyte kit of HyperX savage ddr4 at
1866 which will populate this stunning
mini ITX motherboard from MSI the z170 I
gaming Pro AC now again the OC
capabilities of the z170 chipset here
might be a moot point with our CPU
cooler but beyond the scope of
overclocking this board comes packed
full of features like Intel Gigabit LAN
USB 3.1 connectivity up the wazoo and
built-in 802 11 AC Wi-Fi I can also
appreciate a good onboard sound chip and
the gorgeously fierce aesthetic making
this one of the sexiest z170 boards at
this form factor the feature I'm most
excited to use on this bad boy however
is the PCIe gen3 by 4 m2 SSD slot with
Samsung's 512 gig nvme 950 Pro the
vertical NAND in this drive is some of
the fastest currently available at the
consumer level and the insane sequential
reads and writes this drive hits with
compressible data will do wonders for
video editing and adobe premiere for
games media and just about everything
else that is a raw footage waiting to be
edited I'll be using a 960 gig HyperX
savage this SSD was formally installed
in hot line until I realized I hadn't
written anything to the drive in months
so it's about time we get some mileage
out of it with the 950 Pro this gives
the system around 1.5 terabytes of
solid-state storage which I'm feeling
pretty good about so that wraps up our
list of hardware and I put links to all
the things in the description below now
if you don't mind it's time for me to
strip these parts of their packaging and
procreate some ones and zeros don't
worry you can watch
all right the build is complete and
looking good I might add but I did have
to spend a lot of time getting those
cables nice and tidy like most mini ITX
cases that are designed for portability
cable management in the node 202 was
about as graceful as a car crash and
midway through the build I realized I
had forgot to install the 950 pro into
the m2 slot behind the motherboard
fortunately the case has a huge CPU
cutout where I was able to mount the
drive without undoing the cables and
motherboard easily saving me half an
hour of build time something to bear in
mind is that the PCI riser card should
be installed before the CPU cooler and
memory if you hope to thread all three
of the mounting screws I ended up only
mounting two of the screws because I
refused to reinstall the CPU cooler so
this rig should be falling apart and
minute now overall this was a
challenging build given the small form
factor but the end result certainly
makes it all worthwhile
make sure to stay tuned for part two of
this video where I test thermals
acoustics and graining performance until
then let me know what you guys think of
this rig in the comments below and don't
forget to toss me a like on this video
if you enjoyed it

new extra-soft CPU cooler shirts which
are rocking a brand new material and
feature next-level hyper-threading also
