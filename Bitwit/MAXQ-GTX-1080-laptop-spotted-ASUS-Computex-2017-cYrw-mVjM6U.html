to you by be quiet cable mod verda gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info we were at the
a2 suits now checking out all the cool
fun stuff they've got on display and I
was walking by here with the good ol
Gary and awesome representatives here at
a juice and he showed me this first I
like show me the best thing you have and
he brought me to this X 399 motherboard
yes that's right X 399 you can take a
look at quite a few X 299 boards on the
Intel side this year at Computex so far
but this is the first X 399 AMD board
that we've seen from anyone here at the
event the rog venus extreme art really
be supporting AMD's really really really
highly anticipated the Red River which
is going to be a ridiculous ridiculous
multi-core in thread CPU actually you
can see that they've actually opted for
a ball grid array or BGA in terms of
their socket it's gonna be socket tr4 I
believe is the name of it and it's
actually comprised you can see that it's
really long it's not exactly perfectly
square so it's basically just going to
be two CPUs the two dies fuse together
on one motherboard I mean there's
basically reminiscent of a server board
for example but it's got this sort of
gaming swagger to it if you will
RGB LEDs right up here and on the
chipset itself we've got plenty of PCIe
slots for I'm not going to give away how
many PJ lanes were actually going to be
getting on on this particular platform
that is still under NDA but rest assured
it will be a lot oh wait let me sum of
the powers of YP saw boom do it do it
honey
beautiful alright now we can see so what
other thing is apart from the a Tim
cloth you've also got a ninth one that's
going to be for an expansion a sort of
an expansion card or I should just say a
little PCB that will go in here for the
dim to support supporting up to 2 mq SSD
which is pretty handy also frees up a
little bit more space on the TPP for
other fun stuff like the PCIe slots and
things like that obviously you're going
to get support here for the digital RGB
addressable RGB strips
straight on the motherboard as well as
this included 10 Gigabit Ethernet
expansion card so that's really nice and
the last tidbit of information that I
can reveal about this board today is
that it will be sporting 802 11 ad Wi-Fi
that's right a deism dog not AC is going
to be a faster standard that should
theoretically give you a bit more
bandwidth on the wireless connection
moving on to the Intel x2 99 stuff here
we have the rog rampage 6 extreme which
does look very extreme indeed I actually
had Wi-Fi South turn the light off just
so we can see the unique RGB effect that
we've got here
sort of a translucent effect going
across the little field here the shield
is covering just all the all the little
gaps between the the four PCIe gen3 flop
tips that looks very nice it's
transitioning between the colors
relatively smoothly and the sidebar
you're going to light a light bar on the
side right there which is probably one
of the best implementations I've seen on
a motherboard another lighting zones
here right in the middle Republic of
gamers so fair enough fair enough and
then one last lighting zone up here in
the top left corner by your rear i/o a
nice big ole X to our 2066 socket and
just as we saw with the X 399 board you
do get a dim dot Q slot as well so you
can connect up to 2 mq SSDs all right
guys we're take a look at the rog Zephyr
it was rockin either a gtx 1070 or GG X
1080 with NVIDIA snoo GeForce GTX 2 max
Q design you essentially lowers the TDP
quite significantly on these full
desktop graphics cards so for the 1080
you can go as low as 90 watt TDP which
you theoretically improve thermals and
battery life exactly kind of the the
ultimate combo that you want for a super
thin gaming laptop you can see it's
pretty much we've entered like
ultrabooks bin territory it's super
portable and you've got a ton of space
here this is really where the cooling
solution is probably going to be for
your GPU and your CPU we've got a 7700
HQ there's a mobile
CPU however of course full fledged
desktop GPU once again you got a very
nice keyboard here that wiping sauce is
demonstrating for us fully backlit but
these are not mechanical but they feel
really good in fact I'll there is also a
small track set on the right it's not
too big which I don't mind too much
since most gamers are probably going to
be connecting amounts anyway however
this does function also has a 10 key
number pad if you want to do some data
entry
like that the screen itself is basically
one of the centerpieces of this entire
device it's a 15.6 inch screen 1920 by
1080 resolution IPS looks absolutely
beautiful and it also supports 120 Hertz
with g-sync oh my goodness it looks
amazing I think we're playing the the
latest Mass Effect on here right now and
it just looks absolutely cool the other
thing is that it's anti glare so matte
finish even though there are a ton of
lights here at the convention you can
still see the screen perfectly fine
clear as day also one of my favorite
things about this is that the
ventilation is always kind of scary on
laptops it's not always the best and not
the most well implemented if you
actually open when you open up the the
lid here the entire laptop sort of Rises
and it kind of opens up the backplate
the entire backplate gets separated from
the unit itself and there's just a ton
more ventilation right underneath so
you're actually getting fresh intake
from the sides of the laptop as opposed
to the very bottom so if you have to be
putting this on like a softer you know
you're not not nearly as flat simulant
so you leave it on the bed for a second
or on the carpet god forbid you can rest
assured that the ventilation committee
of it's better this year you're not
taking it from the very bottom very very
cool stuff here as far as pricing and
availability you can expect one of these
to ship in the next coming months and
pricing is obviously going to depend on
the tier of hardware package you get you
can either get a GTX 1080 with the 512
gig SSD for around 20 $6.99 I believe
with the price and the gtx 1070 option
with a 256 gig SSD is going to be a
couple hundred bucks left stay tuned for
this thing it's going to be awesome once
against the ROG separate alright guys
using some of the stuff you've seen so
far has been pretty impressive here at
the a tooth booth right here we have the
next generation of revolutionary
external graphics cards just look at how
small and tiny this amazing piece of
I've just been informed that this is
actually a 4k blu-ray player with RGB
lighting no less so forgive me for that
mistake this is a revolutionary graphics
card that you should all be very
interested in but I don't think I don't
think we can top RGB blu-ray player for
today so I'm just going to call it for
this video guys thanks to my sponsors
be quiet verdaguer table mod and EVGA
for making this trip possible
be sure to toss me a like on this video
if you enjoyed it guys to check out the

have a good one getting the hell out of
