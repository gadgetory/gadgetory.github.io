global system of interconnected computer
networks known as the internet chances
are you've already heard about the
recent Comcast fiasco ah which one of
course
allow me to specify a lady called the
company to cancel her internet service
and was greeted by the worst customer
service rep of all time after 10 minutes
of running around in circles with him
she handed the phone off to her husband
who then proceeded to record the rest of
the conversation and post the audio clip
online thanks Internet during the
painfully frustrating 8 minute clip the
common collective customer requests over
and over that his service be cancelled
only to be met with the condescending
tone of a heated Comcast rep who demands
to know why understand why you can't
just disconnect us after the call went
viral a redditor who was verified as an
ex-con cast employee of nine years
revealed that if comcast reps don't
retain at least 75% of their customers
their commission payout drops to zero
maybe that's why this phone call sounded
less like good customer service and more
like don't leave if I need to eat gosh
must be good times being a Comcast
employee
happy Anniversary Margaret I made you
this cup of instant noodles that I
seasoned with my tears
if that's the way Comcast reps are
compensated it's likely this little
nightmare wasn't just a one-time fluke
but that it happens all the time
personally I think ISP reps should be
the ones greeted with that automated
message that says this call may be
monitored or recorded to show the world
you're an asshole
well we already knew that but at least
this time we'll have the proof now these
have been driving in your ordinary car
when a Tesla Model S rolls by and you're
like I hate you civic I hate you well
Tesla announced this week that they're
modestly priced model 3 vehicle will be
available for pre-order come 2015 so
your days of driving that crappy car may
soon be so far behind you you'll be able
to see it in your rear-view mirror of
your new Tesla the name Model 3 was
actually the result of a legal matter
with Ford who threatened to sue Tesla
for trademarking the intended name model
II because clearly there are no other
letters in the alphabet Tesla CEO Elon
Musk claims the new ride will have a
200-mile range on a single charge and
will include a free bumper sticker that
says screw the environment
I'm driving this car to be a badass
images of the model three have yet to be
released but Tesla claims the car will
be 20% smaller than the Model S so we
can expect it to look something like
this haha these photos of unreleased
hardware awesome leaked NSA documents
awesomely controversial but still
awesome leaked strategy days before 10
million dollar gaming tournament not
awesome well I guess it depends which
team you asked but overall not cool this
was the unfortunate luck that fell onto
team DK just days before the
International dota 2 championship with a
prize pool totaling over 10 million
Della's the team had locked themselves
into a planning room to discuss their
tactics for the tournaments but a
journalist from Chinese website game
Feist slipped into the room and
proceeded to record the team's entire
strategy before uploading it to a
Chinese video site
what's more absurd to me than the
journalists audacity to do such a thing
is the fact that an entire team of
professional gamers didn't notice the
random Chinese dude in the corner of the
room was team DK so wrapped up in their
planet they didn't see him or did they
just brush him off hey who's that
Chinese guy filming us he's got a badge
on I think his name's media man by the
time the team's coach demanded the video
be taken down it had already spread to
other sites like YouTube game 5 was
quick to publish a letter apologizing
for the assholey of their asshole
journalists the letter translated into
perfect English states without further
permission from valve we will not enter
players rooms to conduct any kind of
film work now that they've promised no
more kind of film work will take place
game 5 will conduct their future film
work pissed off for Team DK and dota 2
fans everywhere we can only hope that's
a promise all right guys thank you so
much for watching this video feel free
to leave your thoughts and comments in
the section below and let me know what
changes or improvements you'd like to
see in future episodes thank you all so
much once again for watching and
Calvin's Oz news until next time I'll
see you in the next video what's more
absurd to me what's more absurd to me
than the fact that a little hate
you Civic Sorry Sorry your family has a
civic Aaron I just picked one
arbitrarily I didn't mean to single
anyone's car out sweating so much find a
super power
it would be to never sweat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
