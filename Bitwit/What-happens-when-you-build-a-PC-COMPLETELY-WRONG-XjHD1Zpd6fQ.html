on guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well I just want to
start this video off by saying I am
truly sorry for the actions of my
identical twin brother Lyle who came in
here unbeknownst to me in the Milan
studio when I was gone and built this
travesty of a system decided to film it
and upload the video in its entirety to
my YouTube channel I am sorry I had no
idea that this happened until after the
fact
and trust me I had some very strong
words with Lyle
as soon as I found out but I thought at
the very least I could make light of a
bad situation by learning from all of
the mistakes he's made when assembling
this rig so today what we're gonna do is
compare the gaining performance of the
system that he's built in its current
state against an identical one using all
the same hardware that I've reconfigured
and installed everything properly just
to see what kind of performance drop off
if any you would incur from building a
system like this now before we dive into
the benchmarks I want to quickly point
out all of the things that Lyle has done
incorrectly here there's quite a few of
them so for starters we have our case
fans completely still the system is
powered on mind you and yet we have to
120s the front a 140 at the back and a
200 millimeter up top that are not
plugged in so that's a lot of airflow
we're missing out on
that's not reaching our main components
and we'll actually be able to validate
soon enough what kind of thermal costs
that costs additionally we have a CPU
cooler with a fan mounted on the left
side of the fin stack moving air towards
the front of the case which seems a bit
backwards to me if it were me I'd have
the fan on the opposite side pushing air
through the radiator towards the back of
the case so we can get ejected out with
the help of this fan assuming it was
plugged in look at this only one of our
memory sticks is mounted in the proper
slot that's a 50% Lyle
you know what that is and
we also have a very nice MSI GTX 1080
gaming excursion Utley mounted into an X
4 slot so it's only receiving four PCIe
lanes which if there's gonna be anything
I think that tanks gaming performance
with this system it's gonna be that and
honestly I don't think there'd be as
much concern if this was flooded in the
x8 slot because there's typically very
little drop-off going from 16 X to 8x
but I think 4 X were tipping the scales
at that point and we'll see exactly what
kind of damage that does we have a power
supply that's mounted upside down
depending on who you ask
with the fan up top here which some
people claim is going to compete for
airflow with your graphics card
especially one that's mounted so closely
together I think this might be a
non-issue once we mount the GPU up to
the 16x slot so maybe this might be one
area where Lyle gets off easy but rest
assured we'll hold him accountable for
everything else like these front panel
connectors that are just sort of hanging
out of our case like entrails absolutely
disgusting he could have at least put
them behind the motherboard tray if he
wasn't gonna plug him in what a pig and
finally we have an SSD that's just
hanging out of a cable grommet not sure
what the thought process was there Lyle
did you miss the 1 2 3 4 SSD trike right
in front of you come on dude this is
unacceptable and quite frankly I can't
look at the system a moment longer so
let's just go ahead and redo everything
he's done wrong which is everything and
give this thing a makeover all right
guys this is what a proper system should
look like Lyle take notes we got our GPU
in the proper x16 slot or CPU coolers
facing the right way our case fans are
spinning for the love of God although
this one is kind of picking up on my mic
right now so I'm gonna unplug it hey
don't mind me rest assured I tested it
with the fan spinning up for our
benchmarks but what I want to say here
is that not only does this clean up the
overall look of our system especially
after tidying up the cable management
but in theory making these changes
should drop our temperatures on our 1700
I rise in 7 1700 in our GT X 1080 while
also boosting our gaming performance in
terms of frame rates so I think it's
time to validate these claims with
the benchmarks that I run at 1920 by
1080 on Windows 10 64 bit using the
latest Google drivers from Nvidia ladies
and gentlemen without further ado here
are the benchmarks while the benchmarks
have spoken and what they've said is
that this new and improved system
outperforms the old one in pretty much
every area starting with the graphics
card I mean simply swapping it from the
x4 slot where it was just being choked
for data into the x16 slot we saw a
tremendous 48 percent uplift in average
frame rates and that was combining all
the data from our five different tests
that's insane that's really really
insane almost to the point where it felt
like I was gaining on two different
systems because this new one was so much
more visibly smooth in every sense that
being said I got to give the old crappy
system some credit it was still very
playable but the frame rate difference
is just so vast that it really is kind
of night and day additionally all the
other changes that we made in the system
have less of an impact on frame rates
directly and more to do with thermals I
would say particularly for our risin 7
1,700 here we actually dropped 5 degrees
going from 42 to 37 which isn't a whole
lot granted this is a 65 watt TDP chip
in the first place so it's not going to
get very hot from the get-go and then
for degrees we've dropped off of our
graphics card going from 72 to 68 now I
was actually expecting much larger
thermal Delta here and I think one of
the reasons apart from again 65 watt TDP
chip that we're seeing this is because
the case that we're dealing with is so
cavernous there's a lot of breathing
room inside of the trooper as is and
also the fact that we get that nice
unimpeded front mesh grille means that
we actually have room for passive
airflow here which definitely helps out
our components evidently so I think what
this is all chucking up to is that the
moral of the story today is quite simple
but important and that is if you're
gonna do something do it right don't be
like Lyell and don't just plug and chug
things in arbitrarily read the manual
don't be afraid of the manual try to
swallow your pride you know when it
comes to building your PC and stuff like
that and always remember that just
because something fits doesn't mean it
should go there that's what she said
cutting things off right there ladies
and gentlemen thank you so much for
tuning in let me know in the comments if
your system at home looks anything like
this one or if there's certain things
that you've mounted you know in an
unorthodox or unconventional way for
whatever reason and and how that's been
working out for you I'd love to hear all
about it down below
apart from that guys cost like on the
video if you enjoyed it you can also get
subscribed to the channel so you don't
miss any more of our tech stuff coming
at you really soon you can also follow
us on a floatplane for 3 bucks a month
if you want to catch our videos a week
early without ads I'll put a link for
that in the video description
apart from that guys thank you so much
for tuning in have a good one and I'll
see you all in the next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
