though sporadic it comes in
spits and firts vomits birds and pits
and farts Fitz Fitz and spurts I think
this the Terramax is true that's a I
think it spits and farts like not a
completely wrong in measurements I
realized as I was about to say that's
like I don't have these words to say but
I just I just plowed ahead
you still okay you're still strong on

video you cheapskates yeah nothing in
this world is for free it's not even
gonna be out for like a couple more days
so you guys will have to you guys can
guess send send me guesses if you want
or that's why that's why I gotta get on
float plane like it's already a float
plane just pay me that's one of my
babies name pay up or there's money
there is exchange for information there
is a like a way that people could figure
it out goods available but I don't they
could bribe I doubt you're right I doubt
anyone yeah you could bribe pal just
fake how money there's another way yeah
I don't want to give anything more than
that but I could see somebody figuring
it out right
I mean it's 2019 based on information
that's that's up she probably already
has a Facebook account
you know just in this day and age oh
yeah can't you can't escape the internet
the achieve even created for herself
yeah they're tracking her it was
automatically LoJack and everything all
right well uh on that very joyous note I
guess we can jump into the show right
before we whore ourselves out a little
bit yeah but wait tech is my store you
can buy my brand-new screw with
confidence shirt which has been flying
off the shelves oh yeah sound like
hotcakes we just restock some so they're
fresh off the press 22 bucks a pop you
know shipping can be a little pricey so
I suggest buying many objects yeah by
many fans way that way maximize the more
you buy the more you save Paul also has
this
or Paul's heart net and captive
thumbscrew shirt still still there still
going strong captive thumbscrew also
available in mug form takes on many
shapes want to point that out yeah
choose yours choose your form factor of
preference a lot of other things on on
both of our stories so I like the
captive thumbscrew it very lovable
lovable thumbs just bored and there what
else yeah well bad for the guy alright
but let's let's dive into some tech news
here we've I've got three segments
they're like men live near your yeah the
thing you made oh yeah yeah I guess you
could set that up while I ramble about
tech news yeah because we're not getting
there just yet but this is just a
generic tech news I only have three
articles in this little mini segment
today they're just kind of bangers
they're bangers the big headlines that
were just across multiple sites bangers
and mash
starting with a.m. be announcing their
next horizon gaming event at e3 I'm sure
most you guys have already heard about
this there's not much to go on here this
this article in particular is from WCF
tech but AMD did announce that they're
gonna be hosting their own event at e3
on June 10th at 3:00 p.m. Pacific
Daylight Time with a company
accompanying livestream so if you can't
be there in person you can always catch
it online it's gonna be hosted by the
game awards creator Geoff Keighley or
Kylie I have no idea how to pronounce
his last name I don't really care but
Lisa sue will be presenting the majority
of the presentation and revealing some
juicy details about their upcoming plans
for 2019 what exactly we can't say for
sure but a lot of people are speculating
that this is gonna be a soft launch for
the the na'vi GPU did you say lisa sue
lisa sue it's a nice name not her name
yeah yeah yeah just say that's a nice
name
it is a nice name it's like a female
name two syllables and then a middle
name a single syllable yeah it's great
it's great formula for a girl's name
it's true all right so the Nabi Nabi GPU
soft-launched is is very highly
speculated here to be the the talking
point the main talking point of the
event why because we already kind of
know that AMD is going to be talking
about risin 3000 family
you copy to copy it under here you know
I might not have copied you out there I
might have just handed you the thumb
drive without ever oh I can put it on
here so yeah this is pretty interesting
because we already know the third gen
rise and stuff is gonna be talked about
and unveiled at Computex most likely
which only leaves navi to be the the
talking point of discussion for e3 and
they looked pretty cool I hope they
don't just announce the the newly leaked
rx 600 series of GPUs which is likely to
just be a rebrand or a refresh and some
capacity that would not be very exciting
if that was the big secret they were
holding on to for III but we're gonna
talk about the rx 600 series in more
detail later on my half of the show so
stick around for that
so I'm guessing Navi that seems like the
most logical thing if you're if you
don't care about discrete GPUs in any
sense and shame on you but AMD will also
be covering a slew of other topics
including next-gen console technology
what their plans are for the next wave
of PlayStation and Xbox consoles I'm
sure potential ray-tracing discussion
how that's going to work and be
integrated onto a home gaming platform
but we'll see so just a brief
announcement they're good things to come
everyone get excited but not too excited
time for a disappointment there I'm
super excited you should be for the most
part with a grain of salt next up we
have an article from Engadget about
Facebook's FTC punishment that could
involve 20 years of oversight as we all
know Facebook has been on the on the
burner you know they're under fire as of
late it had been for a while ever since
the whole Cambridge analytic a scandal
last year where they were caught
harvesting the data of 87 million people
without their permission this was a huge
deal remember
Zuckerberg even went who is he talking
in front of court of court of white
people what are they called
he was answering a bunch of questions
they were interrogating him more or less
a Senate or House Oversight Committee
could have been them could have been one
of those yeah and it's this huge deal
because Facebook is obviously a tech
giant they have a lot of people's
information and if they're harvesting
the data and selling it back to other
companies sharing it with other third
parties without people's consent that's
it's a big deal so FTC is getting ready
to negotiate the company's multi-billion
dollar penalty for these security
failures and it could it could actually
set a world record
I think the second right now the the
current record for fines owed to the FTC
was twenty two and a half million
dollars paid by Google back in 2012
Facebook's looking at paying potentially
up to five billion dollars which would
blow that record away which is also
insane so it could also result in
Facebook having to carry out third party
conduct audits every two years for the
next 20 years to ensure that they're
within compliance with these FTC rules
and regulations so it's it's not it's
not looking good it's not looking great
for Facebook but never really like
Facebook much anyway
I don't I don't I don't put my personal
unfamiliar face book I only have it so I
can know people's birthdays even people
I care about I don't know their
birthdays just if you just look up their
birthdays put it on like a calendar like
you know too late Google Calendar or an
online one I don't care about the
birthdays of that piece okay I care
about their birthdays enough to keep my
facebook profile but not enough to
actually jot them down on a different
medium I do have my facebook I deleted
my facebook account I had to make a new
one to to cover to be able to handle
with my pulse Hardware Facebook uh-huh
which which has nothing posted to its
yeah I don't post a my my business one
either yeah is there a way that you can
pause your account like basically make
it private so that no one can see it
it's like you don't exist on there but
then you could always fire it back up
later if you want to or I don't even
know I've never tried I don't know okay
like that began I'm not the prayer I was
all I looked for was the nuclear option
to completely completely delete well
it's not destruct it makes you wait a
month what yeah what I tell because what
they're expecting is that you'll have
this impulse at this draw to go back
second basically you like hit delete I'm
like they're like you want to delete
everything yeah delete everything and
then all right you've got a month
don't login don't look at Facebook for
one month and then your account will be
deleted that's the only way they do it
and they're expecting like you know a
week or two into it
Oh what if somebody posts something
about me or like said stupid shit or
whatever the fuck people do on Facebook
by the way did you did the cursing
warning right yeah I did we did now we
case on the show exhibit anyway yeah
people chatter saying you can disable
your account okay disabled okay that's
what I was thinking now that's a better
it's better than crippling your account
disabled and we know they're just using
some bullshit marketing tactic it's like
if you put a countdown timer on
something that they already want to get
rid of they'll see the countdown timer
and psychologically they'll want it back
because it's it's filled now all of a
sudden it feels like it's your choice
it feels like it's no longer in their
hands it feels like it wasn't even their
choice to delete their count the first
place
it's like Facebook's taking it away from
them and then there's a countdown timer
and you got act now it's a total mind
fuckery at Facebook stealing do you know
I'm proud of you Paul
thank you sticking to your guns as a
father I can that motherly was I can now
preface any statement with you know as a
father it lends more weight way more
street cred more yeah to what I'm saying
I just wanted to point that out you know
I'll be I'll be tactful using that
little your opening statement when Arian
you know caught drinking and driving and
thrown in jail with a DUI after killing
two pedestrians but you know as a father
they get up there all wasted and it was
sick Oh
considered thoroughly before having that
that fireball went on that bender all
right so let's let's talk about our next
story we
just as cheery Nvidia is getting sued oh
good oh boy I mean that good it's a
doozy not good if your Nvidia they're
getting sued for copyright infringement
of all things
that's this patent Oh patent and rid
same same old thing patent infringement
not be right no I think that's the same
no okay maybe not I don't know why I put
copyright infringement it was it was
9:00 a.m. when I took notes I was stolen
I mean infringement if you say the word
infringement
yeah which word goes with this sure
probably you think copyright but no yeah
you're definitely right because it is
about five patents that are in question
and this is from a company called X
Perry Corp do you know this company and
how to pronounce its name x perry click
X Perry Corp I'm just gonna say X Perry
they're a company that licenses IPS for
for broadcast PE RI yeah or Sperry those
companies that they like looked for a
word that not hadn't been made a company
yet go do this in search of the next
people think exes are cool yeah and no
one ever knows how to pronounce it right
though it makes no fanatical sense so
fucking stupid in work they must I saw
this fucking stupid Corp yeah I think
they're all cool and edgy stupid name
we're having a nonsensical name I'm just
kidding I don't know why I'm so
aggressive towards this this corporation
maybe they have a legitimate claim
against some video oh yeah I shouldn't
Chad said maybe it's short for
experience that's probably what they
want to imply expiry experience that's
off of that like that's how they decide
what the name should be for like
pharmaceuticals the ads you see on TV
for them and second oh yeah right it's
like depress --ax yeah take a depress X
there what an accident just know where
I'm gonna make one up in my mind
wellbutrin and that's an actual water
right yeah I'm pretty sure that isn't I
mean I've heard it before so let's be
real okay so anyway they carry a bunch
of different licenses for for a broad
range of ips
and tech like audio imaging codecs
DTS X IMAX virtual X more importantly
they license semiconductor packaging and
inner core technology IP so the
companies claiming that Nvidia is in
violation of five of their patents all
having to do
and relate to semiconductor design the
suit was filed in the US District Court
of Delaware and X Perry has large
clients like Sony LG Samsung $0.10
Alibaba so they've got a lot of big big
names under their belt they've already
won copyright and patent infringement
lawsuits against Samsung in Broadcom I'm
sorry broadband or no Broadcom that's
right yeah I should take some broad so
the fact that they've actually won these
infringement lawsuits against these huge
companies means that their patents are
very very legally sound are well
protected and they actually hold some
some ground so it also it also tells us
that their claims and complaints against
Nvidia are most likely legitimate all
they would have to do in a court of law
is prove that Nvidia is actually using
their IP no Tom's Hardware I stopped
playing the always want to play Tom I'm
sick of your shit damn it Tom seen
enough okay
so Nvidia might be in some trouble here
it's hard to say how much they might end
up owing or how they're going to pay off
X Perry in the court of law if they are
deemed guilty but yeah it's uh it seems
like you know I don't think it's guilty
in this type of thing I think it's
liable guilty you're guilty of IP
infringement I'm not a lawyer your guilt
Jennsen look at that jacket it's not
cruelty free at all how many cows do you
have to kill to make that guilty Oh tell
I'm really married to a vegan nobody is
gonna counter sue you for slander and
libel yeah then I will then I will be
the guilty one for impersonating the
Fashion Police
I'll plead guilty fuck it come at me bro
so um yeah Nvidia is under some heat
right now god be with them hope it
doesn't impact their graphics card
manufacturing I can't imagine it would
but we're suing we're suing your GPU
manufacturing graphics cards all geforce
cards triple in price that's okay
they're already triple the normal rate
they should be
how it works all right so that's news
those are the three banger headlines for
today let's move on to my second
revolutionary segment this is the
world's first time the world's first
time have ever shown this segment called
world's first not face-off that's okay
it's cuz I didn't put put the actual
lower thirds that I made minutes before
the show started onto the flash drives
Paul now has we have a 2015 recap lower
three we used to be so on top of it
we've been doing the show since 2015
yeah oh my god geez we need to quit
we're washed up with Fall Festival yeah
okay so I'm just gonna do it it's almost
fall well you talk about whatever stupid
thing you're gonna say yep
I'm gonna do I'm gonna go through old
old lower thirds okay that's it he's
gonna cycle through them let's just take
a trip down memory lane
like well now I'm distracted because I
want to see all the lower thirds we've
had in the past we can't do that you
know really good to follow your script
that you made because you well now well
now it's like you've created a third a
third segment off of this like a branch
off segment where it's like you distract
the host while they try to tell a story
that actually be funny I hope we don't
have you bang
excuse me cryptocurrency see you back no
that'd be bad Bitcoin currency just
jumped from six grand to eight grand it
did yeah just and I'm like oh no I feel
conflicted you shouldn't put all those
all those those bench test test benches
away grandad jumped up recently I mean
it was lingering around five grand
okay anyway sorry no I'm against right
now I'm like all right how do I make
money I'm even more distracted now all
right so world's first is a segment
about companies who come out with
products that they deem to be the
world's first something and that's why
if you if you saw the lower thirds you
would see that world's first is put in
quotations because some of these are
have more legitimate claims to being
world's first than others
what what else can you tell us about the
Lord returns it means that people can
see there was a little picture there was
a little there was a little mean-faced
next to us first I think I have it up
here you can totally see it there it is
yeah
a little mean guide that much like ya
writes the best lower thirds ever it is
I mean it's it's like Gloria really
sexist too bad you look good see it it's
like Marsellus Wallace's suitcase you
never get to see what's really in there
but it's glorious that's called the
MacGuffin MacGuffin stuff all right so
the first article here is from
overclocked 3d net it's about a soos
making the world's first monitor to
feature concurrent motion blur reduction
and adaptive sync all in one package
concurrent motion blur reduction yeah so
basically simultaneously the monitor
supports extreme low motion blur and
concurrent motion blur reduction and
detective sing and adaptive sink which
asus is calling extreme low motion blur
sync or al mbc remember i'm gonna press
it's a little black it's LM sink Elm
sink so typically you could only have
one or the other because LM be low
motion motion blur requires strobing
backlight which is really difficult to
sort of sync up with a panel that has
adaptive refresh rate so asus has done
it with their new tough v g3 2 BQ
display just another tough series
monitor that's also kind of I don't know
if they've had a monitor in their tough
series before I don't think so
this looks like an rog swift panel for
all intensive purposes but you know
tough branding even though it's nowhere
else up to be found on the actual
monitor at least from what I can see in
this picture it's what's on the screen
though so yep that's all the monitor can
display is this image yeah no that's
that sure they're cleaning it to be an
issue is exclusive you know for now I'm
sure at some point other manufacturers
will have this on their panels too but
issue seems to be that it seems to have
the first pick of the litter and the
panel did be used the new tech the panel
that W is the new text is sporting a 32
inch screen 1440p v
a technology with HDR support not sure
what what the rating is its HDR 400
that's it's pretty pointless and a 144
Hertz refresh rate so it's gonna be fast
have pretty good color reproduction
because it's VA and yeah you get LMB
sync Elm sync to his house so you get
you know I guess I guess that would be
free sync more or less yes and extreme
low and motion blur they just say
adaptive sync no because you can use it
within video too
I know they totally like it's like they
took it away from AMD freesync was very
much an AMD thing and they like not just
its open-source today he doesn't own it
screw him
you know works for D fourth cards just
as well everyone go by G fourth card no
pricing or availability on the panel
just yet
I guess we'll keep our eyes out for it
and that's all for that let's move on to
our next article from hexxus lenovo has
previewed the world's first foldable pc
Hey whoa it's actually a laptop but hold
on Kyle the most part all laptops
foldable that's right it's a screen it's
a dual screen that's foldable it's a
foldable screen that they announce that
they're accelerate 19 event in Florida
this week and it's a part of the premium
ThinkPad x1 family slated for a 2020
launch it's not a phone this is a quote
from Lenovo not a tablet or familiar
hybrid this is a full-fledged laptop
with a foldable screen thanks for
clearing that up Lenovo comes with a
sailboat
we've no idea just looking at the
picture just what they're watching uh
they also went on to say that this will
no way compromise productivity and
reliability which could very well be
famous last words because as far as I
could tell this thing has no physical
keyboard and I don't know how organ amah
core practical this is gonna be as a
laptop replacement world bends to you if
you've got a touch has I've ever been a
thing a touch a screen touch keyboard
I've seen the laser ones where it's like
a little laser projection those are
garbage I've seen you know you obviously
type with your phone and you're in your
thumbs that's a different thing
you ever seen like typing on a screen
with your like a full QWERTY keyboard on
a screen I'm pretty sure yes that's
that's been done before remember you
know like laptops that they doesn't have
a screen on the top and the screen
screen on the bottom I wonder how well
that did I can't imagine that it was
talking about living so beer I think so
I don't know that this seems super
gimmicky to me I feel like you know it
probably has the power of a laptop but I
don't think that it's gonna be as
productive or practical as one simply
because the the keyboard in situation
and yeah okay you could carry your own
keyboard around with you your own
wireless you know Bluetooth keyboard but
that's not practical either you know
it's beauty the laptop so all in one so
it's gonna have a 2k OLED panel with the
touch and stylus it seems like a
glorified tablet to me 13.3 inch
diagonal screen when it's fully open and
you get a nine point six inch screen
when it's folded so the you know one
half of the other will be nine point six
inches diagonal from corner to corner
promising all-day battery life yada yada
yada
they had tablet booked and productivity
modes that were shown off it can also
easily dock into a multi-monitor setup
for work purposes for example that's a
cost there's no there's no mentioned
cost David I would imagine two grand
which is ridiculous sure why not just
because it's a new feature that isn't
even that useful given how the galaxy
folds recently yeah exactly and that I I
certainly hope they do better right with
the fold and their screen there's a lot
of issues that we were talking about in
a previous episode of this show on why
foldable screens prone to so many issues
you know a lot of dead pixel potential
dust can get underneath the part of the
screen that's moving up and down at the
fold on during this bump at the spine a
lot of other things so we'll see how it
does I consider all folding screens
right now as guinea pigs and it's not
necessarily a technology I'd be a proud
early adopter of till they work the
kinks out and then our last world's
first product for today
is the HP omen x2s promising to be or
alleging to be the world's first dual
screen gaming laptop ah hold on a second
to screen down here didn't we see we see
the razor razor one of the razor blades
something's I mean the the razor the
razor get it get everyone's attention at
Computex them or was that CES CSEE yes I
think the razor triple monitor laptop
it's sort of the V Valerie Project
Valerie Project Valerie Valkyrie
Valkyrie no Valentino that Valentine
Valentine oh I'd like that project
vasectomy yeah at any rate this is
claiming that you know well hey we're
the first one to actually come to market
with a dual screen gaming laptop all
right
so I guess that does that does count for
something it was announced today at the
HP gaming festival in Beijing and HP
claims that a second six inch
touchscreen embedded above the keyboard
deck shakes the foundation of what's
expected of a gaming laptop with
tremendous multitasking capabilities for
various activities and support with
dedicated hotkeys shakes the foundation
oh okay so HP is claiming some I don't
know some really bold claims here
they're saying I don't know where they
got these numbers 82% to PC gamers use
mobile phones for messaging during
gaming sessions I don't think that's
true but okay 61% listen to music while
they game it's probably more believable
but that still seems kind of high 49
percent watch game related live streams
video content and browse the web that I
think is the most believable of the
three but they're saying that all of
this can be done with this little 6 inch
companion screen that's the bottom of
the monitor or at the bottom of the
laptop and you can also do some some
nifty things like real time cut and
magnify so if you wanted to take let's
say the mini-map of you're playing a
racing game you want to take the
mini-map and blow it up and put that on
the screen below you can do that just
real time on the fly which i think is
pretty useful actually okay have some
applications there so I feel
this is part gimmicky part actually
getting somewhere close to being
innovative but the main screen is 15.6
inch 6 inches at 1080p with 144 Hertz or
240 Hertz max refresh you can kind of
configure it to your to your needs or
you can swap it out for a 4k HDR 460
Hertz panel which I don't think would be
a good idea but that's just me you can
also choose from an Intel ninth gen core
processor up to an 8 core core i9 and up
to an RT X 20 80 max Q so that's some
pretty beefy specs there as well 20
millimeter thick body with all that
Hardware in there even with a Mac that
max Q I mean r-tx 2080 core I know it's
gonna get it's gonna get pretty hot so
how does HP plan to tackle heat and
thermals in particular in a 20
millimeter thick body all things
considered well I'm glad you asked Paul
they're using thermal Grizzly's
conductive nuts
liquid metal compound obviously or it's
often advertised I believe on gamers
Nexus his channel I know they've done
some ads with thermal grizzly in the
past and they're conducted not stuff so
you know if it's Steve approved I prove
it to ya this is good enough for me
Steve's tested it surely he has tested
barrels and barrels of this stuff so
that's probably where they got the idea
they're the HP reps for watching gamers
next week this guy really loves his
conducting not maybe we should just
stick this in our laptop and just hike
the price up 20% that sounds like a
great idea check so HP's claiming 20%
FPS uplift over traditional thermal
interface material in games like apex
legends that's crazy
oh well nearly a 30% gaming performance
uplift just from switching to liquid
metal you never know I'm sure I'm sure
it'll be tested what I'm sure they'll be
tested I yeah it seems like a bold claim
I mean if it's really lowering
temperatures that much I mean again you
need to see the full testing conditions
to really say I mean this is very very
there's nothing that we're going off of
here they haven't given any other
information this is just a bottom line
statement that could be skewed in any
way
take that with a grain of salt and be
really interested to test that claim
though because it is so bull the omen
x2s is expected in the UK
starting July at 20 499 great British
pounds that's probably like what around
3 grand u.s. or something like that
$24.99 yeah I'm just shooting in the
dark but that's that's what that model
starts at so it just goes up from there
three thousand two hundred and twenty
seven dollars okay yeah almost thirty
two hundred bucks or a little over 3,200
bucks u.s. pretty penny
pretty pretty penny it's for the
one-percenters out there but that
concludes world's first that was the
world's first world's first things first
absolutely fall and then we can go to
not the world's first segment of leaks
leaks I believe we have that lower
thirds yes we do a lower third yes we do
oh because so beauty run a tight ship
around here we do you know the only the
only lower thirds that out does that one
sadly is the BT running a tight ship how
about one of those beers oh yeah you
you're a new father you could use it no
ma'am you know I don't think I can't
remember the last time you finished a
beer before I did and suddenly you
become a dad and now you're back things
to talk about
even still even on my half I'm always
checking up wait open this beer with my
Paul sorry rare bottle opener
available in my stores it's so efficient
it even works for your friends beer too
yes
all right so these you can use it at
least 20 times it's like the knife from
Resident Evil 2 yeah to use it three
times in the shadows
alright let's move on to leaks this is
the AMD edition of leaks because all the
leaks today involving and be exciting
isn't that coincidental mm-hmm it sure
is suspicious you might even say I know
I feel like these are all coordinated
leaks planned attacks on our psyche
they're messing with our minds but let's
see whoa
we'll try it out let me kind of fun to
determine was this a legitimate leak or
was this an intentional slip well we can
tell people oh we can tell if you can
let we can let them know what's true and
what's not
we will they are the voice of truth and
reason so this articles from overclock
32.3 DV net and it involves Rison third
gen 16 core engineering sample having
its details leaked all over the juicy
web thanks to our good friend who we
have no idea who he is come up a sec the
map attacked a map a sec very well known
for his leaks on the internet when it
comes to these matters he tweets him he
revealed he revealed specs of his n 216
core him right here that's hot blood
yeah I like to shake his hand be like
thanks for the leaks peace you leak on
me anytime you want tongue I would if
that's his real name
tum tum Peppa sec I don't see any way
could be otherwise tiny Tom Logan
alright so what well is this an
engineering sample 16 core he discovered
that it has a base in boost clock of 3.3
and 4.2 gigahertz respectively now this
is an engineering sample so not
indicative necessarily of the final
specs out of the box for retail but it's
a step in the right direction it gives
us a little hint at what these chips are
capable of now the hike or count of a 16
core chip on the aam 4 platform means we
have actually more concern now for the
power circuitry capabilities of lower
end a m4 motherboards it's kind of one
of the trade-offs of having you know
this really Universal platform that is
am for that that AMD is created for us
is that you've got all kinds of boards
you've got high-end flagship mid-range
and then like the bare bones basic you
know really crappy low-end vrm power
delivery boards and so to keep AMD's
promise they actually have to make these
16 core chips able to run at least
somewhat decently and and according to
spec of whatever's listed them on the
box so if they say it's going turbo to
4.2 it better taper at a 4.2 on even the
shittiest you know $60 am for board yeah
so that means that they potentially have
to lower the clock speed out of the box
just to you know to the lowest common
denominator that also also that also
indicates that we might be able to see
higher clock speeds from the more
mid-range core count CPUs so like an 8
core or 12 thread or I'm sorry 8 core 12
core rising 3000 series chip you might
actually see higher out-of-the-box
clocks than the 16 core for example so
those are gonna be particularly better
when it comes to single threaded
performance and the more multi-threaded
focused users are lot more likely to opt
for something like 16 core chip this is
all just speculation of course and
assuming that uh mapa SEC isn't pulling
our leg or anything but yeah it makes
sense when you when you have to you know
keep in mind that the TDP has to be
manageable for the multitude of a.m. for
boards out there the article also notes
a good point here that thread Ripper for
example doesn't really have to worry
about this as much because they don't
have this tight power of power
requirements every board is seemingly
over engineered in a way they're all
very expensive you can't find like a
super cheap budget or entry-level
threader per board x3 nine board so I
guess that's a bit of a trade-off there
um let's see that's pretty much all I
summarized that really quickly but
efficiently that was good
alright any any comments their fault
moving on is this the first like 16 core
I mean I know you've seen some Zen Zen
to rise and 3000 series stuff popping up
obviously this is the first one that's
been like 16 16 core yeah right that's
good
which you know we've all kind of a
assume a lot of people have been
expecting because yeah this if you look
at this this is the chip lit with 8
cores on it and there's a spot right
here where it seems like they put the
space for another one yeah it'd be silly
if they just left a space untapped yeah
oh it would also not be a sensible chip
design because if you're talking about
keeping things cool why would you offset
the main CPU die in a weird spot where
you know you might not necessarily get
as good coverage from the thermal paste
and stuff like that yes it doesn't that
point doesn't make less
there's a good point um all right let's
move on to our next AMD related leak
this is from WCC F Tech master of leaks
the bio star x5 70 motherboard is leaked
out this is their GT 8 part of their
racing series supporting Rison 3000 CPUs
it's been leaked by none other than well
biostar they actually apparently
couldn't wait till copy text and they
put their flagship x5 70 a.m. for board
on their product catalog which reveals
all the details and specs for the
specific model that you see here ah it's
the black board the one that's right
friend center it's got some silver
accents on there it's probably got some
element of RGB yeah I can see it right
there 12 phase vrm four dimm slots up to
64 gigs capacity at 4000 megahertz now
this is kind of cool because it confirms
that we're gonna be able to see 4,000
speed sticks from from x5 70 a lot of
people were wondering how much how much
higher the the supported ram frequency
would be I agree with at land 3000 and
chat what's up with the fan and the
chipset heatsink yeah so that is one of
the features is the chipset on top of
the I'm sorry that the heatsink on top
of the chipset is being actively cooled
by a tiny little probably noisy fan
7-blade fan fortunately they've included
an on/off switch so you can just disable
it if you want to but wouldn't that be
worse than just having a regular
heatsink if you just wanted better
cooling because I mean the fan is taking
up space for passive cooling so if you
miss able it you have a very small
heatsink now it's only curious what kind
of tangible benefit you get from keeping
your chipset a few degrees cooler
actively cooling it with the fan right
but who knows I mean there's supposed to
be PCI Express Gen 4 and stuff like that
maybe maybe it's so fast because of this
bandwidth the chipset gets really hot
Guido Sarducci actually said that
according to build Zoid who knows
everything about everything so the fan
on the chipset heatsink is for
overheating during specific events that
are not mentioned yet so perhaps there
is some very unique use case scenarios
where
it's big that's very big it's very vague
I know what that means almost so vague
it's almost vega guido terrible often
speaks in riddles
yeah he's used the Riddler um but thanks
for that input there all right so we've
got three PCI Express 4.0 by 16 slots
and this is the generation of 4.0 PCI
Express all the x-force 570 boards are
going to feature this new spec and it's
something that even though you know aim
for boards will be backwards compatible
look at that existing a.m. for board
users will miss out on this new battle
start put this image out oh look at that
double chip look I did somebody just
take the an existing one and I copy and
occupation and paste it there I would
have put like five more on there yeah oh
you could you can fit several more
around the edges here if you should get
rid of these other little transistors
well 50 for clothes probably aren't
important yeah you should put put more
there just for decor oh look here's a
better shot yeah lots of em got two heat
sinks alright and that's that's a bio
starboard any other things to note here
pretty much the same like very similar
IO to what we've seen on X 470 what this
is such a bio star thing to do they've
made a board here where they've clearly
paid some attention to aesthetics made
stuff black they have some designs going
on with the X racing thing here and then
like Oh what about that USB 3.0 header
bus is that really the color the black
ones cost is an extra like tenth of a
cents more per board each now I just go
with the we got more of those light blue
ones lying around ready to put those on
there oh yeah surplus be completely
hopefully that's just for them yeah
that's terrible
are there any other pictures of the
board I don't think so at the very top
maybe this is just a blow-up from that
original picture oh no it's still there
yeah yeah oh god no just file star come
on come on this is why who proved that
this is why you're lumped with ECS and
in the estimation many people low blow
Paul and sorry I'm say no one deserves
to be a CS makes the ND and
the XT motherboard - I think right they
do okay they don't and we like they
don't advertise
relatedly and we like NZXT products we
do alright let's move on to our last
pretty though they're pretty are so
pretty okay our last AMD related leak is
from WCC F tech Radeon rx 600 series has
been spotted in latest drivers this was
discovered and hey you mention that you
mentioned this earlier I did
foreshadowings big old circle back baby
awesome actually planned just some noise
at the TPU forms that's his name just
some noise discovered this in the latest
drivers includes listings of two Radeon
rx 600 series cards but they appear to
be based on the polaris architecture no
new Navi
GPU arc here the RX 630 in our X 640
contained the same device ID as the
Radeon rx 500 series cards so this
potentially seems to be a rebrand ooh a
rebrand of a rebrand reprint a rebrand
of a rebrand of a rebrand of a rebrand
rebrand ception this is this is crazy
the arcs or any 580 yeah yeah it's I
mean it's it's crazy how long are they
gonna milk this out well I guess the
cards are still selling so marketing's
like yeah I keep going for it the arts
640 has the same device ID as the rx 550
X which is based on Polaris 23 XT GPU
architecture which was a revised version
of the Polaris 21 GPU that itself is
based on the Polaris 11 design the rx
630 however is a replacement of the
Radeon 540 X sporting a Polaris 23 MXL
GPU this will be the fourth Polaris
rebrand to make no mistake seems like
the rx 600 series will be aimed at OE
M's but we may see some consumer desktop
launches as well there is some
speculation here that Navi could still
make its way into the RX 600 series but
they would just be higher tiers and then
the lower tiers would just get eaten up
by Polaris base GPUs or
Navi is not going to see the light of
day when it comes to our X 600 it'll be
under a completely
different name which i think is probably
the more likely option and these will
just be not very exciting rebrand cards
so and it better not be the only thing
that they announce it freaking e3 I'll
be very disappointed if they don't talk
about Navi at all they got to give us a
crumb we got to give us something more
so yeah I think I think they've
stretched this one out long enough I
feel like the GTX 1650 was the last
hoorah for for the Radeon rx series like
the last feather in their hat be like
see we're still relevant and we're still
a good bang for the buck option but to
drag it out living more 16:50 I mean
like that might be the last time we get
really excited for BRX for the video for
the RX radeon rayon RX polaris cards
before they're before they actually get
replaced with because we were
generations because the GTX 1650 kind of
made them look good with its exactly
right once it's stupid pricing right
it's stupid performance yes exactly we
you know for that moment we kind of
forgot you know we kind of give him a
pass for being you know an older and
older GPU and they haven't really done
much in the entry-level realm in a while
but it was fine because and I actually
worked up to their benefit because
they're around for longer you can
actually have you can get really good
deals on Radeon rx cards Polaris based
cards on the second-hand market so like
yeah I did a video recently where I got
a an rx 574 like 85 bucks on eBay which
is almost half the price of a brand new
gtx 1650 but i'm rambling now getting
off-topic the point is is that i'm not
particularly thrilled about yet another
rebrand of another rebrand of another
rebrand but they often do this just so
they can throw them in OEM machines and
you know people who are looking at them
who never look at computer parts
otherwise like oh it's a higher number
so we'll we'll get that one yeah right
but yeah but that's all that's all for
my half of the show yay ladies and gents
thank you very much
don't go anywhere though because Paul
has a riveting half of the show
all lined up for you he's gonna do a
song and dance it will blow your socks
off you'll be glad we were 20 minutes
late for today's episode my half will be
passable at best thanks for watching
Kyle's half though it's more than weeks
if you do want to watch my half it's
