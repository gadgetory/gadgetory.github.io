we're we're gonna assume that we're live
so hello everyone thank you for joining
us for the first ever new live show the
Kyle and I are doing we're planning to
do this on a weekly basis we're calling
it awesome hardware because that is a
combination of my channel's name which
is Paul is awesome and Kyle's Hardware
no I think I got those spending too much
time brilliant in this room alone that's
true so we've been doing some
preparation today we were actually let's
start off let's talk let's talk about
the format read right from the get-go
because we are trying to make this a
little bit different from some of the
other shows that are out there but the
format is going to be actually two shows
kind of in one so we're gonna do the
this first half of the show which is
actually Kyle's half of the show I don't
know why I'm leading it right now this
is Kyle's half of the show I'll open
your set and then halfway through we're
gonna cut it off and we'll start it up
again and we're gonna do my half of the
show we're intending it to be about an
hour total and it might go longer than
that we're not gonna stick to that too
closely and that's gonna be kind of how
it goes and then later on if you miss it
live you should you'll be able to watch
Kyle's half on his channel and my half
on my channel and we'll probably
flip-flop it every week yeah but you you
also forgot to mention that the name of
the show is awesome hardware and not to
be confused with the awesome hardware
show that is true it is Australia pride
where the show that is a live show
called awesome Hardware right that's
correct
I feel like awesome hardware is already
long enough but that's an F introduction
we should we should get on with the
festivities yes so as we do this on
Tuesday evenings since this is the first
show ever and I don't know if I'm even
are we even live I think we should start
off this new this new oh yeah tradition
with an opening ceremony which is of
course pouring of the shimei oh and
there it is good this well that's the
popping of this remain
the popping of the shehnai so this is a
Trappist ale which means it's made by
monks Trappist Trappist monks sounds
like a class and evolved its trapper
monks there's such good trappers yes
they put down the dome the arena mobile
arena - for our new show grand reserve
2012 delicious
that's right our so I assume the cheers
I'm gonna power all this what
no I we should make it okay well I think
I think it should be bad enough for both
of us so it has a nice pour Thank You
cap and that poor man's danique didn't
expect to see a perfect pour on
tonight's show oh that's even perfect
I like perfect derp that's a good word
all right now the other thing we should
mention you guys is we do actually have
a bit of a structure for for this show
surprise you know we have an outline
we've been working on some stuff today
doing a little bit of research so we're
gonna be talking since the show's called
awesome hardware we're gonna be talking
of course about awesome hardware why
it's not so tech and that sort of thing
but then we also have a few other random
segments we're gonna be throwing in that
we will get to as well
but since this is Kyle's half of the
show he's gonna start us off with his
first actually not we should do an
announcement first okay I'm giving away
a computer you are giving away that's a
quick internet announcement it's going
on right now I think it's still going on
for another 8 or 9 days if you guys
haven't already entered
I'm guessing everyone who's here right
now since you probably follow us on
Twitter have probably already entered
but if you're watching this later on
down the road go to my youtube channel

ever sit Cheers WMDs juice
Cheers cheers to the awesome hardware
show she just all of you guys for coming
and joining and watching us cheers to
what what what cheers - whines - awesome
hardware just EE ten seconds in work you
just drive immediately
messed up on okay we were drinking
earlier you're forgiven
all right so this is my segment to my
half of the show so I'm gonna kick it
off with a couple segments that I came
up with earlier and the first of which
is a segment that I'm calling to fund or
not to fund aha and it basically
revolves around a couple Kickstarter's
or any go-go campaigns today it's just
gonna be Kickstarter but I found a few I
cherry picked a few that looked
interesting some of which you guys have
most likely heard of already but then
Paul and I are just gonna go back and
forth a little bit and kind of decide
whether or not this is worth a worthy
investment of our top dollar so um know
right from the get-go though when it
comes to Kickstarter campaign yeah like
I've been kind of considering these more
along the lines of like pre-ordering a
video game yeah like and I trust it less
and less one of the things I saw
recently and this is completely
unfounded I didn't double-check this
this could be wrong there's something
like 33% of Kickstarter games I have a
33% of games on Kickstarter have
actually become what have actually
launched Wow so it's 2/3 which is he
never spoke Rafi so so I'm hoping that
part of this segment Kyle and your
inspiration for it is to warn people
possibly of some of these that you might
not want to but I mean there are some
good ones out there we've definitely
seen Kickstarter come through with some
good projects so now is that 2/3 that
haven't that haven't surfaced those were
actually campaigns that had been fully
funded like successfully I have no idea
at all like I said that could be totally
wrong I just I just spat it out right
now probably because of the alcohol I'm
gonna do I'm gonna blame that of course
yeah sweet so this is strafe yes this is
straight
the first one that I picked out and many
of you guys have probably heard of it
it's a kind of a retro game it's totally
a retro game that's built and designed
to to feel like something that was made
in 1996 they even advertised it as being
a 1996 game on their on their campaign
okay
age the little video that they have up
you guys should watch it if you haven't
already it's absolutely hilarious it's
even shot in like a really kind of
cheesy hokey 1996 vibe if you will but
it's basically a first-person shooter
but you know 1996 so it's pretty much
8-bit so to speak and it kind of is
reminiscent of doom the original doom in
many ways because yeah it incorporates a
lot of blood and violence and gore
basically a lot of the same principles
that doom was made up on but it's it's
basically it's essentially going to be a
almost like a I don't want to say a
parody video game but it's purposely
made to be over-the-top and and it's it
looks like an homage it's no much yes
exactly so the older games that we grew
up on if you started started out playing
doom way back in the day right which
I've never played doom so we'd never
play doom at all never yeah I remember
loading doom awful floppies Wow
I'm old what's what's a floppy well tell
me grandpa pull that's it make you go a
few different ways with that one only
about your floppy floppy disk floppy
disk drive yeah yes
that's yeah Mac them today so anyway do
you think people should get strafe is
that the I do and and this is kind of
maybe not as relevant of a campaign
because they've already as you can see
191,000 they're very close there's 33
hours and they don't admit it yeah
they've actually hit it since we looked
at this earlier yes yep as a few hours
ago that they hadn't met their goal
maybe you could still get the game I
think it's a $15 buy-in used to get the
game and then that $25 seem to be a also
money that you could pay to them right
again and speaking to do what you
mentioned earlier I hope this is one of
the 33% of games that you actually go
through
and I will say four games like this I
mean it might be a little bit more of a
risk I mean a less of a risk of saying
you're investing less money so it's
sometimes if you see something it looks
cool and like well there's a decent
chance that might fail but if it's a
minimal investment then you might still
go for it yeah exactly yeah so the next
one I found is called zero spelled and
ugly it's basically an Android console
and I'm not too hot on Android games I
played them occasionally very minimally
yeah usually when I'm bored in like a
waiting room or a lobby area
I'll bust on my phone and play like the
the new evolved mobile app or something
like that but for Android gaming
enthusiasts which apparently there it's
a huge market yeah for the mobile gaming
I think they have this device that kind
of at first looks like any other Android
console you've seen in the past although
they figured out a way to allow you to
use the touch screen on your TV or you
basically touch the things on your TV
without having to look down at your
phone so the way they did that is they
actually have a sensor pad on the
controller that connects to your
wirelessly to the console itself that
has a sensor on the touch pad that
basically pulls up these icons on the TV
based on where your thumbs are so you
can actually lift your thumb about an
inch want one point two inches above the
trackpad or the sort of the touchpad
okay and it'll show it on your TV like
with little circle icons so you actually
know where where you're about to press
or tap on your game which I thought was
pretty cool that's interesting yeah so
although I'm not like I said although
I'm not big on Android games I still do
see the value in producing this kind of
technology you know and maybe this will
be something that's integrated with
consoles later on as far as far as like
you know Sony and Microsoft want to play
around with it so how much what do you
have to invest to get the thing
early-bird I forget what the earlybird
specials 150 yeah that's pretty robox in
a zero pad so you need you need the pad
and then there's a remote box that goes
the connects to your TV right who's I
see her 50 bucks that's
it's pretty steep that's pretty steep I
mean you have to be really serious
that's something you have to be an
Android gaming enthusiast like playing
android games all the time and you're
limited to android games yeah so it's
not like there's was was there anything
else in here about like possibly well
integrating this and using it as like a
PC controller or something like that
like I didn't see anything about that
but okay one thing about that eliminated
games limited to Android at the very
least other android games I'm sorry
other Android consoles that have come
out in the past only offered like a very
extremely limited list of games like
there was a popular one that came out a
few months ago I forget what it's called
but it had like 50 android games on it
and it pretty much flopped because there
was no variety this one you have access
to the entire Android Store the Google
Play Store okay so you have literally
millions of games to choose from and
they all integrate nicely allegedly with
the touch controller yeah I'm always
skeptical when they talk about the
millions of games on the Android store
because no that's true then what's up
with a device like this you also deal
with the possibility of like you know
there's lots of games on the store but
will they all work with the control
inputs that that that that's given
through um it seems interesting it's
trying out something I'm gonna jump on
450 bucks same here but but but
definitely interesting and it's it's
it's nice to like I like the idea of
taking something like a phone like like
I have my old smartphone sitting in the
room and I keep finding uses for it and
I'm like this you know this is a little
over two years old it's an older
smartphone but it's also like a tiny
little tablet and I keep finding things
to do with them like this is really cool
so taking something like that with like
a nice touch interface and a you know on
a decent screen on it and everything
like and being able to use it for other
to control something else alright that's
cool yeah alright yeah if you have one
more here I do have one more this is
this is one you actually picked out and
found for me it's the phantom one
desktop ooh and I thought this was
pretty interesting it's basically a mini
desktop PC a full-fledged PC with all
the parts already built into it that's
about the size of a six-pack of beer
okay so that's pretty small yeah
definitely
the Mini ITX scale there but it's got
very full-featured horsepower and
hardware I think they use a GTX 670 that
hardware it connects make their video
for them it would appear so based on the
high low pay already they have sort of
this glowing lighting and saw and
software yes yes yes
I wouldn't be surprised to be sure now
this isn't quite up to hardware connects
quality it looks nice though
so yeah let's are there pictures those
videos isn't getting to the point can
get kind of like a black a black shell
which looks okay again yeah but then you
look at the the full bamboo version this
is the amazing one yeah so it's it's
definitely some I can't so it looks like
these are probably like maybe laser I
don't know how they cut holes in bamboo
like that but it almost looks like
there's like an laser etched or
something yeah yeah well it's like
there's burn marks like on the edges
which looks kind of cool great is that
on the grilling I don't know
to somebody I mean just where those are
cut out cuz if it's bamboo you can cut
bamboo pretty fine I just don't know the
techniques were actually cutting it that
precise in like a machine fashion it
does kind of look yeah and obviously
that's you know ventilation for your
your components right there as well and
we want how much do they want for this
one I think it's 299 before the bamboo
case the 300 bucks isn't it's an
outrageous for a custom special to
having somewhat custom kind of specialty
case right I mean in wind seems to be
able to keep cranking out stuff like
that so here the here the full specs of
what's inside it's running Windows 7 64
z97 I plus with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
that's the motherboard it's got a 4790k
16 gigs of ddr3 GTX phone sorry GTX 970
yes I think I said 670 earlier than a
wife with four gigs of DDR 5 gddr5 and
one 128 gig solid state drive
they don't say which one it is although
it does say solid state plus a one
terabyte hard drive I'm wondering if
that's that's a hybrid drive with two
separate drives I also like their
listing specs here but the the
the it seemed more of a Kickstarter just
for the case that's so I'm not sure why
they list all of the IRA maybe they're
just saying here is it is that just like
an example system that they built in
that case yeah
probably possibly yeah I think you're
right cuz there's no way you'd get that
for three bucks yeah yeah 300 movie yeah
I would do that Kickstarter 300 bucks
for that whole system in that case fund
oh yeah definitely to fo yeah but I
would definitely ask for a sample to
review yeah sure you know I'm sure
they're watching this live stream right
now of course okay all right so that's
and and and is that the end of your
segment I think that was it
all right that's pretty much it and that
is see what we're trying to do we're
trying to have segments yes we're trying
to get organized and so that was Kyle's
that was Kyle's segment which is called
to fund fund or not to fund and and I
don't know of all those I think the I
think the game is probably the best at
that I mean the maybe it's the hype of
the videos and stuff like that but that
that strafe game seems if it turns out
the way they're they're demoing it looks
pretty cool yeah yeah I could see us
playing them all right next up Kyle has
another fun thing yes all right so this
is another segment that I came up with
it's called face-off and you know
everything is still kind of like all the
segment ideas that I have are still kind
of in beta I mean more like alpha pretty
much yeah pre alpha but my idea my idea
that I had for this segment would be for
you and I to play a game like a really
simple game hmm today we have slime
slime volley I think I remember with the
old flash games like the the slime ball
series but we would play like a couple
rounds I would say like five rounds and
just go back and forth each round takes
anywhere from five to ten seconds so
they're all really quick but in the end
whoever loses has to pay a penalty and
each episode of the show that we do the
penalty will change and I've also even
narrowed it down to three possible
outcomes of penalties and we're
use a random generator to decide what
MLT will actually be what are they I
included all the links in the an outline
page but we can get that bridge when we
get to all right so we're gonna go so no
one's gonna know what the penalty is
well they will and they will after okay
let's let's give them the choices right
now okay I don't think choices whoever
loses is either going to have to a I'm
sorry one speak in a British accent for
the rest of my segment okay alright or
two the second penalty would be I get to
post on your personal Twitter in quotes
I should really build pcs make it more
often I'll post that right now that I
win and then the third and third penalty
is we have to make a funny face to the
camera like right now in this video and
basically give you guys an opportunity
to screenshot that okay and you know the
rest is history
do whatever you want right so we get
some memes really Potter exact perhaps
exactly all right cool it says this
sounds very exciting so to play
multiplayer in this game you select you
select single-player and then you select
your opponent to be human now another
random thing here is that Kyle's got his
keyboard over here if you let us know
yeah this is really cool to see him
storm rapid up a quick fire rapid I yeah
which is actually piggybacked off of a
course Eric a 95 out of the USB timeout
on the USB port on it which I don't know
I'm sure like could be done by just
probably the first people in history but
the keyboard into a keyboard that's
insane there's no need for that so
Kyle's serving I'm green and miles
orange are you ready I think so alright
let's bring it Oh
so you can jump to like give it more
velocity yeah you can jump the other
thing I that I did not ask Kyle before
he suggested this game was how much
practice he has actually had well you
know what I used to play this back in
the day when I was a lot younger like in
high school with my buddies but since
then I have not played just like this it
just came to me I was like trying to
think about well sorry I might as well
just cratered there that's okay I
recovered I've got every quickly oh no
can handle the pot that was that was
pure luck you oh wait I serve now
alright so I guess we're doing
six so the first one to six wins okay
this won't take too long now probably
won't there we go there we go that is
amazing right that's an ace right
I hate when the ball goes too high and I
can't see where it's going so originally
Kyle wanted to play this game and only
this game every every show figure yeah
my my suggestion was that there's
there's so many possibilities for this
sort of thing and don't get me wrong
we're not gonna like sit here and play
this for a while actually one thing that
we are probably gonna be doing is
live-streaming some games later tonight
on our twitch channels right oops
but um I'm getting off topic but for
this on our show on awesome hardware we
are looking for other suggestions other
possibilities um there's a ton of like
NES roms that I would love oh geez I'm
just wow how did I get out of it that
was pure skill Oh God
alright there's a ton of NES roms I'd
love to play but I'm worried about
Nintendo on that one but I know that
maybe some other ones like you never
played turbo graphics 16 did you all
right you have to you have to eat one
and indeed one I'll eat one when it's
you because when your table is so oh so
bent that the keyboard is oh yeah
teetering a table here maybe I'll go
like this that's alright okay oh that's
better
girls we're all still in the shot you
know okay handicap here we go alright
what was I talking about the game yeah
like turbo graphics 16 you I don't know
the fun never played that was terrible
alright so no so there I took I took the
fall there potentially I counted for
taking the fall right yep okay yeah what
other game I mean bad crap all the
classic ones I can think of a Nintendo
like the ones that I would want to just
play for the same nostalgia and that
sort of thing
speak like a really old arcade game or
something like just you know yeah
and you later for that others we could
do like name like the name emulator and
and find some older arcade games and
stuff like that that would be um oh that
was terrible
oh boy yeah well it was my favorite
arcade game I used to play was um the
Iron Man Ivan Stewart's
the the motor or the the where you in
the the trucks the motocross it's not
motocross it's truck racing dirt yes oh
that was awful
well alright so I think I think I won
yay yay God thank God much pressure that
was alright now we need to choose of all
today's Triple A titles this one
stresses me out the most use I'm gonna
make you do it - yeah choose your own
fate British accents oh no no we're
supposed to do random yeah I would
random.org so again number one is he has
to speak supposed to speak Spanish
that'd be interesting yeah I am in
Stuarts off-road that's what it's called
thank you alive oh cool thank you
fantastic alright so number one is speak
in a British accent for the rest of my
segments number two is posted on Twitter
I should really build pcs make it more
often okay number three is you have to
make a funny face so everyone can mean
you alright what's it gonna be what's it
will show your 1d yeah so it's something
that we're not changing work - oh is
that the Twitter yep alright that's easy
I can do that right now
yeah go for it do that man right now I
should have made it should have made it
more horrible what it yeah that's really
funny I need to change my shortcuts for
these every time I do that hotkey to
switch the camera we're using OBS to
stream right now by the way every time I
do that I can switch the camera it opens
a new tab in chrome alright so go ahead
and tweet that out and I'm gonna go
ahead really a build pcs naked more
often and Kyle has another second it's
coming coming right up I've got two more
segments there this one's a pretty quick
one so I should go by its really quick
it's a it's called hashtag
bending and basically refers to all the
the trending topics on Twitter so
usually on Twitter like when you're at
the home page you can see on the left
column all the the trending hashtags
that people are doing so I figured pol
and I could take a stab at one of those
and kind of create our own oh you
tweeted just tweeted I added a happy
face you said it like you farted like I
tweeted that's alright good job Paul
alright good game
so basically today's hashtag that's
trending as many of you might know
well first off it's Pancake Day oh
that's why it's trending is today is
today like National Pancake Day today is
pancake I don't know if it's Matt oh
yeah I don't think it's a worldwide
thing it's can't be worldwide I don't
think people and either celebrating
pancakes today well they should but it
is national game day today for those of
you I didn't even know that until I
logged on Twitter this morning so the
trending hashtag going around is ruin a
movie with a pancake okay so basically
what the what the deal is there is
people are replacing a word in the title
of a movie with the word pancake and
potentially ruining it for the rest of
us so does that really ruin the how do
you search for a Twitter hashtag I mean
I guess it would change the meaning of
what that it would change like the whole
plot it would change everything about
the movie if you replace that one word
with with pancake right it would it
would that would change many movies if
it pretty much everyone so there were a
couple and I was pretty disappointed
when I went to check out what people
were posting about it because I felt
like a lot of them were we're just not
up to par to my standards of pancake
goodness there we go but I was thinking
we could just maybe go back back and
forth and try to fire off a few this is
a pretty useless segment
but there's some fantastic hey so do you
have any ideas - Jered am i oh no you
have prepared yeah pancake movie names
oh yeah this is
my segment you know you'll be more
prepared for your segment no one that
popped into my head immediately was
dances with pancakes that's actually
really good I like that
always a always an epic story of one
man's struggle
it could be farther from wolf than a
pancake that's true couple I came up
with the pancake Unchained instead of
Django and change okay that's it no no
so we knew this would happen
it's nobody nobody moves nobody day
everyone calmed calm down the stream is
still going make sure this is a good
time for it to happen because it only
made the bottom right-hand corner of the
screen black not the whole screen that's
right all right we're back we're back
we're back all right sorry about that
everyone crawl under the table every
time that happens that kind of show this
is awesome so glad we're so glad for
everything yeah so we've we've actually
been trying to get a live show going for
a few weeks now and we've run into just
random issues here and there into it we
want it to be good for you guys or at
least somewhat well put together and one
of the things is the camera raising is
my in my 5d mark ii and although i have
constant power to it and everything it
has an auto shutoff after a while which
even with magic lantern i can't seem to
disable but anyway i'm figure it out as
we go are we going on with the pancake
thing just all right is that the only
one you had all right I'll take it go on
okay I'll read off a couple that I just
thought of the last pancake the okay so
the Last Samurai
the alright things get pretty intense in
that once The Hunger Games Catching
pancake catch worked out Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's pancake we have we
have 50 shades of pancakes 50 shades of
pancake yes of course
black Pam kick down black
like that's just silly
oh it's incredibly so it just makes me
think of like a burnt pancake you know
it's like not only isn't murder but it
fell down
pancakes of the Caribbean this no wonder
you're being pancakes sound delicious
I've never had one I don't even know if
they exist but they sound good
it's no wonder this has trended so well
today because it's it's really one of
those Universal messages that yeah did
that same app take it instead of half
being half half caked there we go with
Wow Boston with the photoshopping there
the girl with the pancake tattoo visual
best one I've heard all have to get done
I like that good job Carol Ann Shaw okay
are we good okay I cut it off okay all
right we could go on forever I'm good
with the all right so that was that
segment no sense that was that segment
we're moving into serious stuff next
aren't we yes we are oh I don't take a
turn in that case you should have put a
link on this story that you wanted me to
talk about which one Amazon's one-hour
delivery service oh I forgot that that's
right you keep talking and I'll see what
I can do all right cool all right so the
next segment we're gonna go into is
pretty standard its news so news all
kinds of news ozitag news but you guys
are all familiar with this sort of thing
so the first one I found was fractal
design our friends at fractal design
Josh if you're watching this I love you
sometimes they're coming out with some
new fans so they're new oh yeah silent
series our three fans yeah
very sexy I'll tell you a little bit
about those first they are keeping with
the the white blades with the black
frames so aesthetically not too much
change but they are kind of expanding
like the size orientation size options
for their fans like black blades too
those are for the dynamic series fans oh
so there's actually two offerings I do
not really
that's actually more interesting I think
than the r3 so that's why I'm saving it
for later I see but as far as the silent
series r3 s go they they are built more
for the mainstream system builder I
would say wide variety of sizes ranging
from 92 millimeters to the standard 120
and 140 they actually they even go down
to 40 millimeters I believe so
getting pretty tiny would be cute -
hello I see 40 50 60 80 90 to 120 and
140 okay that is very small yeah a for
email I mean I I think it'd be cute to
have a my desk cooling me down so
definitely more for the budget oriented
system builder as well they are more
competitive competitively priced from
the dynamic series fans they aren't PWM
just like the r2 s were we're not rpm
PWM but the RPM is rated low enough for
for pretty much silent operation or very
very quiet as we've seen in the past
so basic specs a thousand rpm for the
140 millimeter 1200 rpm for the 120 and
1500 rpm for the 92 millimeter no specs
were given for the 40 millimeter fan
because it probably spins at five I want
to do a system build using only the 40
millimeter fans ooh but like a mini ITX
but like 20 of them in a 900 d well no
everyone want to use like that anti-klan
boy air but then no you can do a full
key for your full custom water-cooled
loop system just all for team it like
make some tiny little radiators find
these crazy radiators like 40
millimeters but it was like 10 it's like
a 400 millimeter radiator Ted all the
normal one wing rig 10 14 millimeter
fans that's awesome alright and then and
then they're also coming out with their
dynamic series fans which is there are
really wrong button news to us so these
are built for more premium system
builders slightly higher price range but
they have they feature increased
performance higher quality hydraulic
bearing as well slice offerings only
include 120 and 140 which I don't think
many ambitious system builders will mind
that those are the only two sizes
available and these are the ones that
will be available in white blades or
black plays ah so that's cool
that's really cool hey I like that again
1000 rpm for 140 millimeter 1200 rpm for
120 and slightly slightly lowered noise
than the 7 Series our threes at about
nineteen point five they have a tripwire
and they have a tripwire I don't know
why I don't either
president the tripwire overall provides
a more efficient and quiet fan
environment huh that seems like two
statements that are independently not
related to each other but they just
match together in the same sentence yeah
that was pricing as well so for the for
the our our threes you're looking at
eight or nine bucks depending on whether
you get the 120 or the 140 millimeter
fan and for the dynamic series you're
looking at 11 or 12 bucks okay yep nice
so that's so bad yeah did you ever find
me in Amazon the week I did or at least
I found one there's a TechCrunch yes
cool I did find it so just a quick what
Amazon's up to they're doing a one-hour
delivery service now which is going live
across the entire island of Manhattan
whereas before I was just gonna be a
small very small and very expensive part
of Manhattan but they've just announced
that they're it's going mainstream it's
going home that's good the whole
enchilada so I'm happy
originally they were just gonna focus on
like a very small and affluent portion
yes exactly but I don't know if they
change the pricing at all because the
pricing scheme is pretty reasonable now
if they were just targeting a really
affluent area it makes me feel like they
were gonna be charging you know quite a
bit for for one-hour delivery but it's
$7.99 you can tack that on to the
already free two-hour delivery which is
only available from 6 a.m. to 12 a.m.
still pretty good okay but for an
additional 8 bucks you can get like
straight-up one-hour delivery but here's
the catch it's not for every item
on Amazon right and that's pretty
expected it's mostly for like generic or
general household items so paper towels
toilet paper maybe some dish so things
that you might actually need in an hour
although you know for people like us and
probably for some of them it's like I
actually need a CPU in an hour if I need
toilet paper it's usually less than an
hour
it's usually five minutes ago most of
the time right so okay so yeah paper
towels shampoo books you get a book in
an hour
sure toys you need your toy now cannot
they shouldn't they shouldn't offer
anything that you can download yeah
that's just my to do oh yeah also I
should be like ooh look action things
are moving okay cool
sorry about that and the products are
available exclusively through their
dedicated companion app that you would
have to use them okay so that's kind of
interesting but that's pretty much it
just wanted to briefly keep you guys in
fill you guys in with what Amazon's up
to I think that's pretty ambitious of
them and curious to see how quickly if
at all does this service spread out to
other parts of the country well it makes
a lot of sense in metropolitan areas
yeah I mean anywhere that you can hit a
large section of people with minimum
investment as far as like manpower and
fuel and that sort of thing um but I I
mean I whenever I'm in large cities like
in Taiwan and that sort of thing I
always gain some appreciation for some
of the things that you can get like at
any hour of the day
right um in that environment but which
is just doesn't make sense to in in
places where stuff's more spread out to
more rural areas but um all right moving
right along next story is a Atari atom
re they're rebooting asteroids okay it's
gonna be called asteroids out
asteroids outposts how post that's right
it's basically a rebooting of the
original a sandbox survival game it's a
sandbox survival game so it's really
nothing like the original no they're
like yeah it's totally gonna be friendly
to
people it is in Latin that a sandbox can
be square-shaped and the original
asteroids was that same size of a field
that plays a bit of a stretch although
if you run out of one side of a sandbox
you don't reappear at the other side of
a sandbox that's a good commence that is
where the analogy breaks down dun dun
dun
philosophy would Paul so basically this
is a going to be taking place on a
massive unforgiving asteroid in their
words you're gonna be a character in
space I'm Fanning deep space and you're
gonna be tasked with missions and
challenges of exploring the universe
mining resources damaging for or sounds
exciting and crafting and defending your
customized base from asteroids
presumably okay so there is a bit of I
guess owed to the original in the fact
that you have to defend your base from
random showers of asteroids make sure
that you you stay alive there but it's
probably gonna have some better graphics
everything
yeah asteroids is all those games that
like you don't hear a lot of people
calling for a refresh or an update right
I mean it is a classic game I do
remember playing it many many years ago
and I've even played different
variations of it I'm shoot what's it
called Wynn roids did you did anyone out
there ever play Wynn roids it was a
little it was like for Windows XP just a
little standalone game you could play
and you'd pop up and it was like
asteroids but they added more to it
there was like some power-ups you could
get and that sort of thing in different
levels but a lot of wind roids and I
remember just those fun little addictive
games but yeah asteroids is like pong
you know you don't see a lot of pong
remakes right that would be weird
I don't know how they remake that
interesting that the ball would be 3d
but yeah developed by salty games just
really quick who are some industry
veterans if you will who also worked on
black ops 2 call of duty ghosts and Star
Trek Online so definitely not just so
cool that's all for that one and the
last article that I have on hand for my
segment and this is actually the last
bit of my segment before we shift over
to Paul is is mars-1
I don't know if you
mars-1 Paul but they're a non-profit
Danish Danish organization Danish or
Dutch but anyway they're trying to send
some people to Mars okay
and it's a supposed to be a one-way trip
and they there's there they are on the
surface right now I know it's already
half it's camp Mars Oh and Utah that's
adorable
but basically they have they need
volunteers right to go volunteer their
lives literally to first for science for
science science they gathered about
200,000 applicants and out of that
200,000 they chose 100 candidates to
actually go to Mars and they finally
picked their final list of the hundred
candidates they don't to be going cool
which is just it's just a trip I'm blown
away they had 200,000 applicants 200,000
people were just like yep semi
tomorrow's I'm never coming back
believe it or not space exploration
tends to inspire some spark of
creativity earth or something more in
people well yeah hello I mean also just
I don't know look at these never coming
back is I know daunting but regardless
yeah so the way they're doing it is
they're not gonna send all 100 at once
they're gonna break them up into groups
of 24 I believe so it's six crews of
four of four individuals will travel to
the Red Planet to Emily in two years I'm
sorry yeah every two years from 2014 so
this is definitely gonna be some time in
the future when I start sending people
out but the aim the whole goal of the
main mission is to colonize is to
colonize to colonize Utah which is
really just a very noble endeavor for
anyone Utah is a barren wasteland those
aren't Martian um but really I think
beneath that soil mmm
there is fertility just more along I
think but yeah it's definitely not that
also interesting information they're
estimating a seven seven month travel
time to get to Mars let's so you'll be
in a spaceship you'll be in a rocket for
seven months before you before you
touched down on the Red Planet mus
patrina thought they I think I think
where we left off was we're talking
about Mars one Mars Utah yes
Canada Utah yeah somehow you took off
around there Ken Kennedy I don't know
where that came from
anyway but yeah so we were talking about
how MIT did the study that it would only
they only last 68 days on on Mars and
you were like well how are they gonna
procreate and stuff you know oh yeah
colonize the planet I don't know I'm
just telling you what I read the article
I had I don't know if there's well I
know there's probably some scientific
backing because you know MIT or whatever
the Mars Death March the death flight
just doesn't sound very promising you
talk about in the Space Shuttle on your
way to Mars what are we gonna do in our
three months before we die I need pissed
if I spent seven months getting to Mars
and only got to live on it for four -
yeah that's kind of disappointing
I would procreate as much as I could
though while I was there so surprised
that to the 30,000 people volunteered
for that I guess yeah B yeah the main
point yes so you know people this is
kind of a mixed bag of people a lot of a
lot of the 100 are scientists and
academics who are doing it strictly for
science but then there's also a group of
a sizable group of that portion who are
just regulars like you me and you guys
who just want the adventure and are just
looking for a thrill you know and the
experience I guess of you probably also
get your name on a list you know like oh
yeah yeah definitely people right I mean
they will they will know undoubtedly
even if they die in the first 24 hours I
mean they're still going down in history
forever
this is huge this is wholly huge but
it's just interesting and you know
they're doing training and preparation
they have like a more simulator that's
not actually Morris as we we figured out
yeah I don't know very strikingly some
blue skies is what
is it away though yeah number one no
boost guys in space we need to do some
more post-production on this video I
think I feel like this could this is
easily a movie in fact there's a TV show
I think like a really terrible TV show
called the 100 where it's about except
it's like you know the first one I like
March bonus like basically earth earth
felt a because you know humans
wreak the hell out of it and then they
all had to migrate to space and then
they spent years and years later they
send a hundred people back down to earth
to see if it's habitable again yeah but
this is like the opposite it's like the
inverse of that like in 102 and distant
yeah like one so this is I feel like
this is just like oh we saw this done in
the movies it's totally possible but
Godspeed and good luck - yes 100 all of
you anyone who's going to Mars that's
back and we're back again oh Jesus well
that's an auto reconnect so on the 3rd
for my third and final outro it's gonna
make this quicker every time yeah buy a
shirt go to my merch store awesomesauce
network.com think of a shirts or a
hoodie there also go to Paul's store
Paul's hardware net take it the Paul's
hardware shirt and thank you guys for
watching stay tuned for part two
hopefully it doesn't drop as much as
this one did and we'll be right back in
a minute and if you're watching this in
the future you want to see part two then
it's on my channel pulse Hardware yes
yes perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
