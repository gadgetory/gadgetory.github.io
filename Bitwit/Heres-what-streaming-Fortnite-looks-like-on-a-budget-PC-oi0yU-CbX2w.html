check check my live hello hi
I think I'm live what's up everybody
the computer says I'm live and I'm going
to choose to believe it so hey thanks
for joining the stream I know this is
kind of unexpected because I didn't
really give you guys any future proof or
future warning that I was gonna be
streaming today
apart from awesome hardware which is
later tonight you will hope to see you
all there in chat but this is just a
quick little live demo a chat blowing up
quick little live demo streaming some
fortnight on a system that I built
yesterday I actually assembled it just
kind of threw some parts together it
comes out to around seven hundred and
seventy-five dollars at the time of
filming which was also yesterday
so there's actually gonna be a part one
video consider this a part two video
that's that's actually launching on on
YouTube living on YouTube a week before
the build video goes up so you'll be
able to see the actual build in about a
week or so it's already up on floatplane
those of you who are sub down floatplane
i've probably already seen it but it's a
it's a pretty solid system for for the
money it's got a risin 5 1600 and gtx
1050 Ti I've overclocked both of those
and I think we're hitting we're hitting
about about 3.9 gigahertz on the 1600
you can see here I've got all the stuff
here up and afterburner on the OSD so
3.9 gigahertz on that and for getting
around you know it in the 1800's
megahertz range for our graphics card
for the 1050 Ti and we're actually
inside of the Aero cool Cylon case which
is one of their newer budget cases it's
like a $50 case or something airflows
not like all that impressive to be
honest but we're dealing with some
pretty lower TDP parts in here so it's
not too much of an issue but I'm just
gonna jump into the game and show you
guys what it looks like I mean you guys
can already get a sort of feel for the
level of quality here we're streaming at
720p 60 frames per second and I think
we're using about a seventy five hundred
megabytes megabits per second bitrate
which is the YouTube recommended hey
everybody sorry I can't reply to like
everyone in chat cuz there's a lot of uh
oh uh oh and the second I stream or the
second I try to launch a game out of
video memory the application was unable
to start correctly oh that's great news
off to we're off to such a solid start
even even chrome even chrome like
completely reset like the chat windows
still open but the screens completely
black what well I guess the answers this
question the the answer to the question
on today's thumbnail is no it will not
stream for tonight and income the friend
requests sit tight ladies and gentlemen
assuming that I'm still streaming and
you guys still see stuff I don't even
know why I'm asking because because I
can't see anything I need to restart
chrome I love live streaming so much
it's like my favorite thing like when
everything goes wrong and you just can't
control anything and people are yelling
at you and chat it's great it's super
great oh cool I am still streaming and
it looks like you guys are still raging
it up alright sweet I'm just going to
give me a minute here breath all right
display let's open this back up
whoo life tech support can I get some
lob tech support up in here all right
I'm gonna relaunch the game so how's
your day yeah I was supposed to do this
yesterday and things got held up so I'm
doing it today which is weird because
I'm also streaming later tonight but
it's funny because I did a test stream
before I actually went live just now and
I was streaming for tonight perfectly
fine for a good 25 minutes and then as
soon as you guys come in to chat
everything's ruined so I'm gonna blame
you guys on this one okay
I'm chalking it all up to your fault
it's your fault chat hashtag blink chat
I'm sticking with it all right so I'm
doing I'm actually doing a display
capture here as opposed to a more
sensible window capture or application
capture just so that we can get the OSD
here because that's a that's an overlay
um if I were just to capture the game
you actually wouldn't see all these
Diagnostics here but at least you get to
see how the system is handling the lobby
the waiting room I mean that's an
important part of the game right all
right let's try this again what's
interesting is that it's saying that I'm
low on video I'm sorry it said that I
was low on system memory right that
pop-up I don't know if you guys could
see it but I I'm only at about 65%
memory usage so I can't imagine that's
the alt hey thanks Barrett for the
donation you guys don't don't donate
anything I mean I appreciate it I really
do I always appreciate when you guys
give me money how could I not but it's
really not necessary if you want to send
a donation to me and Paul later tonight
for all some hardware that'd be great
to your questions there I'm not gonna
bring back trial is it my twins brother
his name is Lyle but he has an accent in
case you couldn't tell
so it sounds like he's saying rile but
actually his name's Lyle he gets really
upset when people mess that up oh my God
we're in the game I don't know all right
now I can actually start talking about
what's going on here all right I'm just
I'm not gonna like meet up with my squad
and we're not gonna like you know get it
lit fam or anything I'm just I'm just
showing you guys the how the system is
performing right now so right now our
GPU is actually staying pretty cool
64 C you can see that there's there's no
bottlenecking here obviously we're at
near 100% CPU utilization again still in
the 1800s in terms of our core clock
frequency
looks like we're eating up about 2.1 2.2
gigs of VRAM so that means we still have
a decent one and a half to two gigs
leftovers quite a bit of breathing room
there as this is a four gigabyte card up
my Chrome browser is resetting again
probably just trying to compensate for
for taking a hit
yeah we're only using five point six
around five or six gigs of our eight gig
system memory we have eight gigs of RAM
right about 71% usage there so it's
actually not too bad and I'm just I'm
just kind of I know I'm not like looting
or anything I'm not really playing the
game I'm just running around to show you
guys but I should play the game a little
bit since that would be more realistic
all right let's meet up with Betty Betty
s20 I'm you can see our CPU is
overclocked to 3.9 gigahertz and this
isn't 1600s so we've got six cores in 12
threads I think this is probably the
lowest I would go if I'm trying to
stream in terms of CPU I don't think I
would get a cheaper CPU if I was trying
to stream because I don't know having
having that extra that extra
multi-threaded aspect is really going to
help with the live encoding
also looks like we're getting pretty
decent frames actually ya know anywhere
from 70 to 80 FPS of course it's gonna
vary based on the scene that we're
looking at you know if you look at the
sky it's gonna go up if you're if
there's a lot of action going on oh shit
out of video memory okay so it's video
memory allocate texture alright make
sure your video card has the minimum
required memory all right well screw you
looks like our VRAM usage was a little
too high even though it was saying we
were only eating up 2.1 gigs was that
so that don't make no sense man even
even GPU GPUs II was saying that that we
were eating about the same same amount
of VRAM let's take a look here and
chrome crashed again so I can't see
anything you guys are saying at the
moment yeah no shit chrome didn't close
down properly reopen up all that shit
this is chucking up to be the stream of
2018 let me tell you there you are a
chat again let's see here
all right I'm gonna I'm gonna close I'm
gonna close Twitter that that'll fix
everything and let's launch fortnight
again so let's let's tweak some settings
let's go into the settings really quick
it's launching right now that's why it's
still black give it a minute
you don't call anyone's mum a budget PC
that's rude I see you be nice to your
fellow chat mates meanwhile I'm just
gonna sip on this bottle of smirnoff ice
tastes just like college regret you know
with a splash of natural lemon-lime
flavor go for tonight go for tonight go
all right popping this back up we're
back in third time's a charm right folks
let's get it done boys all right
at this point let's go into our settings
here I'll show you the sort of settings
we were working with so we're at 1920 by
1080 obviously the stream is going out
at 720 but the settings here are pretty
much high on everything except for
shadows the game was actually crashing
not due to video memory I was getting a
different error message straight from
Epic Games that didn't really give me an
error code or anything but I did some
research and apparently having your
shadows on too high is a known issue
even if you have the proper hardware to
run it so I just put it on medium to be
safe and since I did that I haven't
crashed like you know I haven't had that
that error pop up but video memory I
mean I don't know I feel like I don't
want to compromise on on much of this to
be honest let's just see let's just see
if we put it on medium if if we get the
same issue let's see if we crash out
all right here we go
yeah that's freaking crazy I literally
just saw that news that breaking news on
Twitter about the the shooter at the
YouTube headquarters that's that's
really shitty I hope I hope anyone who's
involved in that is okay I'll it's like
literally all I saw was the headline
because I read it right when we went
right when I was about to go live so I
don't know any details but I'm sure Paul
and I will at least be mentioning it on
awesome Hardware you know what the other
thing I wanted to try is see here I
don't like motion blur in general and I
believe this refers to I believe this
just refers to the scaling if I'm not
mistaken it's a really confusing way if
they set this up but I don't think that
should matter too much okay all right
all right all right
I'm jumping out
let's see how long we last here
further record for the record the video
I shot yesterday with the same system
did perfectly fine when gaming and
playing fortnight without streaming
involved I did I played fortnight for
about an hour maybe an hour and a half
and it was perfectly fine
getting around anywhere from 60 to 80
FPS which is surprising that I'm
actually surprised the frame rates doing
so well I was expecting it to tank a lot
harder because this is the first time
I've tried streaming and it doesn't seem
like the frame rates being affected much
okay get some really nice frame rate
right now I hear a chest
give me all the loot give me all the
loot
hello c4 so you guys can just see some
of the the metrics up there our CPU is
actually in really good shape I mean
we're only juicing 30 to 40 percent of
it right now and we could probably bump
up the quality stream settings to be
honest if we wanted to because there's
quite a bit of headroom there bandages
take it Oh take it all right let's
regroup with our teammates so the stream
is looking I'm looking over at youtube
right now and it's looking slightly
choppy it's it could be smoother and
again I'm at around 7,500 kilobits per
second with the bitrate wondering if I
change that a bit if if we'd see much of
a difference but again this is um this
is a 700 sub $800 build 775 bucks this
is probably the most GPU that I was
willing to afford with this system going
with a 1060 just would have been too
devastating and with RAM prices what
they are I mean I think I had to pay
like a hundred and ten bucks for for
eight gigs a hundred and ten dollars for
eight freaking gigs of DDR for said that
that's like the standard now
doesn't look so bad when I'm just
running in like a straight line but I
know as soon as I like jump into some
action it'll probably look like a chop
fest I don't know we'll see
clear out everything here buddy just
save me anything no if you didn't you
dick see video memory for only we're
only at two gigs the gddr5 it's only
we're only using half of it so um it's
quite peculiar hey will you stop it dick
good lord and I don't know like if
there's a visual difference for you guys
but going from high to medium I mean
yeah yeah I can definitely see the
difference but honestly if you're if you
don't need it to be super eye candy
doubt it looks perfectly fine yeah it
actually looks pretty good
all right so um let's see still eating
up about five five gigs on our system
memory and of course this doesn't
account for you know if you were
streaming this game you would probably
have something like discord open maybe a
couple tabs for your twitch stream chat
I mean I do to you out here on YouTube
but you might have more windows and
applications running than I do right now
so it's good to know that if you were
using this a similar system to stream
this game that you would have a little
bit of ceiling room for additional
programs because we're definitely not at
max capacity if that OSD is accurate at
all thank you all for your friend
requests I I can't say that I'll accept
all of them that might be a little
overwhelming you probably don't to play
with me anyway I'm really bad as you can
probably tell I literally just started
playing this game two days ago and I'm
I'm terrible at building I've learned
that I've just learned to grow so much
respect for people who are good at this
game because I have no idea how they
build so damn fast it takes me like a
minute to throw up like a wall and you
know end of ramp or stairs it's quite
sad
all right but you know what's
interesting it's like we're not we're
not crashing here so maybe maybe that
did it maybe just bumping the settings
down to medium was enough to get us
stable which I mean it's not gonna be a
problem for some people and it will for
others I guess just depends on what your
what your goals are what you're looking
for hope that is a bad dude isn't it I'm
gonna shield up really quick cuz he's
cuz I wanted to take him longer to kill
me that's why I'm shielding and the
other day our yesterday I uh oh Jesus he
looks really good he's got like this
cool suit on and stuff oh God
all right oh Jesus
nope nope nope nope you see me oh no he
didn't see me oh thank god
I'm so evasive so elusive alright I'm
just gonna go this way
all right the freakin AR is there an AR
somewhere in here I know most people are
just really really angry at how bad I am
they can't even focus on on the actual
system performance oh this guy didn't
get any of this stuff you must have
really good stuff already take all this
thank you gotta get gotta get me some
wood I like my wood eh
oh wait no I should probably keep that
I'll ditch wait no I'll ditch the c-4 I
don't need it
you saw
all right so let's let's tweak some
stuff here I'm gonna I'm gonna hide in
here just for a minute and let's go into
our settings and let's crank up let's
see what happens if I increase the view
distance aliasing and textures let's see
if we can get away with that let's also
see how it takes our framerate because
we are getting around 100 to 110 FPS
while we were running around so it looks
like it dropped it maybe five ten
percent but not a whole lot still very
smooth and the visual fidelity looks a
lot cleaner actually just changing those
things this might actually be the sort
of sweet spot we're looking for but time
will tell if we're if we're still
running stable here we could crash out
at any moment people be on the lookout
be warned CPU is still at 40% memories
at 5.5 system memory
the only thing that I had the only thing
that leaves the only thing that's I
don't know that leaves anything to be
desired is that I wish the stream itself
was a little bit smoother for you guys
I'm sure that's just a matter of
tweaking some of the OBS settings I am
using OBS to stream right now by the way
in case it matters that guy I'm not
gonna engage usually my strategy for
these types of battle royale games is
just to not engage until I absolutely
have to at the very end and then I end
up getting like you know fifth place or
something but with zero kills so I
basically just become this like amazing
loot chest for whoever kills me it's
really great I've pretty much nailed
that nailed that strategy down ah no I'm
making a video I'm making a video oh no
there's another dude oh go check one two
check one two
we have my arms can you hear me is
everyone still there press F and chat
I'm sure a lot of F's were just we're
just pressed rightfully so wah-wah-wah
just setting things up here guys gimme a
minute kill me I'm gonna hair alright
cool
things are happening I'm putting this
back up here boo boo boo boo sorry I
kind of have to like rearrange this Oh
be a student save my settings obviously
why would it ever do that why jump it in
here I'm back yeah it completely bricked
the system it just nothing was working
it completely crash so I had to reboot
Oh worry about the system okay that
looks close enough I'm not gonna get too
particular about it
okie dokie well I mean I guess you know
everything was working fine
we were gaming for a good amount of time
there until I move these up
anti-aliasing textures and view distance
of course the things that probably make
the biggest difference visually speaking
that goes it stands to reason that
that's gonna eat up a lot of be Ram
compared to the other settings anyway
Seoul Seoul maybe maybe mediums which
all you got maybe medium is is the best
you can do you know I don't know and
obviously we could we could go one by
one and try it with just you know high
view distance and then see if it crashes
and then try it with just high
anti-aliasing see if it crashes you
could it's very possible that you could
get away with enabling one or two of
these and still run a pretty steady
stream but obviously I don't really have
the time at the moment to troubleshoot
and go through all those options so I
think that's that's pretty much that's
pretty much what I wanted to show you
guys more details will be coming soon
for the PC itself again the the build
for that the video is already up on
floatplane it'll be hitting YouTube in a
week ish maybe a little a couple days a
couple days later but but yeah I I guess
I'm just I'm just gonna jump into
fortnight and just play
because it I think it's fun after I stop
streaming I'm just gonna play a little
bit more before I have to go to Falls
and do awesome hardware but guys thank
you so much for tuning in this was
intentional to be this was intended to
be a short quick stream so I'm sorry if
you guys are expecting something a
little bit more lengthy but I will be
potentially streaming this game a bit
more either on YouTube or on Twitch just
kind of for fun you know obviously I'm
gonna try to get a little bit better so
you guys don't just cringe the whole way
through but yeah thanks for thanks for
tuning in on this one I'll see you guys
tonight 5:30 p.m. Pacific time on
twitch.tv slash awesome harder if you
want to watch me and Paul do our live
show or you can check it out on either
of our YouTube channels we split the
show up into two halves
but yeah should be fun guys thanks for
tuning in have a good one
seeing a bit back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
