it makes stuff cool it makes stuff cool
whoa that's not supposed to happen
yeah hey honey just this isn't good you
know it's fine it's just a little
wardrobe malfunction nothing we can't
handle
where the heck did this Corvette come
from the does he even have a life
oh no he does not we spray put this
somewhere safe just go with the Celsius
line of all-in-one liquid coolers from
fractal design it's easy to stay cool

more info what's going on everyone
welcome back to the channel hope you're
all doing well today is the long-awaited
upgrade of my no.2 of to build the go
anywhere do anything PC which you know I
built last year or so and since then it
really can't do anything you can still
go anywhere but it's been slowing down
incrementally over the last few months
especially when it comes to more heavily
threaded tasks like streaming or video
editing I've actually noticed a
significant slowdown since the day I
built it so we are going to be upgrading
the crap out of it nearly every part is
getting a pretty fat upgrade so this is
really exciting
including I'm just gonna go down the
list really quick for starters were
dropping the 6700 K for a risin 7 1700
which literally has double the number of
cores and thread this thing's going to
be awesome for streaming and video
editing and definitely no slouch when it
comes to gaming
either we're flopping that into the BIOS
star racing X 370gt n which is the first
mini ITX motherboard for a m4 that you
can purchase in the u.s. to my knowledge
I already did a video on it you can go
ahead and check that out
it's a fantastic little board for not
too much money it doesn't have Wi-Fi so
I might have to populate one of my USB
ports in the back with the Wi-Fi adapter
or something like that but for the most
part it should be a fantastic little
board for our needs we've also got a 16
gigabyte pitch that's - 8 gig sticks of
g.skill ripjaws 5 I believe when we
click the speed is on this 32 hundred
megahertz ddr4 with very nice gunmetal
grey heat spreaders and for our CPU
cooler you might not call this an
upgrade because we're actually ditching
the current a i/o that's in the system
right now to this cryo rig c7 which is
an air cooler it's a very small one you
can't really fit a massive air cooler at
all inside of the no 202 that being said
I've worked with this cooler in the past
it's very good for its price and size
and while it doesn't support rising out
of the box I was able to get a name for
bracket for full compatibility so that
should be pretty fun the reason why I'm
going air cooler instead
liquid coolers because there just aren't
many 120 millimeter a iOS that support a
m4 at the moment I may upgrade in the
future but for now the c7 I'm really
excited to see what it can do on this 65
watt TDP rise in CPU for a power supply
now the no 202 already has the fractal
design included power supply 450 watt
which is a B+ certified on all that but
it's not modular and it's got those
hideous ketchup and mustard cables and
even though you can't really see them
from the outside of the case I still
know deep down in my heart that they're
ugly as hell so I'm replacing that unit
with this SF 450 unit from Corsair it's
80 plus gold it's fully modular and it
just looks absolutely beautiful with
those black flat cables and finally
we've got the geforce gtx 1070 mini from
gigabyte this is the factory overclocked
model and i can't wait to use it this is
going to be a huge upgrade over the
existing radeon r9 nan-oh that's been in
here it was a kickass card when it first
came out and now it's really starting to
show its age especially now with all the
super fast Pascal GPU offerings on the
market so that's what we're dealing with
today guys should be a lot of fun and we
will be doing some AV comparison testing
as well of gaming and coding thermal
acoustics all that jazz we'll save that
for the end of the video though I'm
really excited to see what kind of games
can be had with this new hardware for
now let's go ahead and start swapping
these parts out or in or both we're
doing a hardware transplant if you will
right now so let's go ahead and kick
that off three two one go I hope that
brackets made of metal
you
you
you
well pow pow pow pow pow and I don't
know sorry I ran out of royalty free
porn groove music but here's the bills
all complete we looking good I might add
I like the power supply like how it's
all black like how the cables are all
black makes the whole system a bit more
color neutral which is good by me and
look at this cable management it's not
the best but you know I tried I tried it
definitely looks a lot better in the
lower chamber simply because the
radiator from the i/o is gone which I
think also is good for the video card I
think it creates a better thermal
situation overall because there's not
something sort of blocking any potential
airflow that might be coming from this
ventilation here you know the via gtx
1070 mini it is a little bit bigger than
the Radeon r9 nano but not by much it's
actually more you know it's about the
same length but it's just a little bit
taller first I was oh I didn't check
this video card going to fit in the note
co2 but it fits just fine there's even
maybe a you know 3/4 to an inch of
clearance at the bottom there so no
problem in case you were wondering if
that would fit in this particular
casting you end up here let's do got
here is getting you can't really see the
the 2.5 inch drive that's behind this
mess of cables here it's a 960 big
savage from Kingston HyperX and this is
one thing I forget to mention at the
beginning of the video which I'm sure
most of you deduced by now which is I'm
using the same storage configuration as
in the 1.0 version of this build which
includes that drive of course as well as
the 512 gig what is it m2 nvme samsung
950 Pro that's actually known as behind
the motherboard because that's where the
only about 2 slot on that board is and
it's a super fast drive like I said nvme
it's not the latest it's not the 960 Pro
but it's super fast though for what it's
worth so I didn't feel the need to
upgrade really but that's pretty much
all I have to say about the build just
looking really flat really flat man and
so I think at this point I'm going to go
ahead and change camera angles so we can
talk about the thing I'm most excited to
discuss which is performance now this
being a small form-factor system I knew
going into this that I couldn't dial in
a heavy OC for our CPU and our GPU in
fact I left the video card completely
alone apart from
singing out the power and temps lighters
but it already does come with the
factory OC out of the box and it's
pretty blazing fast as is and as you're
about to see in the benchmarks I don't
think it needs to be pushed that much
further at the expense of additional
heat and noise as far as our CPU goes I
was able to dial in an overclock on all
cores of 3.8 gigahertz at 1.3 5 volts
which I'm pretty happy with I did do 3.9
I fiddled with that for a bit I just
couldn't get the voltage low enough to
reduce the amount of overheating it was
getting pretty hot we'll take a look
look at temps in just a moment now our
Ripjaws 5 kit was having some
compatibility issues with the bios our
motherboard so in order to hit 3200
megahertz which I really wanted to do
for the system I actually swapped out
those modules for a G scale flare X kit
which is validated and certified to
support and be compatible with Rison as
soon as I popped those sticks in it was
smooth sailing I had to punch in the
settings manually in the bios of course
but after that the 32 hundred megahertz
speed took just fine and that is running
stable as well now apart from our
rendering and live-streaming tests I
only ran three additional Triple A games
at 2560 by 1440 to give us an idea of
what kind of performance gains we're
seeing with the 2.0 version of the go
anywhere do anything PC and as you're
about to see the results are very
telling so without further ado here's a
look
now if your jaw is completely on the
floor by now leave it to low
temperatures in a small form-factor case
like the note 202 to bring it back up
into place we didn't see the most
favorable thermals here whether it was
with the 1.0 or the 2.0 build even with
the liquid AOR 1.0 system the CP was
still getting up to 86 degrees Celsius
we were running one degree cooler on our
1785 degrees Celsius there's nothing to
write home about that's for sure
but we're still within safe operating
temperatures this definitely build the
case for swapping out eventually liquid
cooled AIO once 120-millimeter a iOS
become more readily available for a m4
and Rison I will strongly consider
swapping that out maybe I'll do a little
update video as far as the GPU goes we
we saw 79 degrees Celsius on the r9 nano
which is actually not bad at all but
bear in mind it's a much slower GPU than
the gtx 1070 which does come factory
overclocked out of the box we are
hitting 85 degrees Celsius on that I'm
going to go ahead and go back to the
drawing board and maybe tweak the fan
curves these are all just running at
automatic fan curves just in the
interest of time once I fine tune those
I can probably get it down a little bit
maybe at the expense of some noise but
overall even though the thermals aren't
amazing we're still managing to pack a
ton of horsepower into a small footprint
without turning our entire system into a
melty combustible pile of goop finally I
did do an acoustics test and I'll let
you know right now the 2.0 build is
quite a bit noisier simply because we no
longer have the liquid cooled AIO in
there and the fan on the c7 has to spend
extra fast in order to keep all eight of
those overclocked cores on our 1700
under wraps that being said it's fairly
unobtrusive and if you're listening to
ingame audio with either some monitors
or a pair of cans you're really not
going to notice it to the point where it
becomes a distress
from your gameplay so with that said
here's a lesson
but there you have it guys this has been
the go anywhere do anything PC 2.0 and
while it's definitely not perfect that
also leaves a lot of room for
improvement which means we could see a
version 3.0 in the near future which is
definitely an exciting prospect if you
guys enjoyed this video be sure to toss
me a like on its before you go and also
