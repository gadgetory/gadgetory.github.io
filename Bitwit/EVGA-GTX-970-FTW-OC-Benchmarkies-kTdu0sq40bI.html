as Leon guys welcome back to the channel
I recently got my hands on this GTX 970
from EVGA but this isn't just your
typical run-of-the-mill video card this
is therefore the Wynn edition which puts
it at a higher factory overclock than
their Super clock or even they're super
super clock GTX 970 s that makes it the
fastest GTX 970 EVGA currently offers
until they released their SuperDuper
clock Edition before I drop this card
into my x99 system to see how she games
here are some specs to get you
acquainted you'll notice the base and
boost clock numbers are through the roof
and also note the cards incredibly low
TDP compared to the last generation of
geforce cards making it more power
efficient than that tacky lava lamp you
can't let go of this is accredited to
the cards GM 204 GPU from Nvidia which
uses the latest Maxwell architecture
less power consumption means more
overclocking Headroom which as you'll
see later is why I was able to push this
card well beyond its factory overclocked
spec I also save so much on my
electricity bill I switched from Geico
along with the Maxwell architecture
comes support for Nvidia's newest
technologies such as dynamic super
resolution MF AAA and voxel global
illumination by the way here's
everything that's in the box and do you
really care
new to EVGA is 900 series cards is there
a CX 2.0 cooler which is 26 percent
cooler 36 percent quieter and uses 250
percent less fan power than the single
blower fan reference design which
literally blows it also has four times
the lifespan vs. other competitors dual
fan coolers the fans have been upgraded
with 11 swept blades to improve
acoustics ball bearings for less
friction between components and a
redesigned motor with stronger magnets
to reach higher rpms even under load
these fans are exceptionally quiet
almost too quiet to the point where I
really think they're up to something the
plastic shroud hasn't changed much since
a CX 1.0 with the exception of some
tasteful metallic blue accents now to
help dissipate the heat caused by such
an aggressive overclock out of the box
before the win edition has three
individual heat sinks and four copper
heat pipes as opposed to the super super
clock model
uses one big fin stack and just three
pipes further enforcing the belief that
size doesn't matter it's about quantity
the card has a black PCB with no
backplate unfortunately a couple SLI
fingers and just two 6-pin PCI II
connectors because power efficiency
video outs include two dual link DVI
ports DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 2.0 now I
ran this card in my new x99 system with
a 59 60 X that I've pushed to 40 400
megahertz on liquid so bear in mind the
results you're about to see our
representative of a high-end overclocked
gaming rig the card was run at stock and
overclocked speeds that I configured on
my own using EVGA precision X great
numbers all around in battlefield 4
although you'll probably want to hit a
good overclock if you're gaming at 1440
I also wanted to point out at 60 percent
fixed fan speed the card never got above
65 degrees Celsius in any of these tests
but of course you can set a dynamic fan
curve to hit your preferred balance of
temperature and acoustics similar
average frame rates were seen in the
Metro last light synthetic benchmark
though minimum frame rates took a dive
just barely clearing 30 frames per
second across the board Crysis 3 the
soul crusher of GPUs everywhere gave our
contender a run for its money as it was
only able to perform adequately at 1080
and some would argue only when
overclocked at that however this does
demonstrate the cards headroom for
overclocking as it saw 22% performance
increase pushing its average frame rate
well above 60 and finally here's a look
at some fire strike extreme numbers so
you can compare your own video card and
system's results to get an idea of the
percentage increase you might see from
upgrading to a similar setup as the one
I have here so there you guys have it
clearly this card has the horsepower to
drive games at 1080 on a single display
especially with that overclocking
potential courtesy of the Maxwell
architecture gaming at 14:40 works ok
for most games but you might consider
EVGA gtx 980 if you're playing super
intensive games like Crysis 3 or if
you're a Mac settings or Die kind of
gamer let me know what you guys think of
this card and I'm also curious to know
what is your take on factory overclocked
cards in general are they worth the
additional price premium and why as
