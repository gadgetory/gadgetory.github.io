absolution tonight and the card I will
be benchmarking in this video is the
radeon HD 7970 this is the reference
design for may and be very excited to
have this card in my system right now
it's a very good card and it's been
getting a lot of good feedback
especially since the new 12 that 11
drivers are out and I should probably
kill this guy right now that was easy
guy was also very easy to kill whoo
fillet knife can I can I chop some
watermelon with this do it I didn't mean
to throw it away and visibly armed don't
worry corpses can't see me although
according to this nice lady that I've
been talking to I should be hiding these
bodies as I kill them but that's too
much work and takes too much time ahead
will require disguise to infiltrate
unnoticed well what am I now hidden it
man's did not see you enter you are safe
you're even if you decide to stop
messing around I'll look at this guy I
should probably kill them huh it's
looking right at me I'm pointing the gun
right in his face he does even care
that's what you get for not caring maybe
you'll care next time lesson learned
buddy suspicious who me now I'm just
just dropping by hey where's that hey
you okay I'll hide you got my attention
ah you susan ear died oh there's not a
guy yeah I'm really not caring about
being stealthy at this point um I'm
trying to play this game for a while so
got all this built up energy that's
unspent I'm gonna spend it right here
right now and it's a something pretty
good for me right now so far all right
what's all this stuff it can disguise
how I disguise myself do I wear his
clothes Wow cool by the way guys I have
not ever played any of the other hitman
games so I'm totally new to this so if
that hold this guy's thing is old news
and I'm super excited about it please
forgive me oh you know what I'm gonna do
to this guy I'm gonna strangle you Oh
what I didn't even do that that was kind
of cool too I have a piano wire that I'm
planning on strangling people with oh
look at this guy oh these are innocent
people I just beat down an innocent guy
didn't I i'm sorry mr. i'm a hit man
comes with my line of work you must
understand I'll spare your life because
you're so hit a full ooh turn valve yes
a game tip number 13 everybody whenever
there's a valve in the video game you
must always turn it it's just a
universal fact of video game life I have
found over the years what did she just
say i'm not sure i think she said go
through that door
and that was infiltrating the greenhouse
who I really want to hmm human shield is
that what I what I saw yes give me the
queue where did the where the queue go
yes yeah human shield here we go this is
fun to be so so so awful I did this in
real life don't you think why do I even
need a human shield there's no one up
here you're you're dead to me go away
control sturdy and just wide enough to
maintain balance okay look good to me
night way oh wow yes s sounds good
smooth hit man very smooth this is like
some uncharted material right up in here
who can I throw this guy out the window
yes I can saw that coming but he didn't
say I like to keep it you are now inside
the mansion or what kinda skies will be
suspicious to the mansion guards either
find a new disguise or try to remain
undetected all right you ready for this
buddy to pull you up those coffee mug at
your head your face what should have
knocked him out I think that thing hard
through the force okay
hi it sounds good i'll hide with you
chef Wow hold up buddy oh no I shot you
in the back like five times what where'd
you come from your creeper oh god not
already these guys are tough man they
don't die telling you you're feisty that
other dude go get him over there jump
over the railing oh there you are yeah
hahaha tried to scare me but it only
worked a little Oh see who's more
scarier than you but you were still
alive and they are not use cover to
protect yourself from enemy fire or try
to slip away and hide okay these guys
are really emphasizing being sneaky but
that's just so time consuming I don't
know if I want to do that the body has
been found the guards will be more alert
really just a little bit more alert oh
not so alert now
use cover to protect yourself from enemy
fire or try to slip away and hide where
are you what're you see no point hiding
I've got this lady ah considered it not
gonna do it so now what what hiding is
for babies I am no such thing oh I got
the key card here we go now we can open
the door here you will unlock an
assassin technique open the notebook to
see your next unlock open the notebook
wrenching the grocer's division chief
Benjamin Travis my former hand let Diana
burn McBan holding it's sold good and
fun all right let's turn up the heat
so I guess Diana used to work for the
agency that I work for she betrayed um
so now they want to kill her they sent
me to kill her but I feel like I have
some history with her and I might be in
love with her it's gonna be hard for me
to kill her especially when she's naked
in the shower right in front of me I
probably haven't had
and god knows how long and now like
everyone play the woman card oh but I do
not give a crap I don't give a rat's ass
I'm a hit man i do work i do work baby
give me that duh clip pucker up stuff
just give me my money oh she's not dead
do the deed no emotion no motions to do
it don't even think don't even blink
don't even don't even bother coming oh
no what's happening she's got a grip on
me she's got a crib oh no we sure kill
you weak why did you do this do your job
man 47 she's she's gonna heal and she's
gonna come back and kill you you're
gonna be a sorry Sally you don't kill
her right now we used to have on forever
no I had to take her away from the
doctors
you would understand fuck something's
not right ya know crap hit man's not
being a hit man right now being a little
sissy there's no time you still have a
chance in my robe a letter
now go take the gun
before Travis find out
please do not
so now I'm supposed to protect this girl
who's going to be kind of hit man
someday or hit woman why do I care haha
this is annoying it makes it easier for
you enemies to spot okay what now bomb
but I'm swiftly and with great precision
note that while you were focusing on Oh
sneaky sneaky rapidly full control cue
to activate points oh my camera to focus
on your ok ok when done tagging press Q
to execute Wow
geez you've got some instinct there hit
man I was pretty sexy you guys are wimps
easy peasy
there's the girl should kill her now
she's gonna kill you someday you know
who I am I know
that's right know exactly what is dead
isn't she damn straight come on stay
close to me what are we going to school
you're clearly supposed to be there
right now get in it's done
excellent work 47 bring the girl to the
extraction point
science but thought I was just a robot
ordered structures do everything that
the agency told me to but looks like I
have a mind of my own it's going to get
me in trouble why did the agency want
you I don't know I guess I'm Diana did
this for you why oh wow please she was
my only friend she took me away from the
doctors doctors wanna hear your till
psycho brain from whatever you're
suffering from it's really blurry like
really bad dream why lady crack they
give you some crack Monday sir there's
nobody here I think the assets gone AWOL
back four hundred and twenty frames per
second only that was real in game
performance I would have to change pants
right now unlocks reduces all right
weapon handling one next level improves
47s reload time I guess I think this is
a good stopping point I'm going to keep
this video relatively short oh by the
way if you guys noticed I did open up
msi afterburner so you have the frames
per second up here that was actually
requested by a couple of you guys and
there it is keep in mind though that I
was running fraps this entire time so I
actually did take a performance hit I
would be getting I don't know maybe 10
to 15 maybe even 20 frames per second
higher than what was advertised up here
in the corner but just keep that in mind
there it is anyway for your reference so
without further ado here are your
benchmarks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
