says I am now streaming to YouTube as
well going live here we go boom hi
everyone sorry I'm late
I know you expect nothing less these
days which is why Dana okay okay
trying to get used to these headphones I
know
these headphones are so weird they have
like a touch a touch sensor on the side
for volume and and stuff but you can't
see it how does this work oh wait which
oh okay weird I don't know if I like it
that's a ROG Strix 7.1 headset that ASA
sent me in that big wooden box i unboxed
a while back oh we have beer hell yeah I
totally forgot that we had beer we have
beer courtesy of Paul let me let me get
this game up in here for ya okay
battle royale obviously stretch this guy
oh boy
okay
let's go on good yay
alright you got good that's not fair
sort of vacation just listen everything
Paul saying right now yes if I'm not
dead we can yeah sure let's shoot for my
place which we're probably going to do
kind of an after party and continue game
in there a little bit longer
which bike are you using oh you're using
the Sennheiser I would I would
definitely trust the Sennheiser mic over
the asus strix mic for sure but this is
the only one that I actually had at home
that I could bring straight from home
but guys I know you couldn't really hear
Paul very well for that little intro he
just did but that's because it's it was
mainly for his stream you're not really
supposed to hear him much unless you're
watching us through a multi stream which
there are links going around and twitch
that I saw
I don't know cell or CCM if you guys
could repost that and maybe maybe even
in the YouTube chat so people can watch
both me and Paul scream at the same time
and can hear us obviously but yeah we're
just gonna be gaming for about an hour
to maybe an hour both to twitch and
YouTube and then we're gonna break off
and only stream to twitch for the last
hour we're just hanging out hanging out
having some fun I'm still very
jet-lagged I've been up since 3:00 a.m.
this morning so and it's already 11 a.m.
right now so hopefully I don't crash
midway through the stream I hope you
guys can keep me up I don't know you
could digitally yell at me or throw
things at me as a game I'm sure Paul can
poke me and stuff in the meantime as
well so that is poking Thank You CCM
my pal separated and anyways if you're
trying to keep things relatively simple
for this one but we're gonna start with
some for tonight
I'm not even your friend on through Epic
Games am i I don't think so
what's your what's your display name
okay I just added you and I'm already
getting friend requests guys I'm not
gonna be able to accept all your
requests it's just it's just not
practical but I'm flattered that you
would all try to add me it's very
definitely boost my my confidence a few
points mine should just be bit wit yeah
I'm not a twitch affiliate because I
don't stream to twitch often at all this
is the first time i've streamed to
twitch in a very long time I'm inviting
you I just invited you you have been
invited sir
me let's do it
yeah my graphics revs are pretty out of
date too probably at least three months
or so or two months
sorry my mic sucks guys I'm sorry
nothing I can do they really did and
it's kind of backfiring on them it says
more about Asus than me but yeah yes I
just have to deal with me sounding like
garbage yeah we are I purposely wanted
us to be in a scarred with other people
because we can use all the help we can
get
yeah we definitely some shoulders to
rest on someone with a strong back all
right here we go oh we just jumped out
I'm following arctic breeze he's he and
mirages are our only hope
they're going to the dusty
my open mic and game let me change my
audio terrible time to change it but
where is oh wait no
here we go please please chest oh god
that's that's a bad guy don't like him
I'm damn that's me
yep I'm dead that's got to be a world
record you do
Oh looks like there's some more dropped
frames on twitch and YouTube interesting
does it say you've had any truck I have
1,300 dropped frames
this really bizarre
all right guys I'm gonna drop the rest
of the show chop the frame rate down to
30 that's weird
you're at you're at 1080 60 and your
stream looks okay I guess all right I'm
gonna try
see
how do you want to cue give me a sec to
figure this out
do you think should I lower the bitrate
it wouldnt that bit rates too low
everyone seems to hate for tonight these
there's a few people what keyboard am i
using right now I am using I was I did
have a coolermaster one here and I
actually switched to this one this is
also from the ROG set is it Blair I know
I don't even remember I only unboxed it
three weeks ago oh yes that's okay
okay I read justed the the bitrate on
both twitch and YouTube so hopefully
that smooth smoothens things out you
guys let me know once we jump into the
game final fight how many how many teams
oh we can do we can try that one next
time on the next one
and gradually lowering my game audio for
the screen guys what's your bitrate for
YouTube poll 3508 thousand oh yeah
you're at ten I'm at 3,500 but I'm
screaming at 720 hopefully that looks
good
yeah a building is really there's a
serious learning curve to it
oh sorry guy jump that already okay
all right do you guys in chat have a
good recommendation for a bit rate I'm a
screaming at seven twenty sixty I was
just following the recommendations on
youtubes via YouTube guidelines but
those could be off
come on get a purple
and we're good shape nothing can stop us
now
I should shred up the HyperX rgv all
right I'm gonna change the bitrate one
more time guys see YouTube 2500 there's
a 3500 before and then twitch its do
2500 again see if that changes alright
so let me know if that looks any better
guys I just dumped it down to 2500 on
both YouTube and twitch where are the
guns either damn gun got wood plenty of
wood
haha oh hello Wow okay alright I'm gonna
do the exact same settings that Paul's
doing because apparently there's still
lag so YouTube bear with me one moment I
will be your alright alright back of the
game hopefully hopefully this works
and I get to use this awesome purple
Gatling gun I did never never used this
thing before
soon here
brain still dropping a no really put alt
f4 and you can see your pink oh no
that's it that is that it's not it's not
there's a close one yeah I think I think
Paul's Paul's connections if it says how
sister's favorite is hardware some
somehow knows we must we must serve our
master
traps I never find any I only find traps
that are other people lay for me and I
die
yeah
the colored markers at the top are our
teammates or yeah or actually it's their
marks pins little pins you know what did
I ever
I am plugged in okay just just making
sure
what's your up speed here
yeah sorry guys I'm not sure what to
tell you I'm using the exact same
settings polish now no odd there but I'm
thirsty
hear him but I can't see him
I didn't help I laid down suppressing
fire
yay
Hey hi I'm not sure what that is this is
a 1950 X got about I think I can't
remember for 16 or 32 gigs I think it's
I think it's 32 gigs of RAM yeah now
it's just the micro ATX board it's only
got four dimm slots but I'm pretty sure
they're 16 gig dims so or 8 gig dims
yeah so we should be you should be good
on the hardware front we've got a GTX
1080 pretty powerful CPU and enough
memory but I don't know I think it's
just the way that the bandwidth is being
allocated at Paul's place I'm not
exactly sure
no and I cannot explain it it's it is a
rare phenomenon
that's close enough
we're doing something with friends so
let's see
twitch hub is the stream look on on your
end is it any better on twitch than it
is on YouTube check my game settings too
while we're at it let's do hi shadows on
medium and let's do a cap of I don't
know what do you guys think 60 FPS shit
man down
you think I fixed it huh interesting
hey YouTube Oh YouTube what does it look
like now
oh wow they're saying it's smooth now
okay so somehow it was just the in-game
settings which I didn't I didn't even
consider I basically in case you guys
didn't see that I basically switched the
settings from the epic preset to high
and I lowered shadows even further to
medium I think and then I switched the
unlimited frame cap to 60fps which is
what the stream is that right now anyway
so doesn't even matter if it's beyond
that
somehow that fixed it so cool
smooth as butter all of a sudden
everyone's like oh my god it looks
amazing good finally okay cool alright I
feel better now I can focus on dying
they could focus on being terrible again
just as I intended
they're saying it's even smoother than
your your scream now call now we know
now we know your router isn't handing
out favors to its master there was a
different game mode that you saw yes
okay yep let's do it
the beer of the day for me anyway is the
slow brew reggae red it's a red ale and
it's 5.6 percent alcohol by volume yeah

Billy dadly scallywag er thank you very
much what what's that let's see
sure quake it up we're gonna play some
quake ladies and gentlemen quake 3 arena

that yes yeah probably only gonna aim
for about an hour so just dream turn
YouTube channels but we're gonna go on
Twitch Go Go screaming books and twitch
that TV / multi-bear my channel oh wait
could not load opengl subsystem clear
quit
I need to double-check that this is
capturing appropriately right that's
true
my had Sunday been opening no it says
it's not loading it worked the first
time and I haven't been able to open it
or launch it successfully since let me
try quake 3 arena non team yeah maybe we
can still do multiplayer oh yeah it does
have multiplayer still can't out tab
okay hold on a second
manager so by bringing up task manager I
found a way to alt tab out of the game
but I still can't pull up xsplit to see
if I'm actually capturing it that's lame
see ya no servers found okay oh no name
okay sure why not
but huh oh how did you okay Oh it's cuz
you have an ultra-wide damn you can see
everything well I'm probably not going
to be able to play this unless I can
confirm that it's
oh okay so I guess it was working yeah
okay I'm gonna put my help say you have
five games give me one sec guys just
make sure everything's in working order
here but I'm gonna move me down a little
bit just like that and also gonna make
sure you guys could see my pretty face
multiplayer fight
I've had to leave wait a cupola just
yeah let's change this resolution shall
we accept
Oh
bro what did you scratch it yeah all
right I've had some issues with that too
so maybe we should we should choose a
different game damn
too bad you did join I killed you once
oh really yeah ha let's let me try it
one more time
I get into the game fine but then when I
try changing it try try changing the
resolution let's try that oh okay I
think so okay I have a really tiny
screen I'm not sure what this looks like
to everyone else okay here we go
now we're in business
here we go all right I'm yeah I can
straight now
image I don't know the doing oh you blew
up yeah you move fast in this game
oh I don't want your cloud money grow oh
Jesus
oh good dad Jesus oh is it not yeah oh
damn it
Thanks chat alright maybe not the best
game then sorry guys I was really hoping
that it would Auto capture like Paul's
did all just seems to be really lucky on
the stream today or I just have really
bad luck and nothing's going properly
but we can always switch to a different
game that we know okay yeah sorry guys
I'm sorry so sorry Hey okay alright
we're switching to overwatch yes you
should be seeing a black screen now
let's let's jump into overwatch and
hopefully you'll be able to see it it's
a very fundamental part about a gaming
stream is that the viewers can see the
game that's being played Devils in the
details
oops options lay let me tweak the
options really quick here guys then dude
oh okay weird it's so weird
borderless windowed aha
there we go
you guys can see that right good great
awesome let's go to play oh wait players
to group I think I invited you okay cool
play I don't know quick play I guess
okay sure
hmm
yeah kill someone
shit I'm killing people this is good I
like games where I can kill people in
oh geez oh yeah
freakin skirmishes I'm like oh yeah I'm
playing for points nope not really this
matters and then when it's a real actual
game I just suck terribly yes you can be
my Butler you're hired
qualifications are that you know English
that you have hands and feet I'm using
the mic that's built into this asus rog
Strix headset which i've been told by
many people in chat so far is not very
good so forgive the poor audio for
today's stream it is brought to you by
Asus I was gonna bring my mod bike
actually to Paul's but every time I try
screaming with that people report a lot
of hissing in the background so I just
haven't found a good headset with a
decent mic yet I think that's the
problem maybe I should just get one of
the Sennheiser headsets that Paul has
yeah now Sennheiser is definitely a
reputable brand I mean even for the
audiophile space let alone like gaming
yeah hundred bucks isn't bad they have
an updated version or whatever
it's a fall I don't like it their
attacks work yeah ah oh geez is this guy
doing no go away oh Jesus what what
character is that look I have no idea
who this is never seen you before you
don't belong in this game asshole
it's like it's like I'm playing a
different game
oh Jesus screw you fantastic laughs God
