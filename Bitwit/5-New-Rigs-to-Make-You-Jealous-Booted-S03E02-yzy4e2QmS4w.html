this is season 3 episode 2 you guys are
watching live here on awesomesauce
network my youtube's channel and in case
you guys don't know already this is a
livestream that I do every single Monday
or I should say every first four mondays
of the month I know that's totally not
confusing at all but every first four
Mondays of every month I'll be doing
this show right here on awesomesauce
Network hopefully unless some shit hits
the fan we have to go back to twitch
again like last week but other than that
it's gonna be at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
figure it out if you're in a different
time zone I can't I can't be father time
for all of you but thank you so much for
being here I appreciate all of your
participation and attendance here in
chat thank you guys for tuning in so
much I'm very excited about this episode
because pretty much marks our halfway
point in this season which is the first
ever high end season of booted so we're
taking a look at systems that are of
$1,500 in value or greater and at the
end of the show I'm going to tell you
guys how you can be a part of next
season as well and how to enter in
things like that so stay tuned for that
but we've got some couple announcements
here first off huge thanks to our
sponsor once again it's cable mod we
took a look at their wide beam LED
strips last week but I have something
even more tantalizingly good for this
episode for you guys this is probably
been in the news at some point but this
is their website they just came out with
a cable mod their own cable mod
configurator for custom sleeved cables
now this is this is big guys this is a
big deal and I'm gonna be doing a demo
on how this configurator actually works
later on in today's show but look at
this link these screenshots just to give
you an idea you can choose pretty much
first you select or any kind of power
supply you want they've got over a
hundred and something different models
of psus that you can choose from so
you're not just talking extensions here
these are the actual full length cables
that go directly from your power your
power supply
your components and you've got all these
options 24-pin you know all your
standard
EPS you know PCIe shit and you can
configure essentially any length of
extent or cable you want so based on the
parameters and dimensions of your case
and where your components are you can
measure out exactly how long you want
each of these sleeves to be at each of
these cables to be that way you're not
taking up any unnecessary space in your
system which is pretty epic and this is
even more epic you get to choose pretty
much any color on any cable you want to
your heart's content they've got three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve different colors to choose
from guys and you can pretty much have a
field day go you could do it you know
RGB you can make the ugliest cable ever
and people will hate you for it but you
can do it you can do anything you set
your mind to this is a very
inspirational ad right here and then
they've also got some other extras you
can add on like they're very nice
transparent cable combs as well as some
some very nice colored SATA cables as
well but we're gonna be doing a demo of
this later guys if you want more
information right now you can't wait for
the demo to come and just like you know
twenty minutes or so then there's a link
in the description below of this stream
slash video where you can check that out
play around with it so you already kind
of have an idea of how it works but it's
really really cool stuff I know the
community the PC DIY community has been
waiting a long time for something like
this there might already be something
like this I don't know I don't know I
don't have all the answers guys but I
haven't really seen anything to this
degree of detail orientation as the
cable mod configurator so very exciting
stuff from those guys also feel free to
check out some stuff on my site as well
I've got some shirts guys some shirts we
are selling shirts the new CPU cooler
relatively new Heather Navy shirt which
is a now a very nice comfy material
these have been flying off the shelves
very good stuff I've also got the the og
CPU cooler shirt if you guys are just
classic like that and just like the
regular cotton I actually kind of prefer
the regular cotton I don't know it
doesn't show my man boobs as much but
I've also got the BIOS flasher shirt now
in stock and these have also been flying
off the shelves as well
two different colors here that's a bios
chip by the way and he's getting flashed
by a creepy perverted flasher it's
adorable
so metal gray I've got the heavy metal
gray color as well as the maroon my
personal favorite a range of sizes to
choose from as well so whether you're
anorexic or huge I've got you covered
quite literally so I'm good stuff all
around yo I forget to send out my show
tweet boom did it well so yeah we've got
some really exciting contenders for
today's show guys I'm very excited to
show you these these dudes and their PCs
so if we want to take a look really
quick and recap from last week we had
Alex who is our week one finalist and
pretty much a landslide I wouldn't say
the biggest landslide we've seen here on
booted but definitely leading by a
sizable margin and the reason why I love
Alex as our week 1 finalists so far in
the high-end season 2 booted is because
there's nothing too crazy going on here
there's I mean there's no liquid cooling
of any kind he has one granite it's a
solid GPU but it's it's one GPU it's not
like this crazy two-way SLI or crossfire
machine it's just it goes to show you
that you can have a really nice clean
looking system that looks better by a
landslide than other systems that have
you know thousands upon thousands of
dollars of hardware in them crammed in
as much as possible so this it really
comes down to like you know the kind of
tactics you use how clean your cable
management can be and that's all that
has nothing to do with how much money
you have to spend on a system and that's
why I really like the fact that Alex
took this
finalist slot home last week so
congratulations congratulations you can
Eric I'm very proud of you but you do
have some heavy competition coming up
for you sir and we're gonna start it off
by talking about PC number one from
Andrew alright and he's rocking an
evolved ATX case beautiful case by the
way that I think Dmitriy from hardware
connects gave the Evolve ATX case of the
year for 2015 and well-deserved at that
we actually have a couple evolve ATX
chass√© ease in this season of booted
but we've also got a
x99 5820k and we do have a lovely gtx
980ti for the win edition EBG a babe at
16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance rim look at
them sleeves
I like those cables bro I like them
cables Andrew I like how you got the
cable combs in there shows shows your
dedication I also like how you swapped
out a lot of the fans pretty much every
fan in here that I can see with venturi
fractal design fans having some fractal
fans and in enthu or in a fan tex case
it's an interracial hardware porn there
Andrew we're getting getting into Tabu
territory but I like it I like the way
you think very progressive my man and
look at that NZXT hue plus just chilling
there on the hard drive wall oh that's
sexy that's super sexy
I like that implementation there Andrew
you're doing thanks it's doing it for me
I like the money shot as well very clean
diggin that cracking x61 there very nice
very nice what we got here oh all right
so we've got the hue plus all lit up I'm
not sure if these are just your colors
of choice or if you were just kind of
randomly throwing throwing on some RGB
goodness there but yeah sharp indeed
sharp indeed very clean some people are
saying looks okay I I personally like it
I think you did a good job here Andrew
better than 90% of the pcs I've seen so
far and booted at least in the high-end
season you're definitely in the running
my friend look at that - yeah all right
cool and I don't really see any problems
with your hardware configuration either
kind of jealous of your your SSD
configuration there quite frankly one
terabyte and a 250 gig Samsung 850 Evo
primo I think we're gonna start seeing a
lot more high-end systems that are just
omitting the mechanical drives
altogether just because of the lowering
costs for for a mid-range - you know
obviously mid-range and below SSDs are
still not that affordable - just
completely go 100 state but we're
getting there
we're getting there it's nice to see
nice to see so thank you Andrew next
we've got George or if if you're from
Mexico Jorge
in the fractal design define s not a bad
case we've also got Xin here as well 59
30 K there will take water 3.0 ultimate
and look at those fans look at those
fans what about those fans it looks like
you custom-painted all of the fans here
which are also fractal design venturi
fans beautiful looks like you did a
pretty got a pretty nice paint job there
as well let me see
yeah yeah you did a fairly nice job
spray-painting those fans those blades
that I like it I like it you've also got
two gtx 980ti s from msi durham sun with
a custom painted sli bridge as well very
nice and I also like what you did with
your SSDs those HyperX savage drives
just chill in there on the reservoir as
I like to call it not typically a place
that you would mount SSDs at least
according to a user's manual for this
case but you've managed to get them on
there either you either screw them in
from the back or using some velcro and
either at either point it looks really
nice that you have both of them there
obviously the color coordination here is
on point everything from your
motherboard
to the fan blades your SSDs cables video
card SLI bridge everything is on point
sir you probably have the best
color-coordinated themed system here
with that red and black only thing that
could have made it more
color-coordinating is maybe getting some
dims with some red heat spreaders on
them instead of all black but I'm not
complaining because that g.skill kit is
quite beautiful as well man this is
gonna be a tough one guys this is gonna
be a tough voting round I can already
tell you've also got some LEDs in here I
got some white LEDs now it looks like
you've only got the top and the front of
your chassis lined with those strips
however with a side panel window on it
looks like it's pretty evenly coated all
around it doesn't look like there's any
hot spots sometimes when I see like a
system with a side panel window and it's
got an uneven lighting it's almost like
looking at a monitor like a an IPS
monitor with heavy backlight bleak or
just like super bright in this one
corner and darken all the rest kind of
like that
but it seems pretty even all together
here so good job on that mate
I do like it I like it I like it and I
like the again the bit of custom work
that you did here getting everything
nice and color-coordinated I appreciate
that because you could have just found
some fans with red blades in them and
saved yourself the trouble they probably
would've been cheaper than the fractal
fans too however you knew that you
wanted those fractal fans and you knew
that you wanted you didn't want to
sacrifice performance in your airflow by
the way Holy Mother of airflow am i
right look at this there's like eight
fans in here Jebus so I do appreciate
that you know I can respect that that
you bought the fans you wanted didn't
sacrifice anything in terms of
performance or acoustics and things like
that and just decided to do the extra
work and spray-paint them and it came
out great
so very nice Jorge Jorge you have a man
next time we've got Thomas number three
piece of number three again in the
Evolve ATX like I said there was gonna
be a couple of these 5820k still rocking
the x99 this is uh this has been all x99
haswell-e shit so far this episode which
I'm not complaining got a very nice ek
predator 240 we don't see too many of
these unbootable I maybe it's because
this is our first high-end season
obviously but it's such a nice AI oh I I
haven't even physically held one or seen
one in person but they just look
beautiful because it's pretty much
essentially all custom parts that ek
just threw together as an AI Oh as a
closed-loop cooler and you've got a very
nice you know push-pull configuration on
it as well blasting intake into your two
gtx 980ti s classifieds damn son I mean
the title of this this episode says it
all I am super jelly with a lot of the
the hardware that's packed into these
systems today and you've also got that
very niche but also a very beautiful x
a9 SOC champion board from gigabyte
where they've only got the the two or
they got they got before DIMM slots
instead of the traditional eight on a x9
ATX board because it's you know
apparently better for overclocking and
things like that setting world records
but the one thing I would say here is
that it has such a nice beautiful orange
hue to it on the board those those
orange accents I would have liked to see
maybe just you
spray-paint the same shade of orange on
the red strips on your video carts cuz
you've got you know the orange on the
motherboard we've got red on the cards
yeah it doesn't quite match up still a
very beautiful system altogether All
Things Considered but that would have
been sick
I think orange is a highly underrated
color for 4 pcs I really do I don't
think it gets enough credit I really
love it a good I love me a good orange
and black build makes me feel like I
don't know it's Halloween I don't know
where I'm going with that but I like the
way it looks super sexy I also like your
your addition of that Samsung Evo right
there the a 50 Evo I like it yeah man
this is good so that's that's the thing
I would say you know getting some more
orange in there to color coordinate with
your motherboard would be a smart choice
and um and maybe even like I don't know
I feel like if I was you there's not
much else to do here with this system
it's already beautiful but as a PC
enthusiast like I feel like a system is
never truly done so I think if I were if
I had the money I would probably go to
like the cable mod custom cable
configurator that we just talked about
and actually throw together some nice
black and orange custom cables for this
system I think that would make it look
like a showpiece that would really that
would do it for me that would do it for
me so altogether though very nice built
honest these are all just so lovely
let's move on to Casper he is the
friendliest ghost you know sorry I had
to I had to give you some some shit you
know I apologize it was very immature of
me what were you expecting though from
me what were you expecting honestly
Casper you've got a noctus 450 the the
dark knight cases as myself and many
others like to call it and NZXT kraken
x61 ACU z97 motherboard eight gigs of
Crucial Ballistix and an msi r9 390 so
let's go ahead and take a look at the
side here get a better idea
so z97 you're not necessarily on the
latest platform but that's okay because
you don't need to be in order to win
booted that's that's the how the show
should work live viewers who are voting
today keep that in mind however I would
have liked to see a bit more than eight
gigs in your system I don't know I feel
like you know that that also comes with
the new platform with z170 everyone's
you know rocking eight gig dims now at
least a dual-channel kid so they've got
16 gigs in their system that wasn't
necessarily the case we weren't quite
there yet with z97 it was still like
eight gigs was still like the mainstream
standard so I guess I'm not gonna take
off any points for that however I do
think the dims could have matched a
little bit more with the rest of your
system Crucial Ballistix sport I mean
obviously they're low profile they have
that benefit I would have liked to see
some some more black and red though in
there if possible also I mean I can I
can't take off any points however all
the other systems that we've seen today
had like custom sleeved cables and this
one's just using the default ones that
came with the the EVGA supernova which
is perfectly fine but you can definitely
tell the difference
looking right off the bat you can tell
when it's like stock cables even if
they're all flat black which look
arguably nicer than ketchup and mustard
there is still a difference there but I
also realize that there's no CPU listed
here
Kasper actually that's that's probably
my fault why don't why don't I have your
CPU here let me go ahead and double
check this really quick this is week two
Kasper what audio give me your specs oh
you didn't include your CPU sir and I
missed it but it is I can't confirm guys
he has sent me the the hardware monitor
spec sheets the you know he screen
grabbed it it is in fact a Core i5 4690k
I can't confirm and I can also confirm
that is in fact in our line 390 so
there's no foul play here now you guys
know thanks for catching that guys yes
it is a 4690k
there you go all right now everyone's
happy you can all sleep at night all
right
so good at least it's a at least it's an
unlocks cue if you're rocking an AI o
CLC then I'm glad you're doing some
overclock in there or at least I would
hope so honestly pretty pretty nice
build here I think there could be a few
more bells and whistles to make it a
feel bit more premium more putting them
quality
I also wish that they're kind of
confused as to why there's no rear
exhaust fan there maybe you took it off
and slapped it on to the front of the
case or you just don't like the look of
the fan they're less noise I'm not sure
but it doesn't look like there's any
clearance issues especially with those
those mounting slots that you can kind
of position the fan to not interfere
with your top radiator there so no I
don't know why I don't have a fan there
it'd be interesting to find out and and
yeah look at that that is that is very
beautiful the all red red and black
there if you're going with a red and
black theme system not just for 50
probably like in the top three cases to
go with if you're rocking a red and
black theme rig so overall I really like
the way this this looks I really do I
really do
cool thanks Casper you're a pal and
lastly we've got League number 5 PC
number five with the NZXT switch 810 I
think this is a very underrated case as
well and I really like what Lee has done
here with the the switch 810 I'm gonna
show you that in a sec he's also rocking
the 6700 K we are on skylake bitches 32
gigs of corsair dominator plaques I like
saying down Platts 32 gigs of course
there Dom plants just sounds I just
sound cool I feel cool when I say it and
then we've got two gtx 980 uh-huh I'm so
used to seeing 980 eyes they're actually
970 s so 970 SLI alright and not only
that you've actually slapped two custom
coolers on them the Kraken x40 ones look
at that now do you guys notice what I'm
talking about here when I say I really
like what Lee's done with
the implementation of this case look at
this because you know he's got this case
has those two fan mounts right in front
of the the drive cages there so you can
direct air flow directly on your
graphics cards well he's actually
instead of just used straight up fans
he's mounted both of the radiators from
those those Kraken coolers those X 40
ones into those slots and I don't think
that was 100% NZXT s intent I don't
think they expected people to use that
feature in that way but I really like it
personally and I feel like this is one
of those really unique things that you
know not many people think of and when
other people see it it's a love or hate
affair you'll either see this and be
like why didn't them there it looks
stupid or you'll be like me and be like
that looks freaking awesome I'm very
impressed that you thought of that I I
mean maybe I'm wrong maybe people do
this all the time and I just this is the
first time I'm seeing it yes it does
look like a tentacle porn special I will
agree with you on that and that that
could be a bear reason why people don't
like it this is a not quite as you know
elegant of a solution as custom
water-cooling maybe where you've just
got more you know you've got a single
loop that goes through all everything
rather than these individual radiator
loops you know you've got three
different loops going on here but you
know what I think it's unique I like
that and you got the NZXT q+ in there
NZXT fanboy for sure you are Lee I can
smell it on you there's nothing wrong
with that though and I really love RGB
lighting in white cases I realized this
when I built the white build months ago
that RGB doesn't look nearly as nice in
like a black and whatever color unless
it's like a black and white system if
it's like black and blue or black and
red or black and green I mean not that
you want RGB in a system like that
anyway but more black equals less
reflection more white equals better
reflection and can really bring out the
colors of those LED strips there
yeah it just looks really nice that's a
good good strong system just taking a
look at your other shit you've got a
pretty hefty SSD storage solution there
and yeah man
sexy sexified I noticed that you didn't
turn the fan of your power supply
downward where there would be you know
some ventilation there I think I'm
pretty sure the switch 810 has
ventilation for your power supply but it
doesn't bother me I'm not gonna knock
you points for it some people might be
like or even mean the past like well you
should really flip your power supply if
it's not affecting your attempts at all
then I don't care and maybe you just
like the look of it better that way
that's fine you do you Lea you do you I
am NOT racist just cuz I like the white
that's gonna be taken completely out of
context and on that note that is all I
have to say about those five contestants
Yeah right sweet
okay so right about now it's the it's
voting round it's voting time so right
about now you should be seeing a link
that my lovely moderator Mike the man a
geek will be posting in chat right now
yeah so if you see that link go ahead
and click it now in and vote vote on
which system you think is is worthy of
heading on to the next round because
only one can go on to week four the rest
of the systems will be booted
unfortunately and sent home with nothing
now then in the past I do want to
address this it's just a little thing
but this is the the the same poll system
that I used last week and a lot of
people were like dude this is a broken
poll because everyone can vote twice you
can vote more than one time you I'm
voting multiple times and it's like not
kicking me out or anything
this is may by design this is by design
you can for the record you cannot vote
multiple times you can only vote once
I've actually contacted one of the
representatives of this company who
designs or who knows developed this poll
service and that's by design you're
supposed to think that you can vote
multiple times it's their way of
detracting any kind of scammers who are
trying to fraudulently send in multiple
votes
because they'll think oh my second and
third and fourth vote is going through
and so at that point they'll stop trying
to like find other ways to hack the
system so to speak and now that I've
just told you all of that you all know
exactly you know how and why you should
try to hack the system further but I'm
hoping in your in good faith that you
guys won't do that but that is that is
an issue I wanted to address because I
want this to be a very fair fight and
and I believe it will be there's also
certain security measures that this poll
service implements that should help ward
off you know foul play things like that
I also have access to like the time
codes of when people vote so I can see
real time when people are voting and how
many votes a certain PC gets so for
example if you know PC number three got
200 votes in five seconds I can see a
chart that tells me that and I can look
back and go okay there is there's
something suspicious here let's do a
revote shit like that so um guys don't
worry too much about it just focus on
which PC you think deserves to go on to
the final round I know it's gonna be a
tough a tough call but just to give you
guys a little bit more time with the
voting I want you to really think it
over we're gonna go ahead and take a
closer look here at cable mods
configurator because it's just so damn
cool now what I want to do is actually
just go through the emotions here and
give you guys a quick little demo and
how this works if you guys haven't tried
it already which I'm sure a lot of you
have because it's super cool
I see which power supply do I have
currently that I would like to make a
custom cable for I have a Corsair ax
1200 I that's just chillin so you get
you can look you can see all these
options here you've got a ton of
different very popular power supply
options this is just from Corsair so you
can go you know EVGA and get all these
EVGA options super no up up the in yang
so I'm going to stick with the Corsair
for now they've even got be quiet in
there that's impressive X 1200 I
maude flex paracord there might be a
different different material you can use
here but I'm not sure if that's
supported with every every power supply
I have to double-check on that
so we're gonna get a continue next step
and you can just select whatever cable
you want oh and you can select multiple
ones too we're gonna start with the 24
pin add it now this is a 39 it's listed
here as $39.90 USD so it isn't super
cheap I will admit to that
however if you guys have ever tried to
custom sleeve your own cables before you
know that this is a fair price I I would
easily pay someone this amount of money
to custom sleeve my cables if it was
something more complex than what you
could get say from like you know from
BitFenix a--'s or or cable mods or
anyone silver stones regular offerings
right if it was just plain white sleeve
cables then I wouldn't go through this
service that's not exactly what this is
intended for if you want this if this is
what you want if you want a bunch of
what you just want White Plains sleeve
cables then don't use this configurator
that's not what this is for just go buy
some cheap shit this is like if you want
to go all out like custom right like i
want to freaking i want like a nyan cat
freakin themed cable right here and i'm
just gonna do it i'm gonna live out my
dreams and yank at it yank at it and
then pick like you can't buy this you
can't buy this exact cable custom
sleeved until now look at that that's
that's that's what i'm gonna go at this
is the this is my cable my 24 pin I'm
gonna make an epic RGB mishmash color
themed rig and then you just you just
you just go to the next page and then
yeah you can add more cables if you want
I don't know if I actually showed you
guys the ability right here oh no wait
what happened I I backed out I backed
out of the the thing for the thing bad
gateway oh hell no you're not gonna crap
out on me on my show
i crap out on you damn you damn you
perhaps my perhaps my network is is a
little bit stressed right now since i'm
streaming booted cable mod websites
you've been booted okay so for whatever
reason I'm not gonna take up too much of
your time guys but what I am going to do
is I'm going to actually buy that
extension the funky rainbow color one
I'm gonna buy it probably after I starts
stop this show and and then hopefully by
next week or maybe in the next week or
two it will arrive on my doorstep and
I'll show it off in person for for a
future episode of booted which I think
will be really cool because I'm will be
able to check and review the quality of
it and things like that I'll be able to
show it to you guys up close very
exciting stuff again if you want more
info there's a link in the description
you guys have eyes and fingers for
mousing just click that link and it
shall be yours okay
on that note why don't we go ahead and
queue up the dramatic voting music
because we've got some shit to tend to I
gave you guys enough time I think to
decide on which of these five pcs would
be going on to the final round and while
I think there is potential here I'm
sorry Thomas I can't really get you in
the screen won't scroll down any further
than that this is gonna be a close match
unfortunately there can only be one of
you and the other four as the show goes
will be booted and sent home with
nothing so who is it
it's an Andrew George Thomas Casper or
Li let's find out boom George in first
place with 40% of the votes 196 my
goodness let me go ahead and enlarge
this for you so you can see the ranking
BAM look at that George congratulations
you are our week 2 finalists the rest of
you Andrew Thomas Caspar Lee I was
sorry you gave it your all but in the
end you remove it
alright so George let's take a look at
George's PC one more time yes yes indeed
that custom cabling that custom paint
job
oh it's also beautiful it's also
beautiful I love it very nice job George
I think you did you really knocked it
out of the park here yeah jeez well
deserved sir well deserved
I think the audience has chosen wisely
yet again so we will be seeing you in
week four sir it's gonna be exciting so
now we can take a look here really quick
we've got George all right we've got
Jorge this is like a big time you know
multi-gpu power system just ridiculous
and then we've got like a more
minimalistic Alex
it was our week one finalist and just
completely different systems but equally
impressive for different reasons I'm
very excited to see how this first
season turns out I'm super thrilled so
thank you guys for actually being here
and participating now don't go anywhere
because I did promise you earlier at the
beginning of this show that you'd have a
chance to enter season four of booted
which is next month in May YRT almost it
may this is crazy
um so just take a look here submissions
for booted season four are now open
until April 13th and that's that's two
days away it's April 11th at the time of
shooting this video so I'm only giving
you guys two days and the reason why is
because this is another high-end season
nobuta we're doing back-to-back high-end
seasons and I still have a lot of
submissions that that perhaps are going
to qualify for next season so I don't
actually need that many more submissions
that are new which is why I'm limiting
the submission period to only to two
days or so so you're gonna have to get
in your entries quick guys there is a
link in the description below on how to
enter again
this has to be a PC of fifteen hundred
dollars in value or more in USD and
that's approximate you know you'd have
to be like ah fourteen hundred and
eighty dollars I didn't make the cut its
approximate guys but if you're like you
know thirteen hundred dollars or less or
something like that then I wouldn't
bother trying
and I do have a quick if you do head to
that link in the description then you
will find a webpage like this on the
awesomesauce network web page and just
gives you very thorough and detailed
information instructions on how to enter
guys you have to follow all these
instructions very carefully otherwise I
won't think twice you just you just
won't be considered I get so many
submissions for this show it's unreal I
don't have time to work with you at all
if it doesn't follow every single thing
here to a tee I just don't even bother
downloading your entry or looking at it
because I just don't have the time I
really wish I did and and also camera
quality plays a huge role there were so
many systems that I had to disqualify
for this season actually that were just
immaculate so many good systems that had
a fair chance of winning they really did
but because the camera quality wasn't
there I couldn't have them on the show
so very unfortunate make sure you guys
could get the nicest camera you can and
lighting is lighting is 90% of that you
can have a really kick-ass camera but if
your lighting sucks or it's like
orangish and horrid or blurry
out-of-focus
anything like that not gonna have too
high of a chance of getting on and also
I will give you another recommendation
custom sleeve cables or just regular
sleeved extensions that are you know
that you buy pre-configured will help
your chances immensely for these
high-end seasons of booted a lot of
systems just don't look quite there if
they've got you know ketchup and mustard
or even like just regular flat black
cables so bear that in mind as well if
you guys again want to catch the show
