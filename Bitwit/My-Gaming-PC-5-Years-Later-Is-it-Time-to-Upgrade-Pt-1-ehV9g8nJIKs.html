posted earlier this week I gave you all
a close-up look at the many different
pcs I have strewn about my house one of
which was my very first rig on the Intel
Sandy Bridge platform that I built back
in 2011 in the video I also mentioned an
idea that I had to do a comparison video
between my five year old desktop and a
modern-day PC using equivalent Hardware
relative to its generation I figured
this would be an interesting test for
those of you with similar aging gaming
PC's who are still on the fence about
whether or not it's time to upgrade
while things like compatibility and new
technology support should always factor
in to your consideration when upgrading
to a newer platform today's test will
focus mainly around Raw gaming
performance as this is usually among the
top priorities for most gamers so
starting off with a closer look at my
old PC it's been rocking a core i7 2668
chipset with the GTX 670 directs you to
from Asus this was a killer high-end
machine when I first built it years ago
but will soon find out whether it still
has what it takes to meet today's gaming
demands now truth be told I actually had
some trouble getting this rig to work
properly
neither the GTX 670 or the integrated
graphics on the 2600 K we're outputting
a video signal when connected to the
original z68 asus motherboard so in the
interest of time I actually moved the
CPU and video card into my wife's PC
which is currently housing a slightly
newer z77 board while this should have
very little to no impact on gaming
performance I felt it necessary to be
transparent with you guys about the
exact hardware I'll be using for today's
tests apart from that though I'm even
using a similar 240 millimeter a IO and
my original 8 gig 1600 speed DDR 3 kit
so despite the Evolve ITX making this
look like a high-end machine this
modified version of my wife's PC should
still give us an accurate depiction of
my old desktops performance now our
current gen system is a slightly
cut-down version of my sleeper PC that I
built just a few months ago don't let
its appearance fool you though the rig
sports a core i7 6700 K the latest
flagship unlocked quad core from Intel
that has essentially filled the role of
the 2600 K
three generations later so this is
actually a good match up for our testing
will also be using ddr4 memory and
double the capacity of my old PC thanks
to the z170 chipset the cut-down part of
this rig that I mentioned pertains to
the graphics I swapped out the existing
gtx 980ti for a gtx 970 the succeeding
video card that arrived two generations
after the GTX 670 one of the big
advantages that newer gen cards have
received over the last few years is a
drastically increased frame buffer on
flagship models so it'll be interesting
to see how well the 2 gigs of memory on
our GTX 670 hold up against some of our
Triple A games now seeing as how both of
these rigs are armed to the teeth with
unlocked processors liquid coolers and
discreet GPUs you can bet your Nash that
I dialed in some hefty overclocks what's
nice is that our CPUs and GPUs in both
systems are great overclockers but
despite my lead fingers it was important
that I not push them to speeds or
voltages unsafe for a long-term
operation so for my old system I took
the 2600 K 240 400 megahertz and pushed
the GTX 670 to twelve hundred and
sixty-seven megahertz the 6700 K was
also dialed in to hit 4.4 gigahertz and
our GTX 970 saw max clock speed of
fifteen hundred and seven this
definitely increases the overall
horsepower of our pcs and utilizes their
components to their full potential while
staying within safe operating parameters
making this a more realistic test than
if we were to just crank the voltages up
as high as Staveley possible now while
our new PC is running Windows 10 I was
having serious driver issues when trying
to run the OS on my aging Hardware so I
reverted my old rig back to Windows 8.1
to ensure the systems of most stability
when testing fortunately the all-around
solid gaming performance in Windows 8.1
gave Microsoft little reason to further
optimize Windows 10 so this disparity in
our operating systems should prove more
or less negligible for our testing this
will change soon of course with the
ongoing development of DirectX 12 so
perhaps I'll do another experiment later
down the line once the Windows 10 API is
made widely available finally before we
take a look at our first benchmark I
should note that all gaming tests were
run at both 1920 by 1080 and 2560 by
1440 even though we're dealing with five
year old Hardware here my decision to
test at quad HD stems from the
looming pixel craze that's infiltrated
the display market in recent years with
the early adoption of 4k 21 by 9 and the
mainstream availability of quad HD
panels and this rapidly shifting trend
greatly affects how and when gamers
choose to upgrade their systems nowadays
users who may have been gaining
comfortably at 1080 for the last few
years are now starting to consider a
jump to high res displays so for those
of you who are in that same boat with an
aging desktop I've thrown in those quad
HD results to hopefully provide you some
deeper insight as to whether your system
is equipped to handle those extra pixels
but enough jibber-jabber let's kick off
our results with 3d mark firestrike
extreme the heavy synthetic benchmark
shows our 2016 system with a crushing 66
percent lead over our old desktop that's
quite a far away we've come in the last
half decade but certainly no surprise
when you consider the several node
shrinks and numerous architectural
refinements over the years while this
first glimpse of the generational gap is
quite telling we'll need to dig up more
than theoretical data to see what gaming
is like on a five-year-old desktop
taking a look at GTA 5 we used a blend
of high and very high quality settings
with no MSAA in order to keep our VRAM
usage within the GTX 670 S 2 gig frame
buffer still the overall quality of the
game was surprisingly detailed and far
from console territory and thanks to the
sheer scalability of GTA 5 our old PC
actually turns through quad HD fairly
well albeit with a low minimum frame
rate as you might expect the new PC
smoked my old rig performing about 47%
better at 1080 and a whopping 52 percent
faster at 1440 this higher performance
gain at quad HD is likely due to the GTX
970 having ample memory to handle the
vram eating monster that is GTA 5
nonetheless I'd consider this game to be
very playable on my aging Hardware even
beyond 1080 the unforgiving Metro last
light benchmark was run on Mac settings
with normal tessellation and here's
where we start to see our Sandy Bridge
system showing signs of age while our
2016 rig makes this test look like a
walk in the park
dear old sandy barely scrapes by a 1080
and absolutely collapses at quad-hd
demanding titles such as this one we'll
definitely need to be dialed down quite
a bit
if
sandi hopes to score any playable
framerates also it's pretty amazing to
see a nearly 80 percent performance
increase in this game just to GPU
generations later our poor desktop fared
slightly better in hitman absolution on
ultra with MSA a disabled topping 70 FPS
on average at Full HD though barely
staying afloat at 1440 no framerate dips
below 30 thank goodness but the gameplay
was starting to look a little choppy I
think we're beginning to see a trend
here that our 5-year old system just
isn't cutting it these days when it
comes to hypotenuses our final test in
battlefield 4 on ultra might as well be
my old pcs last nail in the coffin as
both 1080 and 1440 resolutions suffer
terribly with virtually unplayable frame
rates across the board even our modern
system gets weak in the knees here at
quad HD dialing down the in game
settings to medium or high would
probably give you a smooth experience at
1080 with the old system but bear in
mind that battlefield 4 is now three
years old which means it won't be long
before new triple-a titles with more
resource demand overwhelm the
capabilities of this old clunker and
that brings us to our big question of
the day folks is it time to upgrade your
5 6 7 8 or however many year old PC as
the answers to these broad questions
typically go it really just depends on
you in my case
today's testing showed that my old rig
is in no shape whatsoever to handle
resolutions beyond 1080 so if I've been
itching to experience quad HD or 4k
gaming this is definitely a factor for
me to consider if I'm perfectly
comfortable with gaming at 1080 and I
don't need to worry about my frame rates
are turning down my quality settings
right wrong more often than not there's
a chance that I'm not still playing the
same PC games that I was back in 2011 I
mean since then games have changed
they've gotten bigger and prettier and
more demanding than ever so
realistically I have to accept that my
once leading desktop is nowhere near as
powerful and capable as it used to be
whether or not it still performs well
enough for my liking is probably the
biggest question to answer when deciding
to upgrade so hypothetically speaking if
this was the only computer I owned right
now would I upgrade it today absolutely
because I'd want to see what gaming at
quad HD is like on a freesync monitor or
explore outer space with friends using a
VR headset edit 4k video like a boss or
simply treat myself to a smoother gaming
experience not to mention computer
hardware has never looked as badass as
it does today
whatever my reasons are for kissing my
old system goodbye you'll probably have
a different list entirely but I suppose
that's all part of what makes PCs so
wonderfully personal but let me know
what you guys think of the results we
saw today and don't forget to toss me a
