checked out LG's super UHD nano cell TV
and explored how it performed from a
gamers perspective spoiler alert it
performed well but it wasn't perfect
despite how much I loved the product
LG's local dimming technology at the
time left me wanting deeper black levels
and better contrast for games and other
content well jump ahead eight months and
the TV maker has released their 2018 new
super UHD TV with new features and
improvements addressing these issues so
today we'll be pitting LG against well
themselves to see if the new and
improved units has actually improved if
you're wondering how much has been
recycled from last year's model the
answer is a lot and that's not
necessarily a bad thing it just means LG
got a lot right the first time around
back again is the Nano cell LCD panel
that offers outstanding color accuracy
with a bright beautiful image that can
be appreciated with minimal distortion
from sharp viewing angles reducing the
number of bad seats in the living room
the screen delivers the same 4k image at
60 Hertz via 4 HDMI 2.0 ports still no
display port but that's cool
I don't care I don't care at all while
we're back here you also get three USB 2
ports optical out Ethernet 802 dot 11 AC
Wi-Fi and a 300 by 300 vase amount LG
rewards HDR connoisseurs with continued
support for HDR 10 and HL G with an
added feature called advanced HDR by
Technicolor that tone maps the image
based on the colourists company's
preferences for a natural appearance
that lets you watch TV and film content
as intended by the cinematographers how
good this filter actually looks in
practice though will largely depend on
the source content Dolby vision makes
its return but is now accompanied by
Dolby Atmos for immersive 3d sound
ideally when paired with a rockin
speaker system and not the built-in
drivers that get a solid net out of 10
like 2017 s model you can enable the
same game mode that effectively reduces
input lag for what's still one of the
best gaming experiences in the living
room solving the longtime issue of input
lag for gamers was a huge achievement
for LG last year but I was kind of
hoping to see more gaming centric
features on the new model to really take
things up a notch since last year LG
introduced their AI
Thank You brand which implements
artificial intelligence and deep
learning into a number of LG devices and
appliances that can talk to each other
and anticipate your needs like your ex
never could 28 teens model now serves as
a hub through which you can issue voice
commands to essentially boss your smart
home around like the hosts in Westworld
which as we all know turned out great
for everybody the built in webOS brings
together all the big video streaming
apps such as Netflix Amazon Hulu sling
TV and YouTube along with the web
browser here you can connect your Amazon
echo or your Google home which should
make searches in a thousand times better
than using an on-screen keyboard yeah
overall the UI is super clean and easy
to navigate with the familiar ganar moat
that's sure to please any kind of grip
as such I wouldn't recommend leaving it
alone with your wife now circling back
to last generations subpar black levels
in contrast new full array dimming
technology is advertised as having
solved much of the issue by controlling
more LED light zones the LEDs on the new
TV operate with a higher number of
dimming zones in order to reduce the
amount of edge bleed on lit objects this
in turn makes for a higher quality and
more natural looking image well we can
confidently say black levels and
contrast have been improved on the
latest model edge bleed has merely been
reduced and not eliminated you still get
a light to dark gradient on any black
bars and there's also a fairly prominent
halo effect when isolated light objects
are in front of a dark background the
average customer probably won't care or
even notice it while those more
sensitive to this kind of thing should
probably look into an OLED display if
their wallet allows at the time of
filming the brand's own 65 inch OLED
2018 model retails for about a thousand
bucks more than the $2,500 unit were
exploring today interestingly last
year's 65 inch nano cell model is
selling for half that price which is
definitely something to consider in
terms of quality you really can't go
wrong either way so at that point it
just boils down to the features you're
looking for and of course how much
you're willing to spend I'll drop some
links to the retail page and LG's
nano-cells Super Challenge campaign
video if you want to learn more but
that's all I got for now guys let me
know your thoughts on this one down
below and if it ticks all the boxes for
your ideal TV before you guys go feel
free to toss me a like on the video if
you enjoy it and get subscribed so you
don't
miss out til next time guys thank you so
much for watching have a good one and
I'll see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
