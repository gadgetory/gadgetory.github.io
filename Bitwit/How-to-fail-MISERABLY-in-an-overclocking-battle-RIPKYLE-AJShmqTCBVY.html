you probably caught wind of the whole
overclocking battle that's taking place
between Steve from gamers and exes and
Jay from Jays two cents and for a while
there Paul from Paul's hardware was was
also in the mix but I figured I would
try my hand at dialing in some over
clocks on my twenty ATT eyes that I have
set up in SLI behind me and just seeing
if I can get anywhere close to the
numbers that these guys have been
hitting so far hello hey Josh I left my
define s and r6 in the same room
together last night and now there's a
third case like what's going on baby let
me guess yeah actually wait hold on how
do two computer cases you know make a
baby you need to know how humans do it
first okay okay I gotta ask you guys do
you like touch dust filters or something
is Lube even non-conductive is there
thermal paste involved and if so you
know where does it go now staying silent
okay good talk just wrap it up next time
we're running out of space the define us
to from fractal design features front
panel USB see ample water cooling
support and a clean interior layout for
your next custom build click the link
below to learn more the two main reasons
for why I'm not expecting to beat any of
their scores is one because they've been
doing this they've been at this for
several days if not a week now just
refining their methodologies and testing
and tweaking their settings for their
overclocks and stuff whereas this is
basically day one for me trying to
actually overclock competitively so I
definitely have a long way to catch up
and the second reason is because I only
have twenty atti founders Edition cards
which are still great cards I mean they
are factory overclocked and they do run
faster than some of the board partner
cards out there which is still kind of
weird but I believe JN ste
both have access to custom variants of
these cards that have custom PCBs and
better power delivery which will help
them achieve higher overclock perhaps
than what these cards will be able to so
for those reasons and a couple others I
don't think I'll be hitting number one
on any leaderboards today but like I
said this is just for the walls I'm just
gonna have fun jumping into the 4a and I
also was kind of curious to see what
kind of home-brewed method I could come
up with for cooling all the hardware
behind me so let's check that out now
all right so this is my sort of
Frankenstein of a cooling setup it's not
quite as elaborate or sizable as Jays
but it's all about how you use it
all right ladies so here's a blower fan
right this is actually pulled from our
server room keeps our server cool so
hopefully the server's alright right now
so I'm gonna be cranking that up to the
its highest setting it does get pretty
loud so be warned and you can see the
end of the fan is kind of piped into
this styrofoam cooler that I plan to
fill up with water and dry ice that's
right we're going dry ice because we
don't have an a/c like Jay so we kind of
have to make our own in a sense on the
other side of the cooler you can see
that we've got sort of a bridge here and
using duct tape the whole way just make
an airtight seal more or less and that
bridge leads right into this sort of
it's actually the Vega Vega 64 box that
AMD sent a while back but you can see
I've kind of cut that up and used it as
a shroud to go over our 220 ATT is just
concentrates all that cool air as you
might have guessed I'm using the same
CPU as Jay and Steve for this little
battle which is the 79 80 XC which I
read elated it was originally deleted by
Steve himself it's kind of ironic that
I'm using it against him now but i
deleted it myself a couple days ago and
reapplied liquid metal just because the
temperatures were kind of funky there
will be a dedicated video coming on that
pretty soon and you can see I've got an
ek waterblock on it right now I actually
stole the tubes from my ek predator and
it's going to this standalone radiator
which is going to be in an ice bath but
the ice melted because I put it in a
while ago but I will be refilling that
that's of course hooked up to a pump
pump res and that's that's just a radio
that I mounted the the pump to for
stability it's not actually active as
you can see so there's my cooling setup
guys it's pretty shoddy like I said it's
nothing fancy I have no idea how it's
going to do but I guess that's all part
of the fun right so
alright I'm ready to drop some ice in
here sorry it's a little noisy in here
I've got the fan running at full speed
but we're just about ready to run fire
strike ultra I have overclocked both of
the r-tx 28 et eyes I hope it's stable I
haven't done a ton of stability testing
for the the settings that I just put in
here
I guess this first run in fire strike
ultra will let us know so I'm gonna go
ahead and start it now
idle temps right off the bat on the GPUs
aren't quite as impressive as I was
hoping they'd be we're getting like 30
to 35 C on both cards right for a
culture underway
system just shut down like before the
run even started right is the the
loading bar finished and it was about to
start the system just just killed itself
please standby all right here we go red
number 2 let's do it I'm feeling lucky
this time
he crashed it reset again something
seriously wrong that overclock should
have should have been fine so I
initially tried a one hundred and fifty
megahertz offset on the core clock
didn't even touch the memory power and
temp target were completely maxed out
and for some reason that did not hold so
I dialed it back down to 125 megahertz
offset on the core clock and still
system shutdown so now I'm gonna go to a
hundred megahertz I'm not even gonna
touch our memory just to see if our
cards are really that sensitive alright
let's try this again
guess what the system just did again all
right well you may have noticed that my
test bed looks a little bit different
than it just did a moment ago and my
cooling solution is also about 10% of
what it was that's because for some
reason the motherboard I was using which
is the x2 99 or prime x2 99 deluxe from
asus was just not working properly I'm
boiling it down to a motherboard issue
because the CPU and the graphics card
still seemed to work just fine in our
new test bed here which didn't take long
at all to set up after that whole ordeal
this is the Auris gaming 9
also x2 99 and of course we have our fan
here but we've done away with the dry
ice solution because it just wasn't
working I love I love today and I'm
gonna also stick with our ice bucket
here even though I need to replenish the
ice because it's melted once again I saw
you move don't do it don't you dare
think about it I should really just get
a better stand for that Oh God
okay just taking it off for now just
just for this clip so another issue I
just had I'm on a freaking roll right
now is that while I was taking the 79 80
XE out of the old test bed the IHS came
loose which makes sense because again I
deleted this processor just days ago and
I didn't permanently reseal it with like
silicone or anything like that so it
came undone and I was pretty careful
with it too it just happened to pop off
and it slid in such a way where some
liquid metal got on certain parts of the
substrate where it doesn't belong
fortunately didn't touch any capacitors
or anything like that but I did still
have to spend twenty to thirty minutes
to make sure all the liquid metal was
off of every part of that CPU apart from
the die and now ever since then I've
been having a really hard time getting
back to the clock speed that I was
overclocked at on the old test bed with
this new one which was I'll just tell
you what I was running at because it
doesn't even matter anymore it's a total
shit show anyway 4.8 gigahertz is what I
was running on the last test bench which
was at one point three four volts and
now I'm having a hard time hitting 4.7
gigahertz with even a little bit more
voltage than I was using before so I
don't know if it's just some degradation
that I'm experiencing similar to J with
his chip after just pumping so much
voltage into that CPU over and over
again or if something else happened what
in the process of me putting that IHS
back on at any rate things are not going
my way today so for the sake of this
video I'm gonna push on and dial it
whatever settings will actually hold
just so I can get one at least one full
run of fire strike ultra and whatever
score that spits out no matter how
terrible it is
that'll be my baseline score for day one
that's all I can offer you guys right
now so let's just get this over with do
some angry overclocking
alright another awesome update it's
actually a lot worse than I thought not
only are we unable to hit that 4.8
gigahertz overclock on this new testbed
but we can't even do anything in fact
right now we're running bone stock on
our CPU and like what happens when I try
to run Cinebench system shuts down this
tells me that there's probably some
liquid metal still on the substrate
maybe touching one of the capacitors and
at any first sign of load it's just
protecting itself and shutting down so
I'm gonna have to revisit the 79 80 XE
again but that will obviously have to
come at a later time so for now let's
just pop in our backup Study 960 X 16
core pretty much the next best thing
obviously not quite an 18 core but I I'm
so desperate at this point I don't even
care alright we swapped out the stupid
processor for one that's hopefully less
stupid still running stock I'm gonna see
if Cinebench works and it does oh thanks
sweet Jesus okay I guess I can start
overclocking this guy finally hopefully
there will be no issues between now and
the time I returned to you oh look the
system is no longer wanting to boot from
the drive the only connected drive that
has windows on it and I can't even
freaking the keyboard doesn't work now
keyboard not working I already tried all
the different USB ports on the rear i/o
this is my waking nightmare
anyone have any water cyanide maybe okay
okay alright so
I just I want to rip my hair out and
scream right now there's something going
on with the hardware
I can't even overclock our 79 60 X to 4
point 3 gigahertz that's that's
ridiculous and we have plenty of cooling
for it too and the way it's crashing is
just so bizarre it just shuts down
instantly the graphics cards have been
acting suspiciously - I mean even with a
100 megahertz offset we've been seeing
Jay and Steve and even Paul getting off
sets well beyond that and yet it just
seems to crash everything that I throw
at it for for no apparent reason
that I can tell right now I'm gonna do
something right now that I haven't even
done yet which is basically try to run
fire strike ultra one time fully stock
both a CPU GPU memory let's just see if
we can get through one run I've been at
this for way too long - it's been about
10 hours and I have so little to show
for all this time that I've invested so
it's it's very frustrating okay it looks
like our run is actually finishing with
a score of 14 thousand three hundred and
eighty a graphic score of fourteen
thousand five hundred and seven
definitely a long way off from Jays top
score which is reaching 17,000 something
but it's a score it's a starting point
and I guess we can only go up from here
maybe I think I encountered more
technical issues today than I have in
the last six months combined I
definitely underestimated just what a
challenge it is to go up against these
wicked scores that Steve and Jay have
put up and so kudos to them you know
they've been working hard and they
deserve to be up there on the top of the
leaderboard where I'm still just trying
to find my footing here with all this so
before I embarrass myself any further
I'm gonna get out of here I've got
things to do like contemplate my life
choices and cry in a corner whilst in a
fetal position for the next 10 hours
it's been fun no it hasn't
there's got to be a part to fall up to
this video because there's no way I
could let this end in the utter
catastrophe it has become so I guess
that means you should subscribe to the
channel so you don't miss that fast like
on this video if you enjoyed it or if
you just feel sorry for me that works -
that's all for now thanks for watching
I'm gonna get out of here and do the
thing I do best in times like these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
