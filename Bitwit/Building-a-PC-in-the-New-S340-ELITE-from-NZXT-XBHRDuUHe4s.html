channel today I'm checking out a brand
new case from NZXT this is their s340
elite and if you're watching this video
on the day of upload that means this
case just launched today hey brand news
it's hot so obviously as the name
suggests this is working off of or this
is an iteration I should say of the
original s340 already a very popular
critically acclaimed case so there have
been some much-needed improvements of
that case with the elite version and
we're going to be going over that today
now retail price first off MSRP in the
US is $99.99 let's just call it a
hundred dollars flat comes in full matte
black there's not another freakin color
on this thing it's just pure black I
love it it's like the monolith from 2001
Space Odyssey
however they are gonna be releasing a
matte white and a matte black and red
version later this month so stay tuned
for that if that's more your thing but I
personally like the all black finish
still get the very same simple and sleek
minimalistic design looks beautiful
nothing really on the front it's just
ooh slab NZXT logo on the bottom on the
back you've got a 120mm your fan mount
with the included fan right there of
course seven expansion slots and a power
supply bracket with thumb screws for
removable easy entry of your power
supply however look at this little power
supply filter dust filter that doesn't
suck the s340 the predecessor had a dead
jack for a dust filter it just had
it just had the screen there was no like
casing around it there was no frame it
was just a flimsy flimsy old screen held
in by little tiny latches with horrible
this one's on a rail system it's not
magnetic but it still gets the job done
very nice improvement there and of
course the one that's probably been
glaring you in the face since this video
started is the gorgeous tempered glass
side panel this thing is 100% tempered
glass there's no plastic or anything on
here there is some black trim there's
some black colored trim to match and
blend in with the edges of the chassis
itself but other than that left to right
top to bottom 100% visibility of the
inside of your chassis so none of your
hard work that goes on inside of the
case goes unnoticed makes me very
nervous but it's also very beautiful to
look at so good on you mates for that
NZXT you get four thumb screws to attach
it to there very securely with the the
indents for a Phillips head screwdriver
always nice to see on the very bottom
you get the same four feet with the
rubber bottoms that you saw on the
predecessor
as well so it elevates your case now on
the top of the case there are some
interesting things here now apart from
the 120 or 140 mm your fan mount which
they do include a 120 here that's 120
right yep that's 120 which is set to
exhaust I would recommend intake because
there's no dust filter on the top here
you do get some very nicely updated
front panel connectors to make your
gaming desktop experience that much more
simplistic and efficient particularly
for VR so when we go down that apart
from your headphone and mic jacks you
also get 2 USB 2.0 2 USB 3.0 and in HDMI
port so there is an HDMI pass-through
cable inside this case with an HDMI port
at the top so you can actually plug in a
VR headset which is so much nicer if you
guys are early adopters you have an HTC
vive or an oculus rift for instance you
know that it's a pain in the butt to
fish around the back of your case to
constantly plug it in and and unplug it
whenever you're not using it because a
VR headset is not a peripheral that just
stays on your desk Ahana percent of the
time you pull it out when you're ready
to use it or you pack it up and you wrap
it up when you're when you're done with
it boo boo
so the HDMI port on the front of the
case makes it much easier to get in and
out of your VR experience and they've
also included this very handy magnetic
cable management puck I've never seen
one of these before
it actually comes apart so what this
does is it slaps to the the front your
case like so basically you can wrap up
your your cable length all the cable
length from coming from your stupid VR
headset can just wrap around that thing
and then you can either put the VR
headset on top of your case which maybe
I would recommend because the matte
finish while it's not very thick or
fingerprint prone can scratch a bit
easily so maybe you could just hang the
VR VR headset straight onto the puck or
you can just keep it on your desk area
either way a very elegant and classy
solution for wrapping up them cables but
also keeping your VR equipment nearby
when you're ready to use them and the
reason why the puck splits apart is so
if you have an extra lengthy cable you
have more room to wrap it up with handy
now obviously at this point you guys can
tell that this is not a standard
scripted review of mine in any way
instead I thought it would be kind of
cool a little bit different to actually
just do a hands-on bill with the s340
elite get my hands dirty a little bit so
to speak and just kind of document along
the way what works for me and what
doesn't with this you case so I think
it's gonna be fun excited I think this
bill is gonna look pretty badass by the
end of it I just kind of scrambled
scrounged around for some hardware in my
room but it's looking pretty good I
think it's gonna look really good on
that little tempered glass in the side
paneling Oh
all right let's build the crap out of
this thing all right so I have removed
the side panel and them instilling the
motherboard so the s340 elite has
pre-installed standoffs and the the
center standoff is actually a raised
post many of you guys are familiar with
that just helps you to Center the board
and keep it in place just like so while
you install the rest of your standoff
screws tape you're cool I'm gonna go
ahead and bolt this board down make sure
it's nice and snug now on to the
radiator installation we're gonna have
to pop this front panel off comes off
just like so it's got a couple latches
that easily allow you to remove it and
replace it also just like the old s340
you've got tons of ventilation at the
top and bottom here so even though it
gives off a really enclosed look it
looks super sleek doesn't look like much
airs getting through there but there
actually is it's coming through both
sides of the chassis that way
and then you've also got a magnetic dust
filter a very long one full-frontal
filtration very nice now a couple
mounting options at the front here you
can do to 120s or up to two one 140s so
we've got again to a 280 millimeter
radiator here however the caveat of the
s 340 and the elite as well you can't
install the radiator first you have to
install the fans first and then the
radiator because there's just not enough
clearance to install the radiator first
due to the the front IO connectivity up
here it's actually blocking this rather
a long radiator so we're gonna have to
do is install the fans first so that can
be that can be a bummer if that's not
exactly the configuration you were
looking for I was hoping to see maybe
that NZXT had done something about that
with the elite version but nay
oh I'm stalling these fans the wrong way
damn it Kyle you never built a computer
before so I'm gonna go hoses at the top
of the case from here on out she kind of
just screw you just screw your way to
victory
I should also mention that there's
plenty of cutouts behind these fans here
to route your fan cables through to the
backside of the case there's a look at
the front and we're not quite done with
the front yet we shouldn't be replacing
the front panel on just yet because
we're going to install the hard drive
next and you actually need access to
this area right here in order to mount
that so all right we've got a single two
terabyte WD black that route stalling
here I'm just going to slide that in
like so there's a two two bays for three
and a half inch drives and these are
just straight-up bare-bones there's no
rubber anti-vibration padding of any
kind this I mean this looks like it
could have been from like a 50 dollar
case or something it's pretty it's
pretty minimal here and you're probably
asking yourself well why even though why
are you doing this storage right now it
seems kind of early in the build do
storage well therein lies potentially
another shortcoming of this case and
I'll show you that right here alright so
here's the hard drive from the other
angle and normally in a typical build I
would install the power supply first
before ever touching the storage but in
this particular scenario you can see you
just saw me a screw in two two screws
from this side of the hard drive but
there's a third one that we got to get
on the right on the right side in order
to get that one we kind of got to like
put our hand in here and dig around for
it it's not the easiest screw to get in
there you kind of have to look and block
the camera a little bit and there you go
so as you can see I'm really using all
the clearance I can get from my hand to
be able to access this screw here you
can see I've also switched to a shorter
screw driver in order to make that that
connection there so having a power
supply installed first would have made
things a little bit more difficult
especially with certain cables sticking
out as it is not fully modular the unit
that we're using today now another
edition that NZXT is added to the s 340
with the elite version is that you now
get an SSD mount at the front of your
case right on the wall of your power
supply shroud you still get the two that
are on top of the power supply shroud
with beautiful cutouts so you can route
your SATA cables through however you've
also got this one on the front here
which is much more visible through your
tempered glass side panel and you've got
a little cutout here to route your
cables to the right of that SSD
however those cables if you're going to
be mounting your SSD there also need to
pass through this hard drive cage for
your three and a half inch mechanicals
so if you were to have an SSD mounted at
the front and a second mechanical hard
drive in this cage well you would kind
of be blocking any SATA cables from that
SSD because there's really not much room
for them to pass through at this point
with the two of the drive slots occupied
so what you would have to do is probably
either install the SSD somewhere else
but if you really want to show it off
and you want to have it in that slot
you could slot your second mechanical
drive at the mounting point at the very
bottom of the case so you do have three
potentially potentially three slots or
three mounting positions for your three
and a half inch drives and this is
pretty much at the very floor of the
chassis you would have to basically turn
the case on its side and bolt in or
screw in this drive from the very bottom
it also supports a two and a half inch
drive down there so in total you get
three three and a half inch drive mounts
as well as four SSD maps to on top of
the power supply shroud one at the front
of the power supply shroud or on the
side of it I should say and one at the
very bottom of the case next up is the
power supply installation which is
pretty straightforward you've got this
bracket at the back that I mention it
with you thumb screws comes out really
easily like so mount the bracket to the
power supply shove all the cables in
first through the back of the case you
want to make sure that the power supply
is facedown of the fan is facedown on
that power supply because you do want to
take advantage of that dust filter there
isn't really much ventilation at the top
of that power supply shroud so you would
be starving your power supply for
airflow if you mounted it the other way
and then you just screw in the thumb
screws voila
but a baton but a boom but a boom now
we're going to go ahead and install our
SSD here I've chosen this position
because it's unique to the elite version
of the s3 40 so what I
to do is first undo the mounting plate
with this thumb screw single thumb screw
love that it's just one screw it deal
with so here's the mounting plate we're
going to go ahead and screw the SS key
to the plate just like that and then
before we replace the mounting plate
with the SSD attached what I like to do
is actually route to my SATA cables
through the hole first so there's the
data cable power cable is oh boy yeah
alright and I like to connect these
first to the SSD before I install the
plate back to the case just makes a
little bit easier you can kind of
already bend the cables ahead of time
knowing which way they're going to need
to turn line up plate with the notches
on the case and replace that thumb screw
done so now I think we're ready to start
connecting and routing all of our cables
in the system starting with the a i/o
we're going to route our power and fan
connectors through here so you can see
I'm routing it through a cutout that's
directly above the motherboard it's a
pretty spacious cutout it's got room to
pass some through you've also got
another nice big cut out by your 8 pin
EPS connector here by the CPU they're
not grommeted but they are pretty damn
high up there on the case so they're
pretty much out of sight doesn't bother
me too much
as far as our USB 2 connector for the
pump or I'm sorry for the software
support for this this kraken we're just
going to route it through it just routed
it through the one of the two cutouts
that's on the power supply shroud these
cutouts are for little connectors like
that your front panel connectors which
we're going to connect right now as well
as the two SSDs that would go on your
power supply shroud there and God said
let there be sound and he plugged in the
HD audio connector 8-pin EPS into house
here comes the 24 pin ATX motherboard
power connector which I'm passing right
underneath the cable management bar
which is a familiar familiar feature
from the original s340
you guys remember that this bar right
here it actually has a pump mount here
as well for custom water cooling but
this is a really nice solution that just
offers a really clean aesthetic while
hiding all the cables that we'll be
plugging into the side of your
motherboard like like your 24 pin ATX
your USB 3.0 which on the Maximus 8
formula is actually a right-angle
connector so I think it actually works
out better with this particular cable
management system set K by the one and
other SATA cable now one thing I want to
point out about this cable management
bar is that well it does a really nice
job of concealing a lot of the
motherboard cables here that plug in to
this side of the board it simultaneously
blocks your radiator and it kind of
limits the clearance of your front
radiator support so for example I could
not do a push-pull configuration right
now because this cable bar would be in
the way there's just no physical way to
get another two fans on here
even even at this lower section where
the bar doesn't protrude quite as much
this it's still covering up these these
two screw holes here on the radiator so
that's kind of a bummer if you want to
do some custom water cooling what you're
probably going to want a thicker
radiator than what's on the Kraken x61
but unfortunately you're gonna have to
remove this cable bar which I believe it
is removable yes there's one two three
four five I don't know five or six
screws holding it in place which seems
like a lot I don't know why there's so
many damn screws holding it in place I
mean it's also providing some structural
integrity to the chassis so perhaps
that's why it's got so many screws in it
but you would have to remove this if you
wanted to expand on the front radiator
solution of your particular built so
bear that in mind then I forget about
these front panel connectors didn't you
well I didn't get ready to install our
video card now we've got this little
metal plate at the back of the case
that's held in place with two thumb
screws easily comes off just gives you
better access to the other thumb screws
holding your expansion slots in place
you do I hate it when manufacturers
tighten thumb screws to the point where
you need a screwdriver just seems
counterintuitive
damnit I just realized I installed the
wrong PCI slot Samba batch here we go
alright so we've got a gtx 1080 here
founders edition i'm sorry this is a
1070 nambas Edition which is about a 10
inch card I believe so obviously you can
go probably twelve maybe even 13 inches
whoa on the graphics card length if you
so wished so yeah I mean you can install
pretty much any length graphics card for
the most part if you're gonna be rocking
a similar setup as this bear in mind
however if you were to remove the cable
management bar and have like a super
fatty push/pull radiator at the front of
your case that is going to limit how
long your graphics card can be due to
dududududududu cable management time so
here's our first look at the business
end where all the cable management takes
place and first off there's a pretty
large CPU cooler cut out here so you
could replace your CPU cooler without
having to uninstall your entire
motherboard you could just access the
the CPU cooler backplate from this area
right here which is very very convenient
and you've also got a lot of tie down
points that you can see strewn about the
case which is also very handy however
one of the big improvements here on the
backside over the original s340 are
these cable clasps right here located
here here here and here you get four of
them in total and they are incredibly
handy this is probably my favorite I
don't know a favorite cable management
solution in a case I like this more than
cable ties tie-down points you know
velcro straps all that sort of thing
these are pretty freakin sweet the only
complaint that I have here is that they
feel a little bit on the cheap side
especially when you open them all the
way it kind of feels like the plastic
gets really weak as soon as you open it
you know any anywhere past about this
point which makes you a little bit
concerned it kind of like I don't know
it causes a little bit of concern while
you're building which is never a great
thing I haven't had any problems with
them snapping or breaking however I've
just started building with it right now
if you were to do three or four builds
in the case like this would these wear
out over time and eventually maybe snap
off possibly I don't know but from the
looks of it they do that they do a great
job they just feel a little bit
it on the economical side and I don't
really want to test them too much
further but why don't we go ahead and
start wrapping things up here with the
cable management of course you have
plenty of space right in front of the
power supply of course your mileage will
vary if you have a really lengthy power
supply you might not have as much free
space down here for storing excess
cables oh look what's that
that's the HDMI pass-through beautiful I
have never seen one of these in the case
before I guess there's a first for
everything so that's kind of cool
of course our our founders Edition card
does not support HDMI on the front there
so we're going to tuck that away for now
and I'm just going to go ahead and wrap
up the rest of this stuff with the help
of these handy cable clasps you know
what in fact we actually have so much
freaking room for cables back here that
I'm going to add some of these
extensions
oh hello SATA hello say that would you
like to meet my other SATA port we can
have a SATA party crazy Express
sometimes you're so expressive now for
your PCIe cables that power your GPU you
do still have that cut out on the power
supply shroud if you want to write it
straight from the bottom there
however personal preference of mine I
still like routing mine from the side
here peeking out through the cable
management bar and then we've got fans
bitches these cable ties make it super
easy to remove or add any cables to the
bunch with just like zero effort at all
I mean I haven't spent any time I've
barely spent any time on cable
management in this case and it looks it
looks like I have so that's that's
definitely saying something
and just like that our build in the s340
elite is pretty much complete but there
is one more thing that i want to talk
about before we close up the video and I
give my closing thoughts on the case is
this new product this other product that
just launched with NZXT this is their
internal USB hub it's a USB 2.0 hub so
something like this would come in real
handy where you'd actually plug this
into your motherboard 2.0 header along
with some DC to molex power
I do wish this was SATA that would be I
would have been clutch guys that
would've been super clutch but then
basically expands your USB 2.0
connectivity of course the the the lead
that goes to your motherboard connects
to this white port here and then you've
got three additional headers three USB
2.0 internal headers as well as to
external headers so this is just great
for things like you know a i/o liquid
coolers for example or lighting
accessories fan controllers all that
sort of thing the best part about this
probably my favorite is that it's
completely magnetic so if we turn the
camera up here so check this out boom
how about this boom one more boom yeah
you get it it's a magnet so it sticks to
pretty much any magnetic surface in your
case which makes it really easy to just
store away in your build of course you
wouldn't be able to put it here for
example because it wouldn't have enough
clearance for the side panel to go back
on but if you wanted to store it say
underneath your power supply shroud the
bag that's pretty much do all the work
you don't have to like bust out any
cable ties or velcro straps to to
restrain it to make sure it doesn't get
tossed around it pretty much just stays
in place with that magnetic feature
pretty cool I'll leave a link to this
guy in the description below if you guys
want more info on if you need to
future-proof your cases for a USB 2.0
connectivity you need some additional
expansion it's a pretty handy feature or
a tool to have I should say but on that
note this bill is complete so we're
gonna go ahead and slap the side panel
back on and close this video out so here
she is everybody all decked out but the
side panel slept on there and I will say
with the tempered glass
it really breathes new life into the
s340
it just looks amazing in person I don't
know how how good it looks to you guys
on camera but it just looks phenomenal
in my opinion you can just really see a
lot more of the the system itself it
just tempered glass just there's no
comparison compared to
acrylic or plexi so good on you guys at
NZXT for that upgrade there's just so
many little improvements that really add
up to make this a much better case than
the original including those cable
management clasps at the back even
though they're a little on the cheapy
side they still do a great job at
keeping everything nice and tidy the
side panel on the back Flint on like
super easy no problem there
also the the SSD mount there were a
couple cons here right the SSD mount at
the front while I do like this new
implementation I think it looks
fantastic having an SSD right behind the
tempered glass you do have to route the
SSD cables through that three and a half
inch mechanical drive Bay which can
cause issues if you wanted to populate
both of those slots however I did notice
there's a small cutout to the left of
the SSD which you could route your SSD
cables through there but it looks like
you would have to flip your SSD upside
down and no one wants to really display
their SSD in that inverted position so
that's kind of a moot point there also
the cable management bar still brings
home all the same great assets that it
did in the original case however it's
just in the way if you wanted to expand
on the radiator solution that you see
here if you want anything thicker than a
1520 millimeter radiator or you want to
do push-pull for example you would have
to remove that cable management bar but
that bar is such a crucial element in
terms of aesthetics and feature set to
the s3 the s3 40 line that would be kind
of a shame to have to remove it for any
reason at all also mad props to the
updated dust filter for the power supply
that's a huge improvement as well and
last but not least you guys probably
noticed the oculus rift that's hanging
on the front of this case utilizing that
magnetic cable management puck which
actually did have two separate because
to wrap the full length of that cord
it's a pretty long cable and also
utilizing that front panel HDMI port
which if you guys are into VR you're
planning on building a vr gaming system
this is the next case to get until more
competitive options at this price point
rollout with similar VR oriented
features because it's just it's perfect
for this sort of thing so all together
