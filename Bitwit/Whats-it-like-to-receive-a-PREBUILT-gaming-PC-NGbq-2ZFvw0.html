the channel hope you're all doing well
today we're doing something a little bit
different we're going to be checking out
this pre-built
desktop from the folks over at Origin PC
they are a very well-known and reputable
boutique system builder and there's
admittedly a lot of controversy around
these types of high-end gaming pre-built
and I think one of the main reasons for
that is that you can often build your
own system in identical system for a lot
cheaper and I think while that's true
most of the time there's a lot of cases
where that is true there are still a
number of benefits that you might
receive when going with a company like
Origin PC we're going to be talking
about that today more specifically I
wanted to bring you guys along for the
experience of what it's like to receive
one of these high-end gaming desktops
because this is my first experience
personally I've never even seen one of
these or checked one of these out myself
so it should be it should be a fun
experience for me hopefully you guys
enjoyed the ride along with me and we'll
be testing it out we'll be firing it up
to see if there's any sort of software
that's pre-installed that we need to
know about what the gaming experience is
like if it's just as overclockable and
just as fast as a regular DIY system
that you might build yourself including
what it all comes with you know the
accessories and things like that first
off though before I get ahead of myself
I did want to plug the giveaway that's
currently ongoing with fractal design
and the folks over at Origin PC to win
this exact system right here this is a
$3,800 rig they're neuron system
featuring a 7700 K core i7 from Intel
and 2 GTX 1080p eyes in sli if you want
the full specs and details on how to
enter go ahead and follow the link in
the description below on that note guys
let's go ahead and talk about what comes
with this package so first off the
system itself came in a nice big wooden
box we actually needed a screwdriver or
a power drill to get it open but it was
really simple after that and it also
comes included with the shirt you get a
nice origin pc shirt we've also got what
looks to be a bag of power supply cables
for our EBG a power supply that's inside
the system and look at that Wow these
are some really nice custom sleeve
cables these are not extensions these
are straight cables that go directly
from the power supply to the various
components and it's pretty much that we
got the whole game here SATA VGA
ts just molex all around and this sort
of reminds me that with a prebuilt like
this at least they're using all standard
universal form factor components meaning
you could upgrade and expand the system
however you want at any time and they've
clearly given you enough cables to do
that so for example if you wanted to
swap out the GPUs later down the line
that required different PCIe plugs
you're pretty much covered with this
patch of cables and don't quote me on
this but they look like they might be
with what the word paracord paracord
sleeving I'm not exactly sure if that's
what this is whatever it is it's really
nice so I'm sure most users will be
happy with the quality there and then
we've got this Origin PC box which I
would imagine is filled with some
motherboard accessories we've got our AC
cable of course yes motherboard
accessories like the Wi-Fi antenna for
the motherboard we've got you know SLI
bridges extra SATA cables and things
like that a USB flash drive 16 gig
kingston flash drive which is USB 3
that's nice a little USB 3 flash back I
would imagine there's some drivers on
here just for backup
we'll see once we boot the system up and
that's it guys that's very simple it
doesn't come included with a bunch of
crap you don't need like stupid posters
that are folded up 30 times they look
terrible so it's pretty much just the
essentials which is already a good sign
so why don't we go ahead and boot this
guy up for the very first time and see
what we find on the desk
alright first boot wasn't success here
we are in the ACS UEFI of the Z 270g
gaming motherboards asus rog Strix model
and let's see here we've got to get some
overclock settings it looks like folks
over at origin have already dialed us in
a nice XMP profile for our memory ddr4
2667 very nice they've also done an all
core overclock on our 7700 k to 5
gigahertz beautiful and yeah it's
looking pretty good in here nothing that
I wouldn't do myself honestly if I had
built this myself adaptive mode that's
good so we're not wasting unnecessary
power when we're in idling States so
beautiful this is looking pretty good
I'm going to go ahead and boot into the
desktop now check out our Windows
environment so here we are right off the
bat something tells me that this is not
a default Windows 10 background looks
like origins had some fun here on the
desktop you'll find icons such as this
PC recycle bin and PDF Origin PC readme
let's open it up see what they have to
say here we've got a little thank-you
and welcome message here some notes
about included accessories ok so
apparently the flash drive that comes
included is has a system image on it not
drivers so forgive me for that some
other notes about overclocked processors
liquid-cooled desktops
this is pretty cool 24/7 lifetime
hotline at 187 7 origin 0 or you can
contact them via email support at Origin
PC comm I really think this is one of
the big selling points about buying a
prebuilt rig from a boutique system
builder you have this constant lifeline
of tech support there's only one company
that you have to go through regardless
of what happens with your rig if the
CPUs bad or if the memory goes bad
there's something wrong with the GPU the
case it doesn't matter you just have one
contact for all of that stuff on the
other end of the spectrum if you build
your own system you're pretty much
responsible for troubleshooting
everything yourself which most of us are
comfortable with on you know all the
viewers of this channel I'd say a lot of
us are really tech savvy enough to go in
there and troubleshoot things ourselves
but not everyone has the know-how and
especially not everyone has the time to
fiddle around with their systems so for
users who prefer to not get their hands
dirty when it comes to servicing their
rigs
I mean origin is just a call away and
offer support in a moment's notice which
is really handy last little bit of
information here it says all important
items will be located in the sea Origin
PC folder we've got some recommended
apps in there go ahead and check that
out here we can see we've got our o they
actually hooked it up with a 500 gig
samsung 960 Evo holy prep it actually
said on the spec sheet I was given it
said a 250 gig but hey guys if you're
entering that giveaway 500 gig nvme SSD
holy crap that's really nice and of
course a 4 terabyte WD black but ok they
said that the important files would be
in C Origin PC which is right here so
we've got origin logos yada yada yada
recommended apps cpu-z beautiful
hardware monitor so some nice monitoring
apps for temperatures and frequencies
and things like that web root and origin
team View origin team view I would
imagine is if they need to actually
service your your system for you and
they need to remote in so they can take
control of your desktop and help you out
and see what you're seeing
that's actually really handy so let's
let's take a look at some of these some
of these some of datas let's take a look
at some Zeta is right here ZB u Z all
right so we're probably not going to see
the 5 gigahertz reading right now just
for a second there when we when we let
it up because we're in adaptive mode
right so it's only going to hit 5 5
gigahertz consistently once we put a
load on to the CPU ah that's cool you
can see here we've got some memory
running at the rated 26 66 megahertz
dual channel 32 gigs ddr4 absolutely
beautiful and hardware monitor sorry if
it's a little tiny on the screen guys
sorry sorry sorry
and then hardware monitor errs let's
take a look at some tampered shares here
idling temps we are currently rocking
anywhere from the high 20s to low 40s I
mean it's bouncing all over the place
but mostly in the 20 high 20s I would
say we're idling in the high 20s it's
very nice it's super chilly in here as
well
I should mention ambient is probably
around 21 22 C but you know what guys
know what I want to do now I want to see
if origin pc actually overclocked our
graphics cards as well so I've installed
MSI Afterburner
I've got two instances of GPUs e running
one for each of our cards the one on the
left is the top card the one on the
right is the bottom card so I'm going to
fire the soup or
mara hey hey hey it looks like this has
already been fiddled with power in temps
lighters are maxed out and there's
already been a 120 megahertz core clock
offset and memory clock offset input
into the system into the into the
software here so it looks like maybe
afterburner was already installed I just
didn't know about it at any rate it
looks like we're already running
overclocked with our GT X 1080 Ti so
that's pretty cool and of course I would
imagine that your ma your mileage is
going to vary based on the type of
configuration and loadout that you go
with with origin key see some of those
systems might be overclocked fully the
other other ones might not be I'm not
exactly sure but it looks like ours is
those CPU and GPU seem to have gotten
some treatment some love from the origin
pc guys so we've got Unigine Heaven 4.0
running right here and we're just going
to keep an eye on these temperatures
first off it actually all of our data
here core clock is currently at 1960 one
point five megahertz on both cards
temperatures are arising slowly but
surely alright so it's been a couple
minutes now and the system is has
definitely gotten a bit louder it's not
overwhelmingly loud though it's nothing
that would blow your ears out especially
if you're wearing headphones or
listening to in-game audio through the
speakers or something like that but it
is they're taking a look at the
temperatures on the bottom card we've
got a GPU temp of 86 C and the top card
is running at 89 C we're almost hitting
90 degrees on the top video card it's
kind of a shame that that it's a micro
ATX board and we're unable to put an
additional slot between the two cards
that would open up just a little bit
more airflow I think for the top fan but
what can you do tis the form factor and
then we've also got what's even more
concerning though is the GPU load we're
pretty much at 100% load on the bottom
card but on the top card we're getting
anywhere from 70 to 85 85 degrees 85 %
GPU utilization and also under the
performance cap reason which gives us an
explanation of why performance might be
capped at any given point I was seeing
the thermal icon pop up indicating that
we're running into some thermal
limitations with this top card so that
could also explain why our GPU load is
less than ideal but why don't we go
ahead and play some games of this
I think we should fire up some games by
the way still at 1920 by 1080 in Unigine
Heaven 4.0 we're still getting over 200
FPS just just just putting that out all
right here we are in GTA 5 one of two
games that were going to be trying out
today I just wanted to give you guys a
quick rundown of these settings we're
using 4k alright
no vsync obviously everything's maxed
out with the exception of msaa being at
2x that's also the goes for the
reflection msaa
but everything else is completely maxed
out alright so we're rolling through the
streets here and looks like we're
getting anywhere from 90 to 110 FPS
depending on the textures in the scene
things like that but overall very smooth
experience not getting any sort of
stuttering there is some screen tearing
but that's of course for different
reasons besides the system itself
alright so this gives us a pretty good
idea of how the system performs in GTA 5
and honestly guys with the current
settings that we're using this is
probably the most demanding title that I
use for testing currently so if that's
any indication of how speedy this system
really is
I mean honestly pair this rig with a 4
kg sync display with a decent refresh
rate and you're in friggin business man
so on that note why don't we go ahead
and switch to our next game ok quick
change of plans for whatever reason the
only other game that I have installed on
here Doom is not working it's just a
black screen every time I launch I have
no idea what's wrong and I don't really
have the time to figure it out so
instead of running a second game for
this video I decided to run 3d mark
firestrike ultra a fantastic synthetic
benchmark just to see what kind of crazy
number it spits out and here we have an
overall score of 12,000 854 with a
graphics score of 13,000 873 and just to
put things in perspective I actually
brought up the scores from hotline my
custom water-cooled PC that was pretty
much the best gaming desktop you could
build in 2015 just two years ago and
here these these numbers just look so
sad in comparison an overall score of
8000 271 and a graphic score of 80 366
if we're talking graphic scores the
origin PC has a 66% lead over hotline
which is just absolutely insane so very
impressive numbers all around
additionally I thought you guys might be
interested in the maximum core package
temps for
7700 K so here they are after one run in
fire strike ultra you can see here we
have a max package temperature of 84
degrees Celsius which is pretty warm I
would not be comfortable with it getting
much hotter than that of course the end
user always has the option to dial down
the overclock or remove it all together
if they wanted to lower the temperatures
a bit or even get into their system and
swap out the a IO for a bigger unit
perhaps or even a custom loop should you
be up for the task
alright guys that's pretty much going to
conclude it for this video I'm really
glad I was able to take you along for my
first experience unboxing and setting up
this pre-built system from Origin PC I
thought it was a very positive
experience overall it's always
interesting to sort of acquire a DIY
desktop PC that you haven't built
yourself because it's kind of like you
know you're kind of curious you're
wondering what the person who built it
has done to it you know what does it
look like inside you know did they do
the cable management right by the way
the cable management in this thing is
freaking perfect like it is absolute 10
out of 10 perfection would manage again
but I would make them manage it because
they're much better at it than I am now
at the end of the day yes you could
build this exact system for less money
that's true but I think these pre bolts
are really catered for a specific niche
that may or may not apply to you for
example people who don't have the
technical know-how who just maybe aren't
good with computers but really want to
get in on that
DIY PC gaming experience they've heard
about the glorious pc master race but
they don't necessarily have the
technical skills to build themselves a
rig additionally you might have people
who don't have the time maybe they know
how to build pcs and they feel
comfortable with at least learning about
it but they're just maybe they're a
single parent with two jobs and you know
there are more important things to do
with their time that could be another
reason why they might opt for an Origin
PC PC and finally I'm sure there's a
group of people who just feel much more
comfortable running a PC like this if
they have a direct support line one
company that they have to deal with for
any technical issues that they have with
this one product not 8 to 12 different
products so there's definitely some
value in that I think in piece of mind
if you don't feel comfortable with the
subject matter
or if you don't necessarily have the
time to get your hands dirty I'm going
to get out of your hair now guys so
please lend me some feedback on
pre-built desktops and this video in the
comments below let me know if you'd like
me to take a look at another one of
these maybe there's some some other form
of testing that you'd want to see with
one of these pre-built or maybe you
never want to see me you know feature
one on the channel again let me know
about that too either way toss me a like
