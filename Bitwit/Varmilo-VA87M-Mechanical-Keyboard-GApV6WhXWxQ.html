at mass drop offered to send me this
vermelho VA 87 M mechanical keyboard and
I was like whoa whoa whoa whoa mint chip
key caps ship it but there were a number
of other factors apart from the flashy
key caps that drew me to this board like
the fact that it uses genuine Cherry MX
switches in your choice of black brown
red clear white green click gray and
linear gray I also admired the front
printed legends on each of the key caps
which keeps them from wearing out over
time while offering up a look of
stealthiness you do have the option of
top printed legends along with gray or
white key caps if the color scheme you
see before you makes you want to varmint
the ballpark price of a hundred and
eighteen dollars seems fair for a decent
mechanical keyboard these days although
there's a pretty good chance you can
find it for much cheaper on mass drop
when it becomes available there and I've
put a direct link to the keyboards
product page on mass drop in the video
description below so go ahead and check
that out but assuming you were going to
pay top dollar is the VA 87m a worthy
contender among the ever-growing
competition I suppose that all depends
on what you're looking for perhaps the
thing that surprised me most about this
keyboard right off the bat was the solid
weight and build quality as intriguing
as the pictures were online they really
couldn't do the keyboard justice when it
came to showing off its sturdy
construction it's the same reason you
can't tell how chiseled my ABS are from
merely watching this video everything
from the plastic body to the etched key
caps indicate a high level of
craftsmanship on par with some of the
top tier mechanical keyboards of today
the ten coolest design keeps the board
nice and narrow while the super thin
bezel of the plastic frame makes for a
fairly small footprint which is great
for users with limited desk space yet
despite its portability I can't fully
recommend this keyboard for travel due
to its unforgiving weight AirAsia was
supposed to deliver a shipment of these
keyboards last month
let's hope they make it although it
looks like a chump in size when standing
against my k70 they seemed away about
the same at around four pounds give or
take a few ounces which means you'll
definitely feel the added weight when
tossing this into your back there's
something to say about a heavy keyboard
though this one in particular feels
entirely cemented to my desk when typing
sure most keyboards I come by don't have
a problem with sliding around
but the disproportional size to weight
ratio of this thing gives me a new
feeling of stability from a board
sighs I wasn't expecting and I have to
say it's quite nice fortunately this
characteristic holds true whether the
keyboard lays flat or is elevated for an
ergonomic incline by the two weber
fold-out feet on bottom these serve
alongside five additional rubber pads to
keep the board anchored at all times
also on the bottom facing the rear side
is a mini B USB port to supply power to
this keyboard with an included five foot
rubber cable now I'm typically not a fan
of removable cables with my keyboards
due to the risks of wearing out that USB
connection over time but I was pleased
to see left right and rear cable canals
to minimize potentially detrimental cord
movement taking a closer look at the key
caps each of them is laser etched in
grey using a nice simple font that
really way wait okay what is that is
that Comic Sans so for some reason the
space bar which carries the branding on
this board is the only key cap using a
different font from the rest which
happens to be Comic Sans I'm not sure
which nine-year-old decided that was a
good idea but I do think someone at more
mellow needs a timeout I will concede
this time around on the count of it
being a minor aesthetic quirk
I should also mention here that the
included key cap remover does not work
on space bars you had one job because
this keyboard only sports 108 keys it
does make use of secondary key functions
for things like volume mute up-and-down
multimedia playback right mouse click
and windows lock key oddly enough both
lock keys have a glossy indent on top
that's most likely where the windows
logo sits for top edge key caps very
happy to see when lock on here though
this makes the keyboard all the more
gaming friendly although I do wish there
was some sort of LED indicator to reveal
its on/off state speaking of which this
keyboard does feature white LED
backlighting which can be adjusted to
four varying levels of brightness or
turned off completely with the function
in arrow keys you can also choose to
have this keyboard shipped without LED
backlighting if you prefer less features
I found myself perfectly happy at level
2 brightness when typing in the dark and
felt like Gandalf the Grey was busting
into my room at level 4 okay so it's not
that bright but certainly bright enough
and I think Gandalf would approve unlike
most mechanical keyboards the LEDs rest
beneath the switches as opposed to being
on top and here you can see that the
lower half of each key cap is
semi-transparent in order to allow light
to illuminate those laser-etched
engravings at level 3 and 4 brightness
the contrast between the light and the
underlying key caps becomes much more
apparent
creates a sort of jarring aesthetic I'm
not a huge fan of but like I said level
2 is the highest I need to go in any
scenario so this is personally a
drawback I can look past here we get a
good look at the switch itself and as
you can see I've been sent the sweet
spot offering of Cherry MX browns and
typing on the VA 87m is more or less
what you'd expect from a board with this
type of switch the tactile bump is
subtle yet detectable and low force
properties of the switch mean keystrokes
are registered with minimal effort I did
do a quick sound test against my k70
with cherry MX Reds which are
essentially brown switches minus the
tactile bump so go ahead have a listen
and finally I can't overlook the fresh
minty keycaps themselves they're
comfortable to the touch and incredibly
smooth so smooth to the point that I
noticed my fingers slipping around ever
so slightly when typing of a storm it's
very possible this can be attributed to
the keyboard not being fully broken in
yet with all of my natural skin oils
that provide that extra bit of friction
over time there's a terrible joke in
there somewhere so where does this leave
my overall opinion of the VA 87 m from
ver Miller well for starters it comes in
pretty much every Cherry MX which
available to suit your needs as well as
a variety of key cap and etching options
avid desktop users without the need for
a numpad or macro Keys will also
appreciate the heavy duty weight and
feel finally if you can look past a few
minor aesthetic choices the build
quality and performance fall right in
line with other mechanical keyboards at
this price point and the fact that
you're likely to find a killer deal of
it on mass drop is all the more reason
for my firm recommendation before you
