just won't lie to you oh well I know
what you're talking well hey there then
I switch like five minutes ago I know
that I didn't realize we were all so
straight about three minutes ago okay
cool it's YouTube like 20 seconds well
then in that case why can't I freaking
resize 15 here we go
because it's Windows 10 no let's make
Windows really difficult to chew resize
but you know the handles on the edges
just get rid of them you know I'm
probably gonna make a video about this
there's like three or four really
annoying Windows 10 things for me yeah
one of them is window resizing I don't
know if this happens to you yeah if I
have a Explorer window open what you
half and have many of and then on my
computer when it goes to sleep it max
screen it makes them all if full screens
on full screen yeah but it's not like
it's not like it's it's maximized it's
just made as big as the screen is I have
to go up and grab the corners of each
one to bring him back down to like
reasonable sizes if I want to have him
overload is annoying
I don't know why it does it for some
reason that hasn't happen to me it it's
a 4k monitor and a 2560 by 1600 monitors
so I don't know if that's the two
different resolutions or what but yeah I
can snap it to left and right they're
snapping options and stuff like that all
I'm saying is like I keep windows
relatively smaller compared to right
well says no I believe you I mean
Windows 10 is full chocolate full of
things anyway then they didn't break
things
yeah like Joe's g13 just stopped freeze
he's now the Logitech g13 has a little
claw extra button thing you know gaming
we as a bunch of macros programmer right
right fall creator pro goodness doesn't
work anymore it you know actually a
couple updates ago it broke my parents
entire network like they just couldn't
connect it would drop it would drop the
network every 10-15 minutes and like no
one could figure it out and it was only
after a Windows 10 update I really liked
how on this episode we have immediately
just gonna do my into it as complete one
of our stories that were talking about
but we should probably start the show on
that note so welcome to awesome hardware
everyone this is
so 128 my god we're getting up there so
the point we're starting to lose count
but this is a tech news show in quotes
tech news show that Paul and I like to
have a lot of fun with we have a couple
beers we occasionally use some adult
language so if you have sensitive
hearing with children around then you
don't hold back yes then shoot your
children or lock them in a closet or
something like that until the show's
over and everything will be nice and
dandy this is a super fun show it goes
for about two hours running time we
split the show into two halves the first
half this week is on my youtube channel
youtube.com slash c / bit wit or you can
head over to pulse channel for the
second half which is going to be a link
in my description below or paul's no
youtube.com slash pulse hard way
or if you're on twitter on TV slash
awesome hardware just stay where you are
the entire show gets streamed right here
so welcome nice everyone thanks for
being on out so mod is awesome I love
him by the way I got a chicken dinner
today no my first chicken dinner and I
saw a picture that so those yeah you
were just I was just sticking around
just streaming for the hell of it but
you're just like I'm just wanted stream
symbol guns well I need to post
something today and like I'm leaving for
Virginia for Virginia on Wednesday ah
visit family vagina
so vagina yes someone says Virginia just
save a day yes my aunt lives there it's
gonna be super cool visiting her um but
yes I was like I need to do a video I
might as well stream I had two OSD up
from afterburn stuff so you can kind of
see the Diagnostics from hotlines good
she's getting hot for a custom
water-cooled rig I need to replace the
gonna drain the loop and clean some
stuff out you notice any did you notice
any like ridiculous thermal drops after
you cleaned out arctic panther yeah you
probably didn't watch my video and I had
finally like I didn't get through okay
it's a good apart nervous I I mean I had
some corrosion going on that on in there
I had some some clogged engine some
bills I saw that yeah on the block
itself so yeah yeah I had to do a fair
amount of cleaning except I did not do
good regular maintenance on that that's
why that's why new version of our
Panther has as the proper filling drain
port so I can do it a little bit easier
so you know connect up and flush it and
stuff like that you know I'll clean hot
line eventually when I decide to okay
not not because it's like a regular
scheduled maintenance that I should just
be doing anyway but anyway we've gotten
way off topic here let's see you can buy
stuff from our store yes we have stores
then we sell things on those stores my
store is bit with tech slash store you
can find a link to that in the
description deco friend sell our
moderator cell walls we post them like
that decals
we now have decals aka P Cal's if you
guys want to stick them everywhere don't
stick them in places you shouldn't cuz
that'll look bad on me and Paul don't
take a big stack of them to the Anaheim
Convention Center yeah look do that take
it Matty even at Blizzcon so we've got a
lot of stuff here stuff there good stuff
I want poles over it
he's got bottle openers it's the great
stuff will shout John statue at the end
of the show like should you buy anything
from either of our stores it'll be great
this is everything RGB shirt is one of
my personal favorites right now I think
it tops everything at the moment it is
just - it's just so epic it's so epic
yeah I mean it's so good and just like
the styling the design is so someone
sees you wearing that that they just
understand it immediately
yeah there's no also in the same world
same ly popular my very high quality
bottle openers mm-hmm that you can you
can you can cut you can cut someone with
them yeah there's a great murder weapon
a for self-defense all that kind of
thing all right so let's move on to our
first segment of the day which is ask
the audience this is an interactive
segment that Paul and I started a while
back you guys seem to really like it and
we enjoy doing it so basically how it
works is we're gonna a slate a series
cheers Cheers
we're drinking some Oktoberfest beer oh
yeah I got some other tasty beers on the
way mmm it's November Fest now that's
true there should be a November Fest so
basically we asked you guys a couple
questions you answer honestly with the
straw polls that we give you in chat and
then Paul have to Paul and I have to
guess what your guys's answer is and the
one who is furthest away who gets the
answer more incorrect has to take a
drink all right which is going to become
more painful in just a minute
well yeah we'll explain to you why it
will all become clear dive right into it
with the first question first question
is so this is
an article that we're covering on Paul's
HAP's I'm not gonna steal any of the
show here but there is a new Titan XP
special edition coming out and has been
revealed to be star wars-themed with two
options that you can get two flavors the
Jedi Order which I believe is green
aptly aptly designed to be green and
then we've also got the Galactic Empire
which is has some red lighting so you
got green lighting with the Jedi red
lighting with with the Sith or galactic
empire which one which one would you get
let's say money wasn't an object let's
say it was a giveaway and someone was
giving away Titan XP special edition
Star Wars themed would you go for the
Jedi or would you go for Galactic Empire
this is a serious question
alright there's of course there's always
lots of testing and data that needs to
be this is the crunch despite the Jedi
version it actually looks pretty good
that is the the Empire I have to say
like what they did with the the blower
fan there the little brown for some
reason the PC Gamer pictures we're
looking at our very not low quality my
half will have very high quality they
come with unique packaging and
everything like that yep 1200 bucks each
1200 no don't pay attention that is a
good question now this is the question
of all questions so just so you guys
know we're gonna go out we're gonna go
in and we're going to cover the second
question before we come back and see
some of your responses on this but I
feel like if you watch last week's
episode or saw some of my tweets
recently or something that my my stance
of this might have been given away you
already have the lightsaber I was gonna
get super jelly right now if you pulled
out a Titan XP store yeah if you already
had like you bastard it's like here's
the text we are no longer friends
but I guess we know where Paul stands so
is that is that the answer that you're
gonna go with is that your choice he I
feel like I kind of
hypocrite if you did ever so I guess
accordingly I'll go I'll rap the Jedi
Order for this one but we'll give you
guys clothes I think it's gonna be a
pretty close call because ready mean
look good packaging is pretty cool with
you I wonder does that like led-backlit
that box I don't think so okay it's just
white yes okay that's gonna say that's
pretty fancy schmancy yeah that's good
they risin thread Ripper chance wasn't
more than 1200 for 1300 LED backlit all
right for sure sir alright before we
look at the answers from you guys in
that one let's take a look at our second
question our second question is Intel
and AMD this is yet another article that
policy you got all the good articles
today did Deaver too early Upton early
bird gets the parent Lee that's never
been more true than now so Intel and AMD
I'm sure you lotta you guys already
heard about this are joining forces to
make their their own SOC is this a good
idea or a bad idea this could be a very
polarizing topic as I'm sure will
discuss more on polls half but for now
you guys just decide again links going
out and chat is this is this are we
doomed is this competition at its finest
or is something going to is bound to go
awry with with such just ginormous tech
companies merging in this in this way o
on a product that's crazy
showing you an image from PC gamer right
now by the way guys but yeah that's
pretty crazy news we've discussed prior
on the show some of the rumors about
this because it's been rumored for like
a good year so yeah it's been kind of
bouncing around but like both companies
was it I feel like a month to three
months ago kind of came out it was like
no it's not happening whatever they lied
to us
yep they lied they did bastards can't be
trusted but yeah there's a lot about
their marketing so we'll give that some
thought in consideration yep I'll
reserve all my own opinions for for
later on and let's take a look at Jedi
or Galactic Empire that our Empire
Paul said Galactic Empire I said Jedi
Order the eternal question
guys hey then we have 2-1 vote from the
total results and you guys so I would
like to Empire by a landslide two-thirds
my god yeah yeah you know what I think
it is I think the the standard Titan XP
and all the other founders Edition
geforce cards are already good okay
people are just looking for something a
little bit different Wow a Geforce car
that's actually got red backlit LEDs I
think that's that's probably doing you
some favors there but or to be fair and
square I have except perhaps they have
been seduced by the power of the dark
side what is this rough kid Rumpke n--
yes this is dangerous shit so we need to
do a brief pause here yes we know this
we're not doing it for shemale time
today but this was sent in by a fan
that's right
you can send us beer here this is a
broom driven now it's funny actually
because it was ordered from craft beer
kings and they're in La Habra really
yeah no way get shipped from La Habra
which is pretty damn close to here then
that means he probably should be doubt
like we should just a day or two ago no
this is this was came a while ago oh all
right so this came from Eric in
Connecticut and he just said greetings
from Eric in Connecticut that was pretty
much it so Eric D thank you very very
much
Eric DJing this beer over he said to
some crazy beer and I believe this I
believe this was suggested that past
show this is called rump Caen it's from
Avery brewing which is an outstanding
brewery yeah they do a really good what
is it Maharaja oh yes okay the
Maharajah's oh sorry I didn't realize
you were out as well I had to finish it
off I did drink to the impact they have
a great vanilla bean stout Avery bring
is top-notch they're good stuff so this
is brewed with pumpkin and spices aged
in rum barrels and alcohol percentage by
volume
16.9% Oh which is basically like a like
wine that's about a stronger than wine
but mostly dry and most wines about
Fleming 250 I mean I guess this is about
three times the strength of your average
beer stylist I was lying three this is
like three beers yeah in one beer here
so holy crap this is this is dangerous
my goodness
we're like 1.5 why 16.7% to what Kyle
brought to me hmm I know actually the
best bring I'm like I'm like half bacon
let's see how we are we'll see how we go
maybe we'll just tease it for next
nectar Trumpkin yep alright so i am i oh
sip to the show we're getting the first
answer wrong and you were right you know
our audience better than I do Paul if
that looks cloudy this is cloudy and
body has a has a very looks like it
looks like cider
it does look like cider and I feel like
I'm back at Ren Faire yeah with their
Mead all right well bottoms up Cheers I
have to take a larger sip than you
because I lost it's actually really good
Wow Dan so much smoother than I thought
it was gonna be for 16.9% yeah which is
kind of scary it's like all fall flavors
that's really good Wow geez what Eric
did so complex Harry but everything he
works so yeah yeah okay there's a lot
going on that is dangerous
there's a lot going on and it's
delicious this is so dangerous and this
is like a like a like a Long Island iced
tea I honestly don't think we're gonna
get around to my
well I mean we might tease it where his
case is it for next week yeah yeah all
right let's see how things good all
right moving on to our second let's
let's read the third question all right
the third question is very
straightforward a second this is about
your own personal systems at home so
guys if you have your own rig that
you're watching us from right now go
ahead and take a look at it just look at
it right now wherever it is on the floor
god forbid or on your desk and count how
many fans are in your system right now
so we're including including GPU right
the CPU so like every GPU has two fans
that's two that's two fans correct each
case fan would be a fan yep each fan
peteyboo exactly potentially be a fan
every single fantasy RMV RMR chipset yep
I also also to be taken into
consideration yep
power supply whatever family mm-hmm that
you might not have considered as well
right there's probably a bunch of people
who voted inwards and now we're like oh
shit I forgot we can head up with you
when you take oh yeah this is
consideration all those other ones you
might you might faint first glance just
looking at case fans like oh I like
three or four and then you can't all the
other fans you like I'm like 18 push
push pull pull on my yeah right quad rad
on my chip sites yeah
I forgot I had that configuration like
like TTL did like with the fans like the
hundred like a hundred fingers on each
side of the reach 100 some ridiculously
long threaded screws alright so uh we
never decided our answer for Intel
versus aim be a good idea bad idea okay
I I feel like our audience is mostly
gonna think this is a good idea okay
it's kind of like the The Avengers
right like two superheroes that would
never their universes would have
otherwise never collided and seeing them
together it's just like oh I think I
think it's a good idea I mean wouldn't
it would be nice to see both teams
working together to build the best
possible product for the
Zoomer you would think I don't think
that's what they doing but it's a good
thing to kind of be like wow ideas
quickly that would be cool all right so
since I grabbed the first answer I'm the
first one of course you're saying yes
here so I'll take you guys through this
whole deal like obviously they're just
trying to take advantage of everyone
results sure enough yes full three core
than three quarters listen yes my gutter
together stick it to Nvidia what's wrong
with the video yes nothing's wrong with
my competition though competitions it's
good to put in video in their place I
mean the forgetting to open funny thing
here is I mean if you if you look at
market share for for graphics its Intel
and tells like 70 it's ridiculous about
every graphics yes oh you mean you're
talking about computers but yeah brush
includes integrated graphics oh sure a
lot of theirs
CPUs would've had integrated integrated
graphics for a very long time right
so yeah but the concept of I mean
there's they're mainly talking about
doing this for dynamite laptops I'm not
sure if this is anything that's gonna
you know overlap onto the desktop space
or anything like that
yeah but having much better graphics
which a mdrd Verity no AMD has write in
a laptop with an Intel CPU which they do
a very good job with their low-power
CPUs and everything at that I'd be a
pretty compelling product I think so
especially if you're trying to do more
with your mobile device like triple-a
gaming content creation that sort of
thing
but we'll see what you guys thought fans
fans fans are in your system politics
first on this one I haven't I'm gonna
say lucky number seven here seven fans
is what I'm going for and then based on
the knowledge that our our fans uh-huh
ones out that will hopefully people
watching this this right now uh-huh
they're slightly more on the enthusiast
side but no one's gonna go absolutely
crazy here so I'm talking about probably
three system fans power supply a couple
for a graphics card and one for a CPU
that's that's kind of my thought here
okay and most modern systems don't have
the any like a chipset or vrm fan I
think that summed up so I think I'm
pretty safe for seven okay I am going to
one up quite literally I hope and go
with eight eight Wow I feel like I'm on
The Price is Right yep
I should give you a dirty look I am
doing eight for all the same reasons as
you but since you took seven that's good
I'm taking it
I like your reasons wait we tied look 93
and 97 eight tied tied oh wow I can't
believe that 10 pull-ups I just won I
just won no no no it's what you click
when you die before come on it's that's
just people delayed now they're now
they're like but 10 plus Wow I'm shocked
okay
isn't it weird though that 10 wins and
then it's 6 and then 6 yeah so both of
us were kind of wrong in Chittagong
right 6 I guess over 7 or 8 very nothing
this is very even spread up here though
between interesting 5 6 7 8 9 though no
well 4 9
we need more 9 fan systems out there you
either have feel like you have eight or
you have 10 fans
no one has 9 fans 10 percent is a poor
showing for $4.99 systems I feel like
they don't get enough love I'm gonna do
a special goodness the 9 fan system
bills number 9 really 9,000 views at
least it's gonna be the new RGB 9 fans 9
fan systems are sweeping the nation
oh yeah ok renowned reviewer Paul's
heart rate on video fun a nice 9 fans
system the cultural impact alone yeah
over 9000 ok that's fine let's move on
that my PC is thank you guys very much
for that to hit my PC yes you guys have
submitted a bunch of your rig pics
which sounds strangely and scarily like
dick pics but not the same thing we
shall judge them we will judge them
based on their juice
are they pretty when they look basically
irony and to these dried amines if
that's your real name
Steinem you got an R 5 horizon 5 1600 at
3.8 gigahertz 16 gigs of vengeance DVR
for 3066 nice like that yep GTX 970
overclocked 5 hard drives well 1 SSD and
a fan Tex p400s great case alright well
let's see oh it's an enterprise
oh no it's Millenium Falcon that's
Millennium Falcon this is a Millennium
Falcon yes with the plastics band I like
I like the little touch there hopefully
the plaster doesn't melt your PCB even
the ship sort of glows in that lighting
that's cool alright so what I would say
here is the ketchup and mustard is
definitely a big distraction I'd say
that's probably the number one
distraction in most cases these days in
most systems so if you were to get some
I don't know some sleep extensions
honestly just for your ATX and your PCIe
power connectors I think that would look
really clean clean things up really
clean and uh I don't know if your if
you're actually putting that ship there
24/7 but may I advise putting it on the
power supply shroud it seems like a bit
more of a nice platform down here then
yeah it may be not at all the millenium
talkin is known to conflict with
graphics cards in this type of situation
it's true
due to the protrusion of the we don't we
don't want to capping your framerate or
anything so maybe get it off of your
graphics card I'm joking of course but
um let's see apart from that your
graphics card stands out a little bit
just as the only thing with the red
accent other than of course the the
cable the cabling so I don't know you
could potentially do a mod on this by
removing the shroud and doing some
painting or something like that that
could be a little project to make things
line up a little bit better or you could
get ready to read extensions if I happen
to know they go make credit that black
white and red I think that would look
really nice
ABI be a little bit more of an empire
sort
yeah though and you got the money and
fuck them there so that might for irony
that might complete its spray-paint the
Millennium Falcon bread yes
pretend solved that the Empire has taken
the old Millennium Falcon wow that would
be has ever had this never happened has
it ooh
like I mean it's been hijacked being
captured like the Galecki Empire Jack
hijacking but like the the Empire
actually use using and Falcon against
and then it should react the same way
that the characters do its everything JJ
Abrams would do though I bet fuckin
changing I don't know okay
sorry spoilers nice nice build oh yeah
Rhys Rhys Haley Rhys I'm pronouncing
your name right you had a dual Xeon
heaps 2695 v 212 course each oh my
brother 64 gigs of ddr3 ECC Ram two gtx
980 s in sli intel 732 in 40 gig SSD
with samsung a 50 Evo 5 are you
Sound Blaster is the exercise reserved
Liam Lee PC a 7 6 X case that's Liam in
case interesting to meet Langley cases
like this but you can definitely tell
that it is from the fan and stuff but
wow you know it's those not to us and
the end the end the SLI bridges I mean
this is such a powerful system I mean
you know obviously so that this is that
it's it's it's supposed to heard were
from a year year and a half ago but it's
an incredibly powerful system so like
this is the type of thing I'm like who
cares about what it looks like no you
should you've got so much but yet but
yet you can see the same thing that
worked you can suspend my PC so alright
so we gotta give I gotta give some
advice here alright take these Noctua
fans see if you can get those not to it
covers and it covers that they didn't
sand and put those on there get knocked
to a fans that are black and put blue
corners on the make your system black
and blue because you have blue accent
measures mothered motherboard yeah you
can't really change that at all make
them less
your memory is ECC memory kit
do they make like a dirty memory pretty
ECC memory do they make good looking
east no no don't want you don't want to
not use this memory he's got the
right memory for his computer you can
add on yeah like spreader yeah heat
spreaders aftermarket heat spike buy
some crappy memory that has heat
spreaders and heat get off the heat
spreaders and put it on there like some
of the old Corsair Vengeance no yeah
that might conflict with the coolers
though so never mind
take maybe take off your intel logos on
your Ethernet or Ethernet ports there
yeah you know that's a lie bridges does
that just change the ax on your ax 1500
idle blue yeah so match everything else
and then get rid of your there's a
little fan splitter here that's but it's
only being only one side is plugged
inning anyway that doesn't look good
either
finally all the cables six leaving job
with your cables and where I thought
there were more drives in here but
there's only one drive at the top drive
at the top that's going on over here
hero is something I saw the lightbox
just quick anyway yeah those are our
suggestions yeah yeah what a say yep
beyond that goodbye but again crazy
powerful systems so and apparently from
chats they're saying that his name is
pronounced Reese Reese reason probably
make alright more sense cool thanks
Beast next weekís Cody Cody with
horizon 7 1700 don't build a WoW Ford
drives in this build can you find all
it's like a noob or it's like a newborn
build it is it's an OS looks like a
fractal design an OS where the dorable
system he's probably got maybe one an
nvme and then I think maybe the rest of
them are behind
they must be behind the motherboard tray
cuz you get I think on the nano mess you
have two SSD mounts yeah plus whatever
nvme he's got there and maybe he's
wedged another one maybe there's
actually ok so there's probably room I
believe this I believe right here is the
mount that you have for a 3.5 inch drive
so that's probably one right there yep I
think right in the mother
there's an nvme you like an MDOT to slot
on the back of this motherboard and then
to SSDs on them behind the motherboard
type of motherboard tray yeah that's
probably where you got that's what I'm
thinking but that's still pretty cool
yeah four drives in this system is great
you've got hella fans you got some -
tech tips addition not too as I see
which is totally fine but I wouldn't the
industrial oh oh you're right bright
orange or summer thank you
at any rate either way I still would
have liked to see all the fans be
uniform I think you should just ya go
all the way make them all knock -
industrial fans yeah if you can get a
couple more of those and you can also
get the little kit to swap the tips out
that'll get they'll get rid of your
brown because the madam doesn't really
match with everything right or with
anything and you're right if you were
all brown and black that'd be fine with
me but you're stuck with the red on the
motherboard yeah so either get the red
corners for an all Noctua fans or go all
black or something like that and just
make it very minimal red accent get rid
of your C sonic power supplies sticker
maybe one little short extension here
for your 24 pin yeah just just for that
little part right there yep maybe you
know you can easily go red and black to
match your asrock what card is that
chipset right there oh wait that's a
little shorty card I don't know it is
oh it's rx 560 all right same SI r RX
560 that's 32 gig memory kit damn what
what oh yeah wrap so that yeah that's
powerful system that's a got eight
quarter there's like a portable and or
sixteen thread and 32 32 gigs of memory
so yeah this is a this rig definitely
seems a little bit more geared towards
power for processing and compute tasks
than it does for gaming but of course
you can game same time yeah it says
workstation ability says oh it's
workstation so there we go
yes very nice though Kui yeah well then
well done alright let's go on to Brian
Brian underscore nine nine underscore
nine nine
and so here are his specs I 360 300h 170
Emperor for motherboard 8 gigs of DDR
421 33 and 970 graphics card of course
are carbide 270 are 850 Evo 250 gig SSD
and a 520 watt modular power supply all
right interesting
so obviously cardinal sin here for pip
my PC we have a stock heatsink with
Intel these are horrible yep they're
noisy loud they're they're they're
passable means of cooling your CPU if
you're just getting started or you're
doing it outside of the box build or
something like that but one of your
primary goals when a system is built
with one of these coolers on it should
be to remove it and replace it with
something better because there's lots of
options and lots of them look quite good
for you know around 30 bucks right you
got your you gotta cry rig your h7 you
can drop on there now granted granted
this is not an overclockable cpu so I
will take that into consideration here
your main goal here is just to make
things a little bit quieter give
yourself a little bit better long-term
noise generation and also to get rid of
just make things look better yeah yeah I
cry every gauge 7 maybe even like the c7
or something like a low-profile one that
I wouldn't yeah they look fine on there
those a little bit check totally you
know like a cooler master the master 12
Evo the master air pro 4 would be
reasonably maybe more updated other ones
are the ones I don't know I know max is
trying a blank yeah they're TR 14 oh
it's nuts onto your for you there are
tears ETS for the smaller one yeah
that'd be a good option - those are good
- oh look yeah and that's really the
main thing standing on here everything
else looks fairly clean you have a clear
fan down here which might light up with
a hideous LED when you turn it on yeah
I'm not a big fan of the clear fans the
fans they equates me like the clear
heels they're just little tiny well
tacky and you wonder what they've been
doing to make their money I'm gonna
start calling those stripper fans yeah
they're tripper fans get your dirty
stripper fan out of here
fucking Brian thanks for submitting that
though buddy appreciate it a dark throat
yeah definitely a dark art pro would be
a good movie had to be sexy pair up with
the i3 was 6300 thanks we've got pup
Shepherd the good old pub all right all
right he's got hub pups what what you
toxic counties are flagged no no is it
really this medium sensitive but you
know it's fine okay
Oh learn more no there's more fine it's
a PC perfect wait how come I didn't get
that because when I went to his friends
with top Shepherd I don't know anyway
and I'm not following him
I can't wait did he think oh my oh yes
this definitely is sensitive yeah okay
all right he has a big warning at the
top that it's not safe you're right
that's very right that's a very classy
pup thank you for doing yep good call
pup has some unique tastes that's solely
fine now I can Travis we're trying to
look at this girls
now curious is editing now all of his
media posts I think a gaming machine
maybe I'll like it tell me I'll be in
2016 we don't know all right so FX 8350
to securitize x-series 240 or that 16
gig before my Porsche get
you've been warned he warned them he's
got a 10 gigabit he said got a 10 gig
Wow that's it right so there's there's
our side view yar
there is our oh goodness alright so card
yep this is another variant looks like a
lot of works being done with this
computer yeah I'm like the kind of old
school you've taken all of your case
badges and put put them on the case I
feel like that's not really done anymore
right I used to do that like I'm the
case said the opening flap on the on the
fronts put them on
instead of that sometimes anybody though
the cable management's is mediocre at
best
yeah Kevin just I'm just I think you
have a lot of case upgrade would be I
like the close-up the close-up of the
business end of the hard drives there
yeah just getting getting dirty it would
also help your cable management if you
flipped the drives if possible if you
flipped him 180 then obviously be
plugging in all those SATA cables at the
back cuz he's already got so much going
on back there I mean at this point you
use a floppy drive you have fully maxed
out this appears to be a floppy is this
can't be a floppy drive maybe it's a
nasty dirty yeah it's gonna be a great
leader or something like that or maybe a
two-and-a-half-inch hot swap or
something oh yeah yeah I guess that's
possible too so so something like that
though yeah but yeah you got the optical
drive here more are these more than hard
drives up here look there's more drives
up in the upper parts let's just say I
see an SSD maybe an SSD going up there
but yeah yeah I mean a bigger case I
don't know where to start you need it as
Laura's telling you what to do
aesthetically because it's kind of like
it's kind of like when I've been I've
been doing all this cleanup recently
like the vlog or the video had posted a
few days ago mm-hmm and it's like when I
go and I look at this massive mess and
I'm just like hey where do you stand
again just a lot I freeze up because I'm
like what yeah where do you start
right I don't know where to tell you
where to start here alright the things
that are good you got a good graphics
card you got a good CPU cooler I like
your motherboard you got these add-on
cards which you must be using for
something I don't know what these are
capture cards sound cards that really
memory what's going on there but yeah
like your I really like this picture
because it's someone who is really
there's going to miss there's clearly
something being done with this here oh
yeah you'd be quiet you be quiet
hi Dan go lay down today this broadcast
is brought to you by be quiet anyway
though look up thank you for sending
that in yeah we have one more to cover
here
see do we baby and this is an honorable
mention all right a system that stood
out to me among the rest
my guess Maryanne thank you very much
for your risin five 1600 system with a
gtx 1080 hall-of-fame edition from
galaxy this is truly a pretty system you
got the Wow it's sort of a white grey
and teal theme going on here that
definitely reminds me a lot of Tron
right off the bat which I love the color
scheme there it just looks super clean
yeah what is this an s3 40 elite yes a
perfect case for a build like this
everything just looks so clean the the
extensions or the actual cable saving is
on point all the training looks
fantastic
you've got matching fans all around with
some beautiful illuminated RAM sticks
and a gorgeous cryocooler to match
everything and that MSI logo on that SSD
is fantastic as well everything about
this system it's like the best looking
system you could pull off without custom
water cooling it's like my only - really
nice my only critique here is just one
of those fundamental PC building stuff
of like the ever-rising 5 1600 be 350
board that's fine DT X 1080 I mean I'd
like my only critique would be some of
the stuff the money the spent on
aesthetics here could have been could be
towards getting attendees yeah you're
getting it you're getting a 1700 or
something like that but I mean given the
end results here like it that's again a
very very minor thing I would like you
got a beautiful system here so yeah very
very well done yeah just just a yeah
choice of parts and color scheme and
everything I'm them popping a slight
chub right now yep thank you very much
for that Mary Ann and that's gonna
conclude it for pimp my PC for today
thank you all who submitted you'll have
another opportunity in the future if we
didn't get picked today let's move on to
our next segment which is face-off yeah
keep it rolling let's keep the energy
flowing yeah I promise you guys that
this is a tech news show and we will get
to tech news before the end of my hacks
about tech
we have sure we're using computers to do
the show here's our technology
I love how smart you are
so today's game is the knife party knife
party which just sounds like a gasps you
should grab the keyboard over there
sure yeah but still me that's the only
one but just making sure that it wasn't
like missing missing a guy over there a
guy like a keyboard like if there was
another keyboard over there that I
should have seen but I didn't usually
there's a snackie keyboards day that's
when I was tripping out of girls like
I've been doing a bunch of you be
cleaning moving things around and all of
your cleaning and organizing Paul's
really thrown me off I'm sorry I I can't
find anything I'll try to keep things
get things cluttered against a lot
easier locating things in your garage
when it very soon before you organized
ah it's plugged in guys thank you for
the donations rolling in will be reading
off all the comments you attach to those
at the end of each half of the show so
just keep giving us money all right so
what's do we have a punishment here um I
didn't have one in mind line up lined up
I had a couple ideas for perhaps a
embarrassing tweet that one of us would
have to send to somebody else or perhaps
we have to do like a karaoke cover of a
particularly embarrassing song I haven't
no karaoke set up YouTube YouTube but
you know people just upload like karaoke
don't stop believing by journey and like
you can just do karaoke on YouTube
alright you want to get your video you
know flagged hey hey do you monetize we
don't get them done because my rendition
of we don't get enough views on awesome
hardware and change melody we don't get
immediately Flags always oh gee I'm
obviously the original someone's
uploaded a very high-quality clearly the
sources we found the store we've located
the source gentleman
it's so if you're singing so on point
that it Flags the the journey VEVO
channel for copyright not be writing
your original that's probably what's
gonna happen all right
it's nice party we're gonna knife each
other
stab each other with no that's the plan
we without video games this would just
sound like a night I like this game cuz
there's no other options here but play
play more games and it decapitated head
can you see okay
two player Versalles oh yeah you should
probably look at that player to move the
arrow keys okay oh oh there's a match
you can use magic that's good
there's a ten keyless keyboard here so
our hands are very close together yes my
fingers are nimble and ready for
fingering is that is that right I think
I'll be alright alright no we've ordered
to play versus this looks fine I'm gonna
be fir do you produce produce all these
those are the only two options I am so I
did this earlier and for some reason you
have to press I think I have more armor
and more magic damage
I keep depressed hey Chris let your guy
have to select so f did not work F work
for me but it didn't work for you okay
so here we have to wait this side though
we've to decide before we start playing
now how many we're gonna go up to the
rounds are fairly short so I'm gonna say
what first two three okay is that cool
sure all right let's do it oh jeez
haha Oh No huh I use my magic against
you I'm terrible they said these are
quick they are let should've hit you
you're being a bitch I'm really not good
that's one point for me this is Stannis
we get you the best game ever
it just kept tomates you bitch how come
how come you get like a bottle look at
empty because I I have better magic my
man you like a homeless guy or something
what are you any Matt yeah that doesn't
mean you a better magic no that's my
uplift maybe within the stats oh my god
we're not looking at the stats when we
chose I carried this fairly important
alright I'm drinking beer okay
no I waited for you to look at the
screen alright ready chief
oh Jesus go away
that was an interesting thing I was able
to do that I wasn't aware before you
slide yeah I kind of do the slide thing
slighty slide EIT how we discovering
moves that aren't even listed in the
story like in and out there's a secret
menu they're getting good man you're
getting real good to learn the game
you're so cool
that should appear so smooth right now
good all right one more I figured out
the trick one more here we go
oh all right so that was it only goes up
to best out of three but we're playing
good we're playing to three
so okay so I need one come on Oh
all right all right you win game you win
I'm terrible with and I am clearly
champion of knife fight you're the
champion knife writer I should I should
get into knife fights more right all the
time
well if there's ever a knife fight that
breaks breaks down I'll be sure to have
you on my team
all right you owe me $20 20 different
sets of punishment to see you give me
cash cash okay you have a couple options
here you can either force me to send out
an embarrassing tweet to anyone of your
choice or you can have me do a karaoke
cover of any song or you can force me to
perhaps drink my beer for the rest of
the show out of out of a bowl using only
a spoon and maybe a fork
I like the karaoke option okay you got
it
but I'm kind of now so I like I realized
the audience they need something here so
okay okay can you give me like three
choices of songs that you would actually
know how to sing okay and I'll pick from
those three choices of songs guys and
chats you can let us know if you have
any suggestions as well I'm asking you
because as you know some songs okay you
need to know the song well yeah sure
okay if I was like oh you know writing
wrecking ball see think of an obscure
song alright um let's see sing sing
diamonds on the soles of your shoes by
Paul Simon yeah I don't even know I
don't even know what the hell what the
hell that even is immigrant song that'd
be a good one when do you whole Hotel
California oh yeah that's easy enough
all right man I wish I made guitar
actually can you play on the ukulele no
it's really not in tune I don't think my
guitar is I think so that will probably
get this your your half flags just if
there's anything that's gonna be here
it's gonna probably be hotel okay well I
feel like anything's gonna get a flag
anything that's worth singing here or
what about oh no I don't know that's
good enough
wraps me so like it's so long whiny bow
you have to just sing the you know from
from the after he shoots the guy yeah
right okay
you've got some good ideas here and
pineapple apple 10/10 oh god annoying
yeah it's dumb
I hate it um free bird I need a virgin
free bird yeah wonderful
I'm a abide by CCR you'll see the police
NWA like a virgin
that'd be fun rick roll oh rick astley
just do the classic and they're gonna
give you up yeah all right let's do that
see it's that I feel like that can't get
flagged anymore
I feel like you probably just added that
to its white less than like there's just
too many people we can't we can't
control it just let let the rick rick
gastly go just let it go alright let's
see how this goes I don't I only know
the course really well I don't know like
the verses so I'll do my best but it
could be super cringe it will be super
cringe just so you know so that's a
loading bar letting me know when I'm
supposed to sing yeah okay this is oh I
have no idea what I'm about to say okey
so I'm guessing sorry is that oh god I
don't even know the melody for the verse
I don't even know help me yeah okay okay
all right here we go let you never gonna
run around and desert you never gonna
make you cry never gonna say goodbye
never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
we've known each other for so No yeah
your husband makings of you to just say
I don't know this part let's say we both
know us go around we know the game
never gonna give you up never gonna let
you down never gonna run around and is
hurt you desert you bet you never gonna
say goodbye never gonna tell a lie and
hurt you will give you up never gonna
let you down never gonna run around and
desert you never gonna make you cry
never gonna say goodbye never gonna tell
a lie and hurt you
yeah well there's more back that way
there's more but again for the sake of
all the people who have shares we will
sound immediately thank you thank you
and good night
no actually we still have more to talk
about yes we do but hey that was fun
okay with everyone who endured that
moment of our dream tonight we have some
tech news for you all thank you for
clipping the chat appreciate it thanks
for sharing that moment with the world
everyone needs to see it all right we're
peaking I'm sorry I can turn up the
compressor yes you'd be competing we
thank you I'm flattered we are peaking
this is the best we've ever done okay
okay we can really I'm not usually gonna
take them compliments it's my best you
know it just keeps getting better as
you're talking right now but people keep
coming back to awesome hardware Hey all
right guys let's talk about some tech
news let's bring it down a notch here
get back to reality about this serious
yeah I'm serious serious things are
happening in the tech industry you
should all be war is gonna affect
everyone in video first starters is
reportedly restricting its partners all
of its beloved add-in board partners
from selling GeForce GPUs gaming related
graphics cards for server and
high-performance PC use or HPC use this
is an article from game debate they
actually have been noticing or actually
caught wind from digit times digit times
was saying that gaming GPUs first
starters as we all know are not just
good for gaming and a lot of server
suppliers are using GeForce car
for their server and HPC usage instead
of the more expensive Tesla and Quadro
cards which is what those cards are
really intended for to handle those high
high-end workloads but you know gaming
cards are good for that sort of thing
too and even more so gaming GPUs are
typically cheaper than
professional-grade workstation cards so
a lot of these ad and board partners are
saying hey we can cut down margins
significantly if we just put some gaming
GPUs inside of our server and HPC based
systems instead of forking out six grand
for a freaking Quadros enterprise stuff
in general is extremely exactly yes so
they're really able to cut down margins
this way and also sell their product to
customers for a cheaper rate but NVIDIA
has been catching wind of this lately
and they're not too happy about it so
they've actually been putting in
stricter measures with the potential
threat of withholding GPU distribution
from these companies from their own ad
and board partners if they don't adhere
to their rules and at this point
businesses have two choices they can
either concede and be like okay fine and
video if you're gonna put us in this
corner we're going to just we're gonna
we're gonna bite the bullet and buy a
Tesla or Quadro product or they could
completely lash out and go the opposite
way and maybe seek out competitor
offerings from the likes of AMD with
their fire Pro Series cards or what's
the other one
instinct or even Radeon hardware they
might just start going for Radeon GPUs
and then what a clusterfuck would we be
in when Bitcoin liners and server age or
slash HPC suppliers are eating up all of
the gaming GPU inventory we could see
prices rise even further just when
they're just barely starting to come
down as we'll talk about more in Pauls
half but it's quite interesting it's
it's sort of it's sort of it kind of
makes a case for gaming GPUs really like
even if you're not gaming who Roger
could see
is this just in oh this is two hours ago
holy crap okay so this is an article
that we will potentially talk about
either okay okay we already share stuff
first okay so let's do it after you're
playing stuff okay so this is all it
important now so let's do this quickly
yeah holy you're a big girl Stephen
Britt big growth in in 2018 so this is
from E times the DRM exchange which is a
Taiwan based firm that tracks memory
chip pricing has claimed that Samsung
whoo olds who holds 45% of the DRAM
market is increasing capacity to get a
leg up over the competition and also to
keep newer Chinese companies who are
trying to get into that market out there
trying to keep the Chinese people out
and Chinese people it sounds racist the
Chinese companies out of the DRAM market
the trying to snag calls versus chair
business this business that point Paul
the firm is projecting DRM bit supply to
grow by twenty two point five percent
next year that's up from nineteen point
six percent in 2017 Samsung is allegedly
planning to allocate some of its
capacity that had been initially set
aside for NAND flash 2d tranche so
they're going okay let's pull some
inventory from NAND flash and let's put
it towards DRAM and this is gonna scale
up the amount that's just the shear
capacity or amount of DRAM that Samsung
is a tech giant will be supplying next
year and this is of course going to sort
of force Samsung's competitors which is
currently SK Hynix
and what's the other one SK Hynix and
what is it
no micron micron could not remember the
microphone why I'm at P micron
technology to also sort of increase
their output to stay competitive in the
market and this week
Samsung has announced its highest-ever
quarterly semiconductor sales so that
was it was also gonna focus on cost
competitive DRAM solutions which should
theoretically mean that in 2018 we
should be seeing lower D Ram prices
memory will finally be more affordable
than it has been in the past and this is
like they have been
the market and it's happened before it's
probably gonna happen again but you know
there's been accusations of the
manufacturers of DRAM kind of putting a
squeeze on the market over the past six
months or so which just led to the
rising prices most D Ram kits that you
look at now if you look at the nine
months or a year ago they've doubled in
price but then what happens is the price
raises and then eventually you have a
company like Samsung is like all right
price is high we're gonna manufacture a
bunch now mm-hmm and and take advantage
of those high prices right then the
other companies have to do the same
thing yeah
because as long as there's at least a
few of them as long as that's just one
you know manufacturer of DRAM right then
more of them will start upping their
output and hopefully we'll see prices
come back down yeah and I think it's
kind of a lightning rod as soon as the
the DRAM prices skyrocket a lot of all a
lot of these other Chinese companies
that are sort of no-name in the u.s.
anyway are starting to see dollar signs
and they're like okay well we can make
ridiculous margins off of the DRAM we
sell in the US because the the market
pricing is so high right now and I think
this has sort of been Samsung's response
to that and going holy crap now that
DRAM is going for so so high selling for
so high right now I mean it helps us but
at the same time it's also sort of
catapult in all these new Chinese
companies into our market and we'd like
to weed them out and be like on top
again and and retain our market share so
let's just continue making a shit ton
more DRAM so we can sell it at lower
prices and stay more competitive amongst
the competition so that's kind of what's
going on here and I will leave it at
that for that article but long and short
TL DR is cheaper memory 2018 coming soon
next up we've got an article from video
cards calm this is about an X FX custom
Radeon rx Vega GPU we're suspecting that
it's a Vegas 56 based on the PCIe power
connectors we've got one six and one
eight pen which follows the reference
design of Vega 56 this is from XFX of
course it's got two large red fans with
a carbon fiber style shroud
genuine carbon-fibre I'm sure but
interestingly it's go again PC I cannot
you know but not only is that a notch
there's that's where the PCA connectors
are the power plugs are right smack in
the middle of the PCB or at least the
middle of the card I I believe that the
PCB is actually quite short route itself
is longer they're down here yeah the PC
is there no better picture of that in
this article video cards I don't know
yeah you would think with a website like
video cards comm that they would have a
little bit more visual elements for us
but oh okay yeah I mean I imagine if you
have a a nice sleeved kit or something
maybe it look kind of cool tucked into a
little notch you know maybe yeah I don't
know yeah I'd like to see more pictures
of it there's like six in an 8-pin I
feel like the closer you get the closer
you move the power connectors to PCIe
slot the longer distance the cables have
to travel from whatever grommet or you
know cut out there yeah refer them down
on the end of the card yeah and them in
the middle it can be more awkward for
cable management right so it would be
interesting to actually see like if you
took this card and put it in a variety
of different cases even the case is that
like the the s340
or the s340 elite that has the actual
cable cut out for GPUs at the bottom on
the power supply shroud if that would
actually line up fairly well or it would
still be a disaster what you need with
this card is it is like a Jeep like a
water a water block that goes on it
right that has the in and outs like on
either side of where the the cables come
out and so you can have like the the
tubing come out and the cables it's the
same I'd be cool I don't know maybe I'm
pretty look definitely look Union that
could be fun yeah so you guys can look
out for that it's got a full cover back
plate LED backlit logo that sort of
thing no pricing and availability as of
yet next up we've got an article from
ARS technica this is about the Android
security update for November that
rolled out clang this is a fixing crack
the crack situation that Paul talked
about I believe you talked about this on
a recent episode we did
perhaps this week also slapping a
bandaid on the pixel to excel screen
which we've talked extensively about in
episodes prior so there was actually
three patches that Google released for
Android this month and they've been
released with the fix for the high
profile key reinstallation attack which
is known as crack
for those who missed it crack is pretty
much a vulnerability there was a
vulnerability that was found in the wpa2
protocol which is basically responsible
for Wi-Fi network security and it was
discovered that a key reinstallation
attack or crack could compromise the
encryption between a device and its
access point allowing him attacker to
basically view or access data that was
assumed to be encrypted which is
obviously bad news for anyone who uses
Wi-Fi google has patched a ton of these
crack related bugs under the 2017 - 11-0
six label so that's what you want to
look for in your about page on your
mobile device if you want to see if if
you've received that patch yet the patch
treats android 8.0 oreo all the way back
to 5.0.2 lollipop and additionally if
you have a pixel or Nexus device I
believe the patch is still waiting to be
rolled out for those devices so pixel
and Nexus you have to wait on that for
but I'm sure it's just like literally
probably coming out later this week or
maybe next week the patch is also
bringing some quasi fixes like semi
fixes to the pixel to XL to XL screen
that Google announced two weeks ago this
was a serious issue that the phone was
having with burnin and to address this
concern Google is planning to release a
patch that maximizes the screen
brightness to a virtually imperceptible
50 CD / M tune it's so it's gonna
actually lower the the Mac
brightness by a smidge that to the human
eye isn't really you're not gonna notice
the difference allegedly but it should
reduce the amount of load that's
happening on your device on the screen
specifically additionally the always-on
navigation bar which was the biggest
culprit for burnin on these devices is
going to dim when it isn't being used so
it's kind of adaptive in that sense and
it's also gonna switch from black to
white depending on the application that
you that you're running as for the dole
color that's been continually reported
with the pixel to XL Google has added a
new color section did you get your pixel
too already
yeah I'm returning it for a refund are
you really yeah
have you is that because you actually
checked out the phone and looked at the
screen and we're like you noticed that
it was that poor quality or it's because
my camera on the phone stopped working
really yeah
not an issue I have heard about reported
very widely or anything but I initially
opened it up and started using it on
Saturday morning I had set up to do like
a vlog with it I recorded the unboxing
of it and I took it out and I was
started like we went on a walk with our
with our dogs on Saturday morning and I
was recording stuff with it and
everything like that and then after
about two or three hours of using it
suddenly whenever I tried to access the
camera on it it would freeze up and like
whatever app I was trying to use to
access the camera whether it was the
camera app or you know messenger or
hangouts or whatever it would just
freeze up and lock out and wouldn't let
me use the camera Wow
yeah it was kind of a crappy a crappy
thing to happen yes a big reason why I
got the phone was because of the camera
and
to get that phone like my thought when I
get it is one I have the original pixel
excel and I really really like it it's
my favorite phone yeah so did a really
good job on that
yeah excel to their to excels supposed
to have a better camera yeah
so part of my thought and getting that
is like alright my phone that I always
have on me and I make videos for a
living any of social media accounts yeah
Graham its anytime I want to pull like
that I don't want to be able to take a
picture with it you know that I ordered
it before any of the information to come
out about the blues greens blue shift on
the led about the burnin on the o LED I
was willing to sort of deal with that
yeah
as it happens yeah but then I like
actually had a physical technical
technical problem with the phone yeah
that's that wasn't it like I did I did a
full factory reset on it did not fix it
Wow basically the connection between the
camera and the there's a hardware issue
going on somewhere in there as far as I
can tell
so yeah here's to see what Google's
quality assurance or quality control
section looks like well is this how does
this actually slip through the hell was
it LG was an LG LG OLED this yeah yeah
and it's one of the first LG OLED to be
featured on a flagship phone in quite
some time
yeah so I mean which is why they rolled
this out this the new color section in
this in the display settings with a
saturated mode that basically makes the
display look like a Samsung the lid is
what the article says it's like let's
just basically make it look like a one
of those because that's what most of the
flagship phones today are using as a
Samsung OLED there's also a natural and
a boosted profile that you could choose
but the saturated is what actually will
ignore the original srgb settings and
apply its own distinct filter to make it
look more like a Samsung phone which
seems to be what people like on their
phones these days so I'm I'm very
shocked
I'm very sad and
disappointed that the camera wasn't
working for you yeah it was it was
enough of a thing where like because I
could I could have asked for a
replacement I could have gotten a
replacement mm-hmm like that was an
option and they replace it and
everything but sure like I was already
not any of the first people to post a
video on the pixel 2xl yeah you know
that's fine I was willing to do a video
a little bit after the fact sure it'd be
even further delayed by the RMA process
for everything and just the fact that
it's like literally it's like $1,000 the
the configuration I got 128 gigs of
storage and everything yeah was close to
$1,000 yeah and you don't expect I'm not
sure I'm not willing to put up with the
issues that if I'm not with it on top of
the the hardware issue that I had it
along with that so I'm just like no I'll
get a refund yeah look at another phone
I am NOT for people in chances and I've
said yes seminole said you know we said
you I wanted to do look I'm looking
forward to the person - I'm still
totally finding my pixel XL yeah it's a
very good thought if anyone said it's my
wife because my wife was expecting my
pixel XL to be handed down to her well I
had to pixel to XL bummer we'll see how
that goes though she maybe we can find
another optional replacement for it
but all right what's next all right
let's move on to our last article for
tonight which is our list for my half of
the show which is about intel and AMD x'
custom SOC you know what I'm gonna save
this I'm gonna put in my two cents on
this on your half because we're short on
time so let's go ahead and wait let's do
your your add-on story here though okay
my add-on story and then this is
breaking news days later breaking news
so earlier today the information came
out that Rodger Kaduri the kind of heart
and soul of our gradient technologies
group is leaving he's departing them
he's been us on a sabbatical for a while
oh I mean who cares Paul he went on
sabbatical a big tech companies all the
time what's I know about this one so the
big the big drama now and
is a WCC F tech article so as always
grain of salt salt a little more like a
like more than a grain Paul but let's
stir the pot a little bit does Roger
Cordrey according to WCC F Tech is
seeking new horizons that Intel oh oh my
god ah given know given the crazy news
about the Intel and AMD making a
combined chip together as well as maybe
NASA too far off base but you Benedict
oh my goodness it like other events now
Intel press events it would be weird
seeing him and he just took a sabbatical
from AMD
did he not after the Vega launch yeah I
just said that I'm a little hazy honest
Trumpkin alright the rump khun's got me
hammered yeah this is this is really big
news and the fact that he was so heavily
invested in the graphical side of things
that AMD leads you to believe that he's
also gonna be apparently the presser
because you've outmatched the compressor
with your Kyle vs. compressor we're
still a compressor level I want to say
for round one right now poit okay this
is this is insane I did not see this
coming
I didn't see this coming even more than
I saw Intel and AMD collaborating on an
SOC I mean I have to think that he's
he's gonna help them now with the SOC
and did you imagine if Intel released a
discrete graphics card
should I continue yelling and have my
lungs so that you can test the
compressor probably not now that
attorney on Sep oh oh geez
oh wait what what effects what effects
we probably sound like like penis I mean
if we if we do our demon impersonations
voices we sound like 10 times like
demons that's my only disappointment
about streaming it okay sorry headphone
users since everyone's going crazy
alright alright
end of the show when there's some shout
outs for people who have given us
donations right oh really really quickly
try to answer some questions that have
come through yes
Tom's brems myths from the 15 origin
Rona Kyle I you can then it would be
great to read my donations in skin deep
skin to the Amin accent by the way with
your first impressions about floatplane
community versus YouTube Effie first off
I don't know what whose can take me an
exit sounds like level on how to
actually impersonate one candidate but
do you know no I I just I can't do it
justice so I'm not gonna try but I'm
flattered that you would ask floatplanes
me how long I watched Pippi Longstocking
when I was giving yeah I don't even
knows that qualifies I haven't seen it
since I was like seven I think yeah
so it's an oldie but floatplanes been
awesome I like it a lot more than
YouTube already okay yeah the video and
audio playback on their platform on
their player is way better I'm sure I've
said this a thousand times but the 720p
on floatplane looks like the 1080p on
YouTube it really is like crispy I have
to watch out and make sure that there's
like so no dust on the components really
shows it's real it's really good awesome
if I can if I can propose the counter
here to the floatplane
you know glowing review or whatever yeah
Luke
Luke one of the driving forces behind
floatplane flavors here's what I foresee
right floatplane people are looking for
some sort of alternative to YouTube sure
for various reasons why wouldn't they
float plane has some potential to become
one of those alternatives there's been
other attempts in the past such as
vessel and that kind of thing
flow plane if it does happen to become
like what if it becomes a competitor to
YouTube 50% even like a quarter of the
use of YouTube's
you know viewership and that kind of
thing what if that actually happens Luke
will become like a rich evil dude that
sounds like evil v8 he'll be rich all
this money and evil and just because the
riches yeah it comes with the evening
off like what does a little like a
little mustache and whatever you really
you'll become evil Luke because of all
the money you'll probably look exactly
like Roger Kaduri because absolute power
corrupts absolutely and obviously if you
have the amount of power that someone
with you know like it like if you were
in charge of YouTube right if you were
like YouTube is mine then I own it and
whatever like you'd have a pretty decent
amount of power you probably end up
being evil probably what happened but
you know what Luke is also Canadian so
like evil Canadian is like our version
of a really good person like even an
evil Canadian would be like maybe just
maybe he just develops a really evil
voice but he's still just as nice as he
always is he's always nice looks always
nice in my experience I've never felt
any ill-will towards towards Luke or
felt that he had any towards me I I feel
like he's a nice genuine person and
that's what makes me truly terrified of
him it certainly does have a silver
tongue
which I would not like those myself
let's really please Fred ranch $5 no
more money for Kyle until he takes wife
to a very nice dinner cuz I took her to
a very nice dinner recently he did yes I
did you can ask her all about it if she
I don't know if she's in chat I haven't
seen her but yes I did take her a nice
dinner I wouldn't be opposed to eat her
turn those other nights did you choose
my wife had we gotten all the time in
the world take my wife to dinner tonight
I know and I will she's making me a nice
dinner
does that count no it doesn't count
because she's doing it anyway also I
think Jenny's wasted Jenny keeps texting
you randomly you know oh good fun
fucking my phone Brian win five dollars
and 11 cents my water cooled 980ti is
dying what should i buy to drive by
1440p 144 Hertz freesync monitor also
can I put vodka in my custom loop I
would say a 1080 or a 1080i yeah 1440p
144 cards even a TIV clutch even a 10-7
TTI I mean if you're really like if like
450 bucks is your cutoff you can't spend
your ever than that then maybe a 10-7
TTI that would be another reasonable
solution via any of those options that
count mentioned Brian Sprouse 10 bucks
love you guys your vids are we're coming
in to Pete building pcs wait what
bright-eyed freesync monitor but he has
a freesync monitor Brian Webb oh oh oh
yes totally Oh Brian Webb yes 36 because
we're discuss on my half of the show you
can actually buy him for like yes maybe
not 400 bucks prices are all over for in
20-ish at least as of earlier today
we'll see when we get back to my half
but Brandon thank you good catch Brent's
right across 10 bucks love you guys your
vids are what got me into building pcs
question for Kyle though which CPU
cooler worked better in your no 202
projects the cryo you see seven or the
Noctua l 9i I know you used both I know
I know we live - um honestly I think the
c7 actually dropped temps
about three to five degrees over the
Noctua l9 I yes yes it did it actually
has a slightly it looks to me like a
bigger fan on it and a slightly bigger
heatsink I mean don't get me wrong the
Noctua l9 I is fantastic if you're
really pressed for high clearance
because it is like almost half height of
the c7 but because of that you're also
losing out on some heat fin your fin
array just surface area and things like
that so I would say the c7 performs a
little bit better but you are losing out
a bit of that clearance nation bear that
in mind
mr. Senor you can't go wrong with either
though mr. Senor
five bucks not a question for those of
you looking for an ultra wide monitor
the alien aww three four one eight DW 8

ladies Kyle Congrats on floatplane thank
you very much Paul join the bandwagon
and then finish the HTPC what's dinner
plans maybe if Linus would give me a
call I knows he did you talk to me about
it but I've entered a fella I think you
were a prime a prime suspect for the
floatplane age everything yeah but yeah
I am not opposed to floatplane so I'm
assuming the option the offer is still
out there from LMG I feel like the
floodgates have now opened yeah me
because they weren't actually planning
to sign on any partners until late
December like it's doing two months away
all right and so now that they've signed
me on they're like okay well maybe you
know I feel like they they're probably
gonna start reaching out to more more
partners yeah don't be surprised if you
see me jump on there too yeah and lmg if
you're watching hit me up couldn't
Clayton for the five bucks wondering if
it's worth upgrading to an 87 hundred K
from a 67 hundred K early next year no
I'm going to school for 3d modeling
animation and currently using a gtx 1070
still no it's the only worthy upgrade
from a 6700 K at this point would
probably be up to thread Ripper or sky
like X I am oh that's reasonable
yeah you're gonna see any mad gains from
anything else for your six core for your
application 3d modeling and animation
which is probably gonna be very compute
intensive compute yes an upgrade from
sixty seven oh two K to eighty seven
hundred K would it require an upgraded
motherboard and base platform in which
case you'd probably better be better
suited looking at something they can
provide you with eight cores are above
sorry to get you up right now
such as an AMD rise an option or beyond
that if you have a little bit more money
thread Ripper or sky leak X here we go
thank you pop Shepard five bucks for now
my PC I use for content creation the ten
gigabytes I think that's the big event
next umm connects to my six terabyte
drive mass I will upgrade to Verizon 718
the next very informative that's awesome
that sounds like a sweet little set that
you've got there man 6 4 terabyte I need
to get something like that I only have
like weight less than that yeah I want
to do that 10 give it between this area
and then back there nice ZZR hardy 10
Australian we are your friends and this
is an intervention please no more
karaoke nice Ronnie you I've been
watching since March my best friend
streams twos Tuesdays but I watch you
all anyway mind rating him tonight his
name is KY lby TV on pitch that's up to
sell we help we do whatever sells tells
us to so look at that person and see if
they're actively streaming and if
they're not you know like killing
children or something and then perhaps
you use your own judgment whether or not
we should scream to that radial X seelix
month too long ago two dollars and
seventy seven cents what our good pair
of over ear headphones that are good for
gaming and listening to music around 150
to 250 bucks I want to say here
Sennheiser's the Sennheiser's are really
good those are the gaming series this is
the older version these are the PC 360s
but the sense says Sennheiser gaming
series yeah which has various options up
in the the exact range you're looking
for I have really been happy with both
with the really comfortable sound
quality as well as it's not like Mike
like we're using right now but the boom
mic that you get with it is also quite
nice nice cool if you guys were looking
for something if you were looking for
something more just like on the headset
or headphone I should say headphones
side of things without a microphone
built in honestly the beyerdynamic dt
880 pros that I bought years ago are now
on
one hundred two hundred fifty bucks
which i think is a huge bargain you do
need a pretty good amplifier yes a
candle well they actually come in like
thirty to sixty or so you can you can
have your pick of the litter there but
just make sure that you're able to
actually drive whichever ohms you go
with additionally we've got heli dragon
five ten ten bucks
thank you very much sir guys my Linux
workstation is an i-5 twenty three
twenty enough grade to i7 3770 or full
horizon three thirteen hundred X gaming
rig as arisin seven seventeen hundred
budget is consideration so new or
upgrade my old crap
hashtag raised all the things I would
say if you are currently at an i-5 23
2008 say I'm gonna say go for the rise
in three thirteen hundred X because if
you're already having a rise in seven
seventeen hundred for your main gaming
system you have an easy upgrade path
there once your gaming system upgrades
to the next whatever it happens in the
next year or two you can immediately
upgrade your 1300 X based system on I
have 40 or 1700 that's true upgrade path
available there yeah that's that's what
I would go for it plus I mean if you're
talking about a Linux workstation system
they're very efficient so that's what
that's what I would say ya 3770 is still
a good chip but it's it's old its old
its old and there's nowhere to go from
that like the chipset doesn't have
nearly as many features poor Maximus
Maximus $5 can we expect to see an
upgraded build to the go anywhere do
anything PC with Rison or coffee like
parts if so will you stick with the no -
OH - I actually did do an upgraded
version of that of the gada system ga da
go anywhere do anything with risin 1800
X I believe or was horizon 7 1700 I
think either way it was arising that 8
quart and it was fantabulous I've since
disassembled its because I needed the
parts for the thing that's very sad but
perhaps I'll do something else with that
in the future
no 202 is a great case I absolutely love
it especially since it can be easily
modified to fit a 120 millimeter AO
Sebastian Casella foot
any arse hey Kyle are you ever going to
add Steve to your old tattoo burrs
impersonations video love this episode
keep it going you know what I've been
considering doing impersonations part
two because I've been getting a lot of
requests for it lately um there's some
people who have gotten more popular
since you did the original the game has
changed yeah
the game and the community has changed
as far as tech tubers go there are a lot
of people like it for sure
trust me guys I've thought about this
more than you have there are a lot of
new to waiters the wig for Steve I think
would be there yeah the tech Jesus Steve
yeah oh the flowing locks it's it's very
is a very enticing proposition that's I
heard you talk about how terrible like
this terrible Intel thing in this
terrible AMD thing in this terrible and
video and it all sucks everything so
awful god forbid and put in a Coulomb
out there there any of them attempts to
launch a product this is shitty you can
see crabs everywhere
alright Giovani immediately commanding
five dollars from last week do you guys
really think two gtx 970 s in sli isn't
enough VRAM you kept saying 3.5 gigs but
isn't it's seven or still get a GTX ten
any before College no not seven very
common misconception you're you when you
go SLI you do not add the memory pools
of both graphics cards together both
graphics cards need to have whatever's
necessary in the video memory assets for
and textures and that kind of thing nice
of it and both so you still have
effectively 3.5 gigs in each card yeah
seven combines toll right so yeah that's
that's our same VRAM is might be short
there with nine 70s in SLI especially if
you're looking at high resolutions in
1080 or 1440 right the vram isn't quite
cooled as simply as you might think it
is
jujubee's for the thirteen dollars and
thirty seven leet buddy sorry been a
while your talk show comes on
right as I get off of work and didn't
transit recommend recommendations for a
10 keyless under a hundred bucks
I like the color master master keys
series under owner bucks nowadays I'm
not sure if it's under hundred bucks
probably depends on the version that you
get but ten keyless yeah this is what
you said specifically right and the ten
keyless are typically less expensive so
right I take a look at that beyond that
I'm sure you might be able to find like
a ducky keyboard that's ten keyless yeah
those are pretty well received amongst
the mechanical community and for me it
comes down more it's like what what
types of switches you like best seasons
and then what various options you can
find that switch implemented on to an
actual keyboard force but yeah I mean
keyboards if there's any benefits that
how many actual keyboard manufacturers
there are its there's lots of options
right Zachary Hummel
ten bucks do y'all want some shiner I
love shiny what's Jenny
Shaner buck Oh shiny Bach yes of course
why not I believe I believe that's what
he's talking about
yeah she's good yeah say what some
shiner can't get it over here in the
states or at least in the gallery he did
another ten dollars and asked that same
question again and there is the same yes
double shiner give us twice the shiner
mr.singh yard five dollars with Google's
quality control issues would you say the
higher SPECT razor phone with a four
hundred gigabyte microSD is a better
option mr. senior I can't say that I
haven't checked because I haven't
physically handled that phone but it has
any gaming it has been getting very good
feedback from what I've understood it's
a very good feedback but also from
reviews that seem to be at the Razr HQ
or at least closely associated with the
brand new
maybe indicating that the videos were
possibly sponsored or potentially paid
for I don't know it seems like a lot of
the Razr phone coverage seems from right
there was some for mark Romo looked like
there was some marketing money behind it
for Marquez uh I mean I'm not calling
out anyone specifically but I don't
think all of the creators that posted a
review on that phone were sponsored but
I definitely feel like cuz Marquez I
follow him on Twitter and I mean Marquez
always does really fair reviews yes
that's why I'm saying him speaking
positively of the razor phone which I
feel like I saw once or twice I'm still
like hold as a reviewer myself though I
still feel like I need to have the phone
in my own hands to give my own two cents
on it like ya where I'm just like buy
this phone or buy this product because
this reviewer said it was good I just I
just know too much about things in order
like like as well because I'm not seeing
any of his no no he definitely did a
razor phone video I saw it I watched it
and it was really good and I he's if I'm
if I'm interested in a phone mkbhd is
the only person I go to really he's like
he's the he's my go-to guy he's probably
not the only guy but he's my like the
first choice so I don't doubt that the
razor phones good at all
in fact I've been wanting to do some
sort of content piece on it but I just
feel like I don't know I don't know I
don't know it's weird it's weird
yes razor for a lot of the content
around it I felt like seemed a little it
seemed like everyone was saying the same
thing a hundred and up on the phone one
hundred and two thousand thumbs ups
normal insane alright that was a really
great video yeah but anyway so yes
feeling you chat I see is
I see is no I would love to get my hands
on that thing man
tweet men it's it's one of those phones
it's like even though I'm not into
mobile gaming that might be the phone
that gets me into mobile gaming
no I'm saying yes and I'm saying I've
also told myself I'm not gonna have more
beer until you finish your happiness
shit all right okay spy guy for 2015
bucks
here's another few bucks cuz you guys
are just awesome and thank you spy yes
boat wanna blaze it Perry Ellis five
bucks looking to upgrade my monitor to
an Asus PG 340 Q or the SRX 34 which one
do you recommend or would I be better
waiting for the new 200 Hertz monitors
I'm not particularly one to hold out for
two hundred Hertz monitors because
whereas I will gladly be like yeah the
human human I can't see more than 60
frames per second that's BS right you
definitely get something 100 Hertz or
144 oh yeah or 160 but the higher you go
up there are Domitian diminishing
marginal returns on that so I don't
think you get a huge benefit out of
waiting for 200 Hertz so I'd say plus
how much graphical horsepower do you
really have to have realistically to
push 200 FPS that's true as well so yeah
the PG 3 for 8 Q might be a good option
for you I've been loving mine honestly
I've been loving the PG 3 for 8 Q's and
I've been enjoying my a 3 X 30 for you
you really can't go wrong go with the
one that looks the best because the end
of the day they're gonna offer you about
the same performance that's what I'm
going to say alright $5 use this money
to make a $5 PC that can run all games
at 4k resolutely thank you so processing
