video and you might be wondering what
what what's the vlog about this time
damage Hardware no no it's not
fortunately this is actually a bit more
joyous of an occasion I'm here in the
beautiful city of Laguna Beach which is
of each and I've been invited here by
the fine folks at WD they've invited me
to their creative community summits
which is basically like this
meet-and-greet type thing with a bunch
of other reviewers like myself Paul from
Paul's hardware is actually here think
he's probably in the room above me but
basically I am just here to talk about
WD stuff and learn more about the
products that WD is putting out this
this upcoming year and it's pretty sweet
they pay for all the travel expenses and
like like any travel vlog I do have to
do an obligatory hotel room tour so
here's the living room
slash bedroom it's all kind of one room
pretty nice here's a bathroom that's
really nice super nice bathroom really
fancy countertops oh yeah it's so smooth
and of course we've got some weight oh
wait turn the air off killing my audio
huh we got a bar get a bar I'm gonna
glass see at the glass lamp an lg tv
pretty sweet bottle of Jameson oh wait
no I brought that let's head to the
balcony I'll show you the balcony it's
actually really nice we're we're only on
the second floor but and I thought I
wasn't gonna have a nice view being so
low to the ground but look actually
that's super blown out hold on pretty
snazzy we're at the surf and sand hotel
by the way I should have I should have
mentioned that earlier which is a super
fancy resort I've never been here
because otherwise I have to pay for it
and I think that's the event right there
we're supposed to have a dinner at 7
o'clock
it's like 7:05 I should probably go down
there and start mingling the people in
so instead of making damn vlogs Hey look
hey look it's pulling his wife say hey
guys yeah
I don't care No so we've been here all
day this is the morning after the last
clip that you saw all day it has been
all day
10:51 and it's still morning so all day
feels like a lifetime because I've
learned so much we're actually in the
little conference room here still at the
hotel learning about the various WD
drives and Andrade we had a nice little
lesson on raid halls working on a video
right now I'm not gonna show it because
he probably wants to keep it super
secretive until it until it launches
until the big premiere 390x it's coming
right at you yeah we're just taking a
quick little 10-15 minute break right
here really nice they've got like
refreshments and stuff back there and
drinks were all very comfortable and
then I think after that yeah I think we
need lunch they've been really good
about feeding us so I'm happy
there's there's like a bowl of taffy in
front of I've received practically and
there's one like right in front of me
and I've just been picking away at it
slowly it's an evening all the time no
one else is eating its happy but I'm
gonna take your bowl to Michael we'll
find a way
look at that we good - shrimp look
at that taco night Walker moly
look at those iced teas all around look
at that Paul you are delicious
get in my mouth
please wait what did I say that all all
right so we just wrapped up the press
conference thingy it lasted quite a bit
almost all day it's about 4:30 5 o'clock
and at this point we just have some free
time to dilly-dally and whatnot until we
have dinner WD is actually inviting us
out to dinner across the street at some
fancy restaurants whose name I cannot
pronounce but in the meantime I kind of
just have some spare time to kill Paul
brought his wife so he's you know busy
you know loving her and stuff not me
that's cool that just means I'm forever
alone in it today which is fine I don't
need Paul to be entertained all right I
mean he's cool but I did just fine on my
own so I'm gonna have a blast for the
next hour and a half in here and he's
gonna be jealous that he has a loving
wife to be with today so I'm gonna go
I'm gonna go have fun I'm gonna go have
