fortunately this is actually a bit more
joyous of an occasion I'm here in the
beautiful city of laguna beach which is
of each and been invited here by the
fine folks at WD they've invited me to
their creative community summits which
is basically like this meet and greet
type thing with a bunch of other
reviewers like myself paul from paul's
hard or is actually here i think he's
probably in the room above me but
basically i am just here to talk about
WD stuff and learn more about the
products that WD is putting out this
this upcoming year and it's pretty sweet
they pay for all the travel expenses and
like like any travel vlog i do have to
do an obligatory hotel room tour so
here's the living room / bedroom it's
all kind of one room pretty nice here's
a bathroom that's really nice super nice
bathroom really fancy countertops oh
yeah so smooth and of course we've got
some weight oh wait turn the air off

bar I've got a glass see at the glass
lamp an LG TV pretty sweet bottle of
Jameson oh wait no I brought that let's
head to the balcony I'll show you the
balcony it's actually really nice we're
rolling on the second floor but and I
thought I wasn't gonna have a nice view
being so low to the ground but look
actually that's super blown out hold on
pretty snazzy we're at the surf and sand
hotel by the way I should have should
have mentioned that earlier which is a
super fancy resort I've never been here
because otherwise I have to pay for it
and I think that's the event right there
we're supposed to have a dinner at seven
o'clock it's like 705 I should probably
go down there and start mingling the
people into instead of making damn vlogs
hey look hey look it's pulling his wife
say hi guys yeah
I don't care no so we've been here all
day this is the morning after the last
clip that you saw all day it has been
all day it's 1051 and it's still morning
so on all day feels like a lifetime
because I've learned so much we're
actually in the little conference room
here still at the hotel learning about
the various WD drives and in raid we had
a nice little lesson on raid halls
working on a video right now I'm not
gonna show it because he probably wants
to keep it super secretive until it
until it launches till the big premiere
my 390 xvideo 3 90 x it's coming right
at you oh yeah we're just taking a quick
little 10 15 minute break right here
really nice they've got like
refreshments and stuff back there and
drinks were all very comfortable and
then I think after that yeah I think
we'd lunch they've been really good
about feeding us so I'm happy there's
there's like a bowl of taffy in front of

and there's one like right in front of
me I've just been picking away at it
slowly gaining the tax and eating all
the tab no one else is eating this happy
