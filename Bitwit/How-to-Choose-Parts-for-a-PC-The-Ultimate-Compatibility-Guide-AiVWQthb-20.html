you guys need a legit website for your
tech YouTube channel blog or whatever
the dot tech squad is offering $5.00 dot
tech domains until April 8th with the
code awesomesauce this is a new
initiative so many domain names haven't
been taken yet that's why I was able to
score awesomesauce Tech before any of
you guys could snag it first and try
selling it to me later
trolls go check it out I put a link in
the description ok bye what's up guys
today I'm dealing with a topic that
might not require much explaining to you
DIY veterans out there but for the
novice or first-time PC builder choosing
the parts for a PC and ensuring they're
all compatible with each other can be a
daunting task so to make life a little
easier for the young PC master-race i've
decided to throw together the ultimate
PC hardware compatibility guide the
first step is to make a list of parts on
PC port picker comm and see if you pass
the site's compatibility check if it
checks out you're done guys thanks for
watching I hope you learned a lot from
this video wait hold on
look let's back up I need to throw
together the ultimate PC hardware
compatibility guide now while a PC list
making site like PC part picker already
offers a built-in compatibility checker
after doing some research I found that
such automated systems aren't always
100% accurate especially when it comes
to gauging specific clearance parameters
or taking specialized situations into
account so hopefully by the end of this
video you'll have a greater
understanding of how various PC parts
relate to each other and thus a higher
chance of choosing all the right
hardware that being said I use PC part
picker all the time personally it's a
fantastic site that I'd recommend using
to part out you're built I'm just giving
you the necessary information in this
video that a universal algorithm can
always provide so in order to thoroughly
explain the vast network of PC part
Association I've been working with a
team of highly intelligent field mice to
develop the octagon of compatibility
these are the 8 main parts you'll most
likely need to build your next PC for
the record I've omitted optical drives
here because one they're not nearly as
relevant these days and 2 there was no
more room in the Octagon looking at the
chart you can think of each of these
parts as a puzzle piece that needs to
fit with certain other parts in the
group to make a working computer
here's what all the compatibility lines
for every part looks like and we'll be
going over each of these today now I can
tell most of you are already like this
I'm out of here
but don't saddle up just yet because I'm
gonna break it down for you all nice and
simple so that even a child or a Donald
Trump supporter can understand rather
than trying to tackle all these lines at
once let's start by talking about the
computer case and work our way around
the octagon so for starters the
relationship between cases and
motherboards is pretty simple
motherboards come in a number of sizes
or form factors but the most common ones
from smallest to largest are mini ITX
micro ATX ATX and extended ATX or EA TX
for short once you know what kind of
board you're dealing with you can look
on a cases product page to see what
types of boards it supports some cases
support more than one type of board but
I would advise against putting a small
board inside a larger case if you want
to use your system to its fullest
additionally your motherboard should
have the necessary headers for plugging
in your cases front panel connectors
this includes the elements at the front
of your case like USB ports to avoid a
lifetime of pain and sorrow take a look
at exactly what external connectors your
case is rockin
then check for the corresponding headers
on your motherboard as a quick pro tip a
single USB three header on your
motherboard can support up to two USB
ports on your case and the same goes for
a USB 2 header your GPU or video card
also needs to fit comfortably inside
your chassis first check to see how many
PCI slots your video card has then
verify that your case has the same
number of expansion slots or more these
days most cards are only two slots wide
and most cases have at least two
expansion slots so this really isn't a
big concern if anything you're more
likely to run into clearance issues with
the length of your GPU again check the
manufacturers website this time making
sure that the length of your video card
is shorter than the cases maximum
supported graphics card length the
height and thickness of the cards cooler
can also pose clearance issues but
usually that's only if you're building
inside of a toaster the CPU cooler has a
similar relationship with your case as
the GPU if you're going with a non
liquid air cooler the main thing to look
out for here is the height of the cooler
versus the cases maximum supported CPU
cooler height for all in one liquid
coolers pay attention to its radiator
size which is usually either 120 240 280
or 360 millimeters long then check to
see if the case in question supports
radiators
that particular size to guarantee cases
compatibility with a power supply there
are three factors to consider here the
first one being form factor life
motherboards power supplies come in a
variety of sizes too but the two main
types are ATX and SFX SFX is typically
only used in small form-factor cases so
unless you're building a super portable
PC chances are you'll be dealing with an
ATX power supply this is kind of
confusing since as we just discussed ATX
is also a motherboard form factor but
since they signify different
specifications it's probably best to
ignore the similarity at any rate check
both product pages to make sure the form
factor of your power supply is supported
by your case secondly you'll want to
ensure that the length of the unit meets
the requirements for your cases power
supply clearance when building in
smaller cases I like to stay well under
this limit if I can just to give some
extra room for cable management thirdly
you'll want to look out for any fan
controllers or LEDs built into your case
that require juice from your power
supply
these are usually driven by a SATA or
molex connector so make sure your power
supply has the right kind and number of
plugs the last part to consider for our
case here is storage whether they be
mechanical drives or SSDs most drives
that mount directly to your case are of
the two and a half inch or three and a
half inch variety count up how many
drives you plan to use in your build and
make sure your case has enough drive
mounts to accommodate them
be aware that many cases have Drive
mounts that support both two-and-a-half
inch and three and a half inch drives
but not concurrently unless otherwise
specified now let's move on to the
motherboard
since this component functions as kind
of a central hub it's no surprise that
it requires compatibility with every
other part on our list of course we
already discussed its association with
cases so no need to revisit that when it
comes to the motherboard and CPU the
most important factor to allow
compatibility is the socket type common
Intel sockets of today include socket
LGA 1150 1151 and 2011 - v3 these socket
types need to match exactly for there to
be a working connection no exceptions
AMD on the other hand is a bit more
flexible in this regard and that it's FM
2 plus and am3+ motherboards are
backwards compatible with older FM 2 and
AM 3 CPUs just not the other way around
still it's generally recommended to use
an AMD cpu and motherboard of the same
socket type if you're set on buying a
case
you Intel CPU for overclocking you'll
also need to check that your motherboard
chipset supports it at the moment the
popular chipsets that support
overclocking include z97 C 170 and X 99
AMD users don't have to worry as much
here since overclocking is supported on
pretty much all the main chipsets apart
from processors your motherboard also
needs to support the correct standard
capacity and speed of your RAM or system
memory most boards nowadays support
either 240 pin ddr3 or 288 pin ddr4 so
you'll need to buy a Ram kit sporting
the same type of memory if you're
choosing a kit with more than two dims
make sure the board has at least that
many DIMM slots to house them
motherboards also have a cap on how much
ram capacity they can support so if
you're opting for a 64 gig kit for
example make sure you're not buying a
board that only supports 32 gigs finally
you want to make sure your motherboard
supports the rated speed in megahertz of
your memory in order for it to operate
at its full potential in OC acronym
that's listed next to a specific speed
indicates that you'll need to manually
overclock your memory usually in the
BIOS in order to hit that specific
frequency
moving on to motherboards and graphics
cards most boards you'll find have PCI
Express slots that can accommodate any
modern GPU but for good measure you'll
want to make sure both parts are
supporting the same generation of PCIe
the current gen as of filming this video
is PCIe gen3 if you happen to be
installing multiple GPUs make sure you
choose a board that supports the same
number of cards with either sli for
NVIDIA GPUs or crossfire for AMD now
compatibility between the CPU cooler and
the motherboard is very much like the
affair between the board and CPU as long
as your cooler supports the same Intel
or AMD socket as your motherboard you're
in the clear luckily most air and liquid
cooler support the vast majority of
popular sockets but still be sure to
double check before pulling the trigger
like everything else in the PC the
motherboard gets powered by the power
supply but not every power supply has
the right connectors to power any Bourg
the first of two main plugs to consider
here is your EPS CPU connector this will
either be a four pin or more commonly an
eight pin plug on your motherboard
either way I'd recommend a power supply
with an eight pin EPS plug which is
usually split into two four pin
connectors so it can work for either
scenario the second plug to watch out
for is the larger ATX motherboard
connector which usually has 20 or 24
pins as such your power supply should
have a 20 plus 4 pin connector in order
to power your board now listen up
carefully here because compatibility
between a motherboard and your storage
configuration can be a bit tricky for
new builders to start with the basics
most SSDs and hard drives connect to the
motherboard via a SATA data cable in
order to transfer data most motherboards
have a number of SATA ports onboard for
exactly this purpose as for now the two
common speeds of this connection are
SATA 2 which features transfer speeds of
3 gigabits per second and SATA 3 with
faster speeds of 6 gigabits per second
while the average hard drive sees
virtually no performance difference from
either connection newer SSDs from the
last couple of years should always be
plugged into the faster port when
possible as an example if you picked out
four SSDs and two hard drives find a
motherboard with at least six SATA ports
four of which should be SATA 6 gigabits
per second the new kid on the block when
it comes to storage is M 2 rather than
plugging into a SATA port and MDOT to
drive mounts into an MDOT 2 slot that's
built directly into some motherboards
the form factor of MDOT two drives is
expressed with a key letter like m and a
four-digit number indicating its
dimensions so be sure to check the drive
specs and motherboard page to find out
which keys and lengths are supported but
wait there's more not all MDOT two
drives use the same data transfer
protocol the two main ones being SATA
and the newer and faster nvme PCIe now
because the world hates you some
motherboards only support one or the
other and some boards support both when
in doubt check the manufacturers website
to see what's what if you're considering
an MDOT to drive for your build I'd
highly recommend watching Paul's video
on m2 before buying your parts now
believe it or not with the case and
motherboard behind us we've already
turned through the majority of
compatibility lines here
that brings us to the CPU which really
only needs to play nicely with three
other components one of which we've just
discussed if you remember how to pair a
motherboard with the CPU and you found a
CPU cooler that supports your
motherboard by the transitive property
your CPU and CPU cooler should also see
no physical incompatibilities since all
three components support the same socket
type however there's one more
characteristic that should be paid close
attention to and that's the CPUs thermal
design power or TDP which refers to the
amount of heat that needs to be
dissipated for effective upper
should track down the TDP of your CPU
then look to see if your CPU cooler is
well cool enough to meet that
requirement if you plan on overclocking
your CPU I'd highly recommend a cooler
with a cooling capacity that exceeds the
on the box-t VP of your chip the TDP of
a CPU also gives us a general idea of
how much power it'll draw while your
power supply needs to be able to handle
the load of your CPU your video card is
usually the biggest power hog in a PC
and thus gives us a better estimate of
what wattage your power supply should be
in order to drive the whole system so
we'll circle back to this later when we
touch on the video card as we've already
gone over your memory and motherboard
have a defined set of specs that
determines their compatibility but the
relationship between your RAM and CPU
cooler isn't so cut-and-dry
this comes down to a matter of physical
clearance based on the height of your
dims and its potential to interfere with
your error liquid cooler larger air
coolers with wide heat sinks or multiple
fans can often block access to your DIMM
slots leaving no room for installing
your memory modules a couple ways to
avoid this tragedy include finding an
air cooler with high RAM compatibility
or choosing a low profile memory kit
which will greatly reduce your chance of
interference to be on the safe side you
should also research your model of CPU
cooler online to see if it's caused any
clearance issues for fellow builders all
in one liquid coolers can pose similar
clearance problems with their radiators
or radiator fans this is particularly a
concern if you plan on mounting your
radiator at the top of your case where
it could potentially hang down to low
and clash with your dims again a low
profile memory kit can do wonders here
but equally effective is choosing a case
that features either a top radiator
mount with ample spacing away from your
motherboard or radiator support on
different sides of the chassis next up
we have the video card and assuming you
were listening when we talked about case
and motherboard compatibility that
leaves us with how to select a proper
power supply for our GPU and our whole
system for that matter on the graphics
card manufacturers website it should
list in plain view the minimum
recommended power supply wattage
required to drive the entire system
safely for peace of mind
I typically opt for a unit that's about
a hundred Watts greater than this
recommendation and 150 watts greater if
I plan on overclocking my CPU and video
card if you want to find out exactly how
much power your system will draw add all
your parts to a list on PC part picker
and the site will spit out a fair
estimate
of your pc's total power consumption
before overclocking now getting back to
the GPU for a minute sufficient wattage
is only half the battle as your power
supply also needs to have the
appropriate PCI Express connectors to
power the card unless you're dealing
with the low power GPU with no PCI
connectors most cards will have a number
of them in six pin or eight pin
varieties check to see that your PSU has
a sufficient number of the correctly
sized plugs or you'll be stuck with an
overpriced paperweight keep in mind that
many power supplies feature six plus two
pin PCIe connectors which can be used
for either a single six pin or eight pin
plug on your graphics card at this point
we've talked about nearly every part
associated with the CPU cooler but there
are some rare instances where your
cooler can interfere with your power
supply this is usually only a concern in
small form-factor cases where the power
supply is mounted directly above the CPU
in order to save space in this situation
you'll need to find a liquid cooler if
your case supports it or a low profile
air cooler that's shorter than your
cases maximum CPU cooler height limit as
you guys can see there's really not much
left to say about our power supply
either other than its requirements for
storage earlier we talked about how SSDs
and hard drives require a SATA
connection to your motherboard for data
transfer
but these drives still require a second
SATA connection to receive power as such
your power supply needs to have at least
one SATA plug for every one of your hard
drives and don't forget to account for
any other elements like fan controllers
or LEDs that require SATA ports as well
finally that leaves us two storage but
by now we've exhausted all of its
various part associations thus
concluding today's lesson on the octagon
of compatibility I know this was a lot
of thick information to run through guys
and there's a fair chance that I
overlooked a few things myself so if
you're watching this video as a seasoned
PC builder please share any
compatibility tips that I might have
missed in the comments below which I'm
