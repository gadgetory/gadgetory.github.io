on the link below for more info alright
guys so this is part 2 the follow up to
the Dan case bill that I assembled for
August PC of the month I'm really
excited to actually get this on the
testbed or not on the testbed but this
is the test bed I'm excited to test it
today run some benchmarks take a look at
thermals and stuff like that but first I
want to give you guys a quick update on
the system itself because some things
have transpired since part one but I
think are worth talking about in case
you guys plan to build something like
this yourself for starters when I first
put this system together everything fit
more or less perfectly but shortly after
the side panel that goes on the side of
the the CPU here started to pop off at
the top because there are no physical
screws at the top of either of these
side panels they're just these pushpins
lammles pushpin technology that I'm not
gonna call it technology they're just
little pushpin tabs or little plastic
key things but they started to pop off
mainly because of the a i/o tubes they
were they were causing clearance issues
they're actually protruding from from
this right side of the case a bit too
far and that pressure was just causing
the the side panel to pop open the
reason why the tubes are sticking out so
much however was because of the tried NZ
heat spreaders being so tall they were
forcing this part of the tube area to
push out even more so you can see I've
actually swapped out that memory kit for
some rip jaws five sticks of the same
capacity and speed but even these sticks
are too tall however so I'll probably
have to swap these out for something
even more low-profile like Corsairs
vengeance lpx or maybe Crucial Ballistix
sport or something like that in the
meantime the side panel does fit on if I
put a small piece of tape at the top
it's definitely an eyesore and quite
literally a bandaid on the situation on
the problem but it's the best I can do
for now until we get that memory swapped
out the other issue a little quirk here
let me go ahead and turn this system
around for you so on this side we
clearly have our graphics card and a
better look at the 92 millimeter AO with
a knock to a fan right there the issue
here and you guys probably saw this if
you watch my best buy Coolermaster vlog
video which you should check out
definitely if you haven't seemed to get
it's pretty cool is the
the power supply cable says the way that
the power supply is oriented the cable
is actually plug in from the bottom of
the unit and in transport sometimes
those cables get jostled around and will
actually hang a little bit lower than
they should and that'll actually
interfere with the fan blade on that fan
causing it to not spin up which is
obviously detrimental to our CPU
temperatures so what I'm thinking here
is swapping out the cables for some
custom cables and just kind of redoing
the whole thing with some some nice
sleeved cabling and that'll also clean
up the look inside the system even
though it doesn't matter too much it's
just an aesthetic thing but I think
that'll probably solve our issue once
and for all once we get some custom
cables that are also maybe a bit more
flexible than these stock cables here so
perhaps we'll do a part three
you know usually four pin my PC or what
usually for a PC of the month will have
a two part thing going but maybe we'll
do a part three just so I can swap out
the memory fix the side panel issue and
the cable issue and maybe a couple of
the things that we'll talk about in a
moment but with that said why don't we
talk about the actual testing that's
what we're here to discuss mainly today
starting with the testing methodology I
decided to run both the CPU and the GPU
fully stuck my reasoning is pretty
obvious here it's a small case there
isn't a whole lot of cooling potential
even though we've got an a i/o which
sounds great on paper it's still just a
92 millimeter AO and the CPU the 2700 X
is 105 watt TDP chips so it it's
definitely not the coolest of the bunch
and we've got a whole eight cores and
sixteen threads on there after all so I
decided to run stock the CPU is pretty
much at that point just being handled by
the sense of my technology I'm kind of
leaving it in in AMD's hands here with
exa far to precision boost too and what
I was typically seeing during gameplay
was an all core boost to 4 gigahertz
thereabouts which is perfectly fine for
me temperatures however were not so
ideal we were actually getting around 79
to 80 degrees Celsius on average that
was kind of where we were hovering
within GTA 5 after about you know half
an hour to 45 minutes but it actually
spiked up to 88 C at one point which had
to have caused some amount of throttling
even if it was just for a second or two
because the maximum rated temp for this
chip is 85 degrees Celsius if you look
on AMD's website so that's
please something that I want to keep a
closer eye on and it also leads me to
believe that perhaps the risin 7 2700
nan X would have been a better fit for
this system now that I'm looking at the
low temperatures and stuff and had a
chance to play with it that's that's a
65 watt TDP chip it runs at a lower
clock speed out of the box slower turbos
and all that so perhaps that would be
better suited for a rig like this again
something that we can explore in part 3
our GPU on the other hand did a pretty
nice job in comparison we saw
temperatures range anywhere from 79 to
83 degrees Celsius with a max of 84 it's
definitely not the coolest I'll admit
however this is the smallest cooler I've
ever seen a manufacturer put on to a GP
102 so still very impressive we're
getting a lot of performance out of this
thing nonetheless the other thing to
note is that 84 degrees Celsius is still
well under the t.j.maxx for this
particular card and we were still seeing
a GPU core clock of 1835 at those
temperatures whereas the the official
rated goose clock for this particular
card is 1600 and 20 megahertz sister so
we were not only not thermal throttling
but we were actually getting a much
higher boost clock than what this cards
read for on the box
our GPU and CPU pairing however might
not be a 100% match made in heaven
I did notice GPU utilization was
hovering anywhere from 87 to 92 percent
as opposed to you know the ideal 99 or
100% that could be indicative of some
CPU bottlenecking
don't get me wrong the 2700 X is a
fantastic CPU but the 1080i is a blazing
fast GPU that requires pretty much
cream-of-the-crop CPU performance in
order to keep up with it we'd probably
see less bottlenecking had repaired this
card with something like Intel's Core i7
8700 K but at the same time that chip
runs a lot hotter on average than the
2700 X and in the case this thermally
constrained that'd probably be a bad
idea so all that considered I'm actually
ok with taking the minor performance hit
especially since we're able to cram all
this high-end hardware into a relatively
tiny footprint moving right along here I
was able to post our memory at it's
rated 3200 mega Hertz speed why am i
pointing the memories on the other side
and at the time of testing we use the
latest wiffle driver from Nvidia that's
three nine eight 8/2 i tested six games
at three different resolutions giving
you a total of 18 benchmarks today and
all the titles were pretty much run at
Ultra settings across
the board so but now further ado let's
go ahead and see what this little guy's
made up here are the benchmarks
all right so I don't think any of us are
surprised to see this thing absolutely
murder 1080p gaming in fact all of our
titles got 60fps or higher on average in
fact a lot higher in most titles I would
say three of the six games were 144
Hertz ready even ranging anywhere from 1
to 200 frames per second we actually hit
the the FPS cap
I believe in Doom and overwatch this
also leads us to believe that this thing
is fully capable of handling ultra wide
resolutions like 34 40 by 1440 since
that's really not a huge pixel jump over
its sixteen by nine counterpart and
finally at 4k we saw 60 FPS on average
in all but one title that one title
being ashes of a singularity because
it's kind of a dick but for the most
part 4k 60fps ultra settings in the size
of literally half a shoebox
I am absolutely floored by the
performance and just sexiness of this
mini ITX PC it's definitely my favorite
small form-factor build that I've ever
assembled personally to date and you
guys let me know if you agree or if you
think it sucks and why and all that
stuff
comment like subscribe blahdy blahdy
blah check me out on flo playing for 3
bucks a month if you'd like to watch all
my videos a whole week early without ads
I'll put a link for that in the video
description and thank you so much for
watching this video have yourselves a
good one guys
stay tuned for more stuff on the way and
I'll see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
