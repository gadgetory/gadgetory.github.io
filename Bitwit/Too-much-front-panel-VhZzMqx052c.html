optimized RGB fans and a high efficiency
ceramic bearing pump for exceptional
durability and noiseless operation click
on the link below to learn more so this
is October's PC of the month back here
again we're gonna do some testing this
time around and just to refresh your
memory we've got a core I 999 hundred K
being cooled by a dark rocket Pro for
from be quiet it's a giant air cooler
right there and our graphics card is the
Auris extreme gaming that gets extreme
gaming I get confused with GPU names
these days
RTX 2080 and this is all being enclosed
inside of the lovely silent base 801
from be quiet as the name suggests this
chassis was built first and foremost
with acoustics in mind but the issue
that I've seen with a lot of silent
cases is that they can deliver low noise
at the expense of cooling performance so
and bear in mind I mean it's got a front
panel that's more or less closed off
from the very front it does have two
relatively thin strips on the sides of
ventillation strips that you know from
the naked eye at least doesn't look like
there's a whole lot of air coming
through there but you know who's to say
so I kind of want to put the silent base
801 through its paces today in that
regard and I think we have a lot of good
example hardware to test it with because
both our CPU and GPU can get fairly warm
especially when overclocked and we will
be overclocking both of them later today
now excluding the graphics card and the
power supply I believe we have a total
of nine fans in the system we've got two
that are mounted to our be quiet dark
Rock Pro for cooler we have three 140 s
at the front three more at the top and
one at the back that being said having a
bunch of fans in your system doesn't
necessarily equal great airflow for
example if you have a constrictive front
panel or top panel then that's still
gonna limit the amount of air that your
fans are able to intake and exhaust and
that's going to affect thermals in the
long run so that's what we're up against
today that's a riff sort of testing out
mainly it's gonna be a case study if you
will on the silent bass 801 so that said
let's get to testing hope this guy
doesn't explode
all right y'all we're in GTA 5 just
hopped in we're about seven minutes in
so we're still letting the components
heat up a bit in the meantime we're at
five gigahertz on all cores for our
ninety nine hundred K that's at one
point three five volts and temperatures
right now for what it's worth in the
first seven minutes a gameplay are
maxing out at 74 see our r-tx 2080 is
currently rocking the 100 megahertz core
clock off set a 700 megahertz memory
clock offset that's of course with the
power and GPU temps lighters maxed out
we've got 100% on the voltage as well
with those settings we're currently
operating at a core clock speed of 2000
and 70 megahertz bear in mind that this
card is factory overclocked we just gave
it a bit more of a manual push there our
maximum GPU temp right now is 71 C that
is bound to climb a bit further as we
continue gaming and right now we are at
the medium fan setting on our built-in
fan controller within the silent base
801 it seems to be a nice happy medium
between acoustics and performance but
the system is dead silent right now I
mean it's literally like a foot away
from my face and I cannot hear it even
though there's no in-game audio I'm not
wearing headphones or anything it is
really really quiet so the fact that
we're getting fairly decent temps right
now is a good sign but let's see how we
do in about 15 or 20 minutes all right
so I've thoroughly pissed off the cops
at this point and I've also given our
Hardware a chance to heat up so taking a
look at our towns we've got 74c on the
GPU it's actually not bad I'll take it
of course I got a commend Oris you know
gigabyte whatever for the cooler that
they've slept on to this RT X 2080 it
seems to be doing a pretty good job but
that cooler is completely useless if
you're you know slapping it inside of a
an air constrictive case if it's
completely suffocated it's not getting
any air flow to to those GPU fans then
it doesn't matter how good of a cool you
got on there so you know cheers to the
801 as well the style of bass 801 doing
its thing as far as the CPU goes we're
hit an 82 see on the package temp now
that's not like a constant 82 see
actually the the CPU seems to be
hovering in the 60s most the time with
more occasional spikes into the 70s but
it did get to 82 at one point it was
probably just for a split second or so
which again I can live at that to you
know five gigahertz on eight cores but
air cooling is there's no easy task
and
I've also got to give it up to be quite
stark Rock pro fork for doing a nice job
there but the silent base arrow one's
ability its intake ability is really
important here because those front fans
are aimed directly at that cooler so if
you know if those front fans were
getting choked you'd probably know it
because the CPU would not be doing so
well now of course I want to actually
take these temperatures and be able to
compare them to another set of data so
what I want to do now is actually remove
the front panel of the silent base 8:01
and play another 15 minutes or so of
this game and then we'll circle back
that way we can sort of compare and see
how much of a difference or how much are
these fans really being choked
our temperatures might be good now but
comparatively speaking if our
temperatures drop you know 20 degrees
after removing that front panel then you
know it's it's really not as great of a
picture as we're painting it out to be
right now so let me remove the front
panel really quick and I'll check with
you guys in a bit alright so it's been
about 25 minutes and our temperatures
have definitely changed since removing
that front panel for starters our r-tx
2080 is now maxing out at 69 degrees
Celsius which is down five-seat from
when the side panel or when the front
panel was on whether or not that
significant I guess it depends on who
you ask
what I can say is that our core clock
speed has not changed we are still
operating at 2070 megahertz there's
absolutely zero change to the speed of
the card regardless of the temperature
difference however that's not to say
that if you had different hardware in
this case that the changes would be
significant you might see a bit of a
bump there on your core clock frequency
moving on to the CPU we went from 82
degrees Celsius on the Mex package temp
down to now is 68 that being said you
also have to sometimes look at these max
temperatures any max values as outliers
because as I mentioned before during the
initial test with the front panel on we
were operating in the 60s most of the
time we only hit 82 see like for a
fraction of a second and then it went
right back down to 65 or whatever so
what I should focus on are just sort of
the the current sort of average
temperatures and right now we're
actually hovering in the 50s more or
less with occasional bumps into the 60s
what that tells us is that we have
dropped on average anywhere from 7 to 10
three Celsius on our CPU simply from
removing that front panel and that I
would say is pretty significant now
granted it's not like we were thermal
throttling before but this is just one
scenario and someone who's running you
know extra hot hardware let's say a 79
80 XC that they're trying to overclock
to 5 gigahertz for example that's 7 to
10 degree difference with the front
panel on or off it could mean the
difference between thermal throttling
and knots so that's something to bear in
mind if you're going extreme
overclocking and thermals are a primary
concern as opposed to silence or
acoustics then maybe the silent bass 801
isn't the case for you what I will say
is if you are getting this case and
you're throwing in some high-end
hardware especially if you plan to
overclock those components that I would
ensure that you have a pretty beefy CPU
and GPU cooling solution that's
independent from the chassis because you
don't want to rely just on the case to
do all of your important cooling with
the system's current configuration I
would feel comfortable using the system
on a daily basis gaming and editing but
if I was cramming in some some heavier
duty Hardware in here and I was trying
to really push the hardware to its
limits then I would probably look for a
case that had maybe more open
ventilation at the front panel to take
more advantage of those intake fans
those are my findings for today
