awesomesauce news welcome back to the
channel and today I'm going to be doing
an unboxing and overview and even a
quick little demo of this game pad from
SteelSeries this is their free mobile
wireless controller and despite the name
you are going to have to pay money to
buy this guy but still interesting name
nonetheless that's what they're calling
it and basically this is just the
gamepad for your your your mobile
devices so either your smartphone
whether it be Android or iOS even will
work for PC and Mac as well I'm pretty
sure most of you will probably using a
keyboard and mouse if you're going to be
gaming on those platforms but it is
still an option so I'm gonna be doing a
demo with my smartphone it's a it's an
Android phone so I'm going to be taking
it out in just a bit and testing it out
to see how it actually all works but
it's pretty straightforward uh than that
like I said Android iPod Touch iPhone
and get their iPad PC and Mac it does
connect to those devices via bluetooth
so you won't be tethered to any wires
when using this product which is always
nice and it does have a rechargeable
lithium-ion battery so ten hours of
intensive gaming 20 hours of casual time
not too shabby at all on the back there
isn't much bunch of a description that
I'm going to go over in just a bit and a
couple diagrams showing you yes it does
connect to these devices wirelessly and
that's the the gamepad layout which I'm
going to show you right now I quickly
want to go over some of the accessories
included with this device so first off
you get your Quick Start Guide complete
with all kinds of pictures to help you
through getting started to use this guy
teaching you what different modes that
you can enter into and pretty much the
layout of the device comes in multiple
languages as well you also get a
pamphlet with other SteelSeries products
listed on it such as their headphones
SteelSeries sticker for I don't know
representing steel series I guess
anywhere you'd like and you also get a
micro USB charging cable to charge your
device that is and lastly for the
accessories you do get a steel series
fabric pouch it's very nice it's got a
zipper sealant on it right there good
for storage and travel alright guys
here's the game pad itself and I don't
know if you can tell in the video but it
does have a very nice matte black finish
all around it does even have a rubbery
grip to it so that you know you don't
accidentally slip this guy
I added your hands when you're gaming it
does have a very similar design as a
playstation controller as opposed to the
Xbox controller where there's a joystick
up here and one down here you kind of
get both of them leveled down below here
with the d-pad at the top left you can
have the four buttons here to kind of
emulate the X square triangle and circle
buttons or you know a B X Y if you're
talking Xbox and you do have a left and
right bumper up here two buttons so keep
in mind this guy is extremely small it
fits pretty much in the palm of your
hand so if you have really massive hands
this might not be the best option for
you but it really is probably the most
compact device compact gamepad for that
matter that I've seen on the market so
far so if you are holding it's generally
speaking my index fingers kind of
gravitate towards the center right here
for the the two bumper buttons which is
perfectly fine I think that's actually
whether intended to hit from because you
can still hit them from the outside but
the more outer of the controller you go
it gets significantly harder to press
the buttons from from the sides now the
a and B buttons are kind of interesting
the B button on in one end in one regard
is just there for you to map a function
to in game so I usually map it as my
pause button so I can just quickly pause
the game when I'm playing it but it also
ties into it works in tandem with the a
button in some ways so the a button for
one is a power button if you hold it
down for three seconds what LED will
start blinking indicating that the
device has been turned on and then it'll
continue blinking in a certain way as
you can see so it's doing a single blink
right now and that blink is actually
indicating that this device is currently
in gamepad mode now you want to be in
gamepad mode if you're going to be using
this device with any Android device or
PC or Mac if you want to go use this use
this guy with an iOS device for example
you're going to need to switch to arcade
mode and the way you do that is you hold
a and B down for three seconds until the
LED light indicates that you've switched
to arcade mode but before you do that
you need to do it when the device is
powered off so I'm going to hold down
the a button again to make sure the
device is completely powered down and
then you want to hold down a and B for
three seconds until it boots up again
and now you can see the LED is actually
doing a double blink and that's going to
that basically indicates that you're in
arcade mode so now you can go ahead
use this with an iPhone iPad or iPod
Touch for that matter so it's pretty
much it
I think I pretty much covered all the
basics for the controller design layout
so with that said why don't we test this
guy out with my Android smartphone all
right guys I know I said we were going
to do a gaming demo right now and we
still are but I did really quickly want
to show you how quick and easy it is to
pair this to your smartphone so like I
said I have my android phone right here
I would test this on multiple devices if
I had any more than this phone but
unfortunately this is all I have right
now so you want to turn bluetooth on go
into your additional settings your
additional Bluetooth settings and wait
for the available devices to show that
that gamepad the gamepad should pop up
there it is z mote SteelSeries free
you're gonna tap that make sure you
always tap that and now you can see it
is paired alright let's move on to the
gaming demo this is the moment you've
all been waiting for I'm going to load
up dead trigger it's a pretty awesome
game for your Android device I think
they also have it for iOS devices as
well but this is one of the games that
is compatible with this gamepad here and
if you want a list of all compatible
games I'm going to put a link in the
description below you can go ahead and
check that out it's just a SteelSeries
website I will let you know what games
you can actually play with this guy
regardless of which platform you might
be playing it on so right here i'm kind
of already in the menu here i'm going to
go to options and you'll see that the
custom gamepad option has has come has
appeared down here so you're gonna hit
custom game pad now that's that's pretty
much just an option because that option
only appeared because i've connected
this device to it otherwise it wouldn't
really show up and that's pretty much
going to be true to any compatible game
for this devices you're going to have a
list of mapping options for all of your
keys for all of your buttons and all of
your functions in the game so you can
see i've already mapped you know my fire
button to button seven which is the
right bumper and in the Quick Start
Guide it'll tell you what number each of
these buttons are labeled as so
everything's like you know this is like
button three this is button four but
it's all it's all in the Quick Start
Guide so just reference that but it
really is pretty effortless to map these
so you can just
tap on whichever one you want to change
so I can just with this guy just tap
here and it just remapped it to button
seven still the same but just an example
of how easy it is to map all the the
different key functions to the game and
yeah but that's that's the boring stuff
right let's get the boring stuff out of
the way and let's move on to the game
itself so I'm going to save and exit
here go back and let's see is that close
enough for you guys can you actually see
the screen I know it's really a forward
reflective um I'm at a new place and I'm
still figuring things out
hopefully I'll fix that very soon
probably by the next video oh I'm
getting I'm getting killed how do i how
do I do this I have no idea oh he bit me
he bit my hand
up now this guy's biting me I'm doing
really bad at this game I was put myself
in a bad spot I probably shouldn't have
paused at that moment but here you can
see I'm actually I'm actually killing
fools and it looks like this controller
is working beautifully actually it's
very responsive there's no input lag
whatsoever it's just instantaneous and
it's actually not as horrible as I
thought it would pick up sorry when I
first saw it I was like this is way too
small to even function but you know it's
working pretty fine for me and I feel
like well this is my third time using it
for I guess like a five minute period
and and already I'm kind of getting the
hang of it so I feel like if I were to
play it or use it even more it would
become even more natural all in all it's
a very straightforward very
straightforward very simple easy to use
and highly effective little game pad I
don't know why I'm showing you my phone
we're talking about this now
go I want but that's that's going to do
it for this overview guys once again
this has been steel series free mobile
wireless controller once again it was
not free that's just the name of it but
