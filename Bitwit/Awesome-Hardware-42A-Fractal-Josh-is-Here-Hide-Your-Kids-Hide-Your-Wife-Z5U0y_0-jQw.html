yet we still have a chance until the
picture shows up you still have a chance
right okay very good to know very true
Thank You Josh Thank You Troy also we
have we're still taking submissions for
a new awesome hardware logo that is
going to be fan submitted by one of you
beautiful people out there so you can go
ahead and email awesome hardware rules
at gmail.com just the way it sounds that
is spelled we are gonna be putting this
design potentially or getting
inspiration from the winners design and
putting it on a future shirts in both of
our stores so go ahead and send us your
best and you don't have to be like a
Photoshop guru I mean you can just send
this like something some basic thing
that you wrote on a napkin you know if
you don't know shit about computers
which why are you walking you the show
to learn about computers obviously but
go ahead and we love seeing the fan arts
actually had a couple good ones that
I've shared with Paul recently but we're
still taking more giving you guys some
more time to come out with those
speaking of awesome part of our merch
there is an awesome hardware sweat
sweatshirt swap shop where all of the
awesome hardware gear is being made very
it's very profitable for game consumer
friendly price if you guys do an awesome
hardware paraphernalia for yourself
right now though we've got a sweater
that's available this is just the basic
logo it's available on both Kyle's store
in my store SoCal stores awesome stuff
it really accentuates the nipples it
does yeah our faces go right over your
nipples cows gotta do action than if it
gets cold that's right the store very
popular shirts use offer code over 50
between now and Christmas on Kyle store
or my store to get 10% off all orders

here long variety to be here okay
so we'll make this a holiday tradition
oh yes um I should say thanks to pup
shepherd who tossed a little donation
there and chat guys if you're if you're
in if you're watching on YouTube because
we're streaming to twitch and YouTube
and you happen to make a donation we
will try to make note of that oh we
might not mention it right away
if we're in the middle of something but
we'll try to come back to those stores
in this story yes that's not necessary
by any means at all but they must donate
if you want to continue watching the
show that's true at least everyone
twenty-five dollars become an extortion
attend the show dies unless we get fifty
dollars in the next 22 minutes I am NOT
streaming to YouTube guys if you want to
watch on YouTube we're streaming -
Kyle's channel right now yes that's
awesome sauce Network yeah yes okay but
a URL is slash awesome sauce music
actually you can type in awesome sauce
Network and still works
Josh is the white girl Jones white James
or James Earl Jones yeah I got the white
part down just that's formal tea okay
alright so what's your first thing my
first segment is to fund or not to fund
bring it back we haven't done this one
in a while but a little spin on this
particular segment where we take a look
at different Kickstarter campaigns or
just any crowdfunding campaign for that
matter and we decide whether or not they
are worth our valuable dollars this is
the not to fund addition because I
thought all the ones that I found today
we're absolutely
so this first one is called the cefiro
and we've actually taken a look at a
product that's similar to this just in
the fact that it was a razor blade it
was the laser razor which had its own
controversy attached to it for not
actually working the way it was intended
to in the video group the laser razor
but this is actually a different type of
razor that doesn't use a laser I'm
saying laser and razor a lot it uses a
sapphire blade so sapphire supposed to
be super impenetrable and super sharp
like an iPhone like an iPhone like an
iPhone what's that I read these comes
your house and saves you monster will
like sapphire heads iPhone if you want
maximum sapphire I never I never buy a
buy a razor from a clean-shaven man so
and would be a great candidate for that
but this is basically I don't know
what's what's there to say about this
other than it's made of sapphire the
blade itself will last anywhere from six
to twelve months okay knowing how
marketing goes usually it's probably
like six months because all these
gimmicky razors you could buy when you
could be buying this sapphire baby
whales you need one really really
expensive this is absolutely so is this
this is like a lifetime product is that
what they're advertising here you spend
one no one lower price of $200 and you
never need another razor that's right so
by the way this is $200 like Paul said
one blade will only last six to twelve
months so Fortuner dollars okay granted
you don't have to buy you you can buy
replacement cartridges which aren't an
additional two hundred instead as the
Kickstarter states it costs less than
$49 which is a really weird which we're
guessing it doesn't cost less than $48
exactly to use that exactly know one of
the greatest uses of technology over the
past few years not curing cancer
you know the Mars rover it's letting you
do something you've already done all
your life yeah you know my solution is
to this is just buy a cheap razor and
never change the blade I haven't changed
my blade in like a year and I still I
mean that's probably so clean shave it
right now that's why it's mostly ceased
to work at all that's right hey works
for me so I'm gonna say no I'm not gonna
fund that let's move on to our next
equally horrible the you idea I thought
this was called the u P because its
title was cut off in the little and a
little tab tell me that sound like a
mobile pap smear device designed for
voyeurs is the mobile pregnancy you
never know when you might have to check
your shit up Sam so this is a microp a
microscope a professional microscope for
your smartphone so it connects to it
wirelessly there's apps and shit that
you can use with it it provides anywhere
from 35 to 350 X magnification 1 point 4
micrometer resolution 4 hour battery
life it's water-resistant costs $100
why would you need this well that's a
good question yeah I don't think anyone
needs this for those two girls didn't
look like scientists that looked like
what were they examining it looks like
one girl was like
all right let me let me show you guys
you guys can't hear audio don't have
audio so one girls on the steps and
she's like I'm trying to take a picture
of the concrete and I can and the other
girls will let me help you by giving you
this device to put on there and then and
then look at this detailed picture of
the concrete okay you're gonna have the
best Instagram photo ever you can use it
all up with three different filters
advisin filter maybe there was like an
image of Jesus in the concrete right
there that she was trying to take
picture she want to capture it because
I'm sure clean labs are running to grab
their cellphone they don't have like a
you know single purpose acquitting it
these are sperm samples what is you know
we're gonna see Nexus like Forensic
Files well we thought he was innocent
but Bubba had his magnifying glass on a
cell phone it's a Nokia's anyone can be
a crime scene investigators okay you
with the micro-p would you do you call
this and you that's a good as I say you
peek Micro people that's the sign for
micro that is a sign for micro but often
it's like either way it's kind of creepy
it's like leave it in the window of a
strange lover's house and you remotely
through walls
what is she using it to do their happy
I've got a random question it gets
wrapped how often does the average
person just need a microscope at a
moment's notice exactly I mean like how
often you're home shit I wish I had a
microscope right now look at all these
images you get thinking to get a
close-up look of a silkworm like is the
Internet not enough of a time sink
already like if you're at the dinner
table you're bored well it's like a
microscope shit and not be bored now
yeah like certain Internet era scopes
its worst thing ever brought to you live
from my bellybutton
periscope in your nose I know what this
is for actually I meant by I know what
this is for this is for like did like a
bug's life it's like for a bug's life
for them to do like selfie periscopes
that's your gramma Guinness oh my head
lice my pet head lice is gonna periscope
down a night all the viewers
we're on the UK and give me a sec this
is fabulous use of technology needless
to say we've already spent too much time
on both of these products combined so
let's move on to the third one which is
the cat clutch LED purse now you have to
play the video here to get really get
the full effect of the the breath of
ingenuity that goes into this device it
is a clutch purse so this is something
apparently women use to tote things
around but this one as you can see has
LEDs on it too and also a built-in
battery charger they don't specify the
milliamp waters ooh that's really weird
that I think it was eleventeen missile
weapon team Nami amps which is a very
standard number these days and you can
even customize to say things like bio
roofies own high maintenance or whatever
it is so yeah I mean this obviously this
is kind of like a fun maybe gift that
you could buy for a young girl because
it's only $300
what yeah nothing screams attention
whore like a walking beside your clutch
you know and that's another aspect of it
is too it's like you know good luck
trying to hide your shit on the way back
to the car you know it's like flashing
like search someone hacks it to read off
the contents in tampons 42 dollars in
cash and some Altoids you know you see
that you're like there's some good shit
in there 10 to 12 hours of battery life
though yeah I mean it's LEDs as a five
six that'll last almost until the walk
machine can get home like me to ride
this wave your purse around could you
try to do the walking shoes right but
then like the things blinking so
everyone joined by Sarah your purse
tarts extorting you I know what you did
I will text all your friends that's so
cute
it just seems like with the cat though
that's cute like okay you see that seam
right there would you ever walk into
that bar you walk up to the door you see
the streets yeah boy what does it say
about you okay coach Emilie Vuitton they
have expensive bags right but it doesn't
really scream it out because there's
knockoffs like if you got a purse that
cost $300 the mentality be you've got
some money inside purse
it just seems like a hey bug me and
here's what you need to grab this
flashing thing or even if you've got
five dollars on the purse mugged me and
then sell the person for 300 bucks I
don't know if I was a girl that mine
would just say empty you'll just keep
running
sad face there's nothing in here so yeah
go ahead and pick up one of those lady
pics like three bucks so that was the
not to fund addition thank you very much
why don't we go ahead and move on to our
next segment which is pin my PC the
blatant ripoff segment from Matt
Philly's pimp my setup thank you Matt
for giving us this genius idea that we'd
love to rip off thanks Mike and make our
own so he lives in a shed now so you
guys probably push them out of the house
but you can check it out a swashing TV
on youtube does a really great show
there but we're to be talking about more
PC driven aspect of things so I think
Paul has the first one lined up from
Eric should you should you totally do
Eric what kind of system is this well
it's not a fractal case so Josh
automatically fails it all right yeah
let's get that out of the way everything
that's not fractal er we assume I hate
right this isn't an tech not a p180 it's
one of the newer ones but not the newest
ones because I had the P 180 but it did
not have a painted interior so maybe
that's not a P I don't know but it's not
one of the newest ones cuz these these
pull out drive cages in the middle they
phased those out said he found this case
in the trash okay so where every an
check case belongs am i right Joshua I
have no comment I know they can bridge
I'm joking I'm just trying to pull
you're on there but um yeah okay yeah I
mean what would we what would you guys
change about this other than the stock
cooler maybe and some cable management
yeah I think I think you have a bit of
green here with the power supply and the
the GeForce logo going across that
because I go with that I know I think
that's that's perfectly fine I think the
Noctua fans kind of awkward just because
it's kind of sticks out like a sore
thumb
yeah it doesn't match the color scheme
at all right obviously the ketchup and
mustard cables going into your here
24-pin ATX and stuff like that maybe
swap those out for some black extensions
maybe get some PCI you wants to go along
with it while you're at it but overall I
mean it's pretty solid bill I think
maybe a nice just Arab sand
air shock air cooler for that cpu of
yours the 4770k might look a lot better
it's also probably to be a lot quieter
than the stock fan if you're gaming when
that thing ramps up its it can be pretty
noisy but 16 gigs of ram everything else
looks pretty solid yeah I if I so if
this is one of the in tech cases that
I'm familiar with there is no side panel
window so okay visually speaking it's
one of those kind of big tall monolith
cases actually look I like the look of
these cases just because they're kind of
that standard told us that they they
have sort of a minimalist quality to
them only we do I don't know what I'm
sorry I forgot fractal it was the only
one we have been in word actually so
yeah I'd say the upgrades to make here
would be functional ones which is of
course the CPU cooler there other
aesthetic stuff like even swapping those
cables out like extensions or something
like that if you're never gonna see it I
wouldn't bother to be honest cable
management could use a little bit of
tidying up but this is also a difficult
case to cable management but yeah yeah
and this actually brings up an
interesting question that I'm curious to
know what you guys think if you do if
you're rocking a case that doesn't have
a side panel window and no one can see
the inside of it anyway does it matter
what it looks like on the inside to you
personally I will say yes but that's
because I even if I'm putting a side
panel like the the bill that the the
streaming system that we've been using
over here I built and I knew it was
gonna outside town I was gonna and I
wasn't gonna see the inside but I made a
video of it so it is visible to a
certain degree so I like to have it
cleaned up I like to have the cables
tidy if there's if there's a mess of
cables even if it's in an area where
there's no airflow like I've still I
have a little bit of OCD to me about
that like I'm just I want a bunch those
up I wanna write I want it to look like
I did something I made some effort for
that I got a flip side for you is to see
that day I think on Twitter do you do
your cable management up front or once
you get everything built booted loaded
blah blah blah you come back to it so
you basically do we do a test boot
before we start playing everything well
yeah like because I'd like I've even
done it on bench like we're gonna test
food everything's fine you build the
system you won't waste the case you do
everything the way you want to do it
right and it's like some doesn't work
that son of a bitch you know honestly I
rarely ever do test
it's nowadays like usually I'm just
trying to live dangerous I I'm on the
edge
don't push me but I don't know you did a
test boot for hotline though I did do a
test boot for hotline I kind of had to
everything was done in like really small
series you know piece by piece but
usually if I'm building a system
especially if it's just like a quick
four hundred dollar budget bill like I
did recently it's just like it's faster
for me to just I mean all of us are
probably so used to building systems at
this point where we can just build them
and tear them down pretty quickly so it
doesn't really cost me that much if if I
if I if I build it and something doesn't
work I just troubleshoot it it's
actually nice to sometimes troubleshoot
a system once it's all built up because
you test more components that way to a
certain degree but as far as I kept
tying things down like actually or
finalizing your well usually make sure
that it posts before I you know tie it
tie everything down sell and chat and I
agree with him here says and thanks for
being here and modding his cell by the
way he plans the cables out beforehand
and then he fixes what he needs to after
and I think that's probably along lines
of what I do I like to if I know where
everything's gonna go I like to start
cinching stuff down early like if I know
the 24 pins gonna be here like you know
sometimes I'll get that kind of stuff
routed out usually like there is some
end of the build cable management that
always come back it's got like 60 70
percent of the way there
yes branch it off but sometimes it's
very convenient to do a little bit of it
along the way but you have you have to
have a game plan you have to know what
the end result is gonna be it's it's
nice to twist tie something first and
then because you can always add to it
later and then once you're finalized
then you can remove the twist tie
replace of the zip tie a good one too so
yeah this is turn from pip Mac PC into
like to building to building tips ask me
another segment the crashing cat that
would be good it's bad so thank you for
that Eric let's move on to the next one
Mike he's on the side there's an image
or link hold on yes sorry I forget to
link that one but okay so you've got a
Xigmatek case it looks like you don't
get too many of those these days
meet lurch you've named it lurch that's
kind of
no that was meat lurch like any eighty
I'm like that's interesting I don't know
if I want to eat it looks like the case
lives on its side like this that's what
he does because it is a tower stove at
least on the ground at least it's on the
floor
that's true yeah you do got do some dual
coolers there that's a pretty beefy air
cooler your power supply is a NASA
I don't know how reliable as if power
supplies are I don't know if it's 80
plus or not oh yeah it is it is a plus
so I guess that's that's good hello look
at this
I love his heatsink mounting for the
CPUs have you seen have you gotten to
that point yeah yeah oh wow you've known
the Lynas route this is a method that I
have used has lanús done this as well
yeah you get to in one of those builds
because they lost the hard work okay
I've used this to secure an old graphics
card heat sink fan back under the
graphics card and it's like you feed one
zip tie through and then you take the
other one and you pop it on the top
right and you can sip the two ends off
too and it actually cleans it up a
little bit as well but um these have
been left on
I have great appreciation for that
though so it's a super microserver board
and must be dual Zeon's or something
like that yeah it is just there no super
micro board yeah you're right he said he
has all right here's the specs to Zeon
55 20s and 2.2 gigahertz a couple of
hyper 212 Evo's Super Micro x8 - I
motherboard a gtx 960 4 gig 16 gigs of
ECC server memory 128 gig SSD 500 gig
laptop hard drive some miscellaneous
fans and the Xigmatek spirit w case but
he he put this whole this is a this is
like a scrapyard or worse built like a
Franken bill yeah I put this whole thing
together for 500 bucks that's pretty
that's pretty damn good
given that price point I'm that's pretty
cool now there were some people in the
comments that were saying that you might
get some melting issues possibly with
the zip ties but I think at the clock
speed that he's running these chipset as
someone might have mentioned that I
don't think that would be an issue but
it's something to consider seriously if
you're gonna be over
we chip like a ski or something like
that but this is a nice workaround for
for this particular setup and as far as
pimping goes I think we've pimped many
servers yeah servers or server parts or
like five hundred dollar budget builds I
mean we've done a few of them here and
there this is probably the best shot to
look at just cable management wise yeah
I don't know I mean I feel like pimping
this you got to invest more money in it
than would that we kind of take it
outside don't think they're like oh you
get like a 24-pin you get a couple
graphics pen extensions already up to
like close to a hundred bucks and yes
yeah the price yeah entire system and
again there's no there's no window on
the side panel so it's not a whole lot
to see I would say again from the OCD
side of it you know you could you could
pull back some more of these cables
around here you could pull some more
stuff kind of back behind the
motherboard tray since there is some
space this these little hangers out here
you know just just time up get them out
of the way so they're not visible when
you open the case and that would clean
things up a little bit beyond that I
mean I think you have a very nice bang
for the buck going on right there make
make all the fans blue translucent LED
fans oh yeah
done consistency throughout impt thanks
Larry oh dog well doesn't thank you
thanks Mike all right moving on to Dan
dan what do you got dan dan has a
slipknot
this is transitioning the peasant
rebuild so a former console peasant
moving to the PC gaming space
welcome storm enforcer case welcome it's
nice here I mean looking all brooding
and that the blest areas yeah okay a
strong theme you've gone so far Steven
remove the power supply label so it's
probably clashing before but you took
that off so thank you also the dims sir
matching perfectly with that Corsair
Vengeance indeed and yeah you've got it
looks like you have been methodical with
picking out the parts here you even got
like a really black and neutral video
card there to match and blend in really
nicely there are some cable issues here
some blacks leaving or maybe some black
and red sleeving like Capon waddles up
some really good prepackaged stuff that
you can check out I think fantex also
might have some sleeving
in store
or you can go you know to the
professionals or whatever and get some
some new troe custom stuff but I think
for what you have right here just
getting something prepackaged would be
nice also just maybe a different cooler
again Intel stock cooler looks like it
yeah dan dan says he's hoping for a
hyper 212 evo for Christmas that'd be
good definitely been a nice upgrade
there wouldn't match quite as much but
um yeah all core I'll still support it
because it's so much better than the
stock cooler you'll love this is like
like he's some attention to detail
there's red zip ties going on from where
he's right at some of these cables and
and he took the sticker off of the stock
cooler and stuff there's still some
cables floating around here like this
one that seems to be coming over here
for this fan yeah feel like if they
rotated that fan maybe you could wrap
that cable up here and get rid of it and
tie up maybe and feed it down through
here where it will be hidden a little
bit more or I mean if you're if you're
doing an upgrade on this in the future
and you want to use existing cables II
know they're ugly like consider some
cheap sleeving like it's really it's not
too difficult to pop the cap off right
slides up sleeping on and puts a little
connectors back in so that might be
something to consider and then I'd say
definitely do something maybe about this
cable management situation down here at
the bottom yes the full-blown says yes
yeah
it's it's not terrible but it could
definitely be improved agreed yeah thank
you looks like the right direction yeah
definitely nice build Dan next up we've
got Chris Chris no Phantom Chris Dolph
Chris Hobson that's an i5 4690k 4.6
gigahertz gigahertz nice overclock EGA
960 for the win 16 gigs of ram and and
NZXT s340
alright so ooh the color coordination
here is is all like black whiteness Lou
is that what I'm getting yeah for a
second but not even ready blue parole
but not even just like this so we got we
got two different sets of memory we got
a blue hyper x kit and a reg kit there's
blue accents and the heat sinks on the
motherboards and there's blue cables for
the power supply I don't know what power
supply that is down there those are some
that's some terrible painter believing
yeah I mean you get some bad cable
Swedish tank
yeah like you got the Badger gliding
cables leaving but at least it's black
this is blue and it looks terrible yeah
so yeah those are all different colors
of blue slightly that's like one of the
problems that most people face like even
Jays doing his rebuilding skunk works
like I want to do orange but what shade
of horns like when you go with some more
like a black like black it's black and
white for those parties is white pretty
close gonna be very specific yeah he
getting like the reds and blues and I
was telling you I went through like a
half a dozen different types of pink for
hotline before I actually found the one
that that was gonna work with the fluid
that I got so it's definitely a
challenge and you know for for PC
manufacturers there's a for the hardware
there's different shades in itself so
like the blue on your motherboard
doesn't necessarily match perfectly with
the blue and your RAM
there's though ways that kind of that
sky-blue versus like the really
traditional dark almost of royal blue
and that's where like an electric blue
yeah yeah exactly so I think you kind of
just have to stick with one of the other
so far it looks like you have more blue
in the system than red I mean if you had
to go one way or another so maybe I
don't know but you know if you like the
red and blue theme which I'm not a
personal fan of but if it's your system
if you like it then at least make all
the blue match and yeah because it the
second image of it there's clearly some
blue LEDs going on yeah when it lit up
it's I don't know this looks extremely
blue so I'd say I'd say go with that if
you swap out the red memory kits and get
cable extensions I think it will do
wonders for the code I even say for like
the GPU power cable just make that black
I mean with the way that you have to
sneak it up through that case you know
it's gonna kind of stand out as you make
it black just gonna blend in and when
you look at through the window you don't
really see the color of the sleeving
anywhere else so if you do the black
it's gonna kind of visually disappear
more right yeah how is it that blue did
you tend to this it's a pretty even blue
no just the way the camera picked it up
or maybe I mean who knows maybe this is
a little Photoshop color tinting
afterwards I'm not sure probably not
bloom in the back
okay but yeah there's that's Chris you
swap out that mismatched memory cake get
some cable extensions and its profit and
tight next oh I don't say next shirt all
right next up is David Rodriguez Habib
who sends this over look a custom
painted a CPU cooler looks like a custom
painted windforce bracket here on the
side of the wind force cooler some
accents on the fan appears these are
sleep decks tensions for your CX 750m
memory matches a chipset heatsink on the
motherboard obviously blue is what
you're going for I here's what surprises
me with some of these clearly some
effort has been put into your custom
painting has been going on but the power
supply it still has all these green
accents and I feel like painting this or
painting this is a lot more effort than
taking these stickers off true well are
you getting back into the blue matching
blue like if you want to repaint the RAM
or the heatsink on the motherboard and
maybe paint those closer to that color
blue right yeah that could help there's
a these are cougar fans apparently yeah
I don't know what case is this do we
know do we know anything more about this
but I would also be conscious of what
kind of paint you're using for that
heatsink because unless it's like
thermal conductive or whatever it could
be impeding some performance and I'd be
curious to see you know actually how
much it does cuz you could very well
just paint it with whatever like
toys-r-us paint you find and if it's
like a one degree or two degree
difference then I guess that something
is so bad but I would just double check
to make sure that your temps are okay I
would I would guess that he only paint
at the top of it otherwise look at that
almost from the side and it looks like
you might have done the fins maybe that
was a reason I don't hopefully not the
fins I mean right just the top would
have been enough obviously your fans are
gonna hide the rest yeah it's just the
top then there's less to worry about
there but
yeah I agree with fall completely take
the green sticker off the power supply
kill management's pretty good a blue yes
everyone looks good I like I like all
the drives you got in there this the
system is filled out pretty well but
yeah that's it's weird so much attention
to detail but but the neglect of the
power supply thing yeah very nice build
there David thank you David and that's a
pretty much as it's for Pitt my PC for
today thank you guys for sending those
in if you guys didn't get a chance to
have your build featured I will be
taking submissions next Tuesday when we
do this again so thank you let's go
ahead and move on to tech news yay tech
news our first story is about micron and
their new GDD are six and some more
details that have come to light on that
for one it's got twice the bandwidth of
gddr5 and we can into specifics but
first I mean what is GTR 6 it's it's a
new it's a new form of video RAM
essentially that's kind of made to
compete with HP n because HP m has been
really popular lately with the fury
cards and AMD and stuff like that but
GTA r6 obviously is a successor to gddr5
and the memory bandwidth essentially is
anywhere from 10 to 14 gigabits per
second now if you know your video card
details nitty gritty stuff that's
comparatively to 7 gigabits per second
of four four gigabit gddr5 and eight
gigabits per second data rate of eight
gigabit gddr5 so based on the type of
gddr5 you have that also affects the
total memory bandwidth essentially we're
getting about double the speed or double
the bandwidth I can say with GD or six
so are they I'm seeing two names for it
here in the article gd-r gd-r v and a
DDD r6 and gddr5 X is are they taking
the gddr5 X and naming it GD v or six I
don't know I didn't read that part of
the article
words are hard words are hard and I
don't do them well so it appears it's
doubling the prefetch buffer so that
that's that's good
yeah I think speed things up I guess I
guess that is GG vr6
oh yeah it's maybe there maybe this is
some slightly older material with
new Neumann clay sure that they're using
or something like that yeah
but yeah so here's they've gotten a
convenient chart here though you can see
gddr5 is this green line which is flats
5x is a line moving up which means it's
a guy rock alright so yeah I guess this
is kind of nice for for next year since
HBM 2.0 is not really it's still in
development it's not quite ready yet so
this will this will be this will make
things interesting or maybe maybe more
of a stop is it is it like a stopgap
it's exactly 5 nh' p.m. okay so you read
my notes better than I do pause okay
thank you for that and that's all I have
to say about that
oh good yeah they're done things are
done next moving on we've got
battlefield 5 confirmed from dice this
is actually exciting to some people but
not everyone the next battlefield they
are going to be so this is not
battlefront it's a battlefield
battlefield ok right so they just got
done with battlefront essentially they
just launched it and now surly
oh yes deployed went off they went
Activision ubisoft on that shit i should
say but they're basically pulling back
some of the resources that were poured
into battlefront and they're
reallocating them to the next
battlefield that's coming up it's gonna
be a return to the military settings so
unlike battlefield hardline where you
had kind of like cops and criminals type
of thing if they kind of deviated from
the from the norm of the franchise
they're going back to the military
setting which I guess is pretty expected
and you can expect the game holiday 2016
unless unless there's any kind of future
delays things like that that waterfowl
this just this is this is annoying
because it means that this is another
game that we have to buy not really play
just for benchmarking well good question
you guys played battlefield before I did
when it first came out for like a couple
months and I completely dropped off I
think I've ever actually played I have
played a certain section of battlefield
for many many many times I'm really good
at 1la benchmarking so in the campus
a horrible screenshot though what are
they trying to show with the screen she
looks like she G Chivas and some fog and
we did all the things in this one if you
needed to picture after this story to go
along with speaking of gta5 the new DLC
launched today Josh and I were watching
some videos or earlier oh my goodness it
looks amazing
you can buy yachts like really really
huge massive yachts now that have like
two helipads on them
forgive us without systems missile
defense systems your own bartender all
kinds of crazy shit in the new dlc we've
got a trainee now it's got a dinghy a
dinghy I mean SC I'm so poor and I know
that that is I'll show you later all
right
hopefully it's but yeah let's go on to
the next one it's it's about hackers
threatening all the poor little console
peasants out there it's a group called
phantom squad and they are threatening
to take down both PlayStation Network
and Xbox Live get this on Christmas Day
when little Timmy has just unwrapped his
brand new console and was ready to play
with all his friends and join the the
console how is he a dick but they have
to be a dick but they don't need to do
that it goes down by itself yeah like I
know don't you remember the hack it has
better uh-oh
all right this past year was was when it
was when the consoles launched right
yeah they launched its routine was that
2013 I've been out for two years
yeah yeah I don't have either of them at
least 13 really okay
yeah memory yeah but I remember so that
last year - like I'm Christmas everybody
gets new presents and new things and all
of the games never acquire some kind of
download or patch or whatever right so
yeah I remember reading a story last
year about like all the all the people
all the kids who got presents console
presents on you know new game or
whatever interests us presents got
console presents console peasant
presents Arab video very coming out
there because it is got this right but
yeah like oh then the network was just
down because there's people oh that's my
rap man yes and a urinary aid sorry fix
me soul patch because you got to
monetize yes go Brandi what's you've
avoided
sponsoring your shit so yeah I guess
from my point is the Phantom Squad I
feel like doesn't shit they shouldn't
even need to do anything because maybe
they're just trying to take credit for
hacking because they know it's gonna go
down yeah yeah yeah so yeah that's
that's genius that's thing looks like
the server airs like a new batteries not
included of kids on Christmas morning
you know it's like he's too good oh you
know D batteries who the hell has D
batteries on him all the stores are
closed now it's like oh shit dad
disturber with well son fucking I
remember like getting a Wii U for for my
wedding actually in August and I
remember like my wife and I setting it
up for the first time it took us like
two and a half hours to dev download all
the updates not just for the console but
for the game that we had to and then
finally get to play the freaking game
only to realize the controller we had
didn't work but you know that's there's
a lot of uh there's like an entry to
barrier or barrier entry there's a
barrier yeah they're in a tunnel I do
have a love a bear I don't know weird
you're not strong tonight but yeah you
know what I mean yeah you know the other
thing that I think is is funny with this
stuff is like like GTA right we were all
planning to stream that when it came out
and we all pre-loaded and then ii go to
launch it like 15 gig up daily you guys
have like two years to do this port we
pre-loaded this stuff how did you do
like 15 gigs worth of iraq in the past
week and a half like what the hell but
just making extra downloadable contact
my day way to go to the store and pick
up our dlc in patches uphill both ways
on the flipside to - to - like i'm words
my phone's ringing
- it wasn't adam was that josh is just
happy to see it's not a magical
butterfly what i was trying to say is
that I would I would like to praise
rockstar and GTA for continuing to
release content updates for the game
which launched why - I don't know that
or do you just get yeah however we were
talking about that earlier though it's
like our two little bitch asses like
oh yeah you know and then we're like how
much our shark cards again I know I'm
going over to the dark side but I don't
have ten million in game that I can buy
say gosh that it but but you still make
it an option sure you can spend money in
the game but it's your choice and I will
say that the games in the past that
played the best example I can come up
with is probably plants vs. zombies and
Steve I still show Steve my plants vs.
zombies game every now and then I have
it on my phone I play it only when I
like fly so every once in a while I'm
like oh I'm gonna continue my plants
translation when you're in the but I
have spent zero dollars on the game and
whenever the bedroom I spend zero
dollars in the game and I've beaten like
five or six is oh I don't know I'm very
very far advanced in the game he's
always like how do you do that I spent
money and I was like I grinded ahead
just kept playing yeah alright sorry
yeah but yeah it's not pay to win and
stuff but yeah like like Josh was saying
it's it's almost like more a more evil
genius move on Rockstar to the drug
dealer to plate in front of you taste
execs and then you see all your friends
on their yachts but but how important is
context in something like that it's like
here you pay money and then you get this
or here we're gonna make this available
to you and you make up your own mind
whether well I think that's that's where
it's a better you know when he's term
scheme the plan right because you kind
of try before you buy like you know if
you get money somehow if you sell your
beard to Locks of Love and like I come
over and play around in your yeah like
this is awesome I want one now it's like
you know it exposes it to a much larger
audience that was just like yeah you get
a yacht and you get an armored limo if
you pay $25 for DLC right yeah so I
agree with I like it it's just damn it's
effective just piss off Paul I was gonna
try to pre-order the DLC and pay twice
market price for it and then ask them to
add microtransaction to Corona somehow
sabotage the entire Rockstar company and
force them to be crappy genius alright
so that's so there's that moving on to
my last story for tonight it's about
Edward Snowden he there was a document
that was discovered from a very
reputable source that claims that the
NSA is using your motherboard to spy on
you
oh it definitely is spying on you as W
CCF tech so boldly States how is this
possible how does this how does this
work well according to the document a
vulnerability in your bios can actually
allow it to be infected through its
bootloader
now there's probably a lot more to that
than what I just said but it doesn't
really go into too much detail of them
that you really can't tell that you've
been infected unless you have an
expensive electron microscope so maybe
that like that you get attached to your
phone case that we were thinking about
so that's all right totally fund that
shit so unless you have super you know
access to this crazy technology you
won't know that you're infected God
surge is the name of this newest malware
that lets security person that will
essentially monitor your activity when
you're online actively but it can also
track and log all the shit that you were
doing while you were offline once you go
back online so this is kind of scary I
guess I don't know if it's Snowden just
being paranoid not that he's ever
paranoid about anything but it is also a
concern and yeah and the vulnerability
can actually be removed because it's
embedded into your bias once it's there
according to the doc cannot be removed
unless you just straight up remove your
motherboard and swap it out for a new
one
so so yeah what let us know if god surge
pops up on your web browser or something
it's like most BIOS is a little crash
for Bo that's the fact of it the effect
is that when you start to browse the
Internet it'll pop up says you have god
Serge that's how it works that's how it
works Delta VG to consider it malware so
this is some this article and I didn't
read the whole thing I've glanced over
it cuz I don't have much time but it
seems it seems like they're talking
about they're using different
terminology here that's confusing to me
like they're saying it's in your BIOS
but then they're calling it malware like
yeah that's but malware to me is
something that resides like that
software and the software level of
operating system right
so I don't know you need an electron
microscope you can't look at how would I
know with an electron that what's the
other thing
how does that work well I mean
everything about this honestly reeks of
like it's sensational isn't like okay so
you go on and it's like Snowden doc
reveals is definitely spying on you can
we go down to the next thing it's like
NSA can spy on you through your
motherboards files now roll down to the
last paragraph it could all be a ruse at
the end of the day but bla bla right
yeah but the few big bold headlines you
had and the other 80% of the articles
we're screwed
I feel so suckered into writing about
this article well dammit I will not and
will not deny that I have had some
concern and I think it is a legitimate
concern that building hardware backdoors
into the consumer electronics stuff that
we use whether it's buying a computer
prebuilt buying a laptop buying parts to
build a computer that is something that
I think may probably exist and and is
something that sucks and we should be
aware of it if possible and avoid if
possible this specific report does not
have enough substantiating evidence that
there's no reason there ever yes it's
kind of like this could be a thing on
that thing in your computer that does
stuff right yeah okay
Alton all the good stories this week as
you can see got all the good stuff there
texted me to say he was gonna do that
why waste a month Kyle but worth it so I
Josh decided all of his best jokes and
good material for my half of the show
I'm spent
aren't you aren't you guys but that's
pretty much it for my half of the show
guys is your auntie Kylie yes I am Emily
you have like 12 minutes we got to fill
12 minutes okay I don't think anyone can
stand another half another 12 minutes of
JibJab lose just sit here awkwardly in
just stare bags you want to we can read
women's stories random stories and
some questions of people yeah we
actually look at the chassis what are we
doing
part one QA for this half of the show
which we is unprecedented we've never
done this but I also haven't checked I'm
already making you questions in chat let
us know and also feel free to ask Josh
whatever all of his deepest darkest
secrets about fractal design I'm sure he
can share all of it with you and none of
it is let me go and do the precursor I'm
not available to speak about products
that may or may not be in development
blah blah blah yeah so when's the next
global block coming out is have some
more whiskey then whatever this may be
yeah who knows he'll never tell so we
knew he need more drinks out here as a
drink right now Kyle tell us who won the
graphics card I can't hey I look like a
dippy Oh Diplo a Diplo I am a dad whoa
here's a good question from comrade
bunny X is that which sounds like a sexy
Russian there's a fetish site for
yourself is there planned awesome
Hardware next week and actually yes Kyle
and I already discussed this and we plan
to continue awesome Hardware through the
holidays forever and even through CES
week yep that's our plan that's right
now we're we're not I don't want to say
absolutely for sure we might still wear
matching sweaters and antlers reindeer
antlers so we will be broadcasting next
week same that time same bat-channel
because that is the 22nd we will be
broadcasting the week after that which
is the 29th and this is only because
these are removed by a few days from
Christmas and New Year's on either side
and even on the 5th which is Tuesday
January 5th of 2016 we will be in Las
Vegas yes but we're planning to do a Las
Vegas awesome part where stream from Las
Vegas the dear God why are we back in
yes yes in Vegas here's a question from
YouTube chat by pup shepherd who also
donated $1
nice which thank you which is which made
it stand out to me more I'm not gonna
lie
Josh do you do you do radio for that
voice it's so amazing uh
no I've done some voiceovers for
our product videos but that's about it
actually if you guys have ever seen the
King's Speech fabulous movie he boy stop
running every character in that movie
but there's but there's a procedure that
the guy who does of the radio for The
King's Speech that he goes through
before he talks you in the radio just
like a little puppet thing and he does
these vocal exercise Josh went through
all of that just before we started the
show just to make it look cash like I
know this is my normal voice I just this
is Rob thank God TED talk is over it's
like hey I got ready for the pep talk
you like it there it's like buttery
molasses that was double jab 5/5 fans
next hands are good have fans fans work
honestly it just it's one of those
things there's no like one best set up
it kind of depends on what type of
hardware you have you know what setup
you're going for it I get questions a
lot like is the define s a good case for
airflow it's like or air-cooled build
it's like well yeah cuz honestly to be a
good liquid cooling case you got to have
airflow so same sort of thing with
define s it just might be more suited
towards that so they are five it
basically kind of comes down to you know
positive or negative pressure I guess
what are you going for there some people
sacrifice a bit of airflow to have more
of a positive pressure setup so they
don't have the dust because it does also
induces you know I guess heat problems
there it's basically a blanket I mean
I've seen people like that they fuss
over there they're fans and then they
don't dust their system out for three
months yeah you dust your system out
it's like oh crap but just drop eight
degrees Lee it's a it's amazing how much
that can affect you especially if you
keep your system on the floor which I
always recommend against don't do a
quick aside here this is from James
Parker who sent over on Twitter thank
you James Parker for sending this he
says you sure can this is referring to
the electron microscope thing in the
Snowden article we were talking about
says electron microscopes can monitor
binary data at the seeing what is
running on the best oh I have no reason
to think that that's not true so James I
hope that is true and their ruse goes
deeper
Thunder pads yeah that's pretty
nurseries you know yeah cool hey all you
do the readings is you go to words
yep Niccolo what's up saying how sweden
girl says should i go for a gtx 970 or a
960 SSC I would say the 970 assuming
price is comparable
yeah yeah definitely jerky son says when
you and Kyle
I guess referring to you Josh made that
no 202 commercial how many times did you
crack up when he was just chilling on
your couch and had that sexy voice
needing those stale chips with that
basic Netflix Cable basic basic there's
a lot of details yeah well I I was kind
of I guess you know I was filming at the
time and I was kind of directing Josh he
was doing a great job too but I think
that was like they were in a fucking
epic we were doing an it fucking epic
job and as I think this towards the end
of the day we were kind of tired and we
were a few just like for some fucking
Korean barbecue at that point I was like
come on just get through the lines damn
it
like at first when we did that lets me
see me start getting more like oh really
cuz we thought we fuck we film the
Porsche yeah no no - OH - right before
that and that was like a few hours deep
and we were having a really good time
with that like yeah Heather can my wife
can vouch for that but we were very
efficient with that commercial I'm happy
with how it turned out which another
question would be how many times did we
throw Heather out of the car and
honestly three or four and like if you
look her knees bloody that was probably
her best like she I left how do they
call you fell out really good but the
problem was a sacrifice she didn't move
far enough away from the car where could
take off now fear of running her leg
over I saw you consider like no we're
going to run it again I run it again
so no that was good she was a trooper on
though yeah she was we need to give a
huge shout out to reviews by Gary right
now Kyle you need to give a huge shout
out to review since this is on your
youtube channel right now Gary what did
you do he just dropped $25
into the donation pot thank you so much
Gary you said enjoy enjoy a pizza on me
way to go girl oh yeah there's little
Gary I hope I get some thanks man I
appreciate that lying bastards I'll be
buying it early
it's all good
all right question for Josh from Andhra
this seems legit if you have time how
are the acoustic differences between the
Defiant r5 with and without the side
panel window you want to know go to our
website we have like the define r5 we
tested in the world's quietest room I
did that with Austin Evans and it's not
so much in the video but if you go to
that landing page that it has there is a
link to the actual ISO testing that we
had to do which is government regulated
testing I mainly did that so it wasn't
like oh you guys nerf the test in your
favor like we had to follow an obscene
amount of parameters and they'll show
you right in there we tested solid panel
versus window panel the reality is
there's no much difference at all less
than one decimal difference it depends
on the test in certain tests the window
was actually quieted now there's a
couple things there first of all I hear
a lot of people call bullshit on that
the difference is a like you know
acrylic plexi stuff like that resonates
and a different frequency than metal
does so where you may get some more of
your harmonic vibrations and sound
signatures from a metal panel you don't
have that same effect going with like an
acrylic panel or window panel the other
thing is we've worked quite a bit in the
past on our window design just a bit and
man this is furry so like we've spent a
lot of time working our window design
it's also about how you mount the window
to the panel things like that that we've
done and then something like why would
you even go with the solid panel then
well the solid panel still has the fan
vent on the side so if you want direct
air over your you know your GPU or
something like that also surprisingly
enough like we'll get tech support calls
like hey I bought a window panel version
I'd really just rather have like a solid
panel they want to buy just the solid
panels so you know teach their own
there's some people don't want to look
at the interior system maybe those are
true it didn't do cable management but
hope that answer your question but
literally all the details aren't I mean
it's like each one of those reports is
something like a
nine pages of like graphs and
explanations and all that sort of stuff
so I did it legit I spent a long time
researching I had to read 182 page
manual and just one of the tests to make
sure that I understood how they wanted
things to run so geez check that out
hopefully that's a good tool to you and
shows us understand what a bunch of
marketing bullshit okay nice by the way
huge shout out to when a co works as
well for donating $5 have some beer with
that Pizza he says nice Thank You Man I
really appreciate that we all do we or
with falls 40:20 attitude half of a beer
well yeah what's up with that Paul high
maintenance after well because I drank
the rest of it I'm talking about the
cost of the beer the cost
