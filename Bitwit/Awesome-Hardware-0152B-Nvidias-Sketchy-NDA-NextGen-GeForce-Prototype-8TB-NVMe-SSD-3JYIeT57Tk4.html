control just see it to see it first yeah
that way we can actually say hello right
when when we go live yeah instead of
professional every show you're starting
with us like picking our nose or
something anyway it looks like we're
live now to both twitch and YouTube more
or less so hello and welcome to awesome
hardware this is episode 152 side B if
you missed side a go ahead and click the
link in my video description here on
YouTube or just stay where you are on
Twitch you could probably watch a
rebroadcast after the fact no you have
to watch Saturday first otherwise your
do you want a direct continuity nothing
will make sense right all the jokes that
we make like they're all callbacks to my
half of the show it's true it's very
intricate the way it's designed we we
look we look younger
inside a because it technically happened
first and you'll be able to tell that
you know or five o'clock shatters has
grown and more and it'll throw you off
but we have beer a word of warning we
drink beer on this show we occasionally
use adult language so if you're not okay
with that then maybe don't watch or at
least keep small children out of the way
because we don't want to offend anyone
but we also want to speak freely speak
our minds yeah shows made for adults
juries uh this is Hubbard Hubbard's Cave
IPA this is a fan gave us to us a IPA is
there two eyes there IIPs one hop
Imperial IPA perhaps la PA this is 8.5
percent alcohol by volume we're gonna
we're gonna split this okay yeah yeah
feel free to take as much as you want
cuz uh just a word before warning I am
still pretty jet-lagged from from from
Japan and Taiwan I've been up since
about 3:00 a.m. this morning so sorry if
my half is a little bit slow or you know
mainly me if I'm a little bit slower
than usual
this was sent by a fan especially with
beer we got a collection of these nice
beers from a fan but I didn't bring the
the note that was sent so you're not
pouring very welds at all today no
burn Matt's not the best poor it's
reasonable I have as much foam as you
have beer I know it's like converted
Cheers
welcome to SEC the second half of
episode 152 lost some hardware doesn't
look that bad if I if I tilt it that's
good it's whoa it's kind of like a hazy
IPA it's hazy you can see little little
bits of yeast floating around and stuff
so prior to now we've been drinking
Presidente which is a pilsner from the
dominican republic which is which is
which is pretty decent pretty good you
know that blow me away there's so much
more complexity to this though I'm yeah
that's why I'm just I'm like there's
layers trying to figure it all out
snozzberries taste like snozzberries
trying be a first under undercurrent of
snozzberries oh yeah just it's actually
very good it's you it's right on the eye
I really do hope the wifey sauce is
coming back because I just remembered
that she drove us here so she's gone I
either have to she wouldn't just go you
take an uber or lyft home shouldn't just
leave you here would she I hope not that
happened before I'm like thinking like
did I say something earlier that made
her mad and she left me forever I don't
know but yeah I have no way of getting
home unless she comes back so it's great
that I'm drinking lots of beer right now
okay so Paul already sort of mentioned
that we occasionally will swear and that
we drink beer and stuff like that we
also have stores where you can buy
merchandise from yeah
these are personal items or you know not
personal yeah torn by Kyle yeah what I
meant to say is that these are
personally designed by by all of us by
by mean Paul and our teams of designers
and friends I'm totally on a good one I
try to keep to that personal word I
really am I really am these they're
personally designed for you because I
feel like our lovely viewers at home I
feel like these these designs represent
you can
we are you can personally accept
delivery of the package once you order
personally sign away from our stores it
will be personally shipped to you as
well by our personable merchandise guy
but my store is bit with tech slash
store you can buy all of these things
all of these things there's shirts and
stuff and then Paul store
Paul's on right now it has things at
Paul's hardware net if you buy something
from either store you'll get a Johnson
shoutout you'll get a double Johnson at
the end of the show if you happen to
pick up something from both of our
stores there's also lots of awesome
hardware merch yeah
very awesome awesome hardware rich if I
do say so myself look here on or here on
this one yep and me about to kill myself
for the bottle so yeah go ahead and buy
all that shit it helps us a lot but
let's move on to our first segment of
this half of the show which is news
general tech news maher news this is
talking you this first article is
talking about the sketchy Nvidia MBA or
is it really that sketchy we're gonna
explore it a little bit today this
article was initially from videocards
calm well initially it was from high CDE
oh yes video cards was talking about the
heist de refusal to sign the NDA after
claiming that it by nature attacks
journalistic values and their reasoning
for that was a it was kind of shifty to
begin with that there was no product
mentioned there was no mention of what
product would be talked about which I
guess kind of makes sense because if
it's an NDA you don't want to reveal
what product you're gonna talk about
before they've actually signed it right
also a blanket NDA it's a blanket NDA so
then there's also like let's say
basically Nvidia staying in this NDA
that any confidential information that's
provided to the party must be used
solely for the benefit of Nvidia which
kind of sounds like they're saying that
you can't say anything negative about
the products that this NDA pertains to
which would definitely go against you
know classic journalism being able to
express your own opinion on such things
but and then there's also the imposition
of a five-year expiration on
confidential information so potentially
you
if you sign this document does that mean
you can't say anything negative about
these products for five years you're
tongue-tied essentially so there's all
these questions and all the NDA also
mentions specific trade secrets from
Nvidia that can never be talked about
what qualifies as a trade secret sure if
YouTube is going oh yea there's no
mermen okay sorry
okay continue alright and it also
prevents journalist from posting
hypothesis or predictions based on
confidential information so you wouldn't
theoretically be able to post any sort
of like rumor articles that even even if
they were those rumors were sourced from
third parties for example and I guess we
should quickly point out that these
these are these like red flags
according to the article that were
throwing up about this NDA as far as
like my things they're saying like how
dare they ask people to agree to these
terms yeah exactly but but gamers Nexus
which is what I was getting to actually
released a video today where they
actually hopped on a phone call with a
real lawyer and asked him about the
details in this NDA and it turns out
that according to the lawyer it's not
quite as I don't know deceiving as as
people have initially thought where it
seems pretty standard most of the things
that they touch on even though they
sound kind of fishy are probably not and
it's it's still it'll still be
interesting to see which tech reviewers
decide to sign this NDA and which ones
don't and the reasons for doing either
or I personally don't have a huge issue
with it especially after hearing that
that phone call conversation I can't
regurgitate everything that was said but
go ahead and check it out on gamers
Nexus this YouTube channel because
there's a lot of good details there but
I don't know I feel like I feel like
this is something to make headlines but
not necessarily a real issue so just in
the interest of full disclosure I have
not signed this NDA personally yet but
it has nothing to do with
any like theoretical shadiness or like
egregious terms that I found in it was
purely because I was distracted and
hadn't gotten it
gotten to it yet yeah I've just been
busy I read this over again after people
started sort of calling foul about it
and I really didn't find anything that
stood out to me as like again over the
line as far as what they're asking of
people I think it's just a matter of
legalese being legalese it can often be
written in a specific way to in order to
provide again this is a blanket NDA it's
made to be something that you sign once
it's not something that you sign every
single time in video Lots it launches a
new product or anything like that and
there are some terms in here that do
provide them a little bit more
protection for leaks of confidential
information which they deal with all the
time and my personal opinion is that if
you are privy to this NDA and privy to
information from Nvidia prior to launch
and near journalists and you're doing
your views or you're trying to provide
feedback on a product someone who does
break NDA and share confidential
information or even goes so far as to
talking about the NDA itself as gamers
Nexus mentioned in their via video if
you've signed this NDA
the only reason you're able to talk
about it right now is because it was
published by this website and it is now
part of the public domain right so I
don't see anything horribly wrong about
this there was one line in here that
kind of made me hesitate and it was
about like something of along lines of
nothing or everything shall be done to
benefit in video summary solely to the
benefit of Nvidia but again most of my
questions about this I think were dealt
with to some degree in the bits of the
gamers Nexus video that we were able to
watch just before this and oh your video
on YouTube is unlisted perhaps I
switched it over to public just a moment
ago
and maybe double check that but try
refreshing it guys it says it's public
right now yeah it's public an app so I
hit refresh guys but yeah confidential
information is confidential information
until it becomes public once it is
public it is no longer confidential
information so the seems pretty other
the referrals in this document to
confidential information and like a five
year like like the the five year time
limit on that this is all stuff that
like if NVIDIA tells you something key
to the inner workings of their business
and then you go and share that like
that's that's bad and they need to have
some sort of legal recourse against that
and that's what this is really all about
right so anyway for anyone who's really
freaking out about this or feels like
Nvidia is trying to pull something over
that doesn't seem to be the that wasn't
my initial impression reading this on my
own
elsewise and it was further reinforced
again by the gamers Nexus video which
they were Steve he's he's he's smart he
wouldn't just talk to a lawyer about it
yeah good job so and something is
legally binding as an NDA that's
probably the best person to talk to you
really so glad we cleared that up to
some degree and I think I'll probably
I'll probably sign the NDA soon because
I kind of want to know what it's about
well it's our job what NDA cow Oh what
NDA sure I don't know why would we even
mention that okay that's right
moving on though also story about Nvidia
and their next-gen PCB proto wait we're
not allowed to talk about this because
of the NDA but do we no I'm just kidding
you almost got me there
well the NDA does it is specific about
like if we knew something mm-hmm then we
couldn't discuss that something but I
feel like an even in the past prior to
the to whatever language is in that in
the new version of it in the past even
if we have discussed something that's a
rumor about something that we did know
additional information about I think
like this is published on a website so
we can say that here's this what's
published on the website if we'd say
and we actually know that's true right
yeah then adding information to the
public domain which sure we can talk a
little bit more directly to Nvidia about
that though to be sure but for the time
being not to mention we haven't signed
any NDA's yet oh yeah but it's done I
meant what what up what up asan I
actually met him at Computex this year
nice yes he wrote the article BCC of
tech and this is technically a leak
initially from reddit it seems to be a
test board that Nvidia is using to test
upcoming GPUs which were assuming is
gonna be a Geforce gaming card targeted
at you know a consumer market but we
don't know but we don't know for sure it
could be is all speculation could be
like a turing card could be the size of
the there's no GPU area you just the
dimensions there kind of reflect what
you typically see on a g-force card it's
a larger chip there is 12 gigs of GTD or
six memory which we can actually see
from the memory chips that are
surrounding the word that where the die
would go it's we're talking about a
384-bit memory interface a memory bus
interface with three eight pin
connectors for power although that
doesn't necessarily mean that whatever
reference card this is going to be
eventually is gonna have triple power
connectors this could just be for for
testing the full potential or power
limits of the card and then you know we
it's doesn't necessarily know it's
espect that they would over build a test
board in order to provide the chip with
as much power as it could possibly want
yeah they're testing the various limits
and voltage voltage delivery and stuff
but then there's also a second gen
brought to the consumer front yet as the
Titan V currently has two of these
connectors on board but you can't
actually get to use these cards through
envy links so again like Paul said the
this board might just be over engineered
because it's a testing board so there's
really little that we have to go off
here there's a single mini displayport
just for testing WCF tech estimates 672
gigabytes a second bandwidth which is
far more than any consumer grade geforce
card at the moment there are four blower
fans that are spotted at the top of the
V RMS for n power delivery so one could
expect higher quality higher quality
power system on the reference cards and
yeah I mean I guess the best-case
scenario is that this means a potential
gtx 1180 is is around the corner
hopefully sooner than later but we'll
have more details for you guys as they
come to light if you're looking at it
from like the pure like I'm excited
about next-gen stuff you could easily
look at this and speculate on that but
it can just as easily be a test board
for something like Turing or something
on the enterprise level that really
doesn't have much application towards
the consumer space right but who knows I
think the most significant thing about
this is just that the the gd-r gd-r 6
that they're working with and that it's
12 gigabyte configuration yeah and the
memory bus interface is also something
to at least acknowledge 384-bit isn't
radically different than what we've seen
in the past but I think we just a solid
memory configuration like if this is the
next-gen gtx 1070 that'd be super sweet
probably not that's a lot of memory for
1070 successor for sure current 1070 has
8 gigs the high end 1080 TI has 11 so
jumping up to the next step you know
making making a nice flagship waking the
highest ends Kennedy making the super
high ends the high end has been
definitely done in the past
so yeah I wouldn't be surprised to see a
12 gig buffer on next-gen next-gen GPUs
I mean heck they've had enough time to
work on it that's true it's been what
two years now since the GTX 1080
launched yeah alright moving on though
this is an article from prag de I
believe it's a German website so I don't
know if you have the option to translate
it there oh yeah yes we've done Google
Translate cool wolf in sheep's clothing
and a 4k panel it works in the cue HD
monitor so basically this article is
talking about the the the 1440p monitor
that you have a quad HD monitor that you
have might actually be using a 4k panel
as they've learned as this this
journalist has learned from panel
producers and manufacturers the cost of
producing a 27 inch 4k uhd panel is now
at least as expensive or even cheaper
than a quad HD panel perhaps because I
don't know there's there's a Jeff I
don't know I don't know if the man is
really it but maybe that there's so many
4k panels being produced that they've
just gone down in price or something and
quad HD still isn't quite as popular I
guess would be that fabs saw 4k is a
more viable up upgrade from 1080 and
more mainstream than 1440 so they
invested more and manufacturing
technology for that yeah but a lot of
gamers still kind of keep an eye out for
like a solid mid-range well priced 1440
monitor because you can actually game on
it without having to have a crazy GPU
configuration right and you get a high
refresh rate yeah and you can often get
a high refresh rate with that than with
4k sure and and so what the article is
stating is that in the event of certain
supply shortages where quad HD panels
are hard to come by
that 4k panels may be used so
essentially they're just down scaling
that resolution to quad HD which at
first at first glance might not seem
like a huge deal but but this could pose
some issues because there are a couple
ways that you could tell
if the if the quad HD monitor you were
sold is actually using a 4k panel
for instance the listed resolution and
pixel size should match up for example a
3840 by 2160 panel should have a pixel
size of 0.16 millimeters and a quad HD
panel should have a size a pixel size of
0.23 millimeters so if you see on the
spec sheet that you have a 2560 by 1440
panel but the pixel size is 0.16
millimeters that could indicate that
there was some interpolation going on
which is kind of interesting but that I
mean pixel size isn't really super
common I think on a lot of spec sheets
for panels these days the other way that
you could tell potentially is just
visually by looking at the panel
especially when you're viewing certain
test patterns there's an example on the
website or even small text could
potentially look blurry if a 4k panels
being used because of the down scaling
this blurriness could take place because
of again the interpolation that's that's
going on in the down scaling process so
and this may also limit you know your
maximum refresh rate being a 4k panel
according to the article there's no way
as of now that you could actually flash
the firmware to allow for native 4k
resolution so don't that's my question
right don't go out and buy you know a
bunch of 1440p panels and hope that you
can flash them to 4k that seems to not
be the case as of now but it's something
to be aware of and use the pencil trick
use the pencil trick yes it's highly
effective we're unsure how many models
are being handled or changed in the
market right now or being affected by
this trend we don't even know how how
widespread this trend is so we'll keep
it we'll keep a close eye on this as
well hopefully pred et has some updates
in the future
moving on Michigan researchers are
claiming that they've created the
tiniest computer in the world this is an
article from hexxus and the computer is
called the m3 which is a point three
millimeter cube computer developed by
University of Michigan what you see
there is the computer on the right and a
grain of rice
oh that's rice yes so so it looks
absolutely gargantuan I thought it was
like a sperm I don't know maybe icing I
see they put the the mini computer on a
cake
that's impressive how do you solder
these wires that's you've got to have a
machine do that I'm pretty sure we're
probably that is that is super duper
tiny like almost microscopic I mean not
microscopic so cute it's so tiny and I
guess people are still debating on
whether or not this can be called a
computer because it has very minimum
functionality for example it lacks the
ability ability to hold data once it's
powered down so it only has volatile
memory it doesn't have like actual hard
storage or anything like that and that's
actually because University of Michigan
removed the fixed storage capacity just
to reduce the size even further
that's cheating that was a compromise
that they made and you know and there
are certain applications where you don't
actually need non-volatile memory so you
know I'm curious to see I'd be curious
to know how much bigger the computer
would be if they if they added in hard
storage for example a tiny computer
running on a ram drive it's garbage
just just Ram do I need to make a new
form factor for this though yes yes
micro micro ITX mini micro nano nano ITX
man oh yeah that's a good one Noi TX
super nano micro nano micro micro nano I
don't know I TX micro micro nano I TX
mini that was a nice ring to it let's go
with that
rolls off the tongue they've also
switched exchange diodes for switched
capacitors for light tolerance so
apparently this non P non-volatile
memory by the way non-volatile
correction jet perhaps this is some this
is a light powered PC apparently it's
got
key components including a processor Ram
photo voltaics I'm not sure maybe that's
the nodes the are the light capacitors
that I mentioned and also has some
wireless how the whole takes would be
like animal packs like a solar panel Oh
a solar panel okay yeah that makes sense
and then also wireless transmitters and
receivers certain applications at the m3
has been used for so far include oil
reservoir mount monitoring biochemical
process monitoring surveillance which is
kind of creepy
tiny snail studies sounds cute and
cancer studies this is probably the most
worthy application thanks to its highly
accurate temperature monitoring ability
I think it can actually monitor temps to
a like an error of like point one
degrees Celsius which is really accurate
it can be used to monitor temperatures
inside of tumors and that can better
help doctors decide how to evaluate
cancer therapies and things like that so
this thing's actually been put to use
and and this is changed in the game in
certain fields so that's kind of cool
but let's talk about something that's
maybe a little bit more relevant and
usable for for us techies including the
Samsung SSD this the Samsung crazy SSS
deeds it's enterprise so you know you
probably won't see it in many gaming
builds or anything but they've crammed
they've managed to cram 8 terabytes on
to the next gen pcie 3.0 by 4 nvme SSD
your your new read we're going to
already yeah I'm glad I'm glad they give
us the option for old reddit old read it
it's nice of them this articles from
Tom's Hardware
and this SSD is absolutely insane it's
not much bigger than your typical m2
drive it's 110 millimeters by thirty
point five millimeters just eight point
five millimeters wider than m2 it's
actually part of the nf1 form factor not
m dot two but it's focused on enterprise
users and same interface
yes it looks like it's still got that
like M key or you know
beaky or whatever but you can definitely
tell that it's it's quite a bit wider so
I'd be curious to see if if you could
actually stick this in like a see 370
motherboard oh thanks Tom's Hardware for
once again posting it completely
irrelevant video to the thing I'm trying
to watch what the heck no they do this
all the time it irritates the crap out
of me no they just embed videos that are
completely audited related to the thing
we're talking about in there it's like
you're gonna get more views on them or
something I don't know I don't know
really bad it's annoying really bad
strategy okay oh yeah that's that's what
we're talking about so you can also tell
that you know or one of the benefits of
just having a bigger PCB a wider form
factor is to cram all those nand chips
on there looks like they've got eight of
them or so maybe security tag yeah yeah
so sixteen and these are 512 so that
means they're 512 gig man packages DRM
cash on this foga which is insane
soldered to the PCB each package has 16
layers of 256 gigabit three bit v-nand
chips so we're using vertical nand here
stack in that and it's gonna use a brand
new high-performance controller that we
don't know exactly what model it's gonna
be yet but it is gonna support nvme 1.3
as the protocol and pcie 3.0 bytes for
connection i would assume that it's
gonna be a phoenix controller as we've
seen with past nf1 prototypes from
samsung it's gonna allegedly hit 30 100
megabytes per second sequential reads
and 2 thousand megabytes per second
sequential writes very fast really good
for datacenter use offers for Killip
kilobyte random read performance up to
500 thousand i ops in four kilobyte
write per write performance up to 50,000
ions it's also going to have 12 gigs of
lpddr4 memory to accelerate the data
processing and improve energy efficiency
and this will all be backed by a
three-year warranty
no mention of price because it'll
probably make us cry but there you go I
think one of their one of Samsung's
partners already already was boasting
about putting like 72 of these in
and like a raid or something and having
like half a petabyte of bean and flash
it's cool I wonder if they need some
sort of new hardware though I mean just
cuz the wider size I mean I'm sure
there's tons of other boards with MDOT
to inter interfaces that these would the
plug would physically be compatible with
but right but wouldn't actually fit in
the slot on the motherboard because I
don't know what what nvme protocol is
being used right now for like mainstream
boards nvme what do you mean like this
one says that it supports the nvme 1.3
protocol yeah didn't know they were
versioning that I hadn't seen hadn't
seen those yet I imagine it would be
faster transfer speeds and yeah so maybe
maybe that means Oh PCIe wooden three
3.0 by four it's not PCIe general board
no no yeah that was a correction in the
article but I guess time will tell if if
this is actually a viable viable
component to put into a gaming PC or
something like that that'd be
interesting that because they'll be
chemical to test out it'll either work
maybe at a slower speed that's you know
reduced because you know the protocols
slower on that board in particular or it
just won't work at all
Donald from chat says vertical mount I
think that's true actually like I have
some Asus boards that have a vertical
MDOT to mount I like the dim to wear
maybe on the dim dot to I mean it's
really just a matter of like widths well
I don't know if there's anything beyond
just the physical physical form factor
preventing you from plugging this into
an existing MDOT to slot yeah that would
be a big question but if if if that's
the only limiting factor then yeah I
mean some of those vertical ones have an
array space width wise to support
something like that oh yeah I know what
you're mad there might be like the
sticks just standing straight up
okay yeah so we'll have to see if the
what's the the nf1 the most about to see
if nf1 includes any requirements on like
the software side other than just the
physical form factor difference yeah and
the slut will also have to take whatever
key that is oh it'll take it take it
it'll like it enjoy it every minute all
right before this gets out of hand let's
move on to our final article for tech
news which is about ek ek expanding
their liquid cooling kits with their ek
kit RGB 240 and ek kit RGB 360 this is
an article once again from WCC F Tech
and these kits will will include
everything you need for a custom loop if
you want to call your CPU so no GPU
looks like no GPU is here but if you
want to do a nice little loop on your
processor you've got everything here
from the waterblock which is an ek
supremacy Evo RGB you also get either
the 240 or the 360 cool stream PE
radiator so those are 40 millimeters
thick which kind of gives a nice balance
between thickness and performance I've
used the PE radiators before they're
super high quality very reliable they do
a good job and then there's the X rays
140 Revo d5 RGB PWM pump rez combo which
obviously everything here has RGB it
seems pump 4s combos are really nice
they're easy no fuss kind of easy to
mount in your in your case the
integrated solution definitely frees up
a lot of space and it looks like a
shorter reservoir but it's a d5
it's a d5 this is a really high quality
pump I think it's their flagship pump
actually from ek that is gonna be B even
good if you wanted to expand this loop
in the future it's gonna have enough
power to it to keep the flow rate up and
saturate the whole loop and then you've
got the ek Vardar Evo 120 er RGB fans
which feature things like things that
you would expect from from radiator fans
like high static pressure
and obviously RGB soft tubing this is
going to be a soft tubing kit obviously
they're not expecting you to bend your
own tubes here so it is gonna include a
number of ACF fittings and cryo fuel
clear fluid from ek as well with all the
mounting accessories you might need
pricing for the 240 model starts at 399
euro and the 360 model is gonna go for
439 euro so that seems to be what like
350 and and 400 us I'm not exactly sure
on the conversion right now yeah but
it'll be slightly less for for the
United States prices
I guess that's I guess that's I don't
know if you're saving a ton of cash as
opposed to like buying all the parts all
the cart just a little bit I think
you're probably saving a bit from the
bundle but you got to be you got to be
serious about your about your cooling
you got to really want it to spend that
much on just just cooling the kits are
nice for people who have never done
water cooling before because it's got
like kind of all the all the all the
basics that you would need to put it all
together and you can kind of have that
that assurance that you're gonna be able
to set up your water cooling loop for
your CPU yeah so like if you took this
like the 360 and you added a water block
like a GPU block it's gonna be a hundred
two hundred and twenty probably plus a
few other fittings and whatever so say
another two hundred euro then you can
get a full water cooling loop for you
know 650 to 700 again that's euros so
hard to say how much that will be u.s.
dollars right so barter cooling is
expensive but you can't makes good
products so yeah for those who want that
type of boom here's another option for
you and especially for anyone who's
interested in that but maybe hasn't done
it before just want something that they
has everything contained what's nice is
that you could easily expand this and
you can easily upgrade the tubing to
like hardline you'd have to buy new
fittings of course but it's it's a super
flexible solution unlike a lot of
standard arrows that are expandable but
there are a lot a lot more limitations
to those this is all copper right there
the aluminum line has a specific name
that isn't included here comes the
primacy those coppers yeah talk copper
too so that is nice good all right cool
moving on to our next segment we are
bringing back ask the audience where
Paul and I ask you guys a series of
questions three questions to be exact
and then Paul and I have to sort of
guess what your answers are to see how
well we know you and and I feel like
we've been we've been apart from you
guys for so long but I think it's good
to be reacquainted we've gone down
different paths perhaps we have but I
should mention that I don't have a lower
thirds here for some reason for I asked
the audience I'm not sure why so right
now the lower thirds awesomesauce news I
mean sure good Roback still got my face
it's actually my profile picture on
YouTube I think still so yes okay let's
let's dive into our first question what
are we asking the audience this week Val
all right this is very topical because
this is going on still basically we want
to know how many games have you guys
already purchased from the steam summer
sale we're gonna get an idea of just how
addictive you guys are to to buying
games and and if you really have a
problem or if you're more on the
moderate side and you know you're only
gonna buy the games that you're
seriously interested in playing whereas
I know some people including myself at
one time not anymore
we just buy games because they were
really cheap and got good reviews but
that never ended up playing them and
then you just end up with this giant
Steam library and you feel like shit
because you've only played the quarter
of the games that's Steve like Steve who
often has multiple copies of the same
game
so that he can like share it with his
wife and other people who come over for
lands and stuff well Steve has like an
extra Steam account for friends he does
that he keeps populated with with active
steam licenses if that's not indication
of the heart like a friend happens to
stop by and he's like hey you want to
play some video games
he's like log onto the Steam account and
we can play I have three of everything
you have no excuse and you will you will
play those games with Steve and he will
enjoy it
Steve just forces all of his friends to
play with him Steve Steve I don't miss
him as much as you do though cuz I just
last weekend haha so so the options are
Oh actually let's ask the next question
while we give you guys a chance to
answer the next question is how much RGB
is in your PC right now fairly personal
it is very very personal I'm trying to
you know push the boundaries of of live
of live talk shows so yeah obviously RGB
has been around for several years now
and it's a very polarizing topic some
people love it some people hate it and
some people just don't care so Paul and
I are gonna guess pretty soon here where
you guys lie but let's go ahead and
answer the first question Paul how many
how many games do you think on average
our average consumer buys or has bought
already for the steam summer sale okay
um I'm gonna vote for one to two okay
and what and just to make things
interesting what percentage do you think
that will comprise 32% 32% yes you think
about a third of our audience right now
has already bought one to two games
slightly slightly less than a third okay
also comprising the majority which means
that I will win and answer this question
correctly okay well that's the answer I
was gonna choose but since you already
chose it I'm gonna do three to five
games I'm gonna say three to five games
three to five so yeah and I'm gonna say
that 13% viewers have already bought
three to five games 13% with three to
five and somehow that's the winner
no I don't think you're doing your math
correctly no not that it's the winner
I'm not saying if you're but you just
chose it as the winner you just said
three to five is gonna be the winner
well I'm seeing which of us is more
accurate with our percentage well I
wasn't aware of that I don't know I
didn't know that just percentage
accuracy was okay all right fine most
key thing okay fine then all argue that
it's going to be the highest percentage
at thirty one percent okay that's that's
my long as you're over twenty five
percent that I think it can technically
work out yep
I'm price is reading it prices writing
it right now so did you say thirty five
percent thirty one thirty one percent
thirty one percent five sneaking ready
can in one yes right results go ahead
zero whoa
zero wins with 60% of the vote nobody
gives two Wow
shits about the steam summer sale but I
mean look at how OnPoint I was initially
with my initial answer of 13 percent
does that exactly that's exactly what I
I mean if we were playing it that way I
would have nailed it technically you won
based on the way we decided to that none
of us chose zero to angle it Wow
everyone's just so over the steam summer
everyone people have too many people
have too many steam games I think
already yeah they've already bashed
steam sales they've bought so many game
right that now people are buying games
at a faster rate than new games are
coming out new desirable games are
coming out and that's how we're gonna
read reach the gaming singularity is
when the number of games produced has
more mass
the number of people playing the games
than the games will play causing them to
collapse into a black hole I'm not sure
that's how it works but I hope it
doesn't work that way that sounds scary
but at that point I think all Steam
games would be free so oh that's it
works out for everyone I think all right
bring on the black hole pregame show
everyone okay let's let's talk about our
last question here the last question for
you guys is who should run the first
president who should run for president
of the United States next some of these
in here this is the fifth we've tried to
veer away from politically charged
questions well well we don't have to
argue why we think the thing we do the
choice is right but I'm more curious to
hear what the audience has to say of
course
we're asking the audience about their
opinion on this not us we're just we're
innocent we just get to guess what we
think the audience would pick this
doesn't reflect on us at all but before
so exactly
assuming for the sink of just just just
assessing this question that you've put
together here yes with zero input from
me by the way
why what's wrong with this so other than
presumably like I don't want to say this
so the most viable option here on this
list would have to be Donald Trump
simply because he is the current
president your options you're providing
us beyond that none of the other options
are a person besides a five-year-old and
Kanye West which are arguably not right
so well I guess this would be a good
question for again this is this is to
see how well we know our audience this
will say more about them than than any
rights or things on this list I can't
wait I can't wait to see what the answer
is because you know that that will
whatever is answered yeah most will
determine
the actual president liked it it will be
proof in the meantime though it's time
for us to make our choices for how much
our GB is in the fans pcs okay so none
or a lot you know what I think
I chose first on the first one so okay I
am I want to believe it's a lot but my
gut is saying it's just some because
there's still a lot of people who built
their systems before the RGB craze so
I'm going to say some but not a lot of
RGB there's at least maybe one to three
components in your bill that has already
be lighting whether you've configured it
to actually do the RGB like color
changing cycle or you've just set it as
one static color that still counts as
RGB in my opinion so I'm gonna say at
least some RGB has infiltrated most of
our viewers builds at this point based
on the first question I'm gonna go with
zero the zero answer cuz that definitely
one for the first time so none it's our
RGB is a devil and are we gauging
percentages here again we can just for
fun for this ace over 50% okay and I'm
gonna say 38 38 percent for some 38
percent have some which leaves like oh
wait 10 percent or less that for lots of
RGB I'm gonna say 40 to 42 instead
upping it to 42 all right I'm upping it
before you Cal's last second change has
given him the lead oh did ya got me
closer what did you what did you said
before that it was first it was like 30
38 and then I upped it to 42 Wow I'm
doing pretty well actually
RGB has has become so such a thing on
the market so quickly I feel like
right also this terrible super Sam thing
at the most ruffle all right so I lose I
mean none was second but definitely you
win there Tao Wow okay and then Allah
Allah quarter people have 25% copious
amounts the rigs are dripping an RGB see
and this is why I'll only four passed
the audience's because I've learned so
much about you guys
yes I know all of you personally now
based on what your rig looks like it's
just an extension of your own beautiful
faces alright let's get this over with
quickly alright who should run for
president of the United States next I
mean I guess I could I should also point
out like Donald Trump he's he started
off his his re-election campaign like a
week after he was elected so he's
already there he's doubling down already
for sure he's doubling down on himself
is that who should that's who is who is
yeah we got Kanye West of course any
five-year-old a magic 8-ball alright so
I guess I get to go first this time
what's the best choice here besides
Donald Trump what's the lesser of know
eight seven evils alright any
five-year-old as it may be Kyle's left
net and five-year-old and Google
assistance is but see it's it's
pre-programmed I can't coin tosses or
potato jeez I really left you with left
us with a lot of great options I feel
like you can't go wrong with most of
these I'm gonna choose your left nut
okay okay I was left nut because it's on
the left that's what I always leans
towards the left yeah your left nut but
I can't give her a percentage anyway
there's too many choices to make
variables that's true
so ah there we go
and I'm gonna say I'm gonna have to go
with potato Kyle's going with potato
potato just seems right so who will win
light nut or potato potatoes never let
me down in
life or ever potato has always been
there for me already yep love that there
you go
hell yeah nice hell yeah with a double
double try excited about Cal's left nut
in second place tied with potato stupid
potato tied the United States Presidents
that's a great day in America
baked potato potatoes vodka Russia
obviously this conspiracy
what's Mexico uh and now we do QA jobs
oh no I'm sorry Ted my pcs been my PC
this is a segment where you guys submit
photos of your crappy rigs and Paul and
I tell you how crappy they are good no
most of them are actually pretty pretty
decent rigs we just give you some
pointers and suggestions suggestions on
how to make them nicer so the first one
is from Gunther Gunther Dixon with the
core i5 4690k 16 gigs of Corsair ddr3
and a sous z97 a motherboard of Corsair
h-60 liquid cooler a GTX 960 inside of
an NZXT s340 case so looks like we've
got a black and blue theme going on here
custom custom sleeved cables which look
pretty nice yeah it's kind of
interesting how you have your 24 pin ATX
routing over that that sort of reservoir
bar inside of the case usually I see
people just touch it in a little bit
earlier beforehand but showing it off
yeah you're showing off you know you're
letting your freak flag fly fly peacock
feathers are are all out and it looks
like your eight pin cable is kind of
stretched across your vrm heatsink
almost almost fortuitously a little bit
I would probably tuck that up in the top
left corner if possible there's gonna be
a pastor up here yeah yeah there should
be but all the other cables look really
good cable management is just really
good apart from that one little that one
little detail I'll also say that
you could probably take off the sticker
on your your Nick on the Rio Rio there
on the motherboard the Ethernet one I
mean it does match technically because
it's blue but it also has the yellow
fonts on it and it's a nitpicky thing
but I guess that's a good thing that I
have to be 7/8 picky because the system
is mostly pretty much good to go
there's not a lot to complain about here
you could match up your fans in the case
you have a clear one not up top and just
a regular stock NZXT case fan at the
back I usually like to see those two
fans matching because they're so close
together and it helps tie things
together it also looks like you painted
your SSD to be blue or to have some blue
accents there which that's that's nice
it's good to the Samsung 850 Pro yeah
the Samsung label usually that's orange
on that right I appreciate that
yeah so that's a little detail there
looks like you got the right shade of
blue there and that's the other thing is
that the blue in your cables actually
matches the blue and the case perfectly
where with blue you go you often see
have the two types of like the sort of
royal blue that you have here and then
like the baby blue kind of like lighter
blue that was kind of a little bit older
that you found on the older generation
boards but this matches up perfectly so
good job I agree with everything Kyle
said the only thing I really wish here
is that this gtx 960 was a different
card like a 970 or one just one of the
ones that has the six pin or the eight
down on this end right and it's really a
minor thing again similar to the other
nitpicky things cow mentioned i just
feel like if that was going straight up
to a plug down here at the end of the
graphics card a lot cleaner just it just
feel a bit cleaner yeah but the 960 is a
good pairing with the i5 4690k that you
have so you know don't lose too much
base over it just for the bit yeah very
nice very well done with the color
scheme and everything final thing you've
got a single blue LED fan here at the
top I feel like either making both fans
led or you know or getting rid of that
onerous and somehow my I don't know yeah
right
right thank you since one of the clear
fans it's not clear heels that status
but and also only having LEDs at the top
of your case we're just from one source
also kind of casts like harsh shadows on
various parts of your belt and it
doesn't look quite as evenly lit as if
you were to have multiple sources of
lighting in your case so by taking Paul
suggestion actually adding like another
LED fan at the back ear case or even at
the front you could sort of even out
that that lighting but overall looks
good thanks Gunther Thank You Gunther
next up we have woven scout woven scout
with his build which is a core i5 7600 K
with a cooler master 240 light gigabyte
h 270 gaming 3 motherboard eight gigs of
crucial ddr4 and Asus GTX 1066 gigabyte
with Arctic Exelero aftermarket cooler
on it
extreme for plus a monster can for
support good measure and 128 gig ad to
nvme SSD inside of the corsair 100 arm
yeah interesting
Wow this is the only picture we have I
think so it's it's fairly low quality
okay but it was all we had and I thought
it was an interesting build so I picked
it anyway it looks like you've outgrown
the case just right off the bat
everything is so cramped in here
I mean you granted you have you were
able to fit a monster can in there but
still it looks like your hard drives
just chill them at the bottom that the
floor your case not really mountain to
anything and it looks just really feel
foster phobic just looking at this
picture then you go for a bigger case I
mean the 100-hour is great it's a great
value item but it's nowhere near like a
mid-range to high-end case for some of
the component that you have in here I'm
not I'm not liking the monster can yeah
I got it I gotta say the monster can
just there's things you can put in a
case that give it a little bit of flair
and maybe also act as a GPU support and
you've probably definitely definitely
need that GPU support since you have a
massive aftermarket cooler on a GTX 1060
which I would also be kind of curious
like how effective that cooler is maybe
it is maybe you've got a great overclock
on your GTX 760 with that you've also
got a bunch of heat sinks stacked on top
of it for additional cooling he sent the
GPU maxes out at 55 C Oh all right well
there you go I mean that's that's being
effective
I know those Arctic Exelero extreme
coolers are pretty effective when you
get a GPU that they're compatible with
yeah I just feel like removing that can
would provide easier air flow out of
your CPU cooler because right now it's
blocking a pretty significant piece of
that as far as easy ease of air flow
coming through from the front end take
fans and also just it's a can like it's
like it's kind of an eyesore doesn't
really yeah wish you know it's not like
an action figure like you know what
looks very calm you see like action
fingers or figurines and something like
that it's like it's kind of cool because
it looks like more of a diorama
when you go to college and you drink
like handles of alcohol and then you
saved the handles of alcohol and put
them up on the shelf as decoration
that's that's not it's not a good
decoration the same thing goes with the
can empty
I assume it's empty like half-drunk he
just replaces it everyday he cracks up
in a new monster but yeah I agree with
Paul there are brackets for sale to
correct the issue of GPU sag but I'm
sure you could find one that works with
your aftermarket cooler here and that
would open up some airflow at the front
of your case whether whether or not you
really need that airflow it just doesn't
look all that great to have a monster
can and you're in your computer I'm
gonna side with Paul on that one
and it looks like you only have one
stick of RAM in there what I can tell
maybe one for take advantage of looks no
only looks like the rightmost slot is
populated eight gigs of crucial
easier for so maybe I don't know get
another one of those and pop it into
dual channel mode and take advantage of
that consider relocating that hard drive
up to one of these five and a quarter
inch base an adapter you get an adapter
for that your cable management is pretty
clean yeah I mean for a 100 are its yeah
I'm good so there you go yeah I think
you could benefit from a new case GPU
sag bracket and hard drive reallocation
more more memory good suggestions all
right thank you thank you wolven
scheduling scout Todd I'm mr. Todd with
an i7 8700 K 4.9 gigahertz an h7 quad
Lumi from cryo rig the gigabyte Z 370
ultra gaming motherboard 2 by 8 gig
sticks of tritons e RGB the GTX 980 g1
gaming from gigabyte inside of the
fractal design mesh fic hey I like that
case it's got enough room but it's also
very small for what for a mid Tower it's
a really clean build actually cable
management is really good the Metra 5c
makes it easy but everything's routed in
the appropriate grommet and cut out it
looks like you've pretty much got just
like a black theme going on when when
when the system's not powered up and
then when it is you've got some RGB
obviously from the memory and the wind
force cooler the cryo rig the h7 quad
Louie I think the first thing that
stands out to me and this is just the
nature of your power supply is that you
have those red PCIe connectors this man
will take power supply will take ya this
is a trend that died a while back so
this must be an older power supply and
I'm glad this trend died because they
Victor's just look terrible in my
opinion they don't really match with
anything even like red accents in your
system yeah my wife's back it sounds
like she didn't desert me after all
mm-hmm
or it's an intruder failing all my shit
right now either one either one either
way at least we're not alone
as I would also suggest removing the SLI
covers for your graphics card simply
because there like that green or
turquoise or blue color I've seen SLI
finger covers that are all black before
that I would be okay being left on these
just stand out a little bit there they
don't match with the rest of the system
and removing those isn't gonna provide
it you know those aren't doing a crazy
amount of anything when it comes to
protection of those fingers right so
what was the processor here so you have
an 80 700 K at almost 5 gigahertz I
wonder if your attempts would go down a
bit if you added another intake fan at
the top this didn't take fan this set as
an intake right I couldn't tell because
of the angle yeah it looks like it okay
it looks like it to me but I think
another fan there would be some good
especially in the metro pcs just got all
that mesh at the front obviously kind of
unimpeded airflow at the front so I
don't know having another fan up there
would aim it right at that quad Lumi and
I think it would shave off a couple
degrees which couldn't hurt on an
overclocked 8,700 okay let's be honest
it would also balance out the front the
single fan that's looking a little oh
yeah right yeah you've definitely
prioritized it for the GPU which i think
is also a good call but give that CPU
some love to but that's pretty much all
I got for that it's pretty clean looking
system so thank you mr. Chad next up we
have Excalibur Excalibur our 7 1700 gtx
980ti for the win 3a be 350 pro for
motherboard 16 gigs of DDR for 3200
inside of once again at mesh if I see
that's coincidence I didn't realize when
I was picking these that they were mesh
if I sneeze back-to-back but looks like
he just took the advice that I just gave
which is having to intake fans at the
front yeah which looks very nice it's
evened out and both the CPU and GPU are
getting equal amounts of airflow there
and you've also got some figurines in
here looks like is that the the monkey
the ape from
I'm overwatch Carl no Winston George yes
that's the next thing I was gonna say
it's baby it looks like baby Winston
yeah baby a little baby Winston very
cute and then we also have a Metroid I'm
just like talking about the figurines
now I've been distracted so I blinded
Metroid attacking a broken can of spray
paint I'm not sure what that is so fast
yes but then I like the badges on the
bottom on the power supply shroud okay
add some add some some charisma to the
system and it looks like you've matched
it up it looks like you're going for
some some teal accents here with the
ring of the AMD Wraith stealth cooler I
think that's our a stealth or maybe it's
a spire and then a teal on the geforce
card looks really nice the cable
sleeving is really like like your cable
management is very clean but I'll say
that the cable extensions that you're
using look a little bit frayed are they
they just don't look a super straight
like you see in a lot of showpiece
builds and I think that's just a matter
of training the cables even even though
like they're in like in this current
condition that they're even hard to
train because once they're you know once
these cables get Warped it's hard to
bring them back to just that perfect
smooth curvature and straightness so I'm
not sure what can be done about that but
no I can't speak to the full time like
location of this PC but it looks like it
might be on the floor Halas triggers a
big faux pas just a big a big no-no
halls pin is sending any computer for
awesome hardware he's getting getting
angry if that is the case then this
layer of dust here on top of the power
supply shroud yeah it's probably going
to have built up a lot faster there than
it would have if you were to have taken
this PC which looks pretty nice and it
looks like you've done a fair amount of
investment in the aesthetics of maybe
move that up somewhere you can actually
see it and somewhere that you know to
accidentally kick it with your foot you
can use somewhere they won't get super
dusty all the time you can tell he
leaves us on before
because the cables are still plugged in
the back beyond that I would say this PC
mostly needs a CPU cooler upgrade
because the the Wraiths spire or I
believe that's the spire maybe that you
got in there is not bad by any stretch
it's a good like stock CPU cooler but
you got a 1080 TI in there you've spent
a decent amount of money on that maybe
consider upgrading your CPU cooler to
kind of be more online with that
high-end piece of kit right
and although you're using a be 350
motherboard which I believe is from
asrock which is a crazy good for power
delivery you might be able to get
yourself some lower temperatures may be
some better and sound some some quieter
operation with that yeah maybe even a
better overclock that today he has gonna
be giving off some serious heat under
load yeah and that heat is gonna go
straight into that dinky little stock
cooler for your CPU so yes thank you but
thank you very much Excalibur and then
finally we have Jason he is very self
aware of how atrocious this build is he
said I figured you guys would enjoy this
one it's four to nine years old so it's
a pretty wide range on floor on floor
sagginess dust cabling and go have fun
gentlemen half 9:32 that's an old-school
case I five 4690k
overclocked to four point three nine
gigahertz and an ASA tech 240 a IO 16
gigs of hyper X and we have a gtx 970
from msi inside of yeah half 932 we
don't even get a painted interior in
here and just look at these picture I
mean the dust on that power supply is
insane that's a good power supply yes
1000 yes I still have my HX 750 going
strong
damn that sag holy moly that's some
serious sag but it's also because just
the cables I think are just dragging it
down it looks like
I mean where do you even begin Abel sit
down we didn't even begin and look at
the the first picture with the CPU you
can see the hard drive just Harjo just
kind of hanging out three-ball in it
that's that's a bold choice for a
spinning mechanic right I'm sure it's
fine if it's just sitting there and I
mean obviously he's been using it for a
while sure it's probably just fine
functionally CDP no but certainly looks
awkward and I mean you're over there why
not just get the adapter for it for the
five and a quarter inch it can fit right
there it's perfect it's good to go
you're not even plugged into the the the
second optical drive there it's just
chillin we've got some of the clear
heels clear heels maybe fanboy clear
plastic red LED fans at the top yeah so
just just a piece of work a laundry list
of egregious egregious pimp my PC faux
pause here and I don't I don't know
where to begin
should we even attendance if you like me
just present this as an example of like
what not to do what not to do the other
thing is like the 9:32 if i ever it's
been a while since i built in the half
932 I think there is some space behind
the motherboard tray there's gaps here
right so there might be some ability to
rewire this thing it doesn't seem like
he cares at all you've also got the like
to eat the eight pin the CPU main cpu
main connector here plugged in there
routed eight at least it's tucked behind
the graphics card tucked behind the
graphics card God for that and then
coming back down to the power supply
there was some thought put into it yeah
but yeah this this makes thee cuz you
know that I did that joke video of how
not to build a PC where I tried to break
every rule in the book in PC building
and I feel like that build looks a
thousand times better than this one so
you really wrote the book on how to not
build a PC and sometimes that's the most
effective example is what not to do so
thank you for
but but also Jason also a good example
of why I pet my PC ultimately is is it's
just a vapid you know facade of vacuous
suggestions for aesthetic purposes
because this PC according to Jason is
four to nine years old I don't know what
happened in that mysterious five year
gap of how old this PC might be right
but obviously for at least four years
this PC is been working just fine so who
are we to judge it's true yeah I guess
joke's on us huh I guess so goddamnit
anyway nice thank you Jason for your
submission thanks all you guys for
sending in stuff for cutting my PC yep
and yeah we're gonna end the show we're
gonna end the show with some quick
donation yes we did all these get
replaced
I guess alright great thank you so

understand what this all means but I
kind of don't want to know I don't like
the PI part
well I'm wrong with PI now I'm just like

Kyle ashamed of you for not going to e3
this year haha JK seriously tho next
year maybe PS 5 and Xbox scarlet
potentially obviously e3 conflicted with
my travels in Asia this year III is an
event I've only attended once and I
didn't have the greatest experience the
first time around because I feel like
you really need to know industry
contacts in the gaming field in order to
make the most of that event to get the
inside scoop and to be able to cut all
the lines that you know the plebs have
to wait in so I don't know it'll it
remains to be seen whether or not to go
to an e3 anytime soon but any any
interest in e3 oh I mean I'm it's never
been something that I rejected outright
based on what it is itself it's always
just been way too close to Computex and
I I know how jet lag is for me coming
back from Asia and I don't want to deal
with anything in the in the week after I
get back right that's that involves
especially when you're jet-lagged yeah
it's just I just I just know how it is
and so I don't wanna deal with it if he
3 was like 2 weeks plus after Computex
would or it might be in the future
depending on how scheduling goes then
I'd be totally opening open to go yeah
yeah well let me know if you do okay
alright next up we have one from Tom's
brooms bits Tom Justino region cronic
I'll let Paul but Paul pull one hair you
just won't let that go will you Tom gosh
by the way Kylie rap song was awesome
listened to it like 10 times in a row I
want it on Spotify PS Paul htpc thanks
me I don't know it bikes may mean
something in Norwegian speaking
Norwegian chronic that's Norwegian krone
a language thank you for the compliments
on the rap song and I don't think it'll
ever be on Spotify though I did briefly
think about the HTPC early
is your HDTV video Paul that's coming I
need to figure out what stuff with with
the wood can someone find out the date
11 months ago where Paul was first asked
on this show about htpc my actual HTTP
see video is 11 months ago okay so it's
probably it was probably the show right
that once part 2 coming they probably
didn't waste any time so almost a year
now well you know it's the most highly
anticipated Paul's Hardware video you'll
never watch building up
he used to master he's a master at
content releasing and scheduling so stay
tuned for that all right next up we have
Jason twelve dollars and thirty four
cents one two three four which case
would you suggest for a mid to high end
build eighty seven hundred K
Coolermaster H 500m or a fractal design
define our six or a cougar Panzer thanks
guys
man those are all great cases those are
all really good and it's really gonna
boil down to which one you think looks
the best maybe which one has the most
airflow if you are trying to split hairs
with the temperatures that can be
achieved with either case and the price
point that fits you I haven't messed
with the Cougar Panzer myself I would
say if you're very concerned about
access to 3.5 inch drives then the H 500
M is probably not the best choice
because this there's this power supply
cover here and it's right in front of
the cage oh yeah and it's the opposite
side it splits yeah yeah did you mention
that your review - I didn't really
review it I just saw but yeah I'm
reviewing it right now and that
particular configuration sucks yeah that
was like my big problem with it was the
hard drive configuration so yeah
obviously the rs6 has tons of great has
a really good layout for a lot of three
and a half inch drives cougar panther
I've never worked with either but I've
heard it's a really good case I think
Jays worked with it before and he's
spoken highly of it
so yeah good luck good luck on your
choice park may five dollars and sixty
nine cents PC build challenge for Kyle
speed build a PC without using one
sexual innuendo aka Mission Impossible
well that would be pretty difficult for
me but I think I think I would have to
like bring bring like my mom into the
room just to make sure that I didn't
because because I wouldn't say it in
front my mom you know it'd just be too
should be too awkward that'd be hard
what do you be so hard you things would
get stiff pretty quickly
I can't erection of the penis
okay thank you for that everyone thank
you for that question
Dixon software solutions $20 I am a
lucky 8086 Kay giveaway winner
congratulations one day to AMD for
nineteen fifty X I would want to build a
highly overclocked ITX system what case
do you recommend to maximize Brady or
capacity but minimize size hoping for at
least two 360s in a single graphics card
what how all right Mini ITX look - 360
360 right that's a full site that's a 48
how is it because your 360s are gonna be
in the front and in the top those are
the practical locations for that I don't
know any like reasonably sized small
mini ITX case that has two 360 rad
mounts on it you wouldn't even need to
360 rads maybe two Fermoy TX cuz you're
only gonna have one GPU yeah you're not
gonna need more than two 240s at the
very most I mean there's there is an
argument to like if you're going water
cooling to go with like max radiator
size because you get a lot of heat
dissipation and you can run your you can
run your fans really slow because ITX
though yeah why do you need two three
six i would exist i would say based on
what you want consider micro ATX or even
full-size ATX because you know you're
not gonna get something that small with
radiators that big at least to my
knowledge the most you can do with a
mini ITX case is two to four TS i think
yeah for the most part with like a nano
defined an OS or something like that
which are you plenty maybe take a look
at the bent x evolved shift i think
that's a unique mini ITX case it has
some decent radiator support in there
it's different
yeah it'll stand out a little bit for
you I think the shift X is even you
has more water effects but it is fairly
larger yeah but the footprint is the
same if you're stacking it vertically so
that might be something that interests
you yeah but if if you're really
interested in that in that and having
that radiator capacity like just just
look at micro ATX cases yeah because you
might as well like you you limit
yourself a little bit when you're going
8 ITX completely and you might have more
flexibility just going a little bit
bigger
yeah but Congrats again on the win
that's it yeah it's all CPU awesome job
all right at a 13 dollars and 37 cents
from not mentioned no name I'm guessing
it's MB 67 because he usually donates 13
dollars and 37 cents you're probably
right so thank you MB 67
maybe 67 right I think it's a seven
Thank You MB kinda liked your coverage
of Computex and the part one japan vlog
as well keep up the great work
Cheers thank you I worked hard on the
copy text coverage and the Japan vlog
was very fun very fun to make them glad
you guys enjoyed watching it cuz I
enjoyed making it
Brendan Gallagher $10 Kyle which are you
wearing also with the 1050 TI be
perfectly fine for 720p gaming I am
wearing a shirt that someone randomly
gave me at Computex when we were at we
might have been at an industry party oh
no I was on the show floor someone just
handed me the shirt it might have been a
vendor like here take this does this
look like a familiar logo to you at all
at first I was like like a cougar is it
cougar I don't know this is the Cougar
logo guys it says blink blink great
blink that says blinker okay I never
noticed that so I guess blink blink I'm
not sure I can't remember who gave me
this shirt but I've been wearing it ever
since it fits me really well and you
know it's black I usually wear black so
yeah it's it's a nice shirt it's got a
cool design of a tiger cheetah panther
it's a cougar Jaguar cougar
somebody somebody cat animal just
blinking cougar
but thank you and then also with a 1050
t I'd be perfectly fine for 720p King
yes it absolutely would you can even do
1080 high settings for most games tenor
brush grabber brochure Burt Tanner $5
per brush i per brush
I even like mentions how to phonetically
say I love you guys gamers Nexus wifey
sauce and self processing - any thoughts
on the in win Mars fans thank you all
for that you do or well thank you for
all that you do the in win Mars fans
those are the ones that have the
flexible articulating arms right and the
ones you consider the position in your
case however you want
am i right yes okay I actually thought
those are really cool and I was
surprised that I didn't see them at
Computex again this year because are
they already released I saw them last
year I feel like right yeah they were
there they were definitely there last
year but I haven't seen anyone used them
I haven't seen them in anyone anyone's
case I haven't seen reviews I don't ever
even caught wind that they had actually
been released and it doesn't look like
I'm clicking on shopping on Google
within win Mars fan I don't see them
there so yeah I don't know I really like
the idea the concept behind them because
I mean yeah sometimes you just want to
position a fan exactly where you want to
position it it makes sense there are
certain hot spots in a build that the
conventional fan mounting spots don't
always hit that you know they're not
always optimally placed you can buy them
directly from the in wind official east
or they're $60 each holy shit nevermind
yeah no that's never mind anyway um
Regis that's absurd
$60 worth fan just do it yourself at
that point I mean they had a good thing
going where like they actually have the
fan mount it mounts to a regular fan
mount in your case and then you can
articulate it I think that's a great
clever way to do it but $60 there's no
way
maybe it's just $60 on their website
than any retailers that sell it
significant no I mean I was looking for
retailers I didn't really see it
currently we I don't know what that said
such a quick pop up the Morrow's fan
price $59 no way Wow oh my girl buzz way
too much I'm sorry zero reviews someone
should go review this and say it's too
expensive but that's the fan though you
can mom I got a little arm you can
articulate it alright so I'm gonna have
you very kindly cut off all donations
oh yeah it's really here now because
there's already so many more that we
have to go through many and I need to
get home at some point before I crash
yeah
Vignesh bala again Vignesh Cygnus be six
dollars and six to brahmani yeah Paul
really likes the challenge not super
money him oh yeah he yeah
Balasubramanyam Vignesh bella super
number you Hey nice Oh super nominee oh
cool
great job with my name promise to show
off my build on the next pick my PC
awesome by the way how can I remove case
logos printed on steel oh good luck with
that yeah you're gonna need some crazy
modification tools and experience the
only way I would know is if the steel is
already like brushed and then you could
like sand it in the same direction as
the brushing but not then that's really
challenging to do without just like
we're anything over it or something
right yeah good luck maybe look up some
forum posts perhaps to help you with
that Douglas Park Ned jr. $5 just to be
fair here you go Kyle thank you I
appreciate your pity donation thank you
very much Douglas it is much appreciated
Aaron Baker $5 always enjoy and look
forward to this every Tuesday I'm out of
beer so I'm having a Texas drink of Dr
Pepper with Texas mesquite crown Royale
Cheers
I've never had crown and dr. pepper
before but I think it would make sense I
feel like dr. pepper is not too far off
from coke and cranberry al is delicious
and as well with most things so thanks
for the idea
I'll try that sometime and I'm glad that
we are
your favorite thing about Tuesdays that
is gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside
$20 from someone it just says someone
GPU sag makes the air flow smoother duh
obviously I mean you should know that
kind of Joker doesn't know that so I
usually tell people you don't even need
fans in your system just sag the shit
out of your GPU VPS customs hey it's

thank you very much for the donation you
didn't have to do that thank you Brian

San Diego land five dollars hope to see
you at the first ever PC gaming room at
San Diego comic-con this year
hey you we were talking to your friend
we're told we have 24 hours to respond
yes actually are any of you guys going
to comic-con San Diego comic-con
next month let us know because Paul and
I might keyword might have an
opportunity to go this year which would
be my first time and I don't know six or
seven years I never even went directly
to comic-con I went to like a place next
door to comic country we went to nerd HQ
HQ right so that's that's the closest
I've ever been to like we were there but
we weren't actually there true like I
didn't get to see Adam Savage walking
around in his costume
oh yeah and all the other great things
it has a tradition at Comic Con he just
was figuring out who Adam Savage is I
hope I hope this year he goes this Jamie
[Laughter]
they did that on the show once oh did
they yeah heads masks made so so this
may potentially be mine Paul's very
first official comic-con experience
would love to see you guys there if
you're
there and if we decide to go but thank
you very much sand Eagle and hopefully
we'll see you there if we decide to go
as well you would be our ticket in
essentially let me call the work
together on that we'll follow up with
you shortly
Jason $5 I'm crying here thanks guys I
plan on pulling that awful build apart
and rebuilding it maybe I'll submit
after pictures cheers and skull
yeah dude please let us know or send
send me some some images of the new and
improved build if you guys don't don't
remember he was the last bill that we
looked at for pin my PC the one that had
the crazy sag and the cables everywhere
in half a 932 I would love to see some
after pictures that would be great that
would be a perfect candidate for a
before and after type of event so thank
you very much for that Jason appreciate
a man David Lapsley $5 doing my first
everything doing my first everything PC
build custom loop custom cable making

that's gonna be like a hundred hour of
project so Godspeed good luck to you on
all that especially the custom cable
making that's the only part that scares
me I have this list but it's fun though
I'm sure it's gonna be it's it's so
worth if you have the time for it if you
have the time it's fun and the patients
invitations time and patience
good luck tweeted some images of the
finished product to let me see it Jerald

arrogant Americans and ruch warrior
Schreyer five Canadians help a bro out
and look at Vignesh as PC in ger blink
and stuff PS replaced hyphens with
slashes we're supposed to look at this
piece yes
Vignesh vignette she done it at my side
he dried it on your side but like but
why he was 76 minutes ago right I
remember him well he wants his PC to be
reviewed on pip my PC oh we're all right
so I'm gonna do that now or should we do
it you you you or the arbitrator of fit
my PC let's see it or so
I think this is it this is this popped
up immediately after just typing in the
little code that they gave confused it's
a thermal take thermaltake case then
we'll take with that a Poseidon that's
an issues beside in card game at Cal
just take a quick look take a quick look
he does after all have the most badass
name that we've seen on the show so far
so I guess that warrants a quick look at
his PC there that must be it
there's no way that's a coincidence that
some other random person's PC showed up
biggie biggie yeah it's gotta be big
that's all thing McNish all right you
suckered us in so it looks pretty clean
man it's actually really clean yeah see
LG freesync mother have you tweeted this
to me for as a net emojis he's got stats
for his desk
I wouldn't all be top and the can't legs
from Ikea good lord LG 35 for its

phantom mechanical keyboard of course
they're m65 Pro RGB Mouse Verizon 7

free sync monitor g.skill ripjaws 534 66
megahertz memory as rock X 470
motherboard master SLI AC samsung 512
gig SSD and of course our arms m50x
power supply then we'll take core p3 T G
case it's a nice build yeah super clean
and looks like you spent a lot of money
on the system I would spend I like the
money I like the white cable extensions
I would potentially upgrade your
speaker's next okay that does kind of
stand out I mean since we get the full
desk look everything else is so premium
and high quality and then the speakers
look like they're
like 1995 or something that's true
but who knows they could be super it
could be sleepers they can be sleeper
speakers the PC itself though is looking
super clean yeah I mean I was about to
say from this side the the tubing here
looks like it's stretched but but when
you look at it fairness there it's
actually not angle is that right very
clean on your GPU Cairo and your 24 pin
I like the exposed cables coming out of
the the power supply itself as well so
yeah super clean build there I'd almost
like to see a bit more splash of red
throughout the build instead of just the
card like I don't know I think some like
ready we like some red rip just five
would look really nice just purely
aesthetic at this point because
everything else is perfect yeah so I'm
just nitpicking and stuff but overall
really nice setup big yeah other than
that I mean it's really the whole desk
setup that that we need to upgrade that
to match the look of the PC I think yeah
very nice very nice clean set linen
Vignesh and then finally we have septic
line five Canadian I sell my RX 480 for
300 Canadian for a gtx 1070 TI for a
1440 monitor or wait for next gen so
lower prices ideally sooner than better
sooner the better but should i wait
right now yes
trade your 484 a 1070 TI yeah prices are
dropping the high prices of AM D GPUs
are dropping a little bit more slowly
than they than the Nvidia ones so you're
getting a lot more performance out of a
1070 TI which is essentially a GTX 1080
like at reference blocks basically oh
Clark that sheet so yeah I think that's
pretty solid advice if you can if you
can get that straight across I would
definitely do that upgrade
and yeah sooner the better is probably
also a good a good solution there yeah
that's all we have for donations thank
you guys so much see it we're gonna do a
twitch raid Johnson's after we do
