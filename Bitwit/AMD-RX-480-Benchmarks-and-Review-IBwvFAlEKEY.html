first GPU based on the new Polaris
architecture aimed at mainstream gamers
throughout the PC Kingdom the R X 480
promises smooth gaming and fluid VR
experiences for significantly less coin
than the current market offerings MSRP
of the reference 8 gig model comes in at
239 while the 4 gig reference card sits
at just 199 us that's equivalent to just
180 euros or as of last week 500,000
British pounds while AMD in recent years
has sometimes been regarded as the
economical choice in lieu of performance
compared to its competitors over the
last few weeks a number of leaked
benchmarks and invidious price drop on
all their 900 series GPUs clued us in
the team read could be bringing more to
the table than just attractive MSRP s
with its new card sporting the new 14
nanometer FinFET process and 4th gen GC
and architecture the R X 480 features
the latest support for DirectX 12 and
Vulcan AMD freesync HDR and the ability
to stream and record gameplay up to 4k
with h.265 at 60fps on the chip we get
36 compute units 2300 and 4 stream
processors a bass and boost clock of
eleven hundred and twenty and twelve
hundred and sixty six megahertz
respectively and either four or eight
gigs of gddr5 on a 256 bit bus the die
shrink comes with improved power
efficiency over the last generation as
well but the TDP of 150 watts taking a
closer look at AMD's new reference
cooler we see it features an enclosed
plastic shroud with a single 75
millimeter blower style fan that ejects
air out the back it also has a single 6
pin power connector facing the front
side of the card on the top we find that
the cooler actually extends beyond the
relatively short PCB making the total
card length nine and a half inches or
241 millimetres you won't find a sexy
backplate here unfortunately but the
cooler does look very nice with its
textured surface and straightforward
design on the back you'll find no signs
of DVI just three DisplayPort 1.4 and a
single HDMI on the software side of
things AMD also introduces their new
tweaking utility called wot man which
makes me think all overclocking tools
should be given fun superhero names this
program effectively replaces AMD
overdrive in the global Radeon settings
and his skin with a sleek modern UI with
a nice assortment of adjustable
parameters when overclocking the rx 480
in wot man
I maxed out the power limit to 50% and
managed to increase the core clock speed
by just 4.5% before reaching instability
taking the maximum boost clock to 13
hundred and 25 megahertz the RX for 80
may not be the overclocking champ we
always hope a new video card will be but
there's a fair chance we'll be able to
squeeze more juice out with aftermarket
cards sporting more than just a
reference 6 pin power plug memory clock
speed was more forgiving going as far as
the slider could take it to 20 250
megahertz all of this was done without
touching the voltage and as of now
voltage values in watt man can only be
assigned for each DPM state manually
though AMD is looking into adding a
voltage offset slider later on for fan
control you can assign a minimum rpm so
your fan never spins below the assigned
value and target which is the fastest
the fan will run at if the card is not
above its temp target you can also set a
minimum acoustic limit in megahertz that
dictates the threshold at which
acoustics can be violated user options
for temperature control include a max
value where the GPU will throttle down
the clock speed if it hits that assigned
temperature and target indicates how hot
the GPU can get before ramping up the
fan for all my overclocked testing I set
my max to 83 degrees Celsius and my
target to 80 with these parameters I did
encounter some thermal throttling on the
overclocked our X 480 with the max GPU
temp itting a toasty 85 degrees Celsius
and the core clock speed averaging
twelve hundred and ninety two megahertz
compared to our max clock speed of again
thirteen hundred and twenty five it's
not an alarming loss but it is
significant enough to mention so I'm
looking forward to seeing this effect
minimized with the arrival of custom
coolers fortunately the reference card
does a nice job in the acoustics
department it stays comfortably quiet at
low to mid rpms and even at the 60
percent fan speed I tested at the fan
outputs a fairly calm humming noise
that's pretty non intrusive and quite
impressive for a reference design
before we take to the benchmarks here's
a look at the total system power draw
featuring the cards I tested at
reference speeds the RX 486 just about
as much power as the EVGA super super
clocked GTX 970 and when overclocked
consumes more than all of our Nvidia
cards but is still well below the Nitro
r9 390 which as we're about to see
yields an impressive performance per
watt with the exception of the RX 480
all the cards in today's tests are
factory overclocked models and have not
been manually tweaked by me in any way
however if you've been following the
news lately you may have heard that msi
gtx 1070 was being shipped to reviewers
with a pre tweaked firmware that set the
cards to an aggressive OC profile so
I've gone ahead and switched that to the
gaming profile which more accurately
reflects the clock speeds retail
consumers can expect out of the box
only our RX 480 will be showing both
reference and manually over clock speeds
today our testbed features a gigabyte
gaming g1 Wi-Fi with a 5820k overclocked
240 400 megahertz and 16 gigs of DDR for
all games tested were run in Windows 10
at 1920 by 1080 and 2560 by 1440 using
the latest drivers from Nvidia and the
pre-release press drivers straight from
AMD without further ado here are the
benchmarks
all right so those are the results while
most of them since the GPU does feature
async shaders I did run a quick test for
DirectX 12 performance in ashes of the
singularity and found a 20 percent
increase over DirectX 11 in average
frame rates at 1080 and rather marginal
games at higher resolutions overall it
looks like there's still a bit of room
for improvement on the async compute
front throughout our testing the cards
max VRAM usage fit around 5 gigs which
certainly advocates having more than a
four gig frame buffer these days even at
sub 4k resolutions now to make sense of
today's numbers I've calculated the
overall gaming performance of each card
by averaging the average frame rates
across all games not confusing at all
the end result shows that our
overclocked rx 488 gig model fared just
0.6 percent slower than the super super
clocked GTX 970 3.8 percent slower than
the Nitro r9 390 and a whopping 59%
faster than the msi gtx 960 and hitman
we saw the RX 4 80 best the gtx 970 and
r9 390 at both resolutions and in crysis
3 it beats out the GTX 970 at 1920 by
1080 this is kind of exciting when you
consider that the RX 480 is using its
first pre-release driver versus the
highly mature drivers of its competitors
while it would have been awesome to see
VR X 480 beat out the GTX 970 more
consistently here where the Polaris chip
takes a slight loss in raw performance
it makes up in terms of value with the
RX 488 gig priced at 239 bucks
it nearly delivers 2 frames per dollar
edging out the 1.5 FPD of the super
super clock GTX 970 and scoring well
above the other cards even if we're to
use in videos new price drop with the
toss and rebate of $259 the GTX 970
would still only yield 1.8 frames per
dollar and that's presumably for a non
factory overclocked model that would
score lower than our super super clock
Edition today so if we're following the
numbers here the RX 480 at least the 8
gig model I've tested packs in quite an
amazing value for performance that
trails closely behind and occasionally
outperforms the notably more expensive
gtx 970 and r9 390 it's not the greatest
overclocker and it does suffer from some
moderate throttling but hopefully the
custom board partners can deliver the
cooling and power delivery needed to
turn things around if you simply can't
wait for the aftermarket models AMD's
new reference cooler appears on the warm
side without the proper tuning but
offers an acoustic profile less
atrocious than what we've seen in the
past but that is gonna do it for now
guys so let me know what you all think
of this new card in the comments and
don't forget to toss me a like on this
video if you enjoyed it before you go
feel free to pick up an awesomesauce
shirt in my store they're sure to turn
some heads especially if you're not
wearing pants
as always I'm Cowell with awesome saws
