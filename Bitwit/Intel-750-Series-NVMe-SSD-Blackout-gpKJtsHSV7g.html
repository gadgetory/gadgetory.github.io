received an unexpected package from
Intel inside the mysterious box was a
skylake 6700 K CPU and a 400 gig model
of their latest 750 series nvme SSD
since then the CPU has already been put
to work in my recent skylake built
churning out benchmarks for your viewing
pleasure but what about the solid-state
drive what purpose would it serve me
other than collecting dust on my
neglected product shelf well one night I
awoke to the shrill cries of someone or
something uttering the words me put it
in me not knowing whether to be scared
or excited I crept out of bed to
investigate the ominous howl as I walk
towards my office door the cry grew
louder and louder like the sound of a
thousand console gamers in distress with
a trembling hand I turned the cold knob
and swung the door open storming into my
office knowing this time might be my
last surely I was now face to face with
a ghoul a ghost
a wandering crack whore perhaps but no
there on the benchmarking table was hot
line my custom water-cooled PC with the
Virgin Drive at his feet once more he
bellowed out his tormented plea me he
cried put the SSD in me I haven't been
able to sleep since that night and now
I'm actively seeking a good Kensington
lock for hotline not for his protection
but for mine nevertheless it would break
my little heart to deny him this one
request so today I have come to the
decision that the 750 series SSD will
live inside of my possessed pepto rig
from now until the end of time well
maybe not that long just sounded cool
however there's just one problem the
antiquated silver and green color scheme
of the SSD would look pretty gosh-darn
awful inside my heavily stylized rig so
keeping aesthetics in mind I'd say it's
about time we give this drive a
transformative paint job
all right and here is the finished
product in case you were wondering I
refrained from adding any pink or gray
accents in order to preserve the drives
color neutrality in case I decide to
swap it into another system later down
the line although I chose not to
suffocate the green PCB with paint the
grotesque hue definitely appears more
subdued against the black enclosure than
the original silver one and apart from
one or two minor blemishes in the paint
I'm wholeheartedly satisfied with the
drives new stealthy appearance the end
result is certainly a cosmetic win for
hotline and the horrific sobs and the
Knights have since then fallen silent as
an added bonus the awesome read and
write speeds of this drive make me a
winner too especially in my future video
editing endeavors
perhaps I'll even do a video with some
performance tests once the new rig is
all settled in but that's gonna do it
for now guys so let me know what you
