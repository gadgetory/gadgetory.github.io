channel today i am doing part two of
February's pc of the months which is
this little guy right here next to me I
know we're already deep into March at
this point but that's generally how PC
of the month goes the first of the build
video part one goes up the month it's
supposed to most of the time and then
part two is generally going to slip into
the next month sometimes especially with
all the like the Verizon and GTX 1080i
stuff going around right now I'm a
little bit delayed on this so hopefully
that's okay by you but today is very
exciting this is literally one of the
smallest rigs that I've ever assembled
inside of the nkm one it's super tiny so
that means the two biggest enemies for
today in our testing are probably going
to be heat and acoustics as generally
those two elements tend to suffer when
you're going with a very small
form-factor chassis now that being said
we do have some pretty impressive
hardware in here which of course is also
going to lead us to higher thermals and
things like that
so we've got a 7700 K which I have
overclocked for today up to 5 gigahertz
and that was at one point three eight
five volts now of course there are
plenty of other 7700 k's out there that
can hit 5 gigahertz at a much lower
voltage than what mine was able to
achieve today however that's just luck
of the draw when it comes to the silicon
lottery the temperatures we were seeing
in GTA 5 after about twenty to thirty
minutes of gameplay on the 7700 K
package was about eighty-five degrees
Celsius at the max so it was not
operating at 85 C constantly but that is
the highest recorded temperature that
was seen on the package to under load so
in actuality we were seeing temperatures
range from the mid 60s to the high 70s
which again isn't fantastic but when you
consider how small the package that
we're dealing with here in terms of
chassis size and limited case airflow
that's really not too bad and of course
we're still staying within you know safe
operating temperatures that intel's
designated for the 7700 k we weren't
seeing any sort of thermal throttling or
anything like that and again we are
pushing this to the extreme of 5
gigahertz a very high clock speed indeed
now our graphics card was also
overclocked and just as a refresher
that's the gigabyte gtx 1070 mini which
does come factory overclocked him we
took it even further than what was out
of the box so we actually put in a 135
megahertz offset on the core clock which
took us to about over 2 gigahertz over
two gigahertz mark at its max core clock
frequency however when we started
playing games and temperature started to
rise up GPU boost kind of dialed it down
a little bit until it rested at nineteen
hundred and forty nine megahertz from
nineteen hundred and fifty there abouts
which is still very solid it's a really
nice overclock we also overclock the
memory clock twenty one hundred and
seventy seven megahertz is what we were
able to achieve with a three hundred and
twenty five megahertz offset as far as
temperatures are concerned I was very
impressed to see our GP you get no
hotter than seventy six degrees Celsius
in today's testing which is awesome I
mean when you consider that the graphics
card itself is a smaller version of a
regular-sized GTX ten seventy we've got
a smaller heat sink that we're working
with you know smaller surface area we've
got a single fan design all that sort of
thing stacks up and it really doesn't
seem to do much in the GPUs favored when
it comes to thermal design however we're
seeing a completely different story and
I think that's a huge testament to
gigabyte cooler design with this
particular card as well as that 120
millimeter cougar fan that I'd stuck
right underneath the GPU delivering
fresh air flow to the graphics card
under load now one of the main reasons I
selected this cougar fan for this build
is because I know it's very effective at
delivering airflow but not at the cost
of outputting too many noise emissions
it's a very quiet fan so that being said
my main concern for the acoustics test
today was going to be the two corsair
fans that are on our h 100 i which are
being run at the auto fan setting right
out of the box there's no custom fan
curve for today i kind of just want to
see what the h 100 i would do on its own
as well as the single fan that's on our
gtx 1070 from gigabyte I'm not exactly
sure going into this test how
acoustically sound that particular fan
is so without further ado here's a quick
listen at both ours
speaking of loud noises Jesus as I was
saying here's a quick sound test
comparing both idle and load acoustics
well I'll be damned this little mini PC
here is not nearly as loud as I
anticipated I mean when I first was
going into this acoustic stuff before I
actually put it under load I was
thinking this may very well be jet
engine territory because we're dealing
with a really small chassis but a lot of
high-end hardware crammed into it and
we're overclocking those components to
relatively high degree so I didn't
really expect the best and what we found
was not the best I mean it's not silent
by any means you can still hear it in a
quiet room however if you're gaming with
some headphones or even like I was you
know maybe at ten fifty percent volume
in GTA v when I was doing my own
personal test and I could barely hear
the system over that I mean of course
combined with the window AC unit that
kind of outputs a really faint humming
noise it was really not obtrusive at all
in terms of just the system the fan
noise and things like that so good on
you for for making some really quiet
fans of their Corsair gigabyte and
cougar I think on that note the last
thing we can check out today is the
gaming benchmarks of course with all of
this system overclocks now that we've
got everything figured out we can
actually see how this guy performs in
games so we've got I think eight games
that were testing today a really nice
benchmark suite that should give us a
really good indicator of just how fast
this guy is we've also got both
resolutions tested 1920 by 1080 as well
as 1440 that's sixteen by nine not 34 40
by 1440 but 2560 by 1440 I did not
specify that with 21 by nine becoming
more popular but no 4k benchmarks
because I don't know gtx 1070 is more of
a quad HD sort of sweet spot or you know
a high refresh rate 1080p cards than it
is really a 4k so but that being said
latest Nvidia drivers were used at the
time of filming this video Windows 10 64
bits everything's good
we're looking good let's go ahead and
just run run the benchmark slides I
don't know what what kind of music
should we play today
we do should be fruity some metal
whichever maybe we'll switch it up we'll
do some we'll do some a little different
I haven't exactly figured out yet but
I'm sure
post-production Kyle will find the
perfect track for today's benchmarks
pop-up god no that's just okay you know
forget it just let's just go back to
meddle yeah
so there you guys have the results
overall a very solid performer which is
clearly evidenced by today's numbers and
even at 1440p we were seeing well over
60 FPS on average in a lot of these
triple-a games at Ultra settings which
is just awesome granted it is an
expensive expensive system at $2,000
it's not cheap but you do get what you
pay for and just the fact that we're
able to achieve some really nice
temperatures here with low acoustics and
still get that tiny-ass footprint is
really really impressive so big things
come in small packages as my wife always
says so it's clearly indicated by these
results today so if you guys have any
feedback on this system go ahead and
leave it in the comments below and if
you enjoyed this video be sure to toss
me a like on it it helps me a lot but
that's going to do it for now guys also
feel free to subscribe to the channel
