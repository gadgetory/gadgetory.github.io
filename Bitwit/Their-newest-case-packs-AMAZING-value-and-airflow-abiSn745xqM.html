to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info what's
going on guys welcome back to the
channel so I just got back from the
fantex booth and they had a lot of cool
stuff let's dive right in first off they
have their new revolt series of power
supplies this is actually a
collaboration they've done with good old
see sonic see sonic is a very reputable
brand when it comes to power supplies I
use them in a lot of builds they're very
trustworthy and super reliable it's kind
of nice to see both these brands that I
really like a lot come together to build
this new series so first off we've got
the revolt X which is a 1200 watt power
supply the beauty of this thing is that
we're pretty much using all of the same
sort of reliable component tree that
we're familiar with with C Sonic but now
fantex has come in and added their own
very their very own power splitter built
into the unit so if you're familiar with
the power splitter that was a standalone
unit that fantex came out with a while
back this is basically the same exact
thing but already integrated into the
unit itself so this allows you to power
two systems simultaneously which is
gonna be great for several kinds of dual
system scenarios for example if you have
a gaming PC and workstation in a single
chassis or if you have a workstation PC
and a server right next to it or for
example a gaming and streaming pc I
think is an obvious one for a lot of us
and also if you just have a very limited
space but you have two desks with two
separate users and you want to just
consolidate it to one system that would
be another application and the list goes
on really it's kind of whatever you can
imagine so this is actually really nice
there's a very efficient power
regulation with the way that they have
set this up there is continuous load
sharing going on which actually actually
increases the efficiency between both
systems this is also going to clean up
your cable management significantly
because you only have one power supply
to deal with you know of course you've
got two sets of cables going from that
one unit but it's still going to be a
lot less clutter and a lot less to
manage overall than having two separate
power supplies also we've got a fully
modular design 80-plus platinum
efficiency which is great
solid Japanese kept capacitors
and this is gonna be available around
the end of q1 and fantex is promising us
that they're going to be very
competitively priced with other 1200
watt units on the market currently
except those units will not have the
power splitter built in or any of the
functionality we just talked about so
that's really cool
additionally we've got a second revolt
revolt pro that can come in either an
850 watt or 1000 watt variety this
basically integrates fan Texas very own
power combo rather than the power
splitter and this is going to allow
users to basically add a second power
supply to drive a single system so you
can combine the total power output of
two power supplies to drive your rig
essentially so there's a custom PCB that
fantex is put in there and everything
several uses from this product may
include you know high-end gaming rig for
example pro workstation data server
mining machine I think would be a very
popular choice right about now
the upgrade ability here is is
definitely a feature let's say you have
a you start off with like a 500 600 watt
power supply and later on you you add in
more high-end components maybe you want
to do a multi GPU setup if you if your
case supports it instead of having to
buy a completely new power supply keep
your existing one and just add on
another one that's maybe less wattage
which could also save you quite a bit of
money in the long run so the unit
features continuous load sharing which
is going to improve the overall
efficiency when you're in dual PSU mode
and then on top of all that I think
we're done in C is going to be the
biggest selling point here because if
one power supply goes down or fails for
pretty much any reason other than a
blackout for example your other power
supply will keep the system running the
whole time it won't shut down and you
won't lose any data so that's a very
valuable feature to say the least what's
really nice about this unit is that you
can pretty much add any other brand
power supplied to it and still take
advantage of all the features you don't
need to revolt pros or to fantex power
supplies in order to take advantage of
everything here so that just adds a lot
more flexibility later down the line if
you choose to add a unit to the mix
additionally we're getting all the same
features that we saw on the last units
including fully modular design Japanese
capacitor
and this is gonna be releasing end of q1
once again for a very competitive price
moving on we have the eclipse p3 50x
this is a case we're getting into the
cases now this is the only new case they
really had at least brand new case from
fantex at CES 2018 this is a compact ATX
mid tower that pretty much is in between
the P 300 and P 400 in terms of feature
set and price this is actually going to
retail for $69 very very nice sort of
price range there and it's going to have
integrated RGB lighting at the front
which is going to be supported by you
know ASIS or a sync mystic light from
MSI etc or you can actually have just
wired up straight to your case and
control it with a couple buttons on the
front panel which is very nice and
flexible and we have lots of mesh
ventilation at the front panel so it
didn't look like there was going to be
any sort of constriction for airflow for
those front intake fans it looks like
very open and the mesh itself is
actually spaced apart from the fans it's
not like on the side of the fans or
really close to the fans it's giving
ample room for that air to really
breathe in additionally we've got a full
length GPU and power supply supports I
should mention tempered glass Sipan will
come standard that's very nice
front radiator support up to 240 or 280
and note no radiator support at the top
that's just for fans although they do
include a nice magnetic
dust filter that's removable and you do
get rear add support at 120 and yeah
very competitively priced $69 I think
that you're getting a lot of bang for
your buck with with a P 350 X there
moving on we've got a digital RGB
controller that is new to the market
here for fantex you can actually control
the lighting either with the three
button remote that comes included very
simple to use color effects and
brightness or you can sync it with a
digital RGB supported motherboard and
use any of the various motherboard
software's out there so that's nice and
flexible we've got a magnetic backing as
well so you can stick this pretty much
anywhere in your case you don't have to
worry about using some adhesive or you
know screwing it down somewhere so
that's really nice moving on we have
another similar products to sort of
complement the last one this is the
digital RGB expansion hub this is going
to allow users to really increase the
number of supported RGB or digital RGB
lighting products on your RGB
motherboard I'm gonna say the power at
once
we can expand up to five meters of RGB
strip which I don't know why you'd need
that much but there you have it and once
again we get a nice magnetic vacuum so
you can pretty much to get anywhere in
your case rounding things out here I got
to check out their halos Digital RGB fan
frame we're already familiar with the
other halo span frames that they
released last year those were really
cool allows you to pretty much take any
fan from any manufacturer and just slap
on an RGB fan frame to sort of customize
the look and feel of that fan with RGB
lighting and a really nice aesthetic on
this takes of a step further it's made
from a single piece of aluminum in the
sort of a very popular gray color that a
lot of their cases come in it looks
absolutely fantastic you can pretty much
take any fan and make it lit so to speak
there are 30 LEDs in the in the actual
housing itself and it can be daisy
chained with other digital RGB products
from fantex of course and you can also
sync it with pretty much any digital RGB
equipped fantex controller or
motherboard so clearly we have a lot of
cool stuff coming from fan text this
year at CES 2018 guys let me know what
you think of the new case and the power
supplies do you think they're cool
useful useless I don't know let me know
your thoughts in the comments below and
also feel free to tell me I like on the
