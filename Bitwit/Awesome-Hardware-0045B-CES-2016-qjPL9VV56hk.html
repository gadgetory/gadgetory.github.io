crew I got my wife my beautiful wife
Heather here she's actually helping me
shoot interviews during the during the
convention while we're on the show floor
really simple press record press record
again and then our buddy Joe who's here
editing frigging always telling her that
she has no excuse if she screws that
brand that's right this is consider this
a warning honey I'm still sleeping in
that room tonight yes I am okay couch
couch it is uh what's up rooster how's
it going coked-up canary everybody in
chat hello hello all of you I've been
drinking since around two o'clock you
have pm this this this afternoon but I'm
good I'm in good shape good i'm going to
be so ready for some bomb-ass dinner
wherever we go after this there's a lot
of good places to eat in Vegas or maybe
it's just because you're always drunk in
Vegas so everything tastes good i don't
know but i've had some pretty good food
here you have have you cool cell says he
loves your wife and agrees with her so
another i know i know that you and wifey
sauce are plotting some evil some evil
plan to kill me eventually i just know
you're gonna overthrow me any one of
these days so all right look why don't
we just get into our first segment which
is kind of a continuation to the partay
partay which is news we're talking about
tech news specifically news that's arise
or aroused during CES week which is this
week I'm always around this during CES
when absolutely I've never been harder
so the first story is from Nvidia
they've announced their self driving car
supercomputer in quotes it's kind of
debatable whether or not you want to
call it a supercomputer so if you might
remember from last year some of you
might recall the drive the drive CX that
nvidia unveiled now they have a follow
up to that which is called the dr px2
that's what they're calling it um that's
a that's different letters and numbers
of different letters numbers which
clearly means that it's better because
it came after the other one the
processing power is equivalent to a
hundred and fifty macbook pros let's
hope the price is an equivalent
15x Africa that would be be a pretty
cunning the gross domestic products of
at least if we chat developing countries
wit cha uh but but bear in mind 150
macbook pros the power of that tried to
release from your mind the fact that
it's an apple related metaphor I compact
that into the size of a lunch box now
they didn't say what kind of lunch box
they didn't specify whether it was like
one of those old-school traditional like
spider-man lunch boxes that was like you
know a little tin tin can or if it was
like a like a modern-day American kids
back like lunch box where it's like the
size of a freakin Navy SEALs you know
suitcase or something like that I don't
know if I'm saying but either way it's
small and it's powerful and it's it's
basically there to power autonomous
vehicles so what's the deal with that
there's what about the computer itself
it's got 12 cpu core supporting eight
teraflops and 24 deep learning terror
operations per second d sounds that
sounds fancy it sounds deep adding the
term deep learning to anything makes it
sound very like super intense deep
learning times a guy okay an online
course you'd find on pornhub challenge
for anyone in chat right now I want a
deep learning related pickup line what
do you think I like it there's gotta be
this it's in there somewhere yeah right
it's it's floating around I like to deep
learn about hip in my brain you've deep
learning about your vagina that's
specify yeah have I been thank you sir
to exhaust Oh have I been in you before
cuz you aced deep learning 101 I don't
know zoosk we're going to talk about
this kind of motion a little bit later
on oh it's just easier to take the cap
off why did I even have the I don't know
does it makes no sense so I like shut my
tooth about a year ago my back tooth and
it's just a little cavern now that
little like pieces of food and chips
could suck in so I always have to have a
toothpick to pick things out this weird
why don't you
get that fixed because I just got health
insurance this month oh yeah yeah well
now you get that fish I think you gotta
finish it hasn't been much time between
the beginning of the year and see yes so
that makes sense um that's right yeah so
what's up with this we were talking
about something we were talking about
this nvidia self-driving car
supercomputer Volvo is the company's
first partner to implement the pc into
their tests self-driving vehicles but
they're not the only ones they're also
working with nvidia is also working with
audi and who else BMW some other like
goddess mother are bucking that car
dudes that are well known who cares um
yeah and ford and for they're all using
the same lyrics a salir bien
billion gamely i don't know who dan
Blair is Chrysler Chrysler okay thank
you I'm gonna car guys so that explains
a lot I'm not either i think that's
correct but no you're probably been
better better guest in my mile deep I'll
leave learn my way into your pants now
that's good I like that I had Cooper
yeah so yeah self-driving who knows
if this is actually going to become
mainstream as far as like the nvidia
technology if that's going to be built
into the mainstream release of cars in
the near future but that's what they're
showing off at CES this week which sup
which makes a lot of sense if you're on
the if you're on the nvidia side of
things because you know self-driving
cars autonomous cars and just more
intelligent cars are I mean it's huge
it's it's it's a new market and it's a
type of thing where if Nvidia gets in on
this like the amount of money that you
pay for like upgrades and cars is
ridiculous yeah it's I have all right
two sides of this my wife just got a
2016 subaru outback and it's freaking
awesome I drove it out here to Vegas it
was like it the car practically drives
itself it has adaptive cruise control
right so as you put the cruise control
on and it will sense it has these things
called ice I up ahead of you which will
watch the road in front of you see if
there's another car there and then that
just your car at speed to match
okay um you also will do well like watch
the lanes and notify if you if you're
drifting out of the lanes right um but
it's just pretty cool I mean this is
automated stuff that the car does at the
same time when we were looking when
you're buying the car since its new like
the upgrade packages you do like if you
get to top to your car and you look at
the upgrade costs for other stuff that
you're buying on the car like here's the
second to top tier and all the upgrades
if you want to max up model costs three
thousand dollars for some reason if you
go to the top tier all of that same
package of the same features costs like
three grand more oh wow just because
you're going for the top tier male oh
you're the top to your model you can
afford must be willing to pay more money
for the same thing right anyway so my
point is if Nvidia can sort of set
themselves up as the de facto standard
for creating the sort of internal brains
for these self-driving vehicles then
they can make a lot of money oh yeah on
the hardware they produce absolutely
makes perfect sense for something like
CES 2016 yeah I'm sure there's gonna be
a ton of competition in this space as
well yes um but yeah I I just hope like
with a lot of things nvidia does I mean
no they they're not going to do I like
we want openness and nvidia is not
really the best at that so true um but
maybe that's not necessarily as big of
an issue when it comes to autonomous
vehicles as it is with like PC gaming
and things like that you know i mean if
you want the autonomous vehicle that
won't crash and kill you you gotta go
for the nvidia cuda power for having
like red paint hang outside of your car
something like that something like that
doesn't play nice with uh with red rims
um but yeah so that's something to keep
in mind that good good job in video for
breaking new ground next up we've got
the galaxy s7 from Samsung which
reportedly is bringing back the very
much missed micro SD card slot yay and
water resistance so they've already
announced this is already official that
the the new galaxy s6 is going to
support a 2560 x 1440 super amoled
screen on both of its too
it's offering the 5.1 inch display and
the 5.7 inch model as well the 5.7 inch
being the edge so it's going to have
that the kind of curved edges where you
can like interact with them and stuff
like that also bigger batteries all
around for both of these predators over
the predecessors 3,000 milliamp battery
for the 5.1 inch and a 3600 milliamp
battery for the edge the larger screen
but most importantly here there is there
there are strong rumors I don't want to
say they're confirmed but they're strong
rumors that Samsung's bringing back the
micro SD card slot because that was one
of the huge upsets I think for the
galaxy s6 was that you had this really
slim body and it looked a little bit
like the iphone 6 but people were
willing to forgive it except that it
didn't that it now omitted a micro SD
card slot and that was one thing that
samsung galaxy phones were always known
for as far as having an advantage over
iPhones was was that expandable storage
option and it was a huge upset when the
galaxy s6 came out and they're like yeah
it's gonna be like kind of a unibody
type thing no expandable storage what
you see is what you get but according to
rumors and this is on valid different
websites and stuff that I've seen the
micro SD card slot might be coming back
with capacities up to 200 gigs which is
definitely enough elbow room for for
whatever you might need to store on
there also both models will reportedly
be water resistant up to one meter so
splashing dropping in the toilet things
like that if you're if you're so bold to
retrieve it after it's dropped on the
toilet of course will be added to this
new line of galaxy phones which is cool
the full unveiling of the s7 if you're
curious is more than a month away still
so we still have to wait till then to
confirm if these rumors are true vote
yeah that I'm glad about that like the
s5 was the one that really I feel like
kind of took off yeah and you know
Samsung is really kind of handing it to
apple as far as the Bryan smartphone
market but right I felt like all the
stuff that they did to make the s5 more
unique and more useful in a lot of ways
then you know some of the stuff that the
iphone didn't have
and then with s6 like they went more
like let's make it more like iphone yeah
um so yeah that's that's cool i like i
like microsd expansion slots it's one of
the things c2 I wish my nexus 6 head
yeah all right next up we've got the
oculus rift and hey oculus has just
announced that the other they're really
wildly popular and buzz-worthy headset
display can now be pre-ordered now I
shouldn't say now but can be pre-ordered
starting tomorrow yes 8 am-8 a.m.
pacific time that's 4 p.m. gmt which is
Greenwich Greenwich Greenwich Greenwich
mom we're gonna change from tamale
Greenwich masturbation time ganesh
master finish meantime masturbation so
that stands for television okay yes ah
so this is cool if you've been long
awaiting this this headset displayed to
launch now's your chance to preorder it
you will get 2 free games with this
pre-order which include what is include
oh lucky tales by playful and Eve
Valkyrie by CCP I don't know anything
about lucky tales but a Valkyrie seems
to be it has an element of hype to it
I'm fun have you tried it no I haven't
you didn't try it what would I have
tried it I didn't try it computech alien
good i think itís objects stop rubbing
it in my face I call X prime I didn't go
to bags my meal are Irish pub Paxman
guys dupid yeah I don't know if they had
this demo last year it it looks like a
fun game it's it's a lot of fun to play
it's like of all like of all the BR
demos and stuff like that that I have
done there's two I feel like I Spit a
little bit myself there's two that I
feel like I've really been like I'm
playing a game like some of these arm
like this is a VR demo meant to
demonstrate some of the capabilities of
virtual reality that virtual reality
headset there's nothing been talked to
that I jumped into and I was like I'm
playing a game and I was just like
having fun playing it right one was a
Valkyrie um which is just great because
you can like look around and it's a dog
fighting game and Max it's it's fun play
and then the second one was that it's
like the tron disk throwing game okay
I'm he do all right that was at computex
my son and that was just I mean that was
really cool actually you should try that
if you ever that sounds pretty sweet
because you're actually doing the
movements and stuff is yeah cuz you
you're playing against somebody else
right you're just in a big room it
really I feel like it uses like your
body and it's it's the one where you
have the connects watching you so it
seemed okay right everything right and
then it's completely three-dimensional
so you can see Ronnie and everything so
you throw these disks up and then since
you're in a kind of a big long rectangle
room they bounce off the walls oh that's
cool so that's so like the your opponent
give you a pond yeah your opponent could
send one that bounces here bounces here
and then hits you in the back or
something like nice and then you have
one hand that can throw the disks in one
hand with a shield that you can use to
hit the disks okay I can just block it
or you can do a motion to hit the disk
and it bounces it back at the person oh
nice and it's just it was freaking fun
like I play dating it's Kane I didn't
know it's playing against Kane it's time
so it's like old-school pong meets
modern air hockey in virtual reality and
3d instead of 10 3d yeah yeah but it's
really cool um next yet hopefully i
think i think i'm gonna be able to go to
computex this year so maybe maybe i'll
get some cool demos maybe maybe at CES
this year this week um like comfy text
but yeah I was Rachel too oh cool yeah
absolutely absolutely got a pair visit
um so yeah if you're gonna preorder this
do it tomorrow morning at eight a.m.
pacific time otherwise it's gonna launch
hey Nana I might where are you oh I
probably have to I don't want to get up
at 8am yeah I kind of have to I kind of
have to be up at like 7am to get ready
and so I might I might just dive me
tomorrow beggin ya tomorrow I think my
first thing tomorrow is like 11 son of a
bitch i hate you i hate you already so
the the the headset will launch in q1 of
this year and will cost roundabout
of three hundred dollars USD but that's
not confirmed oculus made a point to
leave that out specifically when they
announced the pre-order so we're just
we're not going to know until tomorrow
at 8am how much it actually costs but
very exciting than less let's move on to
corsair we were briefly talking about
them real quick before we jump into that
yep answering a couple questions on the
stream computex is it always at the
beginning of June in my experience yes
and a couple people were saying that the
YouTube stream is that we're not
streaming to YouTube right now right
since we're at an Airbnb in Las Vegas
youtube we jet we tried dual streaming
on my half of the stream I need to stop
spitting things all right we tried dual
stream on might have a stream and it was
it was eating up too much bandwidth and
everything was just getting choppy so
we're only streaming to twitch I did a
speed test and it was 11 down one up
yeah that's pretty bad yeah yeah well
that makes sense then yep okay sorry um
corsair stuff course a oh so they have
their spec alpha which we talked about a
very very kind of flashy case which I'm
not a huge fan of but it is only eighty
dollars and it's full ATX you do get
like tie-down points behind the
motherboard tray get rubber grommets and
you can kind of get a premium look and
feel I guess in terms of like how how
aggressive the design is if you're into
that sort of thing but what really
caught my eye here I'm not going to
focus too much on the spec alpha was the
400 °c and 400 q these are part of the
carbide series these are a bit more a
lot more minimalistic this is kind of
more my style and this also strikes me
because of the price point a hundred
dollars strikes me more of as of a
competitor to the h 4 40 from NZXT
liston or the define ass or the define
us both of them I mean the aesthetically
it looks more like the H 442 me but
they're all three cases are priced
around that hundred dollar price point
and I think it's it's a nice-looking
case I really like the side panel window
they kind of emulate the the 600 see
which is the recent one which is
inverted it's like a that's a flipped
motherboard and stuff this is actually
right side up so this is like a 600 see
that's right side up you still get that
really nice side panel window granted
the 400 °c afforded QR slightly
different
fact that one of them has the side panel
window that we just saw and another one
has the solid side panel which is also
lined with Santa dampening material on
all sides of the case so it's really
built for silence yes I owens vs show
off i think that q is for quiet or why
you have a sheriff II right exactly so
this also just like the the spec alpha
cases omits the five and a quarter inch
base so that kind of leaves more room at
the front for front intake so you get
more air flow to your GPU and your CPU
which is also nice you also have a lot
more radiator support here than you do
on the spec alpha including a 360
millimeter raid at the right of the
front 240 at the top 120 at the meet at
the rear pretty pretty decent radiator
support for a hundred older case again
that that also strikes me as being a
really strong define our five competitor
because it's got all those radiator
support supporting mounts also the PSU
is the bottom as well as the drives you
can't really see them because they're
kind of enclosed in this this case this
casing at that kind of separates the
lower compartment from the upper
compartment and since I have visited
corsair I can tell you guys this little
extra bit of info would you tell us tell
us this psu cover at the bottom is
actually in two sections yeah it looks
like it yeah you can remove this right
side if you want to or you can remove
this left side you can do the whole
thing one or you can do what are the
other okay so if you want to show your
power supply you can or if you want to
do more storage or other stuff over here
or just give a little bit more airflow
rather than having that sort of stealth
cover up you can do that right very nice
so uh good stuff to look forward to from
corsair I like it so far um let's move
one other or our last story of CES which
is a bit of a that's a bit of a
curveball that I threw in here but there
are there is one vendor at CES this year
that is demonstrating their sex toy this
is the only a vibrator company at CES
yes I have three meetings scheduled with
them yeah the next three that's pretty
much all the CES coverage i'll be
pumping up the school
that is at this booth so Brian and
Sookie Dunham have brought their sex toy
company ohmibod to CES they actually
brought it to CS 6 years ago and a lot
of the attendees were kind of like
giving them like the double look like
are you at the right convention because
you know the adult entertainment expo
happens pretty much a week after CES or
like the week the weekend after CES on
just a day or two I'll use these beliefs
at the same time right so there's a lot
of crossover there but while CES does
try to distance itself from from
advertising sex tech this company has
somehow managed to find a spot at the
convention as as as we start to see like
all aspects of human health become more
s'more mainstream as far as like
tracking I mean like the explosion of
like fitness trackers recently I think
that's also helped to make this
something that's more acceptable II
received at CES where it's like well
we're tracking our steps we're tracking
the calories we count we're tracking our
sleep why not track our G fabs per
minute you know this is so that's what
this does it does it absolutely Paul
absolutely what can a smart dildo do for
me Kyle so this is that's what I kiss is
not just any smart dildo fall and you
would be enlightened to hear and learn
that this bluetooth-enabled smart kegel
exerciser which features vibration
feedback has a voice guided training app
that helps women to strengthen their
pelvic floor muscles so what kind of aid
does this actually provide for a woman
well then what are the voice activations
I you should be able to select like
manly man harder harder faster deeper it
just sounds like a daft punk song harder
better faster stronger ok now go slow
now goes fell harder better they could
get the guy I could get the guy who does
the rocket videos to do it oh yeah yeah
but look at tile rocket tired the most
epic Mouse everand defended
you want your dildo to go faster well
the last time you worked out that wrist
okay so what is what kind of aid does is
provide women well it helps this is this
is all science folks this is all science
it helps women in whose the pelvic floor
has has been weakened due to childbirth
or older age also better orgasm and hit
a weak pelvic floor also better or guess
what is which I think that's probably
why most people would use it here I
pulled up this image here from the story
and I'm very flow control curious about
the different settings that I'm seeing
listed in this image we have first timer
first time or a self-explanatory sexy
trainer ooh that's promiscuous here's
where it gets confusing a mom-to-be new
mom right because my flow control and
virtuoso but okay Heather's looking up
does any of this make sense to you okay
you want stronger muscles before you
give birth I make sense so that would be
the mom to beast profile eyes okay and
or if you or if you just gave birth your
your flap your flapping everywhere dash
it's all sorts of and so you're a new
mom who's trying to now tightened
tightening okay all right agent is back
that's the action ah and then flow
control no clue not a
clue so that really ok wow I'm glad
another woman all these problems I don't
have to deal with you've never paid from
laughing to her I not enough for a
company to like make a fleshlight for me
to like control it I'm sure there's a
huge market for that but maybe maybe
there is I'm not part of that
demographic but if we but the old form
that if we did have any female viewers
that they are gone now something about a
Titan acts as well this is powered by
tighten its power fight
I'm totally going to that booth so so
haven't even gone to the best part here
okay the app program there's different
programs in the app that leads users
through the exercises and score them on
different categories such as the number
of reps and strength so you actually get
rated on like the number of G faps that
you that you pull off literally quite
literally with this device he gets
better it gets better Paul the app sets
daily goals for users and once they hit
certain levels of their reps or strength
goals and different pleasure pattern
vibrations are unlocked as an incentive
so basically achievement uncocked is
what I'm seeing here that's a good what
we have here this Chi Minh uncocked
everybody here entire urine this entire
segment was leading up to you it'd be
able to say that Albin one big fat punch
line got cut and it was so uh but hey
you know honey nice miss 2017 or 2016 if
you if you want a cankle smart kegel
exerciser I'm I support it because
because I care about your health and
your I was sleeping on the couch tonight
you're right I'm cool with that Cal has
been noticing this earth what is it
weekend floor the basement what the hell
is this thing to do again why I know
this is it helps Kegel it's a Kegel a
smart keggle instant exerciser the
pelvic floor yes teleflora yes all
you're trying to do is encourage Heather
to have a stronger pelvic floor don't
you care are you have a husband who
cares about your pelvic floor being
strong what else does a wife asked for
only these days I'm upset that this
technology is only available for four
women right where's the where's the
smart fleshlight I mean okay women
and I suppose if you're a guy you could
use this to but not all guys are into
that so we need like a power glove power
law same technology sensors on it so we
can tell you know how effective your
being and perhaps give you some kind of
reward for an increasing year and your
gfs yeah and the power glove has
built-in sensors that communicate with
the the smart dildo Joe and I were
actually talking about this on the way
here to see us believe it or not
teledildonics is a thing oh yeah
teledildonics and discuss this on the
show breitler these are like smart sex
toys that actually communicate to each
other over the web so regardless of
where you are there could be a guy with
a fleshlight that has sensors in it and
a girl with a dildo that has sensors on
it and when one person touches or
sensitizes the sensors of one sex toy
the other reacts on the other side of
the world so you can literally feel the
sensations but between you know yourself
and your partner teledildonics it is a
thing I've done extensive research was
the old AT&amp;amp;T it's an 80s yeah
catchphrase how does it reach out and
touch someone reach out and touch them
or something like that it's a subliminal
they should motioning they should
repurpose that for that that's right
okay so uh good stuff why don't we move
on to pin my pc is kid stuff ah yes this
is gonna be the last segment guys can my
pc pi i wrap it up with some pin my pc
you guys send in your pitches we wait
your rigs we already did Q&amp;amp;A on paul's
half of the show so we're gonna get
right into this segment let's go ahead
and start off with hugs a lot which has
a very interesting as approved by kyle
is this this is i didn't do any kind of
key way for my half of the show what the
 is that it's like a 3d I don't know
we'll just zoom in Jesus Christ that
censored properly now you cover up the
worst part okay hustla I 738 20 okay
4.32 at
point three gigahertz Tanner Max and
enter max cooler to Selena dress 29 80s
The Fighter 5 p9x79 so this is actually
a a x79 well it suits 3820 so yeah right
rice and and 8 x 4 gigs of ddr3 1600
still a very formidable system despite
being two generations old as far as the
CPU goes your GPUs are looking pretty
solid man I really like the dual gtx 980
s um what is that oath so that is a hot
swap try of a at the front right he is
added to his define our five I like it I
like the the added functionality there I
know one thing that first sticks out to
me is that USB 3 pass through that you
have sticking out the back oh it's
because it's next 79 motherboard yeah
there are no doesn't have a USB there
are no x79 motherboards to my knowledge
that have a USB 3.0 header right so this
is a solution for that right to bring a
couple of the USB 3.0 ports that were
added by add-on chips and bad ball down
yeah and while while that probably is
necessary I would still try to route it
may be underneath your video cards if
possible because it looks really sloppy
on top of your video cards it kind of
detracts from that beautiful pair of
nikes that you have I also really great
coolers and it kind of just I forgive me
out of it I forget if the art 5 has any
of those routing grommet things up at
the top it does but yeah just if you can
take this cable and bring it across the
top hide it behind the rat or something
like that yeah um that yeah that would
be greatly preferable I think that would
yet no would ya especially since it's so
visible through the side window right
also the the ketchup and mustard cables
coming off the five and a quarter inch
bays I think those could be a bit more
neutralized if you had some black cables
I don't know if you wanna get some
extensions but it's you have a nice
thing going with the black and blue and
I would hate
see I get ruined by like ugly yellow and
red cables yeah some extensions are for
sleeping or something like that might
help you also have some can emit there's
this blue LED fan here at the bottom
front which I I understand it's blue
LEDs and you've got a blue and black
theme going on here but I don't think
it's adding a whole lot since it's
different from the other fan that's
right there next to right right um yeah
i would i would either want all LED fans
are all the same black and white fans I
agree yes anyway though thanks for
sending that and hugs a lot thank you
sir next up we've gone to recon 801 okay
now I he sends in his built his first
build very first build and the power
supplies sticker in him he has removed
at the power supply sticker good we are
in for him it's like a pro tip after he
took these pictures okay I so green LEDs
uh it looks like this is a wait is this
an r5 know what is this is a coarser
case just of Corsair you got 7 15 de or
so no no it's not something big d it's
definitely course sure but it's yeah
it's one of me you one of course there's
budget line I forget I can't tell by
looking up it oh wait here is um oh oh
oh no that's a shoot I should know what
that comes our series is it and I don't
know the model is it okay for 400 are
300 oh I don't know yeah at any rate
it's a good case its profit DD I know
this case it's got good cable management
which you kind of have a grasp of your
ATX in your pcie and your CPU all the
main components motherboard GPU cpu are
well taken care of with those green
sleep cables which look beautiful on
that that msi car that you have good
matching those are from cable mod cable
mod well done but as far as like the
other like front panel connectors at
least on the bottom of your motherboard
I feel like those are a bit kind of
disarrayed and I think yeah just a
couple twist ties or zip ties really if
you just did it every few inches you put
a zip tie around all those and you just
bunch them all together so you have
seamless like a thicker cable it should
almost look like a thick one thick cable
running from the bottom of your
motherboard to that drama that you have
by the power supply I think that's going
to clean it up a lot in addition to that
also stables it's a 450d 450d thank you
Paul Thank You Chet Thank You Chet and
also some of the cables coming from your
fans your front fans that are crossing
over it just looks really it's very
obvious that there's cables crossing
over there as well letting them down
behind the hard drive cage the awesome
phenom green cables in here I feel that
could use just a bit of tidying up from
the front fans here some of these little
black cables yeah especially your front
panels right down here at the bottom and
then your rear exhaust here on the upper
left you have the cable running all the
way down to the bottom here which might
be a limitation on what what fan headers
you have on this board this is an x 99
msi board but i would definitely try to
try to free something up up up here at
the top I feel like you should have
something else yeah aside from your cpu
fan header up here and i'll be a much
better place to plug that one and if i
know you can biting an extension for
dirt cheap yeah yeah oh yeah definitely
450d thank you recon 801 appreciate that
buddy next up we've got Flavio Flavio
Flavio I wish I had a cool name like
Flavio he also has a special thumb here
just for his kind you know look at this
phantom 5 30 from NZXT and I 747 1997
gaming 7 motherboard 16 gigs of memory
and even a 770 so slightly auto graphics
card supernova Supan supernova EVGA 800
watt power supply 128 gig SSD a couple
one terabyte hard drives time for 212
evo sickle flow cooler master fans a
couple more fans a couple more fans
first off beautiful picture yeah I
almost picked this this entry just
because I wanted to show off what a good
pin my pc entry should look like every
time he this this visit this picture has
been post-production yeah absolutely I
don't mean he like Photoshop stuff into
it I just mean he took this picture I
can
I can just ring the whiting yeah I don't
think he changed much I can just tell
this has been sharpened a little bit
this is right maybe some concert
saturation yeah yeah it is but that's
why it looks so nice yeah so anyway good
job though so I that is the new standard
for Pitt my pc entries now everywhere
guys but just just it's super clear I
can see everything it's beautifully
framed so first off you have a good
system here 770 older card but still
very capable I know a lot of people some
some friends of mine are still rocking
750 TI's and that's doing the job just
fine what I would say is if you are
trying to go with a cohesive color
scheme then first off I would remove the
orange power supply sticker because
that's not doing anyone any favors
that's not really going to match with
anything get some sleeved extensions for
that power supply that are probably
either black or red usually it all goes
back to the motherboard whatever colors
color the motherboard heat sinks are is
usually the color that I would determine
the whole system to be yes um so I would
go a thread and and you could do red and
gold here you could go to cable mod and
get some red and gold sleep cables that
would look pretty freaking sick with
that 770 and your motherboard slave your
pcie your ATX your CPU if you want it's
not too big of a deal because it's kind
of up there tucked away but I like how
you've removed the hard drive cage at
the bottom of the case to open up air
flow from that front intake going to
your graphics card I don't really mind
the two fans at the bottom but they are
blue and I feel like that clashes a
little bit you've also got to blue LED
fans at the top I don't know if you want
to replace all those with just something
more color neutral I think you know you
know what I always think this is like a
go to rule of mine and this is a
personal preference whatever the the
rear exhaust fan is is how all the other
fans in the case should look for the
most part the general rule there are
exceptions but if you have a black frame
in your rear exhaust with a white blade
I like to see like my eyes are just they
orgasm anytime I see like all the other
fans in the case have the exact same
look
in the most visible fan right through
the side panel yeah so that's that's
kind of a rule of thumb just for me but
that's how I would pimp it out
personally I completely agree with all
of Kyle's suggestions I have one more to
add and it's really really easy and
something I've definitely overlooked
myself in the past you see this yellow
sticker with the don't throw this thing
away where's your mouse oh yes yes yes
yes that sticker is there legally
because the company that sells that
product has to put it on there you do
not have to keep it on there as a
consumer an end user and in fact I would
almost guarantee that that sticker is
notched on one side so you can just grab
it and go and pop it right off and it'll
rip itself and everything so yeah pull
up pull that off absolutely okay thank
you very much Flavio Thank You Fabio
next up we've got Elsie leo is the goat
Leo is the good he's gotten 50t a bigger
the devil we got a 750 ti in here at
eight sixty k yeah that's a good cpu a
good budget cpu pick one over 70 80
bucks yeah of course but it still did my
console killer was built with doesn't
you I'm sorry I mean totally Bob I was
thinking it was a 8350i 11 Oh 56 okay
gotcha I'm pretty sandybridge gun Joe
sorry uh mm tht source 210 very nice
budget case there so this is a budget
system for sure but it looks really good
this looks better it looks what more
well placed and well built then a lot of
high-end systems that I've seen in pin
my pc the cable management actually
isn't too terrible considering the case
where you're kind of limited on grommets
and routing holes that you have but
you've still done a pretty good job at
tucking most of them away I feel like
you could tighten it up a bit at least
with the the hard drive cable the SATA
cable there you can maybe tuck a little
bit more of that behind the motherboard
tray with that routing hole by the power
supply apart from that I mean that with
a budget case I really feel like there's
no need to upgrade to like sleeve cables
because you're probably going to spend
more on that then then your actual CPU
if you really add up all the different
cables yeah so I wouldn't
recommend that but the great thing about
budget systems like this is that there's
always an upgrade path so there's always
like what's what are those next few
steps that you know as you're saving
your money over the next few weeks or
months what do you want to upgrade first
the first thing I would upgrade coming
from being an AMD user myself with a lot
of the builds that I've put together the
AMD stock coolers are not that great yep
and they're a lot noisier actually than
the intel stock coolers which i hate
them for so i would probably replace
that first i don't know if that's doc it
looks kind of stuff but it looks kind of
like it might be aftermarket all the
same that's stuck i'm pretty sure okay
so i would probably replace that first
and foremost the second thing that would
do is add an SSD into the mix you can
get 128 gig SSD for dirt cheap these
days prices are lowering bite by the
week it can get a 240 or 256 for like
yes 70 bucks absolutely so that's
another really really easy upgrade to
make just go ahead and clone your your
OS and put the image onto the new SSD
you're good to go it's going to improve
things immensely and rip off that damn
power supply sticker your power supply
sticker or just swap out the power
supply oh that's that's another I mean
that's not a terrible power supply by
any stretch from thermaltake but it's
definitely not the best it's an older
one you can tell because it doesn't have
any plus logo on it right um but cell
mentioned this and I cannot thought the
same thing it is a mini ITX motherboard
and a full-size ATX case which looks a
little yes a little more efficient but
like house--it that gives you the
upgrade path so if you did want to jump
up from fm2 to something more
substantial whether it's an intel
platform or hopefully amd's new platform
and for stuff coming out later this year
yeah you do have that you know I have a
term for that Paul it's mobo dwarfism
mobo Dorf ism yeah has been it's been
experienced now it's okay uh thank you
for that Elsie next up we have a lot of
what you have you picked a lot of these
guys we've got yep three more of them
anymore okay so we've got dune gate
doing gate doom gate gate shunderson
white black and blue bills you've got a
6600 k so you're rocking crunching sky
lakes new a Suzy 170 AR good motherboard
16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance
X this is a pretty high in system asus
gtx 960 ok mid-range but still good
orion triton 24 240v SSD no experience
with that WD caviar blue one terabyte
solid w cooler master hyper 212 evo
awesome thermaltake commander msi snow
edition EVGA supernova NEX 750 watt
power supply pretty good range of
components all around I have to say just
from the external look yeah it's because
this is a very small side panel window
but this looks pretty badass I mean yeah
just cuz you have just kind of the the
bling year part of the of the graphics
graphics card sticking out there and
even though this isn't a 4 to 12 right
yes even though it's a hyper 212 just
since its kind of that little bit of it
peeking out what's nice this looks
pretty cool so uh hey thermaltake i
sometimes revealing less is more yeah
yeah cuz I'll be honest once you pull up
this fold fish a look at the inside of
it it's not terrible but if there's
definitely this this whole area and the
lower right quadrant is is pretty messy
room for mom yeah so you could you could
rear out some of these cables I don't
know that there's anything you can do to
your front panel connectors outside of
spray painting them or sleeping them or
something like that but those are stand
out to me but again I mean you have such
a small side panel windows a lot of this
stuff isn't really very visible right I
would want to clean this this cable mess
up here down in the bottom in front yeah
just because that would provide a little
bit more fresh air flow from your front
intake fans towards the back yeah um
yeah katal any any other suggestions um
you have you honestly have some pretty
decent hardware in here I mean you've
got a really nice core i5 skylake gtx
960 i almost feel like those are
deserving of a better case and I not to
knock your case or anything but they're
like I can tell that it's a budget case
because there's no like rubber grommets
they're just cut outs things like that
bad that really like actually clean up
your system a lot the fact they're not
just like big cut outs with like this
because you have the white side panel on
the back you can kind of see where the
cables are rabid once they go into the
cutouts a rubber grommet come takes care
of that sort of thing but let's let's
assume because this is a new build it's
a 6600 k this has to have been put
together in the past month or two you
monts yeah I had to figure that this
case was reused maybe my memories but I
mean he chose this case if you bought if
this is a new case like you know maybe
he really likes a look of it there man
maybe and I agree it's it's it's more
budget since you don't have the grommets
and everything but yeah I think it's
functional like you you have everything
you need and it is functional but yeah I
mean maybe that would be my one critique
is like I probably wouldn't have chose
the same case you did yeah I mean and
it's it's not just form like the fact
that you that you have like you don't
have removable drive cages kind of
limits a bit of your air flow like and
you've got a case that was a little bit
more just a tiny bit more high-end you
could probably pull those out and you
only have it looks like two maybe three
drives at the most there you can
probably pull out one of those hard
drive cages if you did have one of those
higher end cases and open up a bit more
air flow for your video card especially
because that's a blower style fan cooler
on that Asus card so having some fresh
and take their would probably do you
some good random to convey functional to
contradict what I said earlier this
drive cage mounting the solution right
here is pretty bad um because you have
to mount them all front to back and you
have to get in there one last thing
they'll pull this pulled us some plastic
SLI grommet off of your card good call I
don't mind those leaving them on but
when they're this light blue color that
light blue plastic cover which I've seen
a lot of right I think they look bad
right okay thanks on that I know next up
we have basic steam 7 gaming Jim Jim
guru he says help need less cables so
this was a bit of a hot mess oh wow um
yeah there's there's a lot of cabling
there's a lot of chaos here looks like
you're in a decent case it's action shot
here he took this he took this picture
while he was tumbling out of a moving
vehicle looks like Armageddon was
happening in this moment and as a fire
there's the
this little buster seriously like it
might be bursting in cable manager you
can save your life oh my god yeah I
don't know what's happening here but God
help you I what do we what do we where
do we begin which power supplies this it
looks awful it's probably like a it's
not a it's a power supply with a side
panel window on a philippine sea turtles
oh the caddy good lives I can't be good
I've seen this power supply before
replace it but I have no idea what it is
is it a king win oh no is it a not a
king one that's really where b2 is it
authorities roseville might have they
they're definitely they're guilty of
they guarding our so they were guilty of
two other lightning series oh my god oh
is it the one where the cables light up
or is that a different one the rosewill
lightning series is fully modular uh-huh
every single module or people are gonna
LED and it yes that was my my plugs are
clearly it is awful Oh thinking and
Charlie was a pretty decent man is so
ugly I have no idea what power supply
this is oh Christ but yeah you you just
need a new power supply I yes that's
really all there is to it here I can
tell this one's not that great I wish we
had some better pictures to see what
model it was or anything like that via
this is just a get a new power supply
get something that's fully modular get
get something get one of the newer ones
it has all like all black cables even if
they're not sleeved it's just plastic
all black that's fine yeah that would
look so much better that would that
would clean up so much this met the
cable mess in here the colors you have
from some of these cables that your
routing up to different places um yeah
that's it just a new power supply yeah
and also the case that you're building
and doesn't even look like it natively
supports a 240 millimeter radiator one
that you have in there where is that oh
wait it's going oh that's at the front
yeah oh but I'm just saying it looks
like a really budget case that wouldn't
natively support that kind of
so I don't know if it's maybe time for a
case upgrade as well if you're gonna
upgrade your power supply which means
you have to take apart quite a few
things might want to consider a case
upgrade to ya it also looks kind of
cramped like the hoses oh yeah your tan
looks a bit stream there but just a
thought it's a weird weird entry yeah
but thanks for sending less functional
ok thank you basic stream 7 and we've
got our last entry for pin my pc before
we close up this episode of awesome
hardware it is from Evan he's rocking in
h 4 40 beautiful n ZX TK score i 747 IDK
devil's canyon very nice 16 gigs of ddr3
1866 speed gtx 970 super super clock
must be me BGA though asus mark s
reckoned that nasa Bronco mad about RM
850 850 pro 256 gig SSD WD blue one
terabyte and NZXT q+ yes i like the NZXT
NZXT q+ in there that also makes it look
really nice this is a beautiful system
honestly look when I saw this I almost
didn't pick it because it's almost
flawless did you add this as a palate
cleanser after the last system yes I did
I needed something to exactly why is the
palette refresh refresh us and keep us
in the game because this is a really
nice build all around i don't have much
to critique here the only thing I could
say is maybe get some blacks leg
extensions because the flat ribbon
cables while they are black and they do
match the glossiness kind of is
distracting you see a lot of light
reflection off of them especially with
the white LEDs that you have from the
NZXT q yeah they kind of reflected a
little bit and they stand out the the
fabric just black sleeve extensions
either from silverstone bitfenix
wherever you want to go from cable mod i
think would look a lot better a lot
cleaner it would it would elevate it it
would elevate it for sure and the only
other thing that I can see sticking out
here is that sound car that you have
there I believe that's a creative sound
card that's what I was gonna say okay
what is reducing on the fourth it's a
sound core 3d sound card right rative
yeah what would you have him do about
that well I would say just honestly get
rid of it
destroy um oh no oh no oh no we're gonna
have to ask for something someone else
too we can't second answer the door mom
uh to ask if it's paid its knowledge
rejected if you didn't order it okay uh
creative yes you distracted me sorry ha
no way we're supposed to keep talking so
no nosy that's you're right you're right
nothing's okay at the front door um the
yeah this is sound the sound card is uh
it's it's not bad but given how clean
your system looks and that that is
mainly the only red standing out except
for that little LED um maybe swapping it
for an external deck would be yeah
something you might be a USB DAC yeah
because a USB DAC an external thing
those those can have really good sound
those can have some extra benefits on
top of just what a sound card is right
in and of itself yes and then it might
be a good way of kind of you know
keeping the internals of your system
with with your main color scheme true
but I don't think it looks terrible no
no it doesn't that is at all yeah but um
yeah that and then like I said this is
definitely a system that would would be
elevated a little bit by some sleep
extensions or something like that you
could you could also spray paint that
red heat sink black yeah quite easily be
an option to it's probably easy to mask
off so I would say definitely get rid of
it if it weren't for that red LED sits
there too because we owe the LEDs there
and you can't do anything about it true
then I don't know if I'm that tough
series sir Bronco motherboard I don't
know if you can disable the LED or not
sure I don't if they have dark mode
that's what feature of EVGA motherboards
that yes I've seen here and there dark
but I like dark mode sound so cool but
that's pretty much gonna wrap it up for
pin my pc and this episode of awesome
