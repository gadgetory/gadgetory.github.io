channel so we're doing something a
little quirky a little fun a little
different today and that is we're doing
a weight loss VR challenge to see if
yours truly can lose any weight at all
from playing VR over the course of the
next 30 days and the reason for this is
not because I feel like I need to lose
weight I feel like I could stand to lose
some lbs don't get me wrong I'm not the
thinnest guy in the park that's a phrase
somewhere but I mean I wanted to do this
idea for a long time I thought it'd be
really interesting to see if you could
replace a traditional workout routine
with virtual reality because if you can
that's great because we are super fun
and go to the gym sucks I mean I'd
rather get kicked in the balls three
times a day then go to the gym is
horrible so I think this will be a cool
experiment and for all of you health
nuts out there all you fitness gurus I'm
sure you're probably cringing right now
Gong Kyle this is not a practical or
proper workout method because you should
be lifting weights and building muscle
if you really want to lose weight
properly and I understand I get I'm not
claiming to be a fitness guru myself nor
am i claiming this methodology of
workout to be practical or even
beneficial to you all I'm curious to
know is if you can lose weight through
this super unorthodox method so try not
to take it too seriously I'm certainly
not but the other thing that I will say
that I'm going to try to do is watch
what I eat a little bit more for this
next thirty days because I think that
would give this experiment a fighting
chance like it's gonna be bad if I'm
just eating cake for every meal but I'm
not going to be implementing a fad diet
at the same time I'm gonna be cutting
out all all carbs I might just be
refraining from having that third cookie
as a buffet line if that makes sense so
yeah I think nutrition and diet is as
important is an important factor to
losing weight even if you are exercising
now I did give some consideration as to
what gains I'd actually be playing for
this challenge and what I settled on was
just a single title in that title being
hollow point this is an indie game that
it's an archery for those of you who are
unaware and Joe Durbin of upload Viacom
actually did a test who he tested about
a dozen or so VR games to see which ones
would be the best at burning calories
and he found hollow point to be one of
the highest ranking
I'm actually burning anywhere from seven
to eight hundred calories per hour it's
a metric F ton of calories to be burned
from playing a video game nonetheless so
that's what we're going to be settling
on today as far as frequency and
duration I'm going to be doing hour-long
sessions so 60 minutes per session in VR
playing hollow point four four times a
week at least four times a week I'm
setting a minimum for myself with no
maximum cap I mean I could do five days
a week if I wanted to or more but four
days a week for an hour a day is the
absolute minimum for the next 30-day
term now as I go about jumping around
looking like an idiot and VR I will be
tracking some of the metrics there so I
did pick up this Fitness band from
Garmin it's the vivosmart HR plus it's
actually one of the more highly reviewed
fitness bands that I could find online
and it seems to track most of the things
I need it for including heart rates
steps calories intensity minutes held
that can't wait to find out what
intensity minutes are but anyway I'll
put a link to this in the description
below for those of you interested seems
to be pretty good I already like sort of
how it how it looks and feels on how the
how it charges and things like that but
I'm going to be putting it on for the
first time today when we kick off
hollow-point day one and I think we're
actually ready to do that now let's go
ahead and strap in - no wait so in order
to find out how much weight I've lost by
the end of this term first one needs to
know how much weight one waves so to the
scale we go alright so there she is been
a while it's been a while scale you look
a little dusty there apparently I've
been machined to use you lately
now before I step on this scale I want
to quickly document exactly what I'm
wearing so I know what to wear when I
weigh myself again thirty days from now
so I've got my my faded black jeans here
ok nothing in my pockets nothing wallet
no phone no no nothing I've got a no
belt either so if that's my underwear
don't look at that I've got the Paul
Hardware shirt on
ok good quality that's very light and
I've actually got my lavalier
transmitter off to the side here so I'm
not weighing now because it does weigh
something so I'm not wearing that just
just actual microphone itself and of
course I'm carrying the camera I will be
carrying the camera
on day 30 as well so here we go stepping
on the scale Joe stand up straight
164 no I can't read 167 point 4 don't
look at my feet
Peter weird so that's that's how much
their way and I'm going to try to shed
as much off of that number as I possibly
can in the next month or so in the next
four weeks so ladies and gentlemen I
think we are at that point where I can
finally strap in to a VR headset and
play some damn video games and hopefully
become less fat let's do that
all right so that was a lot of fun
actually and equally exhausting I know
you can't tell right now because I'm all
showered and changed and stuff but I was
sweating a great deal after that hour
guys I mean my legs were burning even
just like 30 minutes in which is also a
huge reminder that I'm severely out of
shape but hopefully it gets better and
gets easier as I do this more regularly
hopefully by the end of the 30 day
period I will feel a bit more strong and
not Peter out so quickly but I did do
the full hour so congrats to me you can
hold your applause till the end I know
but yeah it was pretty cool I definitely
feel like I got a good workout I think
is the important thing that being said
there were a couple snags and issues
along the way just you know nature of
the vr platform that sort of held back
the overall experience the first one
being the obvious record coming from the
hmd was just such a pain in the ass
getting tangled on my my legs on my
ankles my feet I even pulled out the the
cables out of the little module like
four or five times just because
especially in the game like hollow point
where you're turning around constantly
and moving quite a bit it was definitely
a huge annoyance and I feel like if this
was to be a sustained in order to be a
sustainable workout method I would want
a wireless chipset on that bad boy like
I think that vibe or HTC's recently been
pushing the TP cast which is like a
wireless 60 gigahertz module that
connects to the vibe and it's wireless
so you're completely untethered I would
love to get one of those I think that's
kind of necessary if you are going to be
using VR to workout the second thing
were the earbuds so if you notice at the
beginning I had some earbuds towards the
end I actually took them out I took them
out probably within the first 20 minutes
because as I started to sweat it's
really gross I know it started to sort
of lubricate the the earpieces and it's
sort of like just falling out of my ears
any time I turn around we just fall out
it was really annoying so I eventually
just took the earbuds out and had to use
a speaker because I still wanted that
upbeat hollow point music to get me in
the zone and stuff but the other thing I
would say is you could use I could have
used like some over the ear headphones
or some standard head headphones but I
don't currently have any that have a
tight enough clamp
for us and those also would just fly off
my head in a game like hollow point so
something to consider there and the last
issue that I have a sort of experiencing
is sort of like the lesser of the three
evils that I'm talking about here but it
with space physical space and and Greta
I do have a dedicated area here in the
office but like the dimensions barely
meet the requirements for room scale
support for the HTC vive so I did feel
quite limited and just how much I was
able to roam around in the game and that
sort of held me back because there was
always that thought in the back of my
mind that I might you know slam my hand
into a metal edge on my shelving or
puncture the monitor with one of the
controllers things like that kept me
from being able to really let go and go
full throttle in the game itself so
there are some things to consider there
if you were attempting to go this route
for for your exercise routine the other
thing that I want to mention here and
I'll close this video up is the data
tracking that we picked up from the the
vivosmart HR + the garment I do have
some metrics here but they don't really
fall in line with what I was seeing in
the VR of the upload VR article and
that's probably there's a number of
factors at play that could be causing
that variance but I was only seeing 231
calories burned in that whole hour that
seems I mean I definitely felt and
looked like I burned a lot more than
around 200 calories but I'll keep a
close eye on I'll do some more
investigation as time goes on and these
next four weeks but distance seems a bit
more in line two point three eight miles
so almost two and a half miles
not bad for being in my room the whole
time that was at an average speed of 1.7
miles per hour and I think I did look at
my band at one point and saw my heart
rate going about around 90 beats per
minute I don't know what my target you
know heart rate is supposed to be or
anything like that but it sounds higher
than it normally is which is like five I
don't know probably dying if it was five
but honestly I think that sort of wraps
up what I have to say in this video guys
part two is going to be around 30 days
from now bear in mind I actually have to
make the video after the 30 days so
let's let's say 32 to 35 days from this
date a video part 2 will go up in part 2
we'll also sort of go over whether or
not VR makes sense as it were
scout tool and this isn't something that
I really considered at the beginning of
making this little series I was just
like let's see if I can lose weight and
now I'm like well what if it works what
if it's actually really great and I want
to continue doing it I'm going to give
my full opinion on using VR as a workout
tool in part two so that should be
pretty exciting as well be sure to
subscribe to the channel so you don't
miss that and a bunch of other tech
content that's going to be coming much
sooner but that's going to do it for now
guys thank you so much be sure to toss
me a like on the video if you enjoyed it
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
