awesomesauce Network welcome back to the
channel today I'm going to be doing a
thorough unboxing and overview of this
gaming keyboard from Corsair this is
their RGB I'm sorry they're k70 RGB
gaming mechanical keyboard in Cherry MX
red switches now there's been a lot of
hype around the k70 RGB that being said
I was going to do a thorough unboxing
and overview for you guys today because
I know a lot of you are very interested
in it and have been following the
whereabouts and all of the updates that
Corsair has been releasing on this
keyboard so now that it's finally out on
the market I'm going to do a thorough
walkthrough of the keyboard itself as
well as the software because honestly
90% of this keyboard and what makes it
special is the software so please
forgive this extremely long video it's a
lot longer than my average videos but I
think you guys are going to benefit from
it especially if you're thinking about
dropping 170 bucks on this thing I'm
sure you want to know as much as there
is to know about it so on that note I'm
going to take it out of the box and
we're gonna have a closer look all right
so really quickly guys inside the box
you get a warranty guide as well as a
handy-dandy wrist rest for economic
comfort if you guys are familiar at all
with the original K 70 this is pretty
much the exact same wrist rest just
snaps onto the bottom like so it also
has these rubber pads to keep your
keyboard from sliding around other than
that you'll notice that I actually have
two keyboards out here the bottom which
of which is the k70 RGB and the top one
is a regular k70 keyboard non RGB so i
just wanted to pull them out really
quick to give you a reference of
comparison between the two and you'll
notice right off the bat they're pretty
much exactly identical in physicality
with a couple exceptions the first of
which is that the K 17 on RGB has this
WASD button which basically lights up
the WASD and arrow keys in red whereas
that button is completely omitted on the
RGB bottle because of course you'll be
able to configure all of that within the
software itself another physical
difference you'll notice between these
two keyboards is that the non RGB K 70
actually has a USB 2.0 pass-through on
it where the RGB version does not and
you're probably wondering why does this
$170 more updated recent keyboard not
have a USB 2.0 pass-through and I really
haven't done too much research myself I
still am wanting to reach out to Corsair
to find out an actual answer to this
question but my
right now is that they had to make some
extra room for whatever led controller
is powering this RGB keyboard and as a
result they had to sacrifice a USB 2.0
pass-through like I said just a theory
I'm not sure if that's what it is
but I can find out more about that and
let you guys know in the future but that
is a difference to keep in mind
additionally you do have a polling rate
in BIOS which on on both keyboards it's
exactly identical it lets you switch
between one two four and eight
millisecond pulling rates so depending
on your preferences if you even notice
the difference when changing your
polling rate that option is available to
you but beyond that these two keyboards
are pretty much the same you get a full
QWERTY keyboard layout a full numpad
multimedia functions including stop
rewind play pause and fast-forward you
have a volume knob up and down as well
as a mute button some LED indicators as
well as a Windows lock button as well as
a brightness adjustment that gives you
four levels of brightness completely off
33% 66% and 100% brightness aside from
that this is a full aluminum
construction it's a brushed aluminum
finish just like the regular case 79 RGB
model and you do also get that braided
six-foot cable that is not detachable
which I personally like because it means
that there won't be any potential for a
port to get damaged if this thing gets
moved around too much and also you get
four feet on the back that pop out to
elevate this keyboard for ergonomic
purposes and you also have some rubber
padding back there to make sure that it
doesn't slip and slide around the last
difference that I wanted to point out
between these two keyboards lies
underneath the key caps themselves so
here looking at the k70 RGB keyboard
first off does have cherry MX red
switches which is nice and you also get
a clear casing underneath the key cap as
opposed to a solid black casing with the
non RGB version but the real difference
here are the three LEDs that are
underneath each of these key caps as
opposed to one led on the case
seventy-nine RGB now the reason why this
has three LEDs per key is because it has
a red green and blue value for each of
these LEDs and based on the combination
of those three colors you can get an
almost infinite color range to choose
from when you're in the software so
based on those values you get up to
sixteen point eight million different
colors to choose from which is quite
frankly the biggest difference between
the RGB keyboard versus its predecessor
now beyond that I did want to point out
that the US
connectors here for both keyboards serve
slightly different functions the one for
the non RGB keyboard has one for power
as well as a second one for that USB 2.0
pass-through whereas the RGB keyboard
has one for power and a second one for
even more power to actually power every
single LED that's on this keyboard now
keep in mind that each of these keys
have three LEDs underneath them so
you're going to need a little bit more
juice and that's what that second USB
port is for now that said let's go on to
the really in depth and really complex
software but we're going to we're going
to power through it and it's gonna be
cool it's gonna be awesome
alright so now we're finally going to
get into the meat of this video which is
the software as I might have mentioned
earlier it's going to take up the bulk
of this video because it's so complex
and in-depth there's a lot to it and
I've actually undergone the task of
reading through the whole thing it's
about 140 pages which is just cruel and
unusual of course there but it is very
thorough and I appreciate all the
attention to detail that they included
in this ridiculous manual so if you're
up to the task yourself go ahead and go
to Corsair comm slash downloads and you
can download the manual as well as the
software which of course you're going to
need to take full advantage of this
keyboard so that being said you can
actually find the Corsair software in
your system tray you go down here you
can right-click it and there's some
options so you've got a list of your
various profiles that you've created by
default there is a profile already made
called default and you can just manually
switch between those by clicking on them
you can also enable automatic profile
switching which we'll get more into in a
bit as well as hide or show your OSD
your on-screen display which I'll talk
about more later help about stop all
macros disable control break listening
and you can quit but for now we're just
going to go into the software so go
ahead and double click that icon and
here we are we are in the software now
the first thing I want to talk about
here is profiles now you can create
different profiles based on your various
needs that you might have when using
your computer so for example you can
create a profile for editing called
editing when you're using Adobe Premiere
Pro cs6 for example or Creative Cloud or
Vegas whatever it is or you can have a
different profile for gaming for example
you can even get specific and make a
profile for an individual
game so you could have a battlefield 4
profile for when you when you're playing
battlefield 4 so to create a new profile
you go into the profiles tab make sure
that's selected and you click new and
I'm going to type via 4 here oops
sorry for the typos guys the tripods
right in front of me to get this angle
of the keyboard so it's a little funky
but you can write some notes here
battlefield 4 game profile right very
useful notes and you can also link each
profile to a specific program if you
want to enable that automatic profile
selection like I was talking about
earlier when I was in the system tray so
basically you can go browse and find
battlefield 4 and you can link it so
that anytime you start a battlefield 4
this profile gets automatically selected
and boom you're in it you don't have to
do it anything you have to think about
it it's quite a no-brainer which is nice
and also you have some on-screen display
settings so anytime this profile gets
enabled you can choose whether or not to
display the mode that you're in and for
how long that displays as well as the
DPI that you've set and as well as a
timer and I'll get more into timers in a
bit but for now I'm going to make a 5
second display for both mode and dpi
anytime I select the battlefield 4
profile click OK I'm going to uncheck
this I'm not actually going to link it
right now for the sake of the video and
I'm going to click OK
and as you can see here in your drop
down menu of profiles you have
battlefield 4 now and just beneath that
you have your list of modes so for
whatever profile you might be in or
selecting you have a list of modes just
beneath that now modes you can create a
number of modes for different further
specific functions in each profile so
for example in the battlefield 4 profile
you might have a mode for sniping so you
might have a sniper mode or you might
have a medic mode based on your specific
needs so to create a new mode you're
going to go into the mode list which is
this left column right here this left
panel you're gonna hit the plus sign and
you can make a new mode and let's call
this one sniper and keep you all right
have types of notes there and there you
can see your sniper mode appears just
below your default mode and you can
orient the
the arrangement of these different modes
by right clicking and dragging them to
your heart's desire and there is a
reason for that this this order does
matter if you want it to and so I'm
going to explain that in a bit so for
now I'm going to order it like this and
there are several different things that
you can do with these modes alright so
for one if you select the little menu
icon next to the specific mode you can
edit that mode you can delete it you can
duplicate the mode in case you want a
one if you want to create a second mode
that's very similar to this existing one
but you don't want to have to redo all
the configurations that you previously
assigned you can just duplicate it and
then modify it from there it'll save you
a lot of time you can also reset all the
mode settings to default and you can
skip this mode in mode switching when
you're switching back and forth between
different modes and I'm going to explain
this in a bit too you can also export
your modes and share them with friends
or just have them on hand as backups in
case you accidentally delete one or and
whatnot you can also import those modes
with this icon right here pretty sweet
stuff so as you might imagine it's
pretty easy to quickly rack up a high
number of different profiles and modes
in this software so you really need an
easy way to switch between all of those
relatively quickly and there is a way to
do that
so first you want to select your profile
battlefield 4 and your mode default that
you wish to edit you're going to right
click the key that you wish to assign
the role or task of mode selection or
switching click that and it brings up
these various options the first of which
is direct mode selection so this lets
you choose exactly which mode you want
to switch to when you press that button
you also have switch to next mode in the
list so this is also your modes list so
if you enable that it'll actually go
from default to sniper and in the sniper
mode if you have that enable that would
go from sniper to medic because medics
the next one in the list and if you
check the box that says loop back to the
top when reaching the end of that list
when you reach the bottom you get to
medic and you press that key again it'll
go back to default which is nice it just
lets you cycle through all of them
seamlessly so you don't hit a dead end
when you reach the bottom of the list
which which kind of suck especially in
mid game you can also go backwards so if
you want to start from medic and then go
to sniper and then go to default and so
forth you can also loop that as well and
you can
by this setting to the same button or
key in the current profile and that's
good because when you're doing mode
selection switching and you're assigning
a key that task you want to make sure
that it's consistent across all modes so
you can see after I selected that under
the sniper mode we now have the tilde
also switching modes as well as the
medic it's also the mode switching key
now as well and of course you can assign
a key to switch between different
profiles so you can select that and once
again you have your direct selection a
direct profile selection option just
like with the modes so you can select
any of the profiles that you have there
specifically or you can have it scroll
through a list and you actually have to
define this list because unlike modes
where it already has a list configured
your profiles are all in a drop-down
menu so there's really no standardized
list for it you kind of have to make it
yourself so go ahead and select your
list whatever order so let's say I want
default to be the first in that list and
then battlefield 4 and then editing so
now it's going to go you can select
either go to the select the next profile
on the list or the previous profile on
the list depending on your your
preference and you can have it loop if
you want as well go ahead and click
assign and now you have a profile
switching button and if you press the
tilde you can see down here and your
tray I'm now in default profile and just
like the modes you can right click your
profile switching key and you can clone
it to all modes in profile so even if
you go to your sniper mode here this is
now the profile switching key same with
default all right so once you've made a
couple modes that you're happy with you
can start assigning actions to
individual keys now there's a lot of
different things you can do here so to
get started you want to make sure that
you've selected the profile as well as
the mode that you wish to edit and then
go ahead and right-click any one of
these keys you wish to assign an action
to you can pretty much select any key
here even the multimedia multimedia keys
as well as the brightness and Windows
lock key even the mute button the only
thing you can't assign a function to or
an action to is the volume wheel itself
from the top right corner here but for
these purposes I will right click the
tilde button
and I'm going to assign a new action and
over here we've got a new menu the
actions editor there's a bunch of
options here
I'm just going to go down the list one
by one so starting with macro you can
name your macro and starcraft2 is the
first thing that comes to mind when I
think of macros on a gaming keyboard and
you can type in any notes that you might
have so this is secret attack no one
else will know unless they're watching
this video and then from there you can
just hit record when you're ready to
record your your keystrokes or your key
presses so you just from here just type
whatever you want space backspace enter
tab qo6 there we go alright that's good
enough I'm going to stop recording and
as you can see it's recorded my list of
actions that I just put in even records
the delays or the pauses in real time
that I recorded as well now some of you
may like this and may want these pauses
kept in there if you're being really
specific or sometimes you just want it
to run instantaneously and you want to
get rid of all these pauses if you just
want to get rid of one pause you can
right-click it and delete or you can you
can do that for anything really if you
accidentally pressed key one when you
meant to press key to you can right
click delete all right click delete and
then you can add in a stroke or even a
mouse event so you can add a mouse click
event a mousemove event or a keyboard
event so in this case I'm going to click
keyboard event a key press and I'm going
to hit to and now you can either insert
that that move below or above the
highlighted position right here so I'm
going to insert it above and as you can
see press key to is is now has now been
recorded and also you're probably going
to want to do something like add in a
release key too so I'm going to right
click here add another keyboard event
key release and - and we're going to go
insert above and voila all right now if
you want to get rid of all of these all
of these pauses you can clear all the
delays and now you can see it's just the
keystrokes that have been recorded you
also have the option to undo if you made
a boo-boo
which is very forgiving but I didn't
make a boo-boo I want to clear all the
delays and you also have some other
macro options here on the right side you
can choose when you want your macro to
start whether you want to start it right
when you press that key that you're
assigning it to or when you release that
key up to you
double macros you can enable a second
macro when you release this key it'll
start a second one and you can actually
choose from a list of pre-made macros or
I'm sorry macros that you've made here's
a list of some macros that I created in
the past so let's do renders I don't
know why you'd have a render macro
when you're playing Starcraft 2 but
whatever you can also choose when this
macro is terminated if at all so you can
have it run interrupted uninterrupted
I'm sorry or you can allow interruptions
and then resume so if you press the
assigned key it starts the macro but if
you press it again it'll pause it and
then you can press it again to resume
all right you can also terminate the
macro completely when you press the
assign key a second time or you can
actually queue a second macro while
you're executing the first one so let's
say I press the tilde it executes macro
one I'm sorry it executes that macro and
if I press it again it's it's going to
queue the second macro so when that
first one finishes it's going to start
the second one so there's a lot of
different functionality here it gets
really detailed and you can really just
spend hours configuring all these
different functions you can also choose
whether or not you want this macro to
repeat on or off so depending on if you
tap the assigned key you can have the
action repeat itself while pressed while
you're pressing the key in as well as
just none at all or you can have it
repeat a specific number of times as
well as delay the amount of time between
these action repeats it just goes on and
on as far as all the customizability
here so you can change it constantly in
milliseconds or you can actually have it
delay
in random intervals between x and y
amounts of milliseconds and lastly
you've got some options here for
lighting so I'm going to get into
lighting later but for now all you need
to know here is that you can assign
different lighting effects to these
individual actions so when you press
that tilde button if you want it to
create a ripple effect or if you wanted
to create if you just want it to turn
green for five seconds you can
configure that in the Lighting's tab and
you can pull down the drop down menu and
select green when you're done
configuring all these settings in the
actions editor you can click OK let's do
OK and now if you highlight that that
assigned key you can see that it says
Starcraft 2 there you go and when you
press that key it'll execute your macro
so that's that's cool so the next action
you can assign a key is the text action
this is a bit more straightforward than
a macro I'm going to go ahead and name
this screw you guys and some notes now
this is pretty simple basically let's
say there's something that you generally
type out whether it's a string of
numbers or letters or words or it's a
sentence let's say it's a phrase that
you commonly say in in-game chat when
you're playing games something like
screw you guys I'm going home let's say
you say that a lot and you're you're
sick and tired of typing it all out over
and over so you can actually assign that
to an action key and you can choose
whether or not you want a delay in
between characters in a matter of
milliseconds and you can choose if you
want this action to repeat based on
these various functions basically the
same options that you saw with the macro
are available with the txt action so led
functionality as well you can select one
of these let's say I want to do a ripple
and you click OK now the next action on
the list is keystroke so various
functions like copy paste or opening up
the Start menu can all be done with a
single click of the key with the
keystroke function so I'm going to name
this copy and yeah add some notes you
always got to add a note in there and
you've got a drop down list here so
there's some some pre-configured ones
that they've written out for you
so you can go to they got things like
switching between open programs so your
alt tab saving all copy paste I'm going
to select copy there you go
same actions here action repeat delay
between actions lighting effects all
that jazz and you select ok and now when
you hit tilde you've copied and of
course I think if you did something like
that it would make sense to have another
key you would assign another key paste
so you have two keys copy and paste and
probably one for cut as well next up you
can assign keys to open up certain
applications or programs
with the shortcut function so here we
see text editor calculator File Explorer
or you can run a specific program just
go ahead and browse through your
computer and select it so let's say I
want to assign Photoshop to my f1 key I
could do that you got some program
arguments which are optional lighting
effects as well click OK and there you
go moving on to the DPI now it does say
in the muses manual that this function
is coming soon or coming later on and as
you can see here if you try setting a
DPI your DPI to a certain value doesn't
work nothing's working so I think this
is going to come in the future Corsair
is probably going to work work out this
in the future patch hopefully but you
can see here just kind of take a look
you can have a sniper option while
pressed or toggle it on and off you can
switch to the next dpi stage in your
performance settings I can't really show
this off right now like I said they're
probably gonna release this in the
future patch and next up on the list you
can assign a timer to any given key if
you want to have a timer show up on
screen and count down and alert you when
it reaches zero so that I don't know if
your in game and time is a huge factor
you might want some timers on screen so
that you know when to execute your next
attack for example so I'm just going to
do a short timer right here you can type
in 5 seconds or however many minutes and
seconds you want you can have it play a
sound when the timer reaches zero to
alert you that your time has run out and
you can actually have it play a certain
number of times almost like a snooze
between a number of seconds however many
times you want it to repeat as well as
ramped up the volume you can assign a
lighting effect when it reaches 0 as
well as execute another action that
you've defined previously all from
within this actions editor moving out of
the mouse you can choose to have a
certain key act as a mouse function as a
mouse click a right-click the middle
click go forward back all this different
stuff you can have even scroll while
pressed or not lighting effects good
stuff and last but not least you can
assign media controls to pretty much any
key on the board play play pause stop
previous track all that jazz is all
right here alright so once you've
assigned a number of different actions
to various keys there is a way to
quickly apply those predefined actions
by going to your actions list down here
and hearings up a little window
of all the actions that you've created
now you can just literally drag and drop
to any key that you want and it will
assign that particular action to that
key so it's very handy if you want a
more comprehensive look at all of your
actions you can go up here to the
actions tab and here we can see the
entire list of everything that you've
created and you can even organize it and
view it by by action type so if you want
to look at all your keystrokes that
you've made or all of your mouse
functions you can also show all of
course and that's that's really handy to
have now really quickly I did want to
head over to the performance tab and
here you've got some options for your
Windows lock button on your keyboard so
by default it disables your Windows key
but you can uncheck that if you want to
or you can also have it disabled alt f4
and alt tab as well if you wanted to
assign a completely different function a
customized function to that key you
could uncheck all of them and it won't
perform any of these functions there's
also a greyed out section here for your
polling rate but I think obviously you
can just change the polling rate with
the switch on the back of your keyboard
if you're so inclined the most notable
and prominent feature on this keyboard
is undoubtedly its led functionality and
all the different lighting effects that
you can do on this keyboard so with that
said I'm going to select my battlefield
4 profile and I'm going to select my
default mode and we're going to go over
to the lighting tab and once again you
have your k70 keyboard layout but now
all the keys are red and the keys will
light up whatever color is assigned to
them so by default the software assigned
all my background lighting to be red and
there are three different types of
lighting within the software there's
background lighting there's foreground
lighting and type lighting so first I'm
going to talk about background lighting
which is exactly what it sounds like
it's the default or background color of
all the keys on your board and you can
basically choose up to sixteen point
eight million different colors to your
liking so if you want to change the
background color you can select all and
that highlights all the keys on the
board and you can right-click one of the
color boxes below which will
automatically bring up this color
selector window you've got a bunch of
basic colors that are predefined that
you can choose from you've got a hue or
a gradient box where you can get more
specific or even get really specific and
enter values for your hue saturation RGB
values and you can even punch in your
6-digit HTML hex code if you if you're
so inclined if you want to save a
particular
particular color let's say you like this
shade of blue you can right-click this
color swatch and drag it over to the
custom color section drop it in there
and you've added that color too to your
to your custom colors press ok and boom
it automatically updates all the keys
are now set to that particular color and
you have a new background color now and
you can also adjust the brightness here
which does the same thing as the
brightness button brightness adjustment
button as well I'm going to leave it at
100 so you guys can see it a little bit
better now you'll probably notice that
the WASD and arrow keys are lit up in a
slightly different color and that's
because these specific keys are arranged
into groups that have been predefined by
the software but you can create new
groups and you can edit them you can
even delete or edit these ones that are
already here and assign them new
lighting functions and that type of
lighting is called foreground lighting
which obviously is going to be different
than your background lighting so I'm
going to get into groups right now and
I'm going to show you how to make a new
group on your keyboard so you can right
click up in this general area and click
new group and let's call this one
numbers okay there you go
and now you have a new group called
numbers but we haven't yet assigned any
keys to that group so we can do that
right now you can either hold ctrl and
select all of them individually like so
or you can just click and drag and from
there you can also control click
additional ones that you want to select
or deselect like that and once you've
selected a number of keys that you wish
to include you can right click go to add
to group and you can select that group
that you just created or you can go to
new group altogether and just create a
new group from there so for now we're
going to go to numbers and voila
when you click numbers now it highlights
all of the keys that are in that group
and now you can assign some foreground
lighting to this group so you want to go
right click and assign new lighting this
is where it gets good guys trust me
alright so for this lighting effect
we'll call it let's call it solid solid
yellow so you've got four basic LED
functions here on the left
solid gradient ripple and wave I'm going
to start with solid for now I'm going to
right click in this color graph and
select add
and it puts up a couple markers here I'm
going to right-click within this range
and I'm going to select edit and that
lets me select a color of my choosing
I'm going to go with yellow since I
named this function solid yellow I'm
going to select okay
it has taken effect here and basically
you're in a bit of a graph here so
you've got a y-axis representing the
intensity of the LED of this particular
function and you've got an x-axis
representing the duration or how long
this LED lasts or how long it lights up
and you can choose the specific value of
each of these tickers by selecting the
end point which I think by default is
set to 10 seconds so at 10 seconds that
basically means that this last ticker
right here on the x-axis represents 10
seconds so that means at halfway it
would be 5 seconds and this would be 1
second alright so if you wanted the LED
function if you wanted the key to light
up for one second
you would do something like this the
same thing would occur if you selected
the endpoint to be 1 second and you
dragged out the graph all the way to the
end still get in one second inputting a
lower value like 1 into this section
however is very useful if you want the
LED to last less than one second so here
in this configuration I would press the
key and it would light up for half of a
second and then turn off you've got a
flip option here so basically just
inverts it whatever it is so in this
scenario I would press the key it would
wait half of a second and then it would
turn yellow and then half a second later
it would turn off so hope that makes
sense
down here you can choose when this when
this when this function starts if you
want it to start with a mode you can do
that so anytime you select your default
mode in battlefield 4 this LED function
will execute or you can have it execute
on key press so I'm going to do key
press for now and you can also have you
can also select when it ends after a
certain number of times or on key press
or on release so for now I'm just going
to say after one time it's going to end
and here you can adjust the brightness
from 0 to 10 as well so I'm going to
select ok and as you can see the keys
turn yellow for half a second when I
press them but only in the group that
I've assigned it to and notice if I hit
anything else in any other group it
doesn't work so yay so this is this is
working alright so now I'm going to go
on to a different different led function
let's see what's next here
let's go assign new lighting and if you
assign a new lighting on to a group of
keys that already has a lighting action
it's going to overwrite it just like
with the actions that I mentioned
previously so let's go to gradient
gradient let's type in num gradient and
same thing here right click to add and
that adds one marker you're going to
want to add a second one most likely
let's make it in totes and you're going
to right click the actual marker itself
to add a color I'm going to edit let's
have the gradient go from red to green a
little darker green there all right so
this is your gradient looks good and
right now you can see once again that
this is set to ten seconds so this is a
10-second gradient that might be a
little too long for me so I'm going to
go something more reasonable like five
seconds and I'm going to click OK and
now when I select or hit one of these
keys it does a gradient from red to
green now really quick I did want to
mention that the gradient functionality
on this keyboard is probably my least
favorite out of the four different
functions you can choose from when we're
talking about lighting here and I think
the reason why is because it doesn't
really perform the way I expected it to
instead of smoothly transitioning from
one color that you've defined to the
next it kind of just stutters and it
jumps around from the next closest color
that it can find and it just doesn't
look very good in my personal opinion
but if you guys have had your own
experiences with the k70 RGB let me know
what you guys think maybe I just got a
dud and it's not performing well but I'm
pretty sure this is just how it's going
to look for all the retail models that
you guys might be seeing in the future
now with that said there are a couple
more cool features that you can do with
gradients that I'd like to show you so
in order to edit that lighting effect
that I just made or to edit any kind of
for ground lighting effect that you
might have made you want to select the
group that you wish to edit right-click
one of the highlighted keys and select
edit light and boom you're back into the
editor window so from here you can
actually right click within the graph
and click Add and you can add another
marker and you can add another one you
can add a bunch of markers if you want
and you can make this longer of course
to fit them all in there so now it's a
10 second gradient and you can add
specific colors more colors to your
gradient all right so now we have a four
color gradient going on here but there
is something else to consider if you for
instance wanted to have this gradient
repeat 5 times any time you press a key
in this group then it's going to go
through the motions of red blue yellow
green but then when it loops back to red
it's going to be a very abrupt change
and it's not going to be smooth like the
rest of the colors are even though I
just got done saying that the transition
between these gradient effects isn't
really that smooth it's going to be even
more abrupt going from green back to red
so what you can do here is slide this
over I'm going to add another marker and
I'm going to right click the red marker
and there's an option to clone to other
endpoint and as you can see now when it
goes to red when it loops back to the
beginning it'll be smooth yay and now
you're also kind of scrunching things
together here right so now it's going to
it's going to actually fade through
these colors a lot quicker because I
added another marker so of course you
can just change this to whatever you
want
15 seconds for example and now when you
click OK okay and there's your gradient
and there it goes
alright and it's going to repeat 5 times
and then it's going to stop beautiful
alright so moving on to the next item in
the list I believe is ripple so let's
create a ripple effect for and I want to
do a larger number of keys here so let's
create a new group I'm going to select
all of these right here these three rows
I do these four rows there we go
and I'll throw a backspace in there too
and we're going to create a new group by
once again right clicking add to group
now let's do a new group let's call this
typing keys click OK boom new group has
been created alright so now I'm going to
assign a new lighting to this group and
I'm going to name this lighting effect
ripple and stuff ok select ripple
right-click add right-click add and
let's select some colors here you've got
let's do a kind of a pink color and
let's do let's go blue and why don't we
why don't we add a couple more in here
just just for the hell of it let's do
something like this did you do yeah
let's do like a teal this is kind of
reminds me of like a fountain
it reminds me of Kirby's fountain of
Dreams now pardon the abrupt jump cut
here guys I was explaining what
taillights were and I got some of the
information wrong so I'm just going to
rerecord it but basically the x-axis
when you're in the ripple mode as well
as the wave mode for that matter no
longer represents duration of the effect
it actually represents how how many keys
your gradient will span so for example
in the example I was just showing you
guys where I had 4 different colors if I
had 4 taillights selected and I had
entered that value that would
essentially mean that it would go
through those 4 colors within 4 keys
from the epicenter of the ripple so if I
wanted it to span over 10 keys I could
do that as well and your gradient is
going to be a little bit more spread out
velocity affects how fast the ripple
shoots out from the center so you can go
all the way up to 99 I believe or 100 is
the max value that's super fast I'm
going to go somewhere in the middle
we'll go with 20 and duration lets you
define how long you want this ripple to
last you can also have it start with a
certain mode or onkeypress and you can
have it end with these various settings
as well
we'll leave brightness at 10 click OK
and now
ripple that's a cool color combination I
actually kind of like that color scheme
I might use that later so there you go
basically any key that you press on here
you'll notice the ripple starts from the
same spot it doesn't matter if you press
Q or if you press the question mark
the ripple starts from the center and it
goes outward now I've gone in here and
made some other adjustments I've changed
the velocity to 70 I've created a point
5 delay in between repetitions and I'm
going to have it repeat nine times upon
keypress so let's see what that looks
like boom there you go
it's going to go nine times at half
second intervals and that's that's just
the gist of it there's a lot of things
you can do here I'm sure if you guys get
your hands on one of these you'll be
doing way cooler things that I'm showing
you right now all right so next up let's
override this lighting effect and assign
a wave function it's call it something
fun and we're going to add some markers
here now the difference between wave and
ripple they're actually very similar but
the difference is
whereas ripple spreads out everywhere
wave only goes in one direction unless
you tell it otherwise so let's just do a
simple wave here and you guys are going
to see what I mean in just a second go
from red to blue all right
press ok and when I type and when I hit
a key it's going to do the way from left
to right doesn't matter where I hit it's
going to go from all the way to the left
all the way to the right and it's going
to do it in that color gradient that I
specified now there's a couple other
ways you can do this going to edit for
example if you wanted to have it shoot
out from both sides you can select the
two sides option and you can even select
which which degree I would agree you
want to shoot out so at 124 degrees
press ok press H now you can see they
kind of go at a 124 degree angle and
they also go both ways so this looks a
lot more like a ripple so one more thing
let's switch this up a bit here I'm
going to go to ten tail lights velocity
of 80 and a duration of 0.2 seconds and
we're going to repeat this ten times all
right sounds good
see what happens boom alright so that's
a little more seizure inducing than you
might like but it is an option it is a
possibility it's your life
I don't care alright so those are the
four led functions that are available to
you with
for ground lighting so we've covered
background lighting we just covered
group lighting or foreground lighting
and the third type of lighting in this
keyboard software is type lighting and
that's basically going to apply to every
single key on the board no matter what
group they're in and it basically
assigns them either a gradient a solid
or a ripple function so I'm going to
show you guys how to add one of those
basically you go to your profile of
choice make sure it's selected select
the profile menu under type lighting if
you could select single key it'll bring
up a familiar menu that has only
gradient as an option everything else is
grayed out so you right-click and add a
couple points now there's a way to cheat
this I suppose if you wanted a solid
color you could choose one and just
clone it to the other end and it's
basically a solid color click OK and now
when you press a key it turns that color
for the specified duration so I think 10
seconds was in there so it's going to
light up 10 seconds and then it's going
to go away and of course you can switch
that up by going back to the profile
menu type lighting single key and let's
make this a gradient this time going to
blue and in order to see that gradient
let's make it a little bit longer like
four seconds click OK now you'll see
when I press a key it will go through
that command and voila so that's one way
to do type lighting another way is to do
a ripple effect which I find a lot more
interesting go to multiple keys this
time and now you can see ripple is
selected and everything else is grayed
out so you want to add a couple points
here let's do some color business
alright so something like that that all
looks good I like a higher velocity
let's make it last two seconds I'd say
press ok and now when you hit it you get
a nice little ripple effect now notice
when you assign a ripple in type
lighting for example the ripple actually
starts from the individual key that you
press as opposed to always starting from
the middle if you were to assign a
ripple to a group for example so that
actually is pretty cool as you can see
it starts from the key which I actually
personally like a lot all right so now
keep
mind though if you have a group of keys
remember I had that those three rows of
typing keys as you can see right up here
that will still take effect even if you
enable type lighting so for example if I
hit H it still does that crazy wave
effect that I programmed earlier but it
also does the ripple effect now you'll
notice because when I press H you'll see
the ripple actually occur in the keypad
it actually extends all the way across
the keyboard and that's cool
I'm sure if you guys get your hands on
one of these things you'll be able to do
some way crazier things than what I'm
showing in this video and I'd love to
see some of that so share your
experiences with me in the comments
below as well now additionally in this
lighting tab you also have a lighting
effects list which is very similar to
the actions list that I showed you guys
earlier it basically lets you apply any
of these predefined functions that
you've already made to any grouping of
keys that you've already made as well so
I'm going to select typing keys and I'm
going to go to this ripple effect and
I'm just going to drag and drop it it's
gonna ask me if I want to override the
current light settings on this group to
which I will reply okay and now you can
see when I press it it does that it
doesn't do seizure II seizure inducing
movements anymore it's it's kind of a
nice gentle gentle gentle pattern there
so so there you guys go you can also get
a more in-depth look just like you have
the actions the actions list you also
have a lighting list as well where you
can organize them by type or you can
show all of them and from there you can
do the same things as with actions edit
delete duplicate or export export I
should say I pronounced that funny and
that's pretty much it other than that
you got a settings tab where you can
program your different settings here's a
just a general look at your device you
can choose which kind of keyboard layout
you'd like you can update your firmware
from within the software which is really
nice all these program functions
different media players that it supports
there's just a kind of basic settings
here that that are nice to have also
technical support you can contact
Corsair straight from within the OS
which is very handy and I think that's
about it guys holy crap this has been a
long video I'm sure I missed a thing or
two here and there let me know
the comments below if there's any
questions that you have about it but
hopefully this will give you guys a
better idea of what the software entails
and what you're up against if you decide
to purchase one of these keyboards in
the future I'm going to go have a beer
now and probably some scotch alright
guys and that is going to wrap up this
incredibly long and exhaustive overview
and walkthrough of the corsair k70 RGB
gaming mechanical keyboard and Cherry MX
red switches stay tuned for blue and
browns coming soon and let me know what
you guys think of this keyboard in the
comment section below if this video
happened to sway your decision one way
or another and if you already happen to
own a k70 RGB let me know what you guys
think about it so far in the comments
below thank you all so much for your
feedback and for watching this video I'm
Kyle with awesome sales network be sure
to subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and I'll see you guys in
