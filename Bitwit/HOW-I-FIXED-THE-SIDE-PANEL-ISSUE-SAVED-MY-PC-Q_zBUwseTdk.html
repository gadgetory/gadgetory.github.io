the channel this is part 2 the follow-up
video to February's PC of the month
which is of course the lovely silver
build of mini which has to be found in
part one gave us some clearance issues
mainly because I did not look those
clearance issues up before I started
building so it's my fault I suck and now
I can no longer show my face in public
to give you a little recap I was trying
to fit in this gtx 1080i EVGA for the
win 3 before realizing it was just too
wide to fit at all so i moved over to
the gtx 1070 for the win also from EVGA
and that was also too wide to fit this
case so what I ended up having to do is
bend out this metal tab here which is
one of the four corners that hourglass
side panel mounts onto in order to get
this behemoth of a card in there and
even then barely fit the issue was that
because the card was so damn wide or
tall or high how ever you want to call
it this dimension the side panel still
wouldn't fit on because of the
interference with the power connectors
they were sticking out just too far out
of this already wide card in order to
get the glass securely mounted so it was
a fail it totally didn't work what I
ended up doing was swapping this card
out with the zotac gtx 980ti mini and
that managed to save the day not because
it's necessarily a narrow card in fact
it's only a few millimeters narrower
than this one or this one
the reason the glass panel fits with
this card is because the power
connectors are now located towards the
middle
of the case with this shorter length GPU
whereas before they were so close to
this corner mount that it was impossible
to thread that side panel screw now
admitting Li the glass is pushing up
very firmly against these sleeved cables
here but it's not doing any real harm to
the system outside the scope of
aesthetics so I'm perfectly fine with it
that's exactly how I tested this system
today was with all of the side panels
properly fastened and secured at the
very least you guys can learn from these
types of mistakes that I make on a very
regular basis but apart from that I'm
gonna try to do a better job of checking
all the clearance requirements and
compatibility with parts for builds
moving on moving forward from here on
out just because I do think that is
important and sometimes I've just get in
a rush and I overlook little things that
end up turning into bigger problems so I
promise you guys I'm gonna work on that
on that note let's talk about this
system how is it performing what kind of
overclocks are we getting on its
temperatures acoustics benchmarks and
all that stuff starting with the 8700 K
that we have in here I did overclock
that quite aggressively to 5 gigahertz
at one point three five volts run and
rock solid stable didn't crash once
during my stress test or any of our
benchmarks so it is looking really good
this thing is an absolute beast 6 cores
12 threads and very high overclocking
potential it is currently the fastest
CPU on the market if you're talking
about gaming so one thing you do have to
be wary of when running this chip at
such a high frequency is thermals and
sure enough we're keeping temperatures
to a minimum with the corsair h 100 I
hear that's being paired with two of
those Redux not to a fans which a lot of
you guys we're complaining about in part
one I even got these same complaints in
the original silver build video that I
posted a couple years ago people are
saying these fans are not designed for
radiators they're not designed with
static pressure in mind they're a
terrible choice for any AO or radiator
which okay maybe on a spec sheet it
doesn't say you should definitely pair
this with a radiator but the
temperatures we're seeing here proves
otherwise we're getting anywhere from 60
to 70 degrees Celsius under a heavy load
to 2560 by 1440 and Unigine Heaven 4.0
60s and 70s guys at 5 gigahertz is
really not bad at all of course there
are those occasional outlier spikes that
we get into the higher double digits I
saw it go all the way up to 95 at one
point but it was literally just for a
second 99% of the time this thing is
running pretty cool off
considered so sometimes you got to peel
yourself away from the spec sheet and
just test the damn thing yourself to
realize it works perfectly fine in
practice who knew so far our system is
looking real nice we've got a solid
overclock with decent thermals on the
fastest gaming CPU on the market these
benchmarks are going to crash
now the graphics card may not be quite
as interesting to talk about because I
didn't overclock it the reason for that
being is that we already have a very
powerful GP 102 chip being stuffed and
crammed inside of a sub 7-inch PCB and
cooler when most Kennedy ti coolers look
like this they're massive so all that
horsepower on such a small cooler I
didn't want to push things and it's
already pretty quick enough as it is
from what I remember when I first tested
this card out several months ago so as
you might assume it's getting pretty
warm in fact we hit 85 degrees Celsius
at our hottest with average temperatures
hovering around 83 84 degrees Celsius
under load which is around the same
temperature that you would see on a
Founders edition 1080i maybe a touch
warmer but at the same time this card is
significantly quieter so there's the
trade oh speaking of acoustics I was
very impressed just how quiet this
system runs under load it's insane the
Noctua fans are doing their thing these
are probably better I know for a fact
that they're better than the stock
Corsair fans that come with this cooler
and for the price they definitely should
be but damn this thing's quite even
these little 80 millimetres I mean the
system's not on right now but when it is
even these little 80 millimeters they're
pushing they're moving air man and
they're seriously quiet and they're
moving I'm getting cold but enough of my
yammering you guys want to see the
benchmarks I tested six games and one
synthetic being fire strike ultra
because this is an ultra worthy system
the games were tested at three
resolutions 1920 by 1080 2560 by 1440
and 4k of course I am using the latest
drivers latest wiffle drivers for NVIDIA
that is driving
the driver is I'll put it right here and
I should also mention the memory is
running at it's rated 3000 megahertz
speed that is 16 gigs of the corsair
dominator Platinum's ddr4 with that said
ladies and gentlemen here your
benchmarks for the silver build me
holus some mochas this thing is in anima
and so fast these frame rates that were
getting are just through the roof
starting with 1080 let's to go with 1920
by 1080 and we'll scale our way up from
there at 1080 we are seeing some
phenomenal numbers well over the hundred
FPS mark in fact if you had a system
that was kitted out similar to this one
I would seriously consider investing in
a one hundred and forty four Hertz
monitor because this thing is capable of
taking you to that level it is that damn
quick at 1440p obviously it scales down
a little bit we are still seeing over
100 FPS on average in every title that
we tested with the exception of ashes of
the singularity because it's a stubborn
son of a gun but that being said pair
this with the g-sync display or
something like that and it is smooth
sailing whether you're doing 1920 by
1080 or 1440p that also goes for ultra
wide resolutions if it can run 2560 by
1440 pretty damn well that well then
ultra white is not going to be an issue
in fact it's gonna be a lot easier to
run the ultra wide resolution then 4k
for example in it even at 4k this thing
is topping 60fps on average in every
game except pub G because that game is
of course horribly optimized and also a
stubborn son of a bitch All Things
Considered this is a remarkable system
it's much quieter than I expected to be
for how small and fast it is and it is
probably one of the most powerful if not
the most powerful mini ITX gaming pcs
I've ever built
honestly 1080i with an 80 700 K
overclocked to the max geez gosh I rest
my case
and it's this one but that is all I have
for you guys today so thank you so much
