disturbing hi everyone and welcome to
awesome hardware are we live to both
should be okay I guess we could start
the show
hello welcome awesome Hardware episode
181 side a in about half an hour maybe
even less because I didn't really
prepare for my half at all today we'll
be switching over to Paul's half that
can be found in the link in my
description below or you can just stay
where you are if you're watching us on
Twitch we'd like to have a few drinks on
the show and we get a little rowdy
sometimes if you're if you're sensitive
to adult language that be warned
occasionally you'll slip out but haste
full we have good intent we have good
intentions it's it's appropriate when
used just right we never we ever swear
out of line yeah but some people still
have stick up their asses about that
kind of shit oh say see that I did that
right no that was Joe's irony
it was my middle name Kyle I'm drinking
a rogue hazelnut Brown nectar that's a
good beer which is delicious these are
delicious have you had this one yet no
that's new show demand reppin that over
there I don't mind it all aftershock
Brewing Company peanut alert red ale
from Temecula Temecula huh to Merck
mercury I made it this handmade they
didn't even use barrels or equipment
they just holds the beer there just hold
it up hold the hops up to the Sun and
turns into alright cool well thank you
guys for joining us it's it's gonna be a
fun day we have a lot of good news to
talk about it's gonna be awesome
on Paul's half because again I didn't
really prepare so I've got like three
maybe like three stories and we're gonna
do ask the audience on my half nope it
by PC today which would have been a
great opportunity to do it because it
definitely fills up a lot of time
essentially but I was even too
unprepared for that so you know some
days I'm just gonna rough it some days
are better than others one of those you
know
I think we'll get through it anyway and
I think I think so well I'll learn
something along the way maybe even
something about ourselves yes so let's
let's divert no no first of all we have
to whore ourselves out yeah so my store
I have an online store bit weight tech a
lot of the same stuff that has been
there for years actually is still there
including these good why would you get
rid of good things including the stay
positive t-shirt that I always CJ
wearing positive should be there
somewhere but the the t-shirt material
what do they call this again this fabric
cotton cotton no it's a tri-blend
tri-blend tri-blend shirts are very
comfy you should try to blend just try
to blend in yep mouse pads and stuff
pulse Paul's a story's pulsar Burnett
pulsar bird they have a brand new
t-shirt design it's a great design it's
a great design that's actually printed
on multiple pieces of merchandise it's
the captive thumbscrew look at he's so
sad the only thing that could cheer him
up is if you bought one of his shirts or
about what of his items he's a
thumbscrew he's came to jail cells have
to drum screw I'd like to see you and
your friends will get it and other
people will be like where's the one on
it to you I want to see like a revision
of this where he's in the toilet or like
on the toilet like a thumb screw he's
shitting the thumb screw shitting me the
jail cell toys and more medic does it be
harder to tell what he was I think I
haven't want to see I want to see the
artist depiction of that because his
threads would be covered by that he
would actually be in the toilet or maybe
maybe he wouldn't be maybe he's found a
way to you know maybe he said sideways
takes a dump sideways I mean I've seen
cats poop in it I wouldn't I wouldn't
judge him for that
I think I'm screwed it's a shoo-in so
yeah thank you for buying stuff from our
stores will yell Johnson that you at the
end of the show don't they have to party
up into during the after party um and we
can move on to some tech news groovy
let's dive into this first article from
w CCF tech about the rise in 3000 series
CPUs we're all anxiously awaiting its
mid 2019 watch and this this article is
basically saying that there's now been
some some bio support some updates that
have been trickling into various X 370
and X 470 motherboy
it's from a couple different
manufacturers so as generally codenamed
as Valhalla and internally codenamed as
Valhalla I hope that becomes externally
bad because that sounds bad that is a
pretty bad s codename Viking
mother-effing that's code name right
AMD's kind of up and there they're
coming at Intel from all angles like oh
you're gonna name your crap after Lakes
yeah how about Valhalla Elysium I want
to see I want I want the Elysium update
Africa afterwards yeah well yeah no
that's that's true other synonyms and
don't don't Vikings like like sail on
lakes so it's kind of like it's also
like another jab you know like we we own
you we're literally on top of you that's
an interesting - you're the medium in
that you could be used to coast oh that
would be pretty deep maybe there's
somebody at AMD watching right now who's
like who came up with a it's like he got
it they get me everyone didn't tell said
I was crazy fire this guy so that's
exciting so far it's a very small list
of mother motherboard manufacturers
who've been really releasing BIOS
updates for the 3000 series they include
Asus MSI and biostar they released the
new I guess it's a gator right geez geez
oh geez
double oh seven zero and double oh seven
- I think the pronunciation of an
acronym is is always up for
interpretation right yeah let's try and
still go back to BIOS update update your
BIOS everyone I like biosis sounds
foreign and that we fee do a new segment
or something so that's exciting
eventually all the boards will receive
updates so thanks AMD or staying true to
your word of future compatibility
backwards compatibility so that users
who don't want to have to swap out their
motherboards take advantage of all the
capabilities that arise in 3000 cpu
offers the
they don't have to do that they can just
use their existing boards and swap in a
new CPU or swap out their old CPU for a
new one and call it a day I'm gonna be
curious about cross compatibility but if
you could really take if you could
really get a 3000 series 12 core let's
say and drop it into a be 350
motherboard and have like I'd be pretty
impressed by that big damn right that's
and then what well well done amazingly
if you're not sacrificing much in terms
of I'd be curious of course about
performance but if you're just talking
about something that you want to run at
stock speeds right yeah I'm sure there's
numerous tests about that and that'll be
really interesting of course AMD is not
just you know not taking the opportunity
to cash in on some new products they are
they have an upcoming x5 70 board line
of boards that carry new features over
to Rison 3000 series SKUs but but yeah
the option is the the whole idea here is
flexibility and upgrade ability as
opposed to buying into an entirely new
sort of ecosystem um let's see the
creator of the rise in DRAM calculator
speculates that there are a couple
features that might ship with Rison 3000
series CPUs I'm not gonna read all of
them but the main ones include the CCD
or compute core design which is
basically the new name for CCX
so that's not really a new feature just
a this is a similar feature a same
feature under a different name support
for a maximum of 32 threads which would
confirm 16 core parts as many people
have been speculating awesome and
that'll be pretty sweet there's a bunch
of others that are a bit more obscure
that'll let you guys you know check out
the article on wucf Tech 4 but that's
all for a rise in 3000 news we can move
on to an article from the hot hardware
this has been circulating the web as of
yesterday I believe about Google
announcing there's a dia steady daddy
daddy I see I didn't watch the actual
press event I didn't know this so I
don't know how it's pronounced Stadium I
would pretend like Stadium so stadia
stadia yeah
yeah I think so things like the most
American way to pronounce that word but
they did Haiti but they did have an
event so I'm sure they pronounced it
there so it's totally impossible it's so
they possible we're doing it wrong
true study yeah
it's a stupid control used by Mario it
looks just like a freakin like a like a
blue there's a bluetooth
like Android PC compatible controller
that's like 50 bucks that looks exactly
like that yeah I wouldn't be surprised
if they just like oh yeah mid or
something but it looks really cheap and
basic but I mean I don't care so much
about how it looks as as compared to how
it feels like as long as it feels good
it could be the ugliest controller in
the world it can be it could be an egg
you know but if it if my if my fingers
loved it my palms palms are sweaty mom's
sphaghetti then I'm I'm all over it
ready ready so what's what's what's the
deal with this it's a it's a 4k 60fps
streaming service that's using Google's
servers so you know basically there's
all the offloaded processing and they're
actually contracting AMD they're doing a
partnership with AMD to make custom GPUs
for for their servers which is pretty
interesting they're saying that the does
it have does this article have info on
the processor because there was some no
there were some questions floating
around about that for instance if you
look at this this during the
presentation it says custom x86
processor and it says hyper threaded
which is normally that's an Intel 3
right simultaneous multi-threading of
course a lot of people say hyper
threading is a generic term for
simultaneous multi-threading because it
was around for so long before there was
anything else yeah
but they also say a B X 2 which is
terminology that generally you'd hear
from AMD Intel would say avx-512
probably so I don't know I I'm only
saying this based on some stuff I saw
earlier today on Twitter yeah kind of
curious about that but if they
is providing the GPU then I could see
this being something where they're doing
a complete hardware solution right who
knows but I'm sure we'll find out at
some point and I mean it makes sense too
because I think Amy's probably already a
step closer to doing something like this
because they already have chips in like
ps4 and Xbox and stuff like that but I
suppose we'll find out more details in
the future there's also the ability to
stream games not just from your TV but
like seamlessly transition your game
streaming from the TV to a mobile device
smartphone tablet any compatible device
really it's supposed to be just a really
seamless process kind of reminds me of
like the Nintendo switch being able to
go from one device to another that'd be
pretty cool well I mean so that it's
we're talking about games running
remotely that are being streamed to you
yes my GeForce now or so there there
have been services like this in the past
but we're talking about up to 4k 60 did
you already say that I did my I did I
mean that's so that's very ambitious
that's pretty crazy so that they're
doing interesting things here in order
to get that level of resolution as well
as response time yeah there's a lot
there's a lot going on under the hood I
think here yeah not that I can explain
it any deeper than that I apologize I'm
only sort of loosely caught up with this
story today yeah well they don't really
go into much detail as to how they're
able to pull this off it's supposed to I
saw something about like it having the
response time somehow being better than
an Xbox one X or something like that
very weird to me yeah that doesn't seem
right
compute performance sums all right maybe
maybe that's there's a magic never never
mind what I said there that's I mean
that would be silly anyway right maybe
I'm just going back to stuff I saw
people posting that on Twitter earlier
today anyway but anyway um this the sort
of platform here is kind of interesting
it's it's talking about certain things
that I haven't really heard other
competing platforms mention yet for for
example and a lot of this has to do with
Google's own hardware for example you
can stream
on a chromecast or a pixel device along
with along with a Chrome browser if you
wanted to so that's kind of interesting
you could purchase games straight from a
YouTube or twitch stream so I guess if
you saw like your favorite streamer
playing apex legends there'd be like a
click to buy like oh I want to play that
game and you can just like buy it
straight from it it's free to play ok ok
well Jesus let's give an example by the
Battle pass or maybe you could click to
download started today we'll be
discussing that on my half of the show
you shameless motherfuckers sorry I was
just trying to do it early way to steal
my thunder so it's kind of cool I think
what's even more interesting is that you
could actually like join somebody's game
if you will if you're watching someone's
stream and of course they're gonna have
to like allow permissions for any random
person to just join their match but if
you happen to be watching your favorite
streamer and they're opening it up to
like its sub Sunday and you know anyone
who's viewing in chat can actually join
me in this match this battle royale
whatever there's like a single button
you can press on this new controller
that'll basically allow you to join I'm
sorry that's that buttons for if you
want to stream yourself so if you if
you're wanting to stream but there's
gonna be like interactive buttons on
like the YouTube player for example or a
twitch player that'll let you jump in to
a match just in real time which is kind
of interesting you can also use a USB
controller if you don't like the super
rounded one that Google is launching
okay well that's all apparently he gives
you options it's it's called the Nadia
or no no it's named after the same
service why can't I read like bad yet
stay the speediest ad is study
controller so that's that's wireless
that's gonna be connecting wirelessly
and directly to your current gaming
session on Google servers
that's via Wi-Fi and it controls
actually on screen
let's see Google says that a little
scale that the platform will scale
eventually to 8k 120 FPS but damn you
know when they say in the future it
could be you
years down the line since there aren't
many native 8k panels in people's homes
right now that's probably yes very
forward-looking
yeah um the Google's also announced
partnerships with some top game engines
including unity and real one with
collaborations with developer it'd it's
software some doom up the neck mmm nice
Google will have its own game studio as
well study games and entertainment which
will produce exclusive titles so there
will be exclusive titles to the platform
ones that you can't find anywhere else
and that that's what exclusive means
it's apparently gonna launch this year
which is also very ambitious in in the
US Canada UK and across Europe okay it's
launching in Italy first Italy first
because it's so what do you think about
this Paul out of the the other services
that have popped up similar to this does
it sound any more or less promising I
mean the 4k 60 I mean so much of it
depends really comes down to your
personal internet connection Google can
set up everything to be super awesome if
you have a bad internet connection then
you're not gonna have a good experience
I wonder what kind of connection you're
gonna have to have like what I thought
it was 25 megabit didn't it say that I I
think you might have read a different
article that maybe just know there's
quite a bit of discussion of this today
okay well maybe this is this is the
first this is the only thing I read
about it is this one hot heartburn
you're probably right and that would
also bring into question you know like
you people who have data caps and stuff
like that which I mean for some people
that's an issue for some people not at
all so that's that's gonna be a shrew
that'll be a question to be answered but
yeah I don't know personally I like I
like running games on local hardware yet
we'll have to see yeah I appreciate what
you're doing here but I think it's gonna
be like VR where it's like gonna be a
cool thing but we're not quite there yet
we're not gonna be fully ready for it
for another few years eventually it'll
probably I think it'll probably take
over years and years you know maybe a
decade or so down the line but for now
it's it's just like still in its infancy
but we'll see heroes licking his
butthole
you didn't looking like for why I've
never here oh no started here here Oh
here are your being that's gratuitous
hero hero you must taste really good do
you think very highly of yourself don't
you no he's nice embarrassed now he's
coming over
oh geez uh his name too many times by
the way this beer just was a good it's
it's supposed to be sour right no it's a
red ale that's what I thought peanut
alert red ale why is it it's very sour
it's very tart oh it's very tert very
tart okay almost like a red sour but I'm
just I'm hoping that I haven't been
drinking like a spoiled beer according
to the writing on the back of this
uh-huh our founder set out to brew the
perfect beer it smells like beer to me
it's unique
I wouldn't say unique and perfect or
synonymous this nutty ale creates a new
classic with its smooth and natural
peanut rich flavors there's no ifs ands
or nuts about it this is it it's just
it's sour
that's ours our layered you just try a
sip
hmm is that do you think that's
intentional I don't know I'm gonna die
beers that are sitter that that are have
that kind of flavor you don't they bad
do you think I'm safe yeah yeah like a
yeah shrug like a hammock man you know I
mean I got we've got other beer like why
couldn't it why couldn't this have been
the beer that I that I worked in my eye
you know and wasted half a bottle I'd
have to be a nice bottle of blue shimei
can always sink into the abyss the abyss
the other one was barely bear Allegiant
tequila and bourbon barrels peal stet
was I was black strap molasses I was
good
licorice with cherry bark and hold
vanilla beans I got that one on
Craigslist I feel like we need that's
that's that we need to start the show
with that and when we drink that yet I
feel this beers more dangerous do you
want to do it grab your different
winning no no I'll finish it alright
standard hopefully I always finish what
I start Paul including this segment so
let's move on now you are next article
from tech power up let's get a little
hot in here
yeah you are I think the beers kicking
in it's called after shock after shock
Zachary Smith now that it's called
peanut alert Peaks I don't like the
alert Park noise it's my neighbor
oh here's drinking water and my neighbor
started to use a saw right at the exact
same time it was a really weird sound
okay your dog has a soft 1659 tea
16:50 leaked unexpected what a shocker
this is actually a leak that comes from
a Eurasian Economic Commission filing or
eec filing this common place yeah
anything happened before but revealed a
lot of details about the card that a lot
of us excuse me
already kind of knew was coming this in
particular is featuring an MSI gaming X
custom design card and as a picture
seems to be that it's not my source is
video cards so okay we have a picture of
it they have this thing look at that oh
look at that this is just others there's
where the writing is we're in all the
pictures geforce gtx 1650 it's i mean
it's like a shipping manifest or
something so I added another link but
this one there yeah yeah well I don't
know if that's the GTX sheriff that's
probably over 16 1660 let's just pretend
10 that's the 1650 okay for theatrics
the gaming X version the gaming ax
version yes so this is gonna be on the
12:00 nanometer tu 117 silicon which is
Nvidia smallest based on Turing and we
are confirming with the filing here that
the cards getting four gigs of memory
doesn't say if it's gddr5 I would
speculate it is probably four gigs yeah
I mean this is probably gonna be
targeted at like eSports gamers you know
who don't really need a ton of
horsepower but are looking for a cheaper
card and it's probably gonna compete
with anarch's 570 maybe an RX 580 dad
that would be pretty cool an RX 580
maybe RX 580 okay I mean maybe
I mean maybe maybe if you get
overclocked it maybe it gets a little
close yeah we'll see it is sub 200
supposed to be sub 200 bucks and the
the speculated AMD price drop for the RX
580 is supposed to be $1.99 so the 1660
was $220 so yeah I would you know exact
you've got to give it room for the 1650
and then they like the slightly special
versions of the 1650 that are like 10 or
20 bucks more without quite being as
much as the 1660 maybe 179 buck 79
perhaps one 15999 base price in video
that's what I want
one $59.99 yeah that's gonna yeah that's
if it's gonna compete in arts 570 I
would say that's a pretty fair price
because they've got our x58 he's going
for well below 200 bucks now 171 172
just everywhere so wildfire that would
be it would be a very valid competitor
again assuming that performance is there
if we're talking RX v 7t r RX 580 level
performance yeah the the memory would be
a severe limitation to anything but
beyond 1080 i think but for a lot of
people that's okay and yeah it would be
crazy more efficient than the RX 580 or
five seventy that would be like one of
the big benefits there the reason that
actually probably that's the that's
probably the best reason why this isn't
a picture of an actual 1650 is because I
yeah or even just for the base model
just straight from the PCB or I'm sorry
the motherboard the PCIe slot perhaps
depending depending on how how efficient
we can go late April that's in a month
month ish okay that's all that's all for
tech news yay
we have one more segment on my half and
it's an exciting one
I like exciting segments Kyle it's
interactive too it's ask the audience
the audience where we ask you three
questions you answer them honestly or
it's no or it's not five
and then Paul and I have to guess what
your answers were and whoever gets the
closer answer wins whoever gets the
further away answer has to take a drink
this is I'm glad we have an ASL
translator for all of my words still
learning I'm very good pretty sure you
got strop hold accurate
all right sorry are we asking our
audience first question first question
here and cell feel free to paste these
in chat I lovely moderator sell everyone
sell is the best isn't he beautiful
thank you look at him look at him strut
look at him alright so the first
question is what kind of drive does your
primary PC boot from so I don't think
we've asked this one before so I want to
know are people booting from mechanical
hard drive still are they using SATA
SSDs or have they made the upgrade and
put the bullet and gone nvme so there's
three options here there's there's quite
a few other you know more niche or
obscure options that you could
potentially boot from but these are the
three main ones I would say and the
majority of you are probably booting
from at least one of these so go ahead
and fill that out Paul and I will
postulate and so we're just gonna guess
which one is the most true do we have to
like guess the split I was thinking you
could pick one and then guess the
percentage think we should guess the
split you can guess the split yeah split
would be exciting
I could double double drinks or nothing
something really I'll give me double
drinks or nothing right yeah you know
we're getting Thai food for dinner Oh
God all right so while you guys do that
we're gonna go on to the next question
give you guys a minute to vote so the
next question is very serious who would
look prettiest in a dress and I've got a
couple of notable youtubers up here okay
we've got Paul Kyle Linus Jay Demetri
Wendell who would look prettiest in a
dress
prettiest alright so prettiest could be
interpreted I feel like it's been open
to interpretation like like who looks
the most awful in a dress it can be like
the opposite or like who maybe has the
most feminine features and would look
most natural in a dress you could take
it more literally so I guess it's really
just up to the audience so that's it's
also part of it I said I was thinking
more of like a wholesome pretty you know
like like like what a pretty dress
versus like pretty woman pretty you know
follow me here man not quite you lost me
a pretty woman nevermind what yes okay
evening here's that's a tough call it's
a tough call are we gonna every every
talkin over the third question yet are
we going back to the first I say we go
back to the first and then we talk about
the third question okay all right so
what kind of drive does your okay so you
give us a split Paul what you think is
the most all right I'm thinking
mechanical hard drives still gonna be
pretty low but we'll have some
representation so I'm gonna get 15% okay
to the mechanical hard drive that leaves
me a hundred and twenty percent left
weigh 120 no I'm sorry my math is I
proved last week that my mouth is
horrible by being off by a hundred oh my
factor of 100
so it's a hundred fifteen percent of the
mechanical hard drive okay I'm thinking
the majority is gonna be on SATA SSD but
you know we have a lot of enlightened
viewers so that I think we're gonna have
more nvme users than you might expect
here okay so I'm gonna give 30% to the
nvme I think you know I'm thinking we're
just shy of a third okay I have people
on that so that leaves 55% for your SATA
SSD okay all right I'm gonna switch
things up here I'm just gonna go a
different direction I'm gonna say I'm
gonna say 30% mechanic
okay I think 30% mechanical so about a
third of you are still on mechanical and
then I'm gonna say 10% real quick Dodger
Gigi who just posted in chat that when
nvme is as cheap as say - he will switch
I just want to point out that the the
mini build I built back here
I used two Intel 660 series nvme SSDs
because the price per gigabyte was
cheaper than any other standard SATA
hard drive it was a hundred and twenty
bucks for a one terabyte and it was 220
bucks for the two terabyte this better
price per gig for the two terabyte
although there's a bunch of it there's I
saw at least one a one terabyte SATA SSD
for $100 today yeah I've seen so she
knows pop those in there it's awesome
I'm like oh yeah we finally have really
affordable there's a present that
happened on an intel SSD - yeah all
right so it's it's qlc and so it's not
really good like extended writes yeah
it's it's still very good SSD and then
and you know but better perform
measurably better performance no editing
but yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't use it um
just it's extended rates can be slower
yeah
alright so I'm gonna say 30% mechanical
15% nvme and then 55% SATA set one more
time
30% mechanical 15% nvme and 55% SATA
okay that checks out right checks out oh
wow oh wow
holy crap I was way I you do win one you
did you do you do when I was only five
percent off with the mechanical that was
a little nvme is increasing even more
that must be people purchasing that
Intel installing I can't believe how
many nvme users their data is a mirror a
mirror have 51 percent that's not really
amazing it's such a this is such an
enlightening segment it really is you
know you get to learn a little bit about
each other
alright hey we did say that we were
gonna learn something about ourselves we
did let's jump to question 3 question 3
remember that real quick I'm also very
serious and controversial will actually
do you possess the self-control to get
option 1 - exactly 68% when Paul and
Kyle view the poll results Wow and this
is this is like a social experiment it
really is it's a social experiment on
you guys we want option 1
yes exactly 50% I feel like in this case
I can vote sure just wow so we got a
hundred percent right now I'm the only
person who's right so by the time we go
back to this and look at the results it
has to be 68 the viewers have to have
enough self-control to not push it over
is too serious do you know those guys
wow that's already all right go back
switch back switch em back
happening - we can't sir we can't watch
it too much ok so now we can go dear
faith in you everyone 68 baby don't you
dare don't go over 1 but more
importantly who would look prettiest in
a dress who would look prettiest in a
dress me you - Jay Dmitri Windell so
they're just gonna we gotta call the
winner here right yeah okay and bonus
points you can get the percentage close
okay like all right I gotta go with my
heart here and I gotta say Dmitri and
that's P that's purely because I don't
know if that's me and I say this in the
most like like like I'm married and
about to have a kid way possible
Dimitri's he's a good-looking guy yes
he's a good-looking guy he's fit and
he's in shape that's another I think
that's another factor there I was gonna
say I was gonna say lightest cuz - you
know he's he plays his badminton
badminton this is squash or whatever he
plays you drop a ball too much yeah I'm
gonna go to me tree yeah yeah he's 13
pretty good 29% of the vote I guess yeah
I'm - me tree looks pretty all the time
no matter what he's wearing so okay I'm
[Laughter]
alright not that there's anything wrong
no no absolutely not I am gonna say
I'm gonna say J I think J would look
prettiest in a dress
because you know there's been that trend
lately where a lot of like girls women
are like dyeing their hair like silver
or like almost bleach white J already
has that like he like set that trend so
he already kind of has the trendy hairs
kind of very fashionable he has very
defined jaw bone structure in his face
it's true I think just like a model like
he's got that chiseled jawline and he's
been working out - I know he's been
working out he's lost a lot of weight
and he's looking good I think he would
own it - literally he would totally come
see you're doing the J face attitude you
have to be confident with that sort of
thing so I wasn't man but then I digress
[Laughter]
what's your percentage results - Wow 50%
oh my god damn people just want to see
you lioness in a dress he's you're all
sick he's very live live that's that's
the word I was gonna use you very live
live a life LOL i th e i think that's
the right word I'm thinking of right I
don't even know what that means okay I
know I've heard it I just don't member
supple and graceful vocabulary live that
is true chat - his voice really would
sell the dress yeah I have to agree
limber nimble deft spry flexible plant
okay and finally so wait who wins who
wins there
so I said Dmitri with 29% he's at 12 and
I said Jay with he said to you yeah
drink up buddy
juice and then our last question which
is more of an experiment is were you
guys able to get option 1 - exactly 68%
or did you fail like the worthless
suckers you are we're drinking this
we're going for it all right
all right this is basically yes you
think yes or no or no they won't get it
all right
you knew first I'm gonna say yes I have
faith I have faith in the audience I
think you know the the forces of K I
think the forces of order will overcome
the forces of chaos okay in this in the
circumstance well then you have forced
me to have zero faith in our in our
audience and I will say no they
definitely didn't pull it off every chat
here comes oh I thought it was gonna be
like at least a percent or two off yeah
I mean an chat people are still fighting
though I see votes coming in the battle
was waging still you know and maybe in
the future
valiant perhaps in the future maybe this
is just something that time you know
we'll revisit because you didn't say
that in the title do you possess that
the wind pollen category they're mine
everything I did all factors were were
accounted for so nice track Johnny lose
Gigi okay that concludes my half of the
show my shitty half guys I thought it
was good my thank you Paul
