yeah more or less yeah good enough for
me
what's going on guys welcome back this
is side B have awesome hardware episode
163 the date is September 25th we never
read off the date you know yeah and we
start doing that it really dates the
show though
really hmm very literal well that was so
nice that that's why we're so good he's
like a double entendre I think no it's
not it's just just literally I'm reading
into it too far clearly but welcome back
welcome back or welcome for the first
time if you're just joining us the first
half of the show today's episode was
streamed on Paul's YouTube channel if
you weren't catching us on Twitch so you
can actually head there if you're
watching this after the fact after the
live broadcast you can go to his channel
youtube.com slash the beginning it's
like the prequel it will show all the
backstory to explain how we got to where
we are now
yeah you want a couple you won't
understand anything we're saying if you
don't watch his half first and that's
also linked in the description below
this is a tech news show in case you're
new here that we do every single Tuesday
at 5:30 p.m. Pacific Time and we like to
have a few drinks so if you are joining
us on that Chia's thanks for being here
um we occasionally use adult language so
if you are not cool with that you've
been warned adult language warning too
friggin bad yeah what else stores you
can buy things from our stores how does
this show your trailer half-caf no no I
got it looks like you have a long holy
I'm totally high no idea fine but it
went by so quickly bit way tech is my
store you might Bertrand ice there
there's mouse pads hoodies shirts bottle
openers glasses lots of stuff it's all
very high quality same you'll find on
Paul store which is Paul's hardware
dotnet we both go through the same
merchandise guy and we will yell Johnson
at you probably in our after party which
will happen more or less than about half
an hour
- 40 minutes from now so thank you very
much for for for supporting us in that
way and just for for joining us for the
show let's move on to tech news there's
a few stories to talk about here there
was anything super crazy happening this
week in the industry but we're gonna
we're gonna do our best to entertain you
guys here the first story is from PC
world our good friend and colleague
Gordon MA um who works there wrote this
article Thank You Gordon for this one at
PC world it's about new egg and the fact
that credit card information was stolen
from from from the old tech retailer and
this sophisticated heck yeah he's very
sophisticated it good yeah it's like
they were old pinkies up you know they
had a monocle they're probably wearing
monocles and so we need the classic the
classic picture of like the hacker with
the top hat whatever on but he's guys
gonna be wearing with like a nice suit
or something he looks like the planters
peanut guy so he's still got the beanie
over his head but nice suit
sophisticated attack it's very chic
balaclava it was it was skimming
people's credit card information during
the checkout process right I believe so
yes yeah exactly during the checkout
process you know well first off the the
New Age servers were we're basically
injected with a bit of malware is one of
their servers okay yeah one one so
there's one it's all took so this is
important that like talking about a
company like New Ager whatever they they
don't have a single server that everyone
is connecting to they have multiple
servers so it only takes one parent Lee
the hacker only had to get into one of
them so it was only people who are
connected to that specific server that
would have been compromised I guess
so so there are still some people who
are safe i I I would imagine in that
sense but but you don't know you don't
know if you are a snoo it has
proactively gone and contacted the
people who were compromised which I
don't know if they have done I feel like
I bought something from them cuz all
right here's the deal isn't it was found
that all this credit card information
was being sent to a domain that was
registered as new egg stats calm and
that domain was actually registered on
August 16th so customers from that data
on who purchased from new egg starting
from August 16th Ford
are likely affected but like Paul said
since it was only one server that was
hacked or attacked
we don't really know who's safe and
who's not so it's just best to assume
that you've been compromised in some way
it's always best to assume that you've
been affected if you better say sorry
made a purchase like made a purchase
doing that date so and also double check
your emails and stuff to see if new
wakes reached out to you I think I made
a purchase from Newegg since that date
and I have not received any contact from
them I don't know it doesn't mean it's
for everyone and also this doesn't just
affect you know your credit card
information being stolen it also has the
potential to affect pre-orders
I actually saw Wendell tweet about this
is how I picked up on this news story in
the first place what Wendell from level
1 Tex he tweeted that Newegg had
actually canceled his r-tx 20 atti order
his pre-order because his card was
stolen but Newegg never reached out to
Wendell and said hey can we get a
replacement credit card do you have a
valid credit card that we can still that
way we can still get your order through
they just straight up cancelled it and
didn't tell him and so now he's he's got
to wait a lot longer for a 22 TI to
arrive so he was wasn't too too thrilled
about that so it's actually affecting
you know people in multiple ways but
yeah this this is the if you want to
give credit to these assholes
there was a very similar attack by the
same group against British Airways and
Ticketmaster the hacking group is known
only as some stupid name it's like
really you couldn't have come up with
something I didn't write it down because
it was so stupid just just for the
record Cal is the one who's throwing out
insults at the hacking group mage cart
what a stupid awful name I'm just asking
for it no I whatever it makes sense
because you know their majors like they
do magic they like do hacks and stuff
and a shopping in your shopping cart
digital card so you know I take back
everything I said I love you guys you
know like cheers you're doing doing the
Lord's work my friend hacking is
a gift to all of us and it should be it
should be praised
so don't know need to know need to look
at my pages anytime soon all right
cubot hope hope everyone's information
safe out there uh use two-factor
authentication everyone there you I
don't know how to pronounce this manly
manly I want to say manly mommy cause
that on me I think there's only two
possibilities modeling where you put the
accent and the other manly or a modeling
bond lean on lean manly is it motley or
monthly it's where you put the accent
and the emphasis where are they located
what how you put the pronunciation Asia
and Middle Eastern Asia and Middle East
is the market they usually dominate um
but anyway regardless of how to
pronounce their name I'm just gonna say
manly cuz it makes me happy
this is GPU board partner who has just
announced their RT X xx atti in 2080
Gallardo yeah I got okay it's a double L
and I'm thinking it's like Spanish maybe
yeah because you've got right because
you've got what is that word from like
like the Lamborghini there's a
Lamborghini Gallardo I believe so I
don't know I guess that means it's fast
I don't know what Gallardo's means in
whatever language that is at any rate
we're talking about the cars here
you can see that it's got a pretty
premium looking you know triple fan
heatsink design you're right what
there's a Lamborghini right oh yeah fact
checking me bro its fact check it means
from 2014
let's go say night 562 horsepower yet
obviously sold it's all common knowledge
I was born with a jeweled tank capacity
of 23.8 yellen's see if so gay oh yeah
yeah you're right now it's Italian it's
Italian sorry it's the type of bulls as
Samwise thank you Sam so it's
interesting
Denis McGee our dough we our dough when
they're not when they don't service the
European market anyway he was a trying
to evoke
the name of the Lamborghini girl perhaps
there were some crossover there's better
marketing insinuate that the card is
fast like fast and sports
luxurious anyway for its it's pretty
decent looking car doesn't look terrible
or anything it looks like it's got some
aluminum plated shroud elements gold
silver and black for as far as the color
scheme is just like a Trojan shogen
Spartan thing a helmet helmet no I it's
it looks like a logo they're just sort
of playing with I don't I don't know if
that's like their actual logo I think
they just created that logo just
specifically for this line of cards
there's RGB lighting who knew and
they've they've also designed a blower
fan
RTX 2080 that i don't care about and you
shouldn't either unless you really need
a blower fan style
RTX 2018 possible you might need it just
it's not sure how quiet it would be or
cool I might be interested if it
actually costs $600 yeah 700 wait what's
it yes yeah
yup six these will probably not hit
retailers in Asia or the Middle East
till mid October but there's also no
pricing on here I'm probably in some
currency we don't simply I'm beginning
review anyway ggc's there one in chat
who knows more about fancy sports cars
than we do says Gallardo's Spanish every
Lamborghini card has been a famous bull
name and they're all in Spain see I said
I said first thing I said was a chat
someone in chat said that so most I
deserve a cashew yeah so um oh just
thought I'd point this out cuz you know
I feel like except Countach I was gonna
say is a Countach is a type of bullet
the Lamborghini Countach lemme sounds
like a swarm what'd you say what vagina
like to settle in to no one else
somebody else must have no I definitely
get where you're coming from come to
every time trying to make it vulgar Kyle
oh it's actually the name of the car yes
and that's how they sell it right yeah
pure sex 74 to 1990 was when they were
produced no can touch it oh that's the
name of that's clearly you know the most
iconic super cars of all time
manly should take some notes the r-tx
2080 Countach that would be there you go
that's that's successful yard Oh unless
it's trademarked by Lamborghini I didn't
know that bowls up and he had so many
different names I don't think this is a
bull name so no that's all except for
this car this was a unique and special
okay I don't know I mean where else it's
also like twitch chat so you know who
knows um Lamborghini Red Bull uh all
right so that's that's news that's
that's some news let's move on good idea
now you know there's a new graphics card
that exists PC gaming prices PC gaming
hardware prices are supposed to be
rising very soon if not immediately due
to the Trump tariffs that have come to
affect for the United States and it's
barely gonna get worse as this frickin
very clickbait headlines to suggests as
of yesterday this is from Dave James at
PC games n and on September 21st which
was four days ago you're watching this
live Trump finalized the tariffs on 200
billion dollars of Chinese imports and
gigabyte was seemingly the first one in
in the PC space to really speak out
about this with an announcement they
they said terribly effective September
24th yesterday 2018 and initially will
be an amount of 10% 10% 10%
perhaps 10% penalties on on all their
products now maybe not all their
products but all the ones you care about
really the products that have tariffs
enforced on them coming from China right
now the amount is 10% but it's supposed
to increase supposed to go up on January
1st I believe the 25% she's nuts and
gigabyte in their announcement their
little post there they actually listed
out all the parts that would be affected
fortunately you want to worry about like
keyboard and mice really keyboard and
mice are largely unaffected unless
they're bundled with PC parts like DIY
parts which is what is mostly affected
here everything from the motherboard to
the graphics card to the CPU cooler is a
CPU I don't see CPU there actually but
everything else in a system besides a
CPU everything else in a system that you
know the 7 or your opponents they're
talking specifically about the parts
that gigabyte will be terrified on that
gigabyte makes yes and gigabyte makes a
lot of different products yeah so CPUs
are I would I would I would assume
because all those parts are that it's
it's CPU xored in the exact exact same
category and that CPUs would also be
taxed the same so the entire build
essentially could get a 25% price hike
yes $1000 $1000 PC by January 1st could
potentially cost thousand hundred and no
one thousand twelve hundred and fifty
five hundred and fifty dollars if it
switches in a linear fashion and then if
you got to pay like freaking tax on that
still like my god
so I don't know it's also interesting
because the the article was saying that
that certain companies like maybe
gigabyte or ACS like the big dogs and
stuff that the big ad board partners
could potentially shift some of their
manufacturing over to Taiwan I don't
know how feasible that would be for them
if it if that would be even more
expensive but assuming let's just
hypothetically say that they could do
that gigabyte already has some mag
factories in Taiwan in Taiwan right
typically it's more expensive to produce
stuff in Taiwan than it is
mainland China right but it does seem
like these tariffs are only affecting
goods shipping it from mainland China
Renata I want Taiwan has a sort of
complicated and difficult to describe
relationship with well they with China
Taiwan Taiwan and China and also how the
u.s. views Taiwan I was under the
impression that US viewed Taiwan and
China is the same
that's China's policy they I think
officially they don't recognize Taiwan
as its independent they do not from a
governmental perspective but Taiwan is
very independent they have their own
government they have their own currency
and T vs versus steel on that that China
uses so they're very independent in a
lot of ways the US government does not
view them as independent from China
because they don't wanna piss off China
and that pisses off China when you try
to say Taiwan separate but economically
there's a lot of there's a lot of
economic stuff going on between the US
and Taiwan so the u.s. is a little bit
more protective I feel like of the
economic side than they are of the
government side and that's as far as I
want to go into it right now because
again it's a very complex situation and
I don't want to try to try to explain
something that I don't have any business
try to explain yeah point being though
if they can shift stuff to be imported
from Taiwan versus imported from
mainland China then there might be a way
to get around some of the tariffs but
there's limitations on just just volume
in size Taiwan is a much smaller
physical location it's an island off the
coast of China versus mainland China
itself and where a lot of the
manufacturing goes on there so the main
questions right now our will exceptions
be made there's a bunt there were a
bunch of people that put a big stinks
over certain tariffs going on with
imports and certain industries are able
to lobby the government to have changes
made or exceptions made those exceptions
made right now for notebooks for example
notebooks aren't from from China aren't
having the tariffs imposed on them but
components are supposed to be so this is
a weird situation where like if I buy a
whole computer is that
that mean that whole computer I can buy
and the parts will have been able to
have been imported tariff-free but if
I'm buying the individual parts those
will have tariffs on them systems
integrators who build the computers here
but import the individual parts from
China are in a very tough situation
right now because they're dealing with
the tariffs on the imports but you know
they still have to sell their hardware
and if you're if you're not sure how
this actually works the way the tariffs
work is is the company that the company
in the US that's buying the stuff from
China is who pays the terrorists so I've
had a few people who have said like yeah
stick it to China with the tariffs
that's not how it works you're sticking
to the US sticking it to the people in
the US us trying to sporting goods from
China right so yeah and and the other
thing is is that like it could further -
or further widen the gap between smaller
adding board partners for example versus
the larger ones if the smaller adding
board partners are not able to shift
over they're manufacturing over to
Taiwan for example and they're stuck
exclusively trying to export their shit
from China from mainland China then they
they might they might fall by the
wayside they might pull out of selling
to the US entirely maybe say alright you
know while these tariffs are going on
we're just gonna sell to like Asia and
the Middle East we're gonna we're gonna
follow manly you know with our dough and
shit and just say fuck the US so and so
so you might have more limited options
not just more expensive prices at the
other day but more limited than right
now maybe it'd be as much competition at
the end of the day as well so I don't
know there's there's a lot of ways it
could go it's probably gonna be bad
either way we just don't know how how
bad yeah you know there's the
theoretical numbers the the 10 percent
right now and the 25 percent come the
turn of 2019 but we don't know exactly
if that's gonna scale one to one with
the prices we'll see so we'll just have
to wait and see a lot of wait and see
all right all right moving mode on uh
AMD AMD is you know under the microscope
right now
have been checked out by well first off
this articles from mark Campbell I
thought it says mark Campbell at first
got excited I was like oh he's in the
tech oc3 net this is a I guess this was
discovered by some Linux enthusiasts at
fir onyx who discovered a new Polaris
part was in AMD's latest AMD GPU Linux
kernel patches this was known as or
listed as 0x6 FDF which has not popped
up before so it indicates a new SKU and
now there are rumors of a potential
Polaris Polaris 30 GPU launching which
would I guess there were previous rumors
of this and now they're sort of
resurfacing because of this discovery
not much is known here some some people
are speculating that this will be more
or less a refresh of the rx 580 for
example where we might see something
like an rx 680 that just has some you
know sort of Jen over gen you know 12
nanometer performance uplift maybe
around 10 to 15% I think people are
suggesting around a 15% improvement in
performance over in rx 580 which would
outpace the GTX 1066 gigabyte model sure
and it could probably you know knowing
AMD that will price it hopefully they
can price it fairly to make it more
competitive with the 1060 um so it's
kind of like one of those things where
it's like you know more competitions
always good but I also feel like this
isn't really what enthusiasts need right
now is it competitor to the 1060 I feel
like what I would be looking for from
AMD desperately especially now is like
competition in the higher-end space
maybe with you know sticking it to the
the RT X 2080 or even the RT X 2070 you
know I feel like that the 27 t like Paul
was saying like that's usually that that
70 skew from Nvidia has always been that
sort of bang for the buck option where
you get the best price performance and
you know you have enough bankroll to to
sort of throw down on a 1070 versus or a
70 SKU versus little money left over for
the rest of your system that's right so
I feel like that's much more of an
accessible card that still delivers
incredible performance that a lot of
people are really seeking you know with
just high refresh rates and high
resolutions that you know hyper 10 as
Aleutians and stuff like that so I would
have liked to see I would have liked to
see a little bit more from AMD right now
but at the same time I wasn't really
expecting to I was expecting more of
this of maybe something more in the
mid-range
entry level that would still be a great
card still probably gonna be perfectly
fine and you know could be even a better
deal than the gtx 1066 gig but you know
it still it still leaves invidia as the
only player in the high-end game which i
really you know it's like how it's the
same same deal with intel you know intel
is the only player in the high-end cpu
space until Rison came out and really
gave them a run for their money so I'd
like to see that same sort of
competition brought on that side but be
nice there you go
you guys let me know what do you think
do you care
yeah or is it like super stud are you
excited
like what do you think how you feeling
not particularly because it's existing
architecture you know it's it's the
slight die shrink but not a massive one
the seven nanometer stuff is what I'm
most anticipating Navi
to actually have an impact on the hand
and maybe maybe show in video some
competition you know right now there's
already somewhat reasonable competition
in the mid-range
I mean having something a little bit
faster than an RX 580 would I mean
that's nice
it'll be nice to have as another option
but it's less exciting compared to
something that will actually compete
with NVIDIA with the stuff that they're
currently launching the RT X series
which they feel comfortable enough
launching at crazy prices that are
higher than any GPU series has launched
about that before right that's that's
aimed at a consumer market yeah so Reed
badges are always like okay now this
exists that I don't know to me I never
get super excited about them so I don't
know maybe
to wait for another year and that's
something I feel like AMD's always a
year behind Nvidia in the GPU space if
not more
they're always a year behind that they
said there we're gonna have something 7
nanometre yeah is you by the end of this
year yeah but I mean I feel like it was
phrased in such a way that they also
said I don't know Elsa said Vega was
first gonna launch like at the end of
2015 or something so yeah
Green assault I guess yeah all right
well that's pretty much no no there's
one more little thing here sorry you
have two more little two more things
some somewhat good news here from
overclocked 3d once again there are some
good SSD prices right now so basically I
would just this is really quick just
just to give you guys a heads up go go
by these SSDs now because pretty soon
they could be a lot more expensive with
all the US tariffs if you were in the
United States if you're not in the
United States then that doesn't apply to
you but this is our super collect 3d
article from the UK yeah exactly because
the u.s. is screwed but some of these
prices are really good you know that the
cost per gigabyte for foreign and flash
storage is just dropped significantly
yeah over the last few months and some
of these options here they've listed the
the Kingston si 400 the SanDisk SSD plus
and the crucial bx 500 these are all
fairly budget oriented drives they're
not the fastest on the market by any
means or still say they're ev3 based and
even by those standards they're not like
you know on the samsung 970 evo type
levels or whatever but they're still
significantly faster and perform much
better than like your standard
mechanical hard drive and if you're
looking for an entry-level or even a
mid-range system throw an SSD in there
to get some faster load times then this
is like just I wouldn't just if you need
it buy it right now because they're
really dirt cheap even in the u.s. right
now I check the amazon.com the US Amazon
prices for these three SKUs earlier
today and they're about as cheap as they
are here in the UK so that's good news
and they've got sort of a range here you
can go even all the way up to the
the 960 gig SSDs I saw them as a 960 gig
SSD I saw as cheap as like 130 bucks so
pretty impressive this is a 480 gig I
switched it to us prices yeah oh okay
don't reveal any details I got all my
nudes you know uploaded to the Amazon
that's all great 480 but yeah nice 500
gig class SSDs for like 80 bucks 85
bucks that's a it's really nice yeah I
mean I've been looking forward to the
point when SSDs were like a cheap
commodity item where it's so she's like
I just throw 500 gig SSD in there yeah
it's cheap yep
whatever ideally we'll get to a point
where like one terabyte SSDs are even
more viable yeah but so cool and then
our final story for today before we dive
into pimp my PC this is an article from
our good friend Anthony from tweet town
he was one of the the only people that I
could find to report on just a
smorgasbord of leaked pictures featuring
brand-new Zee 390 motherboards from Asus
I think they're all from Asus there's a
lot of boards here so I'm gonna just
quickly go over them in order of
appearance was critical at the top sorry
if there's any ads that play on the
tweak town site they they are pretty ad
heavy at times aka all times you block
the okay great the ROG Maximus 11 code
which I believe is the first port up
there no I'm sorry yeah yeah this is the
code it's got a massive vrm heatsink and
you can see that it's it's kind of
following the theme of you know Intel
mainstream boards with four dimm slots
and it looks very much kind of like I
think the lower half reminds me of like
the rampage 6 extreme board that sort of
cover plate it's been illuminated and
stuff the giant I guys I'm brushed
aluminum plating there's RGB up the
wazoo you can see it's all over the eye
of cover that that bracket and you can
see that I'm glad they stopped putting
the
g/b unlike the clasps for the PCIe
instead it just looked tacky
yeah Santa's got Steve's got our Chatham
RGB and then even a surface mount of
power and resets got some RGB there
that's kind of cool
that's the first time I've ever seen
configurable surface mounted power of
LEDs to be honest and then we've also
got I counted up the fan headers on that
board seven fan headers no visible n dot
2 slots I'm sure there's plenty and this
is the RG Maximus 11 so this is not the
code this is the anti code some
differences here is the first off it's
black and white and I also don't know if
this is RGB or if has any illumination
it's kind of hard to tell from this
picture obviously but there's definitely
a sort of a black and white theme going
on here which is kind of new for Asus in
recent years I haven't really seen many
boards in there asus rog sort of lineup
though the prime their private Prime's
yes it's been all but I mean just for
this sort of ROG style board definitely
not so it's pretty cool I like it you
know um
if you if you want to do some black and
white it's very color neutral you can
still mix in a third a third colour
their primary color and there may be a
VRM waterblock yep from ek nonetheless
and it's a similarly huge heatsink that
we saw on the code board um so yeah that
board looks good we don't have any
prices or anything like that and then
there's the Maximus 11 hero boards which
you know that one features a standard
sort of asus rog design kind of basic
probably cheap much cheaper I kind of
like what Asus has been doing for a
couple generations now where they take
sort of a design on the top and they
continue it come from the top left of
the board to the bottom right like these
kind of /yeah across the board because
the GPU is gonna fill in that gap right
yeah and so it still looks pretty
continuous and especially if you've got
you know some issues or a sink lighting
going on there with your GPU and your
board I'm sure you could make the whole
effect go across the whole entire thing
all of these have had a USB 3.1 gen2
port yep on them too so cool and then
that's pretty much it some other notable
mentions you want to quit oh yeah I was
Call of Duty themed one I'm sure that'll
you know ya hit with the cod fans black
ops the cod blopps is what it is what
for two blobs for coops for umm I got
kind of excited when I saw the asus
strix mini ITX board down there i don't
know if you can go over that one little
mini ITX board so there's another one
he's red I don't like the ones with the
text on here we go that this looks nice
even though there's a little text in the
car it's not very visible it's very
minimal
umm yes they're doing like they did
before then there's a there's a colorful
sticker and then there's also a non
colorful sticker in the box right you
can swap it out uh so yeah um this is
this looks very similar to all their
previous generations with that sort of
very silvery aluminum finish and you
can't go wrong can't go wrong with that
guy and then the RGB on the side I feel
about the RGB on the side but I don't
mind it I don't mind it but I'm not like
yeah it's nice yeah I mean that's not a
must-have yep uh and then the issues
Prime series let's just go to the Prime
series because the prime series which is
the more white boards that you were
mentioning Paul earlier those are
actually looking pretty cool that's what
they switch up to the design of those as
well
you can kind of see that it's got more
of a polygonal design sort of
geometrical polygon well I don't know
it's got a hex it looks like a stop sign
on the vram heatsink are the chipset
heatsink oh yeah but you know part of
your graphics card will cover that up
yeah I mean I like the way they look I
kind of like the the RGB element the
implementation there where it's kind of
just like this patch on both sides
that's kind of kind of different it's
like it matches with the geometrical
style oh yeah yeah it's like it's kind
of diffused or yeah right gradient or
something and you know it's always hard
to tell it's sort of gauge from these
pictures how the lighting and stuffs
gonna look in real life but I'm sure
we'll get our hands on looks like it's
exploding I don't like this one there's
an explosion is the center of the
motherboard this one gives me vertigo
I can't that it's yeah it's like you're
looking down at a pit pit of despair
sketchy so that's some z9b
is e3 90 AC Sergey and
instead of action for you guys cool um
all right let's move on to pin my PC
yeah we get to pin value openings
starting with math you need to update
your pet my PC for over here Oh
AMD rise in 1600 X's from Matthew he has
a risin 1600 X in aces crosshair hero 6
16 gigs of G scale 3200 speed shred in
RGB asus strix gtx 1070 and a DIY pc
case can't remember the model name and
an inner max AIO alright so that's the
library I haven't seen and that's the
lie bridge like that huh looks kind of
um ok Matthew uh I don't know there's a
lot of potential here but I think your
rig needs help in a couple different
ways
I think the ketchup and mustard though
that's that means bullseye right in the
middle of your system is ketchup and
mustard right there yeah you know might
as well get some extensions for your
graphics card as well your 24 pin that
would clean things up go with black you
go with white I see some white accents
in here like on that a oh and I also
think the red is kind of sticking out on
that SSD sticker so maybe peel that off
again does all aesthetic and whatnot and
of course subject to personal tastes if
you're gonna go as far as to peel off
the SSD sticker I would also say pull
your optical drive and see if you can
either do a wrap or a paint job on it
yeah it's that that sort of that
off-white that sort of off-white color
doesn't really that's like those sore
thumb the old school PC look but it
stands out a lot you know you've got a
what I think is an RGB controller you
Thermaltake that's just kind of chilling
in there too
yeah it's I mean it's probably you
probably just routed it over there and
placed it somewhere where it was
accessible but it doesn't look that
great yeah and I'm guessing I'm guessing
he did it because there's not much room
behind his motherboard
yes the DIY PC case so so I don't know
maybe you could put it under your
graphics card where it's just a little
bit more out of sight it's like and the
controller doesn't let me look that bad
it's just the cables coming out of it
so maybe stick that under your graphics
cards let's get some velcro tape this is
a two-way gtx 1070 configuration you
don't see 1070 sli much yeah I wonder if
he got one you know you must not have
watched my video and another one clearly
not a fan um but you know that's I'd
like I'd like to see a picture of the
entire case DIY PC I've had a few
experiences with and they haven't all
been positive so yeah you know this
could be something where a case upgrade
might give you some more options to work
with and everything I mean overall
system doesn't look bad at all this
picture looks worse because there's a
flash so it's making everything stand
out more the lights on and everything
doesn't look too bad so yeah a few of
these suggestions should help move you
along towards a system that is it's
pretty you can look at and be happy that
it's pretty yep thanks Matthew
Thank You Matthew next we have gay porn
stuntman nice he does all of his own
stunts doesn't make him gay though
just cuz he's a gay porn stuntman does
not make him gay he just sucks all the
dicks for for for the cinema I believe
what you should be saying is there's not
there's anything wrong with that there
is there's that there is but sure I'd be
kind of curious I'm kind of curious like
a day-to-day like if like I want to
watch a video that follows him around
with his job and everything like that
that'd be fascinating I'm actually
watching I think you could do it
tastefully anyway he's got an i7 6700k
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz ASUS
Maximus formula Maximus 8 formula gtx
980ti OC 970 evo 2 terabyte WD black 6
terabytes 6
I'm sorry 32 gigs of g.skill 32 hundred
megahertz memory the coarser a x86 TI
power supply Windows 10 and in a Corsair
obsidian 450d case
case master fan Pro RGB fans it's his
first build ever he wants crits to good
pitches criticism criticism cable
management alright let's give him all
the criticisms right off the bat um all
right you know I think this is a really
nice system honestly it looks very nice
it's very sexy
and I think that your cable management's
great on the backside for sure yeah and
the front side even it's pretty tight
the back looks better than the front for
some reason yeah it does
yeah you spent a lot of time back there
all those velcro ties and stuff it looks
very clean you can definitely see like
the routing sort of lanes that you you
figured out there but on the other side
I also want to point out he's either
doing some interior decorating or
something or that's like a kill room
he's got set up in the back oh that's a
Dexter kill room for obviously a kill
room so gay porn stuntmen has become
even more mysterious with this just
maybe that's a gay porn stuff that he's
doing over there alright so what I want
to feel like so sorry you're not gonna
like this answer gay porn stuntman but I
think you need to add some extensions
which will kind of cause you to have to
redo all of the pretty cable management
behind your motherboard yeah but I think
that's the only way it's gonna happen it
seems like you enjoy cable management at
the very least so you probably won't
mind so much doing it again because
you've already put the time in the first
time around I think it's gonna help the
look of your system so much more though
even just to get some like nice clean
black extensions but whether you go
paracord or you know what's what's PT PT
PT whether you go like the sort of
plastic key or the fabric route I think
either way what will boost the look of
your system tenfold because yeah yeah
they're black but they're also kind of
rubbery and kind of glossy there's that
heat shrink around there that nasty heat
shrink a big old heat shrink not my
favorite and it only stands out because
everything else in the system is pretty
really color matched so yes very black I
don't even mind the power supply sticker
because it's just that little speck of
red there yes it's not bad at all um and
everything else looks really good you
know I'm actually not opposed to the
sort of velcro straps around the tubes a
if it's done right looks like you've
done a pretty good job there oh I'm up
and out of the way yep and it's pretty
much it man you do that and you're solid
I think all right let's move on thank
you for your submission gay porn
Stephanie won't stop man that's what we
got John John the Clingman Johnny Johnny
core i5 8600 K gigabyte Z 370 Mini ITX
16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance Pro 1
terabyte hard drive a sapphire rx 588
gigabyte card and an NZXT 200 it's of
course a mini ITX case to house that a
little motherboard there no I think the
submission because I think it has so
much potential
um it already looks really clean but
there's just a couple little very minor
very easy to fix quick fixes that you
could you could add here to really amp
it up a notch
so for starters I love the fans I love
the case fans are those ll series they
they might be and I like that you've
also slapped one onto your CPU cooler
heatsink I think that's very
matchy-matchy that was a good call
I like the custom sleeved cables here
however I think the cable management for
your SATA cable in particular that one
case a the cable could maybe go
underneath that reservoir bar on your
case instead of crossing over it's
possible that's a USB 3 oh is it oh you
might be right
it fits a unit if it's a USB 3 it might
be too tall on the plug side to can't
get a right angle to go under that bar
which might be why it's like that I
could be wrong about this it's it's it's
hard to say Ben from the picture no
that's that's definitely possible but I
feel like even if it's USB 3 you can
bend it not even right angle but just
straight back like do a full 180 enhance
but that USB 3 cable is very malleable
and hats
you could definitely you could
definitely get that under there oh
that's USB that's definitely USB oh
thank you for that enhance zoom in a
little
so that's that's a 20 pin for your
mistake from far away it looks like it
could be anything so I would definitely
say you could try I think it's very
possible could you try theirs
also right-angle extensions I've seen
for usb3 that'd be a clean option that
could also be a potential choice there
but but honestly before any of that you
like you just you really need a new CPU
cooler yeah I mean maybe at least a
nicer heatsink you you can buy CPU
coolers that just have the heatsink and
then just slap that fan on there because
it's a really nice fan yeah stick with
the fan that's fine
speaking of fans I think you could use
some additional fans right any fans at
the front of the case there's any intake
here unless they're in front of the the
dust filter not that I can see so I did
find kind of peculiar because that would
bring the fan the blades closer to the
front panel which would cut them off
here for airflow a bit more than if they
were inside the actual frame we have
negative pressure so I I don't know I
think I don't think you necessarily need
to buy more l-series RGB fans or
anything like that but just some healthy
airflow going to your video card
especially because that GPU is so close
to the shroud of the power supply I
think it could use some additional lift
there but apart from that all right
clean thank you John thanks John
moving on to Alex Alex all right he's
got a girl he built it for his
girlfriend all right off the specs one
drink beer this is a risin 7 1700 X
based system with 16 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance lpx 2400 speed memory that's a
4 by 4 gig kit asus strix be 315
motherboards otech gtx 1070 for graphics
card and EVGA 6 and what bronze power
supply and of course I found a 400-seat
case ok first thing I would upgrade in
this system are a 600 watt bronze
Parsley's nothing wrong with that first
thing I would upgrade upgrade from a
practical standpoint would be your
memory kit get jumpin up it's like a
3,000 at 3200 speak it would get you a
bit more performance out of your CPU we
get overclocked it even overclocking is
you're not I mean you could overclock
the memory yeah but you you're probably
not gonna get too much more out of a
2400 speed kit you never know though so
sure tried overclock your memory for
beyond that aesthetically yes the
ketchup and mustard cables are standing
out that is the trade-off for the very
inexpensive EVGA 500 be 600 B power
supply and why does the case have a
shroud over that area and not the actual
unit is that like a good question
I've never received that what just the
case maybe he removed the maybe there
was a part of the shroud every R over
over that unit and he removed it it
could be it looks like a two-parter it
looks like a two-part shroud but I can't
be sure that's really peculiar though
because those are same ugly cable had
one I'd want to cover that up all right
um that knocked to a fan is great but
yeah this is a great knock to a cooler
stands up aesthetically conflicted
because it's a good cooler so maybe get
some chrome axe action in there yeah
yeah I get the chromatics upgrade for
that beyond that I mean when you upgrade
your power supply you could maybe tidy
up the cable management down here a
little bit and that would be pretty much
the that's what I would recommend and if
you do get a new power supply it maybe
flip it to fans yes and fan down would
be a better choice they'd some dust
filtration there let's dust
thanks Alex thank you Alex and then
finally for our last critique here is
Nick thanks bear Rison v 1600 a HyperX
LED cooler at be 350 msi tomahawk
motherboard EVGA 5 hooded BQ power
supply a GTX 1080 for the win DT 16
gigabyte what is DT DT I think that was
a cheaper yeah the DT I think they were
less expensive than the oh wow I never
even heard that they can't when it I
need a double check yeah well we'll look
into that chat I'm sure you're on it OD
tuned ok yep 16 gigs of DDR 420 400
megabytes
Hertz I think you meant of ram kingston
240 SSD and Rozsival case that has made
it three built so I but I guess he's
been using this case for three different
builds so far I need a new case pronto
I have mismatched memory ah my PC oh wow
there's a lot of cabling going on here
damn so you're right you need a new case
I hate these these five and a quarter
inch the worse those bracket things ear
cancer especially when they have this
like red accent that stands out they're
just plants that good thing those are
really annoying all right you got cable
cables all over the place in here which
is probably again a factor of the case
and probably not being able to route
stuff behind the motherboard tray so a
new case would potentially help you out
there yep again we have an EVGA power
supply
I'd say models ketchup and mustard
cables up here it might be blocked nude
black if I'm gonna be Q this might be a
slightly newer version that has all
black cables still food but yeah it
definitely flipped that that would be a
better situation for you and remove
whatever stickers on the other side of
the power supply if you were gonna flip
it or if you're not gonna flip it just
remove that sticker like that out and
then is it there's a I don't know a CPU
cooler is a good mother grouping of
cables over here underneath the CPU
cooler that are yellow and black and red
mmm and it's probably from this fan it's
probably really crappy fan you know and
this is bunch stuff down there so it
could plug into a head or it there room
but that looks gross yeah I don't like
it get a new fan there's also a new case
a weird cable coming up here which i
think is for the fan for the cooler
master you heat sink fan so going
through the blades the fins on the
heatsink that's that's that best
practice also this little sticker you
can just rip that off that's okay
new case that cable management case tree
drew the kill management's that'll help
a lot yeah I mean cable extensions other
than that you know you got a solid
configuration as far as a six core CPU
and a GTX 1080 and 16 gigs in memory I
mean it's it's a good configuration here
again I would say upgrading the memory
kit to something 3030 to hundreds peter
better yeah what would give me a decent
old
formitz boost - that's always
recommended with rising but yeah get a
new case Nick I appreciate you reusing
the same case three for three different
builds but that means resourceful that
is it is now highly priority list for
being replaced mm-hmm this is an
honorable mention moment
I like this admission this is from Kevin
he has a core i7 8086 K at five point
two gigahertz and of course 32 gigs of
3000 megahertz Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro
an h1 50 I cooler ASUS Maximus 10 code
EVGA 1080 TI for the 1-3 icx samsung 970
1 terabyte they're all in the corsair
570 ex mirror black monitor is an
alienware 34 40 by 1440 older why this
guy has gone all out the specs on this
thing are pretty insane I was also gonna
point out this picture where he has his
color-coordinated pink and blue colors
also has the reflection of his keyboard
which is also color-coordinated yep it's
very hot line esque which is what caught
my eye in particular so the colour
matching is on point those those Corsair
elf ll series fans are doing work son
they look really good in here
like hey you've color synced everything
everything is already color neutral when
the lights are off it's very you know
very black I will say I know this is an
honorable mention but because everything
is all black this could use a little bit
of a wipe down that's all yes yeah you
can see the fingerprints yep I noticed
you wipe down that's all we're asking
yeah treat it like a lady and Haley is
also a prime contender for a lucky cable
extension upgrade kit look at the other
picture he switched oh he did it looks
like he did get an upgrade there I was
gonna point that out in the lip picture
oh you're right yeah he's got some sexy
keels so this must be maybe sort of a
laughter there you go then oh yeah okay
nothing to add no looks good man oh then
Kevin well then I thank you guys for
submitting if you didn't get picked this
week maybe you will sure thank you all
for participating and that's gonna do it
for my half of the show so don't go
anywhere stay on twitch actually do go
somewhere if you're on youtube right now
follow us on Twitter TV / awesome
hardware right now because we're gonna
maybe play some games and as I as I
promised I'm gonna try to unbox that
gigabyte card and see see what it looks
like these stuff that'd be cool
it's a r-tx 2080 or 2080 I forget but on
that note thank you for watching thank
you for being here also we'll do johnson
shoutouts and donations and stuff like
that on the after party and feel free to
do timestamps for my half feel free to
like on it and we love you thank you so
