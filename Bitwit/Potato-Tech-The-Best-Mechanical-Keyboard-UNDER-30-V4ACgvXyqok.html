what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel today we're trying something a
little bit new called potato tech this
may become a little mini web series if
it's well received enough but it should
be exciting what we're basically gonna
do is take a look at some super dirt
cheap products and tell you guys which
ones are spuds and which ones are does
today we're actually gonna be looking at
three of the top rated mechanical
keyboards on Amazon for under 30 bucks
now we're not gonna get very technical
but we are gonna keep four categories in
mind when looking at these keyboards
first one is gonna be aesthetics quality
performance and lastly features Kyle and
I we're actually not gonna be in the
same room when we're looking at these
keyboards just to ensure that we don't
influence each other's opinions at the
very end of all this Heather and I are
gonna have some scoring cards so we're
gonna play scoring cards on each of the
keyboards based on how we feel about
them from best to worst but we're gonna
play them facedown and secretly and then
reveal our results at the very end to
see if our opinions match up which might
because we're married so you know or
they might not because we're married
so it'll be very interesting to say the
least very excited to get this underway
so are you ready I'm ready let's bring
out in the first keyboard
this is the Aki keyboard comes with a
key cap remover this is useful
looks pretty boring very plain very
minimal but that's my style most of the
time this kind of looks like a like a
USB stick to me it's a little parlor no
logos that I like how small the body is
you know it's mechanical switches so it
could be a gaming keyboard but it could
also blend in at like a doctor's office
the keys are a little bit weird I don't
think I like the font that they use for
this keyboard it's really weird
the font on the keyboard is somewhat gay
Marie it's a little bit gay Marie but
it's not too over-the-top quality is
also not bad either
I mean it's plastic but very little flex
quality features actually what are the
features of this keyboard looks like
we've got windows lock key some
multimedia function keys some hotkeys
for email web browser volume up and down
no LEDs on this guy which I personally
do not mind at all there's definitely
not RGB so that's a minus 1 right there
5 foot cable pop out feet with rubber
you always get pop out feet you don't
always get rubber on the feet though
Cherry MX a stem right there so you
could replace these key caps with some
cherry MX key caps if you wanted to oh
look what they have right here though a
key cap remover
and ours pretty good
I believe this keyboard is also spill
resistant if I remember correctly from
the product page so that's actually nice
I think this keyboard also has n key
rollover just see how this one it's
pretty boring it's like it's just
playing and just looks like a very
generic keyboard to be honest if I
remember correctly there's a 24 month
warranty on this keyboard which is twice
as long as the other two
that definitely instill some confidence
in in this product compared to the other
two I will say that you know what this
actually feels pretty good I like how
it's very like short quick travel not
long and obnoxious sound like doing
anything for me it's not bad not good
this is uh you know for under 30 bucks I
mean bad it's alright
hc' man or Hickman I'll just call it
Hickman because that sounds easier to
say comes with a key cap remover as well
we've got a two-tone thing going on here
silver body looks like aluminum alloy
maybe the black on the silver I'm just
not a fan it looks nice
it looks nicer in person than it does in
photos I will say that that XY is zero
points is this the same font it looks
like the exact same font like the key
cap font is exactly the same as the
Yaqui again what is with these fonts
well arrow keys on this side are kind of
weird looking a little bit more flex
than the Aki
definitely a bit more flex also a bit
lighter too I should mention from the
little research I did do that all these
keyboards are not only 10 keyless but
they also all feature blue switches
however they are not cherry MX they're
all their own in-house name-brand or
whatever oh oh
the feet are plastic so they kind of I
feel like no matter what service
they're going to it's gonna be on it's
gonna kinda just like slide around type
no rubber that's too bad volume up and
down mute windows lock key as well your
web browser email calculator maybe we
get a braided cable weird how you can
see like the screws from this side of
the keyboard like you can actually see a
tiny screw there then I also don't like
how they have like a little screw
showing on the front like I feel like
keyboards look very seamless and it's
kind of like an or some ice poor site
ice or kind of an eyesore why don't we
go ahead all right
RGB LEDs confirmed RGB I'll be honest
it's not the highest quality LED
treatment I've seen this you know what
you you just gain some points here we
okay so this this keyboards definitely a
lot more blingy it's got it's got the
bling factor that the other two do not
Cherry MX stems so again you could put
key caps on this guy
interesting they almost have like a
loose feel like they feel like there's
almost not quite enough actuation force
from my liking I like a little bit of
resistance you know I'm saying I'm not
thirty they just kind of go down too
easy like a cheap hooker I actually do
like the typing the performance on this
keyboard you know it's also interesting
is that these key caps some of you can
tell but they're a little loose they
kind of pivot a little bit right makes
my fingers feel insecure I don't know if
that makes sense but and I feel like the
cheaper plastic that's used here makes
them a bit more slippery yeah I can't
quite put my finger on it
Tomoko he kept remover well if it wasn't
for a little logo right here I would
think that the Aki was just a place
right in front of me this looks very
similar to the Aki like strikingly
similar they must be using the same om
we still have pop-out feet you get a non
braided cable just like the Aki
so I definitely like the font much more
than I do on the other ones it's much
easier to read and they don't have like
weird symbols the font is is just not
gamer e at all it's just like it's like
Calibri or Arial or something which hell
yeah I'm a huge fan of that this one it
definitely looks the best out of all
three of them for sure not a huge fan of
the branding here just a little T symbol
whatever logo looks a little tacky to me
I'd rather just say you know nothing at
all the Tomoko this one that I'm holding
right now is much heavier another two so
right there he's got some weight to it
quality wise like I can already tell
that I think this one is gonna be the
best hardly any flex here definitely
much higher quality here the key caps
once again MX stems
I believe this keyboard is fill proof as
well and key roll over we got windows
block key volume up and down mutes and
multimedia keys yeah these feel good
it's so great it's a little bit more
like sticky like it doesn't there's some
resistance that's where the comedy is
there's more like resistance could be a
little bit more resistant it's personal
thing I feel like the resistance is
about the same for the Aki and the
Tomoko but actually I feel like the Aki
has a little bit more resistance and the
Tomoko so I think the biggest difference
between these two keyboards are the
switches themselves these switches don't
feel quite as resistant as these ones
these have a they feel like they have a
higher actuation force you know and
there's this one that's I actually do
like the typing on this keyboard more
than I like these ones I don't know this
this is going to be really tough man
it's tough it's really close but I think
I'm ready I think I know who the real
winner is here all right here we are
judgment time so the way this is gonna
work is that wifey sauce and I have
three ranking cards or three scoring
cards each one representing our favorite
keyboard one representing our second
favorite keyboard and the third card
representing the keyboard we liked least
we're gonna be playing these cards on
each of these keyboards facedown very
secretively we're gonna close our eyes
and then chris is gonna flip them over
we're gonna do a big reveal and talk
about our results or our decision sound
good all right so whenever you're ready
go ahead and place your cards on the
appropriate keyboards so pink is
obviously white Vsauce and I am blue so
eyes closed I suppose Chris do your work
oh don't swap the cards I can feel you I
can feel you swapping them oh very
opposite yeah nearly like opposite holy
moley so you thought this one was the
worst the akhi yeah I hated this one the
most why I thought it was so similar to
this one the resistance this one had a
little bit more resistance yes which is
why I like that one better I don't like
it I don't like the resistance well I
like them to be easier to touch yeah so
for me that's why this is not a
scientific video it's entirely
subjective that makes sense
so I hated this one the most I would
never use this keyboard okay that being
said I wasn't sure which one I was gonna
pick first between the tomoko and HT man
because I liked that these Keys had the
least resistance out of all three
keyboards they did have the least
resistance but almost to a fault in my
opinion because they were so loose like
I feel like they could have used
more resistance and I felt myself like
Miss typing a lot more on these keys
because I tend to be more heavy-handed
when I type so that's why and the key
caps were just too loose for my liking
it just felt like this this definitely
felt the cheapest out of the three in
terms of weight why I gave it second
place and like ascetics like this by far
is like the ugliest keyboard I agree out
of all three but you still chose this
one over this one because of the way the
keys felt yeah honestly it's just if if
this keyboard had these switches then I
would have definitely given it first
place so it really it was this which is
that it was a switches it boils down to
the switches for me like that's the main
thing I'm going to be doing on a
keyboard and these felt the most
comfortable for my typing style so I
guess everyone's everyone's different
types well cool I'm glad that we I just
sort of agree on something yeah
that's that's the other reason why I
gave it the spud dud they're encouraging
the use of a poor poorly made web
browser well that was a lot of fun yes I
guess this is all to say if you're gonna
pick up one of these keyboards in the
near future you should definitely go
with the Aki
oh no I hate that way she doesn't even
know if she does even know what 20 she
voted for clearly the Aki is the best
one no forget that
Tomoko a tomato people sound like you're
some likes of you are any two key kept
grenade all right on that note guys
thank you very much for tuning in
let us know what you thought of potato
package you like to see us bring this
back okay we're gonna have to pick the
you're gonna have to pick these up at
some point all right very good let's end
the damn video have a good one guys

will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
