what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel today we're trying something a
little bit new called potato tech this
may become a little mini web series if
it's well received enough but it should
be exciting what we're basically gonna
do is take a look at some super dirt
cheap products and tell you guys which
ones are spuds and which ones are duds
today we're actually gonna be looking at
three of the top rated mechanical
keyboards on Amazon for under 30 bucks
now we're not gonna get very technical
but we are gonna keep four categories in
mind when looking at these keyboards
first one is gonna be aesthetics quality
performance and lastly features Kyle and
I we're actually not gonna be in the
same room when we're looking at these
keyboards just to ensure that we don't
influence each other's opinions at the
very end of all this Heather and I are
gonna have some scoring cards so we're
gonna play scoring cards on each of the
keyboards based on how we feel about
them from best to worst but we're gonna
play them facedown and secretly and then
reveal our results at the very end to
see if our opinions match up which might
be cuz we're married so you know or they
might not because we're married so it'll
be very interesting to say the least
very excited to get this underway so are
you ready I'm ready let's bring out in
the first keyboard
Wow this is the Aki keyboard comes with
a key cap remover this is useful
looks pretty boring very plain very
minimal but that's my style most of the
time this kind of looks like a like a
USB stick to me it's a little powering a
logo that I like how small the body is
you know it's mechanical switches so it
could be a gaming keyboard but it could
also blend in at like a doctor's office
the keys are a little bit weird I don't
think I like the font that they use for
this keyboard it's really weird
the font on the keyboard is somewhat
gamer II it's a little bit gamer II but
it's not too over-the-top quality is
also not bad either
I mean it's plastic but very little flex
quality what features actually what are
the features of this keyboard looks like
we've got windows lock key some
multimedia function keys some hotkeys
for email web browser volume up and down
no LEDs on this guy which I personally
do not mind at all there's definitely
not RGB so that's a minus 1 right there
5 foot cable pop out feet with rubber
you always get pop out feet you don't
always get rubber on the feet though
Cherry MX a stem right there so you
could replace these key caps with some
cherry MX key caps if you wanted to oh
look what they have right here though a
key cap remover
and ours pretty good
I believe this keyboard is also spill
resistant if I remember correctly from
the product page so that's actually nice
I think this keyboard also has n key
rollover much to say about this one it's
pretty boring it like it's just playing
and just looks like a very generic
keyboard to be honest if I remember
correctly there's a 24 month warranty on
this keyboard which is twice as long as
the other two that definitely instilled
some confidence in in this product
compared to the other two I will say
that you know what this actually feels
pretty good I like how it's very like
short quick travel not long and
obnoxious sound like doing anything for
me it's not bad it's not good this is uh
you know for under 30 bucks I mean bad
alright hc' man or Hickman I'll just
call it Hickman cuz that sounds easier
to say comes with a key cap remover as
well we've got a two-tone thing going on
here silver body looks like aluminum
alloy maybe the black on the silver I'm
just not a fan it looks nice it looks
nicer in person than it does in photos I
will say that that XY is zero points is
this the same font it looks like the
exact same font like the keycap font is
exactly the same as the Yaqui again what
is with these fonts well arrow keys on
this side are kind of weird-looking a
little bit more flex than the Aki
definitely a bit more flex also a bit
lighter too she mentioned from the
little research I did do that all these
keyboards are not only 10 keyless but
they also all feature blue switches
however they are not cherry MX they're
all their own in-house name-brand or
whatever
oh the feet are plastic so they kind of
I feel like no matter what service
they're going to it's gonna be on it's
gonna just like slide around type no
rubber that's too bad volume up and down
mute windows lock key as well your web
browser email calculator do we get a
braided cable weird how you can see like
the screws from this side of the
keyboard like you can actually see a
tiny screw there then I also don't like
how they have like a little screw
showing on the front like I feel like
keyboards look very seamless and it's
kind of like an ice poor site eyesore
kind of an eyesore alright RGB LEDs
confirmed RGB I'll be honest it's not
the highest quality LED treatment I've
seen this you know what you you just
gain some points here we okay so this
this keyboards definitely a lot more
blingy it's got it's got the bling
factor that the other two do not Cherry
MX stems so again you could put key caps
on this guy interesting they almost have
like a loose feel like they feel like
there's almost not quite enough
actuation force from my liking I like a
little bit of resistance you know I'm
saying I'm thirsty I'm not 30 they just
kind of go down too easy like a cheap
hooker I actually do like the typing the
performance on this keyboard you know
what's also interesting is that these
key caps
some of you can tell but they're a
little loose they kind of pivot a little
bit right makes my fingers feel insecure
I don't know if that makes sense but and
I feel like the cheaper plastic that's
used here makes them a bit more slippery
yeah I can't quite put my finger on it
Tomoko he kept remover well if it wasn't
for the little logo right here I would
think that the Aki was just a place
right in front of me this looks very
similar to the Aki like strikingly
similar they must be using the same om
we still have pop-out feet did you get a
non braided cable just like the Aki so I
definitely like the font much more than
I do on the other ones it's much easier
to read and they don't have like weird
symbols the font is is just not gamer e
at all it's just like it's like Calibri
or aerial or something which hell yeah
I'm a huge fan of that this one it
definitely looks the best out of all
three of them for sure
not a huge fan of the branding here just
a little T symbol whatever logo looks a
little tacky to me I'd rather just say
you know nothing at all the Tomoko this
one that I'm holding right now is much
heavier another two so right there she's
got some weight to it quality wise like
I can already tell I think this one is
gonna be the best hardly any flex here
definitely much higher quality here the
key caps once again MX stems
I believe this keyboard is fill proof as
well and key roll over we got windows
block key volume up and down mutes and
multimedia keys yeah
these feel good feel great like it's a
little bit more like sticky like it
doesn't there's some resistance that's
where the how to use there's more like
resistance could be a little bit more
resistance personal thing I feel like
the resistance is about the same for the
Aki Anna Tomoko but actually I feel like
the Aki has a little bit more resistance
and the Tomoko so I think the biggest
difference between these two keyboards
are the switches themselves these
switches don't feel quite as resistant
as these ones these have a they feel
like they have a higher actuation force
you know and there's this one that's I
actually do like the typing on this
keyboard more than I like these ones I
don't know this
this is going to be really tough man
it's tough it's really close but I think
I'm ready I think I know who the real
winner is here all right here we are
judgment time so the way this is gonna
work is that wifey sauce and I have
three ranking cards or three scoring
cards each one representing our favorite
keyboard one representing our second
favorite keyboard and the third card
representing the keyboard we like least
we're gonna be playing these cards on
each of these keyboards facedown very
secretively we're gonna close our eyes
and then chris is gonna flip them over
we're gonna do a big reveal and talk
about our results or our decision sound
good sounds groovy all right
so whenever you're ready go ahead and
place your cards on the appropriate
keyboards so pink is obviously wifey
sauce and I am blue so nice clothes I
suppose Chris
do your work oh don't swap the cards you
can feel you can feel you swapping them
very opposite yeah surely like opposite
holy moley
so you thought this one was the worst
the akhi yeah I hated this one the most
why I thought it was so similar to this
one the resistance this one had a little
bit more resistance yes which is why I
like that one but I don't like it I
don't like the resistance where I like
them to be easier to touch yeah so for
me that's why this is not a scientific
video it's entirely subjective that
makes sense so I hated this one the most
I would never use this keyboard okay
that being said I wasn't sure which one
I was gonna pick first between the
tomoko and HT man because I liked that
these keys had the least resistance out
of all three keyboard they did have the
least resistance but almost to a fault
in my opinion because they were so loose
like I feel like they could have used
more resistance and I felt myself like
Miss typing a lot more on these keys
because I tend to be more heavy-handed
when I type so that's why and the key
caps were just too loose for my liking
it just felt like this this definitely
felt the cheapest out of the three in
terms of weight why I gave it second
place and like I said acts like this by
far is like that ugliest keyboard I
agree I have all three but you still
chose this one over this one because of
the way the keys felt honestly if if
this keyboard had these switches then I
would have definitely given it first
place so really it was this which is
that it was a switches it boils down to
the switches for me like that's the main
thing I'm gonna be doing on a keyboard
and these felt the most comfortable for
my typing style so I guess everyone's
everyone's different yes
types well cool I'm glad that we I just
sort of agree on something yeah that's
that's not the reason why I gave it the
spud dud they're encouraging the use of
a poor poorly made web browser well that
was a lot of fun yes I guess this is all
to say if you're gonna pick up one of
these keyboards in the near future you
should definitely go with the octane oh
she does even know you she does even
know what 20 she voted for clearly the
Aki is the best one no forget that
Tomoko tomato keyboard sound like you're
some like text review are only two
verses key kept grenades all right on
that note guys thank you very much for
tuning in
let us know what you thought of potato
package you'd like to see you bring this
back okay we're gonna have to pick these
you're gonna have to pick these up at
some point all right very good
let's end the damn video have a good one
guys subscribe to the channel and all
that we will see you all in the next
