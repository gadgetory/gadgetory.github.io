to you by be quiet cable mod verda gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info all right
we're at fantex check it out guys
remember this this was project two one
seven or two seventeen back in the day
at CES in January but they've since
renamed it the marketing is got a little
bit smarter I think it's now called the
shift and the shift X what you're
looking at right now is the shift X this
is the taller one that's a bit more
conducive for custom water cooling and
things like that and then we've also got
the shift which is the non X version
it's a little bit shorter but still
maintains more or less the same
footprint this is really just a very
very flexible design you can mount it
either vertically as you see here or
horizontally depending just on sort of
the situation that you're trying to go
for this looks like it could easily be
on like a really nice desk area if
you're just trying to use it for a
regular desktop or if you want to use it
Evan htpc it does look like it would go
really well in the living room also so
there's definitely a lot of flexibility
here but let's go ahead and take a
little quick 360 here you can see we've
got tempered glass side panels on both
the left and right sides this is kind of
a brushed aluminum as a saloon I believe
yes aluminum here then we've also got an
aluminum cover on the X model its
plastic on the non X model that still
seems very rugged and durable and if you
look at the left side here first off
let's just go ahead and well you know it
first off let's take off these side
panels so we can get a look at this
let's get this thing undressed so this
is the left side here and we've got a
sort of a two chamber design on the top
you've got your motherboard and your CPU
they've already detected that with
custom water cooling just give you an
example of just how insane you can make
the system here even though this fairly
small form-factor you also have this
sort of middle area that sort of divides
the two compartments for some cable
management and it does have this
magnetic door that pulls down for easy
access which I really kind of like that
design and if you look at the bottom
here you can see that there's oh
actually forgot about the 140 millimeter
fan right here so that's actually set to
exhaust and the fact that you actually
have one of the side panels here if you
know if you notice that that section in
the middle that also helps
compartmentalize this chassis so that
you actually can have one fan exhausting
air at the top and maybe you have a
couple fans in taking at the bottom and
so those two airflow paths don't
intersect or interfere with each other
so right here we've got two 140 s you
can do two 120 s as well not to mention
radiator support up to 280 millimetres
for your AIO or custom liquid-cooled
radiator you can see they've already
mounted of course a nice little
reservoir in here at the bottom of the
case here we've got a 140 millimeter fan
set to intake it pulls air from the
bottom and brings it up through the
through the rest of the case at least
where it meets the the middle section
separator here and you actually have a
couple options for the power supply
right now they have an SFX unit that's
mounted in here with a nice little
shroud actually so it kind of covers
some of the cable entry however you can
opt for a full sized ATX unit however
you will also have to drop that shroud
if you offer that but it is nice to have
the optional flexibility either way if
you take a look at this side you've got
some front IO or should I say rear i/o
this is actually the back of the case
we're looking at you get 2 USB 3 I kind
of just like how it's at the back so
it's a bit more discreet if you want
just a more clean minimalistic design at
the back here you can see that there's
the there's the power supply fan
they've set properly and there's just a
ton of cable management at the very back
of the chassis you you also get 2 SSD
mounts at the back here there's two more
on the inside so that gives you four two
and a half inch drive support as well as
two three and a half inch drives and
then if you look over look I just like
how there's like a lot of like velcro
straps tie-down points very thoughtful
every single inch of this chassis seems
to be utilized for a purpose and if you
go onto this side you see this is where
the graphics card is mounted sort of on
a side sort of vertical orientation and
you can actually change the left or
right orientation based on which way you
want the card to face so you can see
here we've got a really nice shot of
their water block here but you could
flip it completely 90 degrees or I guess
180 degrees sorry if you wanted to let's
say this was an air-cooled card you
could actually open up the card for a
little bit more airflow by facing the
fans away from the tempered glass or of
course you could opt for a more
aesthetic look if you wanted to show off
the nice shroud there at the top of the
case now we've got this nice little door
here again this is made out of aluminum
very sturdy construction kind of like
how it's on a sort of a spring
suspension here it's very sturdy and
you've also got a look at the rear i/o
for your motherboard I guess you could
call this a top i/o because it is
sticking out the top you get out you
actually write route your wires through
the the hole in the back very seamlessly
you actually wouldn't see where they're
exiting out from the from the front so
that's a really clean system there or
you can actually route the cables all
the way down behind this back panel at
the bottom if you want it to be even
more discreet for a nice clean tidy
so I really can't wait to get my hands
on one of these things of course if
fantex is willing to part with a sample
in the near future because it does
definitely seem like there's a lot you
can do in very little space here and in
case you guys were wondering or wanting
to get your hands on one of one of these
yourselves you can opt for the X version
which is 159 us MSRP or the non X shift
which is going to go for about 109 USD
MSRP so look forward to these very soon
in the near future so I honestly can't
remember if I filled you guys in or even
hinted at this but I am planning a
pretty epic water cooling system in the
very near future in collaboration with
fantex using one of their super high-end
cases I'm sure you guys can guess which
one I'm talking about but it's going to
feature a lot of their water cooling
hardware as well including some of these
fittings these are some 16 millimeter
these are really built for ptg tubing so
it is going to be a hard line system
which I'm super excited to start working
on as well as some of these very
beautiful water blocks and these are
pretty much no matter even if you're you
know you depending on if you're a
gigabyte fan MSI Asus you pretty much
have your pick of the litter as in terms
of compatibility they even have
different stylized designs you can see
that one of them is like completely
chromed the other one has this really
nice sort of matte black finish which I
really like the main point is that
they're ready for purchase and they
absolutely look fantastic so look
forward to that as well so check this
out guys this is also a new sort of
innovation from fantex these are their
halos I guess they're calling them RGB
fan frames and it's a pretty good name
for them essentially this is sort of
what the construction looks like after
it's over before it's really finished
this is the aluminum design and you can
see that basically all these fans are
illuminated not the fans themselves but
actually the LED strip that goes within
this sort of fan frame it's a really
cool design here what problem this
solves is when you have a super high-end
fan that delivers really good airflow or
good static pressure whatever but might
not have the RGB implementation that
you're looking for and oftentimes RGB
fans while they look really pretty don't
always perform that well this is kind of
like the the antlion mod Mike approach
where you can use your own set of
headphones but also add a really
high-end microphone without having to
sacrifice your current cans so this is
sort of the same the same model that
we're looking at more or less where you
can actually use pretty much any fan you
want whether it's 120 or 140 millimeters
and still have the RGB functionality and
it looks absolutely fantastic whether
it's on black blade
or white blades I think the white blades
look a little bit more eye-catching the
the color definitely reflects a little
bit nicer but it looks beautiful on
either-or as far as controlling goes the
LEDs themselves can be controlled either
through an RGB controlled case from
fantex of course or you can actually
wire them directly to a supported
motherboard and take advantage and
control all the custom features via
software so you kind of have your option
in that regard as far as pricing goes
the both plastic models all the plastic
models are the same price whether you're
going 120 or 140 that's going to be nine
ninety nine or nine ten bucks more or
less we got seventeen and nineteen
dollars respectively for your 120 and
140 millimeter variants now for those of
you who are thinking about pulling the
trigger on the NP Pro M or maybe are
just a huge fan already of this case now
there's a special edition that's going
to make the old one seem just a little
bit less special and the reason for that
is well there's a couple of reasons
first of all you get a really nice
tempered glass side panel which just
looks fabulous I think I'm a personal
believer in this even though some people
call it a fad
once you have tempered glass on your
case you don't ever want to go back to
acrylic just because first of all it
looks amazing and it doesn't scratch
nearly as easily so that's actually a
nice bit of functionality built in you
also get some nice RGB element upgrades
here including a pair of 140 millimeter
halos fans that we just talked about so
you get to 140 s I believe one of the
front one of the back perhaps of course
you can arrange them any way you like
and you also get integrated RGB
functionality built into the case itself
so you can change the colors on that or
you can actually just plug the fans
again into the motherboard itself and
control it via the software for however
you choose to customise your LEDs check
us out guys this is the ar160 this is
part of their Glacier series here at
fantex and just look out small I'll use
my hand for scale this is a really small
little compact reservoir here but it's
actually pretty flexible as well you can
actually mount it to either 120 or 140
millimeter fan it does come with the
mounting bracket and that mounting
bracket also includes an RGB strip that
sort of makes direct contact in a way
with the unit and just kind of provides
a really nice electric glow to the whole
system so are the whole unit I should
say so that's kind of a prime example of
what it looks like I'll fire it up
it looks really cool and yeah
RGB you can pretty much tailor to
whatever your heart's content depending
on the color scheme you're trying to
achieve there's a lot of Inlet and
outlet options here as well so you can
see right here it's mounted in a
vertical vertical position but if you
wanted to let's say you wanted to mount
it to the top of your case or something
like that you could mount it
horizontally as well and I also do like
the fact that since it is so so slim you
kind of just see it's like a really thin
profile there you can mount it to the
more back side of your case or you can
bring it up to the front as well now if
you take a look at the back here you'll
see that there's an aluminum and on the
underbelly of that on the internals
there's actually a copper base plate so
it does provide a bit more thermal
dissipation and heat conductivity for
the liquid inside which should
theoretically help with thermals so
that's really nice to see additionally
you can see that there's sort of a look
looks like a little area for a pump here
and while the pump is not included you
could if you wanted to add in your own
DDC pump and actually make this sort of
a combo rasz pump unit which would save
even more space in say a small
form-factor system or just in any case
in general $89 u.s. MSRP available q3
watch out for this guy
coming soon alright guys check this case
out this is the Eclipse p300 at a measly
$59 us which is absolutely insane you
can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be
doing a budget build in this case as
soon as it comes to market this thing's
absolutely incredible it sort of builds
on the the same sort of model as the P
400 which is which is a very well
received and very popular budget case
this is even cheaper than that and
offers still a lot of functionality for
what you're paying so first off tempered
glass side panel fan Tex is really privy
to these and it's just I really like the
direction that this is going being able
to get tempered glass just for this
price point is absolutely incredible and
you can see that it's a sort of a
smaller window here it does have like
the blacked-out perimeter that you can
see there but you can see that it only
it ends right here where the power
supply shroud is first off you get a
power supply shroud it's nice to have a
basement again for this cheap of a case
you can see it just tidies up the cable
management overall there's a bit of an
LED accent that's going to be right
along here just a nice little tasteful
strip as well as the power button up top
along with some front panel IO audio and
headphone jacks USB 3 and I believe this
is the RGB controller so you can
actually control the RGB of Cour
that's pretty redundant 140 millimeter
fan mount right here with a fan filter
or a dust filter I should say and it
looks like from the inside here you also
get up to 280 don't quote me on this
because this is still sort of a
prototype but there's definitely going
to be some sort of a robust radiator
solution at the front of the case here
it looks like there's two hundred and
eighty millimeter mounting points here
it might be 240 I'm going to say 280
because that number is higher and I like
it look at that big nice big CPU cooler
cutouts that's also very nice to see and
since this is the budget case you don't
get like rubber grommets or things like
that but it is also very minimalistic
it's got a nice little cover here on the
front where the cables can just route
behind and I think this is a really nice
solution that I would prefer over just
massive cutouts that are very very
visible so overall very clean setup here
flip it around to the back here you can
see we've got a couple SSD mounts two
and a half inch drive mounts that's very
nice to see plenty of space for cable
management also thoughtful tie-down
points along the back of the motherboard
tray and here at the front we have here
your hard drive cage it looks like you
can fit two three and a half inch drives
here and it does look like there's also
some space here for cable management you
can route your SATA cables through that
front grommet right there you can route
your cables through that front cut out
right there that's not a grommet I
mentioned that there are a lot of design
features that sort of lend itself to the
p400 one including this just sort of how
the front ventilation looks first of all
it sort of has that similar aesthetic
it's not quite the same but very similar
and the ventilation is going to be
existing at the top and the bottom of
the case looks very very ample like the
actual spacing between the vents it's
pretty generous so it doesn't look like
it's going to be starved for airflow by
any means because it looks like you're
not going to have a super wide open
ventilation all across the front of the
case you can expect this case coming out
very soon in q3 of 2017 all right gel
does can conclude it for my coverage
here at the spandex booth at Computex
2017 thank you so much again to my
sponsors for making this trip possible
EVGA be quiet verdict year and cable odd
go ahead and check out their stuff in
the description below otherwise I'll see
you guys in the next video
very soon have a good one perks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
