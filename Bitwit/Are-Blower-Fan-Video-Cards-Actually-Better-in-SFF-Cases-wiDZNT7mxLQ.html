or so we've seen this explosion of
premium mini ITX chassis x' targeted at
better airflow liquid cooling support
and hardware compatibility this new
breed of small form-factor cases has
more or less been well received by the
community allowing for an assortment of
powerful configurations never before
possible in such a tiny footprint one
caveat however is that many of these
chassis x' are designed with the close
proximity between the power supply and
graphics card which is often said to
pose a thermal concern particularly for
cards whose fans are either partially or
entirely blocked by the PSU thereby
restricting the amount of air intake
required to keep the GPU cool a popular
school of thought to combat this
potential issue is to use a video card
with a single blower style fan that's
positioned at the far end of the cooler
and the Sun Eclipse to buy the power
supply
additionally blower style cards are
typically fitted with enclosed shrouds
that exhaust hot air exclusively out the
back of the case which is said to
further improve thermals of other
components in the system especially
those of the small form factor variety
so today I am putting these various
claims to the test to find out the
optimal GPU configuration for the
specific type of mini ITX case the first
question in our investigation is whether
a standard non blower graphics card in
an ATX case performs less adequately
when put inside a small case where it's
being encroached upon by the power
supply to test this as fairly as
possible I needed to build two systems
using all the same parts with the
exception of the motherboard and of
course the chassis for our mid tower I
decided on the define s from fractal
design so it seemed appropriate to use
their define nano s for our mini ITX
built with its identical interior lamped
the top ma Juventus were removed from
both cases for more ventilation and each
system was equipped with a pair of
fractals own GP series fans connected to
the motherboard all 140 millimeter
models except for the 120 exhaust in the
define nano s due to mounting
limitations I'd also like to note here
that the front intake fan in the Nano s
was positioned to favor the GPU for all
the tests we ran our processor is the
core i5 6600 K that I've overclocked to
4.5 gigahertz and that's what the help
of B quiets dark rock 3 cooler like our
cases I tried to find similar
motherboards despite them having
different form factors so here we have
the EVGA z170 for the win and it
tiny counterpart to the z170 stinger the
boards were paired with eight gigs of
corsair lpx ddr4 3200 and powered by a
fractal design Integra 750 watt PSU
Windows 10 in all applications were run
from this one terabyte crutial MX 200
SSD and lastly for graphics we have the
EVGA gtx 1070 for the win Edition to
represent our non blower subject and a
gtx 1070 founder's addition for our
blower card to better spot any thermal
constraints both GPUs were overclocked
to the same core clock frequency of
around 2 gigahertz that we'll see that
number vary a bit with different thermal
conditions I should also mention that I
kept a close eye on ambient temp
stirring today's tests to ensure that my
room never ventured outside the range of
25 to 26 degrees Celsius to put a
working load on the systems I fired up
Unigine Heaven 4.0 for 20 to 30 minutes
at a time before taking a screenshot of
all the temps clock speeds and other
relevant data that we'll be using for
comparison with that said let's circle
back to answering our first question
here to see if our non blower card
favors one case or the other
taking a look first at our mid tower
results in the define sr4 the wind card
was set to an auto fan curve in MSI
Afterburner
averaging a core clock speed of 2025
megahertz and maxing out at 80 degrees
Celsius hopefully we don't see much
hotter temps when switching cases as
this is already pretty toasty on the
bright side the GPU clock speed
maintained it's 2025 megahertz frequency
despite the chip being relatively warm
for the CPU the cores on our 6600 K
reach to max temp of 64 degrees Celsius
which seems about par for the course
given this type of cooler in overclock
now let's see how our mini ITX system
fared with the same OC and fan settings
CPU temps are pretty much the same maybe
a degree warmer at most but overall it
seems moving to the smaller case hasn't
had much effect on our coolers ability
to tame the CPU hopefully the same goes
for our video koh god well this is
interesting the GPU rose a whopping 5
degrees taking it to a fiery 85 degrees
Celsius it also appears that this extra
heat prompted GPU boost to enforce some
thermal regulation which brought down
our core clock speed by about 25
megahertz now the slightly lower
frequency I can live with but no GPU
should be running at these temperatures
for an extended period of time from this
initial test it can conclude that a PSU
restrictive chassis is likely to
introduce more heat to an
blower style videocard would things
improve if using a card with a blower
fan like our gtx 1070 founders edition
here maybe but first I wanted to see how
much I'd have to crank the fans on our
for the win edition to get us under the
80 degrees Celsius mark with the current
OSI settings it turns out the answer was
95 percent fan speed only then did our
GPU stay below 80 degrees Celsius under
load and my guess is that the fans are
needing to work twice as hard because
one of them is being starved for airflow
by the power supply a small benefit here
is that the GPU boost actually bumped up
the core clock to 2012 megahertz due to
the lower temperatures sure we've
escaped the thermal danger zone and even
recovered some of our performance but at
what cost to our fragile ears here's a
back-to-back sound test with the GPU
fans at Auto versus 95% sound speed
so we have quite a predicament on our
hands
in one scenario we're suffering
extremely hot GPU temperatures and in
another we have an obnoxious amount of
fan noise plus having one of the GPU
fans so close to the power supply
doesn't do much to help our acoustics
and sure this is why small form-factor
cases like the define an OS are geared
towards liquid cooling over air but
still there's bound to be some users who
have either missed the memo or built a
system similar to this one and find
themselves in the same conundrum if that
sounds like you and swapping parts out
of your existing rig isn't an option
there's probably a few things you can do
to remedy the issue such as installing
more case fans the Nano s has some of
the best fan mounting options for a
chassis and size tidying up the outgoing
cables from your power supply to open up
more airflow or reducing or removing
your GPU overclocked entirely to keep it
from overheating now this might cost you
some slight in-game performance but it's
likely not worth causing any damage to
your components I really wish I had time
to test out the Nano s loaded up with
case fans and such but that's a focus
for another video our next move here is
to see if the gtx 1070 founder's edition
and its blower fan will be more
effective in the mini ITX chassis than
our for the win
so under load we saw the GPU clock
average out at the same two gigahertz
mark with a max temp of 84 degrees
Celsius interestingly we found virtually
no difference in performance or thermals
between the two graphics cards in this
setup there was one change though if we
look over at our CPU temps we can see
that the 6600 K actually dropped a whole
5 degrees Celsius on its hottest core
could this be a fluke or was the
enclosed shroud actually helping to move
heat away from our CPU to verify I ran
the load test once again and what do you
know we came up with the same results
our CPU temps seem to have improved
significantly just by switching to the
founder's edition but the card itself is
still running pretty damn hot so just as
we did with the EVGA card I tried to get
the temps of our reference 1070 to stay
below 80 degrees Celsius to our delight
we easily reached our temperature target
with only 60% fan speed that seems a lot
slower than the 95% that are for the
wind card needed to operate it but bear
in mind that the fans we're comparing
here are completely different in size
and engineering and if we look at gpu-z
both cards were actually spinning at
around the same rpm
so which one do you think was quieter
interesting it turns out the founders
Edition ran much quieter under load with
its blower fan unimpeded the cooler was
able to operate as intended without
requiring an absurd bump in fan speed
keeping noise levels down the
positioning also helped to eliminate any
turbulence noise from the fan being
pressed up against the power supply the
only benefit that our EVGA card saw in
this test was a small 12 megahertz boost
in core clock speed but I think most of
us would prefer the dramatically reduced
noise levels any day of the week so to
sum things up with today's results to
say that blower cards run inherently
cooler than non blower cards in this
type of small form-factor case doesn't
always tell the full story as per our
testing installing both cards and
hitting the same clock speed resulted in
identical temperatures where the blower
card truly shines is its ability to
operate at 100% efficiency which allows
it to maintain a quieter acoustic
profile than a custom multi fan card
another bonus here is that an enclosed
graphics card can make a significant
dent in reducing temperatures of other
components in a meeting ITX chassis both
of these findings tend to make blower
cards quite appealing to those building
in a case like the defined nano s
especially since a lot of added board
partners are manufacturing these types
of coolers at a reduced cost from their
reference design counterparts of course
you can also beat the heat by using a
card with an AO liquid cooler or go big
with your own custom water cooling loop
assuming you have the funds on a final
note I'd like to say that I'm not trying
to throw shade to this new wave of mini
cases
nor am I saying that the 1074 the wind
is an awful card or anything like that
I'm simply sharing my data so that the
DIY community can make informed buying
decisions and vendors can continue
working to overcome these kinds of
challenges in order to provide the best
