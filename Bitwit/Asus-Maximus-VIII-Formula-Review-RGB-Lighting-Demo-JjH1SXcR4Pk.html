channel today I'm checking out one of
the most highly anticipated motherboards
to support six gen skylake processors on
the z170 chipset this is the ASUS
Maximus 8 formula and it's the latest
addition to the brands rog lineup it's
also the latest addition to my pile of
stuff that doesn't suck coming in at a
hefty $400 MSRP now might be a good time
to have a sit-down with mom and dad
about your next allowance race the first
of many robust features this board
brings to the table is its stealthy rog
armor which includes a plastic shield on
the front to minimize dust buildup and a
metal backplate for reducing potential
board flexing and trace damage thermal
pads beneath the backplate also aid in
cooling the vrm as we've seen on other
asus boards like the saber-tooth x99 the
overall aesthetic of the Maximus 8
formula is a big win in my book as the
rog armor appears ferociously badass
without overdoing it or seeming tacky
one of the formulas ki cosmetic features
is a neutral black and silver color
scheme which deviates from the red
accents traditionally found on ROG
offerings this design choice serves to
complement the board's built-in RGB LEDs
so the consumers finally have a
motherboard that looks good with any
color on the spectrum as you and I both
know having RGB lighting on a component
that has a loud color scheme is kind of
like going to Hometown Buffet on a
strict vegan diet it's kind of pointless
unless you're really into salad or
something I'm always amazed to see how
many vendors miss this simple concept
but fortunately asus has nailed this one
on the head putting the RGB stuff on
pause for now here's a look at the LGA
1151 socket for Intel Core 6 gen skylake
CPUs I've been informed that without
this the motherboard will not work the
extreme engine digi+ vrm features micro
fine alloy chokes next fed MOSFETs and
10k black metallic capacitors a great
reminder that the more patented words
you use to describe your components the
better they are for those of you with an
appetite for liquid cooling asus has
teamed up with EK to deliver a beautiful
and functional water block for your vr m
the inlet and outlet support G and a
quarter inch fittings and while I
haven't dissected the block myself a
great review I found on bit tech
praise the heatsink for making direct
contact with the vrn whereas other
integrated blocks often see less
coverage than women's golf when testing
the block with a custom loop and 240
millimeter radiator the bit tech crew
found the VRMs to run 5 degrees celsius
cooler than air alone I'd call that a
success and having ek in the mix
certainly gives us water block some
street cred whether you're cooling on
air or liquid for ram we have four ddr4
slots which support XMP profiles dual
channel memory a 64 gig max capacity and
speeds up to 37 33 megahertz PCIe
connectivity includes 3 gen 2x1 slots
and 3 gen 3 by 16 slots supporting to a
SLI and 3-way crossfire with the
following operating speeds you see here
based on your GPU configuration in its
usual spot our z170 chipset hides behind
a lovely brushed metallic piece of rog
armor as we'll see in a moment the RGB
integration here is fantastic giving
this chipset a lot more curb appeal than
this one on the storage front we get six
SATA six ports running off z170 and two
additional SATA six powered by an as
midi controller you also get a pair of
SATA Express ports and a single u2 for
nvme storage devices since PCIe lanes
don't grow on trees
the u2 and one of the SATA Express ports
share bandwidth with the m2 slot that's
hidden by a removable cover here both
SATA and PCIe gen3 buy four drives up to
110 millimeters in length are supported
one of our SATA 6 ports is also sharing
its bandwidth with the bottom PCIe by 16
slot which is set to X 2 speed by
default we have rog supreme FX onboard
sound chip equipped with a beefed up amp
deck and ninja con capacitors quality
sounded crystal clear and I was able to
hit a nice max volume with my 250 ohm DT
880 pros to enhance the listening
experience further sonic studio 2 lets
users optimize their sound profile for
gaming or inferior forms of
entertainment familiar onboard features
include a debug led with error code
output for assistive troubleshooting and
backlit power and reset buttons the ever
so useful memo K button also makes its
return to help correct certain
initialization or frequency issues with
your DRAM that prevent your system from
posting here's a look at our four PWM
chassis fan headers
- more for the CPU cooler and a
dedicated header for a i/o water cool
pumps you also get 3t sensor connectors
for hooking up optional temperature
leads to monitor your systems thermals
other features include two USB two and
two USB 3 headers and I particularly
like the right angle orientation of this
connector for cleaner cable routing now
one of the more recent additions to ROG
boards is a dedicated built-in header
for RGB LED strips running an LED strip
off the motherboard instead of directly
from the power supply not only
simplifies cable management but allows
users to control the LED strip via the
motherboards built-in software but more
on that later on the rear i/o we get
buttons for clearing the CMOS and
flashing the BIOS connectors with
included antenna for AC Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth and DisplayPort and HDMI video
outs with increasing USB 3 requirements
of upcoming VR headsets it's nice to see
no less than 6 USB 3 ports on the
formula and there's even 2 USB 3.1 ports
in the form of a type a and type C one
of the USB 3 port supports key bot 2 a
nifty Asus feature that lets you assign
macros and functions to your keyboard
for things like one press CPU
overclocking or booting straight into
the BIOS finally a ps2 port and audio
jacks with optical s/pdif out whoa that
was a huge info dump that I just took on
your chest guys but don't hit up red
tube just yet because we are finally
ready to power this board up and check
out its RGB fixon so let's kick it over
to vlog Kyle for a lighting demo using
the asus or a software
hey thanks script cow how's it going
guys so right here you can see I've
already got a system going with the
Maximus 8 formula we've also got a
couple RGB LED strips from cable mod
that are already wired up now the
motherboard comes with an 80 centimeter
long adapter so that you can pretty much
route the LEDs wherever you want in your
case and that's pretty much just wired
directly into that RGB header on the
board so yeah this is pretty much our
setup right now and as you can see we've
got a red theme going traditional
ROG colors and that actually goes for
both the RGB strips as well as the LEDs
on the motherboard they are matching
because then the Ora software here we
have this little box check that says
sync LED effects so that's going to sync
both of those elements and any color I
change this little wheel to boom the
whole entire system both of those L
it's will will respond accordingly in
sync now now you do have the option to
unsink it if you want to go ahead and
switch things up and have have both of
these sections operate independently of
each other for example if you want the
motherboard to be all pink and stuff you
can go over to your header which
obviously controls your RGB strips and
set that to a different color just click
apply there you go you've got a
brightness bar over here this bar over
here is if you just want the color white
and you can adjust the brightness there
as well and then beyond that you have
some varying effects here so not only if
we wanted it a blue but if we wanted to
if we wanted the RGB strips to be blue
while breathing you could do that go
back over to the logo and or they call
it logo but it's pretty much all the RGB
s on the motherboard we're gonna make
this yellow and we're gonna make it
strobe baby strobe on that alone so now
you've got the blue breathing on the RGB
strips and you've got yellow strobing
seizure-inducing goodness on the
motherboard
and as you can see on the motherboard
we've got the chipset that lights up as
well as the formula logo in the center
the branding the middle there and then
also we've got a nice strip by the BRM
kind of by your rear i/o there and I
think they look pretty nice I mean that
by far my favorite is the chipset I
think the chipset just looks really
awesome it's a very even coat of
lighting the formula the other two are
kind of spotty I mean you can kind of
tell where the LEDs are there's like hot
spots that you can that are somewhat
visible behind that translucent cutout
on the ROG armor there and I would have
liked to see a little bit more even coat
of light as we see on the chipset but
overall they look really nice I'm going
to go ahead and stop the the strobing
before I give myself a seizure we'll do
some more gentle breathing and why don't
we go ahead and sync these because I
think it just looks a little bit nicer
when everything is matchy matchy alright
so here's here's a quick look at the
breathing boom the LEDs turn all the way
off and then they they pulse back up you
guys already saw strobing unfortunately
there's no way to adjust the speed or
the rate at which these LEDs breathe or
strobe for that
or any there's no speed adjustment for
any of these effects and it would have
been nice to see some of that
implemented as well but what can you do
maybe a patch update will fix that ACS
if you're listening to us hear our plea
so you've got color cycle as well and I
was a bit disappointed on this one I'm
not sure if there's anything else at
play here other than the software being
relatively new but yeah as you can see
the RGB s are the LEDs on the
motherboard aren't exactly in sync at
all with the LED strips and that's kind
of a bummer there are some moments like
right here where they're both the same I
think that's just kind of out of luck
but for the most part they're pretty
much missing each other left and right
and it's kind of too bad we've also got
music effects you guys are familiar with
that I'm not going to demo that but you
know music plays on your desktop or
whatever in Windows and then the lamp
the lights dance around and everyone's
happy and then lastly we've got CPU
temperature here this is also pretty
common these days with the beefed-up RGB
LED strips or kits we've also seen this
in the NZXT hue plus where your your LED
color changes based on the temperature
of your CPU and I don't believe you can
customize the colors of these various
temperatures you're pretty much just
stuck with green yellow and red and
that's pretty much it for aura I mean
it's a very simple software it's still
fairly new so you know I think it's
going to be some time until we see a bit
more functionality which would be really
nice as long as they can fix that color
cycle issue I think this is pretty solid
all around as for the LEDs on the
motherboard like I said before I do wish
those hotspots weren't as noticeable but
for the most part they look really nice
and the they are super accurate in terms
of matching with the RGB LED strips
which is really important for something
like this so altogether nice job asus
and why don't we go ahead and kick it
back over to script cow all right thank
you blog Kyle for shedding some light on
those LEDs okay all right so to sum up
the Maximus 8 formula has a lot of
things going for it
superb storage options water cooling
integration and healthy features serving
both form and function are all aspects
of the board from which enthusiasts will
benefit as is the case with ROG boards
users can also
expects top-notch build quality and a
smorgasbord of useful software
personally the new stealthy look falls
right in line with my taste and I have
to commend Asus again for making a color
neutral motherboard that gives users
free range over the RGB spectrum what's
more is that they've managed to hit a
Goldilocks sweet spot here where the RGB
lighting gives your system a noticeable
facelift without stealing the show
frankly the only big concern I can see
most people having with this board is
the price being the first really good
RGB motherboard on the market clearly
comes with a premium and enthusiasts
will have to decide for themselves
whether to adopt now or wait for prices
to fall one such boards become more
mainstream as for those of you who have
the means I reckon you'll be making
sweet socketed love to this board long
before it ever reaches your chassis
hashtag sloppy seconds but that is gonna
wrap it up for now guys let me know what
