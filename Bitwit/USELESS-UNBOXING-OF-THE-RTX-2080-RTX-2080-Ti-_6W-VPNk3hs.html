NZXT brings even more possibilities to
your setup with addressable RGB
underglow cable combs and monitor
lighting with a unique ambient mode that
pulls colors from your primary display
to create a one-of-a-kind gaming
experience check out everything q2 has
to offer in the link below what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel
today is quite exciting because we
finally get to unbox these bad boys from
Nvidia - brand new GPUs based on the
neutering GPU architecture on the 12
nanometer process today we'll be looking
at the RT x 2080 and the RT x 20 ATT I
now of course the embargo for the actual
review and performance is later down the
line but it's right around the corner so
stay tuned for that well at least get to
take a closer look at both these cards
today which I'm pretty excited about
because they did have them on display at
the streaming event during Gamescom but
they were all behind glass and I
couldn't really get it get my hands on
them so I'm pretty stoked about that
additionally the RT X prefix on both
these cards as most of us know by now
indicates real time ray tracing
capabilities which is going to give us
more realistic images in regards to how
light behaves shadows reflections that
sort of thing NVIDIA has already shown
us a bunch of impressive demo so far and
of course there's other questions to
consider about this launch like what
kind of performance cost will be
incurred from enabling RT X or what
about the actual raw performance of
these cards is that going to be is RT X
alone gonna be enough to justify the
sort of hefty price tags associated with
this launch so we'll discuss that a
little bit more later on but for now
let's just take a look at the cards
starting with the RT X 2080 I'm gonna
leave this bad boy the ti for later
we'll save that one for last
nice little packaging very very familiar
from the 10 series launch botta bing
botta boom here we go o money shot Hey
look at that alright okay cool very
simple elegant packaging we've got a
little little tag on here this serial
number I'm not sure whatever this is new
I don't like it
out rip headphone users not the kind of
plastic feel that we want here so here
she is
RTX 2080 in the flesh and it's it's
quite heavy this feels a little bit
heavier actually than the on the
predecessor GTX 1080
you've got the sort of dual fan design
here totally ditching that blower style
enclosed shroud I should also mention
that the spatters Edition card all the
founders Edition cards as far as we know
our factory overclocked by Nvidia so
they're actually operating outside of
the reference spec for the first time I
believe the basin boost clock here is
fifteen hundred and fifteen megahertz
and 1800 megahertz respectively
we've also got twenty nine hundred and
forty four CUDA cores the card features
eight gigs of gdb are six memory on a
256 bit bus that's at 14 gigabits per
second giving us a total of four hundred
and forty eight gigabytes per second of
memory bandwidth TDP is 225 watts you
can also see that we've got a six pin
and an eight pin power connector right
there so definitely a little bit more
than the GTX 1080 with its single 8 pin
plug this is obviously the side of the
GPU that most people will see once
installing it in their systems and
you've got your geforce r-tx branding
there that's gonna be illuminated in
green once it's powered on it also got
like black coated heat sinks I don't
know if it's powder coated or whatnot
but the the actual Finn stack is nice
and black kind of gives it a cool
stealthy vibe as opposed to your
traditional silvery unfinished aluminum
and you've also got again these these
fans I believe they're I don't know
let's measure these fans really quick 90
millimeters okay I think that's what I
suspected 90 millimeter fans and you've
got this sort of large gap in the middle
with the RT X 2080 branding there as
well on the back you've got your RT X
2080 branded backplate which is nice and
silver kind of I believe this is
aluminum as well we also have sort of a
unibody design like the the backplate
almost looks like it seamlessly connects
to the front of the shroud it's
definitely a nice refreshing change from
the previous founders edition cards
those those were getting a little bit
repetitive so Nvidia really did shake
things up for this launch when I first
saw this card I was like where the heck
is the SLI finger it's actually under a
captain
there's a sort of cap that's integrated
to be part of the design of the card
that you just pull out like so tool list
and stuff and there's your redesigned
env link SLI bridge so you can do up to
two a SLI with these cards I don't have
the new bridge on me right now to show
you guys but I'll throw up a picture or
something take a look at the rear i/o
here we have some pretty nice
connectivity options with three
DisplayPort 1.4 meaning we can now do 8k
at 60 Hertz not sure how many people are
going to utilize that I'm sure someone
will but more importantly or I think
more relevant to to us right now as
gamers is 4k at 120 Hertz finally we're
able to hit that that bandwidth with
with 1.4 so that's really nice we also
have hdmi 2.0 be just one of those and
then a USB type-c that's actually going
to be our virtual link connector for
next generation of HMDs or virtual
reality headsets that way you can
basically link up your entire headset
with just a single USB type-c cable and
it doesn't eat up one of your video
ports as well so that'll be pretty cool
to try out in the future that's pretty
much the card
guys let's should we move on to the r-tx
20 atti yes we should I answered my own
question I wasn't really asking you it's
rhetorical
coming from the r-tx 2080 probably won't
see a whole lot different on this card a
lot of the same here oh that never gets
old though there it is hey hey this one
gets plastic wrap on it
what look at that showing your your TI
privilege right now mister card there it
is now I already looked at the spec
sheet and stuff so I kind of already
know this going in but I just want to
verify in person now that I've got the
cards here they are in fact the exact
same dimensions in every way length
width and height I guess you won't run
into any clearance issues with one if
you can avoid them with the other so
good to know same set of i/o the i/o is
is referenced here so that's not going
to change unless we see an ad board
partner fiddle with it I mean physically
the card is exactly the same as the r-tx
2080 with just a couple minor exceptions
of course you've got the branding
difference with the TI there and also
the power delivery requirements we've
got 2 8 pins compared
- again an eight pin and a six pin on
the r-tx 2080s so that also makes sense
because the r-tx 28 ET i does have a
slightly higher TDP of 260 watts i guess
i should also run down some of the basic
specs here since i did it for the RT x
2080 we have 40 352 cuda cores a bass
and boost clock of thirteen hundred and
fifty and sixteen hundred and thirty
five megahertz respectively
again this is factory overclocked by
nvidia and we also have eleven gigabytes
of gddr5 it's per second on a three
hundred and fifty two-bit bus compared
to the r-tx 2080s
256 bit bus and that gives us a total of
six hundred and sixteen gigabytes per
second of effective memory bandwidth
okay alright so I think we've googled
over these cards long enough here they
are very pretty
I'll give them that but let's briefly
talk about this launch wrap in this
video up here let's talk about this
launch and what makes it so different
than other launches we've seen from
Nvidia in the past for starters if I'm
talking about myself personally if I'm
dropping a few hundred dollars on the
high end graphics card I usually care
way more about performance about raw FPS
Loven performance than I do about you
know something like rate racing
technology and better image quality and
things like that and I feel like a lot
of gamers feel the same way based on all
the social media posts and the forum
post that I've read over the last few
weeks I think we're all kind of on the
same page in that regard not all of us
but I think the majority of us and so if
that's the case then let's look at the
facts the GTX 980 launched at an MSRP of
five hundred and forty nine dollars and
then the GTX 1080 its successor launched
at the same price of five hundred and
forty nine dollars but it completely
annihilated the GTX 980 in terms of
performance thirty to forty percent ish
on average was the sort of uplift that
you saw from that 10 series card it was
it was phenomenal and now we have the RT
X 2080 replacing the GTX 1080 which is
not the same price it is a hundred and
fifty dollars more expensive starting at
$6.99
so the RT X 2080 has a lot to prove
right now it has to annihilate the GTX
1080 and then annihilate it again
when we're talking about raw performance
and I don't think for most gamers that
any amount of ray-tracing capability is
going to make up for that nvidia also
recently confirmed that both pascal and
Turing would coexist for the rest of
this year which is also a unique trait
to this launch in particular it's kind
of interesting because pascal if you
look at the gtx 980ti pricing right now
it's ranging from 650 to 750 dollars
there abouts which is right in line with
the starting price of the r-tx 2080 so
if this card launches at 699 it's going
to compete in price with the gtx 1080i
and if one is faster than the other then
people will just buy the faster card so
two things could either happen there
either the gtx 1080 TI pricing will drop
or it won't drop and you won't be able
to find the r-tx 2084 it's starting
price of $6.99 which would really really
suck and then everything kind of goes
double for the r-tx 2080 ti here
starting at $1000 it's just it's an
unbelievable price that is gonna require
unbelievable performance this thing will
have to absolutely blow us away in terms
of its raw frame killing abilities in
order for gamers to really pull out
their wallets otherwise I think we got
no dice there so those are my thoughts
you guys let me know if your thoughts
line up at all with what I'm saying here
if I'm totally off-base feel free to
leave your feedback in the comments
below
apart from that guys stay tuned for my
full review on both of these cards
