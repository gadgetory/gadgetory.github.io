recently caught wind of a Kickstarter
campaign for the anchor cable which is
advertised as being the last charging
cable you will ever need and the
campaign was a huge hit I mean they
raised over 250,000 US dollars by over
4,500 backers but as we all know just
because a crowdfunding campaign is
successful doesn't necessarily mean that
the product is any good so when the
company reached out to me recently and
asked if I would check out a review
sample I said what the heck let's go
ahead and put their bold claims to the
test and see if this product actually
delivers the inner max Sabre a full
tower chassis features premium RGB sync
lighting included RGB strips and three
pre-installed twister bearing RGB fans
enjoy a tempered glass window power
supply shroud and extensive water
cooling support with two included front
panel options for prioritizing silence
or airflow compromise nothing with the
enter max a beret you can learn more by
clicking the link below now I'm not
exactly sure what the early bird special
was for this cable when the campaign was
still alive but it looks like it's
currently going for around 32 US dollars
which is really steep for a charging
cable in my opinion especially because
the one that I've been using for the
last year I got for about eight dollars
on Amazon and it's still one of the best
cables I've ever encountered so this
thing has a lot of explaining to do the
cable measures four feet long which I
think for most people four feet is a
perfect length for a charging cable like
this so it's not too long not too short
definitely gets the goldilocks award in
that arena there's also this nice steel
casing that runs the entire span of the
cable for a couple reasons one is
protection obviously this is a copper
wire at its core and there's a rubber
casing around that and then a steel
casing on the very outside so you kind
of get this exoskeleton that provides
additional protection the other benefit
of a steel casing is that it makes the
cable virtually tangle free and I've
tested this myself by tying it up in a
giant knot and no matter what I do it
pulls apart very easily in a matter of
seconds because there's simply not much
friction going on here like you'd find
with a rubber or even a braided cable
now I don't think the steel exoskeleton
has much to do with this but the cable
is advertised as being incredibly
durable and there was actually a test on
the Kickstarter page that shows a
machine bending the cable in the same
spot over and over until the cable fails
and they found that it was actually able
to bend over 60,000 times whereas
competing cables that they tested it
against only lasted about a quarter of
that now obviously I have no way of
validating this on my own but it is a
fairly compelling demo if it's true it's
also instilling enough confidence in the
company to offer a lifetime warranty
with this product as far as the
interface on this thing goes we have a
simple USB type a connector on one end
and a neodymium magnet on the other and
this package actually came included with
three magnetic tips which also have gold
contacts on them one for a USB type-c
another for lightning and micro USB so I
guess the idea here is that you can
interchange these tips as you see fit
which maybe explains why they're
advertising this to be the last cable
you'll ever need because it has these
various connectors now while I
understand the concept here and I
appreciate the flexibility it offers
there's a part of me that also thinks
this is kind of silly because the more I
use these types of cables the more I
find myself just kind of popping on the
one connector that I really need and
sort of forgetting about the other two
these kind of just go in as in a drawer
somewhere and you know god forbid that
get lost or something
negating the whole point of this sort of
flexible design now what I see a lot of
people doing with these removable
magnetic tips is they'll actually leave
the tip inside of their phone so that
when it's time to charge they just have
to hold the cable near and it'll
automatically snap and they don't have
to actually shove anything into their
phones very easy but the problem with
that is that these are magnets right so
they have to be facing the correct way
otherwise they will repel and will not
connect and what that essentially does
is it removes one of the greatest
features of connectors like type-c and
lightning which is that they're
reversible so this all of a sudden
becomes a keyed connector that I'm not
too hot about so if I were using this
exact cable I would probably just leave
the tip connected to the cable itself at
all times the other thing we should take
a look at are the magnets themselves
which are advertised as being incredibly
strong there's even gifts on the on the
Kickstarter page of people like wasting
or carrying large kitchen knives with a
single cable just to show how powerful
they are
but it's all a lie because these are
some of the weakest magnets I've ever
encountered especially for a product
that relies heavily on good magnetism I
mean the thing can't even hold its own
weight like without anything plugged in
if I just drop the cable like this
holding the phone at a 45 degree angle
immediately causes the cable to come
undone even though it's still hanging on
there by a thread
there's no charging happening at this
point and it's been a very frustrating
experience for me so far trying to get
this thing to stick especially in the
car where I use Android auto all the
time to basically project my phone's
navigation and music onto the screen in
my car
all is fine and dandy when it's you know
sitting on the car mount but as soon as
I remove my phone from that car mount
for whatever reason and go to look at it
the cable disconnects and immediately my
music and navigation are killed and it
takes me literally like thirty Seconds
to a minute to get it all back up
so it's it's been incredibly annoying
and honestly it's kind of a deal breaker
for the product and in fact it's
definitely a deal breaker for this
product it had a lot of good things
going for it but the magnets at the end
of the day are just so nice Lee I've
even found the cable disconnecting when
simply putting the phone down on a desk
you really have to like look and make
sure that it's actually connected in
that the gold contacts are making
contact which is just a huge pain in the
ass my solution to this problem would be
to ditch the magnets altogether and
perhaps opt for threaded tips that you
can simply screw onto the cable that way
you get a rock-solid connection that's
not going to disconnect every five
seconds to make you want to pull your
hair out but still also take advantage
of the interchangeability of the various
tips so I don't know until they fix this
problem I honestly cannot say I'd
recommend this product especially for a
steep 30-plus dollar price tag on the
bright side it does support 2.4 amp
charging so at least there's one feature
that works as advertised and that's it
guys thank you very much for watching
this short little review of the anchor
cable if you guys have any opinions
thoughts concerns let me know in the
comments below curious to hear what you
guys have to say about it also toss me a
look on the video if you enjoyed it and
get subscribed for more tech stuff
coming at you really soon and follow me
on flip lane if you wanna watch my
videos a week early without ads for 3
bucks a month
I'll put a link for that in the video
description until next time guys thank
you so much for tuning in have
yourselves Goodwin and I'll see y'all in
the next video
hey at least it makes a ugly necklace
you know that's a feature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
