what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well so
today's video is gonna be super quick
and easy because I've actually gotta hop
on a plane first thing tomorrow morning
for PAX East and hopefully I'll see some
of you guys there should be a lot of fun
but in the meantime I thought it'd be
cool to conduct a little experiment on
my grandpa who has a fairly thick Thai
accent and it can be kind of tricky to
understand what he's saying sometimes so
right here I've got the Google home and
an Amazon Alexa with a list of 8 or 9
questions that I'm gonna actually have
him read off to both of these devices so
we can see which one has the harder time
understanding it again super simple and
straightforward concept here but it
should be pretty entertaining so I'm
gonna go ahead and bring him in and
we'll see what happens now the exercise

understanding right now please try a
little later sing me a song
I love singing okay cool cool and I'll
mark that Alexa she is pretty amazing
you're wrong
well that was everything I hoped and
dreamed it would be
but how did we do here the Google home
actually performed quite well
answering eight out of nine questions
correctly whereas the Amazon echo
struggled a little bit only answering
four out of the nine questions right I
should also mention that whether or not
the Amazon echo answered a question
correctly it did take anywhere from
three to four times longer to give an
answer than the Google home which was
almost instantaneously every time so I
think the winner is pretty clear here
got to give the victory point to the
Google home at least when it comes to
deciphering fake Thai accents but that's
gonna do it for now guys if you enjoyed
the video toss a like on it and feel
free to check me out on Flo plain if you
want to watch my videos a whole week
