2016 is brought to you by need for seat
go to need for seat USA comp for the
ultimate gaming chair experience for
your desk in office and Corsair they
make good products and you should buy
them what's up guys we are continuing
our coverage of CES 2016 here in Las
Vegas and we have stopped by the Corsair
booth they've got a lot of cool stuff
here the first of which that I want to
talk about today is their Corsair
Bulldog now many of you guys have
already seen this at CES 2015 or
Computex 20 oh I disagree with
everything that Kyle has said I hi Paul
what do you what are you doing here oh
I'm just I'm at Computex no yes where is
he yes I thought it was a coffee - I've
been drinking haven't you late in the
day and I'm tired yeah we're all kind of
tired okay hi bye everyone on watching
awesomesauce Network go subscribe to
Paul's channel everyone but what we
simply have here is a really awesome
home theater PC that isn't kind of your
average case for a living room
environment Corsair has done a lot of
new implementations here including a
small form-factor
power supply that's 600 watts and
definitely power anything like a gtx
980ti
and this is really kind of tailored for
4k gaming in your living room
so they've also done with like a new
blackout design so they've got this kind
of piano black front with a no more red
trim on the side like we saw on Computex
so it's just built to fit into your
living room so it doesn't really stand
out too much so a really nice subtle
look there they've also got their SF
cooler mini ITX low profile uses 120
millimeter blower style fan to eject hot
air through a radiator out the back of
the case so that heat isn't being
dispersed or circulating in the rest of
the chassis they've also got - I believe
there's 292 millimeter fans that are
providing direct airflow healthy airflow
and it's kind of an open ventilation you
can see a lot of mesh paneling on the
sides which really indicates that you
can game like like a champ here with
overclocking to boot and your thermals
are gonna be pretty damn awesome so all
together really promising stuff why
don't we go ahead and see what else
Corsair has to offer all right guys now
we're taking a look at the spec Alfa
case really low price point actually 80
bucks
but for what you get it's actually a
pretty good deal you can see it's full
ATX motherboard support you can also
pretty put in a pretty lengthy graphics
card but what's really cool here is that
they've removed the five and a quarter
inch base completely in place of some
mounting mounting points at the front
for a 240 millimeter radiator you can
also fit 120 at the back which pretty
awesome radiator support for just an $80
case also I will say that the the drive
cage right here it supports two three
and a half inch one two three three
three and a half inch drives you also
get some mounting points for SSDs around
the back
this cage can be removed quite easily
with two removable screws you can take
that out for a fresher air flow or if
you want to do like a push-pull radiator
configuration at the front there so all
together really nice stuff but when we
go ahead and move on to the next case
all right now we've got a few new
carbide Series cases this is the 400 C
they also have the 400 q which stands
for quiet addition the quiet addition is
pretty much lined with sound dampening
material on all sides but this one
actually has a really nice window this
is the 400 C again very nice acrylic
panel it doesn't seem very like scratch
prone so that's that's kind of good I
like the way it opens is very clean and
it's like a full side to side entry way
to be innards of your case so you can
really show off the B inside you can see
right here we've got a 240 millimeter
radiator with with push-pull mind.you
and some full-size graphics cards you do
get several I think seven expansion
slots so you can pump in you know
multi-gpu setups as you see fit now you
also do have some mounting points at the
top there those are two 140 s I believe
you can also do two 120 s let me go
ahead and check that it does look like
you can do yes you can do either one and
they are flexible mounting strips so
that you can slide them for potential
radiator clearance if you so choose you
also get a nice magnetic dust filter at
the top so you can have best of both
worlds you can include an a io with the
radio at the top but you don't have to
sacrifice any kind of dust build-up or
accumulation which is really nice to see
they've also got this kind of lower
compartment here which hides your power
supply and a small drive cage which
holds a couple three and a half inch
drives again you get some SSD mounting
points at the back but those drive cages
down below can also hold SSDs if you so
wish also this kind of enclosure here is
modular it's two pieces which gives you
a little bit more flexibility when your
building gives it an easier building
process and it also kind of covers up
any kind of cable mess or clutter if you
don't wish to show off those lowly
components there but that is pretty much
gonna do it for this booth at Corsair
