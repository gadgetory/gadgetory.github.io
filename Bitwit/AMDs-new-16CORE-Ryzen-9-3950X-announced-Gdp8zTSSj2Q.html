brotherbrother bla all right all right
here we go
am I in am I in am I on okay I think
we're live all right Wow that quality
looks like hot garbage but hopefully
that's just on my end okay I'm back
because I had to I had to stop yes
that's right yeah I had to stop
momentarily to go kill Lyle so he's dead
so sorry about that but who knows maybe
you'll maybe you'll see his ghosts haunt
you and your dreams or something but the
reason why I came back here is because I
completely forgot one of the juiciest
moments of III s announcements from AMD
which is their friggin 16-core 3950 X
which is a risin nine part the reason
why I forgot it is because I don't
really have an excuse I went to bed at
6:30 a.m. I woke up at 2:00 p.m.
because damn jet lag still reeling in
that from from Taiwan but yeah let's
just quickly go over this because it's
huge news that's probably the biggest
piece of excitement from from AMD's
announcements and yeah let's let's go
over this really quick 749 this is an
article from Engadget so thanks thanks
and gadget this is a pretty big headline
here seven hundred and forty nine dollar
rise in 939 50x is the world's first 16
core gaming CPU which is technically
true because previously you can only
find 16 cores on say the high-end
desktop platforms which were not really
tailored or targeted at gaming segments
so this is huge news I mean it really
just goes to show how committed AMD is
to moving the CPU industry forward when
you look at Intel for the last you know
at least pre rise in pre 1st gen rise
and Intel was like on 4 cores but they
just kept rolling out four core CPUs
year after year after year for like a
decade and now here in just like two
generations over like three generations
we're seeing AMD go from eight cores
right out of
gate to 12 cores and then 16 cores
actually they made that leap from 8 to
12 and 16 in one generation which is
unheard of from the competition
absolutely unheard of and I think Intel
is they've got to be shaking in their
boots right about now I mean how could
they not the competition is so it's been
brought people it's been so brought and
749 yeah that's that's a lot for a
gaming CPU it definitely is but think
about how multifaceted this is with with
16 cores and 36 threads this isn't just
a gaming CPU anymore this is
ridiculously overpowered streaming chip
and editing chip the amount of
multitasking you can do with this and
the options here are pretty limitless so
it's very exciting you got four point
seven gigahertz boost with 72 megabytes
of cache that's a whopping amount of
cash cash money is what AMD's gonna be
drowning in I suspect with this launch
but yeah I was I was actually kind of
explaining to wifey sauce earlier this
whole AMD versus Intel thing and why
this is such a huge launch and why
people are so just so hyped for Verizon
right now and for AMD because they're
they're finally bringing the competition
back to the CPU space and consumers are
I think consumers have been sick of
getting kind of dict around by Intel in
the CPU space for so long because
they've just been sort of sitting on a
gold mine
you know Intel has the capability they
have the capacity they have the
technology to make insanely good
powerful competitive products but they
have just been slacking not because they
don't have the means but just because
there's been no fire under their ass to
get them to make competitive products
again until now so yeah I guess more
will have to wait and see what Intel's
response to this is gonna be obviously
we already have some some ideas what's
what's coming but this is crazy guys 16
course I don't know does this also to
some degree conflict or compete with the
thread Ripper platform now I mean
obviously you've still got
like quad-channel memory and a lot of
PCIe lanes for 4x X 399 but this is
looking really compelling there it is so
I think that's all I really wanted to
say just wanted to point that out
I couldn't end this little bit of live
streaming without mentioning the 16 core
so 39 50 X hopefully I'll get a sample
for you guys and and test the crap out
of it I know a lot of other press will
too so make sure to check out those
reviews also but I'm out I'm gonna go
away again this is my second sign-off
hopefully if there's anything now
anything else that I missed let me know
now cuz I ain't coming back after this
I'm gonna go take a shower and start my
day at 6 p.m. got a hate jet lag ok
thank you guys very much again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
