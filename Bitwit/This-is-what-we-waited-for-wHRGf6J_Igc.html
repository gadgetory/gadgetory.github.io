benchmarks we finally get to look at the
performance of the Radeon seven from AMD
not just to do a stupid unboxing we're
gonna look at performance the numbers
the data is very exciting we're gonna be
stacking it up against the competition
which would be an RT X 2080 from Nvidia
as well as a GTX 1080 I'm only testing
these three cards guys mainly because
the RCX 2080 and this card are about the
same price at 699 us and the gtx 980ti
as most of us know is on par or
comparable in performance - and our TX
2080 so we're gonna be looking at all
three just to get us a better idea of
which one you should be spending your
money on if you're in the market that is
for a high-end graphics card so without
further ado let's get started so now
that I have my brand agnostic jacket on
we can begin this review by talking
about some of the essentials world's
first seven nanometer gaming GPU on Vega
xx let's take a look at the specs and
how it compares to the competition that
we're testing today you can see here
we've got thirty 840 SPS or streaming
processors on Radeon seven to twenty 944
CUDA cores on the r-tx twenty eighty
founders Edition and thirty 584 CUDA
cores on the GTX 1080 TI founders
Edition both the Radeon seven and the
r-tx twenty eighty or max now at around
1800 megahertz for their boost / peak
clock frequencies - where the Radeon
seven really shines is with its memory
having 16 gigs of HBM - compared to just
half that I'll be out of GTD are six
with the RT X 2080 founders of dition
and even though it's an older card the
gtx 980ti also has more memory than the
RT x 2080
although it's gddr5 x i should say on a
thinner bus of 352 bit with 484
gigabytes a second and memory bandwidth
as opposed to 448 gigabytes a second on
the RT x 2080 and a whopping one
terabyte a second on Radeon 7 with the
help also of that 4096 bit bus woo 300
watt TDP for the Radeon 7 which is quite
a bit higher than the competition and as
I mentioned we are seeing a 699 u.s.
dollar price tag for the Radeon 7 and
the RT X 28 efe the GTX 1080 Ti is in a
weird spot right now because it's not
quite in production anymore and so you
can't really find it for cheaper than
around 850 dollars and that's looking on
Amazon and Newegg within the US I
wouldn't recommend anyone go out and pay
that price
but again we're comparing it to the
other two cards today because it's
comparable in performance to NRT X 2080
and I'm curious to see how it stacks up
against the new Radeon seven here's a
look at the testing hardware you can see
I use an open-air testbed with an Intel
Core I 999 hundred K at five gigahertz
that's overclocked nicely on the Asus
Prime's III 90 a with 16 gigs of GCL
sniper XP or four at 3400 speed now I
want to talk about a couple things
before we just jump into the benchmarks
the first thing is that I have heard
through my little birds through the
grapevine that some reviewers are having
really bad behavioral issues with their
Radeon seven samples I don't want to say
any names and I'm not gonna speak to
exactly what those issues have been I
can only speak on behalf of my own
experiences and we still don't know if
this is just some bad samples that were
sent out to press or if these problems
could pour out into the retail that
consumers are buying we don't know yet
now a lot of the benchmarks I use are
maybe two or three minutes long you know
maybe five minutes of the most which
isn't really indicative of a real-world
user experience so I decided to actually
pop this card in in-game with it for a
longer than just a couple minutes
starting with GTA 5 at 1440p I played
for about 30 to 40 minutes and what I
saw there was the temperatures getting
quite a bit higher than I saw in any of
my testing because obviously we're
putting a load on the card for a longer
period of time it was actually hitting
up to 94 C in hardware info that being
said I also took a look at my clock
speeds here and noticed a very nice
tightly grouped clock speed range of
anywhere from seventeen hundred and
seventy megahertz to eighteen hundred
and twenty which is right about where it
should be there were no signs of thermal
throttling or anything like that and
overall and most importantly I was
seeing very smooth and stable gameplay
with no issues whatsoever and that was
in GTA 5 again at 1440p switch gears to
about half an hour in resident evil 2
the remake of course at 4k decided to
bump it up to the higher resolution to
see how the card would perform I was
seeing very consistent clock speeds this
time in the seventeen hundred and sixty
to the eighteen hundred megahertz range
quite a bit lower than in GTA 5 not by a
lot but a little bit because of that
higher temperature of course the clocks
are ramping down a bit so core clock and
even memory clock frequencies were
totally normal but I did encounter a
couple black screens and random lock ups
in the game I would just be playing the
game and all of a sudden it would go
from windowed mode I'm sorry full screen
mode to windowed mode and it would pause
the game definitely shouldn't be
happening especially on a $700 graphics
card
that being said I'm currently testing
this with a pre-launch press driver and
I'm really hoping that once public
drivers get released that these sorts of
issues go away completely because it's
just not acceptable
on any new GPU regardless of the amount
you're paying for it if it does fix the
issue then great we can move on and if
not maybe we're looking at a bigger
problem here that certainly requires
further investigation the next thing I
want to address here is the ridiculous
16 gigabytes of memory on the Radeon
seven you need it is it required is it
necessary for gaming can you even
utilize 16 gigs in game well previously
up until this point I would have said no
because I personally had never
experienced that much memory utilization
in any game I had ever tested but since
then I have changed my mind because when
testing Resident Evil 2 at 4k with maxed
out settings this sucker ate nearly 15
gigs of vram and that was only after
half an hour of gaming this is the only
game the first and only game I've ever
seen use anywhere close to that much
memory I think the second place is like
GTA 5 at 4k with maxed out settings that
8 around 10 gigs this is a good showcase
for the Radeon 7 because it demonstrates
that more games are starting to utilize
more memory that being said I don't
think there's an immediate mainstream
need for 16 gigs of beer
I just don't unless you're part of that
small slice of the gamer pie who wants
the game at 4k on all the Triple A games
and max out everything across the board
no holds barred for those users the
Radeon 7 does build a stronger case for
having a ridiculous amount of B Ram
finally I ran 14 different gaming tests
today two of which were 3d mark
benchmarks and then I also ran six
triple-a games at 2560 by 1440 and 3840
by 2160 guys without further ado it is
my pleasure and honor to present to you
the benchmarks for AMD's new flagship
GPU
all right so there you have the bench
marks on top of this I also added up all
of the frames that were rendered across
the board to put into a single chart
that you see here so we can get an
overall look of how these cards stacked
up so at 4k the r-tx 2080 performed 13%
faster on average then the Radeon 7gt X
1080 T I performed about 3 percent
faster than the Radeon 7 at 1440p we see
a slightly larger performance gap
between the cards as to be expected at
the lower resolution with the RT X 2080
performing 16% faster than the Radeon 7
and the GTX 1080i performing about 6.5
percent faster on average than the
Radeon 7 so with that said let's draw
some conclusions right off the bat I
would not recommend buying a new gtx
980ti because even though it
consistently outperforms a Radeon 7 in
my tests it's just not worth the 850
dollars that it's currently being sold
for on sites like Amazon and Newegg
bearing that in mind if you're
comfortable buying used off of say eBay
or something like that then it's a great
deal you can find it for about 4 to 500
dollars right now used and the GTX 280 I
still pumps out tremendous performance
years later here in 2019 so some to
consider now based on the data if you're
just looking for the maximum amount of
gaming performance in terms of frame
rates and 1% lows I have to recommend
the RT X 2080 you're simply getting more
frames per dollar than you are with the
Radeon 7 this is certainly true for
1440p gaming and 2160p gaming today the
reason I say today is because it
probably won't be long before we start
to see more and more titles that require
more than a gigs of VRAM to run at 4k
with maxed out settings but at the end
of the day since the vast majority of
existing titles hardly require that much
memory the 16 gig frame buffer is really
not going to do you nearly as many
favors and in that case you're just
gonna get more bang for your buck more
frames per dollar with an RT X 28 the
last little reminder here guys is that
we only tested the game
performance of this card today so if you
plan to be using it for anything beyond
gaming like ray tracing or 3d rendering
any kind of productivity workstation
workload make sure you look at other
reviews who have tested in those areas
to get a full picture as to whether or
not this card is a good fit for your
play and work needs that's gonna do it
for me guys let me know what you think
about rating on seven in the comments
did it meet exceed or fall short of your
expectations lemme know down below as
always guys toss a look on the video if
you enjoyed it it helps me a lot and get
subscribed to the channel for more tech
stuff coming at you really really soon
have a good one guys thanks for watching
I will see you all in the next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
