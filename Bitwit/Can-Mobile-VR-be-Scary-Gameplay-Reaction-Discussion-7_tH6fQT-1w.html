what's up guys welcome back to the
channel so the topic of today's video is
gonna be slightly different than what I
initially had planned and my first idea
was going to be can you have a decent vr
gaming experience for under 50 bucks and
I was gonna test that out using you know
a $10 Google cardboard and this $20
Bluetooth gamepad that supports Android
and stuff with you know maybe a pair of
$10 earbuds I thought was gonna be a
cool video because I don't really have
much experience with mobile VR and I'm
sure some of you guys might be
interested in something like that but as
soon as I started playing the games and
actually filming the video I was getting
nauseous as how like the motion sickness
was unreal not so much from the head
tracking because I can handle that no
problem but any game that required my
character to actually move any character
movement with the joystick it just
totally made me sick to my stomach and I
could not get through it for the life of
me to film that video so I have since
then changed the topic of today's
content which is going to be canned
mobile VR actually scare you speaking of
course about a horror VR game and the
reason why I'm asking this question is
because it's pretty easy to see how an
oculus rift or an HTC vive could scare
the living daylights out of you by
playing you know a scary game on that
platform because both of those VR
headsets are high-end and they're backed
by high-end hardware with you know
awesome graphics ninety Hertz refresh
rate and things like that
it's easy to really see how you could
get immersed and you know scream your
ass off in a scary game but does it does
the experience get watered down so much
with mobile VR to the point where scary
games are no longer scary where it's
just it's too pixelated or the refresh
rates too low it takes you out of the
experience altogether so I guess that's
what we're going to be experimenting
with today on myself of course the game
that I'm gonna be playing today is
called chair in a room which does not
require your
character to move at all you are simply
static here you're fixed in one point in
the middle of a room and you just have
head tracking which again does not make
me nauseous by itself so we're going to
be doing that it's a it's also available
on HTC vive which I have not played it
on that platform nor have I ever played
the mobile app version before filming
this video so all the reactions that
you're about to see are completely 100%
genuine this has not been faked in any
way you have my word one last thing I
wanted to mention is that the screen
recording app that I use to screen cap
all of the gameplay footage on my phone
doesn't actually have the licensing to
record in-game sound for anything later
than Android 4.0 or something like that
so as a result you're not going to hear
any of the in-game the original in-game
audio but I have replaced that awkward
silence with some scary music in
post-production so bear that in mind you
are going to be missing out on some of
the sound effects that serve as cues and
and actually make it a more immersive
experience for the user but with that
said I'm going to go ahead and fire this
bad boy up and we're gonna see if a
piece of cardboard a smartphone and some
earbuds can scare the living daylights
out of me Cheers
okay what do I do here
I share the room a demo oh shit
things are starting now take a look
around and make yourself familiar with
your surroundings don't mind if I do
chargeable torch use a trigger to use it
torch must be off the charge okay ah
alright you're on your own yeah I
figured so we're here up that's an open
door oh great
love it when the lights turn out that's
fantastic what is that noise from I'm
I'm gonna use oh that's a chair those
are just boxes who cares boxes you're
stupid what the f is that noise if chair
if you're gonna pop out and scare me
just do it already I'm ready for it
ready I've trained all my life oh God
what the fuck no no no no no no no no
what the fuck does that say like idea oh
my god you're right you're right I
shouldn't have shit on mobile VR
this is scariest shit no it's fine it's
really not that bad the the low refresh
rate is keeping me from being fully
immersed is that there before wait why
the cigarette go out I don't like how
slow this flashlight recharges clearly
this does not support Qualcomm quick
charge this is just a game where you
just look you just look around and get
freaked out up shit
liar yeah I get it all right you're
triggered I understand
ah fuck fuck you fuck you no no no no no
no I don't like this why are you for you
ugly you're ugly child no wonder you're
haunted everyone hates you and then
again with the stupid the stupid sounds
stupid Sims why is it those are boxes
that's a thing
stupid baby more boxes okay ah fuck you
son of a bitch that was not there why
why am I doing this why am I doing this
to myself who why do people like this
shit this is stupid this is a I'm on up
I'm on a phone all right there's hands
in multiple places I he's got a really
really wide wingspan his hands were that
far apart
I don't oh god no uh-huh I could really
go for that cigarette right about now oh
no it's making music box noises uh and
now my my light went out now girls

in the room how bad could it be
I I just my mind I don't want to do it
so I leave one thing out it's not
starting rub no wait take a look around
and make yourself familiar surroundings
okay some boxes there it's actually make
me feel a little dizzy

creepy doll right there okay Oh God
okay I'm done playing until playing this
stupid game fucking evil no no please
stop
I want to cry right now what I don't
want to even turn up
I'm surprised coming from that
alright so there you guys have it I
actually wasn't planning to have wifey
sauce being the video she just happened
to walk in the room when I was filming
at the right time or at the wrong time
but pretty cool that we actually got her
reaction in there as well
so if you're still asking yourself can
mobile VR be scary
all right so some closing words before
we wrap this up I did want to mention
that I was using a samsung galaxy s6 for
this test which technically has a higher
resolution per eye than the oculus rift
I believe it's 1440 by 1080 per eye on
this phone which is slightly higher so
resolution is there however that's
really not a huge factor when it comes
to VR so much as the fluidity or the
refresh rate of the image so the picture
I was getting here with 60 Hertz as
opposed to 90 Hertz on a high-end VR
headset which definitely takes a it's a
huge difference it's a huge difference
that really can take you out of the
experience itself and can make you a
little bit more nauseous quite easily
unfortunately I wasn't experiencing that
with chair in a room however I was for
sure with with other games as I had
mentioned so that's probably the biggest
drawback I would say with mobile VR
right now is getting that refresh rate
higher but I think it's probably not
going to be long before we see phones
with 90 Hertz refresh rate specifically
for mobile VR I think without VR there
would probably be no need to have a
refresh rate on a phone that high at
least not so immediately so I think the
right ingredients are there just needs a
little bit more time to catch up to
speed where you can have a really solid
VR experience on your smartphone the
other thing that's a huge proponent to
VR is audio and that's often overlooked
but it's just so important to drawing
you in which is why Nvidia and AMD are
so hard at work at their own VR audio
initiatives and the sound experience
that I had in charity room was pretty
much on par with anything I've had on
the HTC vive for example so that really
allowed me to get immersed into the
atmosphere and quite frankly it allowed
me to get scared so like I said I think
there is huge potential here for mobile
VR I kind of am more of a believer in it
now than I was before doing this little
experiment the last thing I will say is
that the headset itself for $10 Google
cardboard is quite a steal however it's
not the most comfortable obviously it's
not going to endure much of your sweats
and things like that and it's also got a
lot of like light bleed from underneath
the nose piece the nose bridge which can
kind of be rectified actually put some
like paper towel and some foam for my
sweat and stuff there's little things
you can do however there's a bunch of
other mobile VR headsets out there that
are much
are comfortable and solve a lot of these
problems with the cardboard of course
you're gonna pay a little bit more for
those as well but that is going to do it
for now guys thank you so much for
tuning in let me know what you think of
mobile VR this experiments the whole
shindig in the comments below be sure to
toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it subscribe to the channel if
you haven't already have a great weekend
and I will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
