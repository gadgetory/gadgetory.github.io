Buckingham Palace let's see how we got
here
get him get in the shot I think the last
time I ever see you I might let him is
that him
yep I haven't started my blog at all how
should I start buying the same way we
should just have the exact same vlog hey
everyone
Oh
electricity might so our hotel room is
somewhere in here there's just like four
or five different separate buildings
that have all been converted into hotel
rooms and just if you walk out here this
is just an immaculate view of the rest
of the property this is all part of the
same property it's just one massive
estate and it just kind of goes on for
miles some rich white dudes got a level
and look pretty
biddies I'm probably gonna eat you later
actually
we're having dinner right now in this
beautiful lovely courtyard in front of
the hotel and they gave us instructions
on how to make this special cocktail
Anthony just told us what would cordial
is so now we know what court what's
cordial again English kool-aid
that's that's that's the way to make
sense to an American for sure so Dimitri
has been kind of our grand master
barista here and I have no idea how it's
going to turn out he's just garnished it
with some some mint and strawberry you
can be the first to try but he's like
you can burn inside too and a cucumber
good job falls on it too yes delicious
is it really super good it's a little
too sweet to being a summer drink needs
to have a little more citrus so maybe I
need to add more of this oh you think
you're all-pro now Nick you're all did
you know everything he's rambling okay I
stand corrected carry on sir all right
so at this point you guys are probably
wondering well why am I even in London
in the first place actually why am i
home right now because I'm recording
this after the vlog but I'm inserting it
in the middle of the vlog because I
didn't have a chance to record it during
the vlog if that makes sense
anyway I basically was flown out to
London by Nvidia to cover their new
laptops and these new laptops I'm sure
you guys have heard of them already but
I'm just gonna reiterate are going to be
featuring full fledged desktop GPUs
including the GTX 1060 1070 and the 1080
so there's not gonna be any EM at the
end of these they are pretty much gonna
perform on par with the desktop variants
maybe about 10 percent slower but that's
about it we're essentially seeing very
similar specs as the depth of desktop
models including CUDA cores with the
exception of the 1070 which is actually
gonna have more CUDA cores but a slower
clock speed just to make it more mobile
optimized the 1060 the GTX 1060 is also
gonna have a slightly slower clock speed
but the GTX 1080 as far as I know right
now is going to feature pretty much the
same specs across the board clock speed
boost clock CUDA cores as well as gddr5
X memory pretty much every major early M
is going to be releasing their own
product stack different variants of
these particular full desktop GPU
notebooks so this is the first time
NVIDIA is really allowing OMS to factory
overclock the chips as well it'll be
to see how the OEMs approached factory
overclocking in this case since we're
dealing with the smaller form factor and
we're much more constrained for battery
life and thermals and things like that
but more on that in a bit
these chips are also going to be
manually overclockable so that's thanks
to an improved electrical design that
nvidia is implemented dual FET power
supply which is going to be featuring
much higher power density so you can fit
and drive a lot more power to the GPU in
a smaller area and multi phase power
controllers have been added as well and
improved upon there's gonna be power
efficiency more raw performance things
like that there is not gonna be any over
bolting support for obvious reasons
thermals battery life there are just too
many constraints there as well as
affecting the longevity of the chips
themselves now circling back to the
battery life we are gonna be seeing up
to 30% more battery life in the new
Pascal generation of notebooks as we saw
in Maxwell and that's thanks to a number
of factors including just the new FinFET
architecture which is a lot more power
efficient as well as a more refined
version of battery boost this refined
app from Nvidia is going to now allow
users to define a minimum frame rate
that they would like to play their games
at and then the app is going to govern
the clock speed in order to maintain
that frame rate so that it never goes
too far over and it really never goes
under either and any excess performance
is going to be translated into energy
savings and battery life so that's
that's really fun to see there's gonna
be a range of different form factors
based on the OEMs everyone's gonna have
their own line you know asus is gonna
have their rog models pacer is gonna
have the predator who knows but there's
just gonna be a ton of different options
here we're also gonna be seeing g-sync
g-sync makes its return to these
notebooks with up to 120 Hertz at 1920
by 1080 which if you remember in Maxwell
it was 75 Hertz I believe 4g sync at
that resolution but now we're gonna also
gonna be seeing 120 Hertz at 2560 by
1440 which is which I think is a really
cool resolution it's sort of a sweet
spot for for large larger you know 15 to
17 inch notebooks displays because quite
frankly personally I think 4k is just a
little bit insane however I think this
is a really smart move on NVIDIA start
to go with quad HD here especially if
that super super fast refresh rate which
is really cool so those are pretty much
all the talking points that I wanted to
hit for this hard launch guys very
exciting stuff from Nvidia and sorry I
had to squeeze all this into the blog I
just wanted to get all that relevant
information out to you
timely fashion hence the awkward time
traveling that I'm doing right now so on
that note why don't we go ahead and kick
it back to the vlog and see what Paul
and I are up to and good ol London st.
Paul's Cathedral this this trip is just
all about YOU isn't it can I say
according to several signs as well this
is the houses of parliament and this my
friends is the River Thames the Thames
it's spelled differently than it sounds
pronounced ends from watching Mary
Poppins which I have not seen you night
I've not seen since I was like six so
landing on the 10th that sounds very
suggestive hunting you punted me good
last night which is why I'm so naked see
if we've learned so much yes it's been a
very educational trip Tower of London
everyone our
looks kind like a prison actually degree
for the zombie apocalypse though
good old buckingham palace time to give
the Queen my regards here the Queen is
sitting on her throne right now here at
the Buckingham Palace
someone's trying to breach the reach the
gates his lady is totally trying to bust
into Buckingham Palace I think yeah the
guard seemed pretty intimidated so
they're gonna let her in who knows who
knows what kind of danger she wields
I'll look at that that's fancy
alright well god help the Queen god help
her this is the Buckingham statue
Buckingham statue with golden guy on the
top golden guy on the top oh I see but
there's definitely a but those are
tweezers okay four he's got so little
hair in his body
yeah and between his legs Oh Joe Oh kid
Gibby you watch your step watch your
step
Hey look I just I just plucked these
what the hell are you doing here Mickey
alright so again this is Hyde Park and a
pretty famous Park here in London I was
hoping to finally get into this place
but it looks like these gates are just
super tall I don't see any real
practical way around it unless there's
oh there's Paul never mind
you're watching this already out at
least some of them are between those new
10 series desktop CPUs so thank you all
for coming along with me pour learn from
this run and I'll be seeing you guys
very shortly be sure to subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already more tech
stuff as always coming at you really
soon we'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
