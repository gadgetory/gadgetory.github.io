sky by the time Josh finished giving
Kyle the scoop on fractals define nano
ass after all Josh liked to talk a lot
and that's why this is the best mini ITX
case in the world Kyle gave his familiar
nod of approval as he admired his
friends work fighting the urge to flail
his arms like a marionette on speed
which had long been his trademark
actually you kind of nailed you there
come on dude that claim is completely
unfounded and you know it you know
whatever what are the drives go on this
thing
they're back here lust with emotion they
stared longingly into each other's eyes
an unspoken desire but emotion longingly
there was no longingly okay let's let's
just try to yeah right I mean okay so
what else can we stuff in this thing no
dials Freudian slip betrayed his true
emotions his heart taking over for his
mind okay dude I thought you got the
narrator from the Martian audiobook not
fifty shades of gray I know I know man
this is not how I expected this pre-roll
to go but I promise man I'll make it up
you know it's okay man I know it's not
your fault I'm sorry you guys
choose your own adventure with the
defined nos from fractal design the case
offers custom water cooling options full
size hardware support and top-class
cable management and a compact design
click the link in the description for
more info this has been narrated for u
by RC brain for fractal design for
fractal dist what's up gas so a few
weeks back I asked you instagramers out
there what you'd like to see done with
AMD's new flagship Kaveri APU the a 1078
90 K as it turns out most of you were
actually more interested in the new
wraith cooler that comes bundled with
the chip seems these days the apu has
become the last kid to get picked in gym
class which i think qualifies it to be
my spirit animal but I totally get it
for years we've been stuck with the same
AMD stock coolers that run hotter than a
kidney garage sale with an acoustic
profile that could rival a buzz saw so
it's really no surprise that folks are
anxious to see what the new rave cooler
brings to the table I should mention
that since it is a stock cooler you'll
only be able to find it bundled with the
78 90 K and the FX 83 74 now
so taking a closer look the first thing
I noticed about the cooler is that it's
huge
AMD hasn't compensated this much since
the r9 295x2 and granted size doesn't
always reflect performance if you know
what I'm saying but I can't deny that
seeing a big piece of hardware in my
hands just makes me want to mount it
this is also the sexiest stock cooler
I've seen to date the matte black fan
shroud sports a modern design and
there's even a white LED on the side
that's more unexpected than your oculus
rift arriving on time the unit features
a new 92 millimeter fan a record high
for stock coolers and what's this a
sleeved 3 pin cable what better way to
mask the ketchup and mustard filth that
lurks beneath the unit also features a
fairly dense heatsink and for copper
heat pipes to pull heat away from the
wide copper base plate offering a
cooling capacity up to 125 watt tvp's
you get the same retention mounting
mechanism as seen on past AMD stock
coolers which will either be met with
praise or pitchforks depending on who
you ask
being the stud I am mounting only took a
few seconds and wasn't so much a problem
as the Wraith coolers RAM clearance upon
installation I was shocked to sit back
and realize that the cooler was feeling
at my memory and what was clearly a
non-consensual act usually I like to
watch but the force was just a little
bit too aggressive for my taste here so
I removed the stick to avoid
chill damage the incident took place on
a gigabyte f2 a 88 X and Wi-Fi
motherboard of the Mini ITX variety a
form factor that's likely more prone for
such violations to occur and while
low-profile dims could have avoided the
issue it's still strange to see a stock
cooler that's not 100% compatible with
other parts it's like having a pair of
one-size-fits-all shoes but no feet
actually it's nothing like that I'm
pretty impressed with the rave cooler at
this point but like all hardware
performance reigns above all else so I
fired up all three of our stock coolers
here to see how well they can handle our
95 watt TDP 7890 K when gaming our APU
shot up to an alarming 101 degrees
Celsius with our basic bitch cooler and
97 degrees Celsius on the old but
slightly beefier unit how the system
didn't auto shutdown or blow up in my
face I'm still not sure the Wraiths
cooler maxed out at 83 degrees Celsius
which limits your Headroom for
overclocking but it's still
significantly cooler than its potato
predecessors of course even the
chilliest of temps are unwelcome if
they're burdened with teenage girl grade
noise levels so let's listen in to the
load acoustics of our coolers from
loudest to quietest on our test bed with
a gtx 960 running GTA 5
surprisingly the smallest cooler was an
atrocious sounding though still quite
audible over the sound of our power
supply and graphics card the larger
stock cooler on the other hand was so
loud I'd rather live by an airport
surrounded by train tracks than use it
regularly proving the Wraiths cooler to
have the quietest profile of the three
by a sizable margin despite the minor
clearance issues with small form-factor
motherboards the Wraith keeps its
promise of a cooler quieter solution to
AMD system builders and score some style
points for having a premium aftermarket
appearance for the first time in a long
time the bar has been raised for what a
stock cooler should be an Intel could
take a page out of their competitors
book on making a stock cooler that
offers more than just the bare minimum
but that is all for now guys let me know
