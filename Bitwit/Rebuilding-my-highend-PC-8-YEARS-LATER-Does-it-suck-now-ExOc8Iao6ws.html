I thought it would be fun to take a trip
down memory lane memory and rebuild the
very first PC that I ever put together
in 2011 October 20th 2011 I posted this
picture on facebook of my brand new PC
and a couple years later I disassembled
it and built a new computer and the rest
is kind of history but it's crazy how
long ago this was I built this a year
before I ever started this YouTube
channel just goes to show what a long
time it's been now back then this was a
killer system this was considered a high
end gaming PC it cost me about I'd say
fourteen to fifteen hundred dollars if I
remember correctly so about what a
high-end gaming rig would cost these
days as well but let's see what you get
for fifteen hundred bucks back in old
2011 so for starters my CPU was the
Intel Core i7 2670 I per threading
technology giving us a total of eight
threads for badass parallel computing
we'll see how it performs here in 2019
though after we assemble the rig we're
gonna try to boot it and see how she
games with modern triple-a titles we've
also got our motherboard Asus p8z 68 V
Pro this is a full ATX board it's got
high-end features like built-in USB 3 a
cutting-edge digi+ vrm and surface
mounted power and reset very fancy
features for the time for memory we have
an 8 gigabyte kit that's 2 by 4 gig
sticks of Corsair Vengeance memory ddr3
at 1600 speed these modules were the
bee's knees back in their time they had
a very nice striking aesthetic we also
have an asus direct cu2 GTX 670 ok this
was a high end GPU back in its day of
course the X 70 SKUs were a very nice
sweet spot price to performance wise
even back then as they are now the GPU
is made on the 28 nanometer Kepler
architecture and you can see from the
cooler we've got a nice heat pipe and
fin stack design dual fins to help
dissipate the heat and a relatively open
shroud that ejects heat from all sides
the i/o is also very telling to the era
of this card you've got two dual link
DVI ports and one
GMI and one displayport cooling our 2600
K is not the original hyper 212 but a
hyper 212 Evo because I don't actually
have the original hyper 212 Plus on hand
but this is very close there are
definitely more robust options for
cooling something like fancy core i7
back in the day but it was definitely a
good starter CPU cooler for me and being
able to save some money on the cooler
allowed me to spread it out into other
areas that I deemed more important at
the time for storage we have a one
terabyte WD blue which is not the
original Drive I used for my first
system it was a one terabyte Seagate
Barracuda but I suppose this is fairly
comparable and our boot drive was the
one and only crucial m4 this particular
variant was the 64 gigabyte model that I
probably paid well over 150 or 200 bucks
for I can't really remember exactly but
64 gig SSD I was I felt very privileged
and honored to have one of these to be
booting off of one of these in 2011 a
couple months down the road I eventually
got a second one of these and put him in
raid zero for a whopping 128 gigs which
I still continued to boot off of shortly
before learning that that's a terrible
idea
powering the system is the HX 750 watt
unit from Corsair it's a very quiet unit
semi modular design and 80-plus Silver
certification you don't see silver too
often these days it's either bronze or
gold or you know platinum for the really
high-end extreme ones but a little fun
fact about the HX 750 when 80-plus
initially tested it they returned a gold
certification rating of 90% efficiency
but it was so close to meeting the bare
minimum spec for that that Corsair
decided to just dump it down to an 80
plus Silver certification in order to
protect the customer good guy Corsair
and then finally last but certainly not
least we have our chassis which is the
corsair carbide series no graphite
series 600 T in white when I first saw
this case back in 2011 I absolutely knew
it was the case for me no other chassis
on the market held a flame held a candle
what's the thing it doesn't matter no
case in my mind came close to the looks
of this case obviously a lot of other
cases were competitive functionally wise
airflow wise but this thing really
ticked all the boxes for me
we've got an acrylic side panel window
notice that it's a very small window
doesn't take up nearly the entire side
of the case and we have tons of airflow
pumping through this thing with dual 200
millimeter fans one at the front and one
at the top the side panel also features
two lists removable with these handy
tabs it's got an integrated fan
controller with a nice little dial at
the front panel as well as USB 3.0 and
firewire ports on the front panel
innovation at its finest
so that ladies and gentlemen is the
lineup a part where we're dealing with
from my very first PC from 2011 that
we're building today here in 2019 and
you know since I'll be building I'm
actually gonna have wifey sauce join me
in just a bit so she can help film some
b-roll
I may even force her to do some mounting
too but on that note let's just cram all
this Hardware together and see if this
old Kitty can still perk
the first step here is installing the
CPU order of operations hasn't really
changed neither has the socketing
mechanism for mainstream Intel desktop
CPUs bada-bing bada-boom there it is of
course this is on LGA 1155 as opposed to
the current generation of Intel Core
CPUs which is rockin LGA 1151 next we
can do the mammaries so we've got the
same latches here not much has changed
here either
ddr3 I actually like ddr3 installation
better because the notch is more more
visibly to one side or the other eighty
r4 is still offset but it's it looks a
little closer to the center so I often
get confused with ddr4 I haven't broken
any modules yeah knock on wood but ddr3
has always been a bit more distinct with
its notch which I do appreciate boom and
boom of course we still have the offset
slots too and for the majority of boards
even back then had you install the
memory sticks in a to four slot position
if you were only installing two modules
so there it is memory is all clear to go
Alice knew the city of Cola CPU coolers
were just as much of a pain in the ass
to install back then as they
now just pesky backplate up you know
what they actually give you a tool for
idiots like me try to do it by hand that
tools are amazing can we got the
backplate on and now we can go with some
thermal paste actually I don't have any
thermal paste give me a second all right
it's about to get pasty in here just a
pea so we'll drop this all you need boom
perfect you don't need 30 gallons of
thermal paste like some people not gonna
say any names Geronimo all right that
feels good feels like we've made contact
what which bin oh yeah just a flesh
wound I'm sure it won't affect things
too much well you know what they say
life is like an old heat sink you never
know if the fins are gonna be bent I'm
pretty sure that's a Forrest Gump quote
drop the fan on here actually let me
take this stick out it's kind of in the
way and this guy still goes into our CPU
fan header like so alright our z68
platform is coming together and we are
ready for case installation or
motherboard installation in the case the
case can't really install the case all
right we're gonna start off with our i/o
shield that goes in very easy and of
course loose we've still got like our
middle standoff here that's a little bit
raised for easier installation that was
still a thing in 2011 believe these use
the coarse thread screws uh-huh all
right we got the motherboard installed
no problem next we're gonna mount the
power supply fan face down because we do
have a dust filter for it and notice no
power supply shroud no basement
whatsoever and this is again a premium
mid tower case power supply shrouds were
just not really a thing you actually had
to route them to some degree behind the
motherboard tray or elsewhere and at
least for me I think modular power
supplies were more desirable back then
because of power supply basements it's
not really too difficult to hide a bunch
of cables you aren't using if you've got
that shroud alright so just gonna route
these cables through this large grommet
by the power supply very good cable
management in the 600 team
should have enough length to come out
the other end oh that's tight okay here
it is oh look at that glorious ketchup
and mustard oh how I haven't missed you
next up I'm going to install our SSD and
mechanical hard drive and we have no
shortage of options here we have four or
five of the quarter inch bays which I
guess won't help us that much but then
we also have six drive trays that
accommodate either a three and a half
inch row two and a half inch drives and
this is a lot more drive storage than
you typically see on modern-day cases
now our chassis is like the fractal
designed to find our six that focus on
ample drive storage but a lot of
modern-day cases even the high end don't
really have as many drive options
particularly for five and quarter-inch
drives because opt optical media has
sort of gone the way of the dinosaur it
has been for many years now but even for
three and a half inch drives most of
those have gone either behind the
motherboard tray or underneath the power
supply shroud where there's limited
space as a focus over the years has
shifted more towards a i/os and
radiators and water cooling case
manufacturers are keeping the front of
their cases pretty much clean and open
for radiator mounting and enlarged
airflow now it's kind of interesting
that the mounting holes for this SSD are
on the sticker side which you would
think would be on the other side but I
guess it just goes to show that SSDs
weren't really meant to be put on
display back then I mean they obviously
didn't have like RGB LEDs like they do
now which is potentially a terrible idea
on its own that's a discussion for
another time but it's kind of
interesting to see that there was really
no thought given to how an SSD was gonna
look or how it was gonna be mounted in
your case from an aesthetic perspective
I mean there are pretty much treated
like mechanical hard drives back then
not the sexy superstars that they are
today all right there's one gotta love
the tools design of these 600 T Drive
trays and it just pops in little pegs on
the side getting their Drive installed
just got a wire muff front panel
connectors coming in hot this is also
pretty much the same as it is now we've
got power and reset hard drive LED power
led of course these options are gonna be
determined by your particular case
if you look up here we've got our
internal 20-pin USB 3.0 header which is
a fantastic feature to have on an Intel
motherboard in 2011 all we need to do is
connect the front panel connector from
our case whoa whoa what's going on here
that's not a 25th connector that is a
USB 3.0 type-a plug and the reason for
that is because motherboards back then
when this case came out very few
motherboards actually had an internal 20
pin header for USB 3 so case
manufacturers just put a type-a plug and
figure that people could use it as a
pass-through basically run it to the
back of their case plug it into one of
their USB 3 ports at the rear of their
case and utilize the front panel USB 3.0
that way I think in the past what I did
was I actually had USB 3.0 adapter with
a female type-a plug on one end and a 20
pin header on the other and I think I
stashed it under under one of these
drive cages or something like that but
for now I guess we'll just route this as
a crappy pass through well pop this out
right through there and we'll plug it
into the back oh it doesn't reach it's
not long enough okay let's see if we can
reroute this so that it actually reaches
all right let's see if it reaches now
and it looks like it's just barely gonna
make it boom so essentially we've just
sacrificed one of our two USB 3.0 ports
just so we can have one at the front I
feel like we're blazing through this
because we're already on GPU
installation which is our last component
of the build and GPU installation hasn't
really changed we've got your expansion
slot covers that you got to remove and
you've still got your full-size PCI
Express slots but the same locking
mechanism now there it is oh you know
what this just reminds me I just
remembered that this GPU has a wicked
sag at least it did back then I'm sure
it's gotten even worse now I guess we'll
see once we put the system upright make
sure these are tight I'm not sure how
much that's gonna help with the sag
through to the other side so our GTX 670
has two 6-pin power plugs no problemo
for our 750 watt unit you just see how
how loose the graphics card is oh my
goodness oh my girl she's flexible boys
and you go so quick look behind the
motherboard tray you can see that it's
pretty familiar actually we've got
rubber grommets and large CPU cooler cut
out these are all things that were
pretty standard on
high-end chassis back then you also have
tie-down points for cable management you
can see I'm using one right here
last thing to note is that I didn't
really show it but I've connected all
the fans we've got those two 200
millimeter fans as well as a 120 at the
rear this is actually not the stock fan
it's an Arctic cooling that I installed
maybe a year or so after I built the
system initially that's aftermarket but
we're pretty much done so let's go ahead
and fire it up and see what she's made
of
not much has changed about PC building
in general you could probably follow a
tutorial from five six maybe even seven
years ago on how to build a PC and be 90
percent totally clear there's maybe a
couple differences here and there for
the most part it's remained largely
unchanged honestly I think the two
biggest changes between this generation
of PC building versus now is one RGB and
it's really refreshing I gotta say to
not see an ounce of unicorn vomit upon
first boot and this build actually
helped me realize that one of the things
I missed most about the pre RGB era was
that manufacturers often made their
parts distinct colors for example we
have a light blue motherboard with very
defined light blue heat sinks and we
have that same treatment of blue on our
memory modules which pairs beautifully
with the motherboard without the help or
reliance of any LEDs and it was really
nice back then when you actually had a
selection of different coloured
components as opposed to all of them
being black or gray or silver some color
neutral tone with just a bunch of LEDs
crammed into it because at the end of
the day I think there's a certain
aesthetic that colored paint gives off
that LEDs just can't emulate and vice
versa right LEDs have their own appeal
but I do miss the days of old when the
components themselves were a bit more
colorful and I think the second major
change here is performance I mean just
seeing those results in Doom it was
surprisingly lackluster yeah I think it
just goes to show that we've really come
a long way in just seven or eight years
it's easy to forget that because you
have these incremental improvements
generation over generation but when you
take a step back and look at that string
of improvements over a longer period of
time you really get a sense for how much
faster the hardware has become and
obviously games are looking crispier
than ever and are more demanding to run
than they ever have been so obviously
the hardware needs to scale in order to
meet those needs that was it that's
that's it this is my first PC my first
PC build again so guys thank you very
