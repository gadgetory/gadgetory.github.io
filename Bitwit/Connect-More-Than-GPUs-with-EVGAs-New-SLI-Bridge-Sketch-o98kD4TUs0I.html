for your tech YouTube channel blog or
whatever the dot tech squad is offering
$5 dot tech domains until April 8th with
the code
awesomesauce this is a new initiative so
many domain names haven't been taken yet
that's why I was able to score
awesomesauce Tech before any of you guys
could snag it first and try selling it
to me later
trolls go check it out I put a link in
the description ok bye
what's up guys today's video comes as a
quick high-level discussion of some
heavy new information that's just now
coming to light and the implications of
this news are sure to take many of you
by surprise since its arrival to the
mainstream market the EVGA sli bridge
has been dismissed as nothing more than
an overpriced vanity piece for
compensating system builders but plans
for a reengineered version of the bridge
will add support for a groundbreaking
technology that will redefine everything
we know about nvidia sli credible
sources have confirmed that beyond the
linking of multiple GPUs for increased
processing power now for the first time
ever the EVGA sli bridge will possess
the remarkable ability to connect and
harness the full power of human
testicles now initially this may sound
like pure fabrication but for the last
decade or so big tech companies have
been developing a technology that
bridges the gap between a pair of
healthy beanbags in order to effectively
split testosterone bound workloads much
to their credit the ancient stones have
helped put life on this earth since the
dawn of man but for as long as they've
been hanging around the family jewels
have largely remained an untapped source
of power until now in hopes of appealing
to a global market the great minds
behind this technology are using the
existing acronym to define a completely
new set of parameters sack linking
interface acts as a high-speed bus
between your chicken nuggets that scales
the effects of manhood to potentially
hazardous but unparalleled levels
according to science the plumbs of life
have always worked in perfect unison
during reproduction but new research
shows that functionality outside of the
bedroom is a money bag tag team effort
utilizing only half a pairs testosterone
supply at a given time for generations
this constraint has made manly endeavors
like heavy lifting cooking steak and a
- flirtation difficult tasks for the
average male gamer however once SLI
enables your knackers to pool their
hormonal resources these activities
become second nature by allowing your
sweet acorn milk to reach its full
potential with minimal side effects need
a task done that requires additional
sauce three-way and four-way SLI lets
you and a friend link up for
uncompromised virility this testicular
joining takes advantage of a new
processing method known as split game
rendering written entirely in bro code
SGR aims to increase the performance of
wingman operations by evoking a
desirable onset of aggression and
tenacity sources are calling this
technology a breakthrough success as
only one beta tester has been violently
pepper-sprayed to death so far
engineering reps say this is just the
tip of the iceberg as they continue
testing additional features up until
launch at an undisclosed date no word
yet on pricing but officials say based
on what consumers are paying for EVGA
standard us-ally bridge no dollar amount
can shock us now there's still much we
don't know about this drawer dropping
technology but being the first of its
kind is sure to bear some low-hanging
fruit so expect consumers to have their
wallets and coin purses ready as always
thank you guys for watching toss me a
like on this video if you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
