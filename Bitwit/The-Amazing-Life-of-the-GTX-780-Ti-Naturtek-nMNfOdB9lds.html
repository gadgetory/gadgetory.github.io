that you're here welcome to nature Tech
today we examine a rare specimen of
graphics card from the shores of the
Silicon Valley a descendant of the
Nvidia family and a Geforce to be
reckoned with this is the GTX 780 Ti in
its natural habitat
a warm chassis the card appears to be a
tranquil subject but in reality it is a
natural-born killer all the way down to
its crew decor alongside the 780ti is a
most staggering paradox with a top speed
of 928 megahertz the card can run
without moving scientists have deduced
however that the creatures innate
versatility stems from its vsync
capabilities which are remarkably
adaptive despite having only one eye the
green King is also an established hunter
from the Redlands a weaker AMD card
approaches some Collard a contender but
the 780 Ti calls it lunch preying on AMD
cards is typically a stressful task for
the 780 Ti during this arduous process
it sips power and blows hot air out it's
asked to remain calm a spectacular
phenomenon surrounding this natural
survivor is its predisposition for
interspecies breeding during mating
season it seeks out a suitable
motherboard and attempts to mount her
slot if she is willing and the fit is
right the ritual is intense but
short-lived the motherboard refers to
the cards brief performance as PCI
Express this has been an inside look at
the gtx 780 Ti join us next time when we
explore the fascinating species
comprised solely of females the
motherboard thank you and good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
