what YP sauce made for me
like a couple weeks ago pretty sweet
right I'm really even sure what it is
but it's sort of an abstract thing
paying homage to my channel she's
eventually gonna remove this little
piece of paper it's just a placeholder
she's gonna put like a nice bit wit logo
decal right there maybe we'll hang it in
the new office it's actually pretty
large here's my hand for scale although
you guys don't really know how big my
hand is so wine glass for scale paper
towel for scale penny porcelain Bert for
scale Kent for scale now you get the
idea but anyway today is gonna be very
special because are you seriously I'm
missing parts you gotta be over here
somewhere oh thank god oh thank god
you're here don't ever leave me again
but as I was saying today is gonna be
super special because my good friend
Franklin Josh who a lot of you already
know as the beloved ginger and vice
president of marketing for fractal
design North America has actually rented
his craziest rental vehicle ever from
the folks over at Van Dutch it's a it's
a $700,000 yacht and we're gonna be
cruising on it today wifey's sauce are
you coming alright let me film your
reaction really quick let me get them
she's naked okay so I'm gonna live out
one of my wildest fantasies and do the
one thing that I've always wanted to do
on a luxury yacht build a freakin PC to
be specific a thread Ripper high-end
gaming system it's gonna be pretty sweet
and additionally fractal josh has
challenged me to a speed build so from
the time it takes us to leave the
Newport Beach Harbor to the time we
arrive at Catalina about 45 minutes
later I have about that window to build
a high-end gaming system he's like
they'd be building along with me he's
probably just gonna be cruising chillin
up on top of the deck drinking champagne
being an asshole
so it's gonna be really interesting I'm
pretty sure I can do it but the fact
that we're on a yacht it's moving it
might be choppy choppy waters and stuff
like that I might need a phone in a
little bit out hey yeah Austin I know
it's you I'm calling you from my Austin
Evans emergency hotline phone okay look
I think I might have bit off more than I
can chew and I really need your help
you ready for this what I get seasick
take a seat band oh boy so are you
excited I'm super excited we're gonna
build this thing I think it's possible
because we have about 45 minutes to an
hour to get to Catalina I've done build
in less time but now it's gonna be
pretty choppy it's fairly windy it is
gonna be choppy however we do have two
of us and I feel like built is generally
what else you're gonna always have to
hold the system so this go flying I also
assume like screws and any has small
stuff is gonna just go flying
immediately I did buy two screwdrivers
on the way over here but I don't know if
they're magnetic tips our failure
success hinges on whether or not I
bought screwdrivers with magnetic tips
that's right now it's not a lot more
than that okay maybe you have more
things are gonna go wrong I have to
reanalyze a lot of things all right Josh
so let's be realistic how long do you
think it will take Austin and I to build
a system on this boat how long oh I
think you have like what they like be
five over thirty minutes so it
cuz otherwise by lunch damn it is it
okay fine but let me start it now but
we're talking so but in Austin and I do
build it within the alot of time then
you're buying lunch correct I will buy
lunch for myself if you guys and it
better and it better not be McDonald's
you cheap-ass bastard you can have
whatever hors d'oeuvres you they
advertised to make some credits and
laughter's your word literally means
nothing to Mason it's go time it's
pretty much go time all right do it
we're good we got cooler power supply
rising thread Ripper cpu GTX 280 I hate
your Strix got a zenith extreme next 300
motherboard for ACS and 32 gigs of tread
NCR GB ddr4 300 and a 1 terabyte OCC Rd
400 D where the hell's the case where
the hell is the case dude are you guys
serious are you guys serious right now
dude we need this keeps cool alright
alright okay this is this is going to
spill if I don't do it now
oh my god see the cows playing in the
first place
wait watch behind girls motherboard
rides on all right I'm gonna put this
underneath this although my billet
oh my god oh my god I'm having an
out-of-body experience right now we got
it together
we got this oh my god okay CQ is out
dude how am I gonna get this like
actually super then I have a screwdriver
screwdriver somewhere Oh My Jesus put
the front panel
okay oh no we just have a new dollar
yeah
dude I know they're not going faster do
not go any faster
once groups one screw at a time guy is
leaving right now are you serious yeah
okay hold on hold are you can you any
these screws here take these screws give
me that all right take doc take this
yeah okay who's the hardest build ever
here we go can we just do two screws
that's gonna be fine it other way I'm
just gonna try not to stab you with
don't move my finger love it
all right all right that's good that's
good all right cables through meet it
KUSI's try to thumb screw it in tiny
their own screws and be a power supply
in we're gonna be okay we're gonna see
pu so we're going to undo this open
three two one so that yeah one of us
holding everything right now that is
exactly how it should be that's the only
way this is gonna work
all right all right get rid of that see
be careful be careful
penalty's that this beetle take an hour
and a half are you serious about this
you got 10 minutes of this speed no
minutes no that's bull so I knew that I
knew that this needs to go
yeah rails puts into place down like so
down with that and we're doing close one
two three
this might be the only time that this
actual socket makes sense when you're
putting it together our boat we have a
10-minute sort of time penalty at this
speed we gotta get as much in as
possible once they speed up we can't do
any I know I understand
okay you handle one bank will handle the
other make sure that it's yeah yeah it
dripping with sweat into the motherboard
right now my god it's just so difficult
yeah yeah we each get aside with my
right down there yeah another one ready
yeah down we cannot lose our heads here
we can we can I think you know also
why'd you have to get such sharp Ram
stop enjoying mother nature without us
yeah ideas fruits for the SSD so you're
gonna have to undo that where we guess
with these screws so we're definitely um
I in your mouth okay got it
you've got the cooler don't those 12
screws Austin we will make you throw
them up which shouldn't be too difficult
full of buoyancy oh my god we have tree
of life several phases here to bring
some so stream a thing was maybe a
little messy we can deal with messy just
has to be functional I'm slowly bleeding
on this mother
by the way SSN let me get this on before
they decide again okay that's in we're
good mounting fans to the radiator of
course
Josh would pick the 360 rad wait wait
it's a 360 yep so we have three fans to
master on here three minutes three
minutes until we die until until it's
full force again yeah okay I need Josh
all right Newton that I don't like you
very much yes
especially now hey why aren't your
coolers easier to work oh yeah right you
need to mount the CPU cooler to the
actual board oh okay for real do not
speed up right now we will die weird
because a CPU will die more importantly
so we're actually going to need the
adapter bracket which is right
why is it coming out here so it looks
like boom boom alright so you get to
those two look at these two okay okay
I'm trying to be helpful here so I mean
you still got like go minute 53 so I
just gotta take two hours a bucket I've
seen videos you build pcs before right
I've never been filled with so much
murderous rage in my life
how many stand up to like realistically
need we only need like four or it's good
39 more to do the choppy install you
starting to catch up with me wait I
don't think you have the stand-ups in
right stand up climbing right no you
can't find the middle one wait it's not
is this motherboard not gonna fit
nothing is lighting up at all right now
hold on Holly wait let's double check
this uncheck this might be a form factor
issue Josh there's a message if I see
natively fit dat exports are you serious
right now we take we take this thing in
right now do ya yeah let's just take
let's take a paper
I didn't say okay what if we did because
we don't have any tools like modify
anything unless we could you know what
we could maybe push it flat enough you
can maybe push it flat enough like we
could damage the case push it flat
enough so that we forced mounted they
can that could work it could work
because we don't need these rubber
grommets hold on there's hardly any
metal here it's just do it let's just do
it let's destroy the case destroy it
destroy it
okay now go ahead and try them out
good this actually might not be crazy
I'm getting legitimately sick right now
me too this is not fun we're trying to
creatively modify the case right now I
just said sit at another bar yeah we're
smashing down the boat out part of the
case where the where the rubber grommets
are to the right of the board so that we
can get it flush to actually fit eh dude
you've bent the whole thing in look this
whole thing is sloping down right now
hold on where's the tape this is all the
tape we have hold on we're gonna be able
to make this work Oh oh that's close the
work we're on the middle standoff oh
we're you get down screwdriver where are
the screws so we creatively modified
your case there are some design
deficiencies so through sheer force we
bent the metal onto our well going it's
not gone so it's either what if you
reviewed this piece before I have not no
actually I have not reviewed this case
Josh I did a live build it was not a
full review so I do not take blame for
anything that's going wrong right now
and I hate you
all right panel now
I'll try to hold it can you actually see
where she'll line up cuz I can I see
yeah yeah I was shining up for neither
dude I'm just beyond my wildest
expectations
in a bad way aren't you dizzy right now
oh my god this is this is like threading
a needle right no tiny bit higher oh all
right there distorted yes okay
we just do one more screw on the
opposite end yeah we're good oh we use
the graphics card and the wires all the
wiring oh my god we can do it we're
almost there on a CX 24 pin so I'll
catch this through for you oh it doesn't
the motherboard is covering live the
grommet area the cable routing holes so
we actually don't have anywhere to route
this unless we rather go through the
bottom the bottom bottom bottom yeah go
see this through yeah okay gonna get the
floor get get the floor alright can you
get the a pin and make so you got this
man if he's like three minutes plug into
each things every time I get lined up
you know bounce and I completely lose
the line get in
that's it video first off straight way
actually gonna do this like is this
actually a thing they were about to do
right now actually gonna happen
great alright
oh my god I'm gonna do what this isn't
gonna fit it all pile you know what mess
I don't do I'm just gonna remove one of
these fans yeah the middle fan amazing
idea maybe it's best to be doing on your
site
yeah do these things that you gonna work
I feel like we've like dropped it so
many times like it's not flying no you
know what computer parts are
surprisingly resilient I think this is
actually gonna do just fine it's not
gonna be the breeze to look at but it
will work
mark my words okay three minutes
deadlock before we do a hard turn three
minutes hard turn really hard turn all
right we got this dude what is hard turn
names
okay it looks good in the back oh it's I
need to tell oh dude slight tilt it
slightly tilted the motherboard on it
straight is that why I think so that's
right not quite holy there we go I think
there we go
it's it's it let's get yeah put the
screwdriver inside of the screw first is
it night Minich
I know but but you'll have to guide it
in with your hands okay once all we need
one all we need like the motto of this
build
yep we've got one more fun
on the graphics card is that shit okay
do we have the system right now yeah and
then we just need the thumbscrews
we go honey for the thumbscrews
I don't know oh wait there's my pocket
maybe
system completes suck it all right so
we've got the finished build here a
passionate hashtag finished build potent
quotes I have a finish built with
fractal Josh of course to tell us
exactly how we did look at this what are
your initial thoughts I mean look look
at what we managed to accomplish and we
had some major handicaps right yep so
now it is the graphics card not fit with
the radiator but the motherboard is too
big for the case we did on-the-fly
modifications yeah make sure that we can
make this bill which I appreciate chose
the components for the building I've
been because I knew deep down that I
could make it work that we could make it
we need the extra challenge because we
were so talented in PC building so what
is an unfair had chosen like really
compatible components with that in mind
I mean you guys did put the PC together
yep you installed the Celsius s 36 yeah
more or less it's Iligan s 30 30 what's
the purpose of the fan that just appears
to be laying on top of that version so
this was actually one of the included
120 millimeter GP 12 we had to uninstall
that and because we were crunched for
time and all of the up-and-down
movements we decided to just end it here
this is flexible right it's not even
mounted so you can really position it
however you want you tailor it to the to
whatever hotspots existing in your case
it's actually a very innovative idea
that you guys should have honestly
thought of okay we can have this so free
that working so well I know I'm in
Berkeley thank you so the other thing is
that you guys managed to build this and
what 30 knots you see the way let me let
me sleeve it if you go to a certain
speed if you go serve distance
tiny dick you slow down that speed that
time expense now google it there might
be original that doesn't sound very
scientific about it but she's not Thomas
size that the boat was slowed down
repeatedly to allow extra time for I
wouldn't say an aptitude perhaps earnest
we finish this in 51 minutes yeah yes
and we would have gotten Catalina in 46
persons wait all right you know what I
think I think we can settle this right
here why don't we like just press what
are we trying to turn the system on
if LEDs come on after you sum this you
could do all that and still not post
correct this is true maybe much which
made me calls for a follow-up part 2
video how about this as is you try and
powered on right now and then if it
powers on you do a follow-up video where
you benchmarking this like that sounds
fair we have we have found common ground
to serve lupus lizard Allah fists
alright you have a screwdriver by the
way how did you not okay because you're
gonna short the front now sore so last
week oh alright I got the parts plan are
we ready
flip it on all right here we go oh I see
it oh oh I mean okay oh well you know I
got Ram we've got Ram we've got CPU
we've got motherboards LEDs one fan is
spinning
fans are totally optional so what do we
consider this do we cuz there's a half
boot then no I think there's no better
TV so you bother to plug them all in the
mountain for the purpose of the house
yeah aesthetics are very important but I
mean for the most part it seems like we
can actually go about testing this I
feel like this is a postable system that
even if the case alright here's the
thing do you want to do the follow-up
with the case fans not spinning since
they're not spinning now I will see how
would do it as you built as we built it
okay building all right so with no case
as it cooks itself and has heat stroke
halfway through Unigine alright I want
to see that to be fair as we built it
although means that we are not including
any sort of overclocking involved yeah
right yes it's as we go I know that even
under that a clocking involved right
yeah so yeah well that's just something
that we'll have to follow up with in a
future video coming soon staking to be
continued TBC it all just fell out don't
say that on camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
