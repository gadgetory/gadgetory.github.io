what's up guys today I'm taking a look
at the enthu evolve from fantex if
you've been following this year's
Computex coverage you might have caught
wind of their ATX version of this case
which just hit stores earlier this month
but the one I have here with me today is
the original micro ATX model that's been
out for quite some time now now that
being said this is the first product
from fantex I've actually reviewed on
the channel so I'm quite excited to
finally see what all the hype
surrounding their end through line of
chassis x' is all about so digging right
in the exterior of the case incorporates
a sleek modern design comprised of four
aluminum panels that converge
beautifully at the front with their cool
subtle curves the case comes in your
choice of white black or silver and can
be picked up for about 130 USD it's
definitely not the cheapest micro ATX
case we've seen but I can already tell
from the outstanding build quality of
the side panels that there's more to
this case that makes it worth the
premium price tag the panels do veer
towards the glossy side but minimal
reflectivity and fingerprint visibility
at least on the white model make the
evolves contemporary aesthetic easy on
the eyes and if I'm speaking personally
one of the best-looking micro ATX
chassis is currently available
fortunately this case isn't just about
good looks as we get our first sign of
fan Texas ingenuity with their fully
toolless panel design all four panels
simply pop on and off with the help of
several small latches however both side
panels remain partially attached
allowing them to swing open gracefully
to completely remove either panel simply
lift up off of its two sturdy metal
hinges and voila there's also foam
padding along both sides of the frame to
prevent any accidental scuffs taking off
the front panel reveals a large
removable dust filter with an optional
plastic piece for additional airflow and
the single 200 millimeter intake fan can
be replaced for a dual 120 or single 140
radiator for front side water cooling
when popped back into place the front
panel also leaves Justin
of gap around its edges to facilitate
healthy airflow near the bottom is a
white LED strip to indicate power status
and fantex has even included three
additional LEDs in red blue or green
which can easily be swapped out to
complement the color scheme of your rig
while we're on the topic of accessories
here's a quick look at the cases
mounting screws which come packaged in
this beautiful hardshell toolbox
competing case vendors still using
plastic bags for their accessories
declined to comment on the fancy
packaging because they were out getting
food stamps lining the sides of the top
panel are stylish ly thin ventilation
slots which would cause concern for
insufficient exhaust if it weren't for
the wide opening in the rear oddly
enough we don't get the same ventilation
at the front which would have definitely
helped the hot air escape that much
quicker under the hood we get adjustable
mounting points for 240 or 280
millimeter radiators making this case
out to be an excellent choice for
compact custom water cooling also this
probably goes without saying but never
use the top panel of the case as a
carrying handle unless of course it's
the only thing you plan on bringing an
attractive window on the left side panel
sports a tall and narrow profile which
lets you appreciate the prettier
components of your finished build though
you'll probably want a few LEDs inside
of the case to see clearly through the
heavy tent our front i/o is found on the
right side of the case with power and
reset up top and USB 3 plus mic and
headphone jacks below while I appreciate
that the ports are fixed to the actual
case for cleaner panel removal the fact
that a computer usually sits to the left
or right of a person technically makes
these right sided ports and
inconvenience for 50% of the population
naturally whoever plans to set this case
on their right hand side better get used
to the old reach around on the back we
see yet another example of the cases
creativity with a single five and a
quarter inch drive bay clearly fantex
prioritizes the front of the case for
cooling so perhaps this clever yet
awkward cage placement would be better
utilized for something like a reservoir
than an actual optical drive for exhaust
you get more adjustable mounting strips
for a pre-installed 140 millimeter fan
or a 120 millimeter replacement and just
beneath our 4 wide expansion slots for a
range of PCI configurations finally at
the bottom you get a removable dust
filter for your power supply which also
means raised elevation for fresh air
intake cracking this baby open we get
at the micro ATX motherboard tray
surrounded by quality rubber grommets in
all the right places and there's even
cutouts at the bottom of the board for
tidally routing your front panel
connectors a compact yet spacious
interior supports full-length graphics
cards up to 318 millimeters long and CPU
cooler towers 192 millimeters tall near
the front of the case a flat mounting
wall can be used to house either one
three and a half inch drive two two and
a half inch drives or a tube reservoir
for custom water cooling while the
flexibility here is appreciated the
panel is held in place by four Phillips
head screws and I would have liked to
keep the tooless theme going for easier
installation you also might have noticed
that the lower area of the case is
separated from the main interior by a
shroud that spans the entire length of
the case like the rest of the frame the
shroud is made of steel and features
ventilation holes so that the lower GPU
in your to a configuration isn't starved
for airflow while there's a fan Tech's
badge facing the side panel window
beside it is a smartly placed cutout
that reveals the side of your power
supply while covering up any cable mess
at the front end at the front of the
case you'll find a hidden drive cage
that holds two two and a half or two
three and a half inch drives which can
be accessed from behind the motherboard
tray the two plastic caddies feature
rubber grommets for reduced vibration
and toolless mounting brackets for
quicker installation of three and a half
inch drives if you don't mind parting
with the additional storage the drive
cage can actually be removed to fit
power supplies longer than 180
millimeters with the drive cage gone you
also have your pick of installing a
water cooling pump with the included
pump bracket or mounting that 240
millimeter radiator when removing the
shroud cover with its two thumb screws
another smart move by fantex that offers
a wide range of possibilities for custom
water cooling now behind the motherboard
tray just beneath the large CPU cooler
cutout is a metal plate for a single two
and a half inch drive that can be
mounted in one of two positions surely
having only one drive here leaves more
room for cable management but I still
would have liked to see a second
mounting plate particularly for water
cooling enthusiasts who have just traded
in their other storage options in the
case for a tube reservoir and pump
whether your motherboard is limited on
fan headers or you're trying to
consolidate your cables a SATA powered
pwm fan hub supports up to six fans
which can be then controlled via your
motherboard during your build cable
management should prove to be
hassle-free with
an inch of space behind the motherboard
tray and handy velcro straps to keep
wires in order additional tie-down
points would have been a plus but one
could argue that the smaller form factor
makes this less of an issue as my first
fantex case review comes to a close the
Evolve has left me with a great first
impression of the enthu line and a
yearning to work with more of its
innovative offerings the case is
full-sized hardware support albeit the
motherboard and extensive flexibility
for custom water cooling definitely
caters to the enthusiast crowd where
forfeiting the option of having options
is not an option
granted it's not perfect and there are a
handful of minor issues that would need
to be addressed for a 2.0 version though
where the case falls short it more than
redeems itself by getting so many things
right in both form and function but let
me know you guys think of this case in
the comments below and don't forget to
