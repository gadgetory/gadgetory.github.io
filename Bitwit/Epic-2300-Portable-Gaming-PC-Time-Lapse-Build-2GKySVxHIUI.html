awesomesauce news today I will be
building an epic portable gaming rig and
if you're wondering why I'm doing this
well the simple answer is just because I
can and because I want to yes that's
right I had a few parts lying around and
I figured I might as well build
something out of it so without any
further explanation let's go into the
hardware that I'm using I got a 16 gig
kit from a data this is their ddr3 2800
speed memory that's 2 8 gig sticks very
fast memory for my drive I'll be using
an m5 pro xstream 256 gig SSD from
Plextor the case that this is all going
in as a fractal design node 304 it's a
mini ITX chassis I've got a 4770k
processor it's unlocked we can do some
overclocking later top-of-the-line cream
of the crop has well core cpu intel core
CPU resonator 3 max cooler from Zalman I
haven't heard too much about this cooler
but hopefully it'll serve me well it'll
go nicely in this note 304 since it
supports 120 millimeter rads so we'll do
some water cooling there Maximus 6
impact motherboard this is asus is first
rog board and mini ITX form factor so
I'm really excited to use this should be
a really cool looking inside of this
chassis and second to last we've got a
high current pro 850 watt power supply
from antic this is totally overkill for
this build but like I always say better
to go overkill than underkill so we'll
see how this power supply works out for
me and last but not least the Beast of
this build is the GTX 780 Ti g-force
card from Nvidia so when that said why
don't we get on to a little time-lapse
build
stop so write it out here is where I
realized that this power supply isn't
going to fit inside this case and even
if I were able to mount the unit to the
mounting bracket there still wouldn't be
enough clearance for the gtx 780 Ti the
power supply is simply too long
luckily I had a high current Pro 650
watt nearby which is not only short
enough to fit in this case but it's also
got just the right amount of power
delivery for the system the sacrifice
here is that the unit is non modular so
I had to work a bit harder to manage the
unused cables but as you'll see I didn't
have too much trouble so with that said
on with the build
all right and that pretty much wraps up
the build it's done woohoo and I'm
really happy with the way it turned out
I like the lighting
I think the lighting looks cool even
though all the colors are mixed matched
I think it kind of just gives a nice
little aesthetic even though the when
the enclosures on you can't see the
lights anyway I think it looks pretty
wicked when the enclosures off the
non-modular cables weren't too much of a
hassle I just kind of bundled them up
and shoved them into one corner next to
the video card and that front fan I kind
of scooted it off to the the side a
little bit so that there's still some
nice airflow coming from that fan so
it's not completely blocked off but once
again it's just one of those limitations
that you have to deal with with a non
modular power supply especially when
you're working in a smaller mini ITX
chassis like the note 304 but other than
that I'm really satisfied with how it
turned out I still need to install an
operating system on it and maybe I'll do
some tests maybe I'll even do a
follow-up video with some gaming
benchmarks and you know other things
like temps and acoustics for example but
let me know what you guys think and if
you'd like to see that future video let
me know in the comments below and also
let me know what you think of this rig
if you think it's awesome sauce or weak
sauce so just leave a comment based on
how you feel I'm curious to know also
like or dislike the video accordingly
and be sure to subscribe to awesome
sauce news for more tech videos thanks
for watching guys I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
