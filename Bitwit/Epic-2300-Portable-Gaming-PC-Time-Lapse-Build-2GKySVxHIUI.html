awesomesauce news today I will be
building an epic portable gaming rig and
if you're wondering why I'm doing this
well the simple answer is just because I
can and because I want to yes that's
right I had a few parts lying around and
I figured I might as well build
something out of it so without any
further explanation let's go into the
hardware that I'm using I got a 16 gig
kit from a data this is their ddr3 2800
speed memory that's 2 8 gig Stix very
fast memory for my drive I'll be using
an m5 pro xstream 256 gig SSD from
Plextor the case that this is all going
in as a fractal design node 304 to Mini
ITX chassis I've got a 4770k processor
it's unlocked we do some overclocking
later top-of-the-line cream-of-the-crop
has well core cpu intel core cpu
resonator 3 max cooler from Zalman I
haven't heard too much about this cooler
but hopefully it'll serve me well it'll
go nicely in this note 304 since it
supports 120 millimeter rads so we'll do
some water cooling there Maximus 6
impact motherboard this is a Seuss's 1st
ROG board and Mini ITX form factor so
I'm really excited to use this should be
a really cool looking inside of this
chassis and the second to last we've got
a high current pro 850 watt power supply
from antic this is totally overkill for
this build but like I always say better
to go overkill than underkill so we'll
see how this power supply works out for
me and last but not least the Beast of
this build is the GTX 780 Ti g-force
card from Nvidia so with that said why
don't we get on to a little time-lapse
build
you
you
stop so write it out here is where I
realize that this power supply isn't
going to fit inside this case and even
if I were able to mount the unit to the
mounting bracket there still wouldn't be
enough clearance for the gtx 780 Ti the
power supply is simply too long luckily
I had a high current Pro 650 watt nearby
which is not only short enough to fit in
this case but it's also got just the
right amount of power delivery for the
system the sacrifice here is that the
unit is non modular so I had to work a
bit harder to manage the unused cables
but as you'll see I didn't have too much
trouble so with that said on with the
build
all right and that pretty much wraps up
the build it's done woohoo and I'm
really happy with the way it turned out
I like the lighting
I think the lighting looks cool even
though all the colors are mixed matched
I think it kind of just gives a nice
little aesthetic even though the when
the enclosure is on you can't see the
lights anyway I think it looks pretty
wicked when the enclosures off the
non-modular cables weren't too much of a
hassle I just kind of bundled them up
and shove them into one corner next to
the video card and that front fan I kind
of scooted it off to the side a little
bit so that there's still some nice air
flow coming from that fan so it's not
completely blocked off but once again
it's just one of those limitations that
you have to deal with with a non modular
power supply especially when you're
working in a smaller mini ITX chassis
like the note 304 but other than that
I'm really satisfied with how it turned
out I still need to install an operating
system on it and maybe I'll do some
tests maybe I'll even do a follow-up
video with some gaming benchmarks and
you know other things like temps and
acoustics for example but let me know
what you guys think and if you'd like to
see that future video let me know in the
comments below and also let me know what
you think of this rig if you think it's
awesome sauce or weak sauce so just
leave a comment based on how you feel
I'm curious to know also like or dislike
the video accordingly and be sure to
subscribe to awesome sauce news for more
tech videos thanks for watching guys
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
