video suggests today I'm gonna be
showing you some gaming benchmarks of
Crysis 3 it's currently in open beta at
least during the time to filming this
video it's multiplayer and I've been
playing it a lot lately because I've
been benchmarking but I've actually been
liking it a lot as well it looks amazing
and it's actually really fun I found
myself playing it more than actually
benchmarking I kind of got carried away
but today I'm gonna be showing you eight
different video cards and how they
perform with this game so I've got four
Nvidia and four AMD cards and and I'm
gonna pit them against each other to see
which one performs the best but first
let's take a look at the hardware that I
was using so I'm using a core i7 2640
400 megahertz and keep in mind guys that
Crysis 3 does utilize a lot of your CPUs
processing power which is why I was
actually seeing temps in the high 80s at
times I'm also running on the z68
chipset with an Asus board I've got 16
gigs of Vengeance Ram clocked at 1600
mega transfers per second you can take a
look at the other specs right there and
I did want to point out that I am on
Windows 7 64 bit and I am using the
latest AMD and NVIDIA drivers and lastly
all of these tests were run at 1920 by
1080 on a 27-inch Asus vg2 seven eight
alright so starting off with the big
dawgs we've got EVGA GTX 680 up against
H is 79 70 X this is the gigahertz
Edition so it comes to factory overclock
out of the box and I was able to get max
settings on both of these cards as you
can see the framerate is marginal I mean
just by 2 frames the 680 beat out in the
7970 just barely as far as the temps go
obviously it's gonna vary a lot from
manufacturer to manufacturer so we did
see a better cooler more efficient
cooler on HIAS card but yeah as you can
see they're very high settings
completely maxed out as you can see I'm
using SM AAA it's a bit more it's
actually much more efficient method of
rendering than MSAA
this was actually able to achieve higher
framerate with that setting on moving on
we've got the GTX 670 this is my
personal card as most of you know by
asus up against another H is card the
7950 and here we saw we're able to
achieve maximum settings on both cards
once again and as you can see the frame
rates are just
basically exactly the same so there was
very little difference other than the
aftermarket cooler of course but you can
see there it's it's pretty much
negligible at this point that brings us
to PNY gtx 660ti that was up against the
Sapphire Radeon HD 7870 and here we can
see that we actually had to change some
of the settings we are no longer
operating at maximum settings with a
7870 I had to turn down the SMA a to 2x
while the gtx 660ti was actually able to
achieve cold Mac settings while still
getting average FPS of 35 and last but
not least actually last and least was an
MSI GTX 650 Ti versus the H is 7850 and
here we can see we definitely bump down
the settings the 650 TI didn't perform
all that great I thought it was actually
going to outdo the 7850 for whatever
reason but I actually had to turn down
all the video settings to high including
the texture resolution and also the SMA
and anisotropy was bumped down to 2x as
far as the 7850 goes as you can see
there I was still operating at very high
so almost Mac settings but I definitely
had turned on the SMA a2 2x as well and
that wraps it up for this video
hopefully next time somebody asks you
can my video card run Crysis you can
tell them yes it can or no it cannot you
need a better video card because you
suck that's gonna do it for now guys
thank you all for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
