video suggests today I'm going to be
showing you some gaming benchmarks of
Crysis 3 it's currently in open beta at
least during the time to filming this
video its multiplayer and I've been
playing it a lot lately because i've
been benchmarking but I've actually been
liking it a lot as well it looks amazing
and it's actually really fun I found
myself playing it more than actually
benchmarking I kind of got carried away
but today I'm going to be showing you
eight different video cards and how they
perform with this game so I've got for
NVIDIA and for AMD cards and and I'm
gonna pit them against each other to see
which one performs the best but first
let's take a look at the hardware that i
was using so i'm using a core i7 2600
candidate for t 400 megahertz and keep
in mind guys that Crysis 3 does utilize
a lot of your cpu's processing power
which is why i was actually seeing temps
in the high 80s at times i'm also
running on the z68 chipset with an asus
board I've got 16 gigs of vengeance RAM
clocked at 1600 mega transfers per
second you can take a look at the other
specs right there and I did want to
point out that i am on windows 7 64 bit
and i am using the latest AMD and nvidia
drivers and lastly all of these tests
were run at 1920 x 1080 on a 27 inch AC
SVG to 78 alright so starting off with
the big dogs we've got EVGA GTX 680 up
against hias 7970 X this is a gigahertz
edition so it comes factory overclocked
out of the box and I was able to get max
settings on both of these cards as you
can see the frame rate is marginal I
mean just by two frames the 680 beat out
the 7970 just barely as far as the temps
go obviously it's going to vary a lot
from manufacturer to manufacturer so we
did see a better cooler more efficient
cooler on H is card but yeah as you can
see they're very high settings
completely maxed out as you can see I'm
using smaa it's a bit more it's actually
much more efficient method of rendering
than MSAA so was actually able to
achieve higher frame rate with that
setting on moving on we've got the gtx
670 this my personal card as most of you
know by a sous up against another H is
card the 7950 and here we saw we're able
to achieve maximum settings on both
cards once again and as you can see the
frame rates are just basically exactly
the same
so there was very little difference of
than the aftermarket cooler of course
but you can see there it's pretty much
negligible at this point that brings us
to PNY gtx 660ti that was up against the
Sapphire Radeon HD 7870 and here we can
see that we actually had to change some
of the settings we are no longer
operating at maximum settings with a
7870 I had to turn down the SMA a 2 2 x
while the gtx 660ti was actually able to
achieve whole max settings I while still
getting average FPS of 35 and last but
not least actually last and least was an
msi gtx 650ti versus the H is 7850 and
here we can see we definitely bumped
down the settings the 650 TI didn't
perform all that great I thought it was
actually going to outdo the 7850 for
whatever reason but I actually had to
turn down all the video settings too
high including the texture resolution
and also the SMA a and anisotropy was
bumped down to 2x as far as the 7850
goes as you can see there I was still
operating it very high so almost max
settings but I definitely had turned on
the SMA a to 2x as well and our episode
of this video hopefully next time
somebody asks you can my video card run
crysis you can tell them yes it can or
no it cannot you need a better video
card because you suck that's gonna do it
for now guys thank you all for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
