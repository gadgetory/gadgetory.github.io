my team and I have finished designing a
revolutionary product that will change
the face of the PC industry and the
future of our company for you have my
attention Chad then it is with great
pleasure and excitement sir
that I present to you crystal RGB the
world's first ever tempered glass with
integrated RGB lighting this monolith of
innovation combines the latest trends in
PC gaming to deliver a product every
gamer wants crystal RGB let's light up
some crystal
uh first off awful tagline awful I agree
so so I'm confused I it doesn't actually
do anything incredible isn't it the
research shows that gamers these days
value form over function which is why we
have removed all the features except the
ones that look good the fact that this
product comes via already is just a
bonus what are you some kind of idiot
how can it how can a piece of glass PV
already what does that even mean we
don't know sir but with the arrival of
VR headsets products using this badge
have seen a phenomenal spike in sales
whether they offer real benefits to a VR
experience or not it's the same reason
that this product will also be shipping
4k ready with an 80 plus titanium
certification unbelievable yes it does
sound too good to be true so but I
assure you this is where the PC gaming
market is headed now while our data
suggests that customers would be willing
to pay top dollar for a product of this
caliber the Crystal RGB will be
competitively priced with an MSRP of
just $9.99 Oh competitively priced who's
gonna pay 10 dollars for that uh no sir
I meant 999 dollars sir uh we figure if
Apple can sell a book for 300 we have a
shot at selling this for a thousand okay
that's enough all right this is a
complete disaster and quite frankly an
embarrassment to the company all right
the only thing that's impressed me here
is that you've somehow managed to use
half of our corporate resources on
what's easily the worst product ever
created okay and that's my ass on the
line Chad all right I I hate to do this
but I'm gonna have to let you go
sir I wasn't expecting you
oh it's okay it's okay I come back for
my coca-cola oh it's a warm now tastes
like a piss hey what's that man
oh that's just Chad's project sir I
don't think you'd be interested in LED
and the tempered grass rooks on a
combination make me want the sexy time
you know uh
be that as it may sir it doesn't
actually serve any functional purpose
huh
no has function no sir
hmm no function no production costs keep
overhead row make profit high huh ah
we need a most strong idea wrecker you
have you take a his job effective
immediately
what thank you sir I wanted his job for
so long you have a big ball and you have
a tiny phone big boy you show me your
product now and you I take my coffee
Breck with two small Robo sugar is that
Reverend to his testicle understood sir
if you'll come over here I can show you
some of the features
tell me mop so you can see we've got
quite a few LED strips going around the
Sun Oh B already that's a genius
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
