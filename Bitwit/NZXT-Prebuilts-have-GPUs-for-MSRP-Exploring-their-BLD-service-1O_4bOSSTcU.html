the channel hope you're all doing well
so a couple weeks back NZXT reached out
to me and they're like hey Kyle we'd
love for you to take a look at our
pre-built service online configurator
thing and I was like whoa did you see
did you say pre-built because that's
that's like a trigger word for me but
NZXT was like please just check out the
website and stuff just take a look and
sounds like fine I'll take a look I'll
take a look so I did and I was
pleasantly surprised by just how
different their approach to pre-built
system building is compared to any other
pre-built solution that I've seen to
date so I figured what the hell I might
as well share the information out and
give it to you guys and lets you do with
it as you will and I'm definitely
looking for feedback on this service I'm
sure NZXT is as well so by the end of
this video please watch the whole video
first before you comment any
constructive criticism or anything like
that I want to hear your honest feedback
on this service in the comments below
because I think NZXT is kind of on to
something here
you guys can let me know if you agree
but here's their website it's called the
service for starters it's called build
or BLD before we actually dive straight
into the configurator I kind of want to
see how NZXT defines their own service
here and so when we go to the what is
BLD or what is build well what is build
page they're pretty upfront I mean right
out the gate they're letting us know
they're super transparent there's a 99
dollar fee attached to this service and
the $99 which isn't too bad actually I
was expecting quite a bit more includes
you know in a nutshell these four sort
of pillars of their service for starters
the configurator lets you select up to
three PC games and as you go about
configuring your system the configurator
will automatically tell you what kind of
frame rates you can expect to see in
each of those games it kind of takes a
lot of the guesswork or all the
guesswork out of determining what kind
of performance can you actually expect
in games X Y or Z so I think this is
actually really cool and especially
since they're really putting their money
where their mouth is by giving a full
money-back guarantee and in case you
were wondering how NZXT is able to give
these performance predictions it's all
based on their cam software and all the
data that that's been acquiring over the
last few years
gives them the ability to give us a very
accurate projection of how any given
system is going to perform also
professionally built yes it goes without
saying that NZXT people probably know
how to build a PC it's gonna be dust
free it's gonna be really tidy it's
gonna look very professionally built
because it's built by a team of trained
peoples and even the operating system
the drivers are all gonna be up to date
pretty much the only thing you have to
do once it arrives on your doorstep is
start using it so a very nice quick and
easy turnkey solution in that regard I
also do appreciate a good all-in-one
warranty when it comes to pre belts this
one's really no different in the fact
that instead of having to deal with
eight or nine or more different vendors
you only have to deal with a single
warranty plan as NZXT is the one
middleman between you and all those
manufacturers in fact they're one of the
manufacturers but they're also sort of
being the the single tech support that
you'll need to call in the event that
anything goes wrong with your system and
I believe it's a two-year two-year
warranty as well NZXT is also promising
a wicked fast turnaround meaning that
your system will actually be shipping
out to you within 48 hours
after you place your order which is
lightning fast so those are sort of the
four pillars if you will of this service
that they are bundling all together for
$99 and what's even better is that as
we're about to see they're charging MSRP
for all the components and that's I
think that's the most exciting part here
stuff even though you're paying a little
bit of a premium here $99 you're
actually gonna be saving quite a bit
when it comes to you know your DRAM and
your GPU especially we're gonna take a
look at that right now in fact let's
let's get started let's actually just
get out some some some system here now
the three games that we're gonna choose
obviously there's a limited list here
just based on sort of popular demand I'm
gonna go pub key for tonight
might as well just make a train here
with battlefield one you can also select
between 1080 and 1440 so I'm gonna go
with 1080 still a very popular
resolution of choice I'm gonna go ahead
and pick my price now these are sort of
just baseline suggestions 750 sort of
like the more budget lower budget you
know 800 and less $800 or less twelve
hundred and fifty is the mainstream sort
of sweet spot
and $2,500 being your your high-end you
know balls-to-the-wall system so I'm
gonna go the mainstream 1250 you'll see
when I select that it asks me what cpu
platform I'd like to go I've been doing
quite a few rising builds lately so
let's switch it up and do some intel now
right off the bat here's the base system
that it spits out and to the left here
you can see our games with their
projected frame rates with 108 fps
guaranteed in battlefield 1 117 and
fortnight 86 and pub G you'll also
notice that these estimates are based on
the 1920 by 1080 P resolution that we
selected just a moment ago and the
game's highest graphics settings so this
is 108 FPS on Ultra settings in
battlefield 1 this is you know max
settings in fortnight max settings or
ultra preset in pub G is what we're
seeing here but moving on over here you
can see that this base system that they
they quoted us here is $1,600 which is
quite a bit more than the twelve hundred
and fifty bucks we initially opted for
but that's okay because from here you
can you can either go lower or higher
and it'll sort of swap around the parts
a little bit until you find that sweet
price point that you're looking for so
maybe 1600 is a little high for us and
right now we have at core i5 7500 with
the gtx 1070 TI and 16 gigs of ram with
an SSD at 275 gigs so I'm gonna go
lower-priced and see what what happens
there so that took off maybe about a
hundred bucks $7,200 we solved the same
case interestingly we have now a 7600 K
and still the same card more or less and
oh I see we've been reduced to eight
gigabytes of ddr4 and SSDs the same
let's let's keep going and you notice
how the the frame rates drop down right
so let's let's go another lower lower
one here now you can see we've dropped
down a little bit further so with this
system floating at around thirteen
hundred and fifty dollars we have a core
i5 7500 gtx 1066 gigabyte and 16 gigs so
we're back in 16 gigs average as five
ddr4 so just for the sake of this video
let's let's just say that this is pretty
close to what we're sort of aiming at
right in terms of performance and price
but you can go a step further and
actually configure these individual
components so we're
click the configure button here and you
can see here we've got every single
category pretty much of our system
starting with the case you can upgrade
your case it starts you at the NZXT s340
if you want an elite an additional 30
bucks which is MSRP they're not they're
not up charging for any of these
components whether it be an NZXT part or
not you're gonna be paying MSRP for all
this stuff which is fantastic so let's
say yeah I want that elite I want that
tempered glass side panel let's move on
to cooling right now they've stuck us
with a cryo rig h7 very respectable
cooler you could go to the h7 Lumi for
an additional 25 bucks or scale up to
one of their kraken liquid Aereo's I'm
cool with the h7 for now on our
motherboard we have an MSI z2 70 a pro
which you know has has some basic
features it's not gonna do crazy amounts
of overclocking but at the same time we
have a 7500 we can't overclock anyway
but if you wanted to no problem twenty
bucks more will get you the 7600 K then
maybe you want to go back to cooling and
say you know what maybe I do want to
crack it I'll add that in there and
obviously the price is gonna go up the
frame rates gonna go up the flexibility
here is is really nice additionally
we've got graphics and again we have a
gtx 1066 you bite model here goes all
the way up to a GTX 1080 Ti you'll
notice that you don't have every single
model of every single component here we
have five options for a GPU and they
kind of each tick a different tier of
performance and price we have three
options for power supplies looks like
they're partnering with EVGA here Ram it
looks like g-scale you get some g.skill
options with the rip just 5 a little bit
more cost effective than the tried NZ
but that is also an option you can scale
all the way up to 32 gigs it looks like
- 16 gigabyte sticks that's obviously
gonna set you back a little bit as RAM
it is not cheap don't need to tell you
guys that and then storage we've got you
know you want to say - based SSD even
got us an nvme option here going all the
way up to one terabyte you can do up to
2 terabytes for that for that SATA base
drive also your mechanical storage goes
anywhere from one terabyte to 4
terabytes on a Seagate Barracuda now
once you've configured all of your core
components then you can get a
little bit more personalized here with
your color scheme so this is obviously
gonna be limited to the color options
for the case for example the s340 elite
only comes in white black black and red
black and blue or you can do hyper beast
for an additional 100 I'm gonna keep it
simple with a nice black and white color
scheme and you even have the option to
add in some cable mod extensions for
your system just to tidy it up a bit
more or to make it look a bit more
presentable in various colors as well
that's an additional cost of course and
then we've got extras extras here NZXT
stuff for the most part you got your
NZXT puck USB 2.0 expansion there is a
gigabyte Wi-Fi bluetooth adapter
you got your grid plus and your hue plus
and rounding out with software they're
gonna be installing Windows 10 home
unless you specify otherwise that you'd
like to upgrade to pro for 30 bucks more
now once you get to this checkout page
you get an itemized list of all the
various components that you just
selected and their relative MSRP s and I
think this is where the service shines
the most is that you are only paying
MSRP for everything meaning that even
your your DRAM or your GPU in particular
are not affected by the inflated mining
prices so if you look here the 1070 ti 8
gigabyte model is an EVGA Super clock
gaming model MSRP s for 580 dollars u.s.
that is the amount that you are going to
pay for that card if you use the LD
service as opposed to buying that same
card ala carte on Amazon which I've
already looked it up retails anywhere
from 1,400 to $1,700 of course you can
try your luck at a different 1070 TI
like this water-cooled one that's only
$900
what a deal so this is one of the few
times guys that I'll actually suggest
going with a pre-built service like this
one over building a system yourself if
you need a gaming PC right now because
it is a terrible time to buy some of
these components ala carte
whereas you can just get it for a really
really good deal not even a good deal
you'll get it for MSRP here which is
just the price it's supposed to be
technically but you won't get robbed of
hundreds of dollars and granted yes you
still have to pay the hundred dollars
than the 99 dollar service fee but that
really pales in comparison to the extra
hundreds of dollars you'd be spending on
a GPU so altogether and I also have to
you know give them a shout-out that's
it's $99 just like they advertised on
their home page there are no little
hidden fees they're not tacking on five
dollars for this BS thing and ten
dollars here I'm not trying to nickel
and dime you it's 99 bucks the rest of
the cost of your system is MSRP so I
really do appreciate the business model
here I think NZXT has done a great job
with the site as well it's a very lovely
site looks nice
super clean easy to navigate and all
that jazz so on that note they actually
had me configure a system myself a week
ago and they shipped to me they shipped
me the system that I configured in stuff
so let's let's take a look I haven't
even opened up the box what's in the box
actually completely forget what I
ordered it wasn't at all what I just did
here on the screen but camera angle
alright guys so here's the system out of
the box just got this little cover on it
here because I wanted to give you guys a
nice big unveiling I haven't even taken
a look under it myself so it'll be a
surprise for me to to some degree um I
actually forgot to film the unboxing
portion I thought I was I went through
the whole I went through all the motions
I was talking and laughing and it was
great
turned out I forgot to record on the
camera I was only recording audio so
just want to let you guys know that it
came very well protected at least at
first glance we'll take a look under the
hood in just a moment but it came with
surrounded by this really tough egg
crate phone which is super high quality
and probably probably does a pretty good
job of absorbing sound so I may actually
use it for the studio here let's go
ahead and take a look under the hood to
see a if our system arrived in one piece
and be how she looks how those
professional NZXT builders did
in their assembly process so there we go
three two one go oh well I guess that's
kind of anticlimactic
well that's good this is a good sign
because it indicates that they have
provided some additional protection
inside of the case as well take that guy
off and we do have some nice packaging
material here and voila
look look get here look at her there hey
now you guys feel free to gawk over this
gaming PC all you want I'm gonna quickly
read off the specs of the system because
quite frankly as I mentioned I kind of
forgot what they were so obviously we
have the s340 in glossy white not the
elite because we've just got a standard
acrylic side panel window here but still
looks very nice
and I like how they kept the the plastic
wrap on there that means I get to do it
myself
Oh
I'm gonna put this away before I damage
it we've also got the Intel Core i5 7600
K you're damn right I got an unlock SKU
and that is being cooled by the cryo rig
h7 the motherboard in there is the MSI Z
270 SLI being paired with eight gigs of
Ripjaws five g.skill memory at twenty
six sixty six megahertz our graphics
card is the MSI GTX 1066 gigabyte gaming
X which retails MSRP for a little over
three hundred bucks I think you can't
find a much cheaper than around five
hundred dollars at the moment on on
various retailer sites so definitely
gotta steal their storage we had the
crucial MX 300 525 gig SSD with a with
no mechanical I think I opted out of a
mechanical drive is that right did I not
get a mechanical yep no hard drive so
this is just an an based system as is
but obviously very easy to just pop in a
mechanical drive should you wish to do
something like that
the total cost for this build including
the $99 service fee was twelve hundred
and eighty for us which isn't bad now
the one cost I have not gone over yet is
shipping cost and that's of course gonna
largely depend on where you live where
you need the system to be shipped to
power this thing on alright system power
on and everything's lighting up looking
good GPU fans are spinning
I should also let you guys take a look
at the cable management I didn't really
get a good look at it myself
looks like they did a pretty good job I
mean utilizing all the tie-down points
with zip ties for your main cables your
ATX is right behind the cable bar where
it should be
they've stashed a lot of stuff down in
the power supply basement that's kind of
part of what it's designed for and it
looks like there's even room to spare if
you wanted to add in additional devices
other little random things there's
there's also plenty of room just behind
the motherboard tray that they've kept
really clean for you those are look at
our power supply very very very plain
and simple I think I just got the
bare-bones sort of EVGA 80 plus bronze
one it wasn't like a supernova or
anything like that but
yeah it looks everything looks pretty
good back here what I'd like to do now
is hook up some peripherals to this guy
boot it up again and jump into one of
the three games that we selected during
our configuration process to see if we
can hit the frame rates that were
advertised to us by NZXT don't get me
wrong I am rooting for the system to to
win and deliver those numbers but if it
doesn't I will be getting my money back
on this system which is zero because I
did not pay for it but I think it'll
still be sort of fun to compare and also
just to validate just how accurate NZXT
T's projections are compared to the real
system when it finally arrives so let's
go ahead and book this sucker up alright
so we've got the system up and running
we're gonna be playing some pub G which
is one of the games that I selected when
configuring the system and I'm gonna
make sure that everything is on Ultra
settings here it's got a full-screen
1920 by 1080 the actual quote that I was
given from NZXT was that I'd be able to
run this game on Ultra settings in 1920
by 1080 at 65 FPS so that's what we're
gonna look for here in the top left
corner of our of our game so we can see
the fraps counter there and let's just
jump in so here we are in the desert map
and we're getting anywhere from you know
65 70 FPS which is exactly where we want
to be this is what NZXT is guaranteed us
and lo and behold they are pretty darn
accurate and obviously 65 FPS here is an
average so occasionally we will see some
dips below that number it's also gives
me a confidence that their numbers are
pretty accurate for the other titles on
their list as well and finally I want to
give you guys a quick look at the
desktop just sort of the preinstalled
applications we've got cam a couple msi
apps like the like drag and I and the
MSI gaming app because we have an MSI
GPU after all GeForce experience and
steam which I think most PC gamers are
gonna want installed anyway
fraps that was my doing this was not
here but overall very light on the
pre-installed software which I do
appreciate
good job NZXT alright y'all so summing
things up here I'm pretty impressed with
just the sort of approach NZXT taken
with this pre-built configurator I think
the whole process from start to finish
definitely feels like it was created by
a group of PC enthusiasts who understand
what PC gamers like you and I are
looking for in a prebuilt
desktop should we decide to go that
round at the same time the whole process
is simple and easy enough for an
inexperienced builder to hop onto the
website and and say hey look I want to
play these games at these frame rates
click click click and automatically have
the perfect so-called perfect PC
configured for them in a matter of
minutes so that's actually really cool
and you know not gonna leave out the
fact that you can still get some
components for MSRP going this route as
well which is insanely valuable I'm a
fan of BLD I think that's probably one
of the best ways to go about buying a
prebuilt
if you are gonna go that way looking
forward to hearing your thoughts as well
feel free to let me know honestly honest
opinions on BLD thank you guys so much
for watching be sure to toss a like on
the video if you enjoyed it and feel
free to subscribe to the channel for
more tech stuff coming at you really
soon you can also check me out on
floatplane if you want to watch my
videos a week early without ads all like
the link to that in the description
