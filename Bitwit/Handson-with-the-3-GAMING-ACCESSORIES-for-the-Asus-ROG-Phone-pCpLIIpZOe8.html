brought to you by fantex berta gear
enter max be quiet and cable Mott you
can learn more about their products and
the links below what's going on guys
calif it would here at Computex 2018 and
i'm checking out the new asus rog phone
which admittedly we're kind of late to
the party here there's already been a
ton of content on this phone already
sure you guys have seen a lot of it but
we're gonna do a little bit of
exploration with the accessories that
are sold separately with this particular
phone because it's obviously first and
foremost a gaming phone and mobile
gaming can be kind of limited when you
don't have the proper peripherals or
control ability that's not a word the
proper control with certain functions so
we're gonna explore the actual
accessories around the phone and just
talk about the experience overall so
let's take a look first off we've got
the game vice as you can see here kind
of has these two controllers on either
side it's actually a single unit though
it connects to the phone via type C so
yes the ROG phone does connect via
type-c connector and it's got the sort
of ribbon cable connecting the two ends
together you get four bumpers two on
either side two joysticks for your
thumbs port four buttons on the right
and a d-pad with you know start and
select and things like that let's just
go ahead and dive into this racing game
now the screen right off the bat it's
kind of hard to tell from the camera but
it is pretty damn gorgeous it's 2160 by
1080 I believe very high resolution 90
Hertz refresh rate as I'm sure you guys
are already aware one millisecond
response time and the color is just
super vivid here very sharp crystal
clear image and I'm gonna suck really
bad at this game but moreso talking
about the experience of me sucking it's
kind of nice playing a racing mobile
game with this accessory because you
don't necessarily have to turn the phone
left and right you can kind of just use
the joysticks to control the car
it won't make you a better gamer though
that's for sure now I will admit the
accessory feels a little bit loose on
the phone it kind of like moves around a
little bit it doesn't feel that as
secure as it possibly could so hopefully
they fix that I did hear that this is
pretty close to a final version of what
it's going to look like in stores but I
mean I just hope it hugs the phone a
little bit better than what I'm feeling
right now the joystick is pretty
responsive it's kind of hard to tell
with whether it's just my skill level or
the actual accessory but everything
seems to respond very quickly super
snappy speaking of snappy there's a
Snapdragon processor in here the phone's
also configurable up to five hundred and
gigs of storage so plenty of room for
all the games and then some oh and I got
rekt the buttons on the right side are
actually pretty tactile they felt they
feel good and they're fairly large maybe
a little too large but definitely not
having a hard time locating them at all
and they seem to be placed pretty nicely
for my size hands the bumpers feel
pretty good they're a little bit
plasticky for my taste as are the
buttons on the right for that matter
I feel like higher quality construction
could have been used and I'm not sure
exactly how durable these will be over
time especially if you're using this
everyday or just about everyday but yeah
I guess it also depends on how much
these accessories are really going to
cost obviously the phone is not going to
be cheap I'm hoping that these
accessories for at least what I'm
feeling right now are a bit more
reasonable
let's move on to the next accessory
though so this is the mobile desktop
dock you can see we've actually got the
ROG phone mounted onto a dock right now
with just which has full size HDMI it's
got things like USB type-c there's
actually maybe four three or four USB
ports there as well
which allows us to interface with a
keyboard mouse and up to a 4k monitor
and look at that that's pretty awesome
where we're playing some sort of mobile
pub G game right now from the looks of
it I'm parachuting down don't mind the
mouse cursor right here this black
cursor that's just you know everything's
still in development right now obviously
with some software iterations they're
gonna be removing stuff like that but
right now I'm actually moving my
character around with full-size desktop
peripherals seems pretty smooth very
responsive certain buttons right now
certain keys are not working because you
actually have to map various keys to the
touch functionality of the phone and
then once you do that you can actually
save the profile so that you can just
easily swap between them on the fly
depending on the title that you want to
play but again this is still very much
in development very cool though I should
also mention the dock has an Ethernet
jack for one gigabit per second
wired Gigabit LAN so yeah you can
actually play online I believe we're
playing with other people online right
now so that's kind of cool
just to get you one step closer to that
full rich desktop experience obviously
still not exactly the same thing now
I've heard that the speakers on the ROG
phone are actually pretty decent but you
don't actually have to rely on those if
you're playing a game in this way there
is an SPDIF out to your 5.1 channel
surround sound system or headphones if
you so desire so you don't have to skimp
on audio either
and the last accessory we're taking a
look at here is the twin view dock now I
don't know why the screen just went
black oh because we're loading into the
game perfect well this is actually a
pretty cool accessory it allows you to
sort of dock the phone into this upper
area and there's also a built-in monitor
so it's a six inch AMOLED Full HD
display so you can have dual screens
here this is gonna be great for things
like streaming you want to stream on
Twitch from your mobile device you can
do that and still have you know chat and
whatnot in the top screen you can even
take a look at your system thermals
there's a fan speed adjustment there's a
built-in fan apparently right behind the
phone itself is that's that's what's
doing all the work right now but it's
actually a pretty cool little setup um
there's a six thousand milliamp battery
that's built into the back of this thing
there's bumpers on either side that
actually feel much higher quality than
the first accessory we take a look at in
addition you get advanced dual haptic
feedback so you get the the edge that
you need for total domination as the
spec sheet says I'm wondering if you
could actually extend the game screen
onto the top screen here that way you
could maybe have like a map of the area
so they don't have to keep toggling back
and forth that would be pretty sweet I'm
pretty sure you can but I don't know
exactly how to do that because it's very
crowded at the Asus booth right now the
horror G booth we don't really have a
dedicated rep to show us how everything
works so we're kind of flying by the
seat of our pants right now that's
obviously too loud to test anything out
right now but this twin view dock also
have some front-facing quad speakers
just to give you a more amplified sound
over what the ROG phone could provide
natively that's pretty cool
so that was my little hands-on
experience with the various accessories
that you can buy for the ROG phone which
I'd be very curious to check out later
on this year when it finally launches
you guys let me know which one of those
accessories tickles your fancy the most
if any I personally like the team view
dock that was the one that felt and
functioned it's the best in my opinion
but well off the comments guys thank you
so much for watching this video go ahead
and toss the like on it and get
subscribe so you don't miss any more of
my coverage here at Computex 2018 I'll
see you guys in the next one
