awesomesauce news today I'll be doing a
bit of a DIY project on my personal
build I'm gonna explain to you that just
a bit but first off I just want to
address the microphone that I'm holding
here my lavalier mic isn't really
working very properly so I'm forced to
use the built-in mic on this thing so
excuse me if I look a bit awkward
holding this in my hand but the built-in
mic on this thing is actually pretty
good so hopefully the audio is treating
you very well on your end so first off
for those of you who might not be aware
or if you guys just need a reminder this
is a 600 T case it's got a 2600 K
overclocked at 40 400 megahertz 16 gigs
of RAM Asus GTX 670 as well as a PhD 68
v pro motherboard a bunch of other stuff
a lot of SSDs vertex force and things of
that nature so it's it's a bit dated
it's three years old it's actually the
first system that I built so I'm very
proud of it and it's definitely um
sentimental to me in some ways because
it's my first rig but it still performs
just fine I edit on it nearly every week
and there's no lag there's no slowing
down the rendering times are still
pretty decent so it's not quite time to
do away with it yet or sell it for parts
or something like that but I do want to
make some changes to it some slight
upgrades and modifications my phone's
ringing hold on one second so the first
thing I'm going to be doing to this
system is I'm going to be reinstalling
the drive cages that I had initially
taken out and the reason for that is I
want to move the SSDs in the mechanical
hard drive that's in there currently in
these five and a quarter inch bays into
these drive cages and the reason why I
want to do that is because I want to
have room in my five and a quarter inch
base for this fan controller the reason
why I'm installing a fan controller is
because the fan controller on the 600 t
blew out a couple months ago I was
playing a game and all of a sudden my
rig was way too quiet I'm like ah my
rigs really quiet in fact it's too quiet
and sure enough the fans none of the
fans were spinning and the system
actually shut off like five seconds
later so I checked it out and yep sure
enough the fan controller is completely
blown out so I'm going to be installing
this this lambtron FC v v2 controller I
actually did a video on this as well if
you want to check that out so the other
thing I'm gonna be doing is gonna be
taking this water 2.0 this thermaltake
water 2.0 liquid cooler and I'm gonna be
swapping that out with the H 100 that's
currently in there this is the original
H 100 and it still performs quite well I
think the LED the LED on the water block
actually went out as well so there's
no lightning from there but it's not
really a performance issue at all but I
just have this thermal take cooler lying
around collecting dust in my room so I
figured I would put it to good use and I
say the last thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna reinstall these extension cables
these are BitFenix alchemy cables in
white and I originally had them in my
rig but have since then taken them out
because I was doing more testing in here
and I needed a variety of cables to plug
in multiple graphics cards and things of
that sort so I'm gonna be reinstalling
those just for a nice clean aesthetic
look oh and I will be installing the
white LED that I picked up in in Taiwan
recently if you want to check out my
vlog video if you haven't already I'm
gonna be installing an LED and hopefully
everything will just run a lot smoother
and this thing will be a bit cleaner as
well speaking of cleaning I am going to
dust this thing off right now before I
actually get building or rebuilding in
this system because it's it's it's quite
dusty and I'm not really comfortable to
admit when the last time I cleaned it
was so on that note let's let's get
started I'm gonna go clean this thing
and then we're gonna do a time-lapse
it's gonna be awesome
go
all right guys it is finally completes
that whole process took me roughly four
and a half hours so it's a bit more
involved than just building a computer
from the ground up because I had to
relocate all the drives which meant
unplugging everything I just unplugged
everything because the cable management
on this thing was just god-awful so I
even forgot to mention that at the
beginning of the video that one of the
major changes of this little updates was
gonna be the cable management and I'm
much happier with how everything turned
out these are all the old parts as you
can probably tell I've got a lot of
dusts at once again I'm pretty ashamed
of myself that I let it go this long
without ever cleaning it so I have the H
100 here this is a the drive cage
adapter that allowed me to install those
SSDs and that mechanical hard drive and
the five and a quarter inch base it's a
Xigmatek five and a quarter inch to
three and a half inch converter and then
from there I used these three and a half
inch to two and a half inch adapters for
those SSDs so there was a lot of
adaptation going on in this case these
are the Cougar vortex fans that I was I
was using with the H 100 because the
stock fans that came with it were a
little bit noisy so I swapped those out
as well for the Thermaltake 2.0 fans and
I'm really happy with how the led I'm
sorry the fan controller looks in this
case at first I wasn't really sure
because the front of the 600 t is all
mesh and the FC v is very sleek looking
so I thought those two looks would clash
but actually I really like how it looks
you guys can let me know what you think
personally and I I currently have all
the fans hooked up to it so I have full
control over the cooling of my system
and one really cool thing is that I
actually hooked up the led to the fan
controller so I can turn the led
completely off so if I want to leave the
system running when I'm asleep but I
don't want the light to to bother me
then I can just completely turn it off
or I can just dim it a little bit so I'm
really excited that that worked out as
well the way I went about connecting the
led to the fan controller was I
completely snipped off the end of the
power adapter that came with the LED so
now that gives me these two leads that I
can then route to the to the fan
controller and I did that via a molex to
three pin adapter which I just picked up
for a couple bucks on frozen CPU
basically I just took the two leads
wired them to the molex taped it up and
then
from there I just plugged in the other
end that 3-pin connection to the fan
controller and presto so all around
really solid build really solved an
upgrade I should say let me know what
you guys think in the comments below of
this this little renovation and if you
just simply like this video I am
planning a another build kind of like a
main rig this is probably gonna be my
secondary rig I do have a 49 30 K just
lying around and I've got an X 79 board
as well that I'm planning on doing a
build on soon the reason why I'm waiting
on it is because I'm waiting for another
case to come out that hasn't released
yet it's a the 780 T from Corsair you
guys may have seen it from our Computex
coverage or from anybody else's Computex
coverage for that matter it's a really
cool looking case I'm a huge fan of
Corsair cases so hopefully I can get a
sample of that and do a personal build
with that X 79 platform so look forward
to that
thank you guys so much for watching this
video subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already don't forget to toss me
you like and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
