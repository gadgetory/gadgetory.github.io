channel today we are taking a look at
Corsairs brand new Vengeance RGB mammary
kit mammary not these mammaries this
mammary so we're going to be taking a
look at this we're going to be doing a
quick demo this is a very short video
because there's really not too much to
talk about here it's pretty basic
straightforward information but this is
essentially a sort of a follow up to the
existing line of vengeance LED memory
and if you guys are familiar with those
kits they look pretty much identical
except for the lighting bar is actually
capable of doing more effects in
different colors which is pretty cool
you can actually configure all the LEDs
within the course air link for software
this is version 4.6
you can also configure these LEDs and
other third-party applications such as
RGB fusion from gigabyte I think that's
the only one that's supported right now
don't quote me on that but I think I
read the reviewers guide that's at least
one of the few that's supported right
now with this kit and they're going to
be adding more support for various other
third-party applications in the near
future my kit in particular that we're
looking at today is a 32 gig kit this is
one of two that is available at the time
of launch if you're watching this video
on the day of upload the 4 by 8 gigabyte
kit so 32 gigs in total ddr4 of course
at 3,000 megahertz and in the near
future Corsair will be rolling out
additional kits in various capacities
speeds and configurations so that's
really nice you're going to get a
variety of elements to choose from as
far as platform support goes these
modules play nicely with z170 Z 270 and
X 99 that's all on the Intel side
obviously and even though we don't quite
have Rison support just yet Corsair has
assured us that AMD is latest platform
will get support for these modules in
the very near future you could say that
it is just on the horizon let me go
shoot myself now taking a closer look at
the modules themselves these have a very
similar appearance to the existing
Vengeance LED line which i think is a
fantastic thing so you still get that
anodized black aluminum heat spreader as
well as a reversible little piece on the
front with the corsair of the perforated
corsair logo which also does light up by
the way which is super nice and i also
like how minimal it is they're not
trying to cram their branding down your
throat with like a giant Corsair you
know like lettering and stuff like that
so that's also cool the lighting bar of
course is the main feature here with the
RGB lighting effect
support it you've also got an LED
controller and the appropriate circuitry
built into the PCB this is of course
there's in-house design and they
guaranteed that there's not going to be
any performance droop Ã¤j--
with all these RGB supported elements on
under the PCB so you're still getting a
lot of bling however not at the expense
of any sort of performance degradation
so there's it's really a no compromise
solution which is also appreciated so
when that now let's dive into the
software here and I would say out of all
the things at this launch at the time of
launch the biggest downfall to buying
this kit right now is the software the
hardware looks great the LEDs are some
of the best implementation I've seen on
DRAM to date and honestly there's like
no hot spots it looks really great
the hardware is great but the software
could use a bit of work especially in
just a lag Department like when I first
fired up this program all these system
vitals that are here now it took about
two minutes for them to display I
actually reinstalled the program twice
because I thought it was a serious issue
it's just slow it just took two minutes
for the stuff to show up so that was
kind of a bummer there's also some other
things that we're going to talk about
later about the software but for now we
can see that there's our four modules
here which are strangely called LED
number one LED number two and so forth I
would prefer like module one or stick
one LED LED makes me think that they're
talking about individual LEDs on a
single module so it's a little bit
confusing at least for me but
fortunately if you click on one of them
you can rename it to anything you like
so let's just do stick one all right
that's going to represent obviously the
far left module and you can see here you
can apply for different effects static
is very self-explanatory so we'll do
that one first you can have a here's the
color wheel or the color square you can
choose it works very nicely
I like how to give you a before and
after so you can see what you're
switching to even if you want to just
kind of iterate your color slightly kind
of know what you're coming from so
bloody bloody bloody have also got
sliders here all right that works very
smoothly and let's see you can do
grouped or ungroup ungroup obviously
means independent effects that only
affects that module you're working with
and if you go grouped you can obviously
sync it to all the modules or you can
select if you want to do like a
staggered effect every other module you
could do that whatever you check will be
applied so let's go ahead and click
apply and we'll wait for this
sex to take place now this is one of the
other issues with the software that I
was talking about it takes a long time
for the LED effect to apply you can see
we're still in the rainbow wave and we
should be static green at this point so
I don't know if you've been counting the
seconds but oh wait is it doing stuff
okay I think it just switched now so
that was probably 15 seconds or so to
apply that effect it's very slow it's
incredibly slow especially if you're if
you know exactly what you want it's not
a huge deal but if you're experimenting
like I am right now and going back and
forth and doing a lot of just sort of
options and you're dialing a bunch of
different effects in a short period of
time it does it is a pain it is a huge
pain so hopefully they patch that up
soon but that's static okay not much
else to see there let's go ahead and
switch over to color pulse this
obviously is exactly what it sounds like
you've got seven different colors to
pulse between you can now change that up
if you want to do three one two seven is
it's pretty much your range here and you
can customize that as well so if you
have two colors let's say you want to do
I don't know like a police police color
effect like sirens like be wheelie all
right you've got red and blue right
there and then you can do seven if you
want
switch it up taste the rainbow and all
that crap and then you've got group
delay group delays essentially
representing how long the current color
will be displayed for before the next
color comes in before it follows it and
so I'll just do this with the demo so
right now let's do an apply so you can
just see color pulse will do do it at
the fastest speed will sync all of them
as well which they are and we'll do
fastest speed so you can kind of see
what it does there's pulsing effect
obviously doesn't you have to go that
seizure if you don't want to you can
slow it down but just to quickly give
you guys a look what that looks like
again the colors are very rich and
bright vibrant they're very vibrant you
can quote me on that so they look really
nice but there is color pulse you can do
group delay I'll show you a group delay
looks like now so we'll do a medium
group delay there we go so there's
there's group delay so you can see it
sort of changes the effect it kind of
creates a little bit more an illusion of
movement across the modules with the
LEDs themselves so yeah I mean what else
soil see on your site let's just do the
next one here color shift color shift
let's just apply you can see here
there's our color shifting effect and
with group delay enabled so I'm going to
actually change the group delay to none
because it does look quite different to
that way hey that looks a lot different
so you can see group delay definitely
changes the overall cosmetic of the
effect and that looks looks pretty
wicked
that's super fast let's just slow it
down just a tad let's just slow it down
boom see actually the the speed slider
is very sensitive
I barely turned it down it looks like I
only turned it down I don't know 15 10%
on the slider but it looks much slower
the effect is taking place a lot slower
more gradual than the slider at being at
a hundred so it is quite sensitive and
that's pretty much it do we already do
rainbow rainbow oh oh yeah forgot you
can also do if you do a group delay you
can also make the effect go forwards or
backwards you know laterally across the
modules and yeah let's do rainbow my
rainbow is the last one this might have
been the effect that was at the
beginning of the video so maybe I don't
need to show you too much but we'll do
none speed will speed it up and we'll
sink it thank you there you have it if
you guys are curious about to see what
it looks like with like individual
sticks and not all synced we can maybe
do that so let's just see how crazy we
can get here we'll do stick one rainbow
superfast
boom okay apply that led to this is the
second stick we're going to do color
pulse super fast between seven colors no
we'll do we'll do it between two colors
and we'll do our little police effect
there ungrouped apply that LED three LED
three we'll just do a static boring with
the boring color teal teal boring so
boring teal no actually I love you I
love your okay and then last one we'll
do color do we ready to color pulse no
we'll be good go to color shift color
shift we'll do five LEDs there cares
slow that down like lot apply and there
you go we've got four sticks all doing
different things simultaneously
which would probably not match with
anything but still pretty cool that you
can do it so I think that pretty much
wraps it up for the video guys overall a
very solid kit from Corsair again the
software needs some help but I'm sure
course there's going to patch that up in
no time I have the utmost confidence in
their team they're a bunch of solid
dudes and dudettes and yeah
