enthusiast apparel awesomesauce shirts
are not only threaded they're hyper
threaded and come factory over cloth get
yours today I'm the awesomesauce -
what's up guys so allow me to preface
this video by saying that I am NOT an
audiophile by any stretch I don't go out
of my way to find only the highest
quality files with lossless compression
nor are my ears sophisticated enough to
pinpoint subtle intricacies on the
frequency spectrum perhaps that's why my
wife always thinks I'm tuning her out
when I really just can't hear her now
that being said I do have a strong
appreciation for quality sound and my
ears still know whether they're being
fed gold or garbage so from a relatively
average joe's perspective today I'll be
testing out some audio hardware from
Mastro's including these k7 xx
headphones from AKG and the deck port
slim from sea entrance so starting with
the headphones the k7 xx is a
collaborative limited edition release
manufactured by AKG and configured by
master up themselves the initiative
comes three years after the critically
acclaimed K 702 65th anniversary edition
and despite borrowing the same 45
millimeter dynamic drivers these 62 ohm
headphones have been fine-tuned to
target a wider frequency response and
soundstage than their unspoken
predecessor at the alluring price point
of just $200 an all-black aesthetic
keeps the cans stylish yet subtle for
those who prefer simplicity and while
the over ear design is definitely on the
bulky side it's as light as a feather
thanks to be thin and flexible yet
sturdy plastic frame I'm gonna go out on
a limb here and say these headphones are
too big to travel with comfortably but
the sound leakage that comes from an
open back design means you're better off
keeping these for home use anyway as to
be courteous to others in public
remember folks sharing is caring
unless it's body odor needles or you're
on the go music the Bungie headband is
made of leather and automatically
adjusts to your head size and this works
alongside the 360 degree ear cuff swivel
to create a truly customized fit for
that lopsided melon of yours as you can
see here it fits mine rather well I'll
admit the clamping force of the headband
could be a bit tighter especially given
the extreme softness and comfort of the
velour covered memory foam
earpads the wide inner diameter also
lets my ears fit perfectly inside
without being rubbed up against making
these headphones even more comfortable
for prolonged use dare I say than my
prized biodynamic dt8 aime pros I'm
gonna call right now guys larger cup
sizes are just better for everyone
included is a detachable ten-foot eighth
inch cable which exits the left ear cup
via a three pin connector and locks
securely into place to prevent
accidental unplugging you also get a
threaded gold-plated quarter inch
adapter as well now up until this point
I've had yet to review a pair of
headphones that rival the heavenly sound
of my dt 880 pros since buying them
three years ago but today I'm absolutely
beside myself when I say that the k7 xx
delivers tremendous quality that matches
and even surpasses in some cases the
sound of my tried-and-true daily drivers
while the soundstage isn't nearly as
open or areas.the 880's there's plenty
of imaging and spaciousness to keep the
sound from feeling enclosed or boxed in
a heavy emphasis on low frequencies
creates an immense base presence that's
tight and articulate without stealing
the show which makes genres like pop
rock EDM dubstep and classic rock an
absolute joy to listen to country still
sounds horrible as usual mids and vocals
also sound crystal clear with a high
level of detail that had me hooked on
Celine Dion for longer than I'm willing
to admit the k7 xx's also perform
wonderfully for gaming I just recommend
picking up something akin to a mod mic
if you plan on voice chatting one word
of caution for potential buyers is that
the drivers are extremely power hungry
and while the advertised 62 ohm
impedance doesn't seem too demanding
please feel closer to my 250 ohm 880's
and I found that playback at max volume
could stand to be a bit louder with some
more oops that brings us right along to
the DAC port slim from C entrance I
couldn't help but be a little skeptical
at first by the looks of this
pocket-sized amp tach combo but Olema
Jebus it seriously took my listening
experience to a whole new level when
plugging in some high impedance
headphones like the k7 xx's and even my
dt8 ATS the unit connects to your laptop
or PC with the included micro USB cable
and features an eighth inch headphone
jack volume wheel and recessed gain
switch there is a universal driver I had
to download but within a minute or two I
was enjoying louder clearer and more
detailed sound that I've
since testing the thousand-dollar Tesla
tyonne's at CES back in January now as
you might imagine the k7 xx's had
already left me impressed on their own
but after connecting the Dec port to it
I derailed entirely from my review
process and went on an hour-long spotify
binge eating up all the ear candy I
could find
needless to say bases were melted those
of you who like your headphones extra
loud will also appreciate the mere
absence of any noticeable noise or
distortion at max volume just be
prepared to get some serious goosebumps
when going to eleven if you don't
already have a sound card or an external
amp tak this unit is definitely worth
the hundred bucks you'll pay for it if
you plan on pairing it with a strong set
of headphones and feeding it good audio
as we round out this review let me just
close by saying it's not too often that
I receive a product from a vendor review
it and then immediately add it to my
personal tech inventory but somehow
today mass drop AKG NC entrants have
managed to make two products which I've
decided to start using on a daily basis
for the foreseeable future because
they're just that good at the moment
they are both sold out on mass drop I
don't want to end on a downer though so
if you'd like to receive a notification
for when they return in November
presumably you can use the links I've
put in the description below and click
the request button so you can snag them
on the next drop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
