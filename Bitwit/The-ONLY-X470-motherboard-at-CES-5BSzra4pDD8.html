to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info what's
going on guys welcome back to the
channel and my coverage of CES 2018 I
had a chance to stop by the gigabyte
Suites today and they actually had some
pretty cool stuff to show off one of
which was an optical mechanical keyboard
which I may be taking a closer look at
in a dedicated video later down the line
but for now I really want to talk about
one product that really piqued my
interest so it's probably gonna pick
yours it's the the new AM for board next
generation for the second generation
rise in CPUs that are not even out yet
um so far it's the only motherboard
manufacturer that I've seen at CES
actually having a board on this on this
chip said that gigabyte was actually not
able to tell me firsthand what the
chipset was but I think we can all
safely assume since AMD's already kind
of announced with that chips that's
gonna be that this is an X 470
motherboard so that's exciting of course
on the am 4 socket and it's it's
actually pretty nice looking board it's
featuring two aluminum fin heat sinks
that span over the entire VRM and those
are bridged by a six millimeter copper
heat pipe that's making direct contact
for increased thermal dissipation we
also have 2 m2 slots one of which is
routed to the PCH the other to the CPU
both of these slots actually have a nice
beefy heatsink cover on them whether or
not that's going to be effective or
helpful or hurtful remains to be seen
after some rigorous testing we also have
an IO shield the rear i/o has plenty of
connectivity options pretty much
anything you might expect from a premium
board here in 2018 and it's also got a
clear CMOS button and the power button
built in so that's really convenient
being able to power on your system is
for example if you're not wired up with
your front I owe you can still power it
on from behind your case even once the
motherboards all installed you don't
have to open up your side panel and hit
the surface mounted power button on the
motherboard itself so that's actually
really handy I like that feature I
haven't seen that before on a board
naturally we get a ton of hours you be
on this board including the digital RGB
area on the i/o shield or the i/o cover
I should say and then normal RGB
elsewhere unfortunately we didn't get to
see this board all lit up they didn't
even have a CPU obvious
to slot it in I guess they could have
used a first generation rise in CPU but
they would have also needed the BIOS
update to make that all work anyway I'm
getting carried away here there are
debug LED switches on the board for
single and dual BIOS modes that's really
nice board features a 10 plus 2 phase
power design for very clean stable power
that's using IR 2 5 603 which is what
gigabyte has used in the past on some of
their boards gigabyte mentioned that
there's been a huge emphasis on memory
compatibility with this new platform
which is really exciting because you
know there was definitely a time there
when the first generation of aim for
boards came out where there was a very
limited selection of which memory kits
you could actually use and run properly
on top of that we're gonna see maximum
supported speeds of ddr4 4,000 megahertz
which is gonna actually makes a
difference this matters because you know
the faster your memory is with an
infinity fabric woven in to these Rison
cpus the higher your in-game performance
is going to be so that's exciting as
well we do have a metallic back plates
that's not full cover or anything but
it's sort of on the upper and right hand
side of the board itself it's mainly for
rigidity and they guest comes with
cosmetics because it does look pretty
cool but gigabyte did mention that it's
not intended for you know reducing
thermals or anything like that more so
just to make sure that the board stays
nice and straight real tech audio with
an ESS saber DAC so great audio features
there overall this board it's not that
it looks it doesn't look terrible at all
for starters but you could definitely
tell that gigabytes focus with with the
gaming 7 Wi-Fi was performance over over
cosmetics and I think that's kind of a
trend that we need to sort of bring back
into the industry after you know the the
RGB craze and just trying to make
everything look pretty and sort of
having actual performance and
functionality fall by the wayside so
kudos to gigabyte can't wait to get my
hands on this board and actually try it
out for the second generation rise and
CP you guys let me know what you think
oh yeah I should say it's coming soon
obviously probably in in April I think
April is when the first first batch of
Verizon as new resin CPUs come out and
then it's gonna retail for 250 us so I
think for all the features you're
getting it's it's pretty justifiable of
course if you're gonna use all those
features if you're only going to use
coupled
maybe not so much I know that a lot of
you guys probably prefer to spend no
more than 100 to 150 on a motherboard so
let me know what you think about this
price point for a mobo for you know the
latest Rison platform in the comments
below as always feel free to toss me a
like on the video if you enjoyed it and
make sure that you're subscribed so you
don't miss any more of my coverage here
at CES 2018 guys thanks for watching and
I will see you all in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
