channel today we are assembling
January's PC of the month the
long-awaited rig that I've been
promising you guys all month sorry it's
a little bit late it's almost February
now but I did get backed up after CES
and all that stuff so it's finally here
though in the flesh I've got all the
parts behind me very exciting stuff this
is going to be a high-end z2 70 gaming
machine so we're going to be able to
pump out some pretty decent frame rates
at hyper 1080 resolutions I wouldn't say
4k 60 on all the games I would say some
some of the games definitely yes but for
the most part what we're looking at here
is quad HD and ultra wide resolutions is
pretty much your sweet spot and we'll be
able to push over 6 well over 60 fps at
those resolutions which is exciting to
say the least now if you guys are new to
my PC of the month series it's basically
a two part video where as the name
suggests every month I build a
full-blown system that's centered around
a use case scenario and/or budget and in
part one of the series which is what
you're watching now for this rig I
basically go over all the parts that I'm
using give a little explanation and then
we kick it off with a nice time-lapse
assembly you can watch me build the damn
thing I look all super fast and there's
cool music in the background makes me
look awesome and then we finish that off
with some sexy b-roll in part 2 which
should probably come within a week or
two after this upload is when we'll
really dive into the testing that
includes overclocking gaming benchmarks
and we'll we also be looking at things
like acoustics and temperature so be
sure to stay tuned for that
but on that note why don't we go ahead
and take a look at the parts that we're
using for this high-end Z 270 gaming
machine so take a look at our case first
this is the fantex enthu pro m mid tower
chassis 420 bucks MSRP this is a pretty
freakin sweet deal here I did opt for
the tempered glass side panel version
and here it is don't be fooled by the
box don't be fooled by the box I think
they just use the same acrylic design
for all their models but if it is an
acrylic panel and I pull this thing out
I will legit inside of this case
you guys know I'm prone to doing that
too but sorry also for forgive via the
nasty grease stains on the box there's
some weird grease issues going on in the
back of my trunk in my car don't ask but
this thing does have some pretty awesome
radiator support as well 360 on the top
or the front right we're not gonna be
putting a 360 in this thing today but
you do have that option available to you
there's also plenty of custom water
cooling support and things like that
additionally we've got our CPU of the
hour
I 777 hundred K from Intel's as part of
their seventh generation KB Lake family
that is their flagship model within that
lineup and it's an overclocker
it's an overclocked beast you can push
this thing all the way up to five
gigahertz and then some if you know what
you're doing and you have the proper
cooling in place so I'm really excited
to be using this again I've been using
it quite a bit on the channel I'm not
tired of it quite yet so that's going to
be having to be cool though pre pretty
significantly by a decent liquid cooler
here so we have the kraken X 62 from
NZXT it's a 280 millimeter rad so I
thought you know what the hell I've been
doing a lot of 240 millimeter rads
lately and this thing is such a damn
heat monster does get pretty hot when
you're overclocking it to the extreme so
two hundred eighty millimeters should
give us just a bit more room for thermal
Headroom and things like that some more
participation than then we might
ordinarily have on a 240 ret also we've
got our memory kit here our Rams our Ram
stuff the rich jaws 5 from J scale this
is a 16 gigabyte kit of ddr4 of course
at 16 no no wow 1600 what is this was a
freaking Sandy Bridge video no this is
3000 megahertz Gio it's freaking 2017
this is the RAM kits can be paired with
this motherboard this is also a beast of
a motherboard this is the Asus tough Z
270 mark 1 and when AC sent this to me I
immediately opened it up in the liquor
shall wing yo-yo give me a straight up
chub and you know features Asus or a
sink and all that stuff it's got thermal
armor which is very unique feature to
the tough series of motherboards and
yeah should be should be pretty kick-ass
I think it's going to look really sick
in the empty pro-am now the graphics
card we're using for this build is
basically our bread and butter for this
whole system it is the star of the show
for the most parts of the EVGA GTX 1080
hybrid which says most of you guys know
features a built-in 120 millimeter
liquid a i/o unit on top of it
integrated pump and all that stuff so
it's good to go it's completely water
cooled out of the box and base clock of
1860 megahertz I believe you know you
got the typical 8 gigs of gddr5 X memory
and all that good stuff we already of
course it will totally crush anything vr
related for sure you can probably even
do like I said earlier maybe some 4k 60
gaming depending on the game but it's
going to just haul ass in our tests I
can't wait to actually get this thing in
the system I've never I've never tried
out one of these firsthand so
this is going to be another first for me
looking forward to seeing what kind of
over clocks we can hit on it and what
kind of frame rates that will yield
we've also got some really nice storage
options for today's build this is the
hellfire nvme SSD MDOT to derive from
patriot the 480 gig model so we'll have
plenty of storage for our operating
system which will be Windows 10 64 bit
of course as well as all of our games
and applications I mean I would say all
of our games but there's definitely a
lot of room here to install at least a
couple Triple A games for really fast
loading times and getting into your
games in your Maps very quickly there's
also two 2.5 gigabytes a second I
believe for for reads and 1.2 gigabytes
there about a second for write so very
fast indeed it's got a slice in five
zero zero seven controller I believe
which just sounds fast and badass and
I'm sure it is going to be plenty fast
for our needs today
we've also got a one terabyte where are
you a one terabyte WD black I thought I
had a 2 terabyte on me but I don't
apparently they're going to using this 1
terabyte today let it be known that if
this is my personal build I would have
definitely upgraded this to a 2 terabyte
hard drive just because I've got quite a
few games nowadays and they're getting
bigger and bigger ever dice so but
that's going to be plenty fine for for
this build we've also got the EVGA
supernova 650 watt g2 fully modular
fully modular I can't talk any more
fully module take a breath Cal fully
modular units 80 plus gold certified
very good certification rating that tons
of efficiency and all that jazz got a
really nice warranty I believe as well
fans we're going to be installing from
the third-party fans here from course
share this is their ML 140 pros we've
got four of them to deal with the two I
work with today I should say nothing
else we've got to deal with these fans
these are they're they're very nice
magnetic levitation fans that I did get
to check out at Computex last year I
hear that they're pretty quiet and the
really nice thing is that they're kind
of balanced for airflow and static
pressure so you can either use them as
case fans or radiator fans so depending
on how things are looking I might
actually slap some of these on to the
crack and x60 to not just because you
know not that I don't have any faith in
the NZXT fans or anything but just maybe
to give it a little bit more of a
personal touch to customise it a bit and
maybe maybe this will be a little bit
quieter I'm not sure we'll test it out
and stuff I also really like the way
they look so it is a bit of an aesthetic
thing for me as well less but not least
we've got the err that
uga power link power link I don't know
if you guys are familiar with this Jade
did a really good video on it it's uh
it's really cool little little unit that
you can actually attach to the front or
the PCIe connectors of your graphics
card and allows you to plug in your
cables from the side of the graphics
card instead of the front just give it a
nice clean look overall the front of
this thing looks really really slick and
I will be using that it's in tandem
today with these fantex pre sleeve
cables in black the 24 pin is not shown
right now but I will be using that as
well I think the power link is going to
be cool especially since I've never used
it before pretty excited to be using all
of that so on that note guys I think
those are all the parts that I miss
anything
no look looks looks pretty good so now
you can just sit back relax and enjoy
the time-lapse as I assemble this
collection of badassery here we go
Oh
all right so here she is folks whoo
looking good I must say holy moley by
the way I'm going handheld now so
forgive any shakiness that may occur but
this is looking pretty sweet I'm really
happy with how this turned out the one
thing that I'll say is sticking out
right now is the orange LED on the
motherboard here on the tough
motherboard but that is RGB so once we
load up Windows 10 we can jump into the
software and you could disable it or
change it to white something that's a
bit more matchy-matchy but apart from
that looking pretty good really loving
how the fans turned out as well how they
look pretty sweet in this chassis with
everything else the one thing that will
said that you might have noticed there
were a couple changes that I made along
the way during the time lapse that were
not addressed at the beginning of the
video first of which was the ramp so
instead of using the rip jobs of four or
sorry rip jobs five g-scale I swapped
those up from some dumb class and course
share also a 16 gigabyte kit at 3,000
megahertz but I just felt that there was
nothing silver in the build to match the
the silver accent on the GPU shroud here
so I wanted to kind of make it a bit
more cohesive so this is mainly just for
aesthetic purposes
I threw it a bit more silver into the
build overall and I think it was a good
choice
I'm happy with that decision because I
think it just ties everything together a
little bit nicer so yeah that was that
was one thing the other thing is uh I
can address the the radiator
configuration here and how I set that up
so I got the CPU a IO which is at the
front of the case as an intake this is
in push-pull so I've got the the stock
ng XP fans on the front that you can't
really see then I've got the two of the
ML 140 s right there we're even fresh
air into the chassis and then we've also
got the the GPU AO which is mounted to
the back of the case as an exhaust now
one concern I might have when I was
looking at this after I built it with if
there's if the fuel exhaust fans appear
that ml 140 is a pop are going to be
stealing any airflow
from the from the radiator back here for
a GPU so as air comes in I'm hoping that
it doesn't get sucked up and exhausted
before it ever reaches the red and I'm
going to be doing some testing on that
perhaps in part two of this video or
maybe it's worth a standalone video
maybe I won't include it in part two and
I'll just do a separate video on it
altogether let me know what you guys
think so the other thing I wanted to
mention is the hard drive I completely
overlooked the fact that if you're
installing a 280 rad at the front of
this case then you lose pretty much you
have to uninstall the hard drive cage
that's down there which which houses two
three and a half inch mechanicals
natively so I had to remove that and I
was like where do I put my
mechanical drive so what I ended up
doing was just mounting it by chance
there's happened to be two slots at the
bottom of the case for for mounting a
pump that's where your pump mount would
go for custom water cooling it's not
meant for hard drives at all but somehow
I managed to get two screws in there and
kind of bolt it down however I wasn't
able to get the the whatchamacallit but
the hard drive completely flush with the
bottom of the chassis because there were
four those SSD screws basically for
these things for these bad boys because
you can mount the SSD tray if you're
here or at the bottom of the case or
behind the motherboard so there was a
quad of those at the bottom of the case
so the hard drive is actually resting on
top of it which looks a little awkward
but it actually kind of worked out
because it's still really stable and it
also kind of provides just a little bit
of lift at the end of that hard drive so
it's a bit easier to connect like the
SATA cables and stuff like that so I'm
pretty happy with how that turned out
I don't think it's too big of an issue
but apart from that it's looking pretty
good the only thing you can't really see
apart from the hard drive is the SSD the
m2 Patriot hell fire in there but it
went in like a champ went in like a
charm and you kind of covered up by the
shroud that's on the test motherboard
but I think that's that's pretty much
all I want to say this is a pretty solid
build that went very smoothly of course
of course there's like any build there's
a couple workarounds that you have to
kind of improvise with but I'm very
satisfied with its overall you guys let
me know what you think about it in the
comments and if you think you're it let
me know if it's a refreshing change to
see a system that's not just riddled
with RGB LEDs because I'm pretty I'm
pretty sick of that for at least for a
while
but that is going to do it for now guys
I didn't really plan out how I was going
to frame the shot so I'm kind of like
crouching right now
awkward camera angle hopefully if you'll
forgive me and it's also a little bright
when we turn that down yeah yeah but
that's going to do it for now guys thank
you very much for watching and also
thanks to my sponsors who stuff this up
D scale is not a sponsored by the way so
I didn't like victim over by swapping in
the corsair module just in case you were
wondering but that's going to do it now
talk to me like and all that jazz
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already part 2 coming very soon I
promise I will get around to that sooner
than I did with this initial part 1 and
February is around the corner so stay
tuned for February can see the month as
well on top of all the other tech stuff
that I've got going on on the channel I
love you guys I don't want to go right
now just I'm gonna miss you so much I
mean I'm kidding bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
