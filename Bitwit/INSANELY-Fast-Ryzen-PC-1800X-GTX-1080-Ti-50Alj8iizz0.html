the channel hope you're all doing well
today we are building yet another high
end risin 7pc and before you guys say
anything I already know what you're
thinking you're thinking Kyle why not
arise in five film rise in five just
logs that's what we care about we want
to see we've already seen rise in seven
builds I understand and before you go
any further I just want to say that I do
have a really killer budget r5 build in
the works it's actually we I'm waiting
on like two more parts and that's the
only reason why I'm not shooting it
today because I'm sewing on those parts
to get in but it will be awesome and it
will be coming next week sometime that
notes we're going to be doing a ride in
seven system again although it's going
to be quite different
mind you than the ones I built for March
SPCO month by the way this is not a PC
of the month no no no the risin 5 bill
that I was just talking about is going
to be April's PC of the month again if
you'd give it a give it a week or so get
subscriber the channel salem if it's
going to be awesome
so this is also another disclaimer this
is a be quiet sponsored build sponsored
by the folks over it be quiet so thank
them for allowing this build to be
happen allowing this what a might what
am i allowing this build to happen
because it's going to be glorious and
we've got a huge lineup of some awesome
hardware as well so without further ado
let's go ahead and take a look at all
the glorious parts sitting behind me I
like saying glorious a lot I feel like
glorious is like the it's like the
adjective of the PC master-race probably
because they say glorious pc masterrace
anyway let's take a look at the hardware
no I'm not on drugs
alright so as I mentioned this is going
to be a Rison 7 system but instead of
going with the 1700s like we did last
month we're going with an 1800 X this
time around
simply because I just have a thing where
I want to I want to do a build with an
1800 X just to say that I I used the
fastest-rising ship available in a
system so I think that's pretty cool and
additionally even though you can get
pretty closer than the performance of an
1800 X simply by overclocking your 1700
with some high-speed memory you can
still please probably an additional one
or two hundred megahertz out of an 1800
X that you might have a hard time with
unless you have a heavily Bend r7 1700 s
so and especially given the fast GPU
that we're gonna be pairing with this
thing it's kind of nice to have that
additional performance it will probably
let our graphics card shine
a little bit more in more cpu-bound
titles so cool in the damn thing is the
be quiet dark rock 3 and I actually
review this cooler about I'd say I feel
like 2 years ago now and still till this
day it's one of the coolers that I
always go to for recommendations for
people who are looking for air coolers
within the price range of 70 to 80 bucks
simply because a it performs
fantastically and of course it's super
silent as well
additionally it just looks fantastic
this is one of the better-looking air
coolers in the last ever like just
period it's just absolutely a work of
art on top of that they you can actually
order an a m4 bracket for free on be
quiet website assuming that you've
ordered one of their parts legitimately
so if you just punch in the information
for whatever product you ordered you can
get one of those a m4 brackets like the
one I have for motherboards like this
this is the Auris xax 370 gaming k7 from
gigabyte and it's all this board and
immediately was like I need this in my
life
gigabyte give this to me and they
actually put it on hold it took them a
while though I think they ran out of
supply in the US so they had to pull
inventory from Latin America or
something because look at Ultra servicio
all old the last IV steel I'm going to
do my next review and just Spanish hope
that's okay with everyone what a guest
at the end it'll be great but this
motherboard is absolutely kick-ass just
in terms of the aesthetic I can't wait
to actually test it and see how it
performs and just how it overclocks with
the 1800 X up there but just a couple
random features here USB 3.1 gen2 as
well as nvme PCIe you to nm to support
RGB lighting which is going to tie in
nicely with our color scheme today which
is orange in case you couldn't tell yet
and yeah there's just a lot of a lot of
nice little features here that I'm sure
going to be able to utilize by the end
of this bill did I mention its B already
pledged better so that's better than all
the other Motherhood way I think all the
motherboards would be already now
gigabyte needs to change it to like VR
ready X gaming age looks like now as
many of you guys are probably aware by
now risin can benefit significantly from
being paired with a high-speed memory
kit so here we've got some G skills
Flair X this is a brand new kit that is
compatible with Verizon there are a lot
of kits that are technically going to
work with an AM 4 platform how
there might be finicky they might not
work 100% you might have to dial in some
some settings manually or to get the you
know the rated speeds to operate
properly
things like that this should just work
out of the box I'm hoping rather the
package but we'll see we'll see how
exactly how smooth it goes I'm going to
try to overclock if possible if once we
do part two of this bill because right
now we're rocking at thirty two hundred
megahertz by default would like to push
that up to maybe thirty six hundred if
we're lucky well we'll take a look at it
later but overall very nice kit did I
mention it 16 gigs I think I did okay
let's move on I take a look at this
thing right yeah holy it's the
nicest ROG Strix gtx 980ti guys the one
that i did a review on very recently
those you should check it out because
it's interesting yeah this card is
awesome and like I said I wanted to go
all-out for this rig which is why maybe
it sort of makes sense now why I got the
1800 ex because this is right now why
you move was it was the king of GPUs
until Nvidia pulled a fast one on us
with the Titan X little P but still a
beast of a card guys I suggest you check
out that review for more information
including benchmarks and stuff so we are
already kind of know how this is going
to stack up against a founders edition
gtx 1080i and things like that but we're
going to be testing with an 1800 extra
time around instead of like seventy
seven hundred K which is what I believe
I tested it with in the review so super
excited to use this car the cooler is
just absolutely bonkers
it's a incredibly quiet for the thermal
dissipation that it actually performs
with and it's just a very nice looking
card as well I think it's going to look
beautiful with the rest of our hardware
here today it says D we've got a Samsung
850 Evo don't need to talk too much
about this it's 250 gig capacity to
store our operating system and some
basic applications rockin that beam and
of course it's a tried-and-true drive
we're all pretty familiar with it by now
it's a great price as well and it should
do the job just fine we've also got a
one terabyte WD black if this was my
personal gaming PC one terabyte is all I
need because my Steam library isn't so
massive compared to some of you guys I
know I'm a poser I'm a casual for yet so
there we go that's our storage
configuration there and let's see oh
let's move up here power supply here
power 10 again for be quiet this is an
absolutely gorgeous unit and the case
that were rocking today
doesn't have a basement cover so in that
case literally you kind of want a nice
looking power supply right otherwise you
got to do a little bit of work maybe
some modifications in order to make it
look good this just looks good out of
the box period it's fantastic I love the
direction that these new power supplies
would be quite a bit going there's a 600
watt of course 80 plus silver and it's
you can see there it's partially modular
and it just looks it just looks
absolutely gorgeous the thing that I
really like about this unit also is that
it comes with those black flat cables so
even if you didn't have say a extension
kit a sleeve extension kit like the one
we have from cable mod today it's still
going to look really nice in your system
and it's going to be color neutral to
match with whatever color scheme you
might want to be going with so overall a
very nice package the last part to the
puzzle is the chassis of course also
from our sponsor this is the be quiet
pure base 604 110 dollars MSRP which is
for the model that you see before me
including the orange accents and
tempered glass side panel which will get
a better look at once the system's all
assembled you actually get quite a bit
for your money so this is first and
foremost a case that's tailored for
silent operation especially with some of
the other quiet parts that we have in
here that are also from be quiet go
figure this is going to be a really
quiet system once it's all done I reckon
so we've got tons of ass and sound
dampening material for instance at the
front and and the the side panel back
there but you've also got this little
panel up here at the top so obviously
right now it sits in quiet mode there's
not too much ventilation other than a
few slots at the back but you can remove
this and open it up for three hundred
and sixty millimeter radiators there's
some flexible mounting strips under
there
so that's actually really great to have
that sort of radiator support with a
case that's in this price point let's
see what other goodies we have here is
that a fan controller oh yes that's the
three-speed fan controller I believe you
can connect I remember correctly up to
three fans to that bad boy and I just
love how like solid feeling it is you
know you usually see built-in fan
controllers they're really shitty but
this one's super high quality as is the
power button everything just feels built
to last for sure that German engineering
let me tell you the fans in here are
also pretty killer you've got two pure
wings two fans one 120 at the back and
actually gave you 140 at the front which
is pretty generous I thought they were
both 120 s but you get a 140 at the
front which is nice proper dust
filtration in all the places you might
expect
our supply and at the front there we've
also got some modular drive cage trays
here this is also familiar from what
we've seen from be quiet in the past
they kind of just allow you to configure
it any way you want one at a time I'll
look art or you can remove them entirely
you want to open up the case for a bit
more airflow indeed that is super cool
and cable management in this guy is
supposed to be pretty good from what
I've heard I've actually watched or read
a couple reviews online there's plenty
of grommets I can tell there and there
they're highlighted in orange so how
could you miss them and I think the back
is actually let's see got probably oh
yeah you got probably like
three-quarters to an inch of room back
there so I am of the utmost confidence
going into this build that it will go
smoothly
what on that note ladies and gentlemen
those are all the parts that we'll be
using for this high-end Rison seven 1800
X and GTX 1080p I gaming monster I'm
pumped are you pumped I'm pumped
alright let's go ahead and build this
thing well first I have to pee and then
and then we'll do that I'm not going to
film that part though all right let's
just
all right build complete looking pretty
good actually I really like how it
turned out as you can see I've already
configured all the LEDs inside the
system to be Forge thanks to the the
gigabyte RGB fusion software as well as
Asus aura for the video cards speaking
of the video card hella on that bad
boy as I also noted in my review pretty
atrocious and that is with both thumb
screws in in the review I only had one
thumb screw and people are like well no
wonder they're sad because you only have
one thumb screw and it doesn't really
matter guys because it's not actually
reinforcing the other parts of the GPU
that extends way way out anyway
what can you do fagor is going to sag
and the cables the PCIe cables I
actually misjudged or I went with the
the gtx 980ti Strix at the last minute
initially it was going to be a GPU that
only had a single eight pins this card
has two eight pin plugs so I was
actually won a pin short in my extension
kit from cable mods so that's why you
see one black and one from the kit so
it's a little off a little bit
mismatched but I think it works it
doesn't take away from the rest of the
build it's not too distracting the other
thing i want to mention is that the the
cooler the dark rock 3 you can see that
it's mounted horizontally with the fan
perpendicular I'm sorry parallel to the
graphics card pushing air up in case you
were wondering generally I prefer to
mount the cooler is more more vertical
so that the fan is blowing air towards
the rear of the case instead of the top
but that's just the nature of this
cooler and the am4 bracket there's no
other as far as like the manual said and
I couldn't really figure out how to
mount it vertically so just rather than
mine it's actually not too big of a deal
because the gaming k7r Oris board here
actually leaves quite a bit of space
between the cooler and the graphics card
in that top PCIe slot so I'm not too
concerned about thermals one more thing
I want to mention cable management cable
management was very easy actually I was
little concerned at first because it's
been a while I think since I built in a
mid tower case that didn't have a power
supply basement or a power supply sure I
would just stuff all the cables in there
but it was actually super easy and
simple there's a ton of room back there
as I mentioned earlier and after I was
done just you know spending five ten
minutes strapping things down that side
panel that back side panel went on no
problem there was like no resistance
whatsoever so altogether a solid build
that's pretty much going to conclude for
now thank you again to our sponsor my
sponsor be quiet for making this build
possible guys if you enjoyed the video
be sure to toss me a like on it and yeah
subscribe to the channel there's a lot
of tech stuff that I've got in the works
right now coming very soon including
that risin 5 budget built which is going
to be awesome so stay tuned for all that
I'll catch you guys in the next one well
hold on I am an idiot and I completely
forgot to talk about one of the most
important things here about this build
is the noise and it's it's very quiet
it's idling right now and it is audible
granted I'm like 2 inches away from it
you can make basically here the the rear
fan here but it's really just whisper
quiet I mean if I just get a little bit
further away from it sound sound kind of
goes away but the only other fans that
are spinning right now in this idle
state are the 140 at the front and 140
on the cooler because remember the three
fans that are on the graphics card or
zero decibel fans and they won't ramp up
unless the GPU gets around 55 degrees
Celsius or hotter
so overall a very silent system I mean I
wouldn't expect anything less from
building a system with components
primarily made from a company called be
quiet so again thank you guys for
watching have a go on I'll get out of
your hair now please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
