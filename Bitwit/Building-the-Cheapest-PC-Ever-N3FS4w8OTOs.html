expensive liquid-cooled PC nearly
complete I thought it'd be fun to switch
things up a bit and test my frugality by
building the absolute cheapest PC money
can buy the goal of this build is to
create a low powered office workstation
or HTPC for as little dough as humanly
possible we're also going to stay away
from buying used components in this
video so we don't have any doubts about
how much mileage our parts have been
through I should also mention that
everything here had to be purchased from
US retailers and that the final cost of
the build does not include an operating
system so diving right into it let's
check out the parts and prices for our
dirt-cheap PC for the CPU I've chosen
the Sempron 3850 from AMD which is
rocking their 28 nanometer kabini
architecture this a 1 socket apu sips on
25 watts of power at one point 3
gigahertz features the Radeon HD 8220
integrated GPU and sports 4 physical
cores making this quad-core CPU in
absolute steel at just 30 bucks I'll be
pairing the chip with the AM 1b ITX from
asrock the Mini ITX board supports ddr3
up to 1600 front panel and rear i/o USB
3.0 and a variety of video outputs for
connecting up to 2 monitors I managed to
pick this up for a measly $35 to cut
costs down will only be populating one
of the board's DIMM slots so for memory
we have a 4 gigabyte ddr3 module from
Kingston at 1600 megahertz this single
stick set me back a whopping 21 dollars
for storage I found this 160 gig hard
drive on Amazon for just 14 bucks its
5400 rpm 3.5 inch and so cheap it
doesn't even have a brand name listed on
the product page
it wasn't until unboxing the drive in
person that I learned it to be a Samsung
unit and apart from being the cheapest
drive I could find online I'm fairly
curious to see just how far this thing
will go before kicking the bucket and
finally to kill two birds with one stone
I searched high and low for a small
form-factor case with a built-in power
supply what I found was this Lodge
assist 6801 with an included 350 watt
unit despite its shoddy construction it
manages to squeeze in an external
to dry Bay USB 3 port card reader and
the ability to stand vertically which is
ideal for the living room that is until
it goes up in flames thanks to the
cheapy power supply
however at just 40 bucks I suppose I
have no choice but to roll the dice on
this questionable combo when all is said
and done the total cost of our
poor-man's build comes out to just 140
USD that's more than I spend on gas in a
single month or about how much YouTube
money I make in a single week sure it's
rather sluggish when traversing through
the OS and it certainly can't play games
worth a damn but it handles simple tasks
like 1080 video playback and OpenOffice
without a hitch which is exactly what
it's intended for well this is
definitely the cheapest PC I've ever put
together I'm almost positive that you
guys can find some way to make it even
cheaper so go ahead and leave your
suggestions or PC port picker lists in
the comments below but that's going to
do it for now guys before you go feel
free to share this build with your
friends and toss me a like on this video
