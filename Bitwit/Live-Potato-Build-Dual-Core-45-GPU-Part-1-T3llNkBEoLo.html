yeah doesn't see me yo yo yo sup bitches
yeah I know it's almost a midnight so if
it's past your bedtime then go the eff
to sleep alright how about that yeah I'm
late I'm like you know what great thing
about the Internet is that you don't
have to watch everything at the time
that there's you can watch it later
people gosh why is freaking precision X
still running Jesus
okay um aw do you guys are probably like
why is the audio not working let me go
ahead and fix that general audio
microphone default boom apply okay boom
yeah does it do you guys do you guys do
you guys hear anything
is it does it sound good if I do this
let me know let me know you fools about
the chart
man chat you're like my lifeline
why you scream boy yeah yeah alright
cool cool cool cool
um alright I don't know why that's doing
that crazy sounds good alright cool
sounds good well sounds
good enough for me
well you know what guys this is what I'm
working with tonight I will explain all
tied shenanigans in good time let me
just go ahead and sneak by yeah all
right I got a position the mic you guys
get to see all the setup stuff although
all the works and you know what I'm
gonna I'm going to go back over here and
enlarge the chat I forget some of you
guys were like on the other side of the
world I'm like you're actually at school
and sorry about that it's lux
this anymore why this is not good bigger
why well done chat oh you know don't do
no no do guys you know do oh I'm sorry
this is so half-assed I mean would you
guys expect anything less from me I
don't think so
but but hang in there you're doing great
I see skies of blue and clouds of gray I
know the yeah oh yes it's pretty much
midnight where I'm at right now
and that's a problem
it's definitely a problem sorry for the
bad camera quality guys and I'm trying
to read chat ah ah ah it's too far so
I'm cracking up in my tablet my tablet
will tell me what's going on good old
Nexus 7 um so what's the deal right it's
it's almost midnight my time and Here I
am starting a stream what the hell is
wrong with this guy right am I right or
am i right I'm right
ah well initially my plan for this
week's video was to do some benchmarks
on Tom Clancy's the division which just
launched earlier this week published by
Ubisoft and developed by massive but you
know what life doesn't always care about
your plans sometimes life's just like
you Cal okay if you want to bench my way
you want to benchmark the division you
kow so instead of allowing me to proceed
with my benchmarks the game was entirely
buggy and a complete prick in my opinion
and it took me about eight hours to run
six benchmarks and I wasn't happy with
that wasn't satisfied with the results
that I got out of the time that I put
into it wasn't gonna be a good video so
I scrapped it completely and decided you
know what I'm gonna I'm gonna put the
division on pause for now there's plenty
of other good resources out there for
for the division benchmarks and things
like that so I was like what can I do
that's different
um and that's that's why you're all
watching me now because because because
because because because because of the
wonderful things he does oh um I'm going
to be building a computer I guess you
could call it that because it will be
functional in the end it's going to be a
budget system I'm going the total total
other route
nothing division related here it's going
to be a super budget system using a dual
core Pentium G 32:58
from Intel anniversary edition of course
which is overclockable with this H 81 +
motherboard yes you can overclock this
chip with this board it's going to be a
super budget system here guys and also
featuring the GeForce qt6 110 that you
haven't even heard of this card actually
probably have but we're never interested
in it because it's a $45 GPU not that
that's useful to anyone or is it I don't
know that's the whole point of this
video I guess so in four gigs of RAM so
what I'm really doing here is I'm
compiling a very very budget system and
in part 2 of this series this miniseries
I'm actually going to benchmark it and
see what what kind of things can you do
what kind of games can you play what
kind of applications can you run with a
dual-core processor system that has a
$45 video card in it because honestly I
look at this video card in at first
glance I think well something like you
know a 78 70 K or like a you know an AMD
APU
would pretty much fit the place of this
but who knows maybe there is still some
some reason or some purpose to picking
up a 45 dollar video card these days I
don't know
I really haven't run the tests yet but
eventually the data will tell the story
um and let us know exactly how much
functionality we can get out of this
super budget rig and sorry if I'm
rambling I'm just trying to kill time
while I load up the youtubes right now
it's being super slow gosh Nexus 7 gosh
in the mean time beer check ballast
point pineapple sculpin always good how
you guys doing yeah well it's like
morning for some of you guys I'm sorry
I'm sorry that you have to wake up to
this because this is really not a Polish
dream whatsoever
I literally installed xsplit on hotline
like three minutes ago and I'm guessing
there's got to be some audio video
desync going on here right now but who
knows at any rate I don't want to
discover what's trending on YouTube
YouTube who cares
sorry guys I'm get very short with
YouTube sometimes and apparently it's
not letting me view my livestream that's
going on right now which is a complete
joke oh that is so frustrating hey don't
you know mmm-hmm wow I guess I can't
view live streams through the YouTube
app well hey there's a shortcoming okay
oh boy well I might have to download the
studio app oh this is gonna be shitty
your table story or story or open oh
I've already got it installed I'm so on
top of things could you have me
hmmmm-hmmm
spoke too soon videos and of course it
doesn't display my my stream or anything
like that ok you know what screw it I'm
gonna do one last attempt to try to
enlarge the chat window on hotlines
monitor here because it's play over here
I would really like to see what you guys
are all saying so I can like reply to
you instead but damn bro
but from a GERD ermahgerd for some
reason it just doesn't want to increase
in size here you guys are seeing my butt
but oh yeah that's the booty that's the
booty yeah hey hey yeah yeah you get a
high five y'all can get a high five
stupid so so bad all right here we go
okay ah let's just build this thing all
right so apart from CPU motherboard and
video card which I've already discussed
we've got four gigs of RAM I didn't want
to go eight gigs because this is a super
budget system so we're going for gigs
we're trying to see how much we can get
away with with as little as possible
hardware wise so we've got a four gig
stick of Ripjaws from good old g.skill
this is ddr3 of course because we're on
H 81 and we're using an Intel stock
cooler of course we've got a 64 gig
crucial m4 SSD this is old-school guys I
mean this was I purchased this back in
2011 when I don't know it was like three
dollars a gig and now it's like 30 cents
a gig more or less so this is a 64 gig
SSD but we've also got a 2 terabyte WD
black obviously I'm not recommending
that you guys purchase this selection of
hardware if you want a budget build I'm
just using what I have available really
and we've also got this old-school 650
watt and tech 25 platinum it is 80 plus
platinum which I guess is pretty cool
that's a power supply it does feature
the nasty ketchup and mustard cables
however
so we're going to have to live with that
for now as far as the case goes we have
none because honestly guys this this
video this this little miniseries here
is strictly about performance and
essentially how much mileage we can get
out of the the core components so a case
doesn't really factor into this plus I
don't really have a case to to really
suit this build so we're just gonna
build it externally we're gonna do a
little a little external open open-air
chassis if you will and I guess this is
a good opportunity to see how you might
go about building a computer if it's
your first time I like to start with the
motherboard I think most people do the
motherboard is the backbone of your
system essentially it is the centerpiece
if you will that connects all of the
components to a central hub and that is
what we're gonna be doing right now so
we've got this little cheapy mini ITX
this is a mini ITX board it's it's
pretty bare-bones
there's nothing really fancy about it
it's super budget it's a CH 81 of course
which means it's affordable but it does
have you know it does have all the
things you would need for a budget
system that being said doesn't have
Wi-Fi built in there is an H 81m Wi-Fi I
believe that asrock offers but to hell
with it
pop off the CPU plate open up that
socket yeah yeah and then you're gonna
want to take up the CPU right here I
should also mention that the reason why
I'm doing this stream like if this seems
really impromptu and out of character
from what the channel usually is it's
because it is and the reason why I'm
doing this video or why I decided or
resorted to doing this type of video is
because I was originally going to do
some benchmarks on the division and I
probably mentioned this already just had
a few drinks and I can't remember the
last ten minutes but it was giving me
massive issues so I spent about eight
was trying to do that division video
till I finally gave up so yeah I was
pretty lit it's pretty light you know fu
be soft if you guys hate Ubisoft for one
reason or another let me know in chat
because honestly I won't I won't defend
them I will I will stand by you in every
sense of the argument because they have
effed me over one too many times
CPU installed it's as easy as that folks
and next we'll go on to our RAM let's go
ahead and install this sucker make sure
to get both latches down on the DIMM
slots boom look at that it's beautiful
we're like we're like halfway there
thank you for the donation who's an Eric
AK I can barely anyone who donates
you're gonna make you're gonna have to
make me lean over like an old grandma to
really see who what your name is cuz
it's so far away thank you Eric for the
donation I'm out of beer if only there
was another beer bottle I could oh
here's one yeah
all right rock on rock on alright umm
thermal paste application here we go
we've got some some from noctua
this is from the the nth one or this is
the nth one thermal paste we're going to
go ahead and apply the grain of rice
method that I like to abide by Lube you
don't need that much especially on the
Intel chips such as this one that's
relatively small and if you're dealing
with x99 for example you're going
haswell-e
that's a much larger uh which we call it
heat spreader it's a much larger heat
spreader and you will need significantly
more thermal paste because of it because
but because we're dealing with a smaller
chip we don't need that much so um a
little grain of rice sized blob of
thermal paste will do and we're just
going to apply this Intel stock cooler
so
you line up the things and you push the
things in make sure the things are in
guys you want to make sure the things
are in the things and I probably need a
flathead screwdriver so give me one
moment
oh I fish that out here we go here we go
ha ha ha oh yes we are in business now
folks no we're not
what's going on get in there all right I
don't know about you guys but the Intel
stock cooler is so much more a pan they
asked to install than the Intel thought
cooler it's just I don't know the push
pin and the push pin scenario is not
working for me
and it really never has is even working
what's going on I don't even know like
yeah
how's happening hell's happening
so that looks through that looks through
uh-huh
we've got three of four three or four
got one one straggler here that needs to
be disciplined haha there we go there we
go all right now we've got a good Intel
stock cooler on there who's out here sin
I guess a drunk Kyle has lost skills but
it can run division ah nope yeah I'm
gonna lose my I lost my a long
time ago with the division guys oh you
you guys don't even know like how
frustrated I am with that game right now
I had a good 45-minute run being
recorded on OBS with that game and it
was it was good it was a good video
y'all and then my system crashed which
it doesn't it never crashes hotline
never crashes unless you run the
division and if you guys know anything
about mp4 recording if you're recording
an mp4 and you don't stop the recording
manually it does not save to your system
so I lost that 45 minute clip which was
pretty much the entire video I was very
upset about it and it can never be
recreated Hey look I have another Intel
stock cooler but I'm not gonna use it
all right at this time we can go ahead
and proceed to opening up the Vidia CAD
with my handy dandy nice go ahead and
slice this guy open ah always uh how is
use protection kids oh Jesus I sorry I
meant to do that
I mean I'm Aboriginal okay um looks like
you open it from here I love I love how
much thinner this box is than any other
video cart that I've dealt with in the
past four years
however oh come on yeah man don't play
don't play footsie with me
all right video card acquired video
corticoid so look at this all right so
here's the video card uh it's just a
little thing all right very modest
looking it's got a little heat sink on
it with a tiny I don't know maybe a 30
millimeter fan I don't know it's it's
it's II bit see obviously it doesn't
require any other power other than
what's being received through the PCI
bus PCIe bus and we're gonna go ahead
and install it as is cuz it's good to go
yo boom
get in there what's wrong why are you
being shy ha ha ha ha ha cuz there's a
little latch a little latch there we go
alright so here we go guys here's our
build thus far the video card there get
the CPU and the cooler and our four gigs
of RAM I'm actually very curious to see
what this little system here is going to
be capable of and really what kind of
games it's going to be able to run I'm
not expecting anything fantabulous
y'all I know it's not gonna be able to
play like the division or battlefield 4
or something like that but you know if
you can save a
 ton of money on building a system
like this it'd be interesting to know
what kind of applications are what kind
of games you'll be able to get away with
at medium high quality settings at HD
potentially this could make for a very
good HTPC I can already tell that I've
built far cheaper systems in the past
that have been able to run you know HD
blu-rays and things like that
effortlessly so I'm feeling pretty
optimistic about this so far why don't
we go ahead and move on to our I guess
the power supply be the next logical
step if we had a case involved even
though we don't even though we don't
we're going with the power supply I'm
sorry I'm not like the more responsive
with chat right now because uh my
monitor is a bit too far away at the
moment and I can't really see what you
guys are typing but I'm sure you're all
being exceptionally respectful and not
saying anything bad about me cuz that
never happens on the internet so we've
got our 24 pin hahahaha and luckily we
don't need any GPU cables so really we
just got our CP oh and this being a
budget motherboard we only need a four
pin connector from our EPS boom and then
that's just a matter
Oh drives 64 gig crucial m for my first
ever SSD my first true love still kickin
still going strong the funny thing about
the crucial m fours fun fact is that
they they weren't really like privy to
the whole notion of showing off your
SSDs they were still in like that same
hard drive hard drives are ugly
mentality so they put their their vanity
sticker on the opposite side of what you
would typically find these days on an
SSD so if you are
try to install a crucial m4 in say an H
440 or like let's say the NZXT Manta
where you have the the SSD showing there
on the wall you would actually be
showing the the boring side with no with
no frills attached instead of instead of
the pretty pretty cosmetic area but I'm
sure they've picked up on that since
then with their B x-series gonna go
ahead and connect this to the board
alright
boom it's it's amazing how much easier
building a PC is when you don't have to
deal with the case now that seems very
obvious thank you very much bill bill
thank you for the donation bill sorry
you're making me squint
I appreciate it Beretta we do have a
Santa connector her but I gotta connect
right now and I'm not gonna even connect
the our two terabyte WD black here folks
I just want to get a good indication of
whether or not this thinking booth and
if it can we're in business and you will
be seeing a part two of this video where
I benchmark the damn thing and see what
is really capable of a dual-core $45 GPU
system should be interesting right let's
power the on so I need to first off
a monitor monitor check ow ow next next
i need cables I need power and I need
video so I do have a dual link DVI cable
right here station to think of education
one moment guys one more months don't
like it much do right now at 6:30 in the
morning anyway 1:00 in the morning
wherever you are okay oh but you know
what oh I do I don't have a DVI on the
back the video card so I can't use this
connector this paper is a pee repair yes
yes don't worry it's just a it's just a
DVI cable no no big deal all right
so we're going to connect it back and
then we get I feel like mad Frankenstein
right now they've got the power cable
power cable power cable okay where's our
cable
aha tell me tell me it I found it at a
time not my desk I need to go fish it
out ah
I hope it's this one oh that's it yeah
it has to be it now if if the stream if
the stream dies out of nowhere right now
in the next 30 seconds is because I
actually pulled the wrong power cable so
bear that in mind
thank you Thank You Josh for the
donation here we go
fingers crossed guys fingers effing
is it working is it working guys
is it working oh my god
yep I pulled the note I actually pulled
the right power cable out except I
inadvertently tap the the yes the off
switch on the power strip in the in the
process so yep total derp on my end
dirt move understood okay it's working
now yes yes and most of you dropped out
but that's okay hey hey I'm back I'm
back right just crap I look really
creepy in this dark silhouette okay okay
cool tell me tell me if you can hear me
can you hear me
yay yes this is the best string ever I
should do this more often okay
alrighty there alrighty
oh okay this is great oh no I don't want
to do that
don't do that what are you doing cow
what's audio oh no no no no no no I want
to change the size of the X clip not
this dream not this dream itself okay
shall we continue off where we left off
ladies and folks ah
alright don't mind anything that just
happened in the last five minutes it's
all okay I'm going to connect this to
the monitor haha we need power when you
power when you power power power and
got power right here of course it's
tangled of course you get away get away
you for my thing ah ha ha okay alright
we're good we're good
I'm gonna move my big fat office chair
out of the way so that I can see what
you're saying
and with this with this ladies and
gentlemen I will power on the system
where it is it power from is it a power
button here we are
ah yet the stock cooler stock cooler is
moving ow yes oh yeah oh we're good
no we're good totally good get out get
away from that thing all right cool cool
beans look at that yeah so we we have a
boot more or less more or less we have
booted this is good news folks I don't
think my room has ever been more of a
wreck than it is now whoa oh oh all
right so I'm gonna put the mic here move
the camera a little bit over here yeah
so you get a get a look at my system
here whoo nothing's wrong with the hard
drive
it's just trying to detect a boot device
which is perfectly normal I can handle
that no problem so hey
guys this is it this is the system all
booted up no case the table is the case
for tonight and we are ready to go on to
phase two in in part two of this
miniseries that I just impromptu it idli
draft it up out of my butt hello yes
awesome so I guess the next step here
would be to install Windows and then
maybe install a couple games to see
exactly what this little little rig this
half-assed rig that we've just assembled
in 20 minutes or so is a is capable of
I'm very curious I hope you guys are too
but yeah yeah there's more beard
there's more beer you're right I don't
know what do you guys what do you guys
think of this type of a video on YouTube
I'm familiar with this sort of format on
twitch because twitch is a little bit
more loose and lacks I know YouTube's a
little just by nature a bit more
expectant of a more crafted and polished
video where you've got a script or or
even if you're just logging to the
camera but more direction definitely
more than what you've seen here today
or tonight or this morning or whatever
um but I don't know this was fun this
was really fun as impromptu as it was so
guys let me know let me know your
thoughts go ahead and toss me a like on
the video if you enjoyed this whole the
charade of mess and chaos and either way
even if you hated it I will still be
following up with this little bill that
we have here to really see what we can
do with this budget system oh yeah but I
think that's going to be hit for now
guys thank you so much for tuning in I
know this was super unexpected and not
like anything I've done before at least
on YouTube so I appreciate you guys
coming out and showing some support
having like I think I saw 800 of you
guys were watching it once at some point
that's freaking excellent
so thank you guys and yeah we're gonna
go test this sucker out in a bit and
we'll be back with more results I'm
gonna gonna drink some more bear all
right you guys have a good night guys
I'm gonna go ahead and cut this off have
sweet dreams or have a good day if it's
the morning top of the morning to you -
yes hahaha
all right good bye good bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
