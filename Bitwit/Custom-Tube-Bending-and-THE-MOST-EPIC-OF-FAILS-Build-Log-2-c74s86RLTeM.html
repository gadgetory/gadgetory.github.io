all right so things look things well
different don't they actually a lot has
has changed since the last time we we
were here this is not where the pump was
last time or at least the reservoir
there was a reservoir that was just
right here on the NZXT bracket and it's
not there anymore because it was just
putting a little bit too much pressure
on the GPU and I was just afraid of what
kind of long-term effects that would
have on the graphics card so I decided
to remove it however the one that I had
the 150 light was too large to fit
anywhere else so I had to swap it out
for this pump right here this is the
this is actually a pump rez combo so it
makes things a little bit simpler for us
you can see I got I've got like this
little uh this little fan bracket here
radiator bracket so that it's gonna
mount sideways isn't that isn't that
special so this is sort of gives me a
better idea and what what I realized is
that I had gone through all this and
completely overlooks the drain valve I
was like alright my loop makes sense it
looks good oh crap how am I gonna drain
the system this is my not so elegant
solution so what I'm gonna do is
basically take this guy this is a
five-way divider splitter I should say
not a divider what a noob I am and
that's gonna go right here like so so
there's gonna be a hard tube connecting
they're bumping uglies and then I'm
gonna do soft tubing that's gonna go
from this thing right here connecting to
this fitting right here and then you can
see here I've also got some more soft
tubing that's just gonna go down and
there's the drain valve we'll see if it
works out you might have also noticed
that the fans gun I used to have a 120
millimeter Corsair airflow fan here but
I've since removed that because I've
realized I'm gonna need a little bit
more space I've liked a little bit more
room for the tubing here especially if
I'm sticking with the thicker 16
millimeter stuff but then it looks kind
of empty doesn't it so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna put in this little load
this flow valve indicator booms come go
right there towards the back it is UB
reactive so might look pretty cool with
our UV lights and also that brings me to
this point
fill in the loop first with the Mayhem's
Aurora blue this is the one that looks
like shampoo and jay told me that the
shampoo effect doesn't really last very
long if I don't like it I'll just take
it out immediately if I like it I'll
wait till the shampoo effect goes away
and then I will drain it and maybe put
something else in
and the next we've got more fan stuff so
you guys already saw me install tubes of
Corsair SP fans they've got two more
that's gonna go on the front radiator
it's gonna go on the right side of
course and then we've got our LED strips
we may or may not go with you B
depending because initially I was gonna
use the the fluid up there I had two
bottles of some UV fluid but since we're
not doing UV reactive fluid anymore I
might just go with a white a white LED
strip this is these are both from cable
mods so thanks kid blunt for hooking me
up a--they so we'll play around with it
dub we'll see what happens but those are
all the things that I wanted to save for
this very lengthy intro on that note I
am going to start to bending the tubes
you see I've got my bowl of bowl with
soapy water over there all the tubes
just getting ready to get bent saw I'm
sawing today yo cuz I'm a man
all right so I think we're halfway done
with the bend so I think we have two
more to go they are the longest ones in
fact we got this one going from the pump
to the video card and then we've got one
from the CPU back to the radiator at the
front you can see my drain valve back
there looking looking kind of weird kind
of funky it's a little it's a little
wacky but you know it's functional and
it sits in there the last tube that
we're doing the super long tube going
straight across it's gonna kind of steal
the show a little bit so it's gonna take
the foregrounds attention so I'm not too
worried about that I also wanted to
mention that the dudes over at unsourced
are hooking me up with some custom
extensions for this particular system so
I'm gonna be swapping out these white
extensions here with the unsourced ones
they are not here yet though so I'm
still gonna believe the system tonight
I'm going to try to at least
and once those cables arrive I will be
swapping them out which I should be able
to do even with all the tubing installed
I think I'll be able to access that as
long as the the RAM is the Rams removed
too because those frickin heat spreaders
bigger than
so this pipe right here it's actually
straight but it looks crooked the reason
why it looks crooked is because this
piece of stupid pump res is
actually sagging the sag is actually
causing the the tube to kind of go like
that at a slant stupid and it's not the
it's not the drain valve over there
that's that's weighing down the the pump
res this was actually already doing it
before I even installed that drain so
that's annoying anyone know like how I
could prop this up cuz look when you
prop it up poop the tubes perfectly
straight it's like parallel with the
video card as soon as you let it go
anyone have any good solutions for
propping this thing up and it's all
bolted down as much as it can be on
every single end so if anyone's got any
suggestions let me know
I'm an idiot and I feel stupider than I
usually do right now which is saying a
lot
look I'd okay did you just so I was so
excited to fill up the loop that I
completely forgot to plug up the two
quarter inch holes on the bottom of the
GPU waterblock
look they're just sitting right there I
completely forgot to screw them in and
luckily thank God that this PCIe cable
is the only thing that got really wet
everything else is perfectly dry maybe
except for the radiator here because we
get the power supply shroud thank god
that there's a power supply shroud here
otherwise the water would have just shot
straight out onto the power supply I
would have I would have died I would
have just totally died I don't I don't
even know what to say guys it's I'm I'm
just scared now of myself but I'm not
done I need to see this loop all
finished all running smoothly and we're
gonna do some drain testing or leak
testing overnight kind of looks like I
just did some leak testing right now and
that was a fail but let's just let's
fill the sleep up again or try to
all right so system is finally bled that
was kind of a struggle at first notably
mainly because of my der penis with the
the quarter-inch plugs here but you
might have also caught during that that
little montage that there was a leak
coming from the flow meter here as well
I actually had to swap out the stock
plug that it came with this guy sorry my
focus sucks had to replace this this
thing it was leaking was leaking all
over the place luckily nothing was
damaged or compromised but I had to
replace it with this this plug that came
from a Titan water block back in the day
so that's that's been working out so far
also the the actual propeller in here
wasn't spinning up when I first powered
the system on I was like oh crap I'm
gonna have to like open it up and fix
things but now I just had to give a
little tap gave a little tap at the
screwdriver and and up and out it went
about the coolant I I do like it but I
don't know if it's the right coolant for
this build I don't know I mean the
shampoo effect is nice and all it looks
really cool in the in the reservoir
there but I don't know I think I think
this just needs I think it needs to step
up a little bit more just to match the
insanity of those those heat spreaders
on the memory so I think what I'm gonna
do and this maybe I'll save this for the
next vlog but I'm gonna try bleeding the
system with this with this is the aqua
tuning stuff that I had initially
planned to go with which is UV reactive
and you can kind of see it is pretty UV
reactive however we're gonna intensify
that we're gonna try to intensify it a
little bit more with some Mayhem's UV
clear blue dye
sorry focus focus and and hopefully
it'll look even cooler because if you
look at this I just this is just regular
tap water and I put a couple drops of
that stuff in here and it's a lot more
vibrant than then the aqua tuning stuff
is by itself so I think the combination
of these two things is really going to
make the system pop with that UV light
maybe I'll get a second UV strip in here
just to intensify the effect I feel like
it could be a little brighter but who
knows also this is the morning-after
the builds I went to bed it was like
3:00 in the morning but I did not leave
it leak testing overnight just because
after the to various leaks that we had
here I was just too paranoid to leave it
unattended so I just turned it on about
an hour ago and there's no leaks at all
obviously a one-hour leak test is
probably not so quick I'll be doing some
more testing later today but so far it
is super dry and I'm pretty happy with
how it's turning out so far so we have
one more build log to go I believe which
is going to include the the new cables
from end sourced and I have to finish
wiring some of like the front panel
connectors those aren't even installed
yet and then and then the fluid fluids
gonna go in there and who knows who
knows what else maybe I'll do some other
wacky stuff less and final thing I
wanted to say is that I this is how I'm
temporarily solving the the saggy
pump res issue I've just got another I
just cut a piece of tubing that I'm
using kind of as a kickstand and it is
straightening straightening it out quite
a bit and the the run the run look at
the run actually I had to redo this run
remember before I was like it's not the
runs fault it's the pumps fault well the
pump was still crap but my run was also
bad so I just redid the run and now it's
like super straight I'm pretty happy
with how all the runs turned out like
especially these really tight ones and
even like the little one up there it's
cute the one run that I might redo I
don't know you guys let me know and
maybe it's hard to tell on camera but is
the the long one the long one right here
I mean I think it's I think it's good
enough it's passable but if I really
look at it I'm like well maybe it could
have been a little bit maybe just a
little bit straighter here I don't know
I could be imagining things to you let
me know but let me know what you guys
think of this build in the comments so
far if you think I'm doing it right or
not
Oh before before I close everything out
let me turn the lights off so you can
just get a better idea of the UV effects
alright so that's what it looks like
right now it's definitely some more pop
äj-- of that flow meter and this is the
the Aqua Tunis stuff and then this is
the the Mayhem's see how much brighter
the mayhem stuff is like I want that I
want I want that level of ridiculousness
so we're gonna we're gonna have to mix
the two and see what we get
hopefully there's no like really bad
reaction will be I'll be unfortunate if
there is but that is gonna wrap it up
for now guys
sure to like the video if you enjoyed it
let me know what you think of this
system so far in the comments below if
you have any other suggestions moving
forward and have a great rest of your
day I will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
