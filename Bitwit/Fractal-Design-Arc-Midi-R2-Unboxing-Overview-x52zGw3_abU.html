with awesomesauce news today I will be
taking a look at fractal designs our
committee are two mid tower computer
case it is a full ATX chassis in a
smaller form factor size but essentially
many of you might already be familiar
with the art committee that was released
in months prior and if you are aware of
that case you know what a great success
it was well essentially fractal design
has just gone back in made some minor
tweaks and adjustments or improvements I
should say hence the AR 2 model that I
have with me here today so with that
said why don't i unbox this guy and
let's have a closer look alright so
taking a look at the front of the case I
first off I just will say that this case
is mainly made of metal it's very sturdy
it's got a very solid construction but
the front bezel right here is actually
made of plastic and to be honest you
really wouldn't even know it unless you
reached out and touched it because even
though it's hard to tell right now on
video it's it's even hard to tell in
person that it's not aluminum because it
does kind of have a nice very nice fo
brushed aluminum finish but when you
touch it pick it up and stuff it is
actually in fact plastic but it's a very
sturdy plastic I'm not too worried about
it there are 25 and a quarter inch base
and just beneath those is a metallic
mesh grille it's basically covering the
lower half of the chassis you can see a
fractal design logo at the bottom right
there with the previous our committee
they actually had the fractal logo up
top and it was kind of engraved into the
chassis itself and I didn't really like
it because it just it blended in a
little bit too much with the chassis and
it just looked way too black everything
was just completely blacked out and I
really like what they've done here
especially because it's got some silver
accents and it really stands out in
front of that black front panel now you
can actually remove this metallic grill
and it's essentially a removable dust
filter so to do that you basically just
apply some pressure at the top two
corners of that grill pops off very
easily you can even see some foam on the
other side and that's just
it helps reduce some of the noise
produced by your fans from within your
chassis which speaking of which they've
given you a one hundred forty millimeter
fan it's one of those silent series are
two fans it's painted white but
essentially you can also amount a second
one hundred and forty millimeter fan
just beneath that and if you wanted to
you could even mount 2 120's here you
just obviously take out that 140 if you
want to pop off the front bezel
completely simply stick your hand
underneath there and give it a nice tug
it'll pop off relatively easily there's
another look at the fan on the opposite
side and up top you can see your i/o
panel now there are two screws on either
side of that IO panel which if you
remove you can actually remove that IO
panel completely if you want to tweak or
mod it or you just need to replace it
it's very convenient and easy to do
speaking of I oh you've got a reset
button a mic and headphone jack power
button as well as some activity light
leds you've got two USB 3 ports whereas
on the original our committee you only
had one USB 3.0 port and two USB two
points I would much rather have the two
three point O ports and ditch the single
two point O port and lastly on the right
there you've got a three level
integrated fan controller also along the
top you've got another metallic mesh
grille and this is also removable but in
a different way than what we saw on the
front there's actually two thumb screws
at the back of the case you got to
remove those and then you can basically
pop off that entire top panel and that's
going to reveal another included one
hundred and forty millimeter fan and
also a crap ton of mounting points for
other fans so you can mount either 31
40s or 31 20s here and if you'll notice
the mounting points for the 120
millimeter fans are actually off-center
there they're actually veered away from
the right side of the case and the
purpose of that is basically so you can
install a fat 240 radiator and not run
into any clearance issues from your
motherboard or your memory on the left
side is a tinted window on your side
panel which i think is pretty cool
because if you're rocking some really
bright LEDs in your case and let's say
you don't have connected to a controller
and they're pretty much just stuck being
really bright it can be kind of
distracting if you're watching a movie
or gaming in the dark for example it's
kind of nice to have that tinted window
actually if that's your situation on the
opposite side is just another basic all
metal side panel and that brings us to
the back with
your last included one hundred and forty
millimeter fan once again mounting
points for a hundred and twenty
millimeter fan there's your knockout for
your motherboard shield seven expansion
slots plus one little floater on the
side there if you've used all of your
seven expansion slots and let's say you
just want some additional i/o
connectivity put a bracket adapter there
for example you can do so on the bottom
you've got your power supply mount and
on the very bottom you have another
removable dust filter right under your
power supply now moving on to the right
side interior of this chassis first off
we can see there's a fairly large cutout
for your CPU cooler and just a ton of
room for cable management here guys
there's about an inch from your
motherboard tray to where your side
panel closes so you should have no
problem fitting all your cables on this
side of the chassis even if you're not
rocking a modular power supply and even
to help you with the cable management
further there's a ton of rubber grommets
and tie down points just to keep them
all nice and tidy there's also two
mounting points for ssds which you can
mount right here on the motherboard tray
which I guess is a nice feature if
you're going for kind of a stealth vibe
but other than that it's kind of
inconvenient because if you ever want to
remove those SSDs you'd have to
uninstall your entire motherboard along
with it so unless you're looking for a
long-term solution I might advise to
stay away from this or at least think
twice before you mount them here there's
a look at your business end of the drive
cages and up Todd you've got some cables
for your fan controller at the front I
oh so there's your 4-pin molex power
connector and you can actually connect
up to three fans to this controller so
here are three two pin fan connectors
and finally that brings us to the left
side interior the case where all the
magic happens so first off we've got a
fully black painted interior so aside
from the few white accents as you can
see the PCI slots as well as the fans as
well as the drive trays it's this black
and white thing that freckles gone with
him they're sticking with it and I
really like it because it matches with a
lot of stuff and personally I'm going to
tease you guys a little bit I'm actually
planning a build inside of this chassis
it's coming up very soon you guys should
be very excited let's move on to the
rolled steel edges along the the case so
it's very nice you don't cut yourself
it's a nice touch it's very attention to
detail oriented and you've also got to
drive cages here one on top which fits
five drives and you've got a bottom one
which fits three which allows you to
mount up
eight two and a half inch or three and a
half inch drives in these white metallic
drive trays which aren't very flexible
they're very sturdy in fact and you
probably heard somebody in the head with
this but they also feature rubber
grommets on them to reduce noise and
vibration from your drives the top cage
can be rotated clockwise 90 degrees or
you can be removed completely to fit
longer graphics cards or just to open up
some more airflow in your case if you
remove the drive cage by the way the top
one you can just fit any graphics card
ever like there's just a ton of room the
bottom cage can also be removed but you
can also mount it off to the left side a
little bit if you want to actually make
room for a full 240 millimeter radiator
at the front of this case and if you're
dealing with an extra thick radiator or
you just need some more room for a
push-pull for example you can even slide
this bottom cage over even more to the
left side to accommodate those
configurations on the bottom of your
chassis there's a mounting point for
either a 120 or 140 millimeter fan
that's essentially right beneath where
your video card sits so it's directing
air straight to your GPU at the back you
have your power supply mount and there
are four little foam risers that come up
just a bit for your power supply to
actually sit on and that's essentially
just there to help suppress some more
noise and vibration front panel
connectors of course power reset LEDs
you've got HD audio and your USB 3.0
header don't worry if you don't have a
USB 3 0 point 0 header on your
motherboard you can still take advantage
of the two USB 3.0 ports at the front of
your case they've included a USB to
point out connector here you would just
have to revert to USB 2.0 speeds here's
a better look at the included one
hundred and forty millimeter fans at the
top and rear of your case and I almost
forgot to mention that all of these fans
come with very nicely black sleeved
cables alright guys and girls that is
going to wrap it up for this unboxing
and overview once again this has been
fractal designs our committee are two
mid tower computer case and as i said
earlier in this video i am planning a
pretty sweet rig inside of this chassis
very very soon and without giving too
much away i will say that it is going to
be an epic gaming rig that's all i'm
going to give away from now you're gonna
have to stay tuned later to find out
what happens next in that video but yeah
leave your thoughts about this case in
the comment section below you guys know
the drill like and subscribe if
already and until next time I'll see you
all in the next video it's even better
than it was and some of the adjustments
some of the changes are pretty cool so
I'm gonna take a look in there and then
what we'll do the thing we'll just do
thing alright see ya guys seriously you
stop messing around today mmm today I'm
gonna take a look at the are too they
made some minor but my left them deck
which others in through a remix better
than that little Brad where we could we
get</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
