on the link below for more info alright
so today is the day that the r-tx 2080
launched that's when i'm filming this
video is it's the same day that all the
performance or review embargo is lifted
it's the same day that you saw all of
the r-tx videos surface on youtube
finally and the reason why I'm making
this video is because I want to sort of
revisit one of the benchmarks slides
that was in my own review video and that
was the frames per dollar slide the
frames per dollar slide basically gives
us an at-a-glance look at the sort of
value proposition of each of the cards
that I tested including the r-tx 2080
the r-tx 20 atti and i think for other
cards there so the reason why this needs
an update is because there are now
prices actual prices that we can see on
on retailer websites for the r-tx cards
where previously when I was making my
review I didn't really have anything to
base the pricing off of other than the
MSRP s that were officially given to me
and other reviewers by Nvidia and so you
can see here this is the actual the the
same exact slide apart from the the
green that I sort of highlighted the
r-tx cards in here this is the exact
same slide that was in my review video
you can see I've got the dollar amounts
next to each of the cards and these are
actually the best some of the best
prices that I could find for custom
versions of each of these cards the
reason why I used pricing from the
custom cards is because I wanted to be
as realistic as possible and I figured
most people going out to buy a GTX 10
series card or even an rx Vega card
they're not gonna settle for a Founders
edition card they're probably gonna go
for a custom board partner car that has
a better cooler on it maybe better power
delivery factory overclocks and things
like that so so I wanted it to be more
realistic and representative of what the
average consumer is going to be looking
at if considering purchasing one of
these cards now there's sort of an issue
here because we're using the pricing for
the custom cards but we're using the
performance of the founders edition
reference cards at the same time so that
does definitely throw things off really
I think it's safe to assume that the
values we see here for our GTX 10 series
cards and our eggs mega64 card
I think these values are a little bit
low they're kind of doing these cards
into service and in reality if we were
pairing or calculating these numbers
with the admin board partner custom
variant performance then I think these
figures would be slightly higher I don't
think that would change the values here
significantly in fact I'm pretty sure
the rankings would stay the same overall
but what's interesting is I kind of gave
the r-tx cards the benefit of the doubt
on this slide mainly because I
calculated their frames per dollar using
the official starting price of $6.99 for
the 2080 and 999 for the 2080 TI which
we all know now on launch day that you
cannot find an RT x 2080 for $6.99 so it
just stands to reason that if I'm using
the current pricing that can be found
today for all the other cards I should
use the current pricing that can be
found today for the RT x 2080 as well
the RT x 28 ET I kind of had a weird
semi launch today because while you can
see them on Newegg and Amazon stuff you
can't actually buy them since Nvidia
delayed their general availability by
about a week so we're mainly focusing on
the RT X 2080 right now needless to say
this graph needs to be updated with the
current pricing so why don't we go ahead
and do that now we'll head to newegg.com
I did find some RT X 20 80s and even a
20 80 TI or two on Amazon but all the
pricing there was about 20 to 30 dollars
higher overall so we're just gonna stick
to nuoc here looking for the lowest
possible prices now the RT x 2080 from
ZOTAC one of those otech gaming cards is
actually 749 that's not bad
$50 over the starting price but then
again this is a closed shroud with a
blower fan it's gonna be really noisy
and probably hot so I don't think this
is representative of what most consumers
are looking at if they're gonna be
purchasing this card so I'm gonna go to
the next one the RT x 28 EXC gaming from
EVGA at $7.99 that sounds a bit more
reasonable not in terms of price but
just the type of card gamers are looking
for so this is $100 premium over the
starting price so that's definitely
gonna change our frames per dollar value
I should mention that I saw a custom RT
X 2080 here on Newegg earlier
this morning for 789 so I actually used
that dollar amount to calculate the new
frames per dollar value for the r-tx
2080 so bear that in mind still it's
only a ten dollar difference but that's
kind of what we're looking at right now
for the r-tx 2080 on launch day if
you're looking for a custom variant that
isn't gonna get all hot and loud so
let's move on to the let's actually take
a quick pit stop here at the GTX 1080p
eye because the 1080i is very
competitive right now with the RT X 2080
or at least it was in my first FPD slide
if we take a look at that you can see
the 2080 and 1080 TI are the most
neck-and-neck when it comes to their
frames per dollar value compared to the
other cards in the bunch but like we
just saw the 2080 is not selling for
$6.99 right now but rather 789 so this
will have to be adjusted and let's take
a look at the 1080 Ti going back here
you can see I've also sorted this by
lowest price and these are refurbished
and they don't matter here
6:49 for the msi gtx 980ti duke 11 gig
OC so this is actually a pretty decent
card and it's got a nice cooler on a
triple fan heatsink design a very well
reviewed card as well people seem to
like it premium features backplate and
all that sort of thing
so this is a card that I could see
gamers being interested in especially
for a relatively attractive price here
so this is the figure that we're gonna
use for the updated frames per dollar
slide 649 not $6.99 like we previously
had last but certainly not least we have
to take a look at the pricing for our
r-tx 20 atti at eleven hundred and sixty
nine ninety nine once again it says
otech card this time it's a triple fan
design so it looks like it's a pretty
respectable cooler and could be quite
popular if if it is gonna stay as the
lowest priced r-tx 2080 TI for now so
this is again significantly higher than
the starting price that nvidia told us
custom cards would start at or that's
redundant of $9.99 this is a hundred and
seventy dollars over that so again we're
gonna have to adjust our frames per
dollar slide so taking all that into
account this is the old slide that was
revealed during my review video and this
is our now
launched a slide with the updated
pricing for all the cards and what do
you know the r-tx 2080 has actually
fallen to the bottom to join the r-tx 20
atti as the two lowest ranked cards on
this list in terms of their frames per
dollar or their price to performance
they are clearly the worst bang for the
buck right now because of the inflated
launch prices and this is something that
I should have seen coming but there was
no way I could have predicted the
pricing here of 789 and 1169 until today
so that's why we're sort of doing this
follow-up video now and you can see here
two gtx 1070 and GT x 1080 are still
ahead by a long shot
and suddenly the gtx 1080 TI looks like
a much better value proposition at 3.19
FBD compared to the RT x 2080 which is
now significantly more expensive at two
point seven seven by the way I was able
to find an RX Vega 64 for just $4.99
quite a bit cheaper than what I was
seeing when I was conducting my review
earlier this week I believe it was a
sapphire nitro card very decent looking
card nice-looking cooler on it and that
obviously pushed our FPD up to three
point one three taking it above the r-tx
2080 this time around but still
evidently falling quite short of the GTX
1080 and all the other GTX 10 series
cards for that matter now at the end of
the day what this means is that if you
only care about raw performance you just
want all the frames you could care less
about r-tx you know ray-tracing DL SS
and you have about six to eight hundred
dollars to spend meaning you could
either choose realistically between the
1080 Ti or the 2080
I think this chart kind of says it all I
mean you do get anywhere from five to
ten percent faster performance on the
2080 than you do on the 1080i but you're
paying a hundred and one hundred and
forty dollars more for that very
incremental increase so what kind of
conclusions can we draw now from this
updated slide well for starters I think
the gtx 980ti is now painted in a much
better light compared to the RT x 2080
because it's just got a better bang for
the buck overall if you're looking at
this chart now of course you can look at
a different chart where the r-tx 2080 is
ahead of the 1080 TI and that would just
be a performance chart because it is the
faster card it's about five
10% faster on average that means it
could be less than 5% or more than 10%
faster in certain games but on average
in my testing at 1440p and 4k if you're
taking the average frame rates it's
about 5 to 10 percent faster than the
1080 TI that being said it's 140 dollars
more expensive right now so I I don't
think I don't think that's worth it
the only other considerable thing that
the RT X 2080 has going forward here is
the RT X technology that that's suite of
technologies including ray tracing and
DL SS if those are important to you if
you are really set on experiencing those
firsthand as they come into the market
as they hit the industry for the first
time you want to feel it and see and
experience it in its infancy and you
just can't wait for it to become sort of
this mainstream technology that trickles
down to all of us plebs then maybe that
$140 premium is worth it to you and
there's absolutely nothing wrong with
that it's your money you can spend it
however you want and for the record I I
think the r-tx 2080 and 2080 TI are
fantastic cards it's just unfortunate
that every new GPU that seems to come
out just gets hit with ridiculously
inflated launch prices and that really
dampens their overall value and it makes
them hard to recommend it makes them a
hard sell so until the prices go down on
these RT x cards i can't say just like
go out and buy it you know you know
obviously it's your money do what you
want but I personally wouldn't I would
wait for those prices to come down and
even when they do like if the RT X 2080
in three months you know but let's say
by the end of the year the RT X 2080
drops down to its starting price for
like that EVGA XC card for example a
nice custom cooler card down to $6.99
what's the 1080 TI gonna be at that
point is that gonna also drop you know
relative to that there is it gonna be
now you know you can have it for five
hundred and seventy bucks cuz if so it's
still a really good deal might want to
think about that too so it's it's a
numbers game it's it's a pricing thing
and it's therefore gonna be fluctuating
all over the place for the next couple
months and we'll just have to wait and
see maybe I'll do another follow-up
video in
whenever that happens so that's all I
got for now guys though y'all let me
