channel hope you're all doing well today
we're taking a look at something a
little bit different from the folks over
at cable mod these are their mod wrap
ãão sleeping kits which are compatible
with select corsair envy xt and EBG a
liquid a iOS we're going to be mod
wrapping our h 100 ib2 here from Corsair
cable mods actually sent me sleeping
kids for both Corsair NZXT
the EVGA ones were evidently not ready
yet but we only need the corsair ones
for today in order to show you guys
exactly how this works what the
materials are made of what it comes
included with and overall what it looks
like in the end result these kits are
mainly aimed at users who are looking to
upgrade the appearance of their rig
obviously there's no performance
improvements with by using one of these
but if you are trying to make your
system stand out amongst the crowd by
doing something a little bit different
than this product maybe something you're
interested in so without saying too much
more why don't we just go ahead and dive
right in and take a look at how this all
works all right
so tap it into this bag here mind you
I'm guessing this is not the retail
packaging so rest assured yours will
probably look a little bit nicer when it
arrives here we have some plastic clips
that are used to actually cinch down the
sleeving onto your AIO tube so they
don't go anywhere we'll see how those
work in just a bit and we've got several
different colors here looks like we've
got white red blue black and green I'm
not exactly sure if these are all the
colors that are offered or if cable mod
might release new colors in the future
but these definitely seem to be some of
the more popular ones that are used in
the PC DIY community today so I think
we're going to go with the green no I
don't like green I'm going to go with
screen okay bright and fun bright and
fun wins
thank you wifey sauce for the input just
work the camera just do your job
damnit okay you're right I love all
right so then let's open up the cooler
here give me a minute to get this guy
already alright so first off I should
mention that we've got sort of this
nylon material for these sleeves and
it's a really nice material actually
very similar to what you'd find on the
Mod mesh cables from cable mod you can
expect the same level of quality and
material being used which is nice and
you can see that the h100 ivy
- here is definitely one of the
compatible a iOS for these kits because
the length of the tubing is just
absolutely perfect doesn't look like you
have to do any sort of trimming of the
sleeving itself in any way so that's
really nice and we're just going to open
it up we're going to open up the
sleeving like so and just sort of put
the tubing one of the tubes in there to
start just like that and if you run your
finger down the sleeve and sort of wrap
it around the tube you can see this
leaving kind of takes over it's got a
mind of its own and finally finish it
off like that you can always adjust the
tubing the sleeve a little bit to make
sure that it's in the appropriate
position and look at that it's like the
perfect length again note no trimming or
modifying the thus leaving at all so now
we're going to take two halves of the
clips and we're going to secure one end
of the sleeve in here and that's nearest
to the radiator and it takes a little
bit of finesse to actually get these
Clips interlocked the reps of cable mod
have have mentioned that the reason why
they went with these clips is because
these ones look a lot nicer the other
the other clips are easier to use but
they kind of have like an overlapping
plastic latch which does not look very
easy on the eyes so they went with
aesthetics which i think is a good call
because once you get these installed you
pretty much don't have to worry about
them or service them much at all after
that so there we go all right one down
and it looks pretty flush with the the
fitting on the radiator here you almost
wouldn't notice that there's a an
aftermarket plastic clip holding the
sleeving in place I'm going to put the
other one on now
I should be really good at putting these
clips on by the end of this video
alright second clip of the first tube
has been installed
I'll admit that these clips aren't the
easiest to get on it did take a little
bit of force in order to get them on but
once you do they seem super secure so
even if you have like some really
extreme bending that you have to do in
your case you can rest assured that the
tubing is not going to go anywhere not
going to slip down part of the or I
should say this leaving is not going to
go anywhere it won't
off of the tubing in anyway all right
sleeping job is complete let's go ahead
and install this guy into a working
system so we can see what the finished
product looks like all right guys here
it is feast your eyes on the finished
product it actually looks pretty good
better than I thought it would actually
installation of course was pretty
straightforward you don't even really
need the user's manual and once it's all
set up it looks good like it looks good
standing alone of course it's a matter
of preference I think it looks good but
if you can manage to pair other elements
in your system of the same color as the
sleeving itself for example I have a gtx
1070 founders edition with a nice green
LED on the side of the card then
everything looks really matchy-matchy
and can actually upgrade the overall
aesthetic of your rig so if that's what
you're into go ahead and follow the link
in the description below and you can
find out more about these mod wraps
leaving kits from good old cable month
that's going to do it for now guys thank
you so much for watching be sure to stay
tuned for more tech stuff coming at you
really soon and I will see y'all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
