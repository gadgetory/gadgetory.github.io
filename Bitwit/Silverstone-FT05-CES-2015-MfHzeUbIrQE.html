2015 is brought to you by WD
so
alright guys so now we're here chillin
at the silverstone booth I'm talking to
Michael and we've decided to sit down
because lord knows our feet are just
tired by this point right so this is the
ft 05 or the fortress 5 and it's Polly
ATX case correct yes it's a full-size
ATX case with this guy it's actually one
of our more unique designs because with
this if you know Silverstone cases at
all you know that our products are
trying to be as unique and innovative as
possible and one of the ways that we
really grab market attention initially
is by having the patent for the 90
degree motherboard rotation so that was
really the key concept that we have with
us as well it's really built off the
idea of cooling so on the bottom of the
case you have these two 180 millimeter
fans those fans not only point at the
actual GPU itself from the power supply
but they'll also point at the cpu cooler
for example in my case you can see i
have our big h co 2 inside of here but
there's not even a fan on the cooler
itself it's just using the case fans and
on top of that like you've mentioned we
also put sound dampening foam on the
inside of it not only on the walls but
even on the bottom of it so normally
with this model there's a it actually
includes a 3.5 inch drive cage on here
currently I take it I took it off so we
could have a larger power supply so
that's kind of not on this case right
now but it doesn't come included
standard and behind them other board we
also have additional housing for 2 2.5
inch drives and the only other thing
that you'll notice on is that
unfortunately there's no 5 on a quarter
inch base and who cares so what we did
in order to address that is we actually
included on the very front of the case
you can see there's a slimline otd when
is it coming out or can we buy this
right now so this is actually currently
available in the market you can buy it
right now amazon newegg a lot of
different resellers have it available
MSRP is about 185 right now we're always
doing promotions on it so you can just
take a look on the marketplace and see
what you can get it for awesome well
thank you Michael for talking to us
today enjoy the rest of time to yes
alright guys have made my way over to
the a dated booth I'm talking to Thomas
and we're just checking out some SSD
some m2 drives some really cool stuff
here Thomas before we get started though
I was just curious would you be willing
to provide any review samples for m dot
to SSDs in the future I'm sure I could
make it happen awesome well on that note
thank you very much for talking to us
today and have a good rest of your time
