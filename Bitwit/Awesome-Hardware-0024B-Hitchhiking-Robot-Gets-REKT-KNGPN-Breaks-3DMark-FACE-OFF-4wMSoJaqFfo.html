God that it was it's the hdmi it's that
damn many hdmi cable I swear to God if
it craps out on me I'm gonna lose my
show we're fine okay but I everything's
fine we're streaming now guys are we
coming through can you see our faces can
you hear our voices how many fingers am
i holding huh I see at least how many
fingers six that's impossible I had one
hand all right hello guys welcome back
to awesome hardware this is part 2 or
side B of the show if you missed part
one and you're watching the reupload go
ahead and head over to paul's hardware
and watch side a we had a fantabulous
first half of the show and then we're
going to have another fantabulous half
of the second part that we have here
paul is tweeting to make sure that
everyone knows that we are streaming
alive if you're watching us live thank
you for continuing to watch us in chat
and we have some good announcements
first off by some shirts buy some shirts
by some mugs from Paul Paul's hardware
earth is there's a new benefit to buying
shirts there is a new benefit and I was
getting to that so if you happen to buy
something from Paul and my own store
awesomesauce network.com slash store you
will actually get a voucher of sorts or
some cash back for fresher mic is muted
that's impossible no that makes that
meted that's you're wrong you're all
wrong now we're not made it no muted
yeah it looks fine so if you happen to
buy merchandise from either of our
stores at the same time you'll actually
get some cash back because you'll save
some money on shipping basically because
Paul and I both go through the same
vendor for all of our merchandise you
will actually not have to pay double
shipping when ordering both of our stuff
simultaneously so that's just knew thats
that's a new thing that starts today and
so yeah so basically what we're saying
is you should buy it started from both
of us he actually started last week so
that's the first time we're announcing
there's some folks who ordered stuff
last week and I he went and issued them
retroactive refunds but yes it was great
of him to do yes he just like hit us up
until it's like hey most people people
have been ordering for both of your
stores and it doesn't
since like ship them separately and yard
room separately so this is awkward need
a by John so John a huge thanks to you
for doing that a Johnson for John
Johnson for John hey yeah man all right
are people hearing us by the way I we're
us we have some people saying that the
audio is not okay but then other people
assume that the audio is fine and
someone else said that thumb screw is
wrong shut up you're fine now that's
back its back Oh God back I'm not gonna
touch it I'm not touching it I'm not
touching it i'm attacking it back by now
this is this is just how the show goes
gosh this is part of the fun this is
part of why you watch us it's not for
the Polish it's for the raw miss of it
all all right what Linus did not hack
our channel right everyone it's a lie
everyone stay calm everyone keep calm
and and and and chill and I think we're
a chill the F out ever i see i see
levels okay we're good we're good the
kid cameras working ok so again with the
announcements if you didn't hear from
the earlier part we are now doing
combined shipping so if you happen to
buy something from my store and paul
store you'll actually save some money on
shipping you want to pay shipping twice
for the two separate orders which is
awesome you get it as a refund as well
we should point that you get as a refund
place each order separately and then he
will just recognize its good order both
of the exact same time yeah he'll
recognize both are going to the same
place so box them together and then you
get like a 250 refund afterward from
each of us yes also within the
announcements i'm getting married on
friday it's tuesday I'm getting married
in like Wednesday Thursday I'm getting
married in three days that's insane
which is nuts crazy I can't I don't even
know why I'm here right now I shouldn't
be doing the show my fianc√©'s out there
just like just scolding she's like
waiting for me to like walk out so she
can punch me in the face for working
today she watching the show no she's not
she's cooking dinner which is also very
very good very nice of her so yeah
because of that we won't be doing an
after party tonight Paul and I will
happy gaming I've obviously got a ton of
stuff to do for the wedding and Paul's
probably goes on an agenda
I'm exciting things keep lying my
channel yes tomorrow there you go
there's some good stuff coming tomorrow
we can't reveal too much else oven that
but apart from that I think also I
wanted to give you guys a heads up my
followers if you watch my last video you
know that I'm kind of on the rocks this
weekend next week because of my wedding
and the honeymoon but in case you didn't
catch that part I just wanted to say
that I will probably only be posting one
video this week in one video next week
instead of my regular to I try to do two
videos a week same with you I'm sure
probably gonna be one video a week but
hopefully it'll be fun your kinda girl
you're kind to warn people when you're
only in a post one video I'm usually
just like I only have one of you this is
you it is what it is yeah get much that
it is what she and assume it so yeah um
thank you guys for hanging in there and
let's just get right down to it shall we
so the first segment that I have today
is tech news of course as always and the
first bit of news that I'd like to share
with you guys is the the three world
records that have been set in 3dmark
okay by the the the famous King been
waiting for me to bring the story up yes
I was doing I was doing the Lord's there
of course it said you have a lot of work
to do over there so kingpin is a very
famous overclocker he set many World
Records and he just set three more in
3dmark a very popular benchmarking tool
the card he did it with was his very own
of edition of the gtx 980 TI from EG
EVGA okay so it'll be weird if he did it
with like someone else's card yeah right
like the OC cookie card yeah or
something like that but my cooking yeah
the hi cookie there you go EVGA has
released their 980 TI kingpin edition
card which is just a beast of a car they
released it probably a week or two ago
and within that week of releasing it
kingpin had set three World Records in
3dmark fire strike fire strike fire
strike extreme and fire strike ultra
this is a single GPU with a single GPU
using a 59 60 X on the exciter 9 24 25
thousand
233 and fire strike yes there were you
about to say all these things yes are
you can go ahead Kyle that's okay this
is kyle's have the show I'm just gonna
drink thank you for taking over I mean
it's nice it's nice i'm gonna do
anything see you didn't choose okay
cheers Cheers thanks tell you guys for
being hey all right so yes as Paul was
saying three fire three mark fire strike
he got 20 5233 this is often these all
these tests all these records that he
broke were with a single card the
kingpin edition 980 TI three mark fire
strike xtreme at 13,000 and 91 and
actually right before the show I just
happened to benchmark my own 980 TI
reference card with a 58 20k mind you
but still should be similar right but no
it wasn't it was actually the result I
got was 7,000 487 again compared that to
his 13,000 and 91 and now granted i'm
i'm on a i'm using an h100i gtx and he's
using Ellen to what frequency was he
running it so the max frequency that he
hit out of all these tests was eighteen
hundred and ninety-seven megahertz
pretty impressive it's pretty nuts
consider that the base clock of this
card is twelve hundred and three
megahertz I've so he's taking it up six
gigahertz I found from that pen finally
done some testing with my seven
gigahertz 1980s this this past week oh
its Arctic panther ah yeah I I wanted to
get to 1550 but and I maybe could but i
would need to do a lot more I think
tweaking yeah I'm sure I'm trying to
look for something comfortable then I'm
in about fifteen forty 1545 yeah I can
get pretty stable what are your attempts
at that I've been a GPUs they're fine my
gpu's get in the 50s my CMU hits 60 65
nice but I had my CP is so so nice on
that system it's it's almost unfair like
because I'm not like 1.2 volts yeah i'm
at 4.5 with an eight-core 59 60 x that's
awesome so it's like I I should push the
59 60 X further right I've done all this
testing with it a four-point gigahertz
and I'm like
that would actually have you push it I
have pushed it already when she first
got it I Trish and I got the 475 pretty
easy okay I mean pretty state I was
stable 475 I couldn't get to 48 and that
was still off of 1.2 yes I probably was
using more voltage than because I was
before I had voltage tuned it to try to
see how low I could go into voltage but
right who knows nice so again
congratulations to King pen for setting
those World Records definitely not an
easy task and congratulations to EVGA
for making a kick-ass card the guys are
if you guys haven't heard too much about
the kingpin edition of their 980 TI
again base clock of twelve hundred and
three megahertz boost clock of 1300 and
for six gigs of gddr5 which is same as
the reference 980 TI with a memory clock
of 7010 megahertz or 7090 six megahertz
if you're in OC mode it's got triple
bios's it's by Oh Sees whatever it's
using the AC X 2 point 0 cooler which
this one actually features a 14 plus
three phase power design if you can't
call it the AC X 2 point 0 cooler still
because this this cooler is so much
different it is what it is materials
especially I think it's just the
materials though that's different
because instead of having an aluminum
heatsink as well as copper heatpipes
though everything's covered the few
types and the entire heatsink is copper
so which is gonna dissipate a lot more
heat if you guys are interested in more
information on this card I don't think
he has posted a video yet but I know he
has one Jay Jay Jay's got one I saw was
Instagram post and I know he's going to
be doing a video on it so Jays two cents
check that out and I know hope you don't
give it a once-over into benchmarks in
fact if you're watching us right now go
ahead and blow up Jays twitter with
hashtag show me the copper show me the
copper yeah show me the copper blow it
up right now that'll be exciting I want
his phone to break it's a nice card it
is a really nice card and and it's been
so long since I've seen actual copper
fins on a heat sink mm-hmm for something
like that another another interesting
thing I want to say about this this
edition of card from EVGA is that I
honestly haven't seen a card like this
where it's been offered in different
prices based on the way it's been bent
so all the all the cards all the 980 TI
kingpin edition
from EVGA have been prebend but you can
actually select as a consumer you can
select the GPU what is it the ASI sea is
a si si ASIC is an application-specific
integrated search yes the ASIC which is
basically in layman's terms the
overclocking performance how binned is
this GPU so you based on that it'll
actually affect the price that you pay
for it so the the actual price of the
card can range from 852 a thousand 50
USD based on you know the overclocking
performance you want to get out of it so
I thought that was pretty interesting so
there's two ways to look at that one is
to look at it like oh if you really want
that highest possible Bend GPU then you
can pay for it which you couldn't really
do before usually you would pay for like
you get a kingpin card all of them would
overclock really well because they're
all been GPUs but like the best ones is
still going to be hit or miss just roll
the dice the other way you could look at
is like well EVGA is making more money
now on those top bins yes which makes
more sense for them yes it does so I'm
okay with it I'm okay cuz cuz people
will pay for those tops on GPUs and
people who like want to be able to say
like yeah my my 980 TI is running it's
1900 megahertz right like 24 7 yeah like
something like that yeah okay so and you
know obviously it takes more work on
EVGA zend to to do that to kind of
separate the bin CP GPUs to see which
ones you know how they rank on the whole
scale or whatever try to categorize them
and price them that's a lot more work in
time and money for EVGA so I understand
why the additional price is there but
again congrats on the the World Records
kingpin nice next up is a story that
Paul kind of alluded to earlier on his
half of the show today which was the
hitch height hitchhiking robot that gets
totally wrecked by some anonymous US
citizens or assailants Paul kind of
staged this story as like a victory for
America are you talking to like over to
like overthrow the robot race or
whatever and likely we were having a
robot invasion which is completely
untrue this was a completely innocent
robot who was built and crafted to
hitchhike based on the moral values of
American citizens my head people in
general my headline was robot invasion
thwarted and that's completely just
totally legit you should write for The
Onion cuz that's a total joke right
there alright so there's there's this
hitchhiking robot he's adorable I don't
know if he's got a name but his name is
hitchbot basically but yeah and he's
traveled across several several
countries including Canada he was
actually made in Canada by Canadian
researchers and Germany and the
Netherlands all these different
countries and he was able to rely on the
generosity of strangers to get him from
A to B people would like seem on the
side of the road and be like give me a
ride and they would put him in his car
and take him to a certain location and
drop him off and he would then again
wait for another stranger to pick him up
and take him elsewhere um but it was
only about two weeks upon entering the
United States like his when our poor
hitchbot was decapitated and left dead
on the side of a road his US tour is so
sad it's like so short right like you
look at the Canadian tour of hitchbot
and it's like I went all over here we
went all the way across the Canadian
border I mean like America it's like
some Canadians fry like upgraded him
along the way like scrubbed off all oh
yeah everything they shine him up he
looked like r2d2 at the end of every
it's not even like let's do something
constructive and likes you know like
tear parts off of it to sell or
something like so look at that
hitchhiking robot look crap out
of it and interior carriage pieces
because that's that's my parent Lee
entertainment that's the country we live
in folks I mean clearly these Americans
and basically he was slaughtered hitch
buck was slaughtered in mascara in a
Philadelphia I'm like a very little
heart LEDs color LED how do you destroy
anything with a heart LED on it and he's
got this like people with rubber
jerk-off gloves right there we don't
want to get a hand job analysis listen
we got paid for the hitch when you money
when you're hitchhiking to cut across
the country you got to have some kind of
toll you have you ready to get off a
handy
gonna pay your way very handy robot
that's um solar-powered too so you know
picking him up in the day is gonna get
you a lot further than at night
basically he's got a built-in GPS so the
researchers that Belton could see where
he was going across you know the globe
and whatnot but there was no built-in
surveillance gear so people couldn't
actually see who was beating the
out of him at the moment he got
slaughters there's your crowd by these
Philadelphians I don't know if they're
Philadelphians but they were definitely
American people in Philadelphia come on
Philly natural come on robot haters yeah
apparently I mean that racist against
Robo they probably thought he was gay
they probably felt like that's a gay
brother he's trying to give him my card
game that guy's trying to I think he
would have done better than he did I
mean I mean no honestly if hitchbot had
tried to start giving one of the dudes
driving him a handy like the guy like
the southern dude the southern American
be like are you trying to get up on my
dick you know what I mean I'm so glad we
have a sponsorship in this episode here
um so basically I'm trying to say is
Americans are assholes and freakin if
you see a robot on the side of the road
that's trying to hit your ride and he's
gonna give you a decent handy just let
him do it don't decapitate him or leave
him abandoned on the side of it it's
just it's a lot more uncomfortable when
it is like you know torn off pieces of
them and all that it's embarrassing
for us as other Americans who are not so
cruel to see the sort of thing so that's
just kind of what I wanted to point out
come on step it up that story moving on
we've got an acer XR 341 ck monitor and
it looks amazing do we do well we don't
have one apparently I missed this link
we don't have one hold on come on so
Acer's got a new monitor in store and oh
you screwed up I did you put their own
wait hold on what did i do I end it I'll
find it oh it's not how it hardware
right yeah is it on harbor ya think so
yeah cuz that's the hitchhiking robot oh
you know what I might have found it no
no it was on a pc monitors calm or
something like that it was like a really
generic
no I've got it I've got it right here pc
monitors calm is not available you're
lying oh look Paul look at the google
doc look at the google doc i just posted
the blanking right under it all right so
goddamn this monitor from Acer looks
frickin sweet actually Linus did a video
on it and I didn't realize that until I
started researching this monitor it's a
34 inch IPS curved ultra-wide they're
all the rage these days after all 34 40
x 1440 damn it's got the cool thing
about this it's got g-sync or free sync
so there's two different models you can
get oh it doesn't have both okay it
doesn't have the same like two different
chips someone you have to buy either one
separately you've got G but that's cool
though because if you really like this
monitor but you had an AMD card or an
nvidia card you might be like oh I wish
I had g-sync or I wish I had free sync
this one has models for both options got
a base amount I like that it's got a
base amount you can wall mount this
sucker it's awesome it goes 75 hurts or
up to 100 Hertz on a g-sync panel so the
free sync only doesn't 75g sync up to
100 it's got a hundred for sizing it's
got yeah it's kind of interesting it's
got a hundred percent srgb coverage
10-bit color which is not necessarily
true 10-bit color it's actually a bit
color but it's got dithering no yeah so
do you know you know mixing the pixels
and whatnot will give you that temper
color production so good for
professional color correction use and
things like that the g-sync model will
be available in October for 1299 and the
free sync panel will be available in
September slightly earlier also for
slightly less money doesn't give an
exact they have a bite link i'm going to
buy this on my it weights not for sale
now is it is 1099 dollars that's for
being said resync usually ships in 1 2 3
weeks free sync ogc
this one doesn't seem to indicate
whether it is the free sync or g-sync
version up maybe their technology g-sync
okay so i was going to juicing or
adaptive sink okay both of them so okay
maybe it infuse maybe it's a bit cheaper
than I originally stated so about a
thousand that's why most of the customer
questions and answers are is this a
g-sync yeah which perkin really the
product page has failed its job that's
that's pretty important information
actually it really is it really has if I
have a to fury exes you're not gonna buy
that want the g-sync version exactly so
at any rate it's about a thousand bucks
for this monitor 1100 about a thousand
about 1100 and then I think the the free
sync panel would be a bit cheaper
because the the chip that's used for
free sync is typically a bit cheaper to
the manufacturers who use them but yeah
that's about all I want to say about
that monitor keep an eye on its go ahead
and check out Linus's video on it why
not it's actually a good video he goes
into depth as opposed to most of us as
opposed to the regular cotton holy moly
no I Linus has a good job checking it
out and he also gives it his firm thumbs
up I mean somebody in chad is saying
g-sync is not available yet you are
wrong sir I started some what it's
saying jacek is not available yet I
don't know precinct jason gann free
sinker well maybe maybe he means the
g-sync model the juicing model is not
out that can be true that could be true
maybe yeah because it did say in the
article the the free sync would launch a
bit about a month earlier okay so there
you go keep an eye on it I really want
to get an ultra-wide I really do really
yeah I think it'd be fun or for gaining
because i hate triple panel setups I
just hate them I know some people like
swear by them and they love like and it
looks cool right I've got three monitors
an email I got one but honestly like I
just don't like the way that they kind
of they're not curved and like no matter
how you orient them they're always gonna
be like like a trapezoidal shape and
even if the bezel super thin I no bezels
are super thin nowadays and that's
that's a lot better than it used to be
but still I think just having one single
panel
ultra wide is the way to go for me I
feel like I don't know takes up less
space and i will say for curved I think
curved only makes sense for monitors I
don't like curved TVs exactly unless
you're forever alone I mean you're the
only Asian monitor makes makes more
sense and ultra wide the Thai resolution
than 1080 like the 1440 ones which I
forget what the horizontal is but 1440
vertical I 10 2160 are well the 14 4234
4034 40 x 1440 yeah the ultra whites
yeah that's what this one is ok yeah
yeah so something like that would
actually be quite interesting and I
agree having that broader likes I just
like completely horizontal space because
it fits a little bit more with like your
actual field of view right there not
having like to deal with bezels and
multiple monitors and everything like
that that's pretty cool yep ok alright
moving on to our next segment we've got
big saw me lower thirds singing the song
no space ah that's news hey every day
that's face off there yeah smooth smooth
ball smooth um ok so we've got a death
race is what we're playing today Paul
and I go head-to-head in a very
low-budget online to play our game I
hope this work I hope it does to earth
there it goes let me get thee let me get
the security alert no just screw
security of course proceed why don't we
get the load I'm gonna get the mouse the
chalice or the chalice of malice ok yeah
that's important so kyle kyle has become
alright so when Kyle first started face
up which is where Kyle and I play
against each other in a usually a
browser-based game the kyle has spent an
extensive amount of time practicing
beforehand um miss ally he was very
successful early on with this technique
he did not you did not count on my
innate skills as a gamer though so in
patent weeks in past weeks I have been
coming out on top despite Kyle bringing
in the chalice of malice is at
I think we'll go with that it's actually
a Paul tardar mug with a series of
potential punishments in there or things
we might have to do basically that the
loser might have to do I have not
screened any of these by the way so I
hope there's nothing in there where I'm
just like I'm not doing that oh there
will be there will be all right I
guarantee it so what game are we playing
today playing death race so what death
race is is it's basically a high-octane
version of snake that's been re you know
reimagined in 3d rendered fantasmic
pneus as you can see it's very Tron like
these are basically anything yet hold on
we're basically trying to avoid each
other where you're basically creating a
line like a snail trail everywhere you
go okay and the idea is to not run into
your own we kind of played this game
already we did but this is like the 2
point 0 version I think this is a better
version I think I'm gonna beat you at
this game so that's also my controls are
ZX + space what a space do spaces jump
so you can actually jump you can leap oh
it's like snake but you can leap over
the line the other person's lying yes
you can yes see it's totally different
it's a completely different game that
way all right do we get any do we get a
practice round here we can do one
practice round no I fine well we'll be
one practice round since I've already
played it once and you haven't played it
all see I'm being fair I'm being very
good for that's right ZX + space right
let's just go forward here wait all
right here get like oh yeah this is this
is awake I'm green so I'm green although
seriously strong because we're in like a
3d environment yeah
i'm currently just drawing circles
around myself so you can it oh ok so
that was the practice round i won you
won because i ran into your your
I scroll down so get up against tea oh
there you there yeah all right so um now
that Paul is a master at this game in
the fifth five seconds of playing I we
are now gonna play for reals two and
three okay look at three all right let's
do it and then the loser will have to
draw I'm the pink on top by the way yes
you're the pink on top oh oh what it's
like I went to him no way like I was
cute why did you stare directly into my
pad I didn't know you were going that
way my peripheral vision is why I need
new glasses you're gonna get home
Tristan see you see you there you stay
away from me oh there's a wall of the oh
so we're at 121 did not know there was a
wall opiate it's not infinite this is a
limited limited is a slave Ocarina the
rear play limited same day alright so
this is for all the marbles guys we go
all right post in chat who thinks gonna
win I like oh wrong mouse
confusing to mice hope I don't hit the
wall yeah i mean my awesome oh there's a
bit of lag on her to tell you that oh
wow oh my goodness oh oh shoot dearmond
how is that possible I cannot win a
freaking face off unbelievable I'm
really discouraged at this point I just
don't know what's wrong with me do you
want to turn carrot and browsing on
carrot I don't know no no I don't know I
prefer we really if if it's any
indication as to why Kyle screwed
himself at that game we had to use
internet explorer to play it that's
problem that was Preston that's the
problem a shin right there wasn't my
gaming a pillow geez come on hey all
right here we go here's to the victor
yeah whatever whatever let's see what
the see what terrible punishment kyle is
this inflicted upon I'm gonna I'm gonna
like have to do all the punishments cuz
i wrote all of these i'm gonna have to
do all the ones that I wrote myself he
did hey what is it drink rest of your
beer out of a bowl for the rest of the
show that's silly do you have a bowl I
have you prepared a bowl i haven't this
oh i didn't think i was gonna lose let
alone a half of that one what if I had
pictured all right below me and me
should I should I put it in a bowl
should I get a bowl week punishment by
the way what do you mean it's not even
know because it'll be guess it's like
kupit because a saucer would be
would be funny a saucer that doubles all
right I have to I to drink the rest of
my beer out of this beer kennel that
doesn't make sense why not gonna go get
a bowl because you can't buy think it's
the bad I I mean I can that makes no
sense yeah um alright what's yeah we had
to download internet explorer in order
to play that game okay look look at the
look at what we have this excellent
lighting right now I know Twilight
like magic hour setting in California
and that's what it looks like every day
ever watch like you guys are here I'm
gonna I'm gonna party was based in
California and they use this filter that
makes everything look like I'll orange
like there's this glorious sunset going
on the whole time that's okay we never
turn the lights on that's important to
us because going to sounds good net oh
no that was not plugged in I think it's
fine damn you that's it it's yeah it's
plenty of great I think beautiful no hit
a bowl Cal's gonna go get a bowl
everyone in the meantime I'm going to
regale you with some stories of my time
in the army actually I was never in the
army so I don't have any stories but
what I am going to do in the meantime is
play that game again what do you guys
think play some more damn it I close the
window nevermind i can't play it all
right I have nothing to do right now
this is I don't even care this is kyle's
half of the show so if it sucks what's
the matter to me right okay here's what
i can tell you guys but here's our
rocket fan that you guys maybe have seen
right there it is now the funny thing
about the rocket fan is i've been using
it way too much i've used this thing to
cool off my router you said you said my
side of the show sucks but no i was just
saying that it doesn't matter to me if I
do something like insanely I heard you
so let's try to point out here is my
rocket fan has been acting funny lately
but it's because I've had it plugged in
24 7 pointed at my router cuz my router
has been not working one hundred percent
appropriately lately it's kind of funny
cap see see I thought the I thought of
these punishments I well thought them
out so you'll notice for example that it
stops unless you give it a kick start
it's a little kick start and then every
once a while the LEDs all you've been
doing to fill the time let's talk about
your fail I gotta fill this is the time
i was gonna play the game some more but
the game was already a fan so there's my
rocket fan anyway i'm using this to all
right not overheat while we're doing the
show okay is it really 713 it is a 15
minutes good 15 minutes okay it's a good
thing because you only have to
I think we're gonna wear / it down to
one segment what we're doing pin my pc
we have to skip Q&amp;amp;A Cal we got people
have questions we need to answer them
okay blow up and chat if you want us to
be at mi pc or Q&amp;amp;A I little were you
ain't in my pc right I'm saying we have
time for both we have 15 okay all right
let's go swim let's go the first one uh
usually takes well you're right at this
it's like the biggest time suck of the
show all right here's pup shepherd pup
shepherd leave this system look at it oh
pop Shepherd I gotta give you props
right off the bat for using your
freaking stickers all these stickers are
coming i have a collocation badges I
have a collection of stickers and case
badges and I've been like looking for a
useful place from I used to put them
like if I had a case with a door I'd put
them inside the door or something like
that mmm but I don't know even though
granted it's you know aesthetically or
whatever it's know that pleasing to look
at right like yeah I like that you
wouldn't even got the Dolby one on there
you've gone above and beyond sir that
doesn't that doesn't excuse you from
atrocious cable management coming out of
your coming out of your hard drives what
is happening it looks like you've
mounted them backwards when you could
have mounted them the correct way and
have actually all the same deportes the
state of cables coming out from the back
from behind the other board dress what
case is this I don't know but please
tell me the hard drives melt the other
way oh god oh god right the hard drives
need to mount the other way if possible
if at all possible and there's a lot of
dust in there get some dust just just
SWAT switch those hard drives around
tidy up the front panel connectors the
bottom of your motherboard if you want
to get really fancy get some black
sleeve cables for your power supply
maybe some extensions so you know those
nasty red and yellow cables you all
right I don't know if this is the case
or not or if it's just a picture but if
you have if you still have a little
piece of plastic on top of your corsair
logo on the on your h100i or whatever
that is peel that off yeah that is
actually kind of funny I told you I was
there a bowl um I should get a sweet but
yeah uh
that's it let's go on dusty man look at
this picture there's there's a lot of
desk alone on their this I see your
handprint yeah this is one of those
systems that like I would feel really
good to me just to like remove
everything place everything off to the
side yeah like dust everything off
individually and then put it all back
together with with with fresh cable
management where I've already assembled
the system Brian know what where
everything goes yeah you going into
cable management with that in mind
already really really helps so so yeah
all right moving on the next week's
percent uh nope up Thank You pup next we
got Ron who's sending in his rig looks
like it define our for possibly I don't
see a single Drive in those drive cages
so 770 Canada gtx 780 saving it for mark
willing he also wants to saving up for
water cooling so before you even get to
the water cooling part just remove those
drive cages because it'll open up the
air flow for those front two fans those
fans pump out quite a bit of air but
they're being stifled by the drive cages
which you're really not using for
anything other than your sleeved fan
cable which seems to be going down the
the left side of the drive cages which
doesn't look all that nice i'm confused
by that actually yeah so i'm not sure
maybe tuck that away behind the
motherboard tray if you can also the the
cable that's coming from the left a your
your graphics card there's another I
think that's another your rear fan your
exhaust fan cable is kind of crossing
over your PCI slots and that looks a
little sloppy I I like the attention to
detail for the color scheme though
you've gone with red black and white and
you've even taken the time to buy some
corsair SP fins or I'm sorry those are
probably AF fans as well as the ax 760
power supply the sticker matches
perfectly with your color scheme again
drive cages that cable a few cables that
need to be tucked away and I think
you're good make sure you're cleaning it
I can't tell from the picture again if
it's dusty or not it looks like the top
of that power supply might have some
dust on it if does go ahead and clean it
out they're good cell and chat also
pointed out that you got a little bit of
GPU sag going on there yeah which is
always a difficult question for how to
combat but i would suggest in this
particular situation if you take your
Peggy connector
pci express graphics power connectors
pull them go up with them depending if
you have a left length but i think you
should go up with them to the same area
where you're a TX is coming out go go go
I'll put them to hear where you're a TX
is coming out of and you can maybe use
those to just give that a little bit of
lift and kind of get rid of that sag
yeah you rewire everything but give them
but nice build yeah thanks Ron next
we've got FP droid his system look he's
got a 3570k which integrate more
gigahertz a gtx 970 nice combo by the
way i like i like the older processor
with a newer GPU because it's still
gonna be a really nice gaming system
eight gigs of hyperx fury and an NZXT s
340 yeah so um really nice system here i
think i really do love the sleeve cables
the extensions that you've put in there
yeah i think it matches the ram really
nice i think you're kind of going for a
blue and white theme based on your
motherboard ooh excuse me Wow drinking
that beer that bolt mmm it's the bowl
it's totally that's all the bowl based
on the motherboard and ram that you've
got there blue and white looks great but
then the video card ever size card again
a 970 great card but it's red so I feel
like the red blue and white doesn't
exactly mesh all that nicely I'm gonna
I'm gonna oppose your viewpoint here and
I will say that this is a very patriotic
merica if you're in America you got red
white and blue well thanks ball actually
here's whoa mark here's my issue with
this build you have pegged connector
extension cables you have a 24-pin
extension cable and you've got both of
those which probably cost you at least
20 bucks if not 30 yeah before you
upgraded your cpu cooler right now
unless he already had those unless you
already have from yoga don't like that
from a practical perspective and I know
I'm pit my pc to talk about aesthetics a
lot but from a practical perspective
here i would have much rather seen that
thirty bucks invested in hyper 212 evo
yeah or equivalent cooler or even better
maybe the enter max
you it was black where is it a dark
twister you have it yeah you have one
that's right there blockbuster the ETS
t40 black twister yep which is only
about 10 bucks more than that and it's
all black and has a blue LED and would
match perfectly in the system yeah
that'd be a good candidate for it ambia
upgrade guide priced and it's a 3570k to
you could get a hawk you could get more
performance out of that with only like
with not a whole lot of investment so
with an air cooler yeah definitely my
first my number one first thing here
they upgrade that air cooler did a
little bit overclocking take your you're
at 4 gigahertz 4.2 4.4 easy easy with a
3570k those are the clock better than
Haswell my feet for the just just
don't waste it nope nothing no man left
behind duping going on over here yeah
alright thanks Fe droid next up we've
got Jason Jason yeah your rig looks good
it's uh it's gold or yellow it's in a
really an older case and it's on the
floor if you go Paul yeah it's on the
floor and on the carpet my new on the
carpet which i think is like a double no
no it's a deep cool case I can't tell I
know something like that or raidmax or
something like that tesoro what is that
works or oh I don't know so sorta makes
cason at any rate it's a very budget
case that's probably a couple years old
and I think based on your motherboard
which looks intact micro-atx maybe it's
a very overly size case I think you have
a lot more room in this case then you
really need and I think maybe even
whatever front fans that you have there
aren't really reaching the arrow cool
the the back components so honestly I
would probably opt for a smaller case
and also probably the reason why you
have on the floor is because you don't
have much room on your desk and so to
save data saves desk space you're
putting it on the floor but if you had a
smaller case that was more appropriate
for the size of your motherboard then I
think you could probably get away with
putting it on your desk and you wouldn't
have to clean it out
is often and it would just stay cleaner
for longer and it would look a lot
tidier as well because when you actually
have a small motherboard put in a larger
case you actually have to stretch the
cables from your motherboard to those
grommets or whatever the the cutouts in
your motherboard tray a lot further and
it looks a bit more Octopussy I should
say I just said no you can say that um
alright that and yeah and the color
coordination I think needs to be
adjusted a bit unless I see I see a
little bit of potential here yeah of
course I think I knew a new case is
gonna do wonders this is an arrow cool
power supply which is 80 plus I'm trying
to figure out if it's 80 plus now that's
not that's bronze yeah it's 80 plus
bronze all right i don't i don't know
how how good your power supplies that
case isn't terrible though now it's a
black painted interior it's just too big
it's too big it's too big for that you
got a micro ATX and a truncated micro
ATX at that motherboard dwarfism so yeah
the motherboards a little bit too small
but this I could see you upgrading the
core components here your motherboard
processor memory and graphics card and
stick in with a case for the time being
yeah you know you get a little two-step
upgrade going through the future so that
way you can save some of the components
for another bill but I wouldn't take too
much time investing on this until you
upgrade those core components yeah
because that's where you get a lot more
performance out of the thank you Jason
thank you Sam Evan next up we've got the
covert camper all right he's got an hour
five define our five beautiful case is
the one I'm using right now by the way I
want to give a white and orange theme I
want to get a wine orange theme but that
needs a lot of modding yeah sure does
but it is possible and I think there's
definitely opportunity for that here you
can easily mask off the yellow in the RM
of your power supply and that corsair RM
series power supply and you can make
that orange instead of yellow I think
that'd be a good start and also the PCI
slots this is kind of what I've done for
my custom water-cooled bill that I've
been working on recently is I spray
painted those it's a pink grain black
build that i spray-painted the the white
pci slots just like those and my same
define our five pink just to match the
rest of the orange of my build
and it came out beautiful so I think
that is also a good way to make things
orange if you want I don't know if you
want to keep the white in your ex I nine
series board I think that'd be a good
choice because I think it'd be a lot of
work and and take a lot of skill to
actually spray paint the heatsink and
stuff orange we sound like taking all
the white accents in this build and
training them orange I think I don't
know maybe a like a white orange black
color scheme you know like a creamsicle
type thing if it might look you are like
a 50-50 bar bar to me is white and
orange though the white orange the black
black doesn't mesh as well I can see it
being done I think it's odd to be
careful if you want yeah if you want it
to all go well together this though I
mean apart from the long-term goals of
the orange build and everything an hour
spent on this with cable management
could really clean up everything and
make it a lot more appealing the the
power supply cables down here just can
be pulled back behind the motherboard
tray a little bit better you've got your
other loose cables hanging around here
for the power supply air for the like
peg connectors for the SATA connectors
over there right your-your-your CPU
coolers fine that's perfect yeah and
then you just a little bit more tuk-tuk
more that stuff back behind the
motherboard tray yes it's Finn's just I
also want to make a clarification some
people in chat were saying well Kyle you
have a define ass not to define our five
as I initially stated I actually do have
it define our five for my personal main
editing rig that has been built since
the haswell-e lunch months and months
and months ago but yes the custom
water-cooled build that I have currently
is a defined s gonna make that make that
clarification sorry if there was an
effusion um I was confused you're
confused Paul wasn't confused because he
knows the ins and outs of of all of my
deepest darkest fractal tech and all the
travel ins and outs I don't want to have
any visuals about Josh right now that I
don't know what that means okay yes uh
thanks dog ever Oh was on time oh we've
got like one more thing to go link link
your build it looks good I like it now
your cpu cooler
vertically I think because you've got
you know the fans of the front and
they're blowing to the left I think a
lot of your heat sink could benefit from
the intake air of those fans if it was
mounted more I agree it's not flammable
it's possible it's actually probably
possible it is because looks like you is
not in the top slot so yeah I agree
hundred percent there yep do it uh and
get some sleep extensions that's it
everything's 4690 a high 44 this is like
cooler master is slightly higher end
hyper 212 yes a Suzy 97 pnp and why and
that's it right there's only one stick
of memory in there put a stick of memory
in there set up set up dual channel put
some memory in that yeah get some dual
channel yep other than that your wire
looks like there's three dimm slots not
is there's three empty and one populated
oh that's why I can't see it yeah um
other than that your wiring is nice yeah
the green from your LEDs doesn't quite
match the paint on the case but that's
hard to do anyway yeah that's okay yeah
look that rotate that cpu cooler good
build man probably prove your your
performance here your cooling actually a
bit too Thank You lake and we do not
have time for QA but instead we will go
into our Johnson shout outs yes we do
have some some Johnson's that we owe
y'all Evan I'll start first Evan from
Grayson joja another Georgian so many
Georgians you have a gem I love Georgia
do you have an Evan do we get double
Johnson I am ever not I need to refresh
so Evan thank you for picking up a void
my warranty shirt those are those are
some of my favorite that's one of my
favorite tricks actually Brad not gonna
say your last name Brad Minerva yeah I
Oh double Johnson to bread double
Johnson to bread for sure yeah I thank
you for picking up a cpu cooler shirt
and also a shirt or something from Paul
somebody picked out thumbscrew shirt
thumbscrews shirt and isolate them and
lastly for me ivan from lake station in
the apolis thank you for picking up a
cpu cooler shirt I appreciate a brother
Johnson to all of you guys thank you
appreciate it and I already said Justin
Patrick I believe right because we
already yes
yay red hissing oh yeah I think that's
it thanks for all the Johnsons that's a
show thank you guys I'm just spilling
beer all over my tits in a bowl guys
give me a break all right it's in a bowl
drinking beer out of a bowl it's not
natural balbir feel very emasculated
right now so thank you guys for watching
the show yeah if you were watching this
on the reupload be sure to LIKE the
video on YouTube and go ahead and check
outside a if you haven't already if
you're just kind of that person who
likes to watch the second half before
the first time you know go ahead and
watch what's up for any account we're
not because you you left a very
important thing out of your out of your
side of the show what we have a sponsor
we do have a sponsor let's sponsor the
show right now why don't you remind me
cuz I okay because neither of us
remembered that we have a amazing
sponsor for the show today all right our
first time with the spots here and our
defense hopefully not our last in our
defense we have the gigabyte Z 170 x
gaming g1 motherboard from gigabyte
today shows brought to you by gigabyte
there we go thats our sponsor you got
some hardware yes this is an awesome
board hey some other things that you
might not have noticed about this board
for the accessories let me let me just
tell you about the halcyon thing i'm
clean a fun day you guys are closer look
closer look at this board sometimes more
exciting than the board itself paul
technology sometimes more exciting than
the board itself me the board here here
we're gonna get the board and do closest
just take the damn bored just take it so
it's a good board I honestly haven't
seen anything as far as the accessories
go so this is all new to me what is this
oh cool so it's a five-minute quarter
inch Bay with a USB 3.1 and USB 3.1 type
c 0 actually worth two nothing from this
cool it is yeah take a look at it slots
right into your your five-minute quarter
inch ebay in your case so the nice thing
about this is that it actually connects
up in the back
via SATA Express there you go so say to
express to me I keep being like what is
the point of SATA Express when they're
absolutely no SATA Express drives to be
to be seen on the market but they've
actually taken that been like well you
can use your SATA Express for it and
connect up and get a front panel USB 3.1
port and then they added a type C there
as well so that's a breakout box it
comes along with this board there it is
you've also got what is this oh this is
the SATA Express cable for that exact
thing you have a Wi-Fi adapter with
antenna because this does have built-in
Wi-Fi which is I really do love to see
boards whether they're high end or low
end to have Wi-Fi adapters on them
nowadays I appreciate it's just very
yeah very very handy to have um also I
love I absolutely love what gigabyte
desert or SATA cables they feature yes
the the standard straight straight angle
and right angle cables but they are all
sleeved as far as the high end
motherboards go they are sleeved and
nice black sexist leaving and I
absolutely love them they're my favorite
SATA cables like ever I have not seen
any of these sleeved ones they're
amazing I I had them on my my gaming g1
why hasn't been working with enough high
and gigabyte boards yeah absolutely so
you get six of those awesome did we
mention that this is a Z 170 board
that's not available yet on the market I
did mention that but I didn't mention
that it was unavailable but obviously
yes is you can't buy these yet SLI and
crossfire bridges a ribbon style
flexible kata style um bridges right
there and then it got a nice little box
here with some more rigid some more
rigid bridges Bridget bit Jesu purchase
4-way SLI and 3-way SLI yeah I'm
actually probably going to use maybe one
of these for a future build like the rig
that like the ridge of one's even if
even with a two-way set up you can use
them to give you a graphics card more
support yes as you can we've also got
the apart from the manual and screws and
things like that you also have the i/o
shield which does light up in the back
so if you're trying to fiddle around or
fidget with any cables that are behind
your case and it's usually in a dark
area as we all know what a serval that
can be
does light up so you can kind of see
where you're plugging things into you
can see all your ports very easily very
handy to have we've also got a nice
little adapter here for your front panel
connectors so you know where everything
goes power reset led this is one way to
take all of your front panel connectors
and plug it into this little block hip
and then the single block plugs into
this plug right here makes everything
easier yet make it a simpler situation
for plugging Denali front panels and
then we have a MDOT to adapter of sorts
this is say to express I believe this is
a u dot to adapt you'd ought to you
ought to oh that's right for these newer
these newer drives like the Intel 750
for example and via me what's your nvme
drives so you can get a couple different
versions one plugs directly into a pci
express slot or you can use this which
basically plugs into one your n dot two
slots right here and then it gives you a
mini SAS adapter or connect our plug on
it and then you plug that up to connect
the drive don't give me any of that sass
so if you don't want to use up a pci
express slot it can allow you to still
just connect up an nbme drive in a 2.5
inch form factor which is quite nice so
i'm glad they included that with the box
indeed but that's a quick look at the g1
gaming motherboard this is a Z 170
motherboard is going to support skylake
processors so sit your 6760 600 k
processors which will be out oh so very
soon Cal is just going to sit here and
fall asleep on the board now you drool
on it a little bit i'm gonna i'm gonna
click off we got about I'm really fine
Paul red damask oh alright we are
totally over schedule and to be
respectful of your guys's time as well
as mine because I need to get to
planning my freakin wedding that's on
Friday we are gonna end the show right
now so thank you to our special sponsor
gigabyte again for helping us host the
show tonight and thank you for all of
you for tuning in and staying with us
this long again it's been fun see you
guys next week or at least Paul will see
you guys next week I'll be hopping
around on social media you'll see me in
some videos as well but stay tuned for
next week's awesome hardware worth
all will be having a special guest Jays
two cents date season on and it should
be um thank you guys are about tech have
a good night we love you all and goodbye
cheers everyone to please me
