what's going on guys welcome back to
stack attack the ultimate 1v1 gaming
showdown where virtual combat meets real
life challenges today I will be going
head-to-head with the one and only Chris
our beloved and trusty camera op who's
currently not manning the camera you're
fired
but there should be a lot of fun we're
gonna be playing csgo arms race and
Chris do you have any last words before
we get started yeah I saw a streaming
last Monday on port Knight and I'm not
too worried I'm chillin
I think that's gonna be easy game is it
possible to fire you twice no the rules
of stack attack are simple before the
match begins four attack cards are dealt
randomly to each player players can play
their attacks on each other at almost
any time during the match but only one
attack per player can be in effect at a
time all attack cards are single-use
only the effects of some attacks are
time-based
while others expire once a challenge has
been completed once per match a player
can summon a stack attack by playing two
cards at once to deal a devastating
combo once the player in the lead is one
kill or point away from winning they'll
have to surrender all their unused
attack cards to the other player those
are the rules may the best player win
alright guys so we're gonna switch
things up a little bit this time around
instead of explaining all eight of our
attack cards like we usually do at the
beginning of the game we're actually
gonna be explaining them when they're
played during the match just to save
time and jump us into the game a little
bit sooner but that being said we are
ready to deal them out so let's have
wifey sauce come over here and do the do
us the kindness of shuffling these guys
up and deal in a map yeah give me the
car do your thing
all right just grab your crappy hand oh
you got you've got the good ones
oh yeah I know I like you less than I
usually I don't know get over there get
to your desk yes sir
with pleasure can't wait to kick your
ass
prepare today
all right Chris are you ready no guess
kind of maybe that's good enough for me
let's get this show on the road in three
two one go okay I'm feeling kind of
nervous but at the same time not at all
because I'm pretty confident my skills
being a casual gamer so hopefully this
will be good for me I'm actually a
little nervous to go up against Chris I
mean he's still young and sprightly he's
good at games and personally I swore off
playing with young boys a long time ago
but I'll try anything once
Oh getting shot at he's just he's
kicking in here he's gonna get first
blood oh Jesus in the head
that's right oh the only way you know uh
another headshot Oh God we go tasted
defeat is upon me oh my heart is pumping
oh my god is pumping a lot I may have
underestimated my enemy here let's see
how you are with tunnel vision huh okay
oh god this is horrible I can't I can't
even what the heck okay no no no no wear
it I think fast Chris there you are no
okay I'm kind of getting the hang of
this here
NoHo you know it's not that bad looking
out of this thing I can see perfectly
fine out of here I mean it's just a
little hole away oh oh I can barely see
anything no better if I if I back up
like this get more more surface area to
see where wait wait what well you got
five oh wow I'm losing hard core I can
feel the face to cake on my face or you
know you have some attack cards to Chris
it's due that's saying I do I don't
think you like dude you probably didn't
think you'd be using with this early on
okay Lube oh god oh god I figured why
not start out with lubed what better way
than to get lubed up for the game this
is the second least appropriate time
I've ever been waged by Chris here we go
uh I see your head oh no no oh okay
maxing out mouse sensitivity to eight
I'm also gonna increase my DPI ok now
this this is impossible
No oh oh my god wait where I can't see I
have to be like to play 2 inches from
your face and retain my screen wait I
hear you oh no oh my god do the
sensitivity predict I forgot my frickin
timer I hear I hear footsteps backup
I must backup No
trying to catch up
oh no way what's it like being lubed by
Chris well everything's slippery and
your aim is horrible huh oh my god like
Medicare trigger yes yes already huh oh
never oh never again all right let's do
this
one-shot wonder here that is such a
satisfying feel feeling to just okay
well they got it I got
oh shit goodness for timers oh shit oh
shit mouth I hate you so much
I hate you so much oral invasion huh all
right which one of these fits in my
mouth here anything to back to big great
this is gonna this is gonna suck I just
played oral invasion on Chris thank
goodness we don't have an HR department
oh my god okay try not to drool in all
my peripherals okay what is that all
right so I got a wheel here and the
freaking handcuffs okay headshot I'm
stacking these two cars because they
know off the bat that messing with his
eyesight and locking his arm to his
ankle is gonna really mess with them two
senses and one go to recipe for disaster
the car doesn't fit it doesn't fit
around my damn oh oh ow oh God all of
that hurts I should go I see cuz this is
impossible I can't see shit these
handcuffs barely fit around my ankle and
it's really starting to hurt at this
point especially when I have to mouse
around with the hand that's handcuffed
to my ankle not to mention this stupid
wheel that I have to continually spin
otherwise I'm essentially blind
it's not ideal oh this is help I'm
running away
okay get running I'll go away Chris oh
no no okay
not right now Oh hugs actually very I
can't lie dude I don't mind not running
into you right now I cannot I agree to
the life buddy
I put these two cards down so that I
could get ahead of him but now I can't
find the guy like come on Chris
solid move your thirst and that hurt I
really wish I could see what's going on
over there right now
where's up hell yeah
ah oh no coming off here no yeah look
some nut I need to nut out hers oh thank
god this is that all right that's right
oh sorry
both oh my god Wow Wow come on get the
damn oh oh oh that's gonna leave a mark
oh come on that's the elk mouse goes
Tommy Boy
oh so we're right smack in the middle of
the game and to my surprise I'm not
dominating Kyle as much as I thought I
would be which only has one explanation
Kyle are you aim bahding
I'm just having the worst day of aiming
for the warmed up Wow headshot with a
shoddy from across the way right a bad
night Oh what oh yeah as a sniper I do
earthquake oh my okay here we go
time to catch up dude
okay it's literally impossible to do
anything right now my screen is shaking
so violently I keep thinking my systems
about to be sawn okay seriously I'm
basically just a sitting duck like you
should just be able to find me and kill
me that's the thing I can't find here
oh no and just seems spazzing out in the
room well no I'm not the room I'm not
here no not oh my so I knew it
earthquake was gonna be effective I
didn't think it was gonna be this
effective like my god
the the guy is literally having a spasm
where he's having a seizure right in
front of me and I can't help but laugh
while I'm shooting him in the head
Bootsy oh wait I got you so sorry oh you
just got hit with foot see Chris prepare
to face defeat wait I can't turn around
without picking it up oh come here
I must knife you know away from you see
this right here this is an opposable
thumb my foot doesn't have an opposable
thumb and it's so dang hard to aim and
shoot with this thing yep no shooting I
D or what I'm going through right now oh

your feet yes

I like how it got all quiet wait a
second
I heard someone there you are oh no way
oh my and Chris take the lead whoa hate
you so much oh what's the help no sonar
wait oh wait that drink oh wait sonar is
an interesting attack because I can
essentially fire Chris's gun any time to
figure out where he is on the map I just
hope that he doesn't pull out his knife
or have a silenced weapon Oh God did you
not
all I got a silencer oh are you serious
oh my god
No
I can see the facepalm from here Chris
could this be any more like nerve
