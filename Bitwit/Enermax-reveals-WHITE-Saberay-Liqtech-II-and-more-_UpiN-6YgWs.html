brought to you by fantex berta gear
enter max be quiet and cable mod you can
learn more about their products and the
links below what's going on guys we're
here at the enter max suite at Computex
2018 taking a look at some of their
products I'm actually really excited to
take a look at some of these areas this
is their lick tech 2 which arrives in q3
of this year very highly anticipated
successor to the super popular lick tech
one or just the regular lick Tech's but
these are great 500 watt TDP capacity
these things are gonna cool like
monsters this one in particular that
you're looking at is the 240 version
it's got two twister bearing fans super
high quality I like I just really love
the blacked-out scheme and the radiator
thickness is actually 32 millimeters
thick so definitely a lot of cooling
potential here very you know very nice
fin density I can see right here sleeve
tubing you've got RGB lighting at the
front with that nice glossy finish
that's of course compatible with several
different RGB software's for your
motherboard if you don't have an RGB
supported motherboard you can also have
control through this included controller
so you can just switch around there you
don't really need to have the latest
board to take advantage of the the
various aesthetic features here but this
is only the 240 model they're also gonna
offer it as a 360 and a 280 as well all
the pricing that they mentioned is very
competitive
I believe 109 for the 240 and then that
scales upward from there but you can see
this is a white one so we actually have
a white lick tech 2 that's that's
fantastic
fantastic and then we also have some
silver sleeving I kind of like how they
went with silver sleeving not just the
traditional black that we see with a lot
of white arrows these days even notice
that the block itself is white - that's
that's pretty cool
the radiator is fully white it's got
some black trim around but this is more
of a standard 27 millimeter thick
radiator but again I'm sure this is
gonna do some amazing damage when it
comes to cooling your CPU with that 500
watt TDP if you're curious at all about
the pump that these coolers are using
it's actually got an ef-1 pump that's
their own in-house brand there's no ASA
tech here they really wanted to craft
these guys from the ground up and it's
got an insane flow rate of 450
per hour it's actually the same pump
that's being used in their existing tr4
model which is a fantastic cooler on its
own and if you're also curious about
compatibility these are supporting all
the major Intel and AMD sockets for AMD
risin a m4 again tr4 for thread Ripper
and Federer / - that's going to be a
completely different line but let's move
on now this is one of the cooler coolers
that I've seen in recent months this is
their lick fusion we actually took a
first look at this at CES earlier this
year so it's not incredibly new but the
demo that they have here today is a bit
more up and running than it was at CES
you can see they've got an actual
controller connected now so apart from
RGB software with your motherboard you
can actually control the lighting
effects with this controller which it
doesn't look like I'm doing a very good
job of it right now but you get the idea
the RGB fans are fantastic looking
they're bright I mean it's really well
lit here
at the Nangang Exhibition Centre and I
can see all the lighting on this unit
perfectly and also the flow indicator
inside of this this water block is just
it's it's not just mesmerizing but it's
functional and it lets you know it gives
you that peace of mind that that you are
getting a decent flow rate through this
cooler at all times and also a nice
little weird addition here so it's sort
of a quirk is that they've actually
included the pump alongside the the
sleeving here and that obviously gives
you room for that flow indicator in the
water block so be on the lookout for
this cooler as well I don't know if you
guys are aware but enter max is one of
the brands that has actually signed up
with the tough gaming Alliance
partnering with Asus and so they've
actually come together to bring you guys
this TGA or tough gaming alliance Revo
Bron pack which actually includes this
as power supply I believe it is okay I
just got confirmation it's 500 600 and
700 Watts available 80 plus bronze
certified looks pretty sweet it's got
sort of a nice pattern here that would
obviously match a tough motherboard any
day the week the fan seems seems fairly
fairly durable and quiet although it's
kind of hard to tell right now then
we've also got in the same package not
only will you get the power supply but
it comes included with three RGB fans
either these are twister bearing high
quality fans that obviously have our GB
lighting there super fancy looking but
this is really cool as this little
controller that unfortunately only works
with the Revo braun power supply but it
does some pretty cool stuff depending on
how you want it configured
there's a
or mode that'll actually keep the fins
at zero rpm until it gets to about 4045
percent load on your system and then it
will ramp up so you get just absolute
silent performance when you're not
taxing the system very heavily there's
also a fan delay option so after you
turn your system off you know let's say
you've been gaming for a long session or
something like that the fans will
continue spinning for you know around a
minute more so that it just cools your
components down it's not great to just
do a hard stop and let your hot
components just sit there smoldering
like lava and there's a bunch of other
cool features you can do with this unit
so altogether this package is here for
you guys if you're interested very cool
stuff and now if you're looking for
something a little bit beefier than that
TG a power supply this is the max type
this is 80-plus titanium certified with
over 94% efficiency it comes in two
flavors 1250 or 1050 watts based on your
needs and it also includes that cool
little fan controller that we just took
a look at I should also mention you can
not use this if you don't want to take
advantage of the semi passive cooling or
anything like that one great thing about
this fan and just this unit in general
is that it actually runs in passive mode
so 0 rpm on the fan up to 60 or 70%
system load which is actually one of the
highest in the industry so most of the
time this thing is going to be
absolutely silent in your system unless
you're putting it under the heaviest of
workloads one thing of note is that it
is a fairly large unit as you might
expect so make sure that you've got a
compatible case and as you also might
expect fully modular design you look at
all those dust covers I just want to pop
them all off can we do that can we just
like top off all the covers ooh this is
fun oh they're gonna kick me out any day
now we're gonna kick me out right about
so you guys probably remembered the
animatics a beret for CES this was
actually one of my favorite cases at the
show floor earlier this year and it
still is actually a really great case in
my opinion but if you look over here you
get pretty much all the same
functionality but in a very nice wide
aesthetic with addressable RGB 's going
down the same sides it just looks
fantastic I am oh you guys let me know
what you think about the saber Rey in
white this is gonna be coming later this
year soon enough you'll be able to get
your hands on it but if you wanted
something a little bit more exclusive
well this is sort of a concept project
right now this is also a sabre it's the
saber a advanced
also has addressable RGB lighting like
the white version but you get dual
tempered glass side panels that are
completely tooless not exactly sure if
this is the exact the exact method that
they're going with but it also kind of
pops out like that so it doesn't
completely shatter there's sort of a
catch to it right that we've seen on
some other cases this year but all
together a very nice case and if you
look up top we actually get USB 3.1 gen2
type-c it's it's a prototype right now
so it still says USB 3 there but rest
assured you do get a type-c connector
which is absolutely fantastic
so that's pretty much gonna wrap it up
for enter max here at their suite at
Computex 2018 but one last thing i
wanted to give you guys before I sign
off there's actually a cool little demo
that they have set up here where they've
got their water block with the ef-1 pump
right here versus a competing pump this
is just a competitor's water block and
you can see that they're each hooked up
to their own reservoir if I hit the
green button there's kind of a little
bit of a showcase here to show you that
the the flow rates and just the the
amount of force and power that this pump
is able to pump out haha is actually
demolishing the competition in a very
very tangible way so there you go look
forward to all this cool stuff from
enter max coming very soon I know I'm
pumped and thank you guys for watching
this video go ahead and check out the
links from all my awesome sponsors in
the description below and I'll see you
guys very soon in the next video
