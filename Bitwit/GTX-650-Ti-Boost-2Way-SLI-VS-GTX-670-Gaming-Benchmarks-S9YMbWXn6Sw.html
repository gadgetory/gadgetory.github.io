already know NVIDIA has recently
released their GTX 650 Ti boost and this
is essentially a massive performance
increase from the GTX 650 Ti and that
this card is much more ready out of the
box for 1080 resolution gaming whereas
you still could do some 1080 gaming on
the 650 Ti except it just wasn't a huge
performer in that arena he kind of had
to make sure that you weren't playing
any graphically intensive games or that
you really just had to above the
resolution down so in order to meet that
1080 gaming resolution requirement I
guess you could say NVIDIA has
definitely made some sizable adjustments
to this card with 650 Ti boost in that
it comes default with a two gigs frame
buffer so this is reference card design
I have right here just comes with two
gigs right out of the box and the stuff
from that's got a wider memory bus
interface 192 as opposed to 128 bit with
the GTX 650 Ti so I think that it's just
got a higher clock frequency in general
it's it's got n videos GPU boost 1.0
that is but the one other feature that
sets this card apart from the 650 Ti
that I'm going to be focusing on more
today is its SLI compatibility so you I
actually have a second GTX 650 Ti boost
right here also another reference card
design so I'm going to be stacking them
up in two-way SLI running some
benchmarks I'm also going to run some
single card benchmarks with a 650 Ti
boost boost it's boost and even going
deeper than that that's what she said
I'm going to be stacking these two cards
up against a GTX 670 Y 670 well because
one of these cards right now will cost
you about 170 on new ENCOM give or take
10 20 bucks depending on which
manufacturer you get it from so if you
put two of these cards you get two these
cards on Newegg
that's what 340 so if you have 340 bucks
400 bucks lying around you could either
get two of these GTX 650 ti boosts and
put them in SLI or you can get about 1
GTX 670 so I figure if the prices are
about the same between those two
configurations the performance should
theoretically be more or less the same
well that said why don't we get into the
hardware I'm using and so we can see
some out-of-the-box performance once
again or I didn't mention this before
I'm not overclocking at all in this
video my Asus directs you to card is
completely at stock clock frequency I'm
just checking out of the box
performance and we can see how these two
configurations stack up against each
other with the games that I've tested so
let's take a look at the hard way
all right so I'm rockin my personal
system at home so everything within the
Corsair 600 T I've got a 2600 K
overclocked at 4400 megahertz
PhD 68 vPro motherboard 16 gigs of
vengence ram at 1600 mega transfers per
second and I'm not going to bore you
with the rest of the specs there you can
read you can see all the graphics card
specs that I'm using these tests to the
right once again everything's at stock
clock frequencies you want to see any
more specs on these cards any more info
you can check the links in the
description below and once again all
these tests are run at 1920 by 1080 so
the foot for the first test assassin's
creed 3 you can see some very close
neck-and-neck results with the 650 TI
boost in two-way SLI
against these 670 from 50.1 250 1.2 this
is pretty negligible I think it's it's
kind of inconclusive it could be just
margin of error I could run this test
again and see the complete opposite with
a 650 Ti boost and 2 es a lot of pulling
ahead of the 670 so I'm not really going
to get either of these cards a point
right now because I consider this a tie
but here you can see a little bit of
scaling performance pretty decent
amounts it's not the best but it's not
the worst either with a 650 ti boost
going from 36.9 to 50.1 let's see if we
can see any differences in the next test
if there's a clear winner and yes there
is for Battlefield 3 you can see 95
frames per second with a 650 ti boost
into a sli I'm just going to start
calling it boost you guys know what I
mean when I say boops I don't to keep
saying 660ti boost into SLI okay so the
boost in two-way SLI got the 95 frames
per second against 76.2 with the 670
clearly a winner here we have our first
point awarded to the suits job now I
can't stop saying 60 thread we have our
first point awarded to the boost into a
sli and look at that scaling performance
that's just a massive scaling
performance right there that's almost so
that's almost 100 volt there that's
almost 100% scaling so awesome scaling
for the for the boost in two-way SLI and
we have a clear winner here once again 6
with the block with the Boost I ya know
I can't talk right now
borderlands 2 here we go
this is uh definitely a point for the
670 82.6 awesome frames per second right
there and seventy nine point six for the
boost into a thirty nine point one I
mean just look at that scaling guys
that's a crazy scale once again almost
100 percent scaling there with the boost
ease once yeah I forget to mention I
think you guys know by now maximum
temperatures are listed in red next to
the graphics card names and keep in mind
the ACS directs you to really good
cooler it's going to be keeping thermals
really to a minimum there whereas with
the boost reference card designs right
blower style fan and clothes shroud
temps are going to be a little bit
hotter it's actually funny of the single
car temps were slightly higher than the
2-way SLI temps for the boost but you
know who knows strange things are
happening but there you go
there's a point for the 670 so I think
we have a tie right now I think the
first Assassin's Creed 3 was it was a
wash
Battlefield 3 went to the the boost in
two-way SLI and now we have a one point
awarded to the 670 so let's see if we
have a tiebreaker with Crysis 3 which we
kind of do but kind of do not once again
kind of like with Assassin's Creed 3 I
would call this a wash this is pretty
much a negligible difference with barely
one frame basically one frame per second
difference from forty five point five to
forty four point four but look at that
scaling that's over a hundred percent
scaling you guys I don't really say that
or see that often but I guess it does
happen there you go did get pretty darn
hot though with the boost into SLI at 83
degrees press 3 of course you know
killer a GPU killer all those specs
pretty much maxed out sucide from SMA a
a 2x very graphically intensive game the
Boost single car just could not handle
it that's pretty expected with 21 point
3 frames sad face but here again we have
another tie between the boost and to
weigh against the 670 rot Cry 3 we see
the the boost in to a definitely pull
ahead this time of the 670 giving
another point to the boost in two-way so
I think this course two to one right now
and look at that scaling once good guy
scale so good go 31.2 259 just awesome
awesome stuff here let's go to hitman
hitman absolution once again we see the
boost pull ahead into a over the 670 and
now we're starting to see a clear winner
here I think the more tests we go on
we're starting to see you out of the the
boost and two-way SLI is uh is
definitely beating out the 670 on a more
consistent basis right now and scaling
isn't as great as we saw with the last
few tests definitely not close to 100
but still not too shabby at all but 42
to 71 still pretty darn good skyrim if
this is our last real world gaming
benchmark for today you can see it's
almost neck and neck and I almost want
to say this as negligible oh I don't
know is that is that too close too close
to call a clear winner I think I think I
can call that a winner I think I think
that's a point for the boost into way
that's three frames right there and even
though there are really high frame rates
I've worked out a pretty consistent loop
benchmark lube for Skyrim so I feel like
if I ran this test 20 more times I'd
probably get very very very similar
results as the ones you see here so
scaling clearly wasn't that great
probably our least performance with
scaling as we saw with the boost and
two-way but with one hundred and twenty
seven point five frames per second and
you really complain the answer is no so
thirty 3dmark thirty mark 3d mark we can
see once again the boost the boost is
just below in the 670 out of the water I
ran the fire strike demo so the score
you see on the left is the graphics core
for a regular fire strike so with the
6800 over
the GTX 670 s just barely breaking 6000
points definitely a clear winner there
the boost and on to the right we see
need the graphics core for the fire
strike the extreme demo test which is
basically more graphically intensive
version I left out the overall score for
the 3d mark test just because it's a
it's also CPU limited runs a lot of
physics tests which are dependent on the
CPU you want to focus on the graphics
card for for today so I just went with
the graphics core but here with the
fires fire strike extreme demo you can
see that the results here once again are
very negligible and it's just barely
2807 to 28:23 I mean it's there's
there's no clear winner there at all but
with the regular fire strike demo you
can see a massive leap ahead from the
670 going to the boost to ASL ah alright
guys so after taking a look at the
performance results from the benchmarks
I've run today you can see that there is
a clear winner in this little showdown
if you will the GTX 650 Ti boost won
four of those rounds I believe out of
eight I think eight whereas the 670
behind me the Asus directs you to while
it did perform extremely well in those
tests very playable framerates and
nearly everything it did still only only
came out on top in one of those rounds
there were two or three rounds that we
did that there was just no clear winner
the results were too similar so it was
too inconclusive to decide a victory
thurr way but what are your guys
opinions because personally I've always
been a fan of having a single card in my
rig no matter what because I just feel
like it's there's less maintenance
there's less heat there's less power
consumption and I don't have to worry
about scaling performance because not
all cards really scale all that well
with all the games or applications that
you're using them for but in my test
these things the GTX 650 Ti boost into
ASL i scaled beautifully I mean some of
the best scaling performance I've
actually personally ever seen with a
video card and that goes for SLI and
CrossFireX so what do you guys think if
you could get two of these cards for the
same price or even a little bit cheaper
than a GTX 670 and you knew that they
would outperform the 670 a little bit
would you go for them you know or would
you simply avoid them and go for a
single card configuration simply to
avoid the hassle
of having to two GPUs in your system I'd
like to know leave all your thoughts in
the comment section below and yeah
thanks for watching thanks for watching
a give me a like and subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already and until
next time I'll see you guys in the next
