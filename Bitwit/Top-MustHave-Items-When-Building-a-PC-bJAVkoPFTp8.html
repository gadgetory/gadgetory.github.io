Squarespace the quick and easy way to
build a kick-ass website what's up gasps
so you've probably heard someone say
this before or even said it yourself at
some point that all you really need to
build a PC is a screwdriver and yeah
that's true a typical PC build only
requires some simple screwing and
plugging things in with the OL mellon
grabbers but I prefer to call them hands
however after building dozens of pcs
over the years I've added several items
to my arsenal to make the assembly
process that much more fluid and
enjoyable no sponsored products in this
video guys these are all things I've
either found or been recommended by
others and I use them personally on a
regular basis on that note whether
you're a veteran system builder or
taking the steps to building your first
rig may you find some of today's
suggestions helpful as you embark on
your quest for a richer desktop
experience also if anything piques your
interest today please consider using the
affiliate links in the description below
as a way to help support the channel on
that note in no particular order here is
my top list of must-have items when
building a PC now it seems silly to even
include a number two phillips head
screwdriver on this list since it's so
obvious to most folks but i think it
deserves a mention as it is the only
tool that's required for the task at
hand
also not all screwdrivers are created
equal and using the one that you've got
at the dollar store will give you more
problems than it's worth
which is only a dollar but still now
believe it or not the screwdriver I've
been using for nearly a year now was
actually an included accessory for a
thermal write CPU cooler and while this
is just an OEM item that thermal writes
slapped their name on it still turns me
on for several reasons for starters the
magnetic tip is strong as hell so you'll
never fumble another screw into the dark
abyss of your chassis the 6-inch shaft
is the perfect length in my opinion for
general PC building giving you enough
reach when installing your motherboard
and CPU cooler for instance and it has a
sturdy hexagonal grip for greater torque
and comfort since I couldn't find this
exact unit on Amazon I've linked a
similar client screwdriver that's an
inch longer and looks to have a slightly
nicer grip and it's a client screwdriver
so it's just nicer in every way possible
additionally I also use this om pocket
screwdriver that came included with the
HyperX SSD and I promise there are some
things on this list that I did buy
intentionally the unit features
interchangeable magnetic bits and as you
might have guessed is great for
installing SSDs and other small
now instead of having two separate
screwdrivers some folks might prefer a
single multi bit option but that leaves
you without a short screwdriver for
hard-to-reach areas and I personally
find long screwdrivers to be a pain when
installing SSDs another item that's
proven incredibly useful over the years
is my mod right mainboard mod mat which
is one of those things I never knew I
needed until I had one the mod net
provides a 23 by 23 inch anti static
assembly surface for all of your
components just one zap away from never
working again
just ask the HDMI port on my GTX 1084
the win Edition oh wait you can't
because it's dead the matte features a
grounding wire clip and an anti-static
wristband but my favorite thing about
this product is that it's also an anti
scratch surface so I never have to worry
about a chassis getting scuffed up on my
craptastic building table even side
panel windows are safe as long as the
mat is clean and this goes both ways if
you have a nice table to build on the
mod mat also protects your desktop from
getting wrecked by your Hardware screen
directly onto the mat is a motherboard
form factor table and rulers which are
great when plopping down your long rod
for a good measuring it works great for
hard line tubing as well to top it all
off it's made of an insanely rugged
rubber material that's held up
beautifully over the years with not a
single rip tear or puncture hole for
those who need it the mod mat also comes
in an oversized version with twice the
real estate till this day I haven't
found an easier and more effective way
to upgrade my workspace now if there's
one caveat to the mod mat though it's
that it's black which makes it difficult
to see most screws you might place on
it's rubbery surface and that leads us
to the next item on our list which is
the magnetic screw tray not only does it
help to have a designated area for all
your loose screws but the powerful
magnet keeps them in glorious screw
captivity until they're reunited with
their beloved screw hole no conjugal
visits here these affordable trays are
simple and effective for what they do
and can be easily stored on any magnetic
surface when not in use
what they lack however is organization
so I recently picked up this Dell cast
Mt 0 2 magnetic project mat measuring
eleven point seven five inches by nine
inches the mat is divided up into
squares and features a dry erase surface
for labeling your screws during the
disassembly process now unless you're
new to PC building you can probably
figure out which screws go where without
the help of this item but if you're
relatively new to custom water-cooling
like myself this mat can be a godsend
for organizing and labeling all the
little screws for your
GPU coolers and water blocks on the
downside the MT 0-2 is intended for
smart phone and laptop disassembly so
the magnetic surface isn't quite strong
enough to hold larger thumb screws for
instance but the thick non-slip foam
backing aids in the prevention of loss
groups this along with the standard
screw tray make a great combo for
keeping all your little things in order
now every now and then when building a
PC I'll have to reseat my CPU cooler for
some unexpected reason leaving the base
plate and my CPU a sticky goopy mess but
until some genius invents edible thermal
paste that I can just lick off of my
Hardware sounds suggestive I'll continue
using this thermal compound remover kit
from Arctic silver the Arctic lean kit
uses a two-step process including a
remover and purifier solution apply a
couple drops of the remover to any
greasy surface and magically wipe the
goop away with ease then rub in a drop
or two of the purifier to prep the
surface for a fresh application of
thermal compound this helps to prevent
flash corrosion on copper heat sinks
while removing any residue left by the
remover and thanks to its refreshing
citrus scent this arctic link it also
gets my award for the best smelling
object in a PC geeks room though
nominations were slim these bottles have
kept all my thermal mating surfaces in
pristine condition for years and they
work great on hardware too another
problem I've had with PC building in the
past is unboxing a brand new chassis
only to deface it seconds later with my
oily fingerprints for years I'd been
using a pair of these fabric gloves
which were working out fine until they
zapped that HDMI port on my GTX 1080
after receiving several recommendations
for nitrile gloves I finally bought my
first box which has already been a
worthwhile investment the gloves are non
conductive so no more fried electronics
and they have a nice grip to them so I
can handle cases inside panel windows
without leaving behind a crime scene of
fingerprints unfortunately the gloves
are just a preventative measure and
since it's just not practical to wear
them throughout the entire build process
this four pack of extra-large microfiber
cleaning cloths from magic fiber is a
great solution for wiping off any eye
sores on your chassis if you're still
using the tiny cloth that came with your
eyeglasses to clean your case window
these 16 by 16 inch squares are calling
your name they're so big I even used
them for my 32 inch monitor and my 55
inch TV best of all they're extremely
gentle leaving zero scratches or streaks
on even the cheapest case windows I have
come across and trust me I've seen
some pretty bad ones winding down our
list of helpful building appliances are
a few things to aid in the ever so
crucial task of cable management an
assortment of zip ties in various sizes
and the pack of reusable velcro straps
can go a long way most PC cases these
days come included with a number of
these restraints but they're usually not
the size I need or they're simply not
enough of them so having my own supply
ensures that no cable goes untidy zip
ties are great for binding cables as
tightly as possible to maximize space
conservation while velcro straps allow
for flexibility when adding or removing
cables to the bunch yes I just explained
to you what zip ties work as a final pro
tip for cable management I'd also
recommend a small pair of wire cutters
to snip off any excess a zip tie clutter
so there you have it guys those are
pretty much all the tools and trinkets I
like to use when building my pcs but if
there's anything you'd like to add to
this list be sure to share it in the
