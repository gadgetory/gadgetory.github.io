to you by be quiet cable mod verda gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info be quiet
hell yeah we're here to be quiet booth
obviously and look at this this looks a
little bit familiar but a little bit
different this is a dark Bass Pro 900 in
white white through and through on the
outside on the inside I really like the
fact that even the motherboard tray is
fully white now you might be asking
yourself how can I get one of these
right now well you might have to wait
first off until after summer maybe
August timeframe before these become
available and you're also going to be
pretty quick on the draw because be
quiet only releasing 2000 of these
worldwide in the ether so you're gonna
have to be really quick and try to get
one early on so very exclusive product
right here of course this is already
going to have the exact same internal
layout everything else is exactly the
same as the dark based pro but it's just
in white and it actually looks
phenomenal they have a full system way
over there I'll do some b-roll shots of
that it looks absolutely incredible go
ahead and keep an eye out for the dark
base Pro white
I gotta tell you my wife who the hell is
that who the hell oh oh it's Chris we're
going to forget next up we've got silent
loop we got the silent loop this is a
the same actual radiator except it's a
three hundred and sixty millimeter
instead of the 240 that I installed in
the giveaway prize not too long ago in
my last free copy text vlog and as a
fantastic little cooler I haven't done
any sort of testing with it yet but you
can rest assured the quality is
top-notch
of course you get triple fans 120s right
here be quiet has extremely quiet and
effective air cooling and static
pressure fans for you to use coil tubing
are right okay not again not my favorite
but you know we're working on it we're
getting there though the water block at
the very least is very nice it's kind of
got this sort of brushed aluminum finish
absolutely fantastic one thing to note
here is that this is not going to be
available in the US at least for now
tentatively so if you're in the Europe
or Asia area you can pick one of these
up relatively easily
next up s FX L power supply look at this
fully modular 80 plus gold certified a
very quiet fan right there in the middle
and if you look over here just just a
really small profile it does come
included with an adapter bracket so you
could mount this in say a full ATX
chassis if you wanted to five to six
hundred watts of freaking power here
which is perfectly fine actually unless
you're doing like SLI or crossfire which
is granted not as common these days with
a better power efficiency of newer
generations and graphics cars you don't
really need 750 850 watt units anymore
and so if you can actually fit one of
those in a small form-factor case this
might be a perfect power supply for your
next mini ITX built shadow rock tf2 this
is also one of those units that's not
going to be fully available in the US
top down coolers are not very popular
these days
it is sort of a niche market so that's
good that could be why we're not seeing
a US release here but in case you're
interested you do get a nice big 140
millimeter fan at the top looks like it
has full Ram clearance I'm just going to
go out go out and say it right now looks
like zero ram interference whatsoever
that's really nice and then we've also
got some power supplies over here this
is actually the straight power 11 which
is a new brand new brand new unit you
can see here just there's absolutely no
wires on the internal side so if you
look over here if they're older model
you can actually see there's a lot of
wiring here and that does sort of block
some of the passive airflow or even the
active airflow that goes through the
unit itself and that could actually lead
to higher temperatures and less
reliability
a long period of use so that's really
nice also you get the fully modular
units I don't think we've actually seen
a fully modular design from be quiet on
the power supply side just yet so it's
actually really nice to see here that
they've implemented that of course you
get world-class quiet and efficiency
performance and what was the other thing
80 plus gold certification in the
various wattages of for turn 55 56 57 58
15 and a thousand watts siloing three
fan siloing three these are the best
fans ever oh look I can kind of kind of
spin it almost it's like a fidget
spinner
who's not no no never mind what do these
things what are these are these condoms
the hell are these gummi bears oh geez
go huh alright guys it's going to do it
for be quiet gummy bears are so good
thank you so much to my sponsors be
quiet
Berta gear table mod and EVGA for
sponsoring this cryptic copy 2x 2017
stay tuned for more coverage coming
really soon on billet that's a lot of a
lot of going goes oh my god it's so good
there's no good let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
