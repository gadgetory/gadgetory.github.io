booted how's it going all thank you for
being here thank you for joining I just
finished my my bourbon so I think I'm
all prepped for the show that's really
the only criteria that needs to be met
in order to host a successful live
stream so to speak welcome welcome
everyone this is booted season for the
final episode this is week four we're in
the this is the finale the grand finale
where all of the finalists of three
finalists that were chosen over the last
few weeks are going to be pitted
head-to-head against each other for the
grand prize of five hundred dollars in
their choice of an Amazon or steam gift
card so far everyone who's one booted
the last three winners of the series
have all gone with the amazon gift card
which i suppose is probably what I would
go with two it seems like the more
favorable option however if you're you
know just really into games and you're
already you don't need anything on
Amazon maybe you're Steve if you're
Steve OMG and you just you by like 30
steam games a day maybe maybe maybe
we'll have one winner who picks the
steam gift card but so far it's all
amazon welcome guys it's so good to to
be here so good to have you here I'm
excited I'm really excited about this
final episode and and hopefully you guys
have your voting fingers ready because
it's going to be a tough choice I was
looking at the contenders earlier today
and thinking who I would vote for
personally and I think I have mine
figured out however it took me a while
to get to that conclusion because
they're they're all such really good
rigs they're very well-composed their
finalists for a reason put it that way
but before we dive into it just a couple
announcements I will be flying out this
Wednesday actually thursday morning like
1250 am myself and my wife Heather wifey
sauce we're going to be catching a plane
to frickin China we're going to be going
to China Macau for an AMD press event
wonder what they're going to be talking
about there I can't really give away too
many details but we're
to be going to to freaking China and
then we're going to be hopping over to
type a couple days later to cover
computex 2016 I will be traveling with
Paul from Paul's hardware as well and
we're going to be kind of sticking
together helping each other film and
whatnot all of our computex coverage so
stay tuned for that there's going to be
a lot of Awesome coverage for this event
on both mine and poles channels so very
looking forward to that so just just a
forewarning or you're gonna be seeing
quite a bit of coverage i would say
expect anywhere from two to three videos
a day at the event um maybe more who
knows but yeah it should be should be
good stuff and I mean custom I'm looking
forward to all the adding board partners
and their GTX 1080s maybe maybe we'll
even get some 10 70s in there who knows
should be some exciting stuff so lots of
good things to look forward to let's go
ahead and thank our sponsor really quick
for making the show possible which is
cable mod this is their second
consecutive season of sponsorship
because they're awesome guys if you
haven't checked out cable mod products
at all now might be the time to do so
they've got cables obviously as you
could probably suspect from the name and
they've also got really good these cable
mod y beam LED strips i worth the
configurator page right here and they
actually just released a new type of
sleeping there mod flex leaving before
or I'm sorry their mod mesh I forgive me
mod flex is what they already had but
now they have mod mesh which is a
special type of PT sleeping and i'll be
talking more about this during the
voting round so be sure to stay tuned
for that there's links in the
description if you want to check out any
of their products really good stuff I
have cable mod products in probably four
maybe three or four of my 11 pcs that I
have currently operational so I am a
personal believer in their products now
let's get on to the important things the
pcs the shows about damn it hopefully
everything is also sounding good i'm
going to check the stream really quick
all you guys in chat alright people are
not rioting so that means audio is
apparently coming in clear enough
it sounds okay news on all right all
right those really expensive microphone
so hopefully it sounds awesome okay
let's talk about our first contender who
is Michael McHale I'm gonna say McHale
because it's more original in his
evolved ATX we had a quite a few evolved
ATX Chessie's in this season of booted
and it's not too hard to see why it's a
beautiful case and very functional as
well rockin at core i7 6700 k so this is
again the high-end season of Buddha
we're going to be seeing some some heavy
hitters here let's take a look at the
inside see all right so he's got two gtx
980 eyes reference design but they are
you know rebranded under zotac of course
gotta suz 170 deluxe ATX motherboard
beautiful board for not too much not too
much moolah and you've also got he's
also got 16 gigs kingston savage ddr4 a
3000 decent storage set up everything's
looking good here that's a also a
reasonable power supply for the amount
of hardware he's got connected here so
first off right off the bat what I
really like about this system overall is
its first of all it's just ridiculously
clean the cable sleeving is on point
they are trained quite nicely they're
not a hundred percent like fully fully
you know super tight and crispy is what
I would call them but they are very
straight and aligned got the cable combs
on there and he also has really nice
just composition of everything I really
love the the large be quiet cooler I
think it looks absolutely beautiful that
that brushed finished there and he's
also modded out the the geforce gtx
logos all the branding the leds that are
on the the 980 TI is there are buy stock
green and you can see here they are
clearly white so that's that's just some
extra love and dedication that he put in
there along with a very nice EVGA bridge
SLI bridge to top things off he's also
got a an SSD thats hanging down there on
the lower right corner I
really like that placement I can't tell
if it's the camera lens or if it's just
actually the ssds a little bit crooked I
can't really tell it's probably just the
the Boeing of the lens however cable
management is on point all around here
super clean set up we have a shot of the
cpu cooler a little bit closer so you
can see here that it is is in fact a non
passive cooler at first I thought it was
a passive cooler and then I realized oh
there's a fan and wedged in between two
of those large heat sinks beautiful
stuff everything just is very very well
coordinated you know I like I like black
and white builds Paul's a Arctic Panther
is one of my favorite black and white
builds personally but this one for
air-cooled is definitely does the theme
justice and you've got a white fan in
the background there which also looks
nice but one thing we don't do in the
first three weeks of a season of booted
is show off the contenders cable
management that's only something we do
in round four when the stakes are really
at their highest peak so why don't we go
ahead and take a look at what Michael is
packing all right so now while the front
end of his system is very nice and tidy
it looks to me like he cable managed the
rest of his system with a blindfold on
handcuffed while under the influence of
mescaline this is very this is very
erratic and and you can kind of see why
when you're dealing with a case like the
evolved ATX because there is just so
much room for cable management and I
feel like the more space you're given to
route cables and things like that
sometimes the less work you put into it
because it's just that easy you don't
really need to try that's what a lot of
cases full at least a mid tower and full
tower cases these days are really
pioneering is just ease of cable
management and not really needing to
tidy anything up on the backside however
here we can see michael has done just
that he is just kind of thrown
everything in there
at least on this backside and we can see
quite a bit of spaghetti yes quaaludes
are delicious so you know take that for
what you will but the the main the main
squeeze here is this side in particular
and it does look quite quite quite tasty
if I do say so myself I can't remember
if you can see the yeah I believe you
can see the power supply through the
window on the side panel of this case
and if that is the case it's not meant
to be punny at all I would probably
remove this is just me personally I'm a
stickler when it comes to color
coordination and if there's just a one
bit of splash of color that doesn't
really match what the rest of the system
I it just drives my OCD crazy so I would
personally remove the HX 1000 sticker
there on the power supply but that's
just me it's such a minor thing that to
most people they wouldn't even think
about it but I've got OCD and I had to
speak my mind because I'm hosting the
show so forgive me forgive me for that
open minded this or closed mindedness
depending on how you look at it let's
move on to Daphne Daphne was our week
two finalists and when you first look at
this case it doesn't strike you as a
high-end chassis because it's really not
so thermaltake g42 commander you don't
really see this case too often in
high-end builds but according to Daphne
and the little personal message that she
wrote me unless Daphne is a dude of
course that could always be true this is
a this case holds sentimental value to
her or him or it we don't know and
that's uh I can respect that because
there is something more to PC building
than just a bunch of inanimate objects
coming together and forming a functional
computer there is sentimental value that
can be attached to certain parts or
score rigs out as a whole and I like the
fact that she didn't you know just just
go with the latest and greatest high-end
chassis of 2016 when building the system
she stuck to her roots there's something
that about this case that means a lot to
her and I can respect that
and while it's not the most high-end and
blingy of all cases it does do a nice
job of holding all her hardware in here
she's got two gtx 980 s in sli a 47 90 k
with a corsair h100 5 cooler those
beautiful Dominator Platts which I just
love and again we see another fancy sli
bridge here from EVGA she's got fully
sleeved cables as well for a 24-pin her
pcie beautifully sleeve in white and
they are full power supply cables
they're not extensions which I also
think adds a nice touch of class to the
whole thing and the cable management is
just is very lovely very lovely you can
also see that there's an SSD resting on
top of her hard drive cage there which
I'm totally fine with I actually like
that a lot SSDs you can get a lot more
clever and creative with where you mount
them because they don't have any moving
parts of them you're gonna have to worry
about any kind of noise or vibration and
she's definitely taking advantage of
that fact also beautiful motherboard
love the thermal armor on the
saber-tooth series at z97 bling 32 gigs
of RAM think I already mentioned that
and then here's a money shot given us a
nice little inside look there and i
believe yes these are the thermaltake
white LED ring fans now the ring fans I
have not checked out personally I might
have some on the way actually I think I
hit up thermaltake not too long ago as I
hey I've been seeing a lot of these ring
fans with your name on it on booted they
just keep popping up everywhere I want
to check them out so hopefully I'll be
able to get some of those in test amount
for you guys do a fun little video
particularly for their unique LED
arrangement on them and we do have a
shot here of what that looks like in
action just a fully 360 degree led this
this looks so much better to me in my
opinion than having the LEDs shine
through through the actual blades of the
fan to have a ring around them is just
such a smart move and it really adds a
lot of a lot of coolness to this to this
build I might add however let's let's
take a look at daphne's cable management
see what she's got hiding under the hood
alright actually this is pretty good I
would say um yeah Jeets I like it yeah
everything's ready nice and neat she's
got kind of individual sections that
she's going to and nothing's really
overlapping too much over each other
which really helps you get that side
panel on a lot easier um it's a really
nice job I like how you kind of also
grappled all the cables together in the
in the top left corner behind your five
and a quarter inch Bay think that was a
smart move as well very good use of the
tie-down points there's a plenty of zip
ties I think people are afraid sometimes
to use zip ties justjust I use like way
too many zip ties personally it's a it's
a shitshow anytime I have to like remove
a component because I got a like clip
off you know 30 zip ties to remove a
freaking I don't know video card or
something like that but really nice job
here I've been Dallas thank you very
much for the donation Daphne she is a he
oh sorry i I'm sorry Daphne i I'm just
conditioned to think that Daphne is a
woman's name because i am a i'm a very
arrogant a very ignorant man and i
apologize you're just you're also not as
cool now for being a dude i don't have
like a secret cyber crush on you anymore
like I used to but that's cool your pc
still kicks ass so um that's that's what
counts here but thank you again abend oz
for the donation there and let's move on
to our last contender here who is luke
luke with the NZXT h2 beautiful modding
here done by luke and this has kind of a
been a work in progress for the last few
years for him you can see he's got a
3770k and which tells you he's been
working on it for quite some time and
he's got that kind of approach where the
pcs never really done he's just been
kind of making iterations to it over the
years resulting in this beautiful system
inside of a NZXT h2 that he's fully
tricked-out painted modded put a decal
on there to make it like us the stark
industries like a stark
Tony Stark type theme looks really cool
he's also got two gtx 980 s and sli
again reference design and it looks like
he's also whitewashed those uh
previously green branding logos on the
sides of those cards which i always
think is a cool smart move corsair h 1
10 i GT so you've got some liquid
cooling for a cpu the one thing i will
say here as beautiful as this system is
I really want there to be in the EVGA
sli bridge on there I mean Daphne Daphne
figured it out Michael Michael hit hit
it on the head Luke Luke you need to get
an EVGA SLI bridge or some kind of rigid
SLI bridge on there at least because I
was dealing with that same floppy
connector that ribbon style bridge on a
hotline for a while and it was the bane
of my existence for quite some time and
my life has been so much better ever
since I made the switch you should do
the same those those ocz vector ssds are
also really killer those vector 150 s I
think that just matches perfectly with
the theme here the other critique I had
was with the the actual cable sleeving I
would have liked to see a bit more white
in the sleeving particularly with your
your your Phoebus solo sound card and
the the graphics cards I think that
would have been pretty nice pretty mess
but I also like how you you also
informed me in your submission that you
modded the top part of the case to house
a 240 millimeter radiator which is how
you got that h1 h1 10 i GT in there
which i think is really cool adding not
just a mod for looks but for function as
well let me give you some lower
temperatures when overclocking and
you've also done away with the the very
prominent drive cage that is originally
in the h2 and instead you've got two
hard drives that are just mounted in the
lower right corner of your chassis and
while that really clears up a lot of
space and more room for you to add
things like those two 120 millimeter
fans a little bit concerned that there
might be some kind of vibration noise
down there just because I don't know if
you have anything actually in
in the drives it looks like they're just
straight up maybe velcroed on top of
each other I guess that would minimize
some of it if you had velcro in between
but that is a slight concern I do like
how you have blue fans at the top there
you've got a different kind of fan at
the back it's a bit fenix can't I can't
tell which fan xazhar at the top you
guys you guys in chat know which fans
those are but perfectly matched blue
that blue hue on those blades that you
painted I'm guessing you painted them
match really well with your cables and
the rest of the system so well done on
that and it looks like you've got some
optional photos here so we get a nice
letter look with the front panel kind of
a swung open and you can see that he's
also done some mod work at the front
with carbon fiber he's got carbon fiber
lining the side of the the chassis as
well I can see those three fans sitting
pretty looks beautiful man and also this
is a this is killer the full tempered
glass side panel so really well done on
that Luke but let's what about your
cable management though we still have
not seen the underbelly of this rig or
if there are any skeletons in your
closet let's go ahead and see what that
looks like alright Wow well then what
hell is not expecting to find ketchup
and mustard in this build even on the
back side however you've concealed it
quite nicely albeit with a bit of chaos
it does look very it looks messy I'll
just I'll just come out come right out
and say it it looks pretty messy back
here but you do have very good use of
zip ties again not being afraid to use
zip ties is always key to good cable
management and it looks like you haven't
really held back there too much there is
a lot of crossover i would say between
cables there's a lot of cables that are
just overlapping each other which adds a
little bit more or a little less
breathing room for your side panel to go
on although I'm sure that you can get it
on just just fine again cable management
on the back side some people just don't
Eve
and consider making it look nice because
no one's going to see it anyway no one
you know on the on the reg on average no
one will ever even see that side of your
system however there is a certain sense
of pride that goes into good cable
management regardless of who's seeing it
because at the end of the day you
personally the Builder know that it's
there and I think there is something to
be said about good cable management
throughout the entirety of your system
but that is it those are all the
contenders so right now I'm going to go
ahead and just scroll through each of
these contenders so this is a week
finalists week one finalist Michael week
two finalists Daphne and week three
finalists Luke right about now you
should be seeing a link being posted in
chat by one of my beautiful mods we've
got spider fan we got Mike thematic geek
and we've got cell processing those are
my 3 mods i'm not sure if they're all
still here hopefully at least one of
them are by the way thank you guys the
three of you for for modding booted I
really appreciate all the work you guys
do for just kind of being on call um you
know i'm not i'm not paying you guys you
know other than with other than with
love of course but i really do just want
to give you guys a huge shout out for
all the help that you've up offered this
series and me and and and the viewers so
right about now you should be seeing a
link being posted by one of them and
that will take you to a web page that
looks sort of like this where you can
vote on which pc that we just looked at
today deserves the grand prize of five
hundred dollars so again we've got
numero uno as Michael dos with Daphne
and today's with Sir Luke alright guys
think about this carefully I really hope
you do because um five hundred bucks is
a lot to just be like ah he should get
it because he had the best yeah the
fastest graphics cards or he had the
most expensive case he gets the five
hundred dollars really think about the
composure of each of these builds and
the love and care thought that went into
them in the meantime while you guys
think very hard about that
I'm going to go ahead and talk about our
sponsor one more time it's cable nod
cable mod and just a little bit more
information on their new type of
sleeving the the mod mesh again it is PT
based it's a much more rigid than their
current their existing mod flex leaving
and because it's PT based it says it's
kind of like a nylon eggs are familiar
with that nylon slaving it looks really
really clean and smooth and kind of
shiny a little bit the colors are more
bright or more bright and actually more
vibrant than what you'd find on
something like the mod flex or like a
fabrics leaving and they're also going
to be offering cable mots also offering
it in UV reactive options so if you want
to do a UV lit up system or something
like that it's a really nice way to just
I don't know bling out your bling out
your rig and they're also offering it
with full power supply kits so not just
extensions but you can do this you do a
mod mesh for an entire frickin power
supply and they've got a couple brands
here so it looks like you can just
choose any of these I know at first they
they launched with only a few available
i think it was like EVGA and corsair
we're the only ones available but now it
looks like don't quote me on this but it
looks like you can pretty much choose
any of these options and and get your
nice nylon sleeving there of course if
you don't want to go the full power
supply cable route you can use custom
extensions as well in the the nylon the
dial on option boom and for those of you
who haven't seen the cable motor cable
mod configurator yet it's pretty amazing
you can select pretty much any of the
popular most used cables that you might
need in your system you can add it they
can there's a slider Oh a link length
slider goes anywhere from 200
millimeters to 600 millimeters so you
can get the perfect length of cable that
you need so that you don't end up with a
bunch of excess length to kind of find a
place for or stash away behind your
system and you ensure that it's also
long enough after you know measuring
properly the the gaps in your system so
I'm going to do three hundred and fifty
millimeters continue to the next step
and here
you're abroad too little diagram let me
go ahead and zoom this in a bit so you
can get a better idea here alright so
you have all these colors to choose from
they have a ton of colors blood red
black brown carbon dark grey silver
purple blue or I'm sorry blue light blue
green light green yellow orange and red
and white so you basically just select a
color carbon all right you can do a
little carbon there and then you can do
I don't know something else if you
wanted to some light green there oh yeah
don't don't actually do this color
combination because this looks horrible
I would not I would not recommend it but
isn't that cool you guys can you can do
whatever you set your mind to do
whatever you set your mind to it's
pretty awesome so if you guys want to
check this out go ahead and check the
link in the description it's all there
it's all good stuff but yeah thank you
again cable mod for sponsoring booted
season full and on that note cue
dramatic voting music because uh we've
got a decision to make ladies and
gentlemen at the beginning of this
season we had 15 pcs and now we have
three and only one of those three will
be claimed will be declared a booted
champion who's it gonna be you got
Michael we got Daphne I figured out he
he's not is that he's not a she that was
an important note and then Luke alright
so which one of these three is going
home with five hundred dollars and which
of these two will be booted and sent
home with nothing let's find out
Oh Luke damn Luke with 43-percent just
trailing behind him is Daphne with
37-percent very close match up very
close call Michael unfortunately you
were in last place for twenty percent
but hey you still made it to Round four
and that ain't bad Luke I am your father
I mean I'm not your father but please
call me daddy no I'm sorry I don't know
I'm saying now thank you very much Luke
or a congratulations Luke on your big
victory here and I think it's well
deserved you seriously put so much time
into this I just know from building
hotline I can tell you put at least 100
hours plus maybe 200 hours into the
state it's freaking phenomenal dude it's
one of the most unique and just original
and just beautiful systems I've seen in
a long time and I'm really glad that the
audience chose you so congrats again and
well done audience for voting for Luke
and maintaining the integrity of the
channel whatever little bit is left and
that's going to conclude this season of
booted don't go anywhere because I have
a quick announcement here season 5 of
booted will be premiering on july 4th
this is the custom water cooled edition
guys not the custom water cooled edition
guys but it's the custom water cooled
edition comma guys be weird if there is
a bunch of guys that were just like
we're like custom water cooled guys
anyway for me or shall I fourth remember
there's no booted for next month in in
June because i'm going to be a computech
so if you want to head back screw you
find your way back to the channel come
july 4th its independence day ain't that
hard to remember and pop in at around
five-thirty p.m. pacific and you'll be
watching the very first episode of this
custom water cooled edition of the show
it should be exciting i have already
downloaded all of the submissions that
were sent and for this next season and
very promising stuff you're going to be
you guys are going to be impressed for
sure so stay tuned for that again thank
you to the mods cell processing mike the

near me I'd buy you a shot right now and
we all drink it and probably do
something stupid that we regret later
but anyway thank you guys for watching
really appreciate you guys stopping in
and and stay tuned for computex coverage
coming really soon i also have maybe one
tech video should be launching sometime
this week before then before i hop on a
plane so also be sure to catch that as
well guys I love you have a good rest of
your evening or day or whatever and I'll
