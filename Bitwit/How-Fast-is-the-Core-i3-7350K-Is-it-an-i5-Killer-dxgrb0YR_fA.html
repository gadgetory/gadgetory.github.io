channel today I am SuperDuper excited
because I have a brand new chip from
Intel that just arrived on my doorstep
yesterday after I came back from CES
this is the core i3 73 50k and it's very
exciting processor right now because
it's a core i3 chip that is fully
unlocked it has an unlock multiplier and
it supports hyper threading this is
really exciting stuff because up until
now we have not seen a chip of this
caliber the thing that comes closest to
it as of late is the pentium g 32:58
which was the anniversary edition chip
from intel that kind of paid homage to
the old days of overclocking when you
could buy a budget chip and still push
the clock speed quite far so the pentium
g 32:58 had a lot of things going for it
for one it was dirt cheap $75 MSRP what
there abouts
which is way cheaper than this $180
which is still fairly budget oriented
but yeah it was dirt cheap and also a
great overclocker I was seeing review
websites hit or get 1 gigahertz gains
with relatively little effort the other
problem though with the G 32:58 is that
it was not hyper threaded it only had
two cores and that was it so it did
while it did really well in single
threaded applications it kind of took a
backseat when it came to multi-threaded
programs like rendering for example and
I'm curious to see how much how far the
hyper threading actually goes for a chip
like the 73 50k here the other thing is
that the the G 32 58 didn't have the
most cash it had three megabytes of l3
cache compared to fora on this chip
which doesn't seem like a huge boost but
it actually is 33% increase in cache
means there's more data that can be
stored to the internal cache here for
really quick access and that could be a
huge bottleneck if you don't have enough
of it so I'm also curious to see how
that affects our gaming performance and
our rendering performance in today's
tests now the other thing to note about
this guy is that it comes 4.2 gigahertz
out of the box and again with KB Lake
family I'm expecting at least 4.9
possibly 5 gigahertz on a manual
overclock in the BIOS which would be
pretty sweet
again that would help us a lot with
single-threaded applications but when it
comes to multi-threaded apps we're gonna
see how far these extra threads these
four threads can actually take us and
we're gonna be comparing this chip to
the core i5 6600 cave that's only
because I don't physically have a 7600
hey on hand which is the skylake equip
I'm sorry the the KB Lake equivalent to
the 6600 K both core i5s
however the performance difference
between those chips should be very
marginal and so comparing this to the
6600 K should still give us a pretty
good idea of how close we get in terms
of performance coming from a 180 dollar
I 3 to a 250 dollar I 5 within kv light
now a final note of mentioned before we
dive into the testing hardware is that
this chip is only rocking a 60 watt TDP
so it's fairly power efficient and on
top of that when we're dealing with only
2 cores on the die we actually have a
lot less heat to deal with inside of the
overall package which is going to be
really good for potentially overclocking
we have a bit more thermal Headroom in
that in that degree pun intended and we
also don't have as much requirement in
terms of our CPU cooler so you might
actually even be able to save a little
bit money get getting like a 25 $30
cooler to slap on this guy as opposed to
maybe having a water cooling solution or
an AIO
on top of a core i5 for example if you
are going to be overclocking on that
note so let's go ahead and take a look
at the testing hardware that we have
over there because lord knows I don't
want to spoil you guys with my beautiful
face all day so this be the test
incentive that we be rockin make a yar
so you can see here we've got a brand
new z2 70 bore this is the Asus tough Z
270 mark 1 very nice-looking motherboard
by the way that is gonna be rockin of
course gtx 1060 that is a founders
edition from nvidia now this is running
stock this is gonna be running stock
throughout the entire video as far as
memory goes we've got 16 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance lpx that is the low profile
stuff at 3200 megahertz and right now
we're actually got that I got the 6600 K
in there humming it's purring purring
like a tiger it's 4.60 Hertz over
collect and we've got it being cooled by
a Corsair h100 I GTX v2 that's that's
that's right right I think they're the
names on their coolers get more and more
confusing we've also got a 750 watt
power supply the HX series from Corsair
this is the original power supply used
in my first ever build back in 2011 but
it's still working power supply it works
pretty nice and then we've got a 1
terabyte crucial MX 200 right here with
our OS and games and everything else so
that's pretty much what we're looking at
right now guys you can see I've got you
in heaven just kind of warming things up
right now on the
test fit and let's go ahead and just
rock rock this shit I'm gonna go run all
the tests we've got three three or four
games and synthetic or two and some
rendering tests so I'm gonna fire those
up and then I'm gonna go ahead and just
swap out the 73 50k I'm gonna put the 73
50 where is it where is it oh god I
thought I lost you
so scared said not gonna do that again
after the 60 600k gets all tested we're
gonna go ahead and slide in the 73 50k
I'm gonna go ahead and overclock the
crap out of it and I'm gonna circle back
to you guys and let you know what kind
of clock speeds I was able to get away
with this beautiful core i3 oh yeah oh
yeah it's coming it's gone
oh alright y'all the 73 50k has been
installed I have given it a hefty
overclock to 5 gigahertz holy moly that
is pretty sweet the the voltage that I
dialed in was 1.4 - very similar to some
other review sites that have already
posted the reviews on this chip it's
reading the core of Eid the core vid is
1.1 goes to it fluctuates between 1.1
and 1.2 as of now we are rendering in W
Premiere Pro I threw in a five-minute 4k
clip at 32 megabits per second bitrate
and you can see here we've got all four
we got we got both chorus and on all
four threads that are just freakin maxed
out at 100% so this is taxing the CPU
pretty much across the board and you can
see the rendering going down going down
right there pretty smoothly that is a
very small sneak preview of a sketch
that I've got coming out very soon but
yeah so far it's looking pretty good the
overclock is just absolutely beastly and
of course when you're dealing with fewer
cores it allows you to hit higher clock
speeds on those said cores so that's why
a lot of these villages the overclocking
world records you'll see that the
highest frequencies hit are on single
core now if you guys look over here in
Hardware monitor you can see that this
is still an engineering sample for sure
it's not even being picked up it just
says Intel processor there's no SKU
available and because of that it's only
showing our frequencies and our
utilization there is no temperature
readout here so unfortunately I don't
really I can't give you guys any
temperatures right now I can assure you
that they're probably not going to be as
hot as the 6600 K but so far the PC
hasn't caught on fire over there so I
think we're in good shape I'm going to
finish rendering out this video we're
going to run the rest of our benchmarks
and we'll be ready to compare the rows
to our core i5 and draw some conclusions
about our 7350 k alright y'all the
results are in let's go ahead and see
how these two cpus stack up against each
other in our tests the first test was
3dmark fire strike extreme it's a very
consistent benchmark from run to run and
so with the core i3 we got a score of
five thousand five hundred and
fifty-eight and the core i5 6600 k
received a score of five thousand six
hundred and fifty six there's really not
too much of a wide gap there so that's a
good start for the core i3 so far but in
my experience 3dmark fire strike does
not always tell the full story in terms
of real-world gaming performance so the
first game that we actually tested was
doom and all the tests that I ran for
gaming anyway were tested at 1920 by
1080 with ultra settings doom saw a
frame rate of 103 on both systems
whether it was rockin the core i3 or the
core i5 we got 103 frames per second on
average which really excited me at first
because if we can see similar
performance in games between the 73 50k
and something like the 6600 K then why
the hell aren't we just buying I threes
at this point and just saying screw the
suit 7600 K because there's hardly any
bottlenecking going on but before I got
too excited I did run Metro last light
and saw that there was a bit of a bit
bit more gap there we went from 79
frames per second with the core i3 to 84
FPS with our core i5 and that's still
really not too bad that's a 6% slowdown
and I would gladly take that performance
hit in order to save you know 50 60 70
dollars on a core i3 chip however in our
last test which was grand theft auto 5
and I always use this test when I'm
benchmarking CPUs and doing CPU
comparisons because it is such a CPU
bound and intensive game not to say it's
not GPU bound but it definitely taxes
the CPU very heavily and that was quite
a kicker in the gonads let me tell you
we went from 48 frames per second on the
core i3 to 60 FPS with our 6600 K a 20%
slowdown going from 4 physical cores to
2 physical cores with hyper-threading
yes there will be bottlenecking with the
core i3 with this particular CPU in
certain games so this could be an issue
if you're trying to squeeze the most
performance out of your GPU and don't
want to get bottleneck by your processor
maybe the core i3
isn't so hot 100% of the time in-game
let's see how it didn't rendering though
our first test in this category was
handbrake which is very much a
multi-threaded application for rendering
videos in the video I used the sample
clip was a three or four minute
screen capture of gta5 rendered out at
1920 by 1080 using h.264 encoding and
the core i5 6600 K render that in 1
minute and 58 seconds just under two
minutes and the core i3 rendered out the
same clip in 2 minutes and 46 seconds so
we saw almost a 33% slowdown going from
the core i5 to the core i3 finally with
the more strenuous rendering test which
you guys already got a peak of Adobe
Premiere Pro rendering out a 4 minute
I'm sorry a 4k five minute clip at 32
megabits per second target bitrate
yielded 11 minutes and 18 seconds for
the core i5 to render that out whereas
the core i3 rendered it in 16 minutes
and 13 seconds going from 11 to 16
minutes simply because we don't have the
same number of physical cores and I
think the moral of the story here is
threads do not equal course having a
dual core processor with hyper threading
is by no stretch any match for a quad
core processor with 4 physical cores
when it comes to multi-threaded
applications as clearly indicated by
these render tests so what I would take
away from all of this ladies and
gentlemen is that if you have the money
to spend on a core i5 unlocked CPU
absolutely go for it do not try to skimp
or cut corners by getting the 73 50k
core i3 because it does not simply
compete in the same space which makes a
lot of sense if you think about it
there's no way in hell that Intel would
make a 180 dollar chip perform even
close to its core i5 counterpart because
I would essentially make it obsolete no
one would buy the core i5 they could
just buy something that works just as
well for 70 bucks less and I think
another angle to approach this from is
if you did only have say 180 to 200
dollars for your CPU does it make sense
to go from the core i3 7350 K to the
core i5 7400 sorry someone's opening the
garage door there's nothing I can do
just keep rolling the core i5 7400 is a
quad core chip but it is locked it
doesn't have any potential headroom to
go any further than it's three gigahertz
out of the box frequency I think the
best choice between those two CPUs is
going to heavily depend on
your needs as a user so if you're going
to be using multi-threaded applications
frequently or you're rendering videos
out constantly then I would say go for
the entry-level core i5 because at the
end of the day even if you can't
overclock it having 4 physical cores is
going to be way more beneficial with
those particular tasks then say having a
higher number of logical cores by the
way of hyper threading now conversely if
you aren't using multi-threaded
applications often and your main focus
is on programs that utilize only one CPU
core at a time then the 7350 K could
make a lot of sense especially if you're
on a super tight budget of around 180
dollars for your CPU
not to mention overclocking this thing
is a great overclocker I do want to
reiterate that up to 5 gigahertz with
really no other tweaking other than
changing the BIOS and the multiplier
which is super nice to see not to
mention those higher clock speeds are
going to make those single-threaded apps
run a lot faster and make your
day-to-day tasks just feel overall more
zippy in the end but that is pretty much
I think all I want to say about the core
i3
7350 K guys let me know your thoughts in
the comments below this is a hugely
hugely talked about CPU right now on the
Intel side of things I'm curious to hear
what you guys have to say about it
so also feel free to toss me a like on
the video if you enjoyed it feel free to
have fun feel free to subscribe to the
channel for more tech stuff coming that
you guys really soon and until we meet
again I'll see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
