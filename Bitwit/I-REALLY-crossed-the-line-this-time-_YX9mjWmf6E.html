to do today we've got a list you know
it's serious adult thing when you've got
a list of errands the first thing on the
agenda is shower door okay coffee first
and then we have to get a shower door
there's actually a contractor in our
shower at home right now well that
sounds weird when I say that he's in our
shower he's not bathing in our house
right now that'd be really weird but he
is currently working on our shower
retiling the whole thing getting a new
door new window and all that stuff he's
already got the tile or he's gonna pick
the tile up in a couple days it's gonna
be like a multi-day process we have to
pick out a shower door he's probably not
gonna get around to installing it today
but at least we we should get something
nailed down and find a style that we
like and stuff that's the first thing on
our laundry list here so to Home Depot
we go coffee we go okay coffee coffee
coffee first yep but actually honey
we're already on our way to Home Depot
so if we don't see a coffee place on the
way there we should damn it why do they
have to be everywhere
thank you we are at Home Depot - all
right you wanna find - the bath shower
doors oh they're all just kind of slabs
a glass they don't have any frames
around them so these are the finishes
sold separately it's basically the frame
of the door looks like they've got sort
of a metallic I don't know what this is
not a huge selection here it's really
just these two options we don't really
like oh right so we're probably have to
go to like a custom glass door because
you don't like anything we see here but
and you might be able to find some
fixtures we likes let's check those out
fixture world so we're looking for black
right about that one no one kind of
looks like a UFO kind of cool that was
I'm bad 40 bucks all right as you can
tell my pee sauce is very particular the
woman knows what she wants takes her
five years oh that was sweet
and they say you have standards so we
basically done here I think we're done
here I refuse to leave Home Depot
without getting anything so we're
getting this this hose rack all right
where we going now after that failed
attempt Oh
right here well we're still on shower
door so actually I'm kind of hungry are
you hungry yeah okay one veg world guess
who picked this place animal style fries
this cheese is made out of potatoes
apparently I gotta try this let's give
it a shot
it's actually not bad and I got a
Italian BLT which has fake bacon crispy
chickens - yeah you look like a Carl's
jr. commercial right now that was that
was actually pretty satisfying
surprising like you know for being being
fully vegan we're gonna circle back to
the the shower door we need to get a
futon now because we actually have our
good friends Jeff and Rashmi coming over
for the weekend they're from out of town
they live in Santa Barbara no Santa Cruz
they live in Santa Cruz who cares no one
no one cares where Jeff from Rush Mila
they're getting here tomorrow and
they're gonna be spending the night for
like two or three nights at our new
house and we have nowhere for them to
sleep so we're actually gonna try to
find a futon or some sort of sleeper
maybe a fold-out couch I think it's
pretty ambitious trying to get something
like that
into our house before they get there
tomorrow we'll see what we can do okay
there's been a little bit of a detour
here we actually have to make a pit stop
at home first because wifey sauce forgot
to get the proper measurements of where
the futon or sleeper couch can actually
fit your fault see it's not always me
just most of the time now while we're
here here's a quick look at what the
shower looks like currently he's
actually been doing some patch work just
prepping the surface for waterproofing
and then eventually tiling of course but
it's looking pretty good
still it's a long way to go don't
terrorize the contractor or he'll never
come back we'll have a half-finished
shower yeah no no if you're coming with
us by the sofa company how's it feel
okay this is a pretty cool sofa bed
because usually the sofa beds you have
to remove the cushions and find a spot
for those these are actually fixed to
the sofa itself and there's just a
single handle here that you pull back
and it essentially just keeps rolling
until you have a full bed I like this oh
this one is actually way more
comfortable than that one you like this
one it's first comfort yeah all right
you know what to do test number three
yep how's it compare to the other two
the second one second one is this now
what's more comfortable this one or the
first one first
after all it feels somewhat similar to
the first one may I agree the second one
is probably the most comfortable mm-hmm
but it's also a bit more pricey than
this one all right well that was a
pretty good experience we saw some sofa
beds that we really liked unfortunately
they were kind of pricey all well over a
thousand bucks a bit out of our price
range just because we won't be using
these very often that's really only when
people come over and crash for the night
so we're actually gonna go to a futon
store that only has futons and no sofa
beds I believe we'll have a different
variety of options that cheaper shop
Google okay what's wrong with this
picture yeah left blinker and right
blinker
and they're playing chicken with each
other what's gonna happen waiting for
the green up and screen oh really
okay so they both okay that was
underwhelming
what was that in your hair
all right we're at the futon store let's
let's check this one out
okay so huh oh what's happening
transformers oh look at that all right
give it a shot oh yeah actually I think
this is pretty spacious it looks smaller
than it is yeah I feel like you're far
away enough you could be further it
could be further away it's actually
pretty spacious so we are we are now
buying this futon it's compact it fits
the space we need in our office it's
actually fairly comfortable the best
part of all is that they actually have
this in stock so they're gonna deliver
it tomorrow just in time before our
friends get here for the weekend so
they'll actually be perfectly
accommodated and have a chance at some
decent night's sleep so yes I'm so glad
we actually get to cross at least one
thing off of our list for today futon
city you know look a little seedy in
there when we walked in i had this smell
it definitely wasn't as high-quality or
upscale as the last sofa place we went
to but the prices were I mean that sofa
was half the price of the one that we
really liked at the last store I'm
really stoked that her friends are gonna
be able to enjoy it this weekend the
other place was like yeah we'll have it
to you in like a week how about Friday
all right so what's next
I say we circle back to getting a shower
door something a bit more modern I don't
think we're gonna go with an enclosed
sliding glass door we're just gonna do a
single slab and it's gonna be an open
design so it's not gonna go across the
full tub rather it's gonna be partially
covering the actual entrance to the tub
just for a more sleek and modern look so
on that note let's get some all right
we're in that place in like 10 minutes
but we learned a lot about glass we
learned that the type of glass panel we
want is called the partition we're gonna
get one of those installed probably
within a week or so and then we'll
decide from there if we like the
partition or if we want to add a door to
it that essentially closed off the tub a
little bit more maybe prevent some water
leakage but we'll cross that bridge when
we get to it now we have one more tour
to run before we go back home and clean
the garage and that is
very important this is not how this is
supposed to work
stop means go its opposite day
Olek Tokyo Drift you started it so how
do you choose toilet paper there's so
many different options will it sustain
my but then we're good alright we can go
home now what what what does that for is
that for the futon we just bought hey
hey don't do that don't don't put that
in there that's what she said you can't
just go to Target get one thing with her
can you it just doesn't work that way is
this what is this why do we need this
your little marijuana plant if you
wanted to grow you should have just
asked alright I think we've shopped
enough we got to clean that garage
before the Sun Goes Down
let's let's go okay we are finally home
it's been a long day look at all these
packages that we got while we were out
contractor was nice enough to bring
these in for us he's long gone he's gone
home fight look so let's open some of
these guys let's see we got here
assuming that it's stuff I can actually
show you yeah what what are those haha
bps Kustoms my buddy old pal Brian
actually sent these overnight so I
should check out his YouTube channel if
you like tech which if you're watching
this you probably do he makes the most
average videos ever it's really
impressive these really comfy though and
I like the big hood makes me feel like
rocky thanks Brent a little baby box
here from new egg come on foot use foot
to stabilize box do not cut foot only
then will you master the art of unboxing
oh oh what hold on where did this come
from I legitimately did not order this
honey why did we get a 9900 K who sent
this oh right my wife is also filled me
in on what this is for she knows more
than I do I can't talk about it but I
guarantee you it's gonna be cool so stay
tuned stay tuned and that's it okay I
gotta throw all this stuff away now
which reminds me we gotta clean up the
garage
you know I haven't been in there in a
while it's probably not as cluttered as
I remember
okay Leah that looks so much bigger when
it's not just a giant pile of crap in
the middle took a lot less time than I
thought I was estimating two to three
maybe even four hours for everything but
we got this all done in about an hour 15
now granted it's not the best storing
job we've ever done looks a little
cluttered still here and there but
hopefully over time we can reorganize
this make it a bit more tidy possibly
install some shelving cabinetry whatever
to keep things a bit more dust free but
altogether this is looking pretty good
and we can finally for the first time
ever since moving into this house over
two months ago park a car in our damn
garage
Oh beautiful this is life
did you do that no I thought I thought
you did that no well now would be a good
time to turn off the engine
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
