Computex 2016 is brought to you by
gigabyte fantex cable mod and g.skill
without them I would still be at home
with more free time click the links in
the description for more info what's up
guys I'm now with the fan text booth
covering a lot of cool stuff here
they've got a smorgasbord of stuff I
like saying that word a lot so this is
the n2 elite and it's a beast of a case
you can just see right here it's
absolutely beautiful as well it's got a
full tempered glass side panel $700 it's
going to set you back about 700
Benjamins however it is pretty much
packed to the brim with features for
custom water cooling etc you can also
expect to maybe pick one of these up
during late late September I believe so
ridiculous amounts of radiator support
you've got 480 basically at the top and
the bottom you can even see there's like
a compartmentalized floor right here and
you can actually mount radiator not only
on the very bottom of the case but at
the ceiling of that flap as well that's
really cool you've also got support for
a 5 60 I believe at the front which is
pretty insane pretty much any radiator
possible can fit into this thing you can
also see there's quite a bit of really
nice-looking water blocks in here maybe
you haven't seen before these are
actually also from fantex so you've got
custom water blocks for the CPU and GPU
they look really nice actually and they
feature built-in RGB LEDs which can
connect to your motherboard you can
configure all that stuff in the software
if you choose it's really cool stuff
even the fittings are fantex as well so
they've really done a bang-up job here
and again about the the case it's just
completely customizable it comes with
like a bracket like this so whether you
want to mount some SSDs like you see
there or actually flip it around and
mount another radiator on that side so
you can actually have it facing and you
can peer through your window and see it
even these things like this this is a
top grill you can put on here so if you
wanted more airflow you've got the mesh
version you've also got a solid version
for optimized silence if you wanted to
be a quiet operation you do have some
ventilation slots at the top there so
you're not going to be starved for
airflow for your top intake so or
exhaust so yes pretty much good stuff
why don't we go ahead and take another
tour around the other sections of this
room yo dawg i heard you like tempered
glass so we put some tempered glass on
every single case possible including the
empty lux which up until this point has
never had a tempered glass on it so look
it looks it looks beautiful it's also in
an in a new color you can get it in
freakin grey what's it called in and
threat anthrax gray right totally
anthrax gray but you've also got the end
through evolved ATX of course the case
we know
love that Elsa looks really sexy to meet
you I'm totally gonna rip you off on
that later and end through pro-am also
with tempered glass awesome let's go
ahead and look at this case this is a
brand new case the enthu primo DS dual
system you can see that we've got a full
ATX motherboard in here as well as a
mini mini ITX at the bottom now there
was a case before this one that actually
supported dual system as well however it
was only micro ATX mini ITX a lot of
people were saying hey I want a full
frickin motherboard in there as well as
a mini ITX and so fantex has delivered
for the community here and also you can
see PCI riser cards for the ATX and the
mini ITX here so you can actually
configure the the GPUs so that the
waterblock is actually facing you again
using those fantex water blocks for the
CPU and GPU I think I just can't I can
say that right by the way guys my
