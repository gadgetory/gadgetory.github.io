channel today's video is going to be
very rushed and haphazardly thrown
together because I am out of time I have
a lot of things going on right now and
very little time to do them all in
actually I'm not gonna be able to make
another video until five days from now
because I've got a family thing that's
in the mountains there's no Wi-Fi there
I don't know why I agreed to it and then
after that I have to hop on a plane and
go to San Francisco to cover a press
event puts in video I don't know if I
can mention that adds probably fine and
then I have to prepare for the rising
launch but before all of that happens I
just needed to squeeze one video out for
you guys to watch this week so here it
is today I'm going to be benchmarking
and testing out the first video card I
ever purchased this is the GTX 670
direct cu2 from Asus and yes I know some
of you guys have video cards they're
probably older than I am I admit I did
get into the PC game quite late but
that's because I just never really had
anyone around in my growing up years to
show me the light and show me the way
until Paul came around he was like come
to me son and I was like yes master okay
then we're getting way out of hand
so getting back on task here the 600
series from Nvidia is based on the
Kepler architecture and this is when GPU
boost 1.0 was actually introduced for
the first time very exciting when it
first debuted so today I'm going to be
seeing if this thing still has any
horsepower left in it for today's modern
triple-a games such as doom GTA 5 even
though GTA 5 is a little bit older it's
still fairly relevant in terms of how
taxing it is on the hardware so we're
going to be putting it to the test today
I'm gonna be throwing it on a my testbed
which actually is rocking to 69 hundred
K right now overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz
and that's just so we don't run into any
CPU bottlenecking it's not the fastest
instructions per clock chip I know the
7,700 cable I'll perform it in many
cases for gaming however it's probably
not going to be a bottleneck when it
comes to testing with this guy so that's
going to be on a gaming Strix xi9
motherboard with 16 gigs of G no no no
Corsair Vengeance lpx at 3000 megahertz
and we're rocking a cooler master hyper
212 Evo on top of the CPU with power
supply SSD for our boot drive and stuff
like that so Windows 10 64 bits latest
Windows drivers I'm sorry windows
drivers Nvidia drivers wickel know what
is it's three seven three seven eight
six six is the latest because the
current driver at the time of filming
so we're gonna be testing this bad boy
with all of that hardware right now even
think it still works I don't know I
honestly haven't tried booting with it
before filming this video so this could
all be for nothing
we might try to power it on and not get
any video signal let's find out really
quick check this out this thing at a
back plate before it was cool
hell yeah all right we're going in oh
that went in easy that is nice and
broken in as Jay likes to say the power
plugs you've got 2 6 pins that's any
indication of how power efficient things
to become the last few generations
moment of truth ladies and gentlemen oh
wait note we need we need a video cable
I remember how to build computers oh
crap do we have a display poor yeah we
do
sweet we're in business we got one
DisplayPort one HDMI and two dual link
DVIs noise noise do we have a signal
give me up done I'm looking good this
isn't looking good
Oh altered white button to right well in
business news I know it would work I
wasn't scared at all alright let's go
ahead and jump in around here here we
probably need a keyboard - all right
I've kind of reposition the camera for
better viewing pleasure jump into a
laugh and I've already got games loaded
up on the SSD that we're booting from
here
so we're I'm just going to use my
regular suite of Oh No
all right that's a little better I
didn't have time to figure out what was
going wrong it's probably a driver thing
so I just swapped out a different boot
drive one that was more recently clean
installed and that seems to have done
the trick at least for now
check out the specs really quick okay so
we got the 28 nanometer architecture
again that's Kepler and let's compare
this you know just briefly to the gtx
1070 for a minute which is 60 nanometers
so that's shrunk down quite a bit of
course this is the GK 104 GPU 32 ro peas
and 112 PM you think we practically
doubled that on the ROP front and
definitely quite a few more TM use as
well the CUDA cores thirteen hundred and
forty four there's something like
nineteen hundred and something on the
GTX 1070 two gigs two gigs of gddr5
remember remember when most video cards
in 2011 had had two gigs on them we've
got the same bus with a 256 bit and
bandwidth of 192 point 3 gigabytes a
second core clock is 915 megahertz
boosting up to 980 the memory clock of
1502 I forgot to mention TDP on the GTX
670 is 170 watts and compare that to the
GTX 1070 at 150 watts back when you
consider how much faster the 1070 is
just a an indication of how much more
power efficient you get when you shrink
down that architecture among a number of
other things but let's go ahead and jump
into overwatch I do have a fraps loaded
up as well so we got a frame counter in
the top whoop let me change this to the
top right corner overlay let's do
options let's see 1080 yes we'll start
there display base let's go hi all right
it's it's putting us at high right now
alright so it looks like we're getting
around 70 FPS actually it's not moving
at all vsync is definitely off I've
disabled it both in the game and in the
Nvidia control panel but seems to be
things be at 70 very very consistent
even if I like look into a corner of the
room or something or the floor doesn't
change but the gameplay is very smooth
that's for sure
oh Jesus Oh people are so good at this
game now alright screw it I don't give a
 I don't give a I'll kill you
no you killed me that's ok alright any
rate 70 FPS looks pretty good let's move
on to the next game yeah I know I'm
leaving my team because I must come back
so we we hit a thousand 94 megahertz
thanks to our GPU boost 1.0 and we also
hit 71 degrees C as our max temperature
which isn't too bad of course this is a
fairly low powered GPU as far as
modern-day graphics cards go these days
but that's still pretty nice it's doom
time baby so this is a little bit more
intensive than overwatch yes yes ultra
alright screw it let's just push a few
old trap let's see what we can do yep
we're getting into 30 we're getting a
little a little close to chop Ville
actually dipping down to the 20s right
now that's no bueno
so du monde ultra GTX 670 probably not
the best fit go ahead and crank that
let's do hi see how that works
alright oh that's better now we're in
the 40s look like we're dipping in the
20s too much go ahead start some
see what happens here when our little
friends come out to play are you at Oh
bad place to spawn terrible choice
alright so game plays not the smoothest
but it is playable definitely much more
so than when we're running Ultra alright
let's see what happens if we do medium
and just exactly how that looks alright
even even smoother now this is
definitely this is this is probably what
I would play at medium settings so it
does doom on medium which still looks
pretty good honestly I will say it's not
quite as crispy of course but doesn't
really take take you too much out of the
experience especially when you get a bit
more visual fluidity at play
I'm sure during more intensive parts of
this game it will dip into the 30s maybe
you'll even hit in the 20s once in a
while but for the most part I would say
doom is very playable on the GTX 670 if
you're willing to sacrifice just a bit
of graphic fidelity
I say we fire up the Metro last light
benchmark and this is by no means a new
game but it is still very GPU bound it
would appear the 920 will do oh I'm
going to say medium we'll do medium 4x
motions with blah blah tessellation
we'll do normal justjust just a little
tiny bit of tessellation and then yeah
we'll just go ahead and we're unselected
all right we're starting out with around
80 fps not too bad of course this is
probably the least graphically taxing
part of the benchmark nope this part is
because now we're at 140 can I see you
at 150 no we're going back down again
but once the explosion happens and
people just start killing each other
that's that's when it's when it really
brings the GPU to its knees there we go
let's see the framerate is you're going
to dip of course it is so now we're in
the 70s which still well above 60 okay
now we're in the 60s not too bad though
oh it's loud very loud we're in the
forties here
that's the lowest I've seen it so far
alright see what our average FPS was
eighty one point nine frames per second
not too shabby now you could probably
even get away with high if you really
wanted to but again to play it safe I
probably stick on medium especially
since we were seeing dips into the 40's
cranking it to high might might that
result in some pretty bad choppiness oh
no no we played the GTA 5 we played a
good one from the textile are we doing
1080 no imma say eh screw that screw
fxaa
let's see they're putting this at normal
the high setting a couple things we can
get away with very high but for the most
part I trust those settings let's go
ahead wait we think I think vsync is on
yes it is they think off all right what
do we got
Oh up soon as we go out boom wait what
yes see this is what I love about gta5
is that it is incredibly demanding on
the hardware but it's also a super
scalable title so we're getting around
7080 FPS right now the game definitely
definitely looks not as crispy as I'm
used to but you know what I
I much more value the playability than
than the eye candy at this point killing
people is still just as fun - so if I
were to just guess off the top of my
head based on the numbers I'm seeing so
far I would probably put this card on
par with the GTX 1050 TI or something
like that where you can get away with
you know maybe some high settings on
these triple-a titles definitely not
ultra in most cases which is generally
the case for the 10th of dpi but still
very very playable if you did want to
play with the big big leagues and enjoy
some of these more ambitious games then
you certainly can you have to be okay
with cranking down the settings oh look
it's a ramp hit it oh that's the garbage
truck damn it oh you you
American toast I go back to my homeland
talking major about you are
you
okay let's move on to our lefty
watchdogs - oh gee I'm in 4k that's why
I'm getting success via by the way I'm
sure you guys already noticed but all
the games I've run so far have been at
1920 by 1080 which was actually the
resolution this card was pretty much
intended for on the day it launched and
seems to still be holding up its end of
the bargain on that front so we're going
to crank this down I think ultra is a
little too much for for the GTX 670 here
so we're going to do medium alright so
now we are cruising and it's around 50
FPS starting out this is the very
beginning of the game with no spoiler
alerts or anything like that I think
this is probably the newest game that we
have on today's list and definitely
shows this is taxing the the card harder
than any other game that we've that
we've tried so far and I'm getting effed
up right now but that's okay definitely
saw some dips into the 30s there and
again this is at medium settings so
would not try I would not dare go past
medium at this rate so yeah definitely
playable doesn't look fantastic but you
know if you're okay with console level
quality then I guess you would be
perfectly fine gaming with a GTX 760 in
this game as well and I guess that kind
of sums up this bit this video here guys
I told you it was going to be short and
crappy and poorly thrown together so
it's a very least you know that when I
promise you something I always deliver
all right so to sum up really quick I
mean from the hour or so that I spent
with this thing again didn't do a deep
dive into testing it because I didn't
strapped for time but honestly I'm
pretty impressed with how well it's held
up over the last six or so years
honestly I wouldn't be opposed to
putting it in something like an HT PC or
even an entry level gaming rig again I'm
kind of equated it to the GTX 1050 or
the 1050 Ti in a way but of course much
more power hungry however if you can
afford the additional wattage and you
don't mind it just being an old older
card it's still perfectly good in a
variety of Triple A games if you're
willing again to crank down some of
those quality settings and to be honest
after shooting this little video I'm
kind of curious now to perhaps do a
follow-up where I put the GTX 670
against
other modern cards within its class I
think that might be kind of interesting
but of course I have run out of time so
I know this video sucks guys I do
apologize if you enjoyed it just a
little bit go ahead and toss me a like
on it and share your support and love in
the comments as always but I got a
skedaddle so thank you so much for
tuning in I do appreciate it I'll be
back very soon with a more thorough and
high-quality video as opposed to this
one and yeah you can bet on that so feel
free to subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already so you don't miss it
have it going guys I'll see y'all in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
