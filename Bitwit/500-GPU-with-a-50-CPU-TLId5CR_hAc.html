footprint without compromising on
features like flexible hardware
configurations a removable radiator
bracket for easy installation and
stellar cable management for a tidier
system Gaiman style with a tempered
glass side panel integrated RGB lighting
and a built-in cam powered smart device
to manage your lighting and fans do more
with less in the H 500 I click the link
below to learn more so the other week I
gave myself about a $600 budget to
upgrade the old Craigslist PC that I
purchased months ago and what I ended up
doing was pretty much overhauling the
entire system replacing and gutting the
platform swapping out the z77 platform
with a core i5 35 70k with this lovely
new be 350 board and a risin 5 1600 i
also swapped out the original radeon HD
7850 for this EVGA gtx 1050 Ti needless
to say this thing runs circles around
its predecessor in terms of gaming
performance and CPU GPU everything
across the board has pretty much been
massively improved that being said that
$600 could have been spent a hundred
maybe even a thousand different ways so
what I want to do today is sort of
explore one other possible Avenue that
we could have taken weeks ago so for
today's scenario just imagine if we
spent that $600 on just two components a
new power supply and a modern high-end
graphics card like this EVGA GTX 1080
for the win this is about five hundred
and fifty dollars you can find a power
supply similar to this one that's 600
650 watt semi modular 80 plus bronze for
about 50 bucks so and then obviously we
could have used the existing power
supply in the Craigslist PC but it's an
old thermaltake one it's probably not
even 80 plus and judging from the
reviews I saw a new egg yeah I'm
definitely not pairing that with my gtx
1080 now it seems kind of silly to pair
a gtx 1080 with a five-year-old quad
core 4 thread cpu like 35 70 k but at
the same time a lot of you guys probably
have maybe a four or five year old
gaming pc and you're at a fork in the
road in terms of how the heck am I
supposed to upgrade this do you really
need to replace your entire platform or
can you simply drop in a new video
and be good to go I guess we're gonna
take a closer look at it right now as
I've already run the tests on both of
these setups so let's just dive right
into the benchmarks and we'll circle
back and talk about it a little bit
before we close things up roll tape
all right show us is really interesting
man really really interesting stuff so
clearly the GTX 1080 even when paired
with a 35 70 K just has so much more
graphical horsepower than the risin 5
1600 system you know with it slowly GTX
1050 Ti as indicated from those fire
strike numbers rather the gate holy
smokes some impressive numbers right
there and we even saw this you know
evidently in battlefield 1 and doom the
GTX 1080 rig just swept the floor with
its competitor I mean absolutely like
the average frame rates were through the
roof come in comparison however if you
take a closer look at the frame times in
battlefield 1 you'll see that the risin
5 1600 system actually fared a lot
better those those frame rates were
tightly grouped together whereas they're
kind of just all over the place and
stretched out with that 35 70 K
obviously being a pretty bad bottleneck
here and I think you know I didn't
really notice any problems when I was
playing on that system however I think
someone with maybe a more keen eye could
probably pick up on the fact that hey
this game is dropping from 100 frames
per second to 60 frames per second and
then back up you know at a moment's
notice someone with a more keen eye than
me might be affected by that level of
performance and of course we can't
ignore GTA 5 where the 35 70 K was
bottlenecking the GTX 1080 so badly that
the game was virtually unplayable I mean
frame times were so jumpy they were all
over the place that we were seeing
constant stuttering really bad
stuttering to throughout the entire
gameplay so it was really bad I had to
like just stop halfway through I was
like now this is giving me a headache
and stuff and obviously the average
frame rates were much higher than the
Rison system but at least the Rison
system was was smooth it was constant we
were able to play it just fine so it's
really kind of interesting when you
think about it the rise in PC is
typically slower than its competitor
because of the graphics card difference
but its parts are better suited for each
other as a whole which i think makes it
a more reliable system overall another
thing to consider if you're gonna pop in
something like a GTX 1080 into your
five-year-old system is how much
performance you're actually wasting due
to the CPU bottleneck and to find out
exactly I actually paired that GTX 10 80
with a core I nine 7900 X
running stock tested the same three
games of the same settings of resolution
and found that we were losing about 60
frames per second on average per game if
you factor it out and average it out
which is incredible and presumably
you're paying 100% of the price for your
GTX 1080
but you're maybe only getting 65 to 75%
of the performance so definitely
something to keep in mind and I guess
this is all to say that perhaps neither
of these upgrade paths that we explore
today are the absolute ideal or optimal
choice maybe something in the middle of
the road is for the best for example
maybe cutting down your graphics card to
say a gtx 1070 or even a gtx 1066
gigabyte variant and having a little bit
more spending power to upgrade your cpu
which in this case you can really only
go to a core i7 3770k that would get you
four more threats but without further
testing in another video it's really
kind of hard to say how that pairing
would perform but very interesting data
all things considered that's pretty much
all I got for now guys so let me know
what you think of the results down below
and also if you have any opinions on how
you would have spent the $600 upgrade
blow that shit up
but I'm gonna get the hell out of here
guys thank you so much for watching this
video toss a like on it if you enjoyed
it and get subscribed so you don't miss
any more tech videos coming really soon
you can also check me out on floatplane
if you'd like to watch my content a week
early without ads for three bucks a
month I'll put a link for that in the
video description till next time guys
thanks for tuning in have yourselves a
good one and I'll see you all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
