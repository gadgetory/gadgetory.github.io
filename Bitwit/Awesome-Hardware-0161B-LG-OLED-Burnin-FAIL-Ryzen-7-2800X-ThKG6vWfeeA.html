should be good
hello world welcome back to awesome
hardware this is episode 161 you're
watching side B side a was just
broadcast to Paul's channel you can
check it out in the link in my video
description if you're watching on
youtube stay where you are if you're on
Twitch welcome back everyone this is a
live show that Poe and I do every single
Tuesday and we like to have a few drinks
on the show while we're at it so cheers
to all of you out there thanks for
joining us you can also feel free to
support us on either of our stores where
we sell the highest of qualities of
merchandise is my story is bid with tech
that sentence made total several text or
or you just got a bit with tech it'll
take you to the the front page which is
the store shirts mouse pads hoodies all
that stuff store for Paul is Paul's
Harbor net some pretend that he sells a
lot of the same things but with his
logos and his designs you should buy 10
of everything on both sites and we'll
yell Johnson at you later on also we can
we occasionally use adult language so if
you have little ones around or sensitive
hearing be warned adult language is
coming your way
although I don't think we actually
custom my half we we went the whole time
it might have said one or two maybe no I
guess I wasn't paying close enough
attention never just happen so naturally
don't do it but ok let's just dive right
in shall we with some news generic
general tech news starting with a OC the
panel maker curved they just released a
series of new curved displays that are
aimed at a sub I budget gaming market so
if you're a hundred and forty-four Hertz
free sink for 230 bucks it's actually
pretty darn good this is an article from
Tom's Hardware so take it with a grain
of salt so they're obviously
recommending that you buy these monitors
I'm pre-order immediately before the
videos come out they're also the best
monitors ever to exist I mean when your
life flashes before your eyes do you
really want it to be without 144 Hertz
um
at any rate look there's a complete
later video embedded in the article and
and if you scroll down to get away from
it it'll pop up in the lower thirds it's
beautiful
all right so a OC announced four of
their g1 series curved gaming monitors
these are pretty affordably priced here
as I mentioned the specs for all of
these panels all four panels regardless
of the screen size they all feature free
sync okay they're all 144 Hertz one
millisecond response time 3,000 to 1
contrast ratio
the models are as follows there's a
32-inch c3 to g1 a 27-inch CT c27 g1 and
the 24-inch c24 g1 these are all
equipped with the VA panels 27 24 32
inch yep and those are all 1920 by 1080
and then the the one that I guess the
flagship monitor if you will is a 32
inch cq3 2g one boasts a higher quad HD
resolution of 2560 by 1440 so these are
all 1080p monitors except that flagship
32 inch but there is a 32 inch 1920 by
1080 panel as well these are all 16 by 9
as I mentioned and the I should mention
that the curvature on the 24 inch model
is 1500 hours so it's actually the most
curvaceous of the of the bunch the
others feature a slightly less
aggressive curve of 1800 are the panels
each have a single display port or I'm
sorry a decent port one DisplayPort 1.2
to HDMI 1.4 and a 3.5 millimeter jack
the stands also feature the sort of
triplet of swivel tilt and and and what
is it height adjustment it has a D so it
does have a decent for some odd reason
not sure okay
maybe for troubleshooting or SAT so
you've backwards compatibility yeah yeah
who knows it's got a hundred by hundred
base amounts as well if you want to put
it on a you know third-party stand or
something like that three-year warranty
as of now only the 27-inch c-27 g1 is
available on Newegg for two hundred and
seventy nine ninety nine so 27 inch
1080p 144 hertz freesync
279 not too shabby you've got 24 inch
and the 32 inch both 32 inches one
that's quite easy one that's full HD
will retail for two $29.99 for the 24
inch $2.99 for the 32 inch 1080p model
and 399 which is clearly the most
expensive here 400 bucks for that quad
HD 32 inch panel so some some sweet
offerings from AOC those three models
that I just listed off will be available
later this year did you say what what
the panel technology was VA it's VA okay
ba panel right so it's kind of nice in
between between you know TN and IPS yes
all right so let's let's move along here
on this next article is from extrude no
8 it's from an antic sorry I don't know
I just kind of sifted through this
article kind of briefly because it's you
know it's an antique so there's a lot of
detail here this is the stuff that we
reported might be a rumor last week yes
and now it's true so it's all it's all
out there are four new rising CPUs that
have just launched very exciting stuff
we've got the rise in seven 2700
which is an 8 core 16 thread part at 2.8
gigahertz to four to four gigahertz
what's interesting about this chip and
the one that follows is their TDP 45
watts this is the lowest TDP that we've
ever seen on these mainstream Verizon
CPUs that's pretty cool actually it's
really especially with the 4 gig 4
gigahertz turbo the fact that we're not
really seeing much of a down clock from
its it's full 100 105 watt TDP
counterparts the 2700 X it's like it's
pretty damn good yeah pretty damn good
I'm actually considering now that this
is out I'm considering swapping out my
2700 X in the little Dan case build for
this for this because it was if you
watch the video today that I posted
today is getting a little hot even with
that 92 millimeter a i/o on there it's
get a little too hot for my liking I was
thinking about swapping it out for the
2700 but now I might just go for the
2700 II and and just make thermals even
less no problem you'd be like chilly in
there super chilly probably turn the fan
speed down and stuff and that would also
be cool because we could do some compare
testing to see what kind of performance
difference there is going from a 105
watt tbp chip to a 45 watt TDP chip and
seeing you know if that if that makes
much of a difference there there's also
the risin 5 2600 e 6 cores 12 threads
3.1 to 4 gigahertz again pretty nice
pretty keeping in with those relatively
high boost clocks again at 45 Watts TDP
Wow not too bad and then you've got two
others these next two SKUs are 65 watt
TDP you've got the risin 5 2500 X which
is a 4 core 8 thread part so you get SMT
boosting up to 4 gigahertz once again
now this is this will actually have half
the l3 cache as the 2600 e at 8
megabytes and then finally we have the
rise in 3 2300 x4 core 4 thread part no
SMT and that's gonna boost up to 4
gigahertz once again 65 Watts TDP and
again we have 8 megabytes of l3 compared
to the horizon 3 1300 X which had double
that at 16 megabytes so why is there
less cash on the 2500 X and the 2300 X
well all the first gen rising processors
were using parts from both of the on-die
CC X's but with this wave of CPUs and
ease chosen to use a single CCX cluster
and but they're still saying that these
chips are bound to perform 8 to 10
percent higher or better than their last
gen counterparts so single CC X and
there's also probably a little bit of
latency or that's that's not that's not
prevalent anymore yeah I mean that does
that's one of the reasons why high-speed
memory is good with Rison is because the
Infinity fabric is gonna operate at the
same speed that your memory is running
it and communication between the CC X's
a little bit of latency which was one of
the complaints with game performance so
it would be interested to see how this
is how that's how that's affected with
this since we know they're actually only
using one cc X or the other yeah so good
stuff these these are definitely not
CPUs to be overlooked this is not I mean
I feel like these launched relatively
quietly
yeah they're molar I got sampled for
them or anything like that there wasn't
like some big embargo that I did for ice
reviewers but I think the reason the
pricing isn't listed here is because
these aren't gonna be retail CPUs at
least I'm pretty sure that's the case
for the 2500 X to 2300 X the X ones that
are on here right look like system
integrators yes and they're going
straight to system integrators yeah that
make sense yep you'll probably still be
able to buy them but not but just not
maybe you like tray CPUs or OEM like
where you get just a CPU by itself right
maybe not retail package with that and
I'm gonna try to get my hands on one
I'll buy a freaking pre-built from cyber
cooler whatever the fuck if I have to
yeah cyber power might as well be
wandering all right let's move on tech
spot tech spot with the article about
Nvidia keeping their GTX 1080 and 1080
Ti through the holiday season so
basically Pascal and touring for the
rest of 2018 will coexist will coexist
but not compete but not compete that's
that's an important Asterix there and
videos CFO Colette kress confirmed that
for the rest of the year the Turing
based r-tx 2080 TI r TX 2080 and the r
TX 2070 cards will be sold alongside the
10 series Pascal GTX cards and I quote
we will be selling probably for the
holiday season
both are Turing and our Pascal overall
architecture remember Turing is a leap
forward in terms of overall capabilities
the performance improvement is much
greater than the overall price that
basically translates to these cards the
Turing cards are going to be really
expensive basically what she's saying
now bear in mind they're gonna be really
expensive but it's because the
performance will justify the price and
therefore it will not compete with the
Pascal cards so if you really want the
bit the best you know cutting edge shit
you better buy some touring cars now
Turing's and say spry insane price tag
will hopefully be justified by its
stellar performance she actually had a
bold statement here will likely see a 2x
improvement without even dealing with
overall ray tracing
your existing games in terms of existing
performance did she just say that Turing
is gonna be twice as fast
I just don't see that happening and if
so able to say this why didn't they say
that during the announcement it's almost
regulation it is and it in heightened a
lot of hype on NVIDIA side which you
know I get it that's their job
he's also the CFO which yeah she could
be completely down with all the
technical specs of the views themselves
but CFO is financial and you you might
not necess like she could easily be a
very good CFO and not really know
anything about the performance she's
just reading off a spec sheet like Tom
Peterson wrote up for but it actually
says like 2x the price of tends to
performance or something like that who
knows I'm sure she's very well informed
but again I wouldn't even expect I would
expect someone on the technical side to
even be hyping up RT X as much as it has
been the launch is September 20th 20th
so by then we'll probably have a better
idea of the performance yeah we haven't
even received our cards yet so I I have
no idea and even if I did I couldn't
tell you we're sending you five each
card again just show it to him script
new space all right Randall Jensen also
pointed out if the quote is up to two
times the performance then that could be
very low
yeah absolutely good point
all right hexxus brings us an article
about how a bunch of belgian nerds
hacked of Tesla Model S in seconds
what's with Belgium and today I don't
know man crazy alright there's their
stuff there's something in the chocolate
there they're denying loot boxes there
hacking Tesla's yeah we can't who are
these guys how's this work how can I
steal Tesla - so you could you and your
family can easily still steal a Tesla
Model S in seconds using the same
technique that these nerds at
call them nerds their researchers are
very smart at kayuu Leuven University in
Belgium found a way to unlock and drive
off with a Tesla Model S in mere seconds
they spent just around $600 on
off-the-shelf parts which included a
couple radio sensors and a Raspberry Pi
and then they basically created this
proof-of-concept hack that involves
getting it apparently involves like of
like a pointless Instagram bolter
pointless Instagram filter for the
entire video this contrast yeah yeah
that's fine that looks kind of stylized
yeah dude parks his Tesla so he's kind
of hooking he's hooking his little
MacGyver device up here okay all right
and then he I don't know what he did
there he I think he's sinking it oh he's
finding that he's finding the unlock
code now that's the owner sitting on the
the bench or whatever just like on the
rail that's not paying so he just
wirelessly acquired his the unlock codes
from that owners key fob the key fob is
the Achilles heel in this hack and so
within seconds his little MacGyver
device can actually retrieve the the
unlock codes off the key fob and then
once he brings it to the unlock sensor
in the car by the bing bada boom you
don't really need a physical key to
drive it to a Model S so he just drives
off like that the to be more specific
the reason why the the key fob is so
weak here is because it was previously
only using a 40-bit cipher or it was
using 40 bit ciphers to encrypt the
messages and send the lock and unlock
codes so the researchers basically
compiled all the possible key
combinations and stored them in a six
terabyte lookup table and so once that
guy walks up in and gets in within
proximity of the owners key fob it could
just quickly go through cycle through
all the possibilities until it finds the
one within about 1.6 seconds and finds
the correct unlock code and it's on it's
on the dudes device at that point you
can just walk over to the car and it
thinks it's the key fob so the key fob
needs one of those things it's like are
you a robot with a little check o
CAPTCHA yeah these all captured the guy
just struggles leads to ask the car that
every time
but if it's a caption that's like are
you a human trying to hack this car
[Laughter]
check check all of the boxes that have
pictures of cars cars that you wouldn't
steal so good guy no now now these you
gotta commend these Belgians all right
Belgium Ian's for Wobblies fractious
waffle waffles I love the chocolate the
fries you know Belgians they invented
the fry he's gotta give him credit they
did they did I learned that I learned
that when I was in Belgium
we're aren't economists they're elgin
fries i don't know because americans are
ignorant apparently xopen don't like to
give credit where credit's due surprised
we don't call American fries speaking of
giving credit where credit's due
hey thanks Gus from Kansas City you gusy
guy we're sending the beers that we have
been drinking so far today from KC beer
company oh yeah we finish these Bavarian
style wheat ale and dry hopped farmhouse
house ale they were really good actually
good I love them I'm not a huge fan of
wheat beers but that one was really good
I'll open it yep thank you yes Oh oh
yeah me too me too
we're just switching over to some milk
stuff here from left hand so I will say
yeah we got freedom fries you're right
you're right we got we call them freedom
fries here and true American fashion so
the good guy Belgians they actually
brought this hack to Tesla and Tesla
actually gave them like 10 grand for em
it's like a good Good Samaritan like a
thanks right hats then yeah their total
weight hats and they could have just
stolen like all the Model S's which is
what I would have done so they're much
better people than me but they're in
Tesla so here's how we figured this out
you know cool all right
oh thank you so much by the way anyone
who parked their tests in the lot today
I'll have to walk home I want to make
sure you have so because of these guys
Tesla took their information their
research and
they improve the key fob to make it more
secure so any model s that was sold
after or since June of this year is no
longer can no longer be affected by this
hack but older Tesla's the owners for
those they can actually choose to pay
for an upgraded fob that's more secure
that can't be so easily hacked
I think Tesla should just give them away
for free because that's I don't know if
that's that's their bad it does seem
like that's something they should just
be like yeah we'll send you that it
actually it seems like that's something
Tesla should just send all the people
who own my old model exactly a new key
fob exactly and say here use this yeah
it's totally yeah but there's also the
option now to turn on a pin to protect
against the hacking method so even if
they can get into the car there's still
a pin you have to enter before you can
drive it which I guess it prevents them
from stealing your car but they get
still like take a shit in your driver's
seat rank just the factory open your
doors which I'm sure like they go
through all the trouble of setting of
like hacking together whatever
technology is needed maybe so this
wireless thing that they used they get
in the car like well I can't steal it
shit well at least I can take dump
inducible driver's seat that was Plan B
as nearly as lucrative just takes
slightly less time to pay off if you
can't steal it shit investment for your
hardware there you go all right good
stuff and then our final story here for
tech news it is about as once again from
hexxus this is all over the place though
this year this today this year LG's OLED
TVs have been tested to show burnin
image burnin after just four thousand
hours Wow
even when LG has previously stated that
you could go 30,000 plus hours before
any image burnin really occurred 48
minute video our team am i pronouncing
that right our team's great earnings
it's just our t ing s all caps honestly
I'm not sure our teens are whatever our
teens I'm whole marketing's they do the
test you watch their video maybe they
say their name I didn't actually I
watched part of the video but it has 48
minutes come on
oh fuck that um they did a test that
tried to simulate natural but
accelerated viewing behavior of TVs of
six different TVs over the last half US
over the last six months six units that
you see on the screen there
we're playing were turned on for five
hours then they were turned off for an
hour and that was repeated four times a
day so they're turning on turning off
turning on turning off each TV have been
running for four thousand hours in total
after this six-month test and if you see
that the images here look at the the
pink one down there you can see that the
two left screens were running CNN the
whole time anytime they were on they
were tuned to CNN they have burned it
indeed the burn didn't fake news the
lower thirds horrible news is
unavoidable here the one at the top is
worse than the one on the bottom because
the one on the top is max brightness the
one on the bottom is running at 200 nits
okay the other four are also 208 so
slightly lower brightness but they were
running a variety of things including
pixels American football was on one yet
live NBC another FIFA 18 gameplay which
was the the video game that Paul is just
talking about on his half and call of
duty World War two was on another one
you can see it's the burden on those
four aren't nearly as bad as the CNN and
because there is constant movement
assistant logo in the same place yeah
they did say if there is a slight burnin
of the FIFA 18 logo which I couldn't
really spot from the images maybe it's
more visible in person but this is
definitely a concern if you have a super
expensive LG OLED panel yeah and you
watch a lot of CNN clearly yeah I would
never do a video on an lg tv that's why
it's part of my part of your and just
just standards I'm just kidding your
integrity
hey that they make some good products
they make you did a video on the there
wasn't no an OLED though was it no it
was a nano nano so how does the Nano so
nano cells are okay
yeah those don't burn n no burnin they
don't look quite as pretty but hey I'd
rather have a product that lasts than
one that's gonna fizzle out maybe it
looks a little better
or even a lot better this is all this
segment has basically been an ad for the
lg nano cell televisions buy them
instead of the shitty OLED versions yes
which cost more hashtag at all right
well I would be so more on a slightly
more serious note though yep OLED is
supposed to be the the kind of holy
grail of display technology so this is a
bit concerning for anyone who is
considering dropping a significant
amount of cash on an OLED display
whether you're talking about a TV or the
4k OLED monitors that have been teased
for like three or four years but never
seemed to actually launch I wonder if
that's one of the reasons yeah like are
they dealing with mms with burnin issues
cuz those I would have to think so
those are problems with earlier with
like plasmas right plasmas well
susceptible to that and earlier TV
technologies so I guess and and remember
the well was it no was it the pixel to
excel that had the burnin issues but
that was that an OLED with the the bar
at the bottom yeah
was that an OLED there's a pixel to it
yeah most most high ends small small
format displays on phones or oullette
right or right so it's definitely a
concern and that's probably a huge
reason why we don't see any OLED
displays like monitors gaming monitors
right I kind of wonder though if it's
possible or if in the future we might
see sort of a like a hybrid panel
technology where like the panel is like
IPs when you're like at your desktop or
browsing the web but as soon as you kick
into a game application it switches to
OLED and that way like since there's
constant motion or movement on screen
the burnin is significantly reduced or
whatever that would be kind of
interesting I don't know if that's even
possible but like the future is crazy
from a conceptual standpoint conceptual
yeah but I feel like the cost of having
essentially two displays in the single
display would be
would be defeating to that being a
viable product hey hey nvidia gpus will
be 5,000 a piece at that point yeah
it'll it'll just be you guys must be for
rich people we really care about is what
rich people can buy or or let's that's
who or watches our show - or what
samples room are you rich people at home
see for free
hey most of you have probably already
gone through two or three of these LG
oled tvs oh yeah absolutely just burn
them like running like camels start
we're about 9000 series this is new
segment no next segment it's not new but
next this is leaks we don't have a lower
thirds oh we have winners we have
wieners so that'll have to do for now
but this is actually leaked week's
segment we've got two articles here
first one from WCC of tech this fairly
quick the Intel Core i $9.99 hundred k
eight core beast from intel has yet
again had some leaks this time with 3d
mark time spy the benchmark has leaked
out at the stock clock speeds the cpu
scored ten thousand nine hundred and ten
points and in an FPS of thirty six point
six eight in the cpu tests from the same
dude on twitter to up beside weird weird
where did he get all this other shit and
how does he how is he so bold to just
post everything look he's got like a
typical Computex booth babe picture like
he's one of the dudes that goes around
he's in Bangkok Thailand I can't like
these booth babes though cuz they're
never covered ever revealing outfits and
they'll have super soakers that's fun
dangerous like are they gonna they gonna
shoot me
I don't know or you think it's all like
well it's fine cuz they're all covered
up and not scantily clad like most of
them they're gonna shoot each other with
those super soakers and it's gonna be
like a wet t-shirt contest then they'll
start making out at the end that's am I
wrong but only if they want to I'm not
and it's consensual
I won't look and look for so so okay
what so okay so I just read off we got
totally sidetracked there by boo
stock clocks all right at the stock
clock frequency the 9900 K ten thousand
nine hundred ten points there was also a
manual overclock recorded to four point
eight gigahertz which scored eleven
thousand four hundred and fifty nine
points and a slightly higher FPS of 38.5
compared to thirty six point six eight
what are we talking about the manual
overclock that this dude did on the nine
hundred K these are the scores you're
talking about right now I don't think
it's listed there I think just by ya
know he's got 2,700 X 900 K I don't
think he has the the manual or the
manually overclocked score isn't there
okay cuz he got eleven thousand
something in that one but at any rate
his manual OC scores were not that
impressive they weren't that much higher
than the stock clock frequencies the
stock clock scores but that's because he
only overclocked it to four point eight
the ninety nine hundred K already boosts
on all cores to four point seven so he
really only manually overclocked it one
hundred megahertz more which is at first
I was like wow that overclock sucks you
know these things ever clock like shit
or whatever that you don't feel better
performance out of him but that's just
because he did a really really like the
lowest over manual overclock that you
possibly can
he just wanted to say and here's
overclocked numbers yeah I don't know
why so it also leads me to believe that
maybe this is all think again these are
leeks grain of salt comparatively in
overclocked Rison 2700 X at 4.45
gigahertz scores 10,000 285 points which
is lower than the stock 9900 k scores I
mean I feel like this is not too
surprising with the higher instructions
per clock of these Intel chips the 9900
case stock is still ahead
blah blah and yeah you can expect even
higher scores I think when when users
start manually overclocking the retail
chips
of the 900k because those should
theoretically be able to push past the
five gigahertz mark which will be I
think submit significant over the four
point seven gigahertz boost out of the
box and especially when you're talking
about eight cores right so you can
expect a nitrogen family and z 390
chipset to arrive
come October this year if all goes
smoothly I don't have an exact date on
that I just know October October 8 I
like that this guy's name when he
submitted his score was slick Nick
favorite slick Nick favorite it just
sounds like total Engrish that's a good
one like we can see that on a certain in
Taiwan or something alright moving on to
our final article of the day Rison 720
800 x uu 10 cores yeah you had to wonder
when they did a 2700 X versus the
previous generations 1800 X hmm if there
was a 2800 X mhm in the waiting in the
wings 10 core and yet this one has two
more cores and four more threads this is
a poor headline AMD risin 7 2800 x10
processor 10 yeah that's weird why does
it say 10 processor intent there's 10
processors in this processor seen this
processor setting before 10 process I
think it's a typo it's not a typo that's
a word no no no a typo like they meant
to say 10 core processor that's
considered a typo so this el el el chapo
sus informatica released a Cinebench
screenshot featuring a 10 core rise in
cpu yielding and multi-threaded score of
around 20 130 which is quite a bit
higher than the 8 core 2700 X no single
threaded scores were shown but OC 3d did
lead with there
opinion that this is probably thinking
yes they did I will give them that
credit that should be noted the 2800 X
score is suspiciously close to a 70 900
X from Intel one of their core e9 chips
which means fake which is also a 10 core
which is also a 10 core yes you still
don't think so huh
really well it says when you pop a rise
in 2700 X in your system and you run
Cinebench it'll say risin 7 2700 X what
does this say risin are seven
interesting how suspicious also the 2700
X is listed in Cinebench as in 8 core
processor this however just says 10 core
processor
Prosser maybe it's getting cut off but
but but the verbage here the point is
the verbage here is not it's not
consistent I consisted with the real
deal ok consistent and it's faulty if
you want even more proof if you're still
not convinced and you just you have that
wishful thinking but I really want there
to be an 8/10 core resin CPU right now
no let me kill your dreams even further
and tell you that AMD CCX units the CCX
units that AMD is used only come in sets
of four making the next step up from
eight cores logically being 12 cores
not 10 cores they would have to they
would have to like you know cut off some
of the cores off of one of the CC X's
which AMD is not known for doing they
like to use the same number of cores per
cc X so for example for their six core
chips what do they do they do 3 plus 3
right or 4 plus 4 for the 8 core chips
and so forth
except for the ones you talked about
earlier that they just launched where
they didn't do that and they just use
one half of the CC X unit you shut up
that's this is irrelevant and totally
not quiet Paul I was on a roll kill my
parade
random I pray here so a 10 chord rise
and shit right now seems pretty unlikely
they would probably not aimed he
probably isn't thinking about creating a
whole new architecture for a single SKU
rather this is probably just
fake and why did we even talk about this
article then if though if we knew going
into it that ability fake because we
figured yeah it would feel time and
blast she text to put in the headline
did shit tons of views draw people in
you should get money get paid right -
their hopes that's what we're about
cool all right alright so this is it
that you're gonna gonna twist that into
like a positive at the end but no no
literally I speak the tries lies and
falsehoods well hasn't deception what
this great channel is built on ridin it
around
alright so that's my half y'all how long
was that not bad Kyle yeah
pretty short actually oh really
wait what when do we start that's
probably about 30 minutes we started
like 620 okay yeah yeah we're good
that's fine half an hour that was good
five minutes longer doesn't mean mine
had any less substance now yet plugging
a substance I mean I have had plenty of
substances substantial alright so what
are we doing right now we're we're
ending the show ending a house show but
don't go anywhere or actually if you're
on YouTube right now you should go to
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware don't
tell YouTube that we told you to do that
they get mad angry slightly confused but
go to twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
right now because there's an after party
oh I felt like got a little bit of while
in there I'll come okay man I've been
hanging out with them too much didn't
know that that could just cheer up like
like we had been building her like a
split personality that you've suppressed
for years and you yeah it's starting to
like disassociate creepy um alright so
go to twitch on TV slash off some
hardware where we will be doing a little
after-party yep having some fun
answering some of the questions that you
guys have sent out from your donations
thank you guys so much and your your
rightfully owed Johnson shout outs as
well indeed so join us there thanks for
watching this half of the show feel free
to do timestamps in the comments if you
like if you want to very much appreciate
it i'll pin your comment thank you guys
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
