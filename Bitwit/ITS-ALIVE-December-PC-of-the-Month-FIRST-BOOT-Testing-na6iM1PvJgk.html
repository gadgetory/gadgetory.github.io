the description to learn more before the
deal ends what's going on people welcome
back so today we're taking a closer look
at December's PC of the month which I
assembled back in December as you guys
might remember I didn't actually get the
system to boot or even turn on at all
because the power supply that England
had sent me actually shipped with a
improper cable so I was unable to show
you guys the finished build all lit up
or you know semi lit up and and with
fans running and so forth so today I
ended up swapping that power supply out
for a 500 watt EVGA 80 plus bronze unit
which is adequate for now as a temporary
solution believe it or not all my other
power supplies are wrapped up in other
builds at the moment so I wouldn't
recommend it for this particular system
because we have some high-end components
in here that we are gonna be
overclocking so for long term use I
would suggest a different power supply
but for the purpose of this video it's
probably fine but that being said here
it is it boots look it works I'm gonna
take the tempered glass side panel off
since it's tinted it's kind of hard to
see the beautiful innards but hey there
you go a lot of people on Instagram I'm
making fun of the fact that I only have
a single fan in the middle up there and
it looks funny I think it looks cool so
ha joke's on you now before we dive into
what the system is actually capable of I
wanted to quickly go over revisit the
specs to give you guys a refresher since
it has been a while since I built this
we've got an 1800 x resin 7 CPU 8 cores
16 threads along with the gtx 1070 TI
1070 TI from gigabyte the motherboard is
a be 350 tomahawk from msi paired with
16 gigs of g.skill ripjaws 5 ddr4 at 29
33 megahertz inside of the beautiful in
win 303 C case unfortunately as you guys
saw in part 1 I was unable to take
advantage of that front panel USB C port
because the motherboard that I picked
does not have a header for that also RGB
there's no RGB here because there's no
RGB header on the motherboard either I
made a lot of mistakes in part one the
case however is getting plenty of
airflow thanks to the help of our five
fractals
silent series our two fans we've set
three as intake at the bottom of the
case which is the only place where the
in wind 303 gets its intake from the
front panels completely closed off
there's not even any fan mounts up there
we have one rear fan at the exhaust or
one one exhaust fan at the rear and then
one more at the top of course and then I
almost forgot to mention our cryo rig h5
cooler with a slim fan here beautiful
sort of off-white plating at the front
just makes it look really nice and
cohesive with the rest of the build
along with these sleeved extensions from
waz mods he did an excellent job once
again overall a very very very nice
system I haven't configured the RGB
lighting on the card yet so it's kind of
mismatched there but other than that
that's sort of a refresher on December's
PC of the month let's go ahead and talk
about some overclocking starting with
our 1800 X I was actually able to push
that all the way to 4 gigahertz on all 8
cores very easily within
MSI's UEFI all I did was change the
multiplier and didn't have to touch the
voltage or the B CLK or anything like
that it was a very very simple procedure
we've also got our memory running at 29
33 just fine didn't do any overclocking
there I just wanted to hit the rated
speed which was also super simple with
an msi UEFI simply enabled an XMP
profile set the 29 33 megahertz profile
and we were good to go didn't even have
to fool around with cast latency timings
or or even input the the voltage
manually anything like that it was it
was really straightforward to be honest
which also goes to show that motherboard
manufacturers are rolling out more and
more updated BIOS ease that are
improving the support the memory
compatibility there's less that the end
user has to do in order to hit a memory
kits rated speed which is also fantastic
news I was very impressed with the clock
speeds we were able to hit on our gtx
1070 TI from gigabyte if you guys recall
the EVGA 1080i that i took a look at
earlier i think we got a 140 megahertz
offset on that and i thought that was
pretty good
took us around to the very low 2000
megahertz range but this guy was able to
pull off 170 megahertz of a core clock
offset which actually took us all the
way up to 2000 and 88 megahertz I
tweaked around with it a little bit and
was able to hit 2.1 gigahertz at one
point but
you know that was proved unstable once
we got around to fire strike extreme so
again a 170 megahertz core clock offset
with a 300 megahertz memory clock offset
means that we're hitting some really
nice clock speeds here overall that was
giving us a round of 4 to 5% or I'd say
3 to 5 percent increase in gaming
performance strictly from overclocking
the GPU we'll take a look at performance
of course in just a bit that leads us
right into thermals so starting with our
1800 X we were seeing very favorable
numbers in the 50 range so 50 degrees
Celsius there abouts minee we're putting
a heavy load on it's in GTA 5
battlefield one at 2560 by 1440 for
about half an hour in each game very
nice numbers I think the hottest week we
saw the the CPU get was about 68 degrees
Celsius and that was of course just a
random spike up to that number and then
it dropped back down to the 50s so
overall the cryo rig h5 is doing a
fantastic job of cooling this
overclocked 8 core monster of a CPU our
GPU is staying just as cool I mean quite
literally it's hitting 68 degrees
Celsius at its hottest that's just like
a random spike every now and then but
it's mainly staying around 65 66 degrees
celcius is where we're seeing it just
for fun just from the walls I actually
turned the case on its front side so
with the front panel facing on the
surface of the desk and just to see if
thermals would change it all from
opening up this this dust filter at the
bottom here and we actually saw a drop
of around 2 to 3 degrees which isn't
phenomenal I mean if we were if it was
like a 10 degree Delta or something like
that then you know then then we're
talking about a serious design flaw in
the case and win' has to go back to the
drawing board but just just sort of a
fun little experiment there I mean if
you're a freak about thermals I guess
that's one way to run your system but
probably inconvenient for most people
having the front IO on the bottom of
your case moving on to acoustics let's
talk about noise I mean right now the
system is idling side panels off
microphone is probably around eight or
nine inches away from the system and you
probably can't hear it much it's very
quiet these silent series fans are doing
a great job especially the fan on the h5
there and we have zero rpm fans on our
graphics card there are they are they
no they're not running that that's good
so it is a very quiet system for
day-to-day use however if you throw a
heavy load on it like rendering or
gaming those fans are gonna spin up
they're gonna speed up and all of a
sudden the system becomes much more
audible the main source of noise is
coming from the GPU it's got a triple
fan design and but it's not as loud as
it could be to be honest because it's
keeping the GPU so cool relatively cool
the fans don't need to work as hard to
to maintain those temperatures
additionally while it doesn't go
unnoticed when under load if you happen
to be listening to a game or movies or
whatever with a pair of cans or through
a set of speakers that are at medium or
higher volume this certainly doesn't
pose too much of an issue it's not going
to distract you or bring you out of
those experiences so I think that takes
us to benchmarking pretty much for use
in wickel driver 3 1977 and I ran a
couple of synthetics and six different
games at 1920 by 1080 and 2560 by 1440 I
didn't do any 4k benchmarks here usually
I cut that off at anything below a GTX
1080 simply because if you're buying a
10-7 TTI right now well if you're buying
a 10-7 TTI right now it means you're
loaded for one and additionally you're
probably gonna be gaining at 1080p 1440p
you know ultra wide resolutions for
example so with that said ladies and
gentleman let's take it away to some
benchmarks accompanied of course by the
face-melting sounds of brutally hardcore
metal music
alright y'all so there you guys have the
results let's quickly talk about some of
this data here before we close out for
starters this system was able to pull
off well over 60 FPS on average at both
resolutions in every game except for
ashes of the singularity which wasn't
even too far behind hovering in the 50s
even 1% lows for that matter
we're over 60 fps in all but ashes and
GTA 5 with the exception of pub G at
1440p which scored around 47 fps but
that's frickin pub G who cares but still
really really good numbers here ashes of
the singularity and GTA 5 were the only
two titles where we actually saw some
serious CPU bottlenecking where there
was next to no performance improvement
going from 1440p to 1080p so perhaps the
1800 X could use maybe in maybe an
upgrade to rise in second generation
chip once those come out that'd be an
interesting test actually rounding
things out here combining the frame
rates of all the games we tested we
actually saw an average of 117 FPS at
1080p and 90 fps on average at 1440p
very very respectable scores there so
altogether I would be happy to call this
a daily driver it's quiet it's cool and
it's it's pretty damn fast it's the only
problem with it is that it's gonna cost
an arm and a leg given the the DRAM
prices right now and especially our
graphic solution there but overall guys
that's December's PC of the month part 2
fully tested you guys let me know what
you think in the comments below that's
gonna sum this video up for now if you
enjoyed the video be sure to toss me a
like on it before you go you can also
check me out on floatplane so you can
watch the content like this up to a week
early without ads guys go ahead and
check it out I'll put a link in the
description below have a good one thank
you so much for tuning in and I will see
y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
