enthusiasts apparel awesomesauce shirts
are not only threaded they're hyper
threaded and come factory over cloth get
yours today at the awesomesauce - what's
of gas so if you'll be so kind allow me
to avert your attention for a moment to
the console / killer PC I built back in
May
such wall-mounted marbles make even the
finest piece of contemporary art look
like a grade school diorama but whether
you have a suspended system such as this
one or an HT PC in your living room for
example computers at a distance bring
about some challenges when using a
traditional set of wired peripherals to
prevent unnecessary cable clutter and
trip hazards opting for wireless devices
in this case is generally recommended
fortunately there are a plethora of
options these days when it comes to
wireless keyboards mice and headsets so
many in fact that it's often hard to
know where to look first so today I'll
be rounding up my top picks for each of
these peripherals geared to handle PC
gaming and everyday tasks starting with
my mouse of choice there are a few
better tried-and-true options these days
than the G 602 from Logitech and
although it isn't particularly new to
the scene it's reached critical acclaim
in the community for good reason for
starters the rubber palm rest textured
sides and contoured profile provide
excellent control and comfort for the
full gamut of hand sizes and grip styles
claw and palm grip users alike will
appreciate the elongated click buttons
and solid build quality while fingertip
grip users will likely be up in the air
another trait that makes the G 602 so
well rounded is the adjustable dpi and
six side macro buttons that give it the
flexibility to shine in a slew of game
genres in fact all eleven buttons on the
mouse are programmable to suit your
needs using the straightforward Logitech
Gaming software accuracy and
responsiveness are also on point thanks
to the Delta 0 sensor and 2.4 gigahertz
USB wireless receiver which generate an
imperceptible amount of input lag from
up to 3 meters away even in the heat of
a fast-paced shooter I'd still have a
hard time telling this mouse from a
wired device if it weren't for the sight
of my neglected Mouse bungee
although I experienced no connectivity
issues when plugging the dongle out of
sight behind my htpc for instance a
receiver extension cable comes included
if you require a direct line of sight
for better signal strength battery life
is also a huge plus with two
pre-installed double-a batteries that
offer up two hundred and fifty or
fourteen hundred and forty hours of
battery life in performance or endurance
mode respectively and sure a non
lithium-ion battery means no charging
capabilities here but if there's
anything we learn from the Battle of
Hoth its not to stretch a charging cable
across your living room instead of the
familiar weight system approach logitech
cleverly allows you to remove one of the
double-a batteries to adjust the mouse's
weight and balance though bear in mind
doing so will cut your battery life in
half ultimately it's this theme of
flexibility and performance that keep
the g6o - a personal favorite of mine
for cordless endeavors the second weapon
in my wireless arsenal is yet another
offering from Logitech I promise this
video isn't sponsored Hey
hey what's that thing what's what is
that in the air over there this is the K
800 wireless illuminated keyboard as the
name suggests the board features white
backlit keys with five levels of
adjustable brightness ranging from off
to very bright to save power the
backlighting turns off after a few
seconds of idling and a nifty proximity
feature automatically turns them back on
when your hands approach the keyboard
while mechanical keyboard purists will
shun this product for having membrane
keys the medium travel distance and
light actuation force allow for long
typing sessions with minimal finger
fatigue not to mention mainstream
Wireless mechanical keyboards still have
a ways to go overall you get a smooth
work and play experience here with the
exception of a mushy space bar feels
more like a granola bar the palm rest
and optional incline adjustment also
promote a comfortable typing environment
the top F row of keys is lined with
handy shortcuts both the media functions
along with brightness adjustment volume
control and the button to sleep and wake
your system wireless connectivity aboard
the K 800 is handled via 2.4 gigahertz
USB receiver that should be within the
line of sight of your keyboard for
optimal performance unlike the
unwavering g6o to having the keyboard
dongle plugged into the back of my htpc
resulted in some serious lag and missed
keystrokes but fortunately there's an
included receiver extension cable here
as well with a clear line-of-sight the
keyboard is fully responsive with
the slightest bit of input lag I
wouldn't take it to any csgo tournaments
but it's plenty fast for the average
gamer running on the two included
rechargeable double-a batteries you get
up to ten days of battery life per
charge via the micro USB cable and it's
worth noting that the keyboard can
operate without any batteries installed
when wired in there's also a battery
life indicator LED and power switch at
the top right corner of the keyboard yes
despite its uninspired appearance and
lack of any mechanical switches the K
800 still manages to check all the right
boxes for a wireless keyboard at a fair
price point that leads us to our final
wireless device which isn't from
Logitech by the way and also happens to
cost more than both of the affer mention
peripherals combined but its reputation
for being one of the best wireless
gaming headsets in the industry doesn't
go and founded the wireless age from
SteelSeries is a breath of fresh air in
an overly saturated market due to its
superior sound quality and innovative
battery solution which we'll touch on
later memory foam padding on the
adjustable headband and rotating faux
leather ear cups provides superb comfort
that lasts for hours though not without
first loosening up the aggressive
clamping force that comes out of the box
like a buddy of mine always says if it's
too tight it's not right I'm pretty sure
he's talking about headsets around the
ear cups you get a power button a chat
port for Xbox and an eighth inch air
port for connecting another pair of
headphones there's also a retractable
bendy Mike with unidirectional pattern
that isn't garbage quality per se but
admittedly should sound better than it
does considering the steep price tag you
can also mute the mic by tapping the
power button because no one wants to
hear the soundtrack to your extended
BioBricks removable cover plates on
either ear cup reveal a mini USB port on
one side for receiving firmware updates
from SteelSeries and one of two included
rechargeable lithium ion batteries what
makes the battery system so great here
is that the included transmitter has a
charging dock for the spare battery so
that by the time the active battery dies
a fresh one can be swapped out on the
fly for uninterrupted playtime such a
simple yet effective solution that sets
a new standard for wireless headsets
it's almost as genius as my idea for the
one click order pasta button the
transmitter also offers up a collection
of onboard features like game in chat
mixing EQ settings and Dolby Digital 7.1
surround chat mixing can be configured
manually or set to automatically lower
the game volume when chat audio is
present to aid with long-distance setups
a well-placed scroll wheel on the right
cup lets you adjust volume and navigate
the transmitters on screen display
giving you full access to the features
we just discussed another big dividend
of this headset is it's incredible
wireless range staying on the same floor
as the transmitter I explored every
corner of my house while listening to
music and the only drop I heard was the
bush even with multiple doors closed
between the headset and the transmitter
the signal remains strong and audio
crystal-clear perhaps the only thing
that tops the range of the H wireless is
its sound quality an area where most
gaming headsets fall immeasurably short
the cans make music a joy to listen to
and the virtual 7.1 surround enhances
in-game footsteps and gunfire
positioning to create one of the most
immersive gaming experiences I've had
with no strings attached to be perfectly
clear this is hands-down the best
sounding gaming headset I've tried to
date and the fact that it's wireless
makes it all the more impressive
top-notch sound a smart battery system
and a rich feature set make the H
wireless a must-have for untethered
gaming assuming you have the funds and
there it is ladies and gentlemen those
are my wireless inputs of choice for
gaming at a distance if you happen to be
reppin that keyboard mouse or Die kind
