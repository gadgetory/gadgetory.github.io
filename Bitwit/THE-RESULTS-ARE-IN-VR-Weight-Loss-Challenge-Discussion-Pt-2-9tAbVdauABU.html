channel hope you're all doing well today
we are doing part two or the follow up
or you could even call it the epic
conclusion of my 30-day VR weight-loss
challenge where in the span of 30 days
the main goal was how much weight could
I possibly lose with only playing VR and
the schedule for that was four times a
week and our piece and I will be honest
with you guys I have hit that
consistently for the last four weeks so
we're going to do a little reveal at the
end of this video where we actually get
myself on the on the scale again and see
if I have in fact lost any weight and I
think the other objective of this little
experiment is not just to see how
effective VR can be for losing weight
but how practical or impractical it is
as well are you just better off going to
the gym or is this actually a viable
fitness solution for weight loss where
we're about to talk about that right now
actually when I first started this 30
days ago I only included one game into
my my regimen it was hollow point and
it's a very fun game I still enjoy the
game however it only took about three or
four days in to realize that I was going
to get bored of this game really quick
so I actually ended up having to add in
two other games which were hollow ball I
played that at the beginning the first
10 minutes of every session as sort of a
warm-up you got a paddle in each hand
you got to hit this ball back and forth
against the wall it's like playing
tennis against the wall basically it's
not super intensive but it does get your
heart up a little bit and it's a great
warm-up option and then I also added in
thrill of the fight which is the boxing
game that I read about on upload VR calm
which was the only game in their list
that they tested which burned more
calories and was more intense than
hollow-point so I bought that game that
was fairly cheap and I added that I
basically split my time after the first
10 minutes in hollow-point
I'm sorry hollow ball I split the rest
of that time between hollow hollow point
and thrill of the fight so 25 minutes of
peace in those games and an holy crap by
the end of my workouts not only was i
sweating a lot more just from working
out different parts of my body in
various games but I was also enjoying
myself a bit more
as I had a bit more variety to work with
instead of just the same monotonous
routine over and over which is one of
the things I always hated about going to
the gym as infrequently as I would go in
the past it just seemed like work and
you don't really get that same
experience with VR if you are able to
switch up the games you're playing in
any given day so that's been fun I also
sort of reworked the Garmin vivofit HR
plus wristband the Fitness band to
actually work a bit better and more
effectively more accurately I think I
was switching it to cardio when I was
doing my tracking and there was an other
option that's just sort of miscellaneous
not necessarily running per se but just
other fitness activities once I switch
that over the the calorie count that I
was burning seemed to go up like like
twofold almost so the average amount of
calories I was burning per workout
session was about 550 calories compared
to like the the 200 that was initially
listed or initially recorded on day one
I think that's a little bit more
inaccurate so 550 calories per session
that's you know over 2,000 calories a
week that I'm burning which is about a
day's worth of food for me I usually
take in around 2000 ish calories give or
take so the fact that I'm burning off
one entire day per week I think is
probably going to be a good shot there's
a good chance that I have lost some
weight from a month ago my average heart
rate according to the fitness tracker
was 130 beats per minute which is right
in line actually with my target heart
rate for burning fat and whatnot I think
it's like 125 or something like that so
very close the other thing is that I
wanted to talk about the cables the hmd
cables that were tripping me up in the
beginning they are still there I
actually bought a suspension kit to wire
the the HMV cables from my ceiling to
avoid cable clutter on the floor and I
just never set that up it's just
laziness and not making time not binding
time with all the other projects I have
going on I just ended up becoming
complacent with having cables on the
floor and I also sort of reworked how I
played the games only hollow point was
was really the game that caused the most
issues there because you're constantly
spinning and twisting around
I just refrain from you know twisting
the same
direction over and over so I was never
like winding myself up like a piece of
spaghetti on a fork or something like
that but still not the most ideal
situation if I if I choose to continue
this VR workout routine I'm probably
going to have to suspend the cables at
some point just because it's just not
it's just not ideal it's not fun
another issue that I ran into was the
lenses getting really foggy after my
heart rate would come up and I would
start sweating and get hot get
physically hot and fumes would be
rolling off of my body and fogging up
the lenses to the point where I
literally could not see or it was
impairing my vision too significantly
for me to actually play reasonably and
this was mainly a problem in hollow
point because it does require accuracy
you have to actually shoot and aim and
things like that so what I ended up
doing and I realize this that my glasses
had a lot to do with it for some reason
the glasses were sort of trapping the
heat you know that was coming off of my
face and that was in turn creating more
fog it was it was causing it to fog up
significantly more than if I was wearing
contacts so I eventually switched to
contacts thinking it wouldn't make much
of a difference but it really did and
and also sort of loosening the headset
just a bit just loosening it so that
there's a little bit more breathability
instead of strapping it very securely to
your head you know you kind of have to
find that happy medium to allow some
sort of ventilation to pass through so
that was something to be aware of and
that I had to work around but eventually
it worked out and then sweat of course
wet is not a problem for everyone it's a
huge deal for me because I just have
hyperactive sweat glands and you know
you really got to take care of the
hygiene aspect of things the main thing
is the headset the visor and the foam
padding that goes right along the hmd
I've had to remove that and clean that
regularly throughout you know my my
experiment here it just gets really
nasty and you don't want to feel like
you're you know grimy or gross going
into the workout because you're using
this headset that still has like dried
sweat on it you know it's really sick so
cleaning it out to every session or so
or every other session I would highly
recommend if you're going to take on
this task yourself now the last tidbit
of information and something that I've
sort of learned to respect and
acknowledge
throughout this process is that you are
responsible you're solely responsible
for all the equipment and hardware that
you're using to work out I mean if you
go to the gym and the treadmill that
you're on breaks you don't have to pay a
dime for that that's on the gym
obviously but if you are sweating
profusely for example and some of that
sweat gets into your hmd or your
controllers and some of that Hardware
breaks you alone are responsible for
replacing that equipment and it can be
costly when you're talking about VR I
mean we are still very expensive even
though the prices have rolled back a
little bit so that's something to be
aware of and also when you're really
intense in the middle of the game you
are seeing the the virtual environment
but you're still blind in real life so
there are often times where I was
punching someone in in thrill of the
fight and I would just get way too into
it and kind of get a little too close
quarters and my controller would just
smack the headset like heart or in
hollow point when you're bringing the
arrow to the bow sometimes those those
two controllers would just smack each
other and I'd like freeze for a moment
and be like is everything okay is
everything still tracking right is it
did I break anything so that's something
to always be conscious of is that you're
using your own equipment and you'll be
replacing it out-of-pocket should any of
it fail
so after this 30-day period I would say
that VR is a workable solution to
getting fit and losing weight assuming
that it actually works and that's kind
of what we have to talk about now is did
I actually lose any weight because we've
already sort of discussed the challenges
and I think those challenges are
reasonable enough for for most people to
get around and you have to work with it
you have to work with VR as a workout
tool a little bit but if you do it
properly like I've learned how to do it
can be a good experience so that being
said is it an effective one
well first off let's talk about diet at
the beginning of this challenge I did
mention that I was going to try to curb
my diet and watch what I eat more
carefully and I've been doing that to a
degree but to be honest not I haven't
been doing it as much as I would have
liked to I've probably changed my diet
like 10 percent of what it was like it
really has been so minimal that being
said any weight that I lose today that
I've lost
we can now attribute a little bit more
to the workout portion of the extreme
as opposed to the diet one I'm pretty
much all dressed though to get on the
scale I'm wearing more or less what I
was apart from the shirt I was wearing a
pulse card wear shirt when I weighed
myself last month but this is same
material we go the same t-shirt guy no
socks no belt pants I gotta change my
pants so I'm going to change my pants
really quick and the jump on the scale
hopefully not break the scale in the
process and we'll see how much weight
I've managed to lose in 30 days from
working out in virtual reality all right
guys so here we are once again and if
you remember day one I weighed in at 167
point 4 pounds and I didn't really have
a goal in mind as to how many pounds I
wanted to lose it was just to see how
many could I lose in general so with
that said I'm going to go ahead and turn
the scale on alright so I'm going to
place my my transmitter my mic
transmitter on the side there wasn't
wearing it last time no socks all the
same all the same tricks let me go on
then I'm going to scale evenly here
ready I'm gonna stop right now
160 2.8 106 so that's almost 5 pounds
that's a four point four point six
pounds yes that is correct
I can math so nearly 5 pounds in 30 days
that's actually pretty good especially
for someone my height I'm five seven yes
I know I'm short but you can kind of see
like I guess I can sort of tell that
I've slimmed down a little bit it's um
more noticeable for me because you know
I see myself in the mirror everyday most
people probably won't notice but I
definitely do feel a tad thinner and
that's that's pretty cool so the hard
work seems to have paid off and I guess
the question now is what am I going to
continue doing this am I going to
continue working out in VR and am I
going to keep this up honestly I would
like to I it's it's been tough guys
don't get me wrong like my schedule is
so busy with the channel and whatnot
making videos for you guys that I really
had to try it was a struggle to make
that four day a week commitment and I
know it sounds lame so it's only four
hours a week but it's been pretty
difficult when you
to share your workspace with your
workout space so I've been doing
everything in my office for the last
month so that means if I'm in the middle
of a build or something like that and
I've just got parks all over the place
and I haven't done my VR workout that
day I have to clean up everything even
if I'm just you know I'm not even done
with that project I have to sort of
reset the room and open it up so that I
have room to room scale and play and
stuff so that's been pretty difficult
honestly I think maybe once I get a
studio if I can get a studio soon we're
still working on that it's a big long
process but once that locks in then I
can maybe open up that office just as a
permanent VR workout space that would be
awesome I would love to do that because
honestly in my opinion this beats the
gym hands down you don't have to deal
with other people you have to deal with
nasty machines that other people are
using it's all from your house I hate
leaving the house when I don't have to
and being able to just walk into my room
next door is a supremely convenient and
just works for my sort of lazy lifestyle
sometimes so um you guys let me know
what you think of all this what you
think of the results
can you tell can you tell in my face
have I lost any weight at all like I
honestly like I don't know I don't know
what other people are seeing you guys
you guys see me every day more or less I
mean every other day or something like
that but let me know in the comments
down below what you think and we'll talk
soon I've got some more stuff planned
for you guys in the very near future of
course as always so be sure to subscribe
so you don't miss any of that also feel
free to talk to me a like on the video
if you enjoyed it and have yourselves a
wonderful day love you guys have a good
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
