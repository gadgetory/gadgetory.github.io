doing here
oh yeah just in the area so I thought
I'd dropped in see how you're like gonna
know - OH - dude how how the hell did
you get in here
bathroom window was open so I just
crawled in through there breezy by the
way your a/c was like not even on man it
is hot and you ride a crank that these
chicks are pretty good tell me about
that one did you know that you only have
basic cable my face and face it
so did we launch a necklace not
everything belongs in your living room
for a quiet and compact companion check
out the node 2 oh 2 from fractal designs
you can find more info in the
description below what's up guys
so back in June I posted my review of
the pcs + r9 390x from power color and
apart from a few minor setbacks the card
earned my vote of confidence well this
month the Taiwanese manufacturer has
introduced a similar card to the market
that now sports a more sophisticated
cooling solution this is the power color
Radeon r9 390x devil but unlike the
fiery demon himself this card aims to
save vastly cooler than the competition
thanks to its hybrid air and liquid
cooled design under the hood however
we're essentially dealing with the same
enhanced Hawaii XT GPU on the 28
nanometer GCN 1.1 architecture with 2800
and 16 stream processing units and 8
gigabytes of gddr5 on a 512 bit bus we
do get a slight core clock bump from
1062 1100 megahertz and a 1 or 2%
increase in memory clock speed to
fifteen hundred and twenty five
megahertz since the specs here are
nothing terribly new or exciting let's
take a closer look at the real star of
the show here me I measure 67 inches
tall with a striking aesthetic and Oh
apparently it's not me it's the the
cards special hybrid cooler guess we're
saving the best for last the special
design uses an all-in-one liquid
solution to cool the GPU while a 90
millimeter fan and modest heatsink take
care of the vrm and other components a
sin
combination considering most of the heat
generated by this card will likely come
from our Hawaii XT chip they really
should have called that the devil I
should mention here that the pump block
360 millimeter long flexible rubber
tubing and 30 millimeter thick 120
radiator are all OAM components from our
friends over at ace tech power color has
included its own radiator fan but you do
have the option to swap it out for one
of your own choosing there's also
nothing stopping you from slapping on a
second fan for a push-pull setup
enclosing the core components is a black
plastic shroud with brushed metallic
plating around the vrm fan while I find
the silver accents to be a nice touch
the rest of the enclosure looks and
feels a bit like a child's toy and I'd
much rather it resemble an adult toy if
I had the choice that way I'd know it
could take a beating this comes as a
surprise when you consider the stellar
build quality of power colors more
affordable air cooled 390x the card
feels somewhat light for a cart of its
size and tapping the shroud creates an
off-putting hollow sound probably due to
the lack of a heatsink in place of the
pump block power colors devil series is
typically regarded as their select line
of video cards yet when I look at this
cooler I don't see the same premium
craftsmanship that's expected
whatever this card sold its soul to the
devil for it clearly wasn't it's good
looks on the front you get a small bio
switch four separate custom profiles a
hybrid LED that lights up white and a
single a pin and 6 pin PCI II connector
bear in mind that AMD's r9 390x has an
appetite for raw power and this hybrid
model is no exception so make sure
you've got a 750 watt power supply at
minimum when running this card up top
power color has included a reinforced
back plate with some double branding
that spans the full 270 millimeters
length of the PCB and cooler I should
also warn not to be fooled by the cards
pair of PCI slots the monstrous height
of the shroud in fact gives this card a
3 slot design which will most likely hog
if the PCI slot directly beneath it
while giving less breathing room for
that 90 millimeter fan should you opt
for a crossfire configuration finally on
the back you get a nice mix of video
outs including DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI 2.0
and 2
- link DVI now moving on to the card the
actual performance it is well known by
now that Hawaii xt isn't the best
overclocker but thanks to the cards
hybrid cooler I was able to bump the
core clock frequency to eleven hundred
and seventy megahertz
that's forty five megahertz more than I
was able to push the PCs plus 390x on
air
surely the higher clock speed would
translate to slightly better gaming
performance yes unfortunately that
wasn't the case at all oddly enough
running all five of the tests that were
used with the pcs plus 390x yielded the
same frame rates across the board in
fact the results were so identical at
most a one frame per second difference
that I didn't even bother making
benchmark slides for this card if you
want to see how the 390x devil performs
just look at the benchmarks on my pcs
plus three ninety x video because
there's virtually no performance
difference between the two in terms of
frames per second now I'm not sure if I
just got unlucky with a sluggish GPU or
if this has something to do with how
power color bends their chips but my
testing speaks for itself that if you're
expecting the chilly temps of this car
to bring home noticeable performance
gains over an air-cooled 390 X for
example you just might be disappointed
like my wife on our honeymoon perhaps
not even liquid cooling can make an
overclocking beast out of the 390x what
the hybrid cooler can do however is make
your GPU downright frosty and this is by
far and away the devil's saving grace
throughout my testing the chip stayed at
a frigid 51 degrees Celsius
a colossal 17 degrees cooler than the
pcs plus that's an incredible feat when
trying to cool a hot blooded chip like
the Hawaii XT now naturally less heat
generated means a cooler interior for
your chassis especially when paired with
a fan and a radiator to quickly dispense
the heat outside so now that I have this
big bag full of mixed feelings where
does this leave us
in conclusion well for one power color
needs to step up their build quality
game for future double branded cards to
keep its reputation of a premium product
line additionally the free 90 X wouldn't
be my first GPU of choice to slap a
liquid cooler on to given its low
ceiling for overclocking now that being
said overclockers would probably get
more mileage out of a similarly priced
GTX 9
eighty assuming they're willing to trade
an AMD set of technologies for nvidia z'
now if your heart is still set on a 390
X I would personally favor the PCs plus
model which currently retails for about
70 bucks cheaper however if you don't
plan on overclocking and superior
thermal conditions are your top priority
you probably won't find a cooler 390x on
the market than the 390x devil from
power color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
