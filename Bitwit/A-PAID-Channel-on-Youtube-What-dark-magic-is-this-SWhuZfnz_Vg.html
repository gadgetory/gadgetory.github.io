video finds you well this is just a
quick update on some of the changes that
are going on with bit wit as a business
right now I say business and not Channel
because the channel as you know it right
now this main channel is not changing in
any way same contents that same output
frequency everything is going to be
exactly the same in fact if I didn't
post this video you probably would have
no idea that any changes were even
happening so here's the deal here's
what's going on this week
I created a paid YouTube channel that's
going to basically function as an early
access content platform basically a way
for you to watch all the content that
you see on this channel a week in
advance so very similar to how vessel
operated except you're not going to have
to go to a separate platform or use a
different login it's all going to be
right here on YouTube and the pay
channel is called bit wit ultra which
was initially the name of my blog
channel which has been renamed to bit
wit too but since then I've been
thinking of ways to kind of increase the
number of revenue streams that I have
for my business I don't know if you guys
remember but I got kicked from the
Amazon affiliate program not too long
ago which I'm still trying to fight
tooth and nail to get that back it's
just an ongoing tedious process but it's
really the topic for another video on
its own but that really hurt me and and
now I'm trying to do bigger grander
things this year all the same so I'm
trying to hire my wife and the process
of hiring wifey sauce right now as a
full time employee which you can be
working with me which essentially means
she's going to have to quit her business
or at least scale down on it
tremendously which essentially means
we're going from a double to a single
income household and she's got bills
around she's got a car payment etc that
she needs stable income so I have to be
able to provide that for her with funds
that are coming from my business so
that's one of the reasons why I'm doing
this also I want to expand I want to get
a studio it's nice living inside of an
end case m1 but there's only so much you
can do sure it's functional and it gets
the job done but there's not really much
room to grow so what I'm looking for is
like a 780 T where I just have a lot
more options at my disposal and I don't
have nearly as many sacrifices that I
need to make to achieve the things that
so that's going to be a huge huge goal
for this year is try to get a dedicated
space that's not in my grandparents
house moving back to the pay channel
though the main perk is early access so
most of the content that I'm going to be
making from here on out is going to be
posting to bit with ultra a week early
and there's a phone call so--but with
ultra subscribers we'll be getting all
the same content that is posting to the
main channel just seven days in advance
now there are a couple exceptions to
this rule and that includes event
coverage so things like CES and copy
text where they're pretty time-sensitive
that all that content will be posting on
both channels at the same time and then
the other exception is highly
time-sensitive product launches or
releases such as risin GTX 1080p I Katie
like ex skylake ex all the videos that
I'm creating around these huge buzz
worthy products are going to be
launching on both channels at the same
time as well so those are the only two
exceptions everything else like you know
PC of the month live strike s live
streams with the other exception awesome
hardware is obviously not going to
stream live stream a week early on bit
with ultra so that's the third exception
there but things like PC of the month or
any other reviews that I do those are
going to be a week early also no ads on
fit with ultra so that means I'm
removing Adsense entirely I'm only going
to be getting money through the
subscription fees through that channel
so no ads no Google ads and of course
some of you guys use adblock I know a
lot of you do and I do appreciate those
of you who actually whitelist me on the
main channel right now that's that's
really super grateful for that so maybe
that's not a big perk to you well I
don't have ads anyway because I use
adblock one thing that I could say is
that I'm not I'm also not going to be
including any of my own in-house
pre-rolls
on the DeWitt Ultra channel so anything
that I've done you know all the pre
girls that I've done with like fractal
Josh in the past or would be quiet or
cable mod or like you know lynda.com
Squarespace
all those ads you're not going to see a
single one on to it'll true they will
still exist on the main channel but not
on the paid one and I know a lot of you
guys like to see those pre-rolls and you
can always catch them on the main
channel so yeah those are the two things
early access and AD free for a buck
fifty months and I've kind of decided on
that price point because I was looking
at the average contribution amount on
patreon which thank you guys so much for
contributing on that web
site and it's basically three dollars as
the average amount that people are
donating there so I kind of cut that in
half is like buck fifty for the
mainstream and also when I look at like
four or five dollar monthly
subscriptions for twitch streamers I
figure a dollar fifty is pretty
reasonable I would hope at least let me
know what you think of that as well
also I wanted to mention if you are
supporting me on patreon then consider
shifting your focus to bit with Ultra
instead because that way you'll actually
be getting something in return
for your contribution whereas on patreon
I mean I was pretty upfront that I
wasn't going to be offering any
incentives but it was just a temporary
solution to get me on my own two feet
after I got kicked from the Amazon
affiliate program so yeah I would I
would feel much better if you guys
actually got something for your your
contribution so apart from that there
should already be a video a new video up
on bit with ultra right now you guys can
go check it out I believe it's the razor
blade Pro review that I did the first
few weeks on but with ultra are
completely free so you can just test it
out and by the end of that period you
can decide for yourself whether having
early access content from me is worth a
buck fifty a month if it's not then just
back out and continue watching my stuff
on this channel and that's pretty much
it I don't think we need to complicate
it much more than that so it's fairly
straightforward guys that's pretty much
what I wanted to talk about I think I've
covered all the basics again I'll be
reading the comments if you guys have
any questions and I'm sure that there
are some questions that I don't even
have the answers to right now you might
ask them in the comments I'll be like I
didn't even think about that man that's
a good point
so maybe I'll have to do a follow-up and
this is a learning experience the first
time thing for me so I really do
appreciate all the all the advice and
all the the feedback that you guys will
be offering on this video so let's go do
it for now guys thank you so much for
watching and for listening I know that's
a lot to ask on the internet these days
with everyone having ADHD and stuff but
you guys are the real deal and I really
just want to thank you again sincerely
for everything you've done for me and
the channel up till this point so I'll
be going guys I'll see you soon in the
next video
take care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
