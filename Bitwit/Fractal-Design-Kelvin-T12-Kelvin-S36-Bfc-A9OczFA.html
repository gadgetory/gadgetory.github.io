brand new liquid coolers from fractal
design this is their Kelvin t12 and the
Kelvin s 36 now I know what you're
thinking Kyle should really wear glasses
more often they really bring out his
eyes but if you'll just refocus your
attention on the product for a minute
you might have realized that this is
fractals first attempt to bring an
all-in-one liquid cooler to market
unfortunately some of you may be set in
to hear that these models are not
currently available for sale in North
America fractals official statement
about the matter reads due to the
existing legal conflict and lawsuit
surrounding water cooling fractal design
has decided not to make this product
available for the North American market
until the court of law has ruled the
final decision by unanimous vote the
jury hereby finds the defendant guilty
of liquid cooling in the first degree
Celsius but regardless of where in the
world these products are being sold
there's been a lot of hype surrounding
the Kelvin series to see what fractal
design can do beyond the scope of cases
and power supplies in this video I'll be
conducting a thorough overview of the
two units that I have with me today
missing from the Kelvin trio is the S 24
240 millimeter cooler as the boxes and
naming nomenclature indicates the t12
has a 120 millimeter radiator while the
s 36 sports a whopping 360 and before I
explain additional differences between
the two there's a few Universal features
that apply to all three models in the
kelvin series besides the fact that
they're all compatible with the same
popular AMD and intel sockets the first
of which are the unit's copper radiators
which allow fans to deliver effective
cooling at lower speeds due to the
radiators lower density this in turn
improves acoustics and power efficiency
with your fans I have to admire fractals
relentless efforts to make silence an
iconic staple of their brand perhaps
that's why they've hired Josh to balance
things out keeping with the black and
white theme found in their chassis all
coolers come equipped with fractals
silent series HP fans with seven white
blades that spin at 1,700 rpm the fan
cables have high-quality blacks leaving
all the way up to their 4 pin pwm
connectors also included our black
sleeve fan splitters with two heads for
the t12 and three for the s 32 apart
from radiators and fans the Kelvin jet
plate has also been designed
to channel water directly through the
underlying pin array a rubber seal
directs water flow straight to the
copper plate for optimal heat
dissipation as you can see the copper
cold plate does not come with pre
applied thermal paste but instead each
cooler comes with a syringe of fractal
branded thermal interface material which
tells us this isn't their first rodeo
which it is on the side of the pump
block you'll find a dedicated fill port
for maintenance or easy refilling when
expanding your system yes that's right
all three models in the Kelvin lineup
are expandable if you want to add GPU
blocks or additional radiators in the
same loop of course with a bigger loop
comes the need for a stronger pump that
can adequately deliver healthy water
flow through your system which fractal
claims to have achieved while
maintaining quiet operation
additionally the pump offers dry run
protection that allows it to run in a
dry environment without getting damaged
meaning so few water cooling enthusiasts
these days are doing the proper research
that fractal had to innovate on behalf
of their stupidity the face of the pump
block takes on a glossing yet
minimalistic design which is sure to
look pretty badass in a define our five
build hmmm there's also a black sleeved
3-pin cable that runs from the top of
the block to power the pump measuring
approximately one foot long black tubing
was chosen to prevent contact with UV
light which can then lead to algae
growth and job stability for your pool
guy the tubes are wrapped with a stylish
metallic coil and are fairly resistant
to kinking as well to ensure
compatibility with most custom water
cooling products the Kelvin line uses
standard G quarter-inch thread fittings
fractal warns that replacing these with
potentially lower quality fittings may
not have the exact diameter and could
cause water leakage shocking evidence
that proves companies still recommend
their products over others and really
quickly with each cooler you do receive
a user's manual mounting accessories and
screws for your fans with little hex
heads that require an Allen wrench to
screw in what why what would you do that
don't do that again fractal that I as
far as Hardware differences between the
coolers go the only obvious change is
the varying radiator dimensions and the
number of fans included with each I will
say though that the t12 has a glossy
aesthetic that runs across its radiator
while the s 36 looks more akin to come
in om radiators we've seen from other
manufacturers the t12 radiator also has
a second fill port on the side opposite
of the connected tubes still upon
further investigation I learned that the
two larger coolers in the kelvin series
feature in all copper construction
whereas the t12
of implements a copper and nylon
construction making it the first of its
kind on this model copper is used where
heat transfers take place and nylon is
saved for the outer sides of the unit's
where the heat transfer is absent this
aims to help isolate the areas of heat
dissipation so that heat travels only to
the place where it can be most
effectively carried away now I would
have loved to test thermal performance
in this video but currently my testbed
is out of order and I wanted to get all
the information out on these coolers in
time for their launch so you can expect
to see a follow-up video with tempers
alts coming soon that's gonna wrap it up
for now guys let me know you think of
these new coolers from fractal and if
you think there shouldn't be legal
disputes over liquid coolers in North
America because that's just silly
