2016 is brought to you by a need for
seat go-to need for seat USA comm for
the ultimate gaming chair selection for
your desk and office I'll be ordering
mine as soon as I take this little guy
in a field trip to the meat grinder look
what you did to my chair you like just
doing everything I live don't you and
another huge shout out to the folks over
at Corsair they make good stuff what
else do you want me to say how's it
going guys we're back here for CES 2016
here at the Asus booth I'm talking to
Raja he's part of the PR department here
how's it going Raja how're you doing
today
not bad thank you absolutely fantastic
and you guys have some really nice
boards here some of which I've seen
before some of which I've only seen in
pictures on the internet so I'm kind of
curious about all of them why don't you
go ahead and run us through what the
basics are sure we've got two new
entry-level boards for the guys that
want the ROG type features but without
the overclocking or anything crazy on
the on the intel side it's the B 150 I
Pro gaming this is a mini ITX board
priced at $119 are you lighting up the
site and the supreme FX audio solution
that is famous on ROG and then on the
AMD side we wanted to do something for
the AMD fans they sometimes feel a
little bit left out so it's an old
chipset 970 but there are still people
that are very interested in this first
time ever SLI is offered on 970 from m.d
so we've got that there's also the RGB
lighting here as well again $119 so it's
priced nicely for the guys that won
those kind of systems so this is great
for you know some some users in the PC
DIY can you who might feel left out in
terms of wanting that full art rog kind
of premium look and feel in terms of
functionality and aesthetic who can now
enjoy those kinds of benefits for a
relatively nice price point yeah exactly
that's exactly who it's for if they're
not too bothered about the overclocking
side you know these these boards will
fit that perfectly an aesthetically nice
in a system nice what else do we got
over here okay so the Maximus a Xtreme
assembly so this is like the Maximus 8
Xtreme that's been out for a while now
we wanted to do it in a slightly
different color
ROG is traditionally always been red and
black but there's been an oversaturation
of that so we want to explore new
avenues so this is plasma copper so
identical to the extreme in most ways
but the assembly suffix stands for two
devices that we're bundling with this
one is an external DAC well as a USB DAC
I should say ESS saber DAC the advantage
of doing it here rather than onboard we
do a lot of onboard audio work we've
been pushing now for years now but you
still have limitations you're in a noisy
environment moving that to an external
box and having more room to lay things
out allows you to extract that last
ounce of performance and we're finding
more and more gamers are using high-end
headsets rather than gaming headsets so
this can drive seven VRMs at 600 ohms so
if you've got a high-end dad's head
saying you want to get the best from it
this is the solution it's actually
saying speaking a lot of truth because I
personally use a pair of DT AAT pros
really nice headset or headphones from
biodynamic and you're starting to see a
lot more people in the in the the
industry coming out with things like the
mod mic 4.0 right where you can actually
it's a modular mic that you can slap on
any kind of pair of headphones that you
like because typically speaking at least
for now the quality and gaming
headphones there's there's a bit of a
dearth in in terms of good quality
gaming headsets out there so people like
to combine mix and match the best of
both worlds enthusiasts are always
looking for the premium type of
experience when it comes to gaming audio
so that's a really great feature and
very nice looking board I really like
the copper I think this would look
really nice with some may be copper hard
line tubing in a custom water cool build
something like that that's very nice but
as far as like if you wanted to get even
more custom with it this board over here
is the one that I was alluding to seeing
online and Paul and I from Paul's
hardware we actually talked about this
on our live show and we're giving you
guys a lot of high praise for what you
guys have done here so why don't you go
ahead and explain that the formula
boards are always highly anticipated
especially by the modding community the
guys that do the showcase built because
of the aesthetic of the board having the
the armored look across it's very clean
but RGB lighting is becoming a bigger
thing it has been for an
of years motherboard vendors have been
introducing it but it hasn't been done
very well you're either fighting that
the color of the board there's always
some accents on the board which doesn't
make sense if you're doing a themed bill
to a different color so we wanted to do
a monochromatic rog board first time
ever no color accents so it goes with
anything so what we've done we've taken
the best zones put 28 LED RGB LEDs in
them and they're fully controllable so
we have us or a software package that
works on the lower end boards to is the
same package allows you to select any
number of effects
there's breathing you can do it with
music CPU temperature pulsating effects
in addition to that there is also an RGB
header that is compatible with 5050
strips supports up to 2 amps and 2
meters effectively of strip we provide
an extension cable so your LEDs aren't
starting from here you get some room you
can even have that operating in unison
with the effect that you're applying
here or you can have it so it operates
on independently so for the guys that
want to trick out their lighting this is
the perfect that's great as that
obviously gives you a ton of flexibility
here probably the most flexibility I've
seen the motherboard here so far at CES
all right we've scuttled about two feet
from where we just were and we're taking
a look at some really flashy looking
peripherals here which I don't think
I've seen before I have seen some of the
conceptualized ideas that are going on
here at Computex but we have a mouse and
a keyboard and they both look awesome
what can you tell us about it
yeah this it has been unveiled before
but they've gone through iterations from
feedback from people like yourself
that's right and from gamers we've
talked to a lot of people who wanted to
hit the high end space but do things
that people were really looking for
hadn't been done before so first of all
we've got the spatha Mouse it's wired or
Wireless aimed at the MMO crowd has got
lots of thumb buttons 8200 dpi and it's
got a magnesium alloy chassis so it's
nice and lightweight nice and big as
well so it suits all types of grips you
know and the buttons are elongated for
that so yeah it's really cool goes up to
2,000
and magnet Huntsville polling rate very
nice I actually had a chance to mess
around with it a bit it's extremely
comfortable I personally am a claw grip
user and but I tested it out with palm
rest as well both seem to be extremely
comfortable and all the buttons feel
amazing are they using armor on switches
they've got armor on switches which you
can replace then we first did with this
with the Gladius so if you like a
different click force the mouse opens up
and you can change the switches to
something else
very nice being very well-received yeah
and there's there's quite a few LEDs
going on it as well are these
configurable and software is this RGB as
well
RGB multiple zones okay so yeah it will
all tie back to to the motherboards as
well
excellent and and we've also got even
more RGB goodness going over here on the
keyboard with a nice little module here
on the numpad which is is actually
modular and can be put on either side of
the keyboard correct yeah you can have
it on either side for the guys that like
their mouse closer to the keyboard so
they're not straining their shoulder
whether with a wider you know angle you
can put this on the other side so it
suits or you can take it off all
together depending on what your
preferences are but in addition to doing
stuff like that we're really hot on
integration we've got our fingers in
multiple pies and we're doing stuff very
well so we're we've got motherboards
we've got GPUs we've got monitors we're
in the networking space and we're
leading in multiple categories we're not
just a part-time player what we want to
do is integrate our peripherals with
that hardware so when the user buys an
rog motherboard and one of our keyboards
they get an experience that's enhanced
over what they would get if they did it
another way so on this keyboard there
are hardware keys that allow you to
overclock the motherboard with one
button so there's a cpu OC profile
embedded there's XMP you can apply that
without having to go into BIOS or flick
any switches on the board it makes it
very very simplistic boot to BIOS button
which allows you to enter the UEFI
without having to jam the Delete key
which is people infamously hey thank you
in advance for implementing that feature
it's gonna save a lot of heartache yeah
and then we talked about the lighting
which is a big deal for people that want
to do everything synched up
there's an ROG sync and it syncs back
the hora software so whatever feature or
that you've selected or color it will
immediately be transposed here that's
that's great
do we have any pressing or availability
on both of these we're looking around q1
pricing on both is TBD so watch this
space all right sweet well you guys
heard he got that on camera right he's
got samples for me so now you're
obligated but thank you so much Roger
for all of the info that you shared with
us today enjoy the rest of your time
here at CES all right guys we are still
here at the AC suite they've got a lot
of cool stuff here but this is probably
one of the coolest I'm here talking to
David and he's about to tell us a little
bit about this external graphics card
unit that can be used to really expand
the functionality and the power just the
sheer horsepower of your laptop and
really create some really great things
with it so we have seen other things
like this in the past
external GPUs but there's a lot that's
changed since the last time we took a
look at those so what's kind of
different about this new iteration of
hardware this thank you and this is our
new axis station - we had one axis
station one back in 2007 but this year's
the Penguins has finally be enough to
make this dream come true we use
proprietary USB type-c connect to our
laptop it powers your laptop and it has
a USB hub inside so all your gears all
your keyboard mouse has ads monitor
everything will be hooked up to this
station when you are going out to school
going to work all you have to do is to
bring your laptop you will no longer
need a gaming tapped laptop and a
working laptop all you need is just one
connect your laptop to this station you
will become gaming desktop right away so
we believe this will be the new form
factor of kemon pcs well thank you David
this looks really really great so far is
there any kind of pricing or
availability like currently that you can
share with us we haven't decided price
yet
you will be available in 2016 awesome
