the Netherlands here in Amsterdam and
we're just been in a couple more days
here before we head back home how's that
toast that toast is definitely relaxed
you yeah you look pretty compote right
now oh you're just jelly because I'm
vlogging and you're not did you get the
jelly fun though you get that one level
up your game with the Corsair strafe
mechanical keyboard featuring Cherry MX
switches dynamic lighting control and
endless programmability enjoy the
comfort of premium contoured key caps
and get connected with built-in USB
pass-through click the link in the
description to learn more this is
beautiful canal that we're walking down
kind of concerning though that there's
no like guardrail or sort of fence here
people just kind of fall in like like
these people right here they're about to
fall and watch please God for a miracle
if you're gonna make a miracle happen
make it now damn it well maybe we'll get
lucky on the way back and it'll probably
be me is it just me or did they totally
steal the Sega font here I think that
store should get a strike wow there's a
Darth Vader just stand-in here in the
Market Square I don't think there's
anything that could possibly be cooler
than that right now oh never mind
that was a short reign you're next right
there freely I give up
dier an arts prek too good you gotta
give up again where did that damn hotel
go oh there it is built in 1514 this is
the oldest building in the town of edom
coincidentally it's right next to the
newest cocktail lounge oh god I hope all
these cars are using their emergency
brake hey honey I think there's a vegan
shop right over there you should
probably go check it out
this is caramel waffle liqueur to your
extract of a stroopwafel now it's
probably not accurate but we are at a
scoop waffle bakery and we're about to
eat lots of diabetes
hopefully the alcohol percentage is
pretty low because this is dangerously
easy to drink you are going to finish it
and make a yes are you ready sure okay
so press on the waffle make it nice and
round we have the waffle and I have to
split the waffle
put your head like this fight with the
waffle and with the other hand you put
the caramel on top and the best way is
to put on enough the first time then
it's easy to spread it and a cookie
won't break a lot of rules no pressure
if you think a little bit more perfect
you can put the waffle on the table you
put the other one on top and then you
press a little bit in the middle yes and
then you hold it up and everybody can
see that everybody who makes a waffle
here in the bakery follow them
gets a nice certificate
all right so here's a quick room tour
this is our room that's the room tour
okay moving on let's see here we've got
good a video uploading the one bad thing
about this hotel room is that the Wi-Fi
sucks and I haven't been able to
actually find out where in the room gets
the best signal there actually was a
brief moment when putting the laptop
right here by the coffee stuff was
actually getting some decent signal but
that seems to have passed uploading 1%
it's been like that at 1% for about 15
minutes now you'll notice there's not
even any like sort of ETA countdown or
whatever which means it's going really
really slow so I'm actually gonna run
down to the hotel lobby with the laptop
and see if the Wi-Fi connections better
there no don't do that no one wants to
see that you're embarrassing yourself
that scared me so you get alright in the
hotel lobby but it doesn't really seem
to be doing much for us we're at 2% now
it's been about five minutes I'm going
to try somewhere else all right we're at
Starbucks now wait you got a little
coffee you used to be hard but now it's
like butt saggy butt over your saggy
butt but anyway we're getting 0.76
megabits per second hub which is
absolutely abysmal since we've been here
we'd literally have to be here all day
in order for this video to upload so
this is another fail I'm starting to
think I'm not gonna be able to upload
any more videos until I get back home
which really sucks
cake time meeting some traditional Dutch
pancakes like he got the version with
Japanese almond and I decided to indulge
and be super fat today and got the
strawberry banana and hazelnut chocolate
drizzle and
no regrets alright so you know that
Dutch pancake place that we're at right
now well I noticed that they had free
Wi-Fi so I thought what the hell might
as well try to upload and this place
actually has better up speeds than our
hotel and the Starbucks combined so I'm
just gonna sit here for the next 20-30
minutes try to get this thing uploaded
yes
I'm sure some of you guys are wondering
about the whole weed situation in
Amsterdam can you smoke weed in
Amsterdam is it really is accessible and
public as everyone says it is
for the most part yes they basically
call them coffee shops they're located
literally everywhere throughout the city
it's kind of confusing too because some
of the coffee shops here are just
regular coffee shops and they do not
sell weed you kind of have to use your
best judgement to figure out whether or
not it's the kind of coffee shop you're
looking for it's also kind of weird
because weed is actually illegal in the
Netherlands but yet coffee shops
flourish everywhere and the government
pretty much turns a blind eye to the
whole scene and I've never seen
countless people smoking weed even on
the streets even though it's technically
not legal and in case you guys are
wondering if wifey saucer I have
partaken in any of these festivities the
answer is that an ambulance sounds funny
and even the sirens here speak a
different language wife and sauce is
leading us to the vegan fast food
restaurant mouth this is our third time
here first few times they did not have
the shawarma that she was looking for
it was either sold out or not ready so
we'll see if third time's the charm
what's busy
so that again waiting
well the schwarmann wasn't ready but
they were kind enough to make it to
order for us so we got wifey swarm oh
pretty good worth it
that looks like it yes solid yes Islands
pretty good too
there are a metric ton of bicycles here
in Amsterdam about a third of the locals
makes their way by bike every single day
a lot of the roads here are dedicated to
bikes exclusively and it can be quite
dangerous if you're not sure what you're
doing as a pedestrian you can easily get
hits they also have a saying here in
Amsterdam if you hear a bell run like
hell and so far that's been pretty
accurate in my experience there's also a
ton of candy shops here in Amsterdam
before you look I've been trying my best
to not indulge with the candy side of
things but a very last day here I I
failed I failed hard so we had a fancy
dinner place now celebrating our
three-year anniversary everything's
lovely so far drinking some wine - mines
gone all right there we go
ceremonial soup or here it is that
presentation though I do not get to I
got these tasty oysters I'm gonna stuff
my face with right now
all right very big and sound that
actually looks pretty damn well I'm
sorry I got bronze hardware Bron coming
soon
and that is how you cut the cheese we're
in the little town of Samsa Shan's
they've got a ton of windmills doing
their thing except there's no wind so
they're pretty much useless looks like
everyone's got the day off today things
are about to get cheesy
alright guys that is going to conclude
this short little vlog hopefully you
guys enjoyed it I'm gonna give out of
here I'm actually headed back to LA
right now we're on our flight as you can
see my sauce is all ready to go
and thanks for watching I'll see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
