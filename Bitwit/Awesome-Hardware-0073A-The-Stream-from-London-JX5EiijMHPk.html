slider it's asked Paul shuffle Premier
Cru cider and it's quite tasty it's it's
very light and crisp and pretty dry very
rude right it's like dry but it's good
it tastes good it's very refreshing I
like it seven percent so you know better
than your typical to get there alright
we are now theoretically streaming to
both twitch and YouTube ok cool could
you check YouTube because yeah whereas
we set YouTube to be 720 resolution the
output on hey that's fine though it's
good that looks it looks totally fine
we're at seven twenty hybrid seventh
that's cool what's golden baby all right
golden voice delay yeah there's probably
a bit of uh it's I mean it's it's not
bad it's maybe a second if that I
noticed that when we cuz we also had
different mic solutions we were gonna
use and we ended up using just a very
simple USB mic that you guys can
probably see right there yep and yeah I
didn't have quite time to sink that up
but hey welcome to awesome hardware
everyone yes this is episode 73 and like
pulse out it's going to be a shorter
show because we are abroad we are in
London right well not exactly in London
we're just on the outskirts of London
Mayor Don Madeline our but maybe about
half an hour out we are here for a
special event I don't want to give
anything to to to revealing away right
now I don't think we're allowed to yeah
I don't think we can yeah um can't tell
you guys why we're here but you'll
you'll figure it out eventually but
we're here will tell you eventually um
so yes we have a shorter show today
we're still doing in two halves so this
is the first half on my channel if
you're watching us on YouTube and then
after we cut we're going to go ahead and
switch over to pulse channel on pulse
hardware so make sure that you catch his
channel right after this half ends and
you can find the link to his channel in
the description if you if you want to
watch the whole thing and then also
we've got twitch Thank You twitch for
being here hey twitch our beloved twitch
crew twitch is going to just we're gonna
string the whole thing to twitch we're
not gonna we're not even gonna cut in
the middle it's just going to be one
long continuous stream awesome that's
how we do things here but i guess i'm
with the show right we've dilly-dallied
long enough so we've got a couple things
to just quickly announced we're going to
go over them
briefly we've got stuff that we're
selling in our stores I'm selling shirts
everything should be mostly in stock I
think someone said that the CPU cooler
shirt was out of stock but it's only in
a particular size on which one is the
most sluggish screen change I think I've
ever seen xsplit do oh really that's all
right it still did it was it just like
super gradual oh yeah it was a very very
slow fade like ten ten thousand
milliseconds but yes i'm selling shirts
in my store you can pick up a bios flash
her shirt or one of the estate positive
shirts all that good stuff hey Paul's
also selling stuff in his store Paul's
hardware net can either pick up one of
his new tri-blend shirts in the
thumbscrew logo yeah yeah um and he's
got pint glasses mugs hoodies polos all
that can sort of thing where did the
Twitter my store to shame quite frankly
oh yeah this is the new new thumbscrew
logo shirt now available in a tri blend
very soft yet very comfortable everyone
everyone by that I was wearing the
original version of that shirt or one of
the original versions of that shirt
really actually on the plane yeah we do
have a beer tonight wore my thumb screws
repro we are in England so I'm drinking
from the Marlow brewery which I have no
ID no nothing about this brewery it it
could be a really good brewery but they
were serving it here at this state that
we're staying at which is pretty nice
this is rebellion read from the Marlow
brewery it's four-point-five percent
alcohol and it's pretty tasty barinash
and I already told you guys what I'm
drinking how's that cider got some cider
um all right let's uh let's dive right
in here with our first segment which
like I said this is going to be a
shorter episode so this is actually my
only segment this is the one segment for
Kyle and all i have written in the show
Doc for the name of this new segment is
its is mix that's appropriate because
it's going to be a mixture Paul of all
the various segments that I usually do
on my half the show oh well that's I'm
just cooked consolidating and condensing
it all into one super segment see that's
fun that's what I did as I niggas mixes
a genius branding name everybody clever
this particular segment never been used
before I no no it's not trademarked by
me so I'm the first article or the first
mini segment sub-segments if you will is
going to be news and
we have one news article for today in
the news sub segments and that's about
de nouveaux have you heard of des
nouveaux uh yeah we talked about a
little bit before on the show it's a
CIDR m yes scheme or ace yeah it's a DRM
platform for a lot of popular games out
there for PC gaming what have you
including rise of the Tomb Raider and
this was the first time that it's been
documented the de nouveaux this drm
management software has been actually
hacked non hacked beyond repair they're
actually yeah as for now hacked beyond
repair where the folks over at de
nouveaux or whoever owns it has not been
able to patch or block this particular
hack so um like I said the Hat comes
with rise of the Tomb Raider so it's
getting completely bypassed the de novo
drm and they can't do anything about it
for now so they're still working on it
though it's pretty it's pretty I don't
know I guess it's good news if you're a
pirate honestly if you really think
you're gonna enjoy the game you want to
support the developers you can just buy
the game especially if it's res the tomb
raider because that's an awesome kidding
i just had my first chance to actually
play today on the plane but today
where's that rawness today i guess it
was sort of man just barely depends on
which country you're in it's weird when
you travel it is distances and time time
travel is weird but yeah it's great game
it's also on sale right now for thirty
five percent up on the humble store
there's a big square enix sale
apparently so no need to pirate just
just buy azor by the things dirty
developers dirt cheap yo it was an
interesting thing when it first came out
cuz most games that have drm built into
it do get cracked pretty quickly and
this one just was apparently really well
done yeah i'm very challenging exactly
um but it just goes to show that the
more challenging you make something like
this the more there are hackers who will
say like no challenge accepted anything
can be hacked yeah they have to prove it
it's a total challenge accepted thing so
but you know de novo is not going
anywhere they're just going to continue
it's just like an ongoing thing right
they make newton a new drm platform and
the hackers take you know a little bit
of time to crack it and once they do
then it's just a cycle right they're
just constantly topping one another
but so far ya des nouveaux has been one
of those drm management software's that
have really taken a very long time for
the crackers to crack so good job to you
des nouveaux I suppose for protecting
the integrity of games and their
developers good job all right next up
we've got hard hard hard and pardon
hottie hot and heavy hard way Arden
hottie have where heavy heaven Hardy
head where you'd think our English
should get better when we come to
England no the no accents have really
thrown me off so hot and heavy hardware
article is about EK this is on
overclocked 3d net and EK water blocks
um actually kaiza hell that's not gonna
what isn't UK a British no they're
Swedish or no are they in the UK I throw
in the UK I always forget we're like
specifically there I I do two questions
there in Europe alright we're close
enough to EK right now they're probably
down the street yeah they're near um so
that's why we're talking about them and
also because they just launched the beta
version of their custom water-cooled
configurator app on their website which
is pretty cool actually if you guys are
familiar with cable mod they do
extensions and LEDs I've done some like
ads them in the past well they've got
like their cable mutt configurator where
you actually have a graph and you can
like you know select your colors and
actually like plan it all out there's
like a diagram and stuff it's really
useful for people who don't really know
what they want kind of the same deal
here but a little bit more complex
because you're dealing with a bunch of
different parts for a custom water cool
build Paul and I both know this we've
been doing some custom water hole builds
lately and it can get really really
complicated very quickly if you don't
know what you're doing yes I'm kind of
like the first time I built a pc i was
sort of overwhelmed by all the options
of choice that you have and not really
knowing you know what goes where and and
things like that so the configurator is
really good for people who want to want
to try out custom Oracle you take a
whack at it but just have no idea where
to start or you know what kind of parts
they should be buying or they're not
subscribed to jay's two cents or
something like that and they just they
don't know anything about water cooling
but it's pretty cool like I said it's in
the beta so it's still got some bugs and
there's some minor issues however
according to the article EK is still
like dropping up
it's on it like constantly now and
they're fixing issues there you know
taking out bugs and stuff like that and
they're also adding new hardware options
that's good the app as well also if you
guys are interested and you want to
print try your luck EK is raffling away
every 20th order for free that's so if
you use the their their app here the
configurator and you happen to be that
one of the 20th a multiple of Coney
order you could potentially just get
your whole order for free um but I
wouldn't gamble too hard on that don't
like buy it likes to spend like three
thousand dollars hoping that you're
gonna get it and you end up having to
pay 3,000 or but and then also there
also I guess if you order anything from
their configurator application before
August twenty-eighth you're you're
automatically entered for a raffle for
an msi gtx 1080 Seahawk and assume you
guys like to uh some of you guys are
feeling lucky so out if you guys are if
that's the case for you then you can go
ahead and give that a shot while taking
a tour of their new configurator app
thank you very much Zach for the
donation thanks I appreciate it glad you
like to show you got a question for us
to get a core i3 6100 on a-z 170 with it
with 16 gigs of DVR for with the will
the i3 bottleneck the GTX 1070 thinking
of picking up one of the near future um
yes I think it potentially might it
depends on what what kind of game you're
using it for I don't think it's a very
good pairing especially as you know
years go by like a couple years down the
line I think you're going to start to
run into more issues with with the core
i3 paired with that card um but you're
on Z 170 so you can technically get you
know any other core i5 potentially I
think if you got a core i5 and um you
know I would say go with a unlocks Q
because you're you have the option to
overclock on that platform that might be
better i would give it a shot but
actually zach on my half of the show
i'll be talking briefly about annan
antec article that they just posted i
believe today or yesterday where they
tested all of the i3's from intel the 51
watt TDP ones and i found actually hold
up in games in a lot of situations but
once you start to get into stuff that's
more heavily multi-threaded
is where you start to see them suffer so
yeah it'd be a little lopsided pairing
it with the 1070 but you should be able
to get by at least for now I would say
it's okay as long as you're planning to
upgrade that cpu eventually yeah yeah
exactly um alright so we've got the
games report yay games game for one
again one article for games report no
lower thirds the this this week sorry
sorry guys be very much those back in
America yes we did so we've got United
States of America these these um these
articles coming out everyone's all the
rage about no man's sky oh yeah no man's
sky comes out this friday i believe on
the twelfth of august watches friday it
says here yep and um holy smokes this i
remember first hearing about this game
like over a year ago was that forget
which convention it was shown at if it
was a packs or an e3 but everyone just
went apeshit now it's finally coming out
the game apparently went gold one or two
months ago meaning just a ton
people download like an early version i
don't know if it was legitimate or not
but that 500,000 that might have in the
beta i'm not sure is it the same in
records were it's 500,000 i believe
seven two thousand ago cold yeah and
then again to go play i could be wrong
about that no yeah that sounds about
right hmm um well if you if you're on
YouTube then the million news wait
million is platinum lilium is a bigger
silver is it just a big your silver
you're right it no is it no it's gold
this is a lyrical silver play button the
bigger ones yeah you're a gold it's 10
million subs for the diamond is a
diamond one I think so really I think I
I don't know guys let me know if that
was a joke i remember seeing that online
i was like there's a diamond one for
like 10 million so but i don't know if
it was just a parody or if it's like
actually think it should be um but
that'd be cool anyway i'm getting way
off topic here yeah a little bit um but
so yeah the game's been doing
phenomenally well in terms of feedback
although it's not super accurate because
it's not a completely finished game yet
it hasn't even hit the stores like
retail version but there's going to be a
huge update on day one of its launch
this friday and it's going to be update
1.03 this would be a ton of new
additions that are really going to I
don't make the game pop and it should be
pretty exciting if you're if you've been
waiting for this game for a long time
the up
sounds pretty cool some of the things
that includes is the three paths model
so basically you have the initial choice
at the start with the starting your game
to go three different paths it's kind of
like choose your story choose your
adventure tips here's your adventure and
pay based on your your choice of either
three one of the three it's going to
significantly impact the rest of your
gaming experience for that for that
campaign also it's just going to
increase the the updates really going to
make the galaxy's a lot larger so up to
ten times bigger you might see some
galaxies grow just exponentially with
the update planets with dead moons are
going to be a thing and so that's you
know going to introduce you low or
extremely dangerous atmospheres
potentially very hazardous variations
and atmospheres environments terrains
spaceships and others have all done
everyone let me fix the camera oh did it
freeze okay do we freeze yep thank you
all for letting us know yay we gave
twitch a little heads-up prior to going
live to YouTube that our camera has been
freezing here and there yeah again we're
have a mobile setup it's not ideal at
all so thank you for letting us know and
hopefully it should be working
apparently it froze on like a weird face
of mine cuz everyones like the house
baby face by the time of my face um
alright I've got a great pause face and
then we've got what else do we have here
boosted inventories to help promote
exploration in the game there's a more
complex trading system several several
hundred upgrades for game balancing with
advanced techniques applied to space
combat planet surface combat and more
also tweaks for improved graphical
effects stability and removal of cheats
and exploits again this is the first of
many big updates to the game so um it
seems like the developers are really
excited about it and that they're just
they have it seems like they have so
many ideas for it they have to release
in these giant patches what's at the
staff of the game is huge it is yeah
exactly so she's going to be constantly
evolving which is really cool I flip
side to this all free that's upside to
this is they are doing you know they're
doing a major launch patch and
everything so there have been some early
reviews and commentary and stuff that
have come out on this game and I
I haven't had a chance to read too many
of them but I did read some headlines it
seems you know some people seem to be a
little bit more critical of it based on
you know certain expectations that came
out of there so do you think this like
late patch coming out like right as a
game launches that promises significant
changes like is going to spoil it was
that a good thing because the developers
are putting more effort in the game and
developing it more or is it a bad thing
because it means people are really going
to have a very difficult time at least
for the first few days after launch
actually assessing how the game is
performing if they're just gonna buy it
straight up well I think it's kind of
like reviewers jumped the gun by
reviewing the game early before it even
launched that's true just so I think I
think I think it's only fair to start
reviewing the game once this day one
patch is released because it's not like
the developers Gabe gave out copies to
these reviewers early the reviewers just
happen to grab a copy of the game before
this big patch and started reviewing it
as is but the devs are saying that's not
actually indicative of how the day one
experience is going to be so I think we
just you know given the benefit the
doubt let them do their day one patch
and then assess it you know from that
point forward so everyone go play on
Friday and tell us if it's good yes
because we probably won't be able to uh
and then our second to last segment here
which eels to fund or not to fund yay
again one article one link a mini to
Thunder not too fun I like this this is
just like cutting through really quick
it straight to the point this is the cow
a robot are one horrible name I just
flow at all it's the first world's first
robotic suit case this is an IndieGoGo
campaign and Paul and I are just going
to quickly assess and see is this
something that we would potentially
invest it so last week i believe it was
we had a suitcase on indiegogo that you
could ride you could physically get on
there was motorized and you could ride
around your airport on your suitcase it
doubled as a go-cart basically and there
were a couple of times today as we were
traveling today and yesterday we sort of
wanted one I was Kenneth the edges I
wouldn't say wanted one but I was in a
spot where I was like this is what that
was made for is this yes walk a little
bit that we have to do it exactly where
is like a quarter-mile stretch and it's
just super packed is it as useful though
if it's just a robot suitcase that
follows you around
a little r2 d2 or does it need to be
something you can sit on and ride
yourself I don't know that's the
question I think it is because that I
think both have pros and cons right yeah
I don't think you look as stupid with
this thing as you do with sitting on the
other one um however you're still at
you're still having to walk the
walking's not terrible as long as you're
not carrying anything you know I mean
like it's it's fine to walk a few miles
if you're just you're just walking you
not have any heavy luggage to carry
around um my concern with this is I
would just be paranoid the whole time
like looking over my shoulder to make
sure it's to make sure it's still there
and so I didn't just swipe it swipe a
rolling bag um and I know it's probably
unlikely but it does happen and I think
just my mentality would be it would it
would cause more concern than it might
be worth yeah and that's not that's not
the case for everyone so people just
might be totally fine with you know just
letting it tail like it's like when
parents like let the kids like follow
them like they're not really like
looking at their kids but they just
assume that the kids are gonna need to
be following them wherever they walk
like like ducks if the kids not smart
enough to follow you and they just let
him go just if they don't deserves let
the kid have a good life should be yeah
like adults are afraid of their kids
falling down the stairs it's like lookie
they fall down once they learn the
lesson stay tuned for a preview at a
Paul's new book on parenting thanks
totally I totally have the the right
things hey good to know that's close
enough I have two dogs and so there's
essentials there's a side following mode
you can set it up in so basically it
attracts the rid the wrist water use if
it's on your side you know like look
over your shoulder or anything but if it
gets too far it sets off an alarm yeah
buzzes hey forgot your yeah and so it's
got GPS built in so you can track where
it is if you like left in a cab
somewhere you can follow that and Scott
you can do it you could use it
automatically or manually so if you grab
it obviously you can use it as a regular
suitcase it's also got a battery pack in
it so so did the other one the motorized
one had a battery pack for charging
mobile devices and stuff with like a
couple USB ports but I like how this
one's removable so you actually take the
battery pack out fixing the video oh I'm
on taco and on top of that good call
well we're only NEC like four comments
about
because i fixed it so quickly yeah um so
I mean I don't know it's I would have to
try both of them out I feel like but I
think right now I'm leaning more towards
don't you could ride that seems like if
you're gonna have something that makes
you look like a lazy douchebag you might
as well be sitting on it exactly my dear
right I mean that's my yeah that's where
I came from uh here's all right so
here's here's kind of an out-there
situation right because when I saw this
I was like all right when you're walking
there and there's just a bag that's
following you and it's like clearly it's
for travel so it's going to be in
airports like the footage is at airports
and airports is always a question of
security when it comes to like bags that
are left by themselves right you know
you never supposed to have a bag let's
left anywhere a trio and the Olympics
they've already detonated like three or
four or five backpacks that it were just
left somewhere because that's their
policy with it they're like we're not
going to touch it we're not gonna try to
figure out what it is we're gonna blow
it up yep and move on with our lives
yeah so really out there theory here all
right one if you're just walking along
with this and let's say it fails or
something and then just sits there
yourself right that's one thing all
right how about this if you're if you're
a bad person an evil person you got the
bag right the rolling bag and you put
your bad stuff in there like I say what
it is I'm given anybody ideas just
people view nefarious things don't take
a little following tracker bracelet and
like pop it in somebody's backpack or
something or like have it follow them
because I'm workbook and then they walk
into the airport in this bags following
them along and then you've implicated
them mmm I'm just saying I'm just from
this that is it could happen that is a
really great idea because if you're an
evil person yeah but only if you're an
evil person right which is none of us
are thankfully no no one watching this
show is nope so you know what that's
agreeable that's weird because I don't
like the idea of it like stopping like
if it if it lost range or something or
like your your your receiver on your on
your risk that's how it follows you is
that you've got a wrist band yeah looks
kind of like a watch or whatever but if
one of those things is you know going to
lose signal the bag just gonna fall
behind you and you might not notice it
you know it's noisy at an airport you're
not going to like hear it stop well
that's where that's where
alarm is supposed to go off I guess
that's where the alarm would go on but
but it but if this dies yeah like
whatever you know that's a point of
failure um then you're sick suitcases
just sitting in the middle of an airport
that looks really sketchy it does I
remember when when Heather and I were
going to I think it was we were thailand
thailand i think it was maybe Thailand
when we were in customs or something we
were going through like the the line Nia
blind goes like Zig zagged like this
there was just a suitcase in the middle
of this line and was just sitting there
and we went around the whole thing and
it just SAT there and we were like kind
of just a little bit nervous just like
why is that her suitcase just sitting
there no one's grabbing in here and it
turned out it was just some dude who was
lazy as and like was going by left
his suitcase right here and then would
wait until he went all the way around
the line to pick it up no I was with you
there oh you were with it that was
coming back from Taiwan okay was yeah
yeah I was just like why would you do
that yeah that's why it just like just
hey just take your bag with you yeah
first off your lazy ass hole and second
people could get the wrong idea and sort
of freaking out let's hear your in
customs you know you're in custody you
don't do anything that they're not
accustomed to there you go um but four
hundred and forty nine dollars okay so
remember the one that you could ride the
motorized one there's like a thousand
that was a thousand so this is half the
price now that might change things for
me because a thousand I thought was
pretty yeah way too much for a gimmicky
suitcase yeah so 449 I mean and it all
it also looked a bit more durable like
it just looks kind of more reinforcement
stuff I mean it seems to have the the
sturdy outer shell behind its going to
built-in lock and stuff it's got a you
know it's um yeah these little wheels
that they'll watch the video of the PSA
the wheels pop down much like an
airplane I think their exact landing
it's exactly the same thing I don't know
just certain marketing things like
trying to me I mean it's got the fancy
wrist you know unlock it with your
wrists yeah near field communication
whatever rfid you like cream on your
device ugh
you're an OGG yeah um thank you this it
doesn't this I will say this is nice for
a km backpack is it just an extra
external slot where you can store your
laptop or other stuff that you might
have to take up for security true Thank
You critical hit for the donation Paul
you're one even what hey
I'll give that how I was raised where or
born depending on whether my dad is
taking mad at my dad was people need my
dad's double set of edition uh all right
and our last segment here for today oh
yes yes face off days off we have a very
complex game I actually went all out for
this segment out of all of them I want
to really put a focus in here uh oh we
can refresh the camera frozen I'm really
glad you figured out how to fix it on
the fly though cuz everybody I would
have been a game-breaking problem yeah
just having to restart or something okay
not be good um well I have everything
else though everything's really going
pretty smooth yeah I'm happy with that
so clean so for face off today which is
a usually Paul and I go head-to-head in
a two-player game I thought it'd be fun
if we instead of doing an online game
like we usually do lick on a flash
website we did a game real life okay so
i was thinking rock paper scissors
because this is a game of skill because
it's a game of skill and it's very
interesting okay and well and i couldn't
they say that this is this is all right
well this will be obviously the first
round of many in a Grand Championship
Series so it's we're gonna do we're
gonna do best 13 out of 10 this is for
13 out of 20 cuz there Tina no I don't
even know if that makes sense we're
gonna fess 30 mile of another 20 i think
it's 1120 here we're gonna do three out
of five okay um so it's gonna be like
you know like the Olympics okay that's
Olympic rulesets yep appropriate this is
one of the potential Olympic sports I
think they're working on yeah we should
have been training all year so like
hearts people are saying hard starts to
be a good name to begin to play in
England I'm actually really good at
hurts are you know I will gladly take on
anyone in my dad's good hearts but he
never taught me so I suck it's all about
like
it's all about either low balling
everywhere or just going for the shoot
in the moon and yeah it's always the
accomplishment got you my dad taught me
that like as you're playing the game and
you go to shoot the moon you have to
have it all planned out in your head and
you have to be counting cards and
watching the other cards that come out
so that's our point with six or seven
cards left in your hand you can just lay
them down and be like the rest of mine
and then you like walk these stand up
and start doing like tell Vic thrust in
your face yes faison's now you go like
that that's good sport my jet that's
conservative I saw the cards Oh God
right so all right so uh best three to
five rock paper scissors and the and the
loser will have to face the consequences
yes that's it are we and as a one to
shoot or 1 2 3 shoot I say 1230 I
usually go one to shoot on to shoot all
right yep how's the kind of guy likes to
shoot from the hip all right all right
mods and chat you guys keeping score cuz
you know we can't cuz we can we just
don't know drag lose-lose toll track
already hey you got you got your
platform ready yeah I'm training I just
want to make sure we can see it oh yeah
you wanna do what if the video locks it
right pieces right at the last moment oh

one to shoot oh hell I I am really used
to 1 2 3 shoot I'm sorry I'm sorry ok
that was a false start alright yeah ok
 i already know i'm super shoe I
wasn't looking I didn't even see ok all
right here we go dear much alright so
that's that's one for you let's go again
what damn it here we go haha alright so
do 11 all right Oh down to the wire who
do you this is closed it's a big how
think 22 anything I didn't think Rock
Paper Scissors would be so intense
really that's the problem is you can't
think on you drink and drink builds up
the anticipation then
lots of drinks tension rising great 12

any Americans ethic oh boy ok so the the
punishment for face off today is that

phrase every time they take a drink of
the drink ok so i have a actual website
with a list of 50 british phrases that
Americans just don't understand and so
