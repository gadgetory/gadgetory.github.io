that you said that the core 500 toaster
can fit full-sized video cards and AIO
liquid coolers but dude I can't even fit
the motherboard in the damn thing so
what's the deal so if that's not the
core 500 hippie huh don't Barney monkey
don't get it open to the core 500 from
fractal design provides top-class
cooling and supports full size hardware
and a compact design click the link in
the description to learn more bread
toasting only supported with AMD chips
what's up guys so with new Pascal and
Polaris offerings just around the corner
in 2016 it hardly seems worthwhile to
talk about the current generation of
GPUs which have already been
exhaustively reviewed and tested since
their release sources are actually
saying that the hype train for these
cards is now being driven by an amateur
semiconductor okay I feel really bad
that I just told you guys that joke so
I'm gonna shoot myself in the face now
at the same time some of you thrifty
builders out there might be able to snag
a used video card from folks who are
making room in their rigs for the new
wave of GPUs additionally I simply
couldn't find any good online
comparisons between the two models of
cards I'll be pitting against each other
today which are really neck-and-neck
when it comes to price and performance
think Batman vs Superman with the better
cast in the green corner we have the
EVGA GTX 970 for the win edition
featuring the brand's a CX 2.0 cooler
and measuring 9.5 inches long in the red
Kona is the nitro r9 390 from sapphire
sporting the heavyweights try X cooler
and weighing in at just over 12 inches
long making this the bigger clearance
bane of the 2 with its extra fan
standing back-to-back the r9 390
essentially packs double the memory
advantage over its opponent in terms of
both bus width and frame buffer but the
GTX 970 is definitely the more power
efficient contender boasting a lower TDP
and thus a lower wattage power supply
requirement it's no surprise then why
the red and green rivals are driven by a
pair of 8 pin and 6 pin PCI connectors
respectively not to mention the
difference in cooler size looks like an
ad for Viagra fortunately they don't do
this in the you
see but let's take a look at both
contenders back sides our nitro has
three DisplayPort 1.2 s1 HDMI 1.4 ay and
a single DVI for the win brings home one
DisplayPort 1.2 one HDMI 2.0 and two DVI
ports a small victory point here goes to
the GTX 970 for being able to drive 4k
at 60 Hertz over HDMI both cards feature
rock solid build quality with sapphires
larger enclosure and included backplate
adding some rigidity and heft over our
GTX 970 without spending too much time
on the coolers themselves each card has
its own unique assembly if heat sinks
heat pipes and fans to keep thermals in
check what matters more here is that
both of the GPUs maxed out at 74 degrees
Celsius in all of my load testing making
this an even more competitive matchup as
things begin to heat up as for acoustics
let's hear what these puppies sound like
under load
sweet Mary of Coyle wine as I'm sure you
guys could hear both cards have their
own special brand of coil wine with the
gtx970 s being notably louder with a
higher pitch the r9 390 certainly has
the louder fans of the two which
honestly I don't mind as much as the
shrieking cry of what sounds like robot
genocide on that note let's take the
gloves off and have a look at our
benchmarks which were run on my test bed
rocking to 59 60 X at 4,400 megahertz
with 16 gigs of DDR 4 on a gigabyte x99
gaming g1 Wi-Fi motherboard I'd like to
point out that both of these factory
overclocked cards were also manually
overclocked because overclocking here in
3dmark firestrike extreme we get our
first glimpse of where these cards stand
and the narrow lead of our GTX 970
indicates this should be a good fight
looking back I'd be curious to see if
the 390 would pull ahead and fire strike
Ultra given its larger frame buffer to
handle 4k but diving into our first game
of GTA 5 our Nvidia card scored higher
average frame rates at 1080 but the
tables begin to turn as we crank the
resolution minimum frame rates on the
other hand seem to be in favor of the r9
390 at 1080 and 4k with a stalemate at
quad HD again with hitman absolution the
GTX 970 leads at 1080 but falls behind
at Ultra HD most likely due to the r9
390 s higher memory and bandwidth I need
him to remind most of you that a portion
of the GTX 970 s frame buffer operates
at a much slower speed than typical
gddr5 which appears to be crippling the
cards performance at higher resolutions
in our testing interestingly the Nitro
scored the same results at 1080 as it
did at 1440 though I can't see this
being a CPU bottleneck with our
overclocked 59 60 X so I blame Paul he's
clearly sabotaging my videos Crysis 3
shows the r9 390 consistently topping
its competitor across the board save for
minimum frame rates at 1080 this is an
AMD back title after all notice again
how the nitro pulls ahead more and more
as we climb the resolution ladder and
stressed the memory on both carts I mean
so far these GPUs have been trading
blows left and right and my last test
with Metro last light does little to
rock the boat
despite rerunning the test several times
and double checking to make sure global
vsync was disabled both cards scored
remarkably similar min and average frame
rates at all resolutions so much for a
tiebreaker
apparently when it comes down to it both
cards are solid performers that excel in
different environments when gaming a
1080 the GTX 970 seems to be the faster
GPU whereas the r9 390 has an undeniable
edge at 4k where games become more
memory bound this is kind of a moot
point for team red though since a single
r9 390 isn't quite fast enough to drive
most triple-a titles at 4k comfortably
2560 by 1440 is where we find common
ground with both GPUs performing so
identically to the point where gameplay
experience between the two kind of
becomes indistinguishable this is
honestly such a close call but I'm
really forced to split hairs here but
assuming that both of these models stay
within 10 to 15 dollars of each other I
have to give the showdown crown two
sapphires nitro our 939 day while gamers
playing at 1080 might enjoy slightly
higher frame rates with the GTX 970 more
games are beginning to push the 4 gig
VRAM envelope and with the increasing
affordability of hyper tennety panels
double the GDR double the gddr5 for
around the same price simply makes the
r9 390 a more well-rounded option that
being said the GTX 970 for the win
Edition is arguably the faster card
clock for clock and Knox the nitro 390
on its ass when it comes to power
consumption efficiency efficiency and
clearance compatibility because it's all
small and stuff it can fit in more
places those are my thoughts after
today's testing guys but let me know
what you guys think of these results if
you would have come out with a different
verdict and why before you go don't
forget to toss me our big fat like on
