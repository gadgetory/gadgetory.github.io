just indicated in the last 10 seconds
this is a live stream that call and I do
every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time right here on twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware we also stream
the show in two halves on our respective
YouTube channels today we streams to
Paul's channel first which was
youtube.com slash Paul's hardware you
can check that out in the link that I've
put in my description below of my
youtube video and then now we're
screaming to my have I'm not you so it's
cool it's equals fair split 50/50 and
this is a fun
techno we'd like to have a few drinks so
feel free to drink along with us
whatever that beverage may be just make
sure you're drinking responsibly if it's
an adult beverage like this one and also
we can't usually use a build language
not like taxes or you know home loans
but but rather swear words that
inductive or deductive oh that you might
not be comfortable with so you have
little ones around if you have sensitive
hearing be aware please and apart from
that we have stores that we like to sell
things on my stores bit with tech not
slash store you can just go to bit way
tech now because the store is now the
home page as we've as I finally fallen
see with Paul and completely given up on
trying to update an actual website but
yeah there's a lot of stuff here hoodies
shirts mouse pads glasses mugs all the
stuff bottle openers a lot of these
things that we're using right now
actually the glasses have been selling
very well as usual also the shirts some
classic designs there you can also head
over to Paul woo beautiful and Paul's
Paul's hardware net is his store you can
find a lot of the same type of quality
materials with with Paul's own flair
added to them I like his oxblood
t-shirts with a thumb screw on it a lot
of good stuff there if you buy anything
from either of our stores will yell
Johnson at you if you buy something from
both of our stores simultaneously you'll
get a big old double Johnson at the end
of the show it will be glorious and I
look forward to a forever forever
appreciate
that every week that we yelled at you um
and another thing is that all the
donations for today's episode this
includes both Paul's half and my half
will be going straight to our good
friend in moderator cell processing
because it's his birthday so everyone
wish cell a very happy birthday because
L because he's awesome he does a lot for
our community and a lot for us here on
the channel so um on the stream so thank
you very much self have those donations
rolling it in the name of cell
processing and then I think that's
pretty much note I have a quick I have a
quick also donate also an announcement
sorry sure I today launched in 8800
thousand subscriber thank you giveaway
on my channel yep Paul's Arbor so if you
guys want to enter that go and do it
thank you it's open for two weeks I'm
giving away some cool stuff including in
GT X 1080 nice and yeah thanks thanks I
guess who subscribed pretty damn good
giveaway I think believe it Congrats on
800 K by the way you yeah that's awesome
I almost missed it and then and then I
didn't I like the title that you use for
a for your giveaway oh oh is it
something like poorly playing points for
aunty
alright so let's dive into the meat of
the show starting with our first segment
which is a new tech news starting with
let's see what's our first article here
I'm totally off the grid no Apple the
whole Apple debacle with their MacBook
Pro using Intel's new Cori 9 processor
the 8950 HK it's a 6 core CPU there were
thermal throttling issues that were
discovered initially by Dave Lee buddy
of ours fellow tech youtuber Dave 2d
Dave 2d does some great work on his
channel you guys check it out especially
if you like mobile and laptop stuff he
found that this MacBook Pro the new 2018
model with Cori 9 was actually thermal
throttling pretty significantly and the
CPU core frequency was actually dipping
well below the base clock frequency
under
a heavy load with Adobe Premiere Pro one
base clock below the base clock like
Maxim
that's it's one thing if you can't hit
the turbo but holy crap you can't even
hit the advertised base clock the bare
minimum which was advertised to be 2.9
gigahertz on on these quarters was only
showing 2.2 gigahertz in his testing
that's pretty darn significant when
you're considering all 6 cores and
potentially 12 threats um I think it's
and then this court sort of sparked a
whole blame game right there's all the
Intel slash and I feel like a lot of the
PC fanboys are also unintel side here
then there's the Apple fanboys who are
saying well you know if Intel had just
not kept delaying their 10 nanometer
CPUs then maybe they'd run cooler and we
wouldn't have this issue and then you
know Intel and PC side is like well you
know what Mac or Apple didn't have to
put these CPUs inside of their laptops
they're just they're so eager to get
this product out they could have
improved or re-engineered the thermal
the cooling solution to make the i-901
cooler they could have you know allowed
their their MacBook Pros to be just a
little bit so slightly thicker than they
usually are instead of trying to
preserve the the whole like sleek and
sexy chassis mentality but no they went
ahead with it anyway turns out that it
doesn't really matter a whole lot
because Apple came out today with a
statement saying that the whole issue
the whole thermal throttling has nothing
to do with Intel's CPU or has nothing to
do with the the MacBook Pro body but
rather a software bug this is just a
simple bug that can be instantly fixed
with a quick software update and sure
enough they've they've rolled out a fix
that's available immediately and this
should basically restore everything to
working order and you should be able to
hit all of those benchmarks and those
those performance numbers that are
advertised by Apple so holy crap
everyone was making a big stink
presumably over nothing this was just
announced today this is the and what's
interesting is that after this update
fix we're also seeing that this is a
this is a cure for for not just the
flagship eye 9 MacBook Pro
but even some of the other lower lower
tier models that don't even have quarry
nines in them which were thermal
throttling and now they aren't because
of this software match so I didn't have
too much opportunity to look into this
but I saw some comment that said it was
some it wasn't the actual CPU that was
thermal throttling it was a some
adjacent controller chip that was
actually doing it and that's why Apple
is able to actually solve this issue or
at least improve this issue okay I
didn't read that in the article but that
is with a software update does it seem
weird like a software update doesn't
seem like I should be able to solve just
something that's fundamental like if the
if the the chassis is designed and it's
too thin and it doesn't have you know
proper heat dissipation then then okay
but Dave actually posted a video 35
minutes ago did he really yeah
after the patch yeah so he has a piece
of post patch following video so
according to the article I have watched
according to the article that I'm
mentioning it says that the patch was
fine
to my knowledge he said the patch works
actually he pinned a comment saying the
patch works this is on his recent video
that he just posted the patch works it's
still not as good as the thick boys but
I'll take the performance bump so I
think what he means by thick boys is
some of the other manufacturers who also
incorporated or implemented I 9s into
their systems are running a bit faster
and maybe a bit cooler overall than the
MacBook Pro man I think that's what he
means thick meaning they're slightly
thicker right physically larger chassis
and so he's got some updated benchmark
performance numbers here which I suggest
you guys take a look at if you're at all
curious about this whole thing so I
guess the patch works it's probably not
100 percent of the potential of the core
9 core i9 that you might expect but at
least it seems like most of the heavy
issues have been weeded out with this
little fix here so that's good could
have been it could have been a real
cluster F but had it not been for I'd
have been more of a hardware based issue
my personal stance on something like
this would be if they're able to patch
it so it's not throttling down
- beneath its base clock what does that
mean that means it's only throttling
down now - just - just its base clock or
just slightly above its base lock like I
have to look at that I can do I can
appreciate some of the design aesthetics
of the MacBooks and everything but I
would much rather just have a slightly
thicker laptop even the slightly heavier
laptop that didn't throttle that had a
at a great cooling solution that wasn't
able to not to just run it at the baby
stock but maybe run it extensively at
some boosts clocks right because they
can actually whose frequency can go up a
decent amount right on these chips from
that's kind of what it sounds like
from from Dave's comment and stuff so
far is that there is still maybe a
smidge a smidgen of of thermal
throttling even though we're still now
able to get to the base clock but I
agree with Paul I'm you shouldn't settle
for the bare minimum especially when
you're paying top dollar for a product
like the MacBook Pro 15 inch this is our
flagship yeah notebook these I need
several several thousands of dollars at
their base model so the one that can be
up to like six thousand dollars plus yes
yes so you don't you don't pay six
thousand I don't care what product it is
you don't pay $6,000 for the bare
minimum performance for a laptop like
this if it has additional Headroom the
$6,000 in your pocket should allow you
to hit those an additional benchmarks
and those additional whatever thresholds
yeah so good work on you Dave yeah and
congratulations to all the success
you've had in the last year or two on
your channel it's doing fantastically by
the way awesome stuff dude Dave's a big
fan of awesome heartbreak well-deserved
oh yeah he watches us like every week
every every day even though we only do
one stream a week that's how dedicated
he is he's found a way to he breaks it
up into
vii just so he could watch a piece of it
every day
that's how much she loves us thanks Dave
thanks Dave for your patronage we
appreciate it
um all right moving on reddit user zou
Dame compiled this little list of a
bunch of be 450 motherboards from AMD
these are a.m. for boards compatible
with the second gen rising chips yeah
and there's a lot of them there sums
from Asus there's a one from gigabyte
couple from as Drock let's talk about
these these mostly seem available the
only one I didn't actually see pop up
was the Amazon link there's one Amazon
link out of all those new egg ones I was
just getting the dogs of Amazon again
I got flashbacks from from freaking
prime day you know triggered by pts you
can just buy this right now you can just
buy it apparently they seem they are
seemingly available right now yeah all
right it's Add to Cart
you should add it to cart and see no I
don't want your stupid yeah well let's
get one call pick up tomorrow yeah we
could we we have a be 450 board in here
within 24 hours as we live next to the
new egg roll call center um which is
super cool so you guys can buy B 450
boards now apparently from a new egg if
you're in the u.s. that's cool there's a
couple interesting ones here the price
range for all these boards is probably a
dozen or so boards listed from this
Reddit user and the prices range from
all the way down from $69 to about 129
so pretty decent range if you're looking
at a one of the highest end boards that
that's on this list there's the asus rog
Strix b 450f gaming which Paul will tell
Paul would definitely bring up it's it's
the prettiest board that's listed in my
opinion of course looks serious
objective but I think this one looks the
nicest just in terms of the RGB kind of
the nice nicer heat sinks I would also
has it has cyber text on the heatsink
cyber text cybertek's cyber text me
we were cyber texting each other it
sounds like online porn I'm having
sniper text with you
and then there's veeram heatsink looks a
little bit more substantial than some of
the cheaper models that are on this list
so that's nice maybe some additional
overclocking Headroom here it's a fixed
i/o shield yes integrated read on the
i/o cover it's really nice it's got RGB
lighting of course with you know some
RGB headers a couple uh couple RGB
headers there twos a couple I've got
twos as well and plenty of USB 3.1 to go
around they've got two Gen 2 ports that
are type-a and four USB 3.1 gen2 are
also type a free of I'm sorry three of
which were Type A and one is type C so
plenty connectivity there there's also
the gigabyte the only gigabyte board
that was listed towards the end here was
the B 450 horas Pro Wi-Fi rev 1.0 at 119
dollars so 10 bucks cheaper than the ROG
board you just looked at also has RGB
also has 2 m dot 2 slots it should be on
the reddit page probably at the very
bottom or as pro ATX oh so this one also
has plenty of USB 3.1 genuine and Gen 2
ports kind of has a high they did the
thing again 120 they did the thing again
where it's got some orange accents on
the heatsink they're sticking with the
orange to doubling down I'm thinking
maybe they're they're swappable or
something maybe it comes with extras in
the box or something that you can swap
them out for some more color orange LEDs
though - those might be RGB I'm not sure
if the audio tracing is is RGB but I
don't see RGB anywhere in this name here
though really no no there's oh you know
what
scroll down into the it's got a whole
spread of features
I did see RGB for sure wait does it say
right here whoa good ha
sputtering wants elevation stop
buffering that happen F lot of F's hella
F's we do not have Wi-Fi we are
connected directly via ethernet people
on YouTube let me double check limit
double check all right we've got some
technical technical difficulties here
which says zero dropped frames I don't
know what YouTube is doing YouTube is
live everyone refresh although if you
can't see the stream right now than
twitch please like it's okay on our end
yeah my scream is fine I don't know guys
I'm seeing I'm seeing the stream a
region I think maybe regional yeah I
would just say keep smashing it f5 until
something works we haven't changed
anything so obviously it's it's not us
but ok so then there's all there's also
one mini ITX board in this whole line up
the as rock fatality be 450 gaming ITX
AC which indicates that it does have
Wi-Fi in the AC variety there's one
about two slot and it's this is actually
one of the priciest boards on the list
129 what it says this is as much as the
ROG board Wow as the ROG Strix B 450f
gaming so which is a full ATX board full
feature so pretty pretty hefty premium
for the Mini ITX version so far I think
it's like because they think they're
gonna be the only ones with Mini ITX out
of the gate so I consult for more money
or something maybe out of the gate but
they're definitely enough to drop their
price when other boards come out cuz
it's a pretty basic looking board I mean
doesn't really have like beer I'm
heatsinks looks like it's got four pin
and RGB beep in RGB yeah I mean how many
three four six six MOSFETs right there
it's got a reinforced PCIe slot it's got
a reinforced PCIe slot oh yeah metal I
mean that definitely drives for Christ
and very very worthwhile feature okay
seven point went out of you and all that
so I'm sure it's a great board but 1:29
still kind of steep for a mini ATX p450
board Matt that looks like that okay be
450 yay options and you can buy them now
yeah aw yay all right moving on w CCF
Tech has written about Tesla running low
on cash now demanding retroactive price
cuts from their suppliers what what so
this is interesting
Wall Street has reacted quickly to all
this by the way and prices of Tesla
stock fell by 4% at market opening this
morning and I guess this you know I
guess we can start off by saying that
automakers like Tesla usually
incentivize their suppliers to give them
the best price as possible by offering
by by getting by meeting them at the
negotiation table and saying look we can
promise you really high demand we have
the ability as automakers since we're
selling hundreds of thousands of
vehicles nationwide or globally to buy
millions of units at a time from you all
right we can do this over several years
come on give us a really awesome rate
and so it's it's a really hard deal for
a lot of these suppliers to turn down
they can't say no to the automakers and
these contracts lock both parties in for
several years at a time but but as it's
as it turns out there was a memo to the
Wall Street Journal recently that
confirmed that Tesla is going back to
these suppliers years after they've
purchased some of these these parts and
asking them for price cuts on on these
historical purchases dating all the way
back to 2016 so it's like stuff that
they bought from a supplier like a
million nuts and bolts that they bought
in 2016 they're now going back and
saying hey could we get like a cash
rebate could you give us a discount on
the products we bought from you two
years ago and and it's it's something
that's virtually unheard of in the
automotive industry
Courtney this article is normal
specialists they're saying this is
absolutely ludicrous but then again
Tesla has never really been the company
to follow the rules right to color
inside the lines so it's really
interesting it also shows that Tesla's
kind of desperate right now for effort
for just straight cold hard cash um and
also that they care more about their
their you know their their cash flow
then perhaps their their own suppliers
because at this point when the supplier
is locked into a several year long
contract and they're you know and
they're they're basically giving the
lowest prices they can the lowest prices
possible to these automakers so they're
already making razor thin margins off of
the products they're selling and and now
Tesla's saying could you give us a
little bit more if they were to do that
if these suppliers were to actually
honor the request they could be hitting
a direct cash hit to their bottom line
that would put a lot of people maybe
their employees in jeopardy
so Tesla's pretty desperate right now on
the bright side their model three
production is finally hitting their five
their magical five thousand units a week
quota that Elon Musk was kind of like
promising and was really touting as a
crucial milestone for the company this
was he was saying this a year ago we're
gonna make 5,000 Model threes a week
it's gonna happen that's what we need to
be stable and to start making money
they're finally hitting that after like
a whole year promising they were falling
really short of that in recent months
but they're finally there the bad side
is that the company's burning through
cash rapidly like there's a giant gaping
hole in their pockets two hundred and
thirty million dollars worth of
convertible bonds are due in November
and a possible 920 million dollars in
convertibles almost a billion dollars
will become due in March of 2019 if the
price of Tesla stock doesn't reach three
hundred and fifty nine dollars and 87
cents it's very specific
according to the article Tesla is
currently consuming around a billion
dollars every quarter and they've
already cut nine percent of their
workforce indicating that they
struggling here trying to cut shave down
their own spending but Tesla's predicted
to be out of cash by the first quarter
of 2019 no confirmation as to whether or
not the suppliers response to the
automakers oddly bold request has been
favorable or not I would assume most
suppliers are gonna say you know fuck
off that's bullshit
but damn Tesla is in a tight spot I'm
hoping that seems like it
Elon Musk can somehow dig him out of
this hole I mean he is he is also the
founder of boring company so I figured
you know literally this makes sense but
um you know who knows who knows it also
makes me wonder what if Tesla just went
completely bankrupt didn't like lost all
their money had to close down shop but
what happened to all the Tesla owners
like would they still be would they
still receive support for their cars
would they still have dealerships to
take their cars into what happens when
and ten other super charging stations
right exactly all that shit what happens
to the car owner when the car
manufacturer dies I don't know it's
interesting and that's probably a B
however unlikely or way down the line I
don't know things to think about folks
things to think about let's move on
though this article from a hot and heavy
hardware no it's just hot
hard hard rare they be copying us if it
was called Hutton Hardware so maybe we
copied them by calling our second anyway
this is a about an evil made attack evil
made attacks created creating backdoors
with firmware installs under four
minutes this is actually kind of scary
somewhat there was a security firm that
recently posted a video you can play the
video if you want and skim through it or
whatever it's a video that demonstrates
how a potential hacker with physical
access to your device can install
malicious firmware onto it in under four
minutes flat Wow
now this is also why they call it the
evil made evil made attack is because
like let's say you're in a hotel or
something like that the only person who
would really have the ability to come
into your room while you're not there
would be a maid
and that's of course the perfect
opportunity to strike and install evil
backdoors and foul malware and shit like
that these people it's a technical
knowledge to be able to do this sort of
thing are definitely often work as hotel
maid's given what I understand yep
absolutely okay he's just like some like
obligatory shady dude it dressed up in a
maid's outfit like a Mariette
oh hello oh he's like clearly a Russian
hacker all right so this requires
removing the laptops backplate as you
can see here in order to access the
devices serial programmable interface or
SPI flash chip so you're accessing
basically the the flash trip where the
firmware is stored all right and then
once you've located where the firmware
is stored you can you can attach a
hardware programming device which is
used for flashing firmware and can be
purchased for a mere three hundred
dollars or less so very accessible easy
to obtain cheap this device that they
have attached meets which looks kind of
like a I don't know just looks like a
silver box I got an F con sticker on it
F con sticker on it um this thing loads
the back door onto your device and then
you're screwed
yeah so right now he's just waiting he'd
see the timer on the left there we're
approaching two minutes after about you
know three minutes or so he pops it off
and proceeds to replace the back plate
of the laptop and it's like wham bam
thank you ma'am
never even happened but all of a sudden
now they have access to files of your
computer and and they can track your
movements because it's essentially a
backdoor so I guess this the moral of
the story here folks is if you have
highly sensitive data or information on
your laptops or notebooks that you
should be aware of who has the pot the
potential to to compromise that and if
you are if you do find yourself in a
hotel where you think you know you know
scams like this happen or not super rare
or not super in common then maybe take
advantage of some of those hotel safes
that they have in those rooms there are
safes in lots of hotel rooms more maybe
you can request to save for something
from concierge techs
put it in where the maids don't have
access to the actual safe code or just
hide it just hide hide your laptop make
sure it's password-protected the article
suggests going into the BIOS and
disabling the the firmware debugging
ability but I feel like a hacker who
knows how to do this might also know how
to go into your BIOS and and just reset
that yeah so um yeah something to be
aware of this is really just you know
this isn't something that's necessarily
going around and is infecting millions
of users worldwide or anything but it's
just it was a security firm who wanted
us all to be aware that this is a
possibility the more you know physical
access is often a huge security
vulnerability with computers indeed
they're very little hands on next up we
have a leak from overclocked 3d net
maybe not directly from them but it's
about a leak for the GTX eleventh series
release dates whoo yeah even get some
juicy details some juicy rumor leaks on
on when these cards are gonna be
available to the market and this is
actually from gamer meld originally
whose is a tech youtuber who I'm not
familiar with
it's a 1080 plus we'll get there so
gamer meld a tech youtuber leaked in and
leaked an email which whose the validity
of this email has not been verified so
bear that a might this is all rumor mill
that contains the release dates of the
gtx 1180 i'm most of tennety the 1180
gtx 1180 is presumably going to be
launched on august 30th the gtx 1170 is
presumably going to launch on September
30th a month later and the GTX 1160
would be a month after that on October
30th so month after month after month
from starting from August we'll see 1180
1170 and 1160 the email mentions the gtx
1180 plus as Paul mentioned but this is
likely just referring to Adam board
partner variants so cards that you know
companies like issues MSI gigabyte have
taken the reference model taken the
cooler off and added their own Flair
maybe tweeting some of the other makes
sense elements so so yeah this this does
these dates however sketchy the email or
leaked might
be in the release date does make sense
to a degree when you think about
previous release cycles from Nvidia and
how they release their graphics cards
they usually start with the with the the
80 the xx8 0 first and then they'll
release the the lower tier ones like the
70 xx 70 skew and the xx 60 skew and
then later on they'll release the 8 0 TI
or whatever they want to call their
premium flagship kart geforce card so we
Paul and I cannot confirm or deny any of
the rumors here we're just giving you
this information as as rumors as rumors
come about and I'm sure all of this will
be confirmed or denied for you either by
us or not in the near future so quick
note to anyone in chat who's talking
about stream lag or anything like that I
just double checked and we have zero
dropped frames zero
it must be YouTube anything you guys are
seeing as either a regional outage or
YouTube or something like that yeah
try try streaming at a lower resolution
or watch us on Twitch if you really have
to twitch seems to be fine twitch is
just having a dandy old time yep all
right thus concludes tech news we can
move on to ask the audience
yay segment where Paul and I ask you the
audience about this there's one more
article before we go on to ask the
audience I do not see that one thank you
Paul
overclocked 3d net once again this is
about Samsung launching their micro LED
TVs next year Liu Bowl so micro LED is a
technology that improves upon quantum
dot or QED LED and OLED panels that LG
is is very very famous for while it
while eliminating the disadvantages that
come with both
it was an internal recovery burp oh good
alright so the disadvantage of queue led
is is the latency for example not the
latency the per pixel luminance in cue
LED panels so they have to be you know
backlit and stuff like that which
definitely contributes to a lot of
backlight bleed hot spots and things
like that and then there's also the
disadvantages of OLED panels such as
latency and color burnin which is
terrible terrible terrible things to
have apparently micro LED Samsung's new
micro LED is gonna solve both these
issues and it'll just be one singular
technology that will rule the TV world
apparently in CES 2018 earlier this year
Samsung revealed their 146 inch TV using
micro LED technology that they deemed
the wall the wall are they they dubbed
the wall and it's certainly a wall
because it's it kind of looks like the
wall it's very very thin it was 80
millimeters at the time eighty
millimeters thick very thin the display
size thanks to the modularity of micro
LED technology allows the screen sizes
to be scaled almost endlessly which is
how they were able to get it to 146
inches so easily they do have plans to
release the 146 inch and these 73 inch
models next year and 2018 you could have
the wall on your wall pretty compelling
that's like almost like they wanted to
be a consumer product almost almost
because these ones definitely are not
73 inch and a hundred and forty six inch
micro LED TVs are not going to be cheap
these will be some of the most expensive
TVs on the market ever like $1000
there's like Oh LEDs five years ago was
just like who the fuck had $20,000 to
blow on an LG OLED 70 inch screen $2,000
20,000 20,000 dollars yeah I mean TV
technology does not come cheap when
you're a very very very early adopter
and this is gonna be no difference so
the other thing is that when they
released next year these TVs will be 30
millimeters thick that's 50 millimeters
thinner than they were just at this
year's CES so the technology is already
advancing so quickly the three ethos
skillet down three centimeters three
centimeters think that is that thick
yeah that's it's really thick been
really thin at the thickest point right
I want to say like at the thickest point
why don't people say that shit is thin
it's thinner than you know like with two
ends like thin thin thin so then th I n
n let me see that we send them thins and
check you'll know to me so apart from
modularity M micro LEDs can offer
incredible brightness levels an
extremely wide color gamut and extreme
levels of contrast with the technology
being self emitting it's a self emitting
technology means you don't need a
backlight system you don't need
backlighting it has per pixel
illumination that a Q LED lacks for the
C thin it works perfectly fine and Chet
I'm liking it then thin thin what let's
see more thin I can see that catching on
then so then yes let's make this catch
on just like we made you know calling
Steve from gamers Nexus Tech Jesus thin
a thin sheet has been bro um all right
there's uh so yeah you don't need any
backlighting that's awesome you don't
need any color filtering Samsung claims
is gonna be the next standard for future
screen technology there's also no burn
in with with oli LEDs which is
interesting because without any burnin
we can potentially see micro LED make
its way to PC gaming monitors or PC
monitors in general computer monitors
because correct me if I'm wrong but
there really aren't any OLED PC monitors
because the burnin would be so severe
from from having just like you know a
static screen or a static image like
your your desktop wallpaper or you know
being you know on a webpage for more
than 10 seconds at a time
whereas with like it you know a TV like
mu movie or TV show the image is
constantly changing
doesn't really burn in quite as easily
so that might be kind of cool having a
micro LED being brought to the PC gaming
market who knows that's all I got for
now though only coming to luxury
displays sounds exciting could be years
before the the micro LED technology hits
the general consumer market because the
73-inch 146 inch models are again going
to be the luxury for the luxury audience
seems like in the past when there's been
a new display technology that comes out
though like you'll always see it in TVs
first and often for a long time before
you actually see it and yeah monitors
right which sucks it does we get the you
know like that like 4k scraps 4k TVs at
home that you'd use at home have been
pretty standard for the past couple
years but we're still only just seeing
4k I think like 4k HDR is only starting
to be a thing with the PC monitors so
yeah yeah if this is effective for a PC
monitor for gaming in particular I hope
it transitions more quickly yeah and
other Tech's have in the past I agree
all right now we can move on to ask the
audience now we're ready for it Paul and
I will ask you guys a series of three
questions you guys answer as honestly as
possible please that's what makes it fun
and then Paul and I will guess what you
answer and we'll decide we don't house
or no house the other weird well I guess
you could just fill it up with some
other 2017 predictions
I predict 26 god bless you David jeez
Oh painful it did hurt a lot why did oh
why do sneezes hurt me no I don't know
I'm messed up oh I'm totally messed up
all right first question do you get all
of your video consumption exclusively
from the internet
and this is instead of showing your
question I'm just gonna keep doing it
just keep cycling through into bold
lower thirds if you haven't used it
along that won't confuse anyone joining
the street whoa videos that are good
yeah pip-boy house a classic all right
you should bring that one back I don't
know why that segment never took off we
have guests the audience let's do all
right guess the audience is the closest
we have to ask the audience so anyway
okay I think so
thank you very much cell for posting
that link in chat so the question was do
you get all of your video consumption
exclusively from the internet meaning do
you rely do you have cable on the cable
cutter do you rely on cable TV still to
watch your show there's a movie the
stuff like that or are you relying 100%
on the internet for this and I phrase it
this way kind of seemingly complicated
because some of you might be living with
your parents or other people who have a
cable subscription that you don't use at
all it's just for them it might just be
your parents you watch cable but you
don't watch any of it so that's why it's
worded kind of weirdly so yeah well you
guys answer that as honestly as you can
Paul and I are gonna go ahead and
deliver the second question to give you
guys some some time to answer that one
before we argue the first one which is
the second question what would be
weirder weirder you put this one up on
screen that does it that's just an empty
straw poll oh shit what did you do why
didn't it work oh no all right okay you
you argue all right you you answer your
first thing go go to the first question
what's your favorite color
No hey this one I don't know why that
link didn't work I don't I don't either
just make your argument for the first
question really quick it's look at the
third question okay fine
third question is what is your favorite
color we have black even though black is
really just the absence of color weight
even though white actually contains all
wavelengths or lots of other colors
I like that you have a teal in there
specifically this seems like a popular
off-color no what do you do that why are
you doing that what are the answers even
gonna look like that why not
I like poop poop bad boop boop the
indifference of poop
these are the heavy hitters these are
the heavy hitters that we have to ask
folks all right I wouldn't vote on that
one it's very important that we get that
answered okay okay
sorry that's a little tension the first
question is serious shit are you sure we
yet should we give them the second
question that is now ready it's really
not about ready now yes okay okay so the
question here is what would be weirder a
clean-shaven Kyle or a soul patch Les
Paul ah I feel like this is questions we
need to need to answer okay that's good
this is a good question to ask you can
tell I had plenty of time to prepare for
the show and it was super on top of
things all right so while you guys are
answering all that let's let's answer
the let's guess on the first question
important we get your feedback on this
stuff guys I know don't shirk this
opportunity
don't jerk it to have an influence on
the future of all humanity what Paul
said trying to be positive trying to be
a light in this world positive influence
all right okay so do you all right
so all right what percentage of people
do you think only consume video from the
internet Paul what percentage this is
yes or no okay and
for our audience I'm gonna say 58% yes
58 yeah da % get all of their video
exclusively from the internet 58% okay
I'm gonna say you're wrong I think
you're too low our audience is very care
what you think they're very they're very
new age they're they're up and current
right they're irrelevant
okay so 59% I was gonna say being
strategic really going off on a limb no
I think that would be a little cheap
because I've done that in the past and
I'll probably do it again today but I
think for this one I'm gonna go with I
donno if 69 percent just seems right 69
percent for no reason in particular
I chose 58 percent Cal chose 69 percent
which means that if it is sixty four
point five no six
I can't math right now what is it 69-58
what's five point five know what 69 plus
and be sixty if it's 63 if it's sixty
three point five percent that we tie 60
what three point five 63.5% would be a
tie okay
and the results it's all I got
oh wow whoa I was way closer than you
well above Cal you win holy moly almost
to 3/4 3/4 I know I know you've got the
sixty three point five on one point I
did but you don't know your basic
fractions so almost eight fifths of you
guys get all of your video consumption
exclusively from the internet that isn't
good to know
lots of cord cutters out there yeah I'm
impressed damn screw that screw the
screw big cable right who who wants to
pay for your cable you just you're just
putting money in ajit PI's pockets
exactly he's to be not directly but in
some roundabout way okay next question
what would be weirder clean-shaven Kyle
or
soul patch soul patch Les Paul I don't
think I don't think I've ever seen you
without a soul patch in person you've
had one ever since I've met you and it's
never gone away ever since I've met you
since the day I met you in 2011 and I
met you without having any of this for
the first couple years I was
clean-shaven but then at some point
maybe in 2013 or something I just
started growing it out and I don't think
I've I think there might be once or
twice since then that I've actually
shaded it all off I know for a fact that
for the YouTuber impersonations or the
youtuber impressions video I did shave
it all I think to do your your yours and
like you know Austin's impersonation and
a couple other people but since then I
really haven't really I'm touched it so
either way it's gonna be weird whatever
either either of these is gonna be a
weird option but which one did you guys
think would be weirder and again I guess
we'll go with another percentage here so
I'll just go with my percentage being
you know I think I have a feeling
they're gonna find your your lack of a
soul patch weirder for some reason
because it's just so like it's like
mine's just normal it's everyday but I
feel like your soul patch is more like
iconic like like if I was doing charades
no not charades if I was playing
pictionary and the word that I had to
draw for my team was Paul I would
literally just draw a soul patch and
they'd probably guess Paul I just draw
like three lines and they'd be like Paul
because that's how that's how married
you are to that image so I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say 69% once again since it
didn't fail me the last time 69% to
people
prefer a clean shape would think that a
soul patches Paul would be the weirder
of the two
okay what say you
Oh 68% I mean just I'm just trying to
play the odds I don't have it I don't
have some crazy explanation like you I'm
just you're right you know because
you're you're wrong Matt let's see what
people say you know you know I'm gonna
dominate you right now I actually you
what you would look way weirder without
your beard er hey then I've met my match
I win with you and your soul patch
everyone were one to one yep okay all
right
fair enough well now I know that this
has some value you know now I can like
dangle it like a carrot over your heads
hey guys give me all your money if you
want to see me clean-shaven I'll figure
out some way to exploit that a lot of
people are interested all right what's
your favorite cuddly uh usually it's
blue no yellow but I'm gonna choose
shoes blue just cuz that's blue okay all
right yeah we'll just go based off of
screen colors we have to do percentages
I'm gonna do you I'm gonna eliminate
some other stupid color I think that's
it's not fair for either of us to pick
so I'm gonna go with the gold black
black yeah I see a lot of people wearing
black see a lot of people think we I saw
a lot of black shirts I have all my
shirts
true I said black the most popular shirt
color even though I mostly only sell
black shirts maybe that skews the
results a bit but I'm struggling with
lab using real world's information here
yeah because I'm a scientist
all right results blue oh well done
well played Paul looks like I win asked
the audience with the score of two to
one you know you depends the Kyle I have
to drink
has to drink
one more one final bonus question why
poop
I like poop poop bed or poop okay
I like poop okay I'm gonna go poop okay
okay okay all right
OOP okay damn it ha ha God you are so
good with your poop ha all you say did
you know our audience so well ok just
make sense eh I guess you're right why
would you poop every day okay yeah yeah
it's not bad but it couldn't be bad
which is why it's okay I'm like
sometimes you shouldn't they shouldn't
like poop that's kind of weird yeah like
I like to poop and sometimes it can be
very satisfying although sometimes it's
not so I guess you're right you know I
kind of agree with the poop okay team I
agree - yeah I didn't think about my I
should have I should have treated this
like the serious question it is I think
that's that's what this boils down to it
I just wrote it off as some stupid
ignoring this question the two morons
would ask it's very important that we
ask the audience these important
questions right for under estimating
your genius our genius just goes it is
alright alright that's it
that's that's it donations we can do
some donations now that's pretty much
you're gonna do it for my half the show
okay so let's rattle off some of the
leftover donations from Paul's half
again all these donations are going to
sell for his birthday mr. Todd is the
gamer $9.99 Billy my first PC what are
your thoughts on a MSI Z 370 m5 16 gigs
of DDR for an attendee 1080i Z 370 m5 16
gigs in the 1080i sounds like a
reasonable combination if you're getting
a Z through 70 motherboard I would
assume you're getting like an 80 600 K
or 80 700 K to go along with it that's a
good combo yeah
it'll last you many years yep ray are we
each solution revolution revolution 5
euros hey guys we hope to meet you next
year at CES and at Computex it'd be
great to hang out with you in Taipei or
small colleagues from Italy
that's cool like small as in your your
stature are you physically small I mean
we're done be my Curie I'm pretty small
so I I'd probably could fit in Kyle's
only about five six yeah five six and a
half I have six and a half I have to I
have to give you it may be pushing five
seven I have to give the point five just
cuz so just make sure you get our
attention otherwise if you might not see
you that's true depending how small you
actually are sit on each other's
shoulders that usually helps but that'd
be cool to say yes we're gonna be at CES
we will Wow to say that like that's
coming up we're still in the long like
it's a PR there's a longer gap between
computation and CES than there is
between CES and competence yeah yeah
it's okay
still got many months crazy Jarrod
Gibson $4.99 what is the smallest ITX
case that can fit a two eighty
millimeter GPU GPU 280 millimeter GPU I
was expecting a oh um is that geez I
heard that's I don't I wouldn't know the
answer to that off the top of my head I
don't know either how many inches is
that and so she said there's a lot of
cases mini ATX cases that can fit pretty
substantially sized GPUs when it comes
to length it's 11 inches 11 inches so on
the longer side but not the longest
that's what she said
I would think a lot of them can yeah um
fit ten and a half at least ten and a
half inch I think is excuse me a little
bit more standard size right cuz I think
that's what you're in video founders
Edition card lengths are you might want
to check like the the end case m1 that's
a really compact case that has full
full-length graphics card support with
fractal so it's the model for the tall
tall skinny fractal one oh no - OH -
yeah no - a - no - - I don't know if it
goes up to that length but I know that
the the the GPU chamber in there is
pretty substantial right so this it's a
kind of a specific question so it's hard
it's hard to immediately know you can
also check out the the silverstone s g05
oh yeah which is kind of a cubish type
of case but it supports an SFX power
supply which definitely whittles down
the size that can support some pretty
lengthy graphics cards veto subject you
said the Coolermaster elite 130 very
similar to rescue zero final very
similar except I think that one has a
full ATX power supply is slightly bigger
yeah but that's a good option too okay
all right there's some food for thought
thank you for the question Jason
Christophe $9.99 happy birthday sell
again
Kyle pin my PC do you guys like black
and blue Guinness and blue moon yes
what's black and blue Guinness I like
blue moon I've not had black and blue
Guinness I'm not sure I'm not a huge
blue blue moon fan Guinness is okay I
will drink Guinness and be happy with it
blue moon not so much it's too we T not
Hugh Shannon of the we D beers anything
that goes well in orange just picky
sober squid okay 500 yen hey you've got
a Japanese local perhaps I'm sure you
exchanged your Japanese yen during your
last visits of Japan I hope this is
enough to go buy some Asahi zero or
Kirin all free lol yes are those
alcohol-free versions of Asahi and
Kieran that's what it sounds like
yeah it does sound that way set is that
a thing I yeah it definitely is Japan
was very big on there alcohol-free beer
I saw a lot of lands I saw a lot of beer
that just said like well cuz I bought a
lot of beer in Japan and like every
convenience dry wedding - there was like
at least one or two brands of beer that
just said no alcohol but it was like
right there with all the other beer and
said
yeah I'm sure some of it was from Asahi
instead I've never I didn't I didn't
drink anything because it just seemed
like less less fun seemed worth my money
but now that we have 500 yen hell yeah
and don't give it a shot there you go
thank you super squid Andrews rare it
also explains why he's a sober squid
that's true alright I'm sorry five
Canadian dollars from Andrew thank you
Andrew
two beers for sell or a six-pack just
enjoy them beers and Cheers
here's Jesus cheers to you Andrew you
nice and kind canadian muchly for your
donation Femi ciao ciao
but the $5 i never win the giveaway but
I entered yours Paul oh thank you
congratulation man also beginning to
save for the air TX next year I really
hope you two get invited actually Phoebe
we were invited this year we were but we
just had so much going on you know we
don't we you don't even want to go to
that we were like that we think it's
gonna be stupid yes dumb - stupid he
sucks I think they're dumb okay -
platformer anything no I just did it we
were invited this year it didn't work
out to go but yeah it sounded like Jay
had a great time and it's definitely
something we would be interested in in
joining in the future so you from gamers
Nexus went there is that oh yeah Steve
gave you sex sounds like he had a good
time to you so maybe we'll go next year
yeah and maybe I'll play something in
the case toss or something like that
Mark Anderson 5 Australia's Cheers
sell happy birthday a lot of love for
the cell thanks mark
whoo wait you passed grandmother Graham
Ninh 20 bucks
have you heard they sell once again
still get a lot of attention today on
his birthday which was yesterday
drinking a delicious drink out of my
shiny new thumbscrew pub glass while I'm
watching whoo glorious also looking to
build my first system sometime soon
using what I've learned from watching
you guys oh well then God help you best
of luck to you grandma if you're using
us as a primary source make sure you you
know keep a drink handy forget first
time around make sure you just don't
take things too seriously make sure your
hands are too wet while you're building
your first PC
thank you very much Jim
it's appreciated Michael Sechrist see
Christ geez I keep thinking Seacrest
like Brian sees Mike Seacrest
no Michael Seacrest $10 have you had
anything from great links brewing
platform or Market Garden Cleveland Ohio
or hopping frog Akron Ohio I'm sure I've
had at least one or two beers from one
or two of those breweries that you've
mentioned but I can't quite pinpoint it
so hopping frog sounds familiar for some
reason Great Lakes Brewing sounds
familiar to me yeah I'm sure I have I've
had a lot of different beers but I can't
really place any of them right now so if
your intention was to send us any of
that then we will definitely drink it
and we'll try it yep thank you Mike I
think Graham Ninh once again $10 also
what is the decent monitor around 27
inches that has pretty good specs and
performance and doesn't break the bank I
would get a 2560 by 1440 display at 27
inches I think that's the perfect
resolution for that screen size I would
also look into either freesync or g-sync
if you have depending on if they're
heading on the graphics card g-sync if
you can afford it because that's going
to be significantly more expensive
usually than a free sync panel look for
look for high refresh rate if you have a
graphics card that is capable of
delivering higher refresh rates in games
in most games that you play and it's
really hard to say without knowing your
budget these monitors can range anywhere
from 100 or so bucks all the way up to
the thousands yeah
it's really tough but a good 27-inch
1440p monitor I think you can get a
pretty good with like for like under 300
the RG Swift is a good option the AOC s
are good too on the Acer make some
really good ones yeah alright some BenQ
yeah again a lot of information but good
luck $5.00 from Franklin Robbins heavy
birthday cell based on a comment from
the last half you guys should start a
new segment homebrew review try and
review homebrew from viewers oh that's
kind of cool
it's kind of like a like an extension of
mail time a little bit yeah
we need to get a few home brews and to
be able to compare them to each other or
something without poison hopefully with
no poison in any of them as well I would
really add to the segment I think that's
a feature Zeon nuke once again $5 I'm
from Trinidad thank you for clarifying
no offense taken that's usually the
general response we get
we have fiber optic internet here Kyle
this is the 21st century oh well well
you showed me
I've got fiber mr. Zeon you got fiber -
I'm still on that crappy non fiber
copper yeah
copper which is still really fast we
have fast speeds mb6 is evident on
ticular 35 bucks
$35 some bday money for you sell Kyle
since you guilt shamed me I hope that
you had a good time at Comic Con as well
that's right
guilt shaming is always effective that's
why I do it it to everyone I see I tried
to attend the Meetup but I needed a
comic-con badge and those sold out
immediately yes they did yes I kind of
fell on our laps this year for the first
time in ever so that's why we jumped on
them because we're we know how hard they
are to get so sorry we missed EMB but
I'm sure there'll be another opportunity
there always is maybe maybe twitchcon
will be in San Diego again or I don't
know probably will we'll see next time
we should do a meet-up outside of the
con maybe that'd be cool to be
reasonable
do all meetups data q10 Australia's
happy birthday cell have 10 bucks from
Australia PS Lyle for president that
would be a terrible idea
buyout for president but there have been
worse options AJ Auditore wanted bucks
hey Kyle and Paul been watching your
guys work for a couple months now and
love every beta Thank You AJ will there
be any ITX bills coming up been trying
to find a nice small 4k build thanks a
lot keep being awesome I don't have any
planned well I do but it's it's gonna
have to wait until the case
I ordered a Dan case a four ov3 so the
newest one that should be shipping
starting tomorrow
actually nice so I'll be doing a
building that probably gonna be rising
second Chen and maybe two gtx 1180 if
those are out by the time I get around
in that project be Bergin sweet I have
nothing planned as specifically as Kyle
but I'm sure I'll do another mini ITX
build at some point in the future but
I'll try to let you know when that's
coming Thank You AJ thanks man
dude $20.00 thanks for the Tesla segment
to have a job interview there tomorrow
and now I'm worried about job longevity
oh no sorry Tim oh and happy birthday
sell and double if this went through
twice since the first one froze
Tim it doesn't look like that's the case
so your 20 bucks your other 20 bucks are
safe yeah thanks for your $20
darn it and thank you for your donation
oh yes best of luck with the Tesla job
interview I think we should cut off
donations so they realize they're still
a page and a half there is guys stop
donating all right I mean we love
selling but we're gonna end the show too
so no more donations please yeah we're
gonna try to get through the rest of
your generosity is inconveniencing us I
know like open 10 dollars my PC is a CPU
resin 1,300 X with an MSI xc70 King X
370 gaming m7 32 gigs in ddr4 msi 10
780ti 8 gigabyte to sli running with a
960 Evo m2 SSD no vsync will upgrade my
CPU to get me a hundred an FPS and away
from 60fps absolutely your CPU is
holding you back ya figure ation big
time upgrade what a weird I'm afraid
upgrade that CPU what a weird config
because he's also he he has an ex 370
board that's fairly high end and m7
that's it's strange that he would have
gotten that combination of hardware to
get started but you know you've got a
really nice platform apart from the CPU
and there's plenty of CPU upgrades so
you're not in a bad situation
just look at 2700 X's 1700s 1700 X 1818
800 X like any of the any of the core
options rise in first gen arise in
second
Jen an upgrade to that yeah whichever
one you can get cheap I agree cool
Tobin $10 again my PC is a CPU res oh
wait no that's the same oh he duplicated
it okay Kerry Kerry Petersen $5 Billy my
first water-cooled loop soon can you
mount a res on its side build will be in
a Corsair 280x thoughts happy birthday
sell sweet cut Kyle I'm thinking means
my haircut thank you very much you can
match a res on its side yeah I'm your
matching reservoir is the main thing you
want to consider is how you might bleed
it in the future which can sometimes be
inconvenient depending on how difficult
it is to lift and rotate your case true
beyond that the main thing you want to
be made making sure of is that your
reservoir is above your pump because
pumps typically are not ever supposed to
run dry reservoir needs to be physically
above the pumps so you can fill the
reservoir and it will fill the pump and
then you can turn the pump on and cycle
loop liquid through the loop without
without the pump the reservoir emptying
and your pump running dry cold
that's the main things thing you need to
consider okay Aaron Baker $5 I built me
and over-the-air antenna for the roof
connector connect it to Plex so I could
still watch CBS and not to pay for it
and drop cable nice that works I need to
update my Plex past subscription my rant
never messed with Plex yeah I'm a man
I'm pretty happy with my media setup
right now
but Duncan Morris 5 Australia's you
asked earlier why someone called you
floppy Kyle you literally have a floppy
disk on the t-shirt you're wearing no
there you go that is very true and if
you guys couldn't tell it says I was the
shit underneath it funny it's a good
shirt it's good shirt I enjoy it
available on enjoy wearing it but no
it's not make sure uh incorrect false
information Aaron no Duncan no fee DK
beefy Dyke
no well beef will be p DK yeah you're
right sorry $20 my new PC I 979 ATX e RG
rampage 6 extreme
Corsair RGB pro 64 gig kit of RAM 780ti
SLI by - it's welcome to a court of
Corsair Paris apply the Corsair 1000d
case samsung m2 if I'm at a gig Samsung
Evo pearl one terabyte WD black x2
coarser ll1 2021 Corsa coarser ll1 20s I
don't know what a comp roast x3 is
Thermaltake temp sensor by two little
beefy DK that either sounds like a like
extreme users wishlist or if you're
actually building that computer you have
room for an entire other computer in
there in the 1000 days Oh what are you
doing with the Mini ITX build what I
would ask you know let that space go to
waste
can you can you remove that is there's
zero there's zero points in getting the
Corsair 1000d unless you're planning and
using both putting two systems in it
other than that there's so many more
practical cases that are smaller can you
put more radios in place of that mini
ITX area no that's really okay like it's
where where it is it's like there's no
there's nothing else that would go there
right because that's you can you can
it's modular for the elite for the
fantex up to elite you can remove the
mini ITX mounting so and put in
radiators and fans and shit like that if
you wanted to so I was just wondering if
the 1000d was similar or if it's no I
mean the the the mount for that lower
system is part of the shroud right for
the main power supply right so yeah I
mean there's nothing vineya you would
want to know other practical use of that
space other than putting a computer
there sure and there's no reasonable
reason to buy that case unless you're
planning on putting two systems in it
because it's so large and cumbersome and
write heavy and everything
but they'll be vdk if that's really what
you're buying and what you're putting in
there then I wish you the best of luck
with your build and that's gonna be
pretty epic word alone $5 for Halloween
this year polish dress up as Fred Durst
from Limp Bizkit know that and baggy
pants the lure through that Oh
would you do it would you do it Oh would
you do it would you be friends for
Halloween oh my god you could totally do
it
no because Fred Durst is like he's got
the soul patch though he's a white dude
with a soul patch and the last time just
for a backwards hat Durst was relevance
that exactly and I've never worn a
backwards hat and got any extended
period of time and especially not a MLB
one dude that it would be hilarious
because that was like also your your
child not your childhood but our
generation was limp Biskit and should
know when they were right take offense
to the fact that you were identifying
any ones like generation with Limp
Bizkit I'm just saying they were more
relevant then than they are now no limp
Biskit was like a mediocre like like ban
I'm not like I'm not saying they were a
success of other people's songs I'm not
saying they were any really never
extremely a mesh and like sort of
filling a void at the time they were
niche but everyone knew who they were
it was vapid and horrible and like
Tooley two years later they were a joke
and you just happened to look exactly
like their lead singer but without a hat
he looks like me okay I can't help that
Oh does he does he know when were you
born
what year he's 47 he was born old you
look like Fred dersu he's almost 5000
asshole
stupid you copied Fred Durst look at how
old he looks he looks like dust he looks
like that's you and Ted is a soul patch
anymore it's got a full beard I know you
would be you would be relevant Fred
Durst you'd be oh gee semi relevant Fred
Durst and then when people ask you hey
Paul what are you for Halloween you
could say irrelevant see you could you
could you could dress as Fred Durst
ironically in honor of you hating him
and advertise how much of a loser he is
it's like a hate costume if I dressed up
like Fred Durst and went to like a
Halloween party like 90% of the people
wouldn't know who I was because the
people there would be younger why would
you be at that party in the first place
then because like a bunch of college
kids and you older you don't go to
Halloween parties anymore so I'm
assuming you'd have to go a younger
crowd but that would meet out that would
weed out all the shitty young
Millennials and just like you know some
like people your age five dollars well
spent wishbone yang Minh Choi hey yang
my old high school pal $25 says computer
oh yeah he's a friend of yours yes yes
he's doing it on the show before
yeah thank you Game one we appreciate
your computer donation I hope I hope
that was intentional and you didn't like
accidentally have a heart attack to fall
on your keyboard and type the word the
letter O ten times because that happens
but then but then his face his face
would have had to like also roll on the
perfect parts of his keyboard to finish
the word computer it'd be like the most
graceful accident to ever come from a
heart attack I don't know what I'm
talking about right now I don't either
thank you young moon I'm very very very
grateful Jonathan s Jonathan s do you
think the third gen rising compared to
the 1600 X will have significantly
higher clock speeds it's really too
early to say John yeah we we have not
even caught wind of a third gen rising
from we don't know yields of resources
performance is gonna be like we know
what frequencies are gonna be like I
hope I would say mean that'd be nice
it's probably gonna have higher clock
speeds than second gen rise and I would
assume definitely none over the 1600 X
not only are we in a core warm where
Intel and AMD are trying to fight for
who has the most cores but it's also a
bit of a clock speed war and I feel like
AMD that's one area that they probably
look at and go
yeah Intel's kind of crushing us in that
department so I feel like with every
passing generation they're trying to up
the maximum clock speed that their chips
are capable of in order to stay
competitive in that realm with Intel so
I would assume I don't know anything but
I would assume that you'll see higher
clock speeds on the newer generation
resin chips then you are now assumption
reasonable assumption assumption Guido
Sarducci $5 doesn't ruin my build and I
am definitely getting rid of my master
casemaker Pro six no filters Oh
suggestions full ATX Taichi x3 70 really
the myth the master cheesemaker pro six
doesn't have filters that's the same in
case we built for a cell is it I thought
it had dust filter why wouldn't it have
dust filters I don't know yeah this is
the same one we built it sells computer
in that's so bizarre I thought I did
it's been a while so yeah that's what I
was thinking I see filters whatever I
did it so I don't know man I think I
think Jonathan you need to earn oh sorry
Guido
maybe you got ripped bro did you buy our
case used cuz it should have dust
filters at least at the front the intake
interesting he said they screwed me then
in chat yeah if you bought it from some
in that case not just you'll hold out
for the end to end to fantex in 2x
evolve X they evolved X that's the
coolest case that case and would be a
worthy upgrade the case is the bee's
knees
