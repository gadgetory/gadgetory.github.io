yeah here it is man I hope you like it
Oh welcome back to pimp my Reg everybody
this is episode six today we're taking a
look at a build from a man know a boy
named Sebastian Sebastian is a student
in high school he didn't tell me that he
went to high school but I'm assuming
that he is in high school because he
looks like he is sorry if that's wrong
Sebastian but he needs a lot of help
here this this is a system in dire need
of some assistance because it it's just
look at it let's first talk about some
of the specs here because at its core
this is a fairly well put-together
system and spec wise we've got a 9600 k
so a core i5 from intel that's a six
core cpu however there's there some
complications here we actually have a B
360 motherboard from MSI I believe so we
can't actually overclock our 9600 K
which is a damn shame plus we have this
hyper 212 cooler from Coolermaster which
is not a bad cooler for all intents and
purposes it is a really good budget
option but even if we did have say a z3
90 board that allowed us to overclock we
wouldn't get very far with a entry-level
cooler such as this one we have a 16 gig
kit of Corsair Vengeance LTX ddr4 and I
believe 3200 speed let me try to look in
there ah man tried to kill me you guys
see that 3000 megahertz its Intel we're
fine we also have a very nice gigabytes
a dual fan GTX
1070 TI which is also a very capable
piece of hardware and it pairs nicely
with the 9600 K even if you're not
overclocking it the fans are just
spinning right now at idle and they're
actually kind of loud I'd hate to hear
what it sounds like under load plus the
whole system in general I put my
microphone my love in here I want to get
clipped by a fan it's freaking me out
it's a little bit noisy in there and
we're not even doing anything so that
needs to change at the very least the
power supply isn't bad you know it's a
corsair CX 750 watt so enough wattage to
drive the system but it's a little bit
on the budget side and it being
completely non modular is also an
indication that maybe it's time to step
that up as well the storage options are
he has a 480 gig SSD I forget the model
number it might be a patriot drive and
the WD blue mechanical hard drive no
problems there but I saved the best for
last ladies and gents the case which is
from say go yep yeah it's some Chinese
brand I've never heard it before and it
looks like a cheap Chinese case the side
panel and front panel or acrylic so
they're all scratched up and scuffed and
stuff we also got some ventilation on
the sides here those holes aren't super
big or anything and these fans are again
kind of noisy they are moving some air
though so I guess that's good I wonder
how much they're actually pulling in
through these slim ventilation slots on
the sides you get a somewhat decent
power supply shroud with a couple fan
mounting points at the top but you don't
have any rubber grommets for routing
cables so it doesn't look as nice as it
could they're just you know basic
cutouts and we've also got this foot
this foot that looks like he was super
glued on to the cake what happened there
Sebastian what is this an arts and
crafts project some other things to
point out is that you have to be
absolutely blind to not notice the cable
management is a chore
and the rear fan is backwards it's
mounted as an intake what's happening
here so clearly you can see I've got my
hands full for today but I'm gonna do my
best to revamp the system as best as
possible and hopefully give Sebastian
the glorious PC gaming experience he
deserves although you know I hardly know
the kid he could be a serial killer with
that gruesome question in mind it's also
worth pointing out that coolermaster has
agreed to sponsor today's video and
they'll be helping me help Sebastian
acquire some seriously awesome hardware
pun intended and they've also informed
me that they have actual PC components
being sold now at select Best Buy's
across the United States so I thought
it'd be kind of cool for this first
round of upgrades we actually went to
our local Best Buy to see what they've
got in store quite literally and bring
back whatever we find attractive alright
so we're here at a Best Buy somewhere in
downtown Los Angeles and I'm ready to do
some shopping I've got my cart ready
quite a nice selection here from
Coolermaster you can get their
peripherals in like over 700 different
locations across the US and 52 stores
are currently selling their components
if you're trying to build your own PC so
we're gonna see what works here for a
Sebastian's build in particular starting
with power supply needs a new power
supply so we have these two options from
coolermaster from their MWe
Gold Series 650 watt and 750 now
Sebastian already has
cx-7 50 watt unit from corsair first
starters it's 80 plus bronze which isn't
terrible but if we're planning to put in
a higher-end GPU having that extra
efficiency rating isn't a bad thing
necessarily and also it's not modular at
all so I think we're actually gonna swap
in one of these this is 80 plus gold
certified so we get a lot higher
efficiency and being fully modular just
allows for a lot more room in the system
when all is said and done 9999
you think getting sebastian is worth
$100 power supply I think we also have a
couple different coolers from
Coolermaster including their master
liquid ml 120 l RGB and a hyper 212 RGB
Black Edition they also have the non RGB
version at select Best Buy's although
they're completely sold out at this one
because they're just just flying off the
shelves now being a 9600 K system we
want a little bit more room for our
cooling potential especially if we plan
to overclock with a Z 390 motherboard
that will be dropping in writer so let
me see if we can find a higher end
cooler on the Best Buy website a Oh
and the first thing that pops up is a
fridge so it looks like Coolermaster
does have their master liquid ml 240 our
RGB and a 360 model I think we're gonna
have to go with one of those I'm not
gonna buy it just yet but this is
looking good so far now I don't know
exactly what case we're gonna go with
yet so we're gonna want to cram a couple
RGB fans in there just to add some
additional bling and most importantly
some healthy airflow to keep the rest of
the components cool so these are the
master fan MF 120 ra RGB let's take a
little ganda over here cuz I thought I
saw some per EPS
now obviously these are gonna be outside
of the computer but I think Sebastian
could use an upgrade I mean I'm not
exactly sure what keyboard he has now
but can't be better than this this is
the SK 650 genuine Cherry MX red
switches low-profile switches as well
very tactile the MM 830 optical sensor
24,000 dpi hidden d-pad OLED display
I've actually got to put my hands on one
of these before and it's extremely
comfortable I love the shape I don't see
any Coolermaster headsets on the shelves
they do have an MH 7 50 to 7.5% a so
we're pretty much good to go let's head
back home and get this all put together
all right well that was kind of fun got
to do a little IRL window-shopping and I
got to see the one thing that few gamers
ever make contact with the Sun but yeah
most of the things you see here are
items that we picked up at Best Buy or
their site you can see I actually picked
up a master liquid ML 240 our RGB from
Coolermaster which will do a fine job of
cooling our 9600 K it's a bit overkill
unless you can actually overclock it
which with this new motherboard we
certainly can we have a Z 390 orest Pro
y5 board from gigabyte this not only has
more connectivity and features than
Sebastian's existing B 360 board but it
also allows us to have our way with that
9600 K and it's multiplier so very
excited to be using that certainly
justifies the 240 millimeter AIO we also
have the SL 600 M from coolermaster they
hooked Sebastian up with this chassis an
absolutely just stunning case visually
speaking and of course it's subjective
but I think it's one of their nicest
looking cases ever I'd also uses a
chimney style effect with its airflow
design so you actually have all your
intake coming from the bottom of the
case and being ejected out the top it
should be a really fun and interesting
case to build and I'm actually pretty
excited because I've never worked with
the SL 600 M until now on that note we
should probably start gutting
Sebastian's PC before merging all of his
usable parts with this shiny new hot
all right getting down to the wire here
we've already installed all the parts
that we showed off earlier you can see I
mounted the RGB lighting controller for
our AIO
right here I had to remove one of the
SSD trays to make it fit fortunately
it's got a magnetic back it's not the
strongest magnet though so I might get
some adhesive velcro in there but that's
like an okay for now everything else is
in good order we only have a couple more
parts to go before we're completely done
so we're gonna bling things up a little
bit this is pimp my rig after all with
the cable mod RGB wide beam LED strip
kit you get one of these for about 3035
bucks or so they're not addressable RGB
but the lighting is extremely bright and
the colors are pretty accurate we also
have sleeve cables from antic this is
the first time I've caught wind that
antec makes sleeved cables and they
actually look like they're pretty good
quality at least from what I can tell
looking through the window they're so
excited to try these out and then
finally we have the GPU situation now of
course Sebastian has a very respectable
gtx 1070 TI but again it's a pretty
basic model there's no backplate and
it's a it's a bit noisy plus he's
currently gaming on 1080 panels so I
kind of wanted to bump him up to 1440p
so with all those things in mind I got
him one of these yeah I did I did a
thing this is the Auris extreme r-tx
2080 water force from gigabyte water
force meaning that we actually have a
240 millimeter radiator AIO fixed to the
GPU but to accommodate this extremely
high end GPU we're actually gonna have
to remove the two 200 millimeter fins
that are at the bottom of the case these
come pre-installed so once those fans
are out we're gonna mount our 240
millimeter rad right there at the bottom
as intake so we're gonna still keep the
the chimney effect by creating a
vertical airflow path that'll exhaust
out the top so that's what we're doing
and by the time I install this we will
be done and I'll show you the finished
product
just a bit
all rights built complete and looking
pretty sweet quite a feat actually to
build something so neat yeah it's
looking really good I love how it turned
out
both cosmetically and functionally
speaking the SL 600 M was a very nice
case to build it it's definitely unique
you saw from the montage that our
storage actually went at the front of
the case right with our SSD and hard
drive just below it and then just behind
that was our power supply with all of
our cable managing a good majority of it
going on right behind this plate that
would otherwise be covering a bunch of
drive trays or drive cages in a more
conventional chassis and also just due
to the layout of the case we have our
radiator for the GPU mounted to the
bottom as opposed to what would
ordinarily be the front intake so it
definitely gives the system a unique
appearance that I think looks pretty
cool and Coolermaster took a lot of
risks with this case but I think most of
them paid off because my build
experience with it was very positive
overall additionally I should mention
that our GPU is mounted vertically the
SL 600 M has two vertical slots but it
did not come included with a PCI riser
cable so I actually had to pull one from
my cable mod PCIe vertical GPU bracket
kind of just snagged it from there and
it worked like a charm the main reason I
mounted it this way was not only to show
off the LEDs on the shroud there but
also to create a more direct airflow
path and to not impede the air flow
that's coming from these front fans
because this is really the only intake
that we have in the system and it's
firing straight up towards the CPU a
radiator so if the GPU was mounted
horizontally it would be blocking a lot
of the air that those fans are pushing
up so it was kind of a form and function
decision on my
so there it is guys in all of its glory
I think Sebastian will have a good time
gaming on this thing which reminds me
Sebastian actually mentioned that he's
currently gaming on a few 1080p TN
panels or twisted nematic panels which
is fine at all totally fine it actually
is probably a very nice setup for his
old PC but with an RT X 2080 I think
we're we're craving a little bit more
pixel pushing so I kind of wanted to up
him to 1440p perhaps and well I also
admire how fast TN panels are I'm also
well aware of their various shortcomings
when it comes to things like color
reproduction and viewing angle and so
forth so I thought since we're already
upgrading his keyboard and mouse why not
throw in a panel - well well well
what do we have here this is a beauty
have a monitor the AOC agon this thing's
pretty sweet 27 inches 2560 by 1440 I
thought it was IPS but upon further
inspection it's actually a VA panel
which is just as good in my book we also
have display gr 400 ignore that free
sync to HDR yes I'm aware that we have a
GeForce GPU from Nvidia but free C 2
will work perfectly fine this is most
likely gonna be a decent compatible
display we also have 144 Hertz not too
shabby
alright so special thanks to AOC for
sending this over go ahead and check
them out I'll put some links in the
description if you want to learn more
about this panel or the rest of their
products on that notes and I think it's
time for the big reveal
I'm super excited to see Sebastian's
reaction to this whole setup and bear in
mind guys you know a lot of people who
are on this show they might be a little
introverted or just a bit camera shy
just because they don't give an
explosive reaction when they see their
new system doesn't mean they're not
appreciative or overwhelmed or feeling a
lot of things internally I see a lot of
comments
that's why I'm saying this guys you
don't know what it's like to be
surprised like that in front of the
world's greatest youtuber it's just the
things that go through your mind is just
it's a bit overwhelming for most people
now the last thing I'll mention here is
that if you're feeling a little jelly of
Sebastian right now you should consider
entering cooler masters found it best by
giveaway the grand prize winner gets a
huge pile of hardware including an H 500
ml 120 L RGB cooler CK 530 and more
second and third place winners get
hooked up with some really nice gear too
so if you're feeling lucky head to the
link in the description below to enter
for a chance to win on that note I think
it's time that we show Sebastian his
new gaming setup let's do it all right
man this is the moment we've been
waiting for any any thoughts going
through your mind I just know I don't
know you have first of all what have you
been doing this whole week without a
system I've just my phone basically is
it an open game Elam I've had to resort
to mobile gaming I'm sorry to have to
have to put you through that but I
promise the wait was worth it you have
any expectations for what might be under
the screen sheet I can see it as bigger
so that's basically it so the only thing
you know really is if there's a case
upgrade it's very yes okay what you
really really need it yeah are you ready
to see your new system yeah here it is
man I hope you like it
Oh as you can see there's a couple
different things case that's like Oh
is that are those good are those good
gasps or bad gasps that's it's so good
what yeah so we we thought we thought
you deserved a GPU upgrade as well so we
have created you to a a gigabyte Oris
extreme r-tx 2080 oh my god
has an AI Oh fixed to it so it's
actually water-cooled you can see we
also switched you from air cooling to
liquid cooling on the CPU as well so you
still have the 9600 K as we both know
you were on B 360 so you couldn't even
overclock right right now we have your
chip to 4.8 gigahertz on all course
that's what the help of the the Auris
motherboard as well so you're on
so you're on to 390 now this thing
should hopefully make your minesweeper
experience a lot more enjoyable
any thoughts let me know you think I I
just don't know what to say it looks
amazing it's just that's so much better
than my old computer it just looks
amazing that's it yeah it's always kind
of difficult with these things when you
know clients are kind enough to let me
work on their systems everyone has such
a different personal taste right read
statics and stuff so it's like I'm kind
of shooting in the dark apart from a
couple questions that I asked you at the
beginning so I never quite know how
people are gonna react or how much
they're actually gonna like the systems
that I put together but it seems like
you like it
so yeah I'm glad it I'm glad it worked
out it's just stunning
it's just amazing thank you so much that
the surprise doesn't end there
everything you see on this table is now
yours oh my god
so we have the AOC monitor 2560 by 1440
IPS 144 Hertz curved display peripherals
by Cooler Master we even threw in an RGB
mouse pad for you it's amazing
yeah man Congrats on your new setup but
yeah huge shout out to everyone who put
this together for you especially
Coolermaster couldn't be possible
without you guys AOC and gigabyte came
to the rescue as well with with a lot of
things to see here so a huge huge thanks
to those guys thank you so much yeah of
course yeah give me a hug give me a this
is this is hug this is how where they
stuff I'm glad you like the system so
much dude that's gonna do it for now
guys make sure you toss a like on the
video if you enjoyed it get subscribe
for more tech stuff coming at you really
soon and I will see you in the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
