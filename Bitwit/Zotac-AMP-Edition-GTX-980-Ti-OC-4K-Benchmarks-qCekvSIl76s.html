enthusiasts apparel awesomesauce shirts
are not only threaded they're hyper
threaded and come factory overclocked
get yours today at the awesomesauce two
walls of gas so it wasn't too long ago
when we all went crazy over the big
release of nvidia gtx 980ti
but fast forward a month or so and we're
still seeing a handful of custom
variants pop up from adding board
partners keeping the hype of new videos
latest card ever so real and with the
promise of better thermals lower
acoustics and more performance it's not
hard to see why so today I'll be taking
a look at the gtx 980ti
amp edition from ZOTAC Zoet ax amp
signature indicates the card has been
factory overclocked this one in
particular sees a core clock increase to
1051 megahertz and a boost clock to
eleven hundred and forty over the
reference model that's a fifty one and
sixty five megahertz boost respectively
but I quickly found in my testing that
the cards boost clock was able to hit
around twelve hundred and fifty
megahertz due to the favorable thermal
conditions in my office this performance
boost brought to you by Lance Armstrong
here the rest of the specs including the
GM 200 mm 816 CUDA cores and ample six
gigabyte frame buffer at the reference
speed of seventeen hundred and fifty
three megahertz keeping things cool on
the dual slot card is so tax ice storm
cooler which features 390 millimeter
fans that stay put until the GPU is
under load in order to save power and
suppress fan noise the acoustic aid is
wasted here however as the fans are
virtually inaudible even when they do
spin up and that's a just two feet away
from me with the cases side panel off no
wind noise no high-pitched whirring of
any kind I mean at one point I had to
physically get up to see if the fans
were actually spinning and sure enough
it was exhausting no not the card
physically getting up so kudos otac not
every vendor can make a high-end card as
quiet as this one let alone one that
gets me off my ass the large aluminum
heatsink and copper heat pipes are
partially enclosed by a gray shroud of
metal and plastic construction
accompanied by some water transfer
printing that gives the card a sporty
carbon-fiber appearance while the
coolers length of 301 millimeters is
reserved for larger chassis z' Maxx
as a claimed power efficiency is
suitable for more modest power supplies
sporting at least one six pin and one
eight pin PCIe cable on the same side as
your power connectors you'll find some
ZOTAC branding in the center and a small
section of the full cover back plate
that reads push the limit quite simply
the most clever insertion of a Quick
Start Guide I've seen to date a nifty
aesthetic trait of the back plate is
that it extends past the PCB and wraps
around the front of the card where it
meets the fan shroud effectively hiding
the thin array for a more uniform look
finally at the back you get the same
video outputs as found on the reference
model including dual link DVI HDMI and
three display ports for 4k resolution at
60 Hertz for benchmarking I used my
5820k system running Windows 8.1 and was
able to push the limit of the cards
factory clock speed to fourteen hundred
and seventy-three megahertz a seemingly
negligible 1 to 2 percent increase over
my reference overclocked temp se√±al my
tests maxed out at 68 degrees Celsius a
solid 17 degrees cooler than the
reference card hopefully this means
we'll see some noticeable performance
gains via GPU boost as we now have a
higher thermal ceiling for our GPU temp
target as I mentioned earlier the fans
on the amp Edition were so quiet that
I'm still trying to shake off the
uncomfortable silence between us so
let's fire up some melodic mayhem as we
check out the benchmarks
as you can see from the results both
cards stay competitive at 4k with the
exception of a 19% lead for the amp
edition in Metro last light once we drop
down to lower resolutions however ZOTAC
takes home some landslide victories that
are a clear indication of its
overclocking prowess aided enlarge by
its ability to stay 26% cooler on
average than the reference model I'm
still on the notion that single GPU
cards won't be fully ready for 4k until
2016 which by that I mean will see
consistent average frame rates topping
60 FPS on most maxed out triple-a titles
in the meantime the gtx 980ti can churn
through 1440 with ease and the influx of
quad HD g-sync monitors makes this combo
all the more compelling for us gamers
now as for ZOTAC s-- amp edition this is
the first custom variant of the 980 TI
that i've personally spent any time with
so i honestly can't compare it to other
offerings from competing AIB partners
what I can tell you is that it blows the
reference model out of the water in
three of what I consider the big four
characteristics for any video card being
performance thermals acoustics and power
consumption being awash in this case
it's a shining example of wily wait the
extra month or two after the reference
cards released to market and while I
personally agree that Zoet acts loud and
proud sporty aesthetic isn't for
everyone
I have to admit that it checks all the
boxes for what I look for in a card at
this price point but let me know what
you guys think of this thing in the
comments below and don't forget to toss
me a like on this video if you enjoyed
it before you go check out my store you
can pick up an awesomesauce shirts not
like this one and in case you didn't
hear my CPU cooler shirt is back in
stock but is quickly selling out again
which makes me wonder how many of you
were watching me naked beforehand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
