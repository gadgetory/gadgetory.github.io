watching those videos and yeah and then
we didn't do last week's show because I
just recently got back super jet-lagged
I'm still fairly jet-lagged much better
than I was last week but bear in mind my
half of the show might be a little low
energy we'll have to rely on Paul to
kick things up a notch and maybe do a
song and dance at some point it's a lot
of pressure yeah just a little bit but I
will also have a relatively brief 1/2 so
we can get on to more interesting stuff
on Paul's half as well I'll be talking
about just piling it on no I have a
decent half planned out we're gonna be
talking about rising three thousand
again mainly because it's in the
headlines everywhere it's the big news
that we've been hearing about after copy
text and now III after the announcements
that they that AMD made yesterday was
just yesterday right yeah yeah yeah we
were there we were there two days ago on
Sunday right
yeah had all that information dropped on
us so yeah it's it's probably you know
something that you've already heard of
all this all these news articles and
stuff but we're gonna just sort of
discuss it in a more open format here on
the live stream and give you guys our
personal opinions and after that we're
gonna switch gears oh yeah we're also
gonna talk about e3 I know it's still
going on apparently today's the first
day I for some reason I had in my head
that e3 and me going on for like a day
or two because everything happens before
e3 now it's like if yeah I didn't tell
actually three to drop yours old near
demo or whatever like Yeah right
bored by then yeah exactly you gotta
kick things off really everyone goes
home on the first day of e3 yep so we're
gonna be doing a recap of what's been
unveiled so far all the highlights that
stood out to T'Pol and I and then we'll
transition to Paul's half in about half
an hour or so where we'll talk about
Navi and the greatness that that lies in
there and what else are we talking about
briefly on your on your hand Paul we're
gonna we're gonna do like opinion stuff
we're gonna tell our opinions about
things and we're gonna ask the audience
what their opinions are of things - yes
because that's important yep thank God
you guys think yep those people might
actually so all right let's go ahead and
jump into the show here we do this every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on Twitch
on TV / awesome hardware we also stream
the show into two halves this week the
first half is on my channel of course
bit with tech / No youtube.com slash bit
wit then with tech is my merchandise
store but then about half an hour more
room switch over to Paul's which is
Paul's hardware No
youtube.com slash Paul's hardware it's
been a while since I've done the show
speaking of that it's a very rocky
transition into our merchandise stores -
talked about your stores exactly so we
have the store making of a store or buy
buy something from us all proceeds go to
us you can pick up a screw with
confidence shirt in two different
flavors there's also the usual Flair of
pint pint glasses mugs hoodies don't buy
a hoodie right now it's hot it's hot as
hell at least where we are here in
Australia yeah oh yeah there you go it's
a very situational Paul store is Paul's
hardware next and he's also got his
captive thumbscrew shirt I was actually
gonna wear mine my captain thumbscrew
shirt today but it's a little too small
for me I didn't check to see what size
it was that I think maybe John sent over
our merch guy but I was gonna wear as
well Rach this I gave you that one
wasn't didn't you get a medium I didn't
I didn't double-check you probably has a
medium I'm just getting fat so maybe
that's a knock on my door there slim
Jack actually responded to one of John's
emails today and I was so brief I need
to ask him for one of these shirts in my
size because I only had oh yeah I think
we got Excel and a large or something or
XLS medium Adam okay point is they're
great shirts everyone everyone buy them
yes
everyone do and then we occasionally use
adult language on the show only when
when specifically warranted so it's all
it's all for a good reason but if you're
sensitive that sort of thing be warned
and we like to have a drink or two on
stream so yep thanks for thanks for
watching with us let's move on to our
first segment which is tech news diving
right in here
just coming out right right right right
away with the bangers AMD risin 939 50x
which was announced a couple days ago
this is an article from an antic our
good friend and colleague Ian cut
restrict us up I think you might very
much dr. Ian cut up with him the other
day yes yeah I wish I get to talk to him
more but
someone from AMD stole me away and then
I was like super tired after that but
Ian's awesome we love him we love his
articles especially this one on the
16-core risin risin family risin nine
should they always seem to be you know
the nomenclatures always seem to kind of
follow each other from competitor to
competitor get the i9 9900 k now I've
got the risin 939 50x it says bunch of
copycats in the industry you know the
cool thing just like what the complete
polar opposite direction but that's ok
it's really the tech that counts here
and my god there's there's a lot of
things to be excited about with this
part 16 core 32 thread so they're
keeping a simultaneous multi-threaded
functionality here for $749 us that's a
baby
that's pretty competitive when you
consider that Intel 16 core offering is
almost twice that actually it's about
twice that it's like 1,500 1,600 dollars
on Amazon and Newegg that's the 79 60 X
that's actually the part I'm using right
now in my current workstation it might
be interesting to do a little standoff
once once the 39 50 X is ready between
those two parts I was kind of curious
what the Red River I mean it's not it's
it's not apples to apples because
they're too pristine sugar for two is
still on 12 nanometer and stuff it's
using the Zen plus architecture but 830
dollars not much more so yeah when the
original 1950 ex launched it was a
thousand right but it dropped pretty
quick yeah and then what 79 60 yeah yeah
that's gonna be 15 for the 1500 look at
that 15 good lord
t 2 and in a much higher power envelope
there 165 Watts versus what a hundred
and five on this one 105 that's crazy
how are they able to do that I mean we
kind of know right 7 animator
architecture with a lot of other
refinements yeah but I was considering
more but I mean you compare that because
because the 3800 X which is 8 cores
which is 8 core is 105 Watts the 3900 X
which is 12 core yeah is 105 watts so
what you're gonna be looking at here cuz
I was considering this myself
just the other day is you've got these
boost frequencies 4.7 gigahertz 4.6
gigahertz 4.5 gigahertz that's unlike
one or two course yeah that's gonna be
for your gaming and stuff like that
right you know I'm sure people will
overclock the question that for me is
gonna be like what kind of heat output
are we're gonna see from this thing if
we try to run over see it all cores at
four point four four point five or four
point six or eight like that right
this does seem to me to indicate that
there may be getting better Chi bins
chips for the 3950 X which they've done
before yep
with Red River for example right but
this what this means is that the base
frequency like when it's on all 16 cores
it's running at 3.5 yeah so in order to
stay within that TDP and again we're
assuming here that they're not doing
finicky things with TDP because Intel
does that right which is you can't trust
there to be any kind of tricky of them
yeah but we'll see once these parts X
will actually launch what they're
running at when it comes to the number
of cores that are engaged in the
frequency it's actually writing it right
it'll it'll run all the cores at a lower
frequency in order to stay within that
TDP it does make sense because the first
I was like oh the boost how's the boost
frequency higher on that part and still
retaining the same TDP as the eight core
part it's like oh well it's got a lower
base frequency than the other parts as
well so because it kind of evens out a
six core an eight core a 12 core or a 16
core if any of those chips are just
running one or two of the cores at a
high frequency it's gonna be about the
same yeah I'm at a power usage and heat
output right about yeah I'm leaving
myself some very sure but it's just a
couple cores there but yeah this is uh
this is gonna be a beast of a CPU you
know some people are wondering if it's
gonna compete with you know thread
Ripper but at the same time I feel like
a lot of people a lot of like content
creators workstation people need
quad-channel memory support um you know
ECC do we know if ECC support is on x5
70 I think yes because it has
historically been available to some
degree with Rison down that's also up to
another board manufacturer it's just
right to implement support for it and
they have pro's Pro versions of like all
the 2000 series and 1000 series
processors then trade have I think
better ECC support right yeah I'm not an
expert on there
let's get asleep or believe it yeah some
more it's more details here the chips
using to Zen to 8-quart shifflet's
with an iodine that offers 24 PCIe gen 4
lanes
first of its kind to AMD's claiming it
to be faster in single and multi
threaded performance then the rivaling
70-79 60 x16 core part from Intel at
half the price interestingly this is
going to launch about two months after
the rest of the products deck comes
around in September so we got June
seventh 7/7 for pretty much all the
rising parts except for the 39 50 X
which will launch September later this
year not be - on June 7 now be - on June
7th July 7 July says July 7th which
we'll be talking more on Paul's half so
yeah pretty exciting stuff there this is
all something that we kind of expected
when Lisa Lisa sufer showed off the
actual CPU and there was like an empty
slot there for an additional chip late--
that could that could potentially house
eight more cores and fortunately we were
right so looking forward to getting
these on the test bench but let's talk
briefly about the other rise in 3,000
parts really briefly because this has
already kind of been drilled into
everyone but we've got five SKUs here on
top of that 16 core including the six
core 12 thread Rison five thirty six
hundred and thirty six hundred x so this
is gonna be sort of the same thing where
the X cube parts are a little bit faster
out of the box they're gonna cost a
little bit more we're looking at 199 us
for the 3600 and 249th and 3600 x they
have better coolers - better coolers
yeah that's that's definitely worth
noting and but still very very power
efficient chips we have the risin 730
700 X and 3800 X these are both 8 core
16 thread parts and that's gonna go for
329 and 399 u.s. dollars respectively
and finally we have the 12 core 24
thread 3900 X which is going to watch
499 US dollars you really see AMD's sort
of covering like all the possible price
points ranging from 200 all the way up
to 750 dollars they're trying to cover
all their bases so no matter what your
budget is risin this is definitely an
option so yeah I'm actually most curious
I think about the 16 core in the 12th
red part just because we've got more
cores than we've ever seen before
it's an industry-first by all means and
everyone's very excited but we can move
on to the next little article here which
is from actually this is a Reddit rumor
I shouldn't say this is article at all
at all I just caught this right before
the show started thought I'd just throw
it in here to see what you guys think
and have a brief discussion there's a
rumor that X 570 boards might be priced
about $100 more than their X 470
counterparts so that would mean if
there's like a natural successor like
you've got the rampage or I'm sorry like
the the crosshair extreme or crosshair 7
hero versus the crosshair 8 hero there'd
be a disparity of $100 they're thoughts
thoughts on the possibility of this
rumor and and and how you would react if
it were true Paul well interesting you
should bring this up we can't confirm
this also by the way we don't we don't
know the pricing of X 570 board some of
them have been teased but one thing we
do know is that if you go back to couple
generations to when Rison first launched
the motherboard availability for first
gen risin was way worse than what you
have now it was improved with the the
400 series when that came out now we
have the 500 series and just to be clear
the way AMD is positioning this there is
no plans at least as far as we know for
a B 550 chipset right X 570 is going to
be the premium top tier if u want PCI
Express 4.0 you need to buy an x5 70
motherboard and presumably though there
might be some other features there that
you also get along with with X 570 the
block diagram is up 4 X 5 70 as far as
all the i/o
that's available there and stuff but
what we have now that we didn't have
with first gen and even with second gen
is we have top-tier motherboards
so like MSI for example has their
godlike or and creation motherboards
that they have in the past
previously they've only had the that
class of motherboard on an Intel side
right same thing I think goes four
gigabytes highest and Oris and I'm not
sure about Asus or not if they're gonna
have higher version ROG boards besides
the crosshair or anything but we are now
seeing like ultra premium AMD mainstream
motherboards which from one perspective
is kind of cool
because that wasn't available before and
especially if you go back to first gen
you can kind of see motherboard
manufacturers not wanting to like do too
much of an investment right off the bat
because they didn't know how it was
gonna perform and everything yeah now a
couple years later it has been doing
very well right AMD seems poised to
actually even be doing kind of a sea
change when it comes to what's viewed as
the best processors to get um you know
pending independent reviews and
everything of course but we now have
super premium motherboards like over
Bilt's power delivery and everything for
Andy's main stream platform yeah that's
cool but yes those types of motherboards
typically cost more yeah the the B 450
and B 350 series have been very popular
I think with people cuz you could be
like look you only need to spend one
hundred two hundred and fifty like one
hundred two hundred and twenty dollars
on a motherboard probably and you're
fine you don't need anything more than
that you know yes x4 70 has been there
and stuff with the higher end features
and the support for two-way graphics and
everything like that yeah
but you know most of most people don't
need that so it made it a much more
compelling budget option yeah
now we're gonna be seeing is like super
premium rise in 3000 series built with
750 dollars 16 core processors right
motherboards that probably do costs
upwards of $300 yeah and there might be
a you know a certain
nitch part of the AMD community who's
like yes you know we're really excited
for those but a lot of people might look
at that and be like oh gosh in order to
get onto this new platform now there's
this additional barrier to entry which
is the higher price and yeah I mean
that's that's the two sides of it as
best as I can explain off the top of my
head but I think there will be lower end
x5 70 motherboards they're not all gonna
be the godlike creation whatever
versions yeah I saw some that at
Computex I was like okay that looks like
more of a targeted mainstream or
whatever if you're if you're on a slight
budget or something but I think what a
lot of people are like are thinking
right now in their heads they're looking
at X 570 as the natural successor to X
470 and it's kind of confusing right
because you have X 370 x 470 X 570 the
way they're named makes you think that
this is just a sort of lateral move and
that it's gonna be this exact
replacement for X 471 that's not
necessarily the case this is a more
premium platform that AMD is rolling out
for more premium CPUs when you're
talking about 12 core and 16 core parts
that have a lot more built-in features
like PCIe gen 4 not everyone needs PCIe
gen for this is a very sort of niche
feature that people with super fast
storage needs and really high quality
really high-end editing workflows
require so of course those those parts
are going to cost more money because the
demands are more more robust or they're
more more demanding so I feel like for
people who are looking for a risin 5
let's say a 3rd gen or rising 3,000 rise
in 5 part you're gonna be ok with like
an X 470 board or even to be 450 board
you don't necessarily need in fact I
probably wouldn't recommend people go
out and buy an x5 70 board unless they
were trying to get like a 3800 X or
above right maybe something a bit more
demand and also how our requirements and
also hopefully planning to do something
that takes advantage of the PCI Express
4.0 exactly a lot of people in chat are
pointing out right now PCI Express Gen 4
which is a big selling point upgrade
feature of the new platform in the new
series of processor and the question is
going to be who's going to use that like
don't upgrade to PCI Express 4.0
if you don't have some idea that you're
planning to use it it's not going to
make a drastic difference when it comes
to GPU poor performance for example yeah
do you also the least remain
I don't think PCI Express Gen 4 support
is something that is contributing to the
costs of these higher and x5 70
motherboards I think there's a lot of
actually 400-series motherboards that
could run PCI Express 4.0 just fine it
has to do with the Tres layouts and how
they're designed and the length of them
and it's specifically keeping the length
to a certain length so that the signal
integrity can be kept up I wouldn't be
surprised if you if we see sort of
hacked in bios's for 400 series
motherboards that allow you to run PCI
Express 4.0 with a 3000 series processor
that's just a guess from me but I could
see like asrock doing that and then
other motherboard vendors coming in and
doing it too or maybe an idea it would
be up to AMD to tell them no don't do
that
or what if could you see them making
like an X 470 board that supports PCIe
gen for like a new one I do that just
for the trace layout so they can
actually wire the trace layouts properly
ID but then I don't see that happening
octopus cooling on the chipset you know
lower tbp on the chipset and stuff lower
price the chipset by the way and this is
kind of just an interesting little
tidbit if you guys if you guys have seen
the the pictures of the rise in 3000
series chips and there's a two little
chip let's each of those can have our
eight core
little chip --let's that's kind of what
rises and then to is built on and then
there's a larger chip that's the i/o die
the i/o die that's on the the rise in
3000 series seriously if you use is the
exact same chip that's in the chipset
right they use the same 70 range yeah
the next 570 chipset yeah I just thought
that was kind of interesting so there
were a lot of questions bouncing around
about that and I don't have all the
answers to them like for instance that
IO die has the memory controller on it
for example so like when you put that
and use it as a chipset you don't really
need the memory controller this is just
disabled this is actually
any work and the one on the chipsets
twelve nanometer and then we got 40
nanometer on the IO die for the CPU that
also was being asked in the sessions and
I don't
that was probably clarified after the
fact but I don't know the answer to it
right now on amount of songs it's it's
yeah they were trying to figure out
whether that the the IO die is twelve
nanometer manufacturing process or 14
nanometer and II am 4 X 570 chipset is
the matisse ayodhya fabbed and 14
nanometer instead of 12 nanometer can't
trust as a german yeah that was one of
the questions in the and the sessions we
were at the event we were at on sunday
that people were trying to try to figure
out but apparently there's a cell so
thank you for your efforts in trying to
kill the spam bots in youtube chat
thanks up is they suck XXX real poor and
click here
oh no fuck that guy cuz that's not a
girl that's a kiss okay oh yeah there
are no girls in chat not on our stream
unless it's wifey sauce alright well
it's very very very a lot of a question
to be answered especially when it comes
to the performance of these chips which
I'm sure we'll have more information for
you guys very soon but for now let's
move on to some some fun stuff some some
light-hearted takeaways from e3 so far
even though this was technically the
first official day of the event there
have been a lot of press events that
have been held in the last couple days
that have revealed quite a lot already
so I actually took to Twitter earlier
today and asked you guys what what stood
out to you so far and sort of gathered
the loudest voices there and and all of
your fan favorites so we're gonna start
off with the hardware Xbox project
Scarlett the next-generation
Xbox console from Microsoft has been a
huge talking point around the event so
far and some interesting hardware packed
in here
we were just this is also a perfect
segue we were just talking about Zen 2
and AMD these units will be powered by
Zen 2 processors these SOC s will be 4
times more powerful than the Xbox
one I don't know if that necessarily
equates to four times the performance
but you know powerful is very generic
term so I guess take that loosely but
we're also seeing performance up to 120
FPS with real-time hardware accelerated
rate racing which I thought was kind of
funny because we're not even gonna see
hardware supported rate racing on the
Navi GPUs yeah that was weird at that to
figure out what they're what they've got
going on with that right so what the
heck is processing the rate racing there
and being curious to find out and then
we've got 8k support because you know so
many people have 8k monitors and TVs now
that you just need to need to be at the
forefront of that but I guess it makes
sense you know 4k is already pretty
mainstream when it comes to TVs at least
which is probably what most consoles are
being connected to so make sense that 8k
is the natural progression there we've
already seen some people testing out
testing out a k8k gaming and cough -
cough
but yeah so 8k support it's gonna be
interesting to see what games are gonna
look like running at 8k probably 60 fps
I would think cuz you probably couldn't
do you couldn't do 8k at 120fps there's
no way in hell DisplayPort 1.4 which is
the current standard but the latest and
greatest is 4k 120 fps supported so I
would think that if you're jumping up to
8k in supported games you'd probably be
dumping down to 60 FPS but don't quote
me on that
I don't include an SSD there will they
live there keeping the disk drive
there's a lot of talk you know after
especially after the last gen Xbox or
the current gen Xbox I should say
released a all digital version of the
unit which didn't have a disc tray
because optical media's for suckers or
whatever people were speculating that
the next gen just default baseline
console at launch would not have one at
all but it looks like Microsoft is
seeing the value in people who still own
discs and purchase hardware still
something to be said for the physical
inexpensive
to stamp optical media and distribute it
for games and also for people who have
metered internet connections to be able
to take that first 20 gigs or however
many and load it off the disk before you
have to download the inevitable patch
that right is required on day one right
can be helpful foot so I grew I
understand that move yeah yeah apps I
mean absolutely well I mean there are
probably people very few but probably
you know some gamers out there who have
their Xboxes connected offline you know
and they just who knows that they love
single-player campaign I keep mine
offline as much as possible yeah but I
mainly use it to watch 4k sure blu-rays
so yeah use it as a entertainment HD PC
you almost but then they're also gonna
have a halo infinite as a launch title
which we'll talk about in just a moment
this is gonna be arriving holiday 2020
people were speculating by the end of
this year now end of next year so quite
a ways away but can I just interject I
don't know what the nude sexy porn
spambots have a hard-on for your channel
but no cell is just it's just taking
care of them one after another Jesus
they keep coming back oh god they're all
different names it's like this your
stream has been targeted by why a nude
sexy porn button is it a bot I don't
know I mean it's something that keeps
sending this stupid goddamn ad people in
here I'm sorry so but you're you're
doing you're doing good I just yeah I'm
just I apologize you have to play like
whack-a-mole right now instead of
watching the show
keep it up though alright let's let's uh
let's let's dive into some of the games
let's talk about some of the games that
were launched or revealed or at least
more details shed on them today or the
last couple days so we have of course
the big one CD Projekt RED cyberpunk
2077 and I'm aware that this is probably
not kosher for me to just show gameplay
trailers just right baked into the
stream and that this video will probably
get to monetize but I don't care we
don't we don't get enough views on our
videos to really matter anyway and it
just doesn't make sense for me to not
show this to you while we talk about it
I don't give you
it's just a couple bucks so here's the
very very awesome badass cinematic
trailer for cyberpunk 2077 which is in
my opinion out of all the trailers that
I looked at for e3 so far this one
steals the show by a longshot and you
can I mean you can tell it's number 14
on trending 8 million views I think is
pretty telling with a ridiculously
overwhelmingly positive like dislike
ratio there
where's Keanu oh yeah Keanu Reeves shows
up at the end spoiler alert but we know
that's okay I think everyone knows by
now that Keanu Reeves is a actual
character in the game whether or not
he's playing himself remains to be seen
but his face and likeness is completely
encapsulated and and emulated in this
game right here they did a really good
job just with the graphics and making it
look just like him
I think comes in and says wake the fuck
up wake the fuck up
and this is very John wick right here
very neo he's he's got a Winter Soldier
arm and everything yeah yeah he's a
total he's a he's a nog it's pretty fun
total dog so this game looks freaking
awesome I actually have a friend who's
been looking into getting a gaming PC
and as soon as he saw this trailer a
couple days ago
Ian he was like I need I need a PC now I
think there's something to be said about
like just a visually striking like yeah
Bert style in this yep the Sun is
setting and everything just looks
amazing yeah it makes you want to be in
it you know it just looks so cool it has
that sort of futuristic retro vibe I
just I can't wait to see a gameplay
trailer sort of I cannot wait to see
gameplay bloom on all the lighting and
yeah and just everything like just the
story looks really good too I mean it's
CD Projekt rather the same devs you
brought you Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and all
that so I mean they know what they're
doing they know they know how to tell
stories and narratives through games
with like voice actors and stuff yeah
and definitely yeah it kind of every
other thing that I saw here when it
comes to actual quality of like the
voice acting in the storytelling kind of
pales in comparison to what I saw in the
cinematic trailer of course you know
can't judge whatever but next up we have
Star Wars Jedi fallen order
we'll just talked about this very
briefly I'm just going to give my two
cents on this it looks a little
underwhelming yeah it kinda just looks
like a rinse and repeat of I don't know
what is this like titanfall not
titanfall but kind of like Drake's
Uncharted looks a little like Uncharted
you're climbing things and then there
was also that Force Unleashed game that
came out several years ago that I didn't
play it was it was just it was it was
just a basic platformer skin with Star
Wars
glamour glitz and glamour and this kind
of looks like a rinse and repeat of
Force Unleashed which I was kind of
hoping to see a little bit more
innovation a little bit more different
mechanics in the game play the the
setting and the environment is all again
the skin is nice it's Star Wars it's the
music that you love and the characters
you want to see but the gameplay itself
just looks a little bit boring in my in
my book you know once you do the force
you know the force grab and the force
smash and stuff and you're reflecting
bullets onto stormtroopers after the
first half an hour to an hour I'm sure
like the game needs something else to
keep you going so I hope it's not just
like a you know a button mash these a
lot of climbing you know I don't
remember this much climbing in any of
the Star Wars games but apparently it's
a very prevalent part of the Star Wars
franchise you could do a force of jump
if you're like a Jedi and just jump
really far up there yeah right yeah he's
not he's not utilizing his talents oh
yeah Tomb Raider I get a lot of very
much of a Tomb Raider vibe as well yeah
you can again there's like probably a
dozen or so half a dozen games that you
can point to and be like oh that's from
this game oh that's from this game so it
kind of feels like a mishmash of repeat
content but you know who's to say until
the reviews are out you know I've seen
the same thing about GPUs and look he
has a
backpack and there's a Wookiee era there
is a Wookiee you know again characters
you love and then this robot fucker
that's about to creep up on his ass and
give him the OL give him the old dress
bar so that droids name in the last
order I forget I only remember so ok
that's ok to us so yeah there is always
on top of it so next up we have halo
infinite halo infinite which what I've I
did play quite a bit of halo 3 back in
the day halo 3 cuz I never had the
original Xbox but halo 3 on xbox 360 I
did play a ton of it was my friend's
Xbox 360 though so I only played when he
was around and we did multiplayer
obviously all the time very fun very fun
game spent a lot of hours in that game
don't know what to expect with Halo
infinite this is just a cinematic
trailer again again not not the most
impressive right right after you've
watched the cyberpunk 2077 I know what
you lead with that no I know I should
have led up to that because I just
wanted to again accentuate I wanted to
start off strong even if I fizzled out
at the end but you know it's kind of
boring until Master Chief shows up at
the end he kind of reboots Master Chief
system and you see you know Master Chief
come back to life is like alright it's
time to kick ass and take names
basically I'm paraphrasing I don't know
who this guy is I don't know the the
lore enough to know if this guy's
important or if he's just a new
character but there he is alright it's
kick-ass time it's very it's all very
Power Rangers to me and then at some
point the the ship just starts shaking
and they're like oh fuck things are
shits hitting the fan bro we've got to
do something
Master Chief's like leave it to me
soldier oh yeah and then their whole
little planet here their planet in the
space man-made sky thing it's all fucked
up like a Dyson Sphere or like a ring
yeah it says ring space ring their space
station their ISS it's all fucked up and
then you know he jumps out and of course
it's perfect time to cut to the to the
brand everyone crowd goes wild holiday
2020 because it's gonna launch again the
same
time as the new Xbox project Scarlett ah
so halo infinites yadda yadda yadda
it's a halo next up we have some
announcements from Nintendo starting off
with new characters yeah everyone was
pretty hot today for the ring we're
talking about is a halo oh oh yeah duh
in the name of the game halo right
thanks nothing makes sense so we've got
some new ways before we get to that okay
when it comes to Halo and like I've
never played I've never really played
the Halo game so by the way in case
that's not clear from the way I
pronounce Cortana Cortana Cortana anyway
quick town I um but we're Tanna I might
have we're gonna talk about the Xbox
subscription-based things allows you to
play xbox games on PC yeah so those of
us who you know didn't have that or
didn't get into Halo back in the day
right the Halo games not available
good good plug ball good foreshadowing
so this is a deferred one of the first
announcements from a Nintendo this at
least you can talk about with with a
fair amount of knowledge of the game
yeah because I am a bit of a smash
fanboy
okay I've loved the franchise ever since
first debuted on 964 I was a huge male a
fanatic I am nowhere near as good as
letting the pros of s beside the point
um this is a new character reveal for
banjo-kazooie you guys remember banjo
kazooie is one of the very iconic
characters of the old Nintendo days and
he's back because you know smash
ultimate biggest problem of the game is
that it doesn't have enough fucking
characters like 50-something by now more
definitely need more so yeah now we've
got banjo kazooie and his his buddy I
forget what the bird's name is it'll
it'll unveil it right here
oh no I kind of like how they did this
like oh who is it who is it it's it's
fucking duck hunt dog god dammit what
the hell you doing control there good
god I love little animations how dint
endo chooses to roll this out is very
kind of playful and whimsical and very
intend to of don't be hilarious if he
could play as the duck kind of you can
oh you can't yes he's one of the
characters really yeah and he's actually
pretty good okay at least I like him but
raring rot roaring roaring so his bird
his bird pal there then and then it goes
to show some some bits of gameplay and
show you
some of the new moves that banjo-kazooie
can can whip out I'm sure those will all
be exploited to their fullest by all the
pros in this game and there was also
okay just uses the bird as a weapon
yeah he just smacks him around like like
he's a bottle like a baseball bat so it
looks fun you know it's it's exciting
and they also announced and revealed the
hero which is from Dragon Quest I
believe the game I never really played I
don't have a link for that he just kind
of looks like one of the the Mii
characters he doesn't really look all
that interesting there are different
skins that you can put him in of course
from the different Dragon Quest games
but those are the two new characters
here oh and banjo kazooie from smash
ultimate cool hey I wish I had more time
to play this game if I had more time to
play games this is the one I would play
next step we have one more Nintendo
announcement so far which is breath of
the wild - this is a very brief teaser
kind of trailer it doesn't show any
gameplay of course it's just letting you
know that Nintendo is currently in
development with this game which is uh I
think it one game of the year didn't it
for 20 2017 or something like that I
it was definitely nominated don't know
chat will let us know in just a moment
but yeah breath of the wild was just a
phenomenal phenomenal II received game
through and through by all critics and
and the public and here it is a sequel a
sequel finally yay
everyone's gonna be super stoked on this
probably gonna be launching for that in
ten dose which some time in 2020 was
that red stuff was that the ether uh the
red stuff it could be could be ether is
that the breath of the wild ooh that is
just what the wild three thing I like
this trailer because it looks kind of
creepy like it actually kind of looks a
bit more like dark for a Zelda game yeah
like that felt was badass
I'm totally totally into it so yeah
thank you very much chat doesn't look
like anyone has seen if
was game of the year but it doesn't
matter it's gonna be coming soon very
fun I love the art style love it love it
love it love it thanks Finn Tendo
Bethesda showed off a trailer called
death loop for a game called death loop
death loop which looks very interesting
it's it looks like it kind of reminds me
of wasn't that I guess looper remember
the the movie looper with Bruce Willis I
think yeah I was kind of like time
travel there were like time loops
involved yeah kind of reminds me of that
too it to a certain degree I never
watched that but I've heard about it it
looks like a very interesting concept
where time travel is clearly a thing or
time loops I should say is a prevalent
concept and as this future self have to
go back in time to kill himself yes whoa
yes and no you have to go back in time
to kill the some other person who's also
trying to kill you like every time these
new people die they come back and try to
kill each other and get back in time to
apparently it save yourself apparently
it's the only way to break the cycle is
what they say in a cinematic trailer
it's all very mysterious still but it
looks like you've got these two very
unique kind of hyper exaggerated
assassins that each have their own
background their own story and they're
just trying to kill each other
throughout the whole thing and every
time they kill each other they come back
and they come back again and kill each
other again and come back again looks
very interesting and they get cool new
weapons each time oh yeah and and new
jackets you already had all the jackets
Oh melee - oh shit it's gonna be a
bloodbath so this looks really fun
can't wait to see the gameplay of course
I think the gameplay is really going to
determine whether it's something I'm
interested in
or not but it definitely has my
attention for now yeah looks good thanks
alright check out that loop and then
next up we have Tokyo ghost wire also
from Bethesda which looks very cool very
creepy this is a hyper-realistic
rendering of Tokyo Japan which I'm
already intrigued by oh I just love the
the setting I love Tokyo and stuff being
able to see this in a videogame with
these kinds of hyper realistic graphics
is exciting walking to the subway people
people are Japanese somebody's real
close together but they're on their
phones
yep they're so far apart yeah well they
are so close together it's so
metaphorical it's so deep and then all
of a sudden you kind of see that all
this is quiet sort of peaceful town is
all of a sudden just fucked up Oh
like a rapper yeah it's like it's like
the all the good Christians went up to
have so many Christians in Japan
poor poor high-heeled shoe or whatever
the whatever the correct religion is
yeah sure yeah
and then so like yeah poor dog poor pup
er didn't have anyone so it looks like
some shits afoot or are you right guys
it could have been thinness that could
have innocence yeah that was a snap that
was a snap event and look at these guys
look at their hands they're okay so this
is this is a this isn't nighthawk wait
what's wrong with their hands no go back
go back
the dudes yeah yeah see their hands oh
yeah super freaky hands oh why is it
this is just something like that could
be like I know scary because it looks so
human but so not and then you've got
these weird-ass dudes and like the
little what do you call those things but
what that's sculpture is the structures
those Japanese structures that one the
reassuring torii gate the torii gate
torii gates doing weird things this guy
looks super creepy
I mean it's typical Bethesda stuff where
it's just like man this looks haunting I
look in that ramen oh yeah ramen the
laptop it was a mouse that needs to be
upgraded this chicks is like oh geez
Thank You Nighthawk appreciated
Nighthawk this is what you've been doing
during Avengers and it's like I have no
idea what's going on I'm so intrigued
though yeah yeah it's it's got really
good had a really good response positive
response so far so ramen go ahead and
pre-order your ghost plan all right two
more here's we'll get through these
quickly Final Fantasy 7 remake Paul and
I were actually talking about length
earlier before the show went went alive
because Paul's actually played Final
Fantasy 7 so has his wife they both are
huge fans of this this installment of
the franchise
I've never played Final Fantasy 7 I
might've played
Final Fantasy 3 on gameboy advance but
the remake looks really cool it's gotten
me excited to actually give this game a
go I remember it just being talk of a
town when I was growing up and
PlayStation was recently PlayStation was
the new hot thing I'm I'm very much
looking forward to this cuz I've gone
back to like replay Final Fantasy 7 and
like it's very nostalgic but like the
graphics are so dated
yeah so dated right yeah like all our
did is get back into it it's it's such
an awesome story there's so many like
excellent elements that I'm sure they're
gonna be reusing and then just making
everything look beautiful right
alongside right so yeah like that was
materia she was holding up there that's
cloud with his Buster Sword it looks
like they've stayed pretty true to the
original yeah in terms of like settings
and characters yeah I think yeah I know
tifo was announced that was our Tifa was
unveiled she's a huge character from the
original and people went crazy and still
have Tifa in the game yeah they do have
keifa yeah yeah okay I'm sitting oh
you're saying that what but you hope no
I'm saying that they couldn't have
remade Final Fantasy without without TV
okay so she was a very prominent
character who the course incorporated
and cloud sword looks badass as ever she
is a diva yeah you can hear like the the
crowd screaming right wouldn't if it
comes on to come yet his daughter his
daughter and clouds an alcoholic plus
totally fine you know as I was Tifa so
they're fine they're on the same page
yeah was David that's at a bar where
they have yeah
underground meetings so just supporting
local businesses you know we're throwing
Shinra and stuff so very exciting stuff
here from who make Final Fantasy Simmons
Capcom no Square Enix thank you I'm very
exciting and then finally we have look
in Borderlands 3 we get to see some
gameplay in a news and a new trailer the
gameplay is a bit more interesting
because you can actually see how things
go
this is one of the the characters that
actually gets its own mech
I'm so I missed borderlands I'm gonna
play this - yeah we should play it
I was playing with you right when we
were at new agency if we play together
with like Rachel and much of other
people the four of us it was a great
co-op game
tons of fun spent a lot of hours in this
game it's just a great multiplayer
option so Stella says Matt and Berlin's
what what come on
SEL I have to say that the gameplay
itself looks like it looks very similar
to Borderlands 2 it doesn't look like
the gameplay itself has really changed
much I would have liked to see a bit
more difference I hope that they're just
holding cards closer to their chest and
that more is gonna be revealed in the
final product but but you know it's it's
still a new story it's a new okay a
slightly new world I suppose new levels
new bosses and that that still has my
attention but it's badass like I hope I
hope yeah I hope there's enough
different about it besides but that is
our brief III recap of what's been going
on so far and more more stuff to come
maybe by next week we'll have even more
III news for you once the event is
finally wrapped up but for now Paul's
half yay so stick around don't go
anywhere you can follow the link in my
description if you're watching on
youtube or stay where you are if you're
