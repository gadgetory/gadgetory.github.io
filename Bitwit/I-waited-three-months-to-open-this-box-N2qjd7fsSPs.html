it's raining in Southern California we
don't we don't get this kind of weather
often it's usually bright sunny skies
but we need it I guess we've been in a
drought for awhile and I don't mind the
rain because it comes so infrequently
here that it's kind of fun when it
happens you know forces you to sort of
run to your car instead of walk it's
good good exercise what am I getting at
here we're back the point is that we're
back we're back from Las Vegas back from
CES it's a brand new year 2019 whoo
brand new year same terrible dance from
wifey sauce some things some things
never change you know your New Year's
resolution should be learn how to dance
but then again your resolutions supposed
to be somewhat realistic right can't
can't be a can't be a moon shot ow that
that really stinks other resolution work
on your burn game burn Oh again let's be
realistic here okay so what was I gonna
do today oh wait you probably want to
see my face don't you probably not only
show it to you anyway so we're gonna do
a little bit of a vlog today because we
just unpacked all the stuff all of our
gear from CES here at the office but I
forgot the AC power cords for our LED
lights that we use for all of our stage
lighting and stuff so it would be
terrible lighting if I just tried to do
a regular video which is why we're gonna
blog today those are the lights of them
talking about they have no power cables
we can't use but that's okay we're still
gonna have a fun day hopefully you can
see here I've actually got some water
cooling hardware from ek this is their
vector RT X xx atti water block has
actually mounted onto an RT X xx atti
right now you guys remember I actually
did a video on the water block
installation a few weeks back this is
all for hot line ok hotline 2.0 we've
got the asus rog Maximus 11 formula and
we have to RTX 28 ET is that we're
putting together in NV link sli and
here's the other water block still in
the box I have not yet mounted this to
the other 20 abt I these are founders
edition 28 et eyes by the way and of
course we have a backplate this one will
have a backplate to look at the Z 390
chipset here I'm gonna be slotting in a
core I nine ninety nine hundred K from
Intel it's an 8 core 16 thread CPU
currently the fastest gaming chip on the
market because this is first and
foremost a gaming PC and all this will
be going inside of the fantex evolve X
mid tower case that's kind of
disassembled right now so why am I
telling you all this well that's because
we have this box here from ek that I
have been waiting to open for several
months now I initially
put in a request of the guise of D Cave
awesome team by the way over there about
three months ago October 15th I believe
is when I initially asked for all of
these parts everything to get the job
done for hotline 2.0 was about three
months ago so I waited for a week and
actually a week or so later this first
waterblock came in and that's why I did
the installation video way back then but
then nothing else really came after that
and I was waiting and waiting I waited
weeks and weeks and weeks and also very
busy along the way so kind of forgot
about at the same time till I finally
followed up with ek and they realized
that there was a shipping mishap with
DHL they were waiting on my response
which I had never given them and so this
whole package everything else was just
kind of waiting and shipping on someone
to respond so finally I did and then
this box finally came probably right
before Christmas but then of course
Christmas happened and the New Year's
happen and then CES and Las Vegas
happened and now here we are three
months later after initially requesting
this package to finally open it you guys
are gonna get to see the rest of the
water cooling hardware I will be using
four hot light 2.0 very excited so here
we go we're gonna open it right now on
camera I'm gonna do it one-handed and
I've actually kind of already forgotten
exactly what I requested because it's
been so long so this as much as a
surprise for me as it is for you cue
hardware porn groove music
so first off we've got the other act
plate good I was hoping that they
wouldn't forget this so we got the back
plate now for both water blocks so we
can cover all this nasty PCB business
look at this what is this ek cool stream
SC 360 so we've got a 360 rad then we
have another 360 rad but I believe this
is yes this is a cool stream PE so this
is actually quite a bit thicker let me
let me get a ruler really quick so the
PE which is the white box is about 60
millimeters and then the SE must be
around 50 maybe 45 or 50 millimeters
thick hope we got an extra back plates
so now we have three now I now I can
actually afford to screw one up and
break one and still have a backup so
that's good now the original hot line
had some funky bends if you recall so to
do it justice I'm gonna do some funky
bends this time around as well which
means I'm probably gonna mess up a lot
which is why I asked ek for a lot of
tubing and these are 12 millimeter inner
diameter and 16 millimeter outer
diameter so they are quite a bit thicker
than the tubes that were in the original
hot line fun we had a tube is this a
tube I believe it's a - yes it's a tube
204 millimeters tall this is our
reservoir tube for our pump press combo
this might be our pump Rask combo hey
ekx res 140 rivo d5 RGB PWM and cool ass
old pump black acetyl I'm calm down I
think this is like their flagship pump
res combo don't quote me on that but
it's got RGB it's got a d5 pump the
works unit pump bracket so we're gonna
be mounting this guy to this bracket and
then this bracket mounts on to a 120 mil
your fan I haven't decided which one
that's gonna be yet though look oh
please you never have too many fittings
we've got another velocity RGB block
here brand spankin new from ek but this
one's gonna be for our ninety nine
hundred K nickel an acetal construction
very classy and should do a really fine
job of carrying all that heat away from
our cpu I think those are all the custom
water cooling parts for this build it
was very exciting to see it all laid out
on the table however haphazardly it
might be but there's one more thing that
ek put in this box and not exactly sure
this might be a bag let me get this open
woods tricky trying to open this
one-handed with a razor without cutting
the
bang I think we've reached the boss
level it is a bag look at that it's got
like a full custom loop on and
everything that makes it the coolest bag
ever wait something's inside some things
inside that can only be one thing a
notebook is a water-cooled
thank you very much ek for providing all
this stuff we are so close now to
getting this build underway there are a
couple things though that need to happen
first before we get started no I don't
have them on hand right now they're
actually at home but n sourced customs
sleeps some beautiful cables for hotline
that I can't wait to see in the finish
bill as you can see from this b-roll
we've got some black some gray some pink
and now we've added teal to the mix or
turquoise or whatever you want to call
it just a slightly differentiate it from
hotline 1.0 and switch things up a bit
so what I'd like to do today is find
some spray paint that matches the teal
in the cables and go to town on this
here motherboard actually spray-painting
the reflective areas of the vrm water
block because you can see they're super
super shiny right now they look kind of
good but when you get up close they've
got scratches all over them and this is
this is basically from nothing at all
like this is this a microfiber cloth did
that I'm gonna leave this section alone
because there's actually LEDs here and
the real reason I want to spray-paint
these areas teal is because the coolant
in hotline 2.0 very much like the
original will be hot pink so I kind of
want to balance things out and not just
have everything hot pink and only have
teal represented in the cables
themselves I want teal to be another
accents in the system so I think having
them right here and here is a really
good place to start I also wanted to
kind of spray-paint this little area
this sort of the black trim just from
here all the way up to here I think
that's gonna be easy to mask off and
it'll also even out some of the teal
areas so it's not just in the top or
left side of the board but also a bit on
the right and then with a pink fluid
kind of moving around that I think it's
gonna look really really good I'm gonna
leave the lower half of the board alone
because once the graphics cards are
installed you won't be able to see this
area so much the focus will be primarily
on the graphics cards and the water
blocks whose LEDs we can configure the
color up to our liking that's what we're
doing today yeah shopping for paints
modifying motherboard probably eating
and some other random errands because
this is a vlog you guys know how this
goes
would you get pea soup Bunji Bunji is a
kanji or congee
it's kind of like a porridge right is it
for poor people all right I got the won
ton soup I'll would be proud you know
it's good when your neck disappears into
your body you notice how they didn't
once come over and ask us how everything
was Larry now why ask questions you know
the answers to right I am home now and I
wanted to show you guys the hot line 2.0
cables these are full length full-length
cables that'll be going into an EVGA I
think 1300 watt power supply I believe
it's the g2 I mean the camera doesn't
really do them justice joy from mentors
did a fantastic job put that hot pink
teal and gray black color scheme it just
looks so good
obviously this is the 24 pin ATX you got
two pairs of eight pin PCI Express
cables here's an 8 pin EPS 12-volt cable
for our CPU and an additional 4 pin
cable because our motherboard supports
extra overclocking just joy did a
fantastic job here really proud of him
and sourced has really become one of the
family in recent years as you can see
I'm gonna go run some errands with me Oh
what kind of work oh yeah I forgot about
that whole we just bought a new house
thing
ok well see you later bye now there are
a couple of hardware stores around my
house we've got Home Depot Lowe's a
couple local hardware stores as well but
because we're looking for a really weird
kind of oddball color like teal that's
something that you would ordinarily find
in a common household I think we're
better off finding something like that
at a hobby store or an arts and crafts
store or something like that and I think
I know just the place
Michaels of course of course it's
Michael's not just getting Hobby Lobby
you're going to Hobby Lobby
can you go get Bobby with his big old
knobby and take him to Hobby Lobby maybe
he can get a job what's for dinner corn
on the cob II Oh Michael I'm sorry this
is the hobby store she tells you not to
worry about there we go
spray paint we got here looks like teal
kinda right titled blue kinda like an
aqua there's waterfall as well there's
another aqua looks a little bit too
light and then we have surf which
huh it's kind of hard to tell
all right so after much internal
contemplation I settled on waterfall it
is pretty darn close and the lady who
worked at the store actually gave me a
fresh pair of eyes on it so I'm pretty
happy with this choice where all you
need one can because the surface area
that we're spray-painting is actually
very small on that motherboard I also
happen to grab gray because I'm still
debating this but I might actually
spray-paint the radiators or some other
accents in the system gray just like I
did with hotline 1.0 and as you can see
this should definitely match up nicely
as well man I didn't see a person under
the age of 85 in that store no joke they
could have all been is like bunch of my
grandpas and grandmas walking around
mostly grandmas Hobby Lobby if times
ever get rough you should think about
selling caskets I'm sure there's a lot
of old people looking to get into the
recreational sport of dying I'm looking
for a page that matches my skin tone my
corners asking I shouldn't be joking
about the old people they're very kind
and wise I'll be one of them someday so
so you know I should probably live it up
while I still can
Yolo and all that you know I'm gonna go
on a bender right now screw all my
responsibilities let's let's have some
fun
okay I guess we'll have our fun later in
the meantime I'm back home and while I
was gone wifey sauce so beautifully
mashed off all the areas for the
motherboard here and she did a great job
looks very very precise she also cleaned
all the surfaces prep them for painting
so we are good to give
well that is gonna do it for today it's
been a long day but a productive day and
the paint on the motherboard is actually
still drying I won't have time to show
it to you guys tomorrow morning because
we have to meet with a contractor at the
crack of dawn to replace all the
flooring in our new house it's this
whole ordeal so here's some b-roll that
I shot the morning after so you can kind
of see what the finished product looks
like you guys let me know what you think
if you have any comments concerns or
questions I'm hoping that it looks good
enough for an amateur model like myself
I'm sure you guys will let me know
either way but that's gonna do it for me
guys thank you so much for watching this
video if you enjoyed it and you like
what we do here on the pit wait toss a
like on the video before you go and get
subscribed for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon have a good one guys I
will see in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
