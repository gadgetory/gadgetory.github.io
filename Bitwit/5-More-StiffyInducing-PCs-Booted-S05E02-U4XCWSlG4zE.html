start the music hello welcome
I totally butchered that intro I was
supposed to start on the graphic not my
face and then I realized I'd been made
out so screw it
who cares about intros anyway what's
what's up guys welcome back to booted
this is episode 2 of season 5 and I'm
just gonna come right out and say it if
you guys have already seen my channel
update then you're already aware of this
if you haven't well you might you may or
may not care or be disappointed
or glad who knows that this will be the
last season of booted for the
foreseeable future um I decided about a
month or two ago that this is going to
be the last season just because I don't
want to really sacrifice any quality on
my regular content for this here live
stream and as much as I love doing the
show I really do I really enjoy it it's
just a fun super fun way to connect with
you guys and show off some awesome pcs
that you guys submit as much as it's
much fun as I have doing this I still
have to look out for my regular content
and I saw a slight slippage of quality
in the last few months in in that in
those types of videos since doing booted
so if you guys want more details on why
this is the last season stuff I've
uploaded a channel update video and you
can go watch all the details listen to
me ramble on about that and other things
some other important channel updates
there as well but I'm not here to talk
about that today today we are doing the
damn show as far as I'm concerned it's
not over until the fat lady sings
and I haven't sung yet so with that in
mind I'm going to go ahead and press on
forward we're going to talk about what
happened last week briefly because there
was a bit of controversy in the elected
week one finalist who was Brad now I'm
going to remind you guys of his system
beautiful beautiful system but once it
was revealed that Brad had been voted as
the
week one finalist last week a bunch of
people in chat were saying that no no I
don't know if this is a legitimate
submission because I've seen pictures of
this exact system on a form I believe it
was overclocked 3-d or overclocked net I
can't remember exactly which one it was
a popular forum people had seen these
exact pictures and they were linking
linking this in chat these photos and I
thought ooh this could very well be a
fraudulent entry so I contacted Brad and
I asked him to send me some pictures of
this system and I give him some weird
you know things I said all right I want
you to have a sign that says awesome
sauce on it and I also want you know
have the date and leave one of the PCIe
cables unplugged because I felt like
that was if he was if he was a scumbag
and he was gonna try to Photoshop
something that would be a lot more
difficult to photoshop something like
that so he did I mean he he did the
whole nine yards he submitted it he was
in the photo leaning on top of the the
system it I even uh yeah I got a second
opinion from one of the mods and checked
out on both of our ends so because of
that Brad is now officially the week one
finalist of this season he really does
as it seems right now it seems like he
is the rightful owner of this rig and
it's very possible that someone could
have someone's that's going to build a
machine of this caliber is going to be
involved in forums and wanting to share
their system obviously if he was
thinking about submitting his his rig to
booted it makes sense that he's shared
it with other people online in the past
so congrats to Brad for actually owning
this PC it's a beautiful work of art
just another side look here just
absolutely stellar so just wanted to
clarify all of that so that's all
cleared up yes I was going to give a
shout out I forget his name but the
runner-up who had the like the neon
green and purple system who got second
place last week shout-out to YouTube and
because that was a really killer system
and you would have been the week one
finalist had
Brad not actually been legitimate with
his entry so on that note we can go
ahead and move on to our next five
contestants of this season these are the
second way this is the second wave of
liquid-cooled pcs this is the
water-cooled addition of booted first
and only one sadly however it's been
really exciting so far we've seen a lot
of crazy stuff and it's going to
continue with gyro hi ro hi hero I I
just don't know so I apologize if I'm
butchering your name but you've got a
pretty killer system here fractal design
define s one of the one of my personal
favorites you guys haven't been able to
tell until core i7 5820k msi x99s sli
creaked edition motherboard corsair
dominator Platinum's 16 gigs and we've
got a gtx 980ti some Samsung Evo SSDs in
there and for water cooling you can see
he's got some beautiful white radiators
here that are excess PC the race storm
CPU block also from excess PC and excess
PC GPU block as well
alpha cool for the pump yes this is
pretty sexy so obviously you can see
he's gone with the black and white
themed rake here the bends in this this
rig are very simple from what I can tell
there's nothing crazy going on it's it's
very minimal but the the bends look good
they're relatively straight sure if you
put a level on them they'd be more or
less more or less flat across the board
and I'm really digging that water block
actually and I kind of like how the
water block the little slivers of copper
match the copper block on the GPU I just
kind of like how those two those two
things match it's just it looks good
looks good my opinion I've got some
white fluid in there as well
this is Mayhem's pesto see a lot of
Mayhem's pesto in this season seems to
be a very popular
you've trained your cables quite nicely
as well they look very very clean uh you
know there's no overlapping they've um
they've definitely been been trained
well you've taken them too many a cable
daycare session I don't know I don't
know what I'm saying anymore this is a
shot with the LEDs on and also the the
image that I happen to choose for this
episode's thumbnail the video thumbnail
this is it um because it just looks
freakin sweet I just I didn't even
realize that that waterblock lights up
that excess PC block lights the eff up
with them LEDs and it just really draws
your eyes to that region of the case and
yeah just looks just looks great like in
those bits power fittings as well again
very clean very simple it's not too
extravagant
gets the job done it's classy it's a
classy system here you got gyro gyro I
don't know all right let's move on to
eat it yeah now Ian may very well win
the Internet with this rig of his
because uh it's a portal themed system
and it's uh it's probably one of the
best portal themed computers I've ever
seen it's just absolutely spectacular so
and he's even got the figurines you know
stand nearby I think we're wearing the
same headphones those look like same
exact k7 xx's a kgs shout-out to you on
that
nice nice taste but what a great case
also to pick for a portal theme Drake
the fan takes enthu primo I mean it
looks like it was straight-up made in a
lab and aperture laboratories and just
all the decals that you have here are
just freaking dope as someone in chat
said dope sauce super dope sauce and I
love the colors as well I mean this is
classic you know portal the portal BOTS
Peabody and
get the other guy's name but you know
look at them look at them Ben's too so
the colors here are just absolutely
beautiful I mean you've got that little
bit of that orange and blue that
represent the the robots but then the
rest of its just clean and sterile like
a lab and it's just I really really like
how you left the ATX 24-pin cables and
the PCIe cables black and white I'm glad
you didn't go extreme with like more
orange and more blue because it's enough
those bends are so long and there's you
know they're just kind of all over the
place that you didn't really need to
like paint it up anymore with with more
color so I think you just did it really
it was a really good choice on your end
great choice of chassis as well as I
mentioned and I love the bends in these
runs I mean these runs are super long
and I just I love the blue Bend coming
out from your your CPU block going down
to like where the power supply shroud is
I love how it kind of just edges around
the GPUs and then it tucks back in a
little bit you know kind of curves back
in it's just a really subtle angled Bend
but it just there's and there's a couple
of them here and it just looks really
really clean man really nice work these
are gtx 980ti s you know it's a good
system when we're not even talking about
the actual like components really it's
more about just like the the Meisel and
sin of this system it's just really
really well done 32 gigs of HyperX fury
ram ddr4 and 5820k I think I might have
mentioned that I don't know until 750
series 400 gig SSD yes yes look at the
back plates ah the soap beaut well
wifey sauce really likes the system she
she likes portal a lot she was playing
it not too long ago with her
brother-in-law the other day so she saw
this and she's just like wow it really
is one of those systems just makes you
go wow look at the sli bridge bro look
at the sli bridge that's an EVGA sli
bridge but he's gone ahead and modified
it to actually have a light up aperture
logo what even is attention to detail I
thought I knew what it was
I don't clearly very very nice
yep decal on the motherboard as well
thanks for pointing that out
just everything everything so money it's
so money yeah and uh white LEDs as you
can see in this picture of course be
really disappointed if they were like
green I mean weird right um just
look at that really well illuminated
nice and even lighting all around at
least from what I can tell in this
picture and you get that really nice
case accent lighting as well on the
Primo freaking fantastic man
well done everyone's gonna have a tough
time winning the audience's heart and
portals portals just got such a huge
huge fan following huge fan base alright
but this this this PC is no slouch by
any means
this is Chris's system and he's wrecking
a a Corsair 750d and he's got there's a
lot going on here but in a good way he's
got um two gtx 980ti s2a sli 64 gigs of
tried NZ ddr4 at 3000 I haven't seen
this much tried NZ since the g-scale
booth at Computex that's a crap ton
freaking memory 64 gigs and I really
like the carbon fibre job that you've
done here on the five and a quarter inch
bay and with that big MSI logo it just
looks really professionally done I don't
see like any frayed edges it looks
completely straight on both the edges
and it's a fatty case badge as well just
looks really nice and it also looks like
you don't really have any bends in this
system it looks like it's all just a
straight straight tubing you're using
some Mayhem's glass piping so straight
tubing all around no bends and you're
just kind of using these chrome fittings
to kind of connect all the tubes
together which I like the way you've
done it
granted it's probably could've couldn't
have been cheap to buy all those
fittings
probably cost more than some people's
systems somewhere somewhere out there
someone has a system that's cheaper than
the cost of these fittings but I digress
also really really nice choice of the
waterblock I really like that supremacy
Evo the transparent one where you can
see the the red fluid flowing through
kind of nice just how you've got a lot
of airflow going through here as well to
intake fans at the front you've got two
more at the bottom of the case and
you've got a 360 rad it's an ek
slipstream I believe cool stream sorry
cool stream radiator those are the
slimmer ones got that at the top of 360
at the top 240 at the front and just a
lot of good air flow coming through this
case looks like you have like all pretty
much like neutral air pressure because
even put the same number of fans going
in and out cable sleeping looks right on
the money as well right on it super
sharp bro I think you have one more
picture here oh yeah I'm not exactly
sure what happened with this photo I
can't tell if if that's the camera doing
this weird artifacting this weird
blurring at the bottom or or if you did
something to your backplate it's
interesting you've got a msi branded
backplate there too do you work for him
aside Chris since in since the little
sponsorship brand dealio here I don't
know but I'm not sure exactly what's
happening with this picture someone
knows what's happening with this
waterblock that on the GPU please inform
me am I missing something
overall very nice rig Chris we are next
up we've got Anthony and Tony and we
don't see too many of these on booted
but this is a micro ATX build in the
fractal design node 804 very nice
chassis it's kind of a compartmentalized
kind of like the Corsair air 240 or air
540 I believe this is the case that Paul
uses Paul's hardware for his mass or as
HTTP sea at home which seems to be
having a good time with that core i7
5820k a lot of xi9 builds here of course
on the EVGA x99 micro to mother
word very nice kind of color neutral
board very color neutral system you've
got a lot of just black and gray light
gray but I really like it it just looks
really when you have it when you have a
just a very neutral color palette it's
just completely timeless I feel like
you'll never get sick of it and you've
got 16 gigs of Crucial Ballistix elite
memory in there as well I really love
how fat how you've just really taken up
all the length that the case has to fit
that reservoir in there that ek uh but
ek rez it just looks like oh I just love
seeing things filled out
I love seeing cases being completely
used to their max max capacity from a
real estate point of view and you've got
a nice radiator at the front there 240 I
believe those are alpha cool Nexus S 2
st 30s got a 240 there and a 240
millimeter on the other side of the case
I believe take a look at that really
like even though this is soft tubing I
believe yeah its soft tubing the bends
are really short because you're dealing
in this dealing with a smaller chassis
so they don't look all drooping stuff
they're like tight they're like tightly
tightly done it's not too much excess
tubing going around looks very nice and
I think you just did a perfect job with
the cables there as far as the colors go
the black the gray and then the light
gray just kind of creates this really
nice gradient that that really just
suits the rest of your build nice nice
nice nice money shot mono shot can't
tell if the the fluid looks a little
cloudy or if that's how it's supposed to
look
it's Mayhem's UV clear blue kind of
looks like there's semen in it or
something but it could just be me might
just be the photo I what do I know about
semen water and they've got a little
sneak peak here of your SSD just peaking
through this is obviously the other side
of the chassis
we've got you know your power supply and
you can see the pump right there and
Samsung
the Evo just chillin and if we take a
look at the other last picture here you
can see it's not really the best kind of
a shot here but um can see that there
are some UV LEDs darkside UV LEDs to
illuminate the whole thing so that makes
sense with the UV coolant that kind of
just gives the case a little bit more of
a personality at night which I kind of
like I really like like kind of
transformative builds that look
different during the day than they do at
night I think that's pretty cool um
alright and let's talk about our final
contestant who is again Rafa Rafa Rafa
whatever it is you have a pretty killer
system here buddy this is a carbide air
540 from Corsair 59 30k an Asus Rampage
5 extreme motherboard 32 gigs of g.skill
ripjaws for ddr4 two gtx 980ti s
in sli 480 gig Intel 730 series SSD and
you got an NZXT hupe loose in there
purple themed I like purple it's
different it's not red green or blue or
white it's just a little bit more unique
I'm starting to see more purple builds
and kind of pinkish builds as well
wonder wonder where people get getting
their inspiration for pink builds these
days but um this this purple system is
really nice and the first thing I
thought was while the purple in the
pastel coolant that you have is not
really the same shade of purple in your
cables because that's like purple purple
and you're in your sleeping but then
it's more like a lavender color in your
in your tubes but then I thought you
know it kind of works because in your
cable sleeping you don't just have that
really rich purple you also have kind of
like two shades of grey and there I felt
like those colors kind of combined like
my brain just kind of creates an average
of those three colors which is the
lavender that I see in your tubing
so it sort of balances out I don't know
does that make any sense
do you guys maybe I'm just being crazy
right now
but I like the tube ending is well very
very different get some very simple
bends at the the lower half of the of
the system and you get this kind of a
fun whimsical Bend that goes from your
CPU water block and it just goes through
kind of like slips over to the left side
of the case and then it goes to the
right all the way across and then up to
your radiator at the top there which is
an equal EK cool stream pe - fuh - 360
I'm sorry - 40 - 40 at the top 360 at
the front so I know I know exactly why
you did the bend that way that long vent
same reason why I did a hot line the way
I did for also the same been going from
the CP water block to the one of the
radiators actually that that one goes to
the front and hot line but I think it
you just did it to kind of create more
balance in the system instead of just
going straight up from the water block
and over that kind of would have left
the upper left quadrant of your system
looking a little bit bare and it there
wouldn't be much color there just be
like oh what's over here this this this
section this corner of the system
ashmore Ram cares about ram so I think
you've done a nice job balancing things
out adding more color to the to the
overall picture here and let's take a
look at the money shot there is one yes
I believe and got an SLI a hard Ridge
rigid sli bridge there now here's here's
my one critique if I had one on this
system is that there are some red
accents on your motherboard that kind of
just don't have a place in the for the
rest of your the color palette here
doesn't really match with purple my
opinion so that that kind of just looks
a little jarring to me and granted from
like the side angle if we look again you
can't really see too much red here other
than maybe like the surface mounted
power button on the motherboard and you
know maybe some stuff behind the video
cards but other than that it looks it
looks pretty good it's only when you get
like an angle shot like this where you
really see
yeah ROG branding and stuff and here's a
cat be cool if that was purple that was
somehow modifiable but I don't know if
it is but that would be my one my one
little little small gripe other than
that very good attention to detail here
you've also painted the the PCI slots as
well as the fan grill on the back your
system which you just nailed it right on
the head I mean it's the exact same
shade of of lavender as we see in in the
tubes so good on you mate for that one
and then and then here we get some LED
action alright so I can't tell if it's
just a picture doing this but it lit
what kind of pink the LEDs look pink
they could very well be purple and I'm
just getting thrown off by the sensor in
the camera um but it looks pretty man it
looks really really nice with the LEDs
on I think I actually like it look I
like the way it looks better with the
LEDs on just really um I don't know I
think it's just how it reflects on those
radiators maybe just add so much more
color to the to the overall system but
um yeah that's a lot to say about that
Rafa so thank you for sending those in
all everyone who participated in this
particular episode of booted thank you
you're all very brave because it's it's
not an easy competition this season it's
very very highly competitive and next
episode next week we're going to see
some even crazier or just as crazy
systems which are reserving for that for
that special special time but um I think
right about now we should go ahead and
vote on which of these pcs should move
on to the final round so right about now
you'll be seeing in chat my lovely
moderators Matt a geek spider fan and my
wife of course hopefully at least one of
them will post a link in chat right
about now and tell you to go vote go
vote on which system you thought was the
best because um that's what we're about
to do and in the meantime while you guys
are getting that situated and thinking
really hard about which system deserves
to go on to the final round
I'm going to make a quick announcement
which is about like giveaway I I built
the gaming PC yay me
I built the gaming PC last month few
weeks ago and in the dark bass 900 dark
bass pro 904 be quiet amazing case and a
lot of you guys already know this but
I'm giving it away and the giveaway
which just go find find it on my channel

earlier I have not been keeping a good
enough eye on Chet but now is the time
to take a look at our next finalist for
season 5 the last season of this
particular series I'm going to go ahead
and crank up the voting music and we're
gonna go ahead and switch over to this
page
all right so we've got gyro Anthony Ian
Brian and Chris so many good options but
only one unfortunately can move on to
the final round at the end of this month
so who's it gonna be guys who's it gonna
be who's it gonna be
whoo all right let's take a look let's
take a look here right yeah large this
for ya all right here we go refresh and
the winner is Ian with 52% of the vote
holy moly
good lord that's one of the largest
landslides I think we've seen in the
series so far
53% 193 votes good Lord with um gyro
coming in a far bit no I'm sorry Chris
coming in a far behind second at 16% and
gyro in third following closely behind
Chris but holy smokes
yeah I'm not I'm not too surprised here
guys that Ian kind of swept the floor
with the rest of the competition with
his portal system it's just yeah it's
gonna be tough to beat this one guys
it's gonna be tough so right now just to
recap we've got Ian with his portal rig
going up against Brad again just an
incredible piece of work here both both
rigs really have a very good chance of
winning this contest so um and you guys
can't give Brad any hard time like you
can't be biased that there was some kind
of toss up you know last week I just
want to make that clear
I don't want anyone to dock Brad points
because he may or may not have been the
legitimate winner last week he's proven
it he's wiped his his record clean he
should be treated like any other
contestant but man it's going to be
tough between uh Brad and Ian guys so uh
well Jeff will set the
see who the next finalist is for booted
when we return one week from today but
that is pretty much gonna do it guys I
don't think I have anything else to
announce or update you on um pick up a
shirt from the awesomesauce store if you
like shirts some of them some of which
are out of stock but some of them are
not out of stock and you can buy them
and stuff and support channel whatever
