dude it's too noisy I can't sleep do I
at least get a bedtime story fine
once upon a time there was a tiny little
boy who couldn't fall asleep loud noises
scared him and made him wet the bed
everyone goes to their own pace doc
anyway one day the little boy found a
magical case called the defined T by
fractal design impressed by the
minimalistic Scandinavian design he
hopped decide to investigate the
interior the case was rooming without
being too big offering plenty of room
for him to frolic and play the little
boy was amazed from full-length psuche
wrapped an ample korean airport and then
he saw whole walls pour all of the
liquid Kalonji
the best part was a large side panel
window so he didn't have to be afraid of
the dark a little boy built happily ever
after the case your dreams is finally
here click the link in the description
to learn more about the defined see from
fractal design
okay hmm hmm good morning

you with that once the last time we went
to Universal Studios are you kidding me
that's one of the first places we want
we were dating we were only my parents I
think those Universal Studios because I
remember getting a thing 1 and thing 2
sweaters over there I'm sure it's
changed a lot since what seven years ago
and it's a beautiful day out it's so
sunny since these are already ripped it
doesn't matter if I rip them more it
doesn't matter well why though I would
just be contributing to the style they
actually are sensation so there's
there's a certain amount of ripping
that's appropriate and then it becomes
too much further further proves that I
understand nothing about throw toucher
strikes again
we're actually here we're doing it I
think we go on the Matterhorn first
