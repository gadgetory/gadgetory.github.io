the description for more info all right
John at the end when booth now we're
actually on the in the man gang area
this is the main convention center of
combi Tex the heart and soul if you will
so yeah like I said I met you in when
they have some really cool stuff here
some of which we've already seen at CES
I'm going to kind of condense it down
for you but what really caught my eye
was this this is the D frame 2.0 many of
you guys are already familiar with the D
frame one point out the original which
is kind of known for being like an
open-air type design but you can see
here we've kind of got the same steel
welded material super sturdy it's also
got the very nice tempered glass side
panel there so you can see all of your
innards quite easily looks very
beautiful actually a lot of good water
cooling support as well I've got a 360
radiator here at the bottom and they've
actually managed to squeeze a 240 there
at the front of the case as well they've
also got built-in reservoir support here
at the front of the case you can see
we've got two graphics cards that are
also water-cooled this is just a fully
water-cooled system here we've got 8 PCI
slots you actually have the your rear
i/o for your motherboard sticks out of
the top as well so you want to keep that
in mind now this is not for the faint of
heart you're going to be spending about
$1,500 for the case as well as the
included power supply which is
proprietary towards before before the
chassis pretty nice little case here
however if you guys are interested in
something a little bit more feasible in
terms of financial budgetary means I
actually have just the case for you so
let's go let's go check it out so here
we have the in wind 303 this actually is
a really cool case when and Ephrem in
win actually asked me first how much I
thought this case would be MSRP I said
160 bucks
turns out it's only an 89 $99 case which
is amazing for everything you get here
you've got illuminated front panel which
looks really nice you've also got a full
tempered glass side panel with a latch
for easy removal and replacement which
is pretty awesome
it also features custom water cooling so
you've got a 360 millimeter radiator at
the bottom and you've got even some fan
mounts at the at the top of the case
which are actually kind of in this
vertical scenario which exhaust air
towards the back panel which is pretty
cool so stay tuned for that it's going
to be 89 90
again it's gonna be launching sometime
next week by the way guys my Computex
