channel hope you're all doing well so
about eight months ago I started using
the predator x34 monitor from Acer as my
daily driver when it first launched in
late 2015 it was touted by many as the
holy grail of gaming panels for having
all the latest specs and technologies
with little left to be desired a curved
ultra wide IPS display a 34 40 by 1440
resolution and gsync support up to a
hundred Hertz to name a few and while I
still stand by most of the opinions
expressed in my initial review using the
panel extensively for a prolonged period
of time has revealed to me several
qualities that have tainted my overall
experience with this otherwise revered
monitor so today we'll be identifying
five things I hate about the predator
x34 now there's no denying that the
panel stylized design can steal the show
from even the most glamorous rig sitting
beside it but if there's anything that
can detract from the x34 s aggressive
stance ironically it's the massive
triangular base that sports the wingspan
of a wandering albatross upon my
modestly sized desk accidentally running
my mouse into one of the protruding base
legs has become a source of constant
irritation whether it's slightly
snagging the braided cable or touching
hardened tips this is the only monitor
I've owned that interferes with my daily
mousing it's hard to fault acer here
since a wider base seems like a
necessary evil for an ultra wide display
so this critique along with some others
on this list perhaps are aimed at 21 by
9 screens in general you could also
argue that I've simply paired too small
a desk with two larger panels but bear
in mind plenty of users prefer to have
their monitors up close and personal
regardless of their desk size especially
to enhance the wraparound immersion
that's offered by ultra wide screens in
which case they too may find the x34
base to be obnoxiously wide
despite its charming good looks I was
going to add the outrageous price tag as
the next item of scrutiny to our list
here before feeling like it would be
sort of a cop-out so instead let me just
say that a monitor costing well over
$1,000 should include some degree of
swivel adjustment which the x34 does not
sure you get heightened tilt but over
the years I've grown dependent on my
beloved swivel for a number of time
like sharing the screen with others or
to quickly access the back of my panel
and this goes double for a large heavy
monitor that doesn't move easy call me
lazy butt for $1,100 I have a friggin
right to be at this point a third party
stand or vase alarm seems like a perfect
solution assuming you don't mind pouring
even more money into your pricey panel
enough about the basin stand though
there's so much more to hate about this
monitor take its external power brick
for example I will say off the bat that
add-on power supplies are typically
cheaper and easier to replace than
on-board units should they fail but
that's where their convenience ends for
me
for starters tidy cable routing is often
more difficult when objects other than
cables are involved a large brick is
harder to hide and doesn't fit behind
your desk quite as easily I had to pull
my desk out a few inches from the wall
just to conceal the monolithic tumor
from public view there's also an
additional connection that can fail or
come unplugged with such power supplies
perhaps worst of all particularly for
someone like me who moves hardware
around constantly is that the power
cable has to follow the monitor
everywhere it goes since you can't use a
standard AC power cord it'd be great if
I could just pull a spare AC cable from
my spare AC table drawer but no instead
I'm left to fishing out a brick from
behind a desk which for most of us is a
pain in the neck all too familiar
the next caveat may sound especially
silly because it's also one of the top
selling points of this product but it
goes without saying that an ultra wide
monitor takes up an ultra-wide amount of
space on your desk potentially leaving
little to no room for much else again
this is partially me suffering from
undersized desk syndrome but over time
I've learned ultra wives incorporate
their own special brand of bulkiness a
dual monitor setup for example at least
offers the flexibility to pivot and
arrange the panel's independently in
order to optimize desk space a luxury I
always took for granted until adopting a
sirs beastly display having a 34 inch
ultra wide is also why my left speaker
sits behind the gargantuan panel which
makes my heart go out to my left ear and
it's infinite loneliness the biggest
disappointment however is that such a
monitor ruins any chance for me or other
small desk users of having a secondary
display a common misconception here is
that there's hardly a need for a
companion monitor when you have a 21 by
9 panel which leads us to our last
quibble
here that a single ultrawide monitor in
my opinion is far less convenient than a
dual panel setup for productivity tasks
like editing and streaming don't get me
wrong for gaming in full-screen mode
ultra wide is currently as good as it
gets but the elongated aspect ratio
makes the screen feel vertically
challenged when working in a program
like Adobe Premiere Pro - note one
example the joy of being able to see 35%
more of my project timeline at any given
moment is sadly overshadowed by having
less room for vertically expanding my
video and audio tracks as it turns out
ultra wide is just a more positive way
of saying ultra short having dual
monitors for streaming is also a setup
I missed terribly things were simple
back then I'd have my game running in
borderless windowed mode on one display
with xsplit twitch ad and the like on
the other having two displays offered a
natural partition that helped organize
my windows when multitasking streaming
on the predator x34 however brings too
many windows to one screen and I
definitely spend a lot more time
resizing them to make everything fit
properly those are valuable seconds that
I'll never get back and for that I hate
UX 34 I hate you so much by now you guys
are probably wondering why I'm still
using this display at all it seems I'd
be better off throwing it down a well or
giving it away to one of you I'd imagine
but despite me tearing it a new one the
ex 34 has countless redeeming qualities
that I've detailed in my review and
still remains in my eyes one of the best
gaming monitors currently on the market
plus it looks great in the background on
my videos
can't complain there when I move into my
new studio office in August however the
ex 34 will retire its position as my
daily driver and will most likely be
used exclusively for gaming which is of
course what its best at that's all for
now guys let me know in the comments
