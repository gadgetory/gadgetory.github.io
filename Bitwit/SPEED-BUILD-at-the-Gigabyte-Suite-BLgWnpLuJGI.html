brought to you by fantex verdaguer enter
max be quiet and cable mod you can learn
more about their products in the links
below
what's going on guys Kyle Ted wood here
I am currently at the gigabyte Suites at
Computex 2018 where they've invited me
here to actually do a full-blown system
build as a speed challenge so I'm gonna
be building a full-blown system today as
fast as I possibly can
we have a whole list of pretty nice
hardware that is from gigabytes / Horus
themselves
now we're gonna be taking a closer look
at today as I go about the bill so is my
timer ready alright finger on the clock
let's start it in three two one go go
that's a time penalty give me the CPU
CPU another board alright so this is a
not a gigabyte CPU it's a gigabyte
branded case that happens to have an
Intel Core i7 86 hundred K processor
inside of it with a very nice Z 370 or s
gaming seven motherboard and I'm I'm
assuming that all of the time that I'm
that I spend showing retail boxes to the
camera will be deducted from my final
score wifey sauce is gonna do a great
job of removing all of the packaging
from the table as as it as it lands CPU
installed memory memory let's see that
memory this is really a speed challenge
for wifey sauce just as much as it is
for me look at this weight gigabyte
makes gigabyte makes memory I believe
these are their new or s ddr4 RGB kit
modules these are really really nice I'm
getting so distracted right now I should
be focused on the build but I just can't
help myself these are so nice okay so it
looks like two of these are full-blown
sticks and two of them are actually
dummy sticks but they still have the
LEDs on them that are
syncable through RGB fusion and whatnot
I guess this is to provide the illusion
that you've spent a lot more on your
system than you actually have
let's face it it's all about how the rig
looks these days however that doesn't
mean that these real dims are any slouch
there's still 3,200 speed Samsung D dies
super high quality cast 16 and memory is
installed alright next we need cooler
another orange product or snakes coolers
now what is happening I don't understand
this is the ATC 700 or a CPU cooler air
tower from the looks of it so we've got
Wow look at those heat pipes holy moly I
don't think I've ever seen such massive
heat pipes on an air cooler my god where
are those eight eight millimeter ten
millimeter I don't know but there's a be
fair all right and we've got some
packaging here look at that that top
cover so we do have some RGB lighting I
believe on the top all right I need to
consult the manual you in the manual
fooled oh good
lots of good helpful pictures in the
instruction manual which is very useful
for me because I can't read all right
let's put this back on so there's
essentially two brackets that you use
for for the intel mounting solution this
one actually goes on top of the
motherboard and it mounts through the
sides here screwdriver oh they gave me a
non-magnetic tip screwdriver those
cheeky bastards I swear they're they're
trying to sabotage me look at that it's
already working this is the thanks I get
for doing a video unbelievable I totally
got this I'm a professional and in that
goes all right other side and these are
always tricky these little these little
flat brackets that go on the sides you
have to make sure that you mount them
just right
wifey sauce there's a tiny screwdriver
in my Canon backpack over there thank
you ten minutes no sweat
even though I am sweating at the moment
I had a feeling that if they gave me a
air cooler that it would definitely be
the thing that takes me the longest I
feel like after this we should be smooth
sailing now that that's done we can
basically mount this onto the CPU okay
we have a washer and then the screws and
then we tighten it but first thermal
paste I like I like the P the P method
or grain of rice method assuming that it
comes out haha look at that beautiful
and and if you're really if you're
really talented
the turd method is also a great
application technique and I almost
forgot the washers are there any more
washers in there there are no more
washers according to wifey sauce which
means I'm just gonna raw dog it without
the washers and hope it doesn't cause
any issues it also looks like I might
have to remove these fans no it doesn't
it doesn't say I have to maybe I can
just man um I like this how's this hold
on wait a second did I know I amounted
these without needing to so I'm gonna
these are for AMD oh I screwed up I'm
guessing that someone's used this exact
cooler before and perhaps didn't put all
the accessories in the right bags so
down we go shut up
is that our sort of unofficial goal is
to try to do this build in under 30
minutes I think that's fair this may not
clear
so just for clearance purposes I'm just
gonna mount these two sticks for now but
that's fine we're still gonna get full
performance because these are just
dummies no offense dummies all right
look at that beautiful next case this is
the AC 300w mid tower case you get a
nice panel it is acrylic however it does
allow you to see all of your internal
components very nicely stand-ups are
pre-installed which I appreciate I
haven't worked with this case before but
you do get a power supply shroud nice
dust filter at the top some radiator
mounting points looks like you could fit
a 360 at the front that's actually
pretty nice in we go would be very
gentle treat it like a lady a gigabyte
power supply I mean I know that gigabyte
makes plenty of amazing power supplies
but this is one that I have not seen
before be six-fifty be 80 plus bronze
certified we just finished screwing
these in and I've got to work
double-time right now oh this screws
gonna be tough without a magnetic
screwdriver luckily this little one is
magnetic but it's very weak so I have to
like carefully lower it but now it's too
short I can't have to reach okay 24
minutes are you changing the time you
put that away I totally got this man
alright so not modular but that's okay
we do have a power supply basement in
this case so we can stash any excess
cables we need to mount this guy behind
the motherboard tray I only see two
screws here for my power supply so I'm
just gonna leave these two screws in for
now Oh eight pin Oh 8 pin don't fail me
now fortunately this power supply has
the type of eight pin connector that
latches the two four pins together so
that you have an easier time connecting
it in a very tight
space their gigabyte SSD 512 gig I
believe this is using Toshiba TLC NAND
okay looks like we've got some SSD trays
wifey you're gonna need to get me a SATA
cable and screws I need screws ooh a gtx
980ti from Oris I've been told that I
can keep this after I'm done with it oh
thank god the expansion slots have
already been removed by someone oh but I
still need to remove the two screws
holding this in place yeah there's a
screw and this power supply thankfully
has two six plus two connectors for your
GPU so even a high end GPU shouldn't
have any problem getting powered by this
this unit look at that no screws oh my
gosh well I can't mount the SSD without
screws honey well we're just gonna have
to improvise oh my gosh you've got to be
kidding me no problem no problem okay
come on come on come on you got this
just shove it all in I'm done I'm done
I'm totally done yes I am to one it's
done man
look it's perfect it's in perfect shape
I would I would sell this to anyone
thirty minutes and three seconds and and
if I had if I had just 30 more seconds I
probably could have made it absolutely
perfect in every way but hey you know
what let's do the ultimate test to see
if I actually pulled this off with a
boot test I do have a screwdriver
because I didn't get around to plugging
in front panel connectors that doesn't
matter shut up okay I saw some LEDs
turning on as soon as I turn on the
power supply so that's good
let's see if it boots
now I have to level with you guys I am
fairly confident that I did not plug in
the rear fan so yeah the graphics card
fans are spinning the CPU cooler fans
are spinning the LEDs on the RAM is lit
AF fan and it is essentially booting the
motherboard is also lit up the only
thing that really isn't functional right
now is this rear exhaust fan which you
know has a molex connector so that
probably would've taken me an hour to to
plug in anyway
and for the record I even had time to
plug in these amazing Horus peripherals
we have the Auris k9 optical which
features flare tech switches and the
Auris m5 gaming mouse alright so guys
this just proves that I am a PC building
master ignoring the front panel
connectors in the fan but guys thank you
so much for tuning in and thank you
wifey sauce for being annoying this
entire video but also for being lovely
and handing me the parts and timing
things and and just being overall
awesome and thank you guys for joining
me for this video appreciate it go ahead
and check out any of the links down
below where you can check out all this
amazing gigabyte hardware that's either
out now or coming very soon to a store
or retailer near you but yeah go ahead
and follow me subscribe toss like on the
video if you enjoyed it and stay tuned
for more Computex coverage here in
Taipei for 2018
