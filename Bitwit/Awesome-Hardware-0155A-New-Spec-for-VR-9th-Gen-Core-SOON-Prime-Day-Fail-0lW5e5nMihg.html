YouTube yes
no yeah first me that's accurate then
hello everyone welcome back to awesome
hardware the tech news show the Paul and
I do every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time I like to have a few drinks
on the show so if you're of legal
drinking age feel free to join us drink
responsibly folks I thank you for being
here and also we like to patiently well
we don't enjoy it well sometimes we
enjoy well we'll use adult language here
and there only when appropriate of
course who speak freely we only use
inappropriate listen to each our minds
appropriately so fair warning there if
you have little ones around or something
like that you've been warned we we also
accept donations on this show it is
never required always appreciated will
be reading any comments or messages
attached to those donations at the end
of each half of today's stream so that's
right we actually stream each episode in
two halves
today's haft is uh today's first half as
streams to my channel on YouTube and
then in about an hour so we'll switch
over to Paul's channel youtube.com slash
Paul's hardware or you can find the link
in my video description if you're on
Twitch just stay where you are the whole
stream will be filmed right there and my
missing anything merchandise we saw
merchandise on both of our individual
stores mine's bit with tech slash store
where you can buy shirts hoodies peg
glasses regular glasses bottle openers
and and desk mats the desk mats are very
popular both the both the regular size
and the xl's are doing really well right
now so go ahead and pick one of those up
you can also head to Paul store if you
want more the same but different designs
same quality
pulsar Burnett Baltar Burnett where
you'll find an equally tantalizing
assortment same qualities and ice
slightly more tasteful
we also have awesome hardware China both
stores and if you buy the awesome
hardware merch such as the shirt that I
am wearing today yes
featuring the swordfight designed by
brian or the RGB everything designed by
one of you it was a contest design yeah
that's the design contest winner winner
yes
very classic but yeah that gets flipped
between us and we thank you for your
support your patronage and for watching
our show and well you'll just met you at
the end of the show if you buy something
from either of our stores double Johnson
if you buy from both of us cheers Cheers
that was a quite pretty efficient yeah
it seemed pretty pretty good oh there's
two pups on stream as well we have Hiro
and nori that was a hero that you just
heard he just gonna hear yeah cannot a
bone is Yakama bone yeah can I do that
all the time also the air conditioners
on cuz it's hot yes Paco it's really
really nice so I know what the high is
today would mid 90s here yeah you know
yeah not as hot as it could be but
definitely hot enough sure and later in
the day as calendar the Sun beats down
with great with great aplomb upon my
garage mmm yes all right but so let's
dive into our first segment on that
beautiful transition exactly starting
with hot and heavy hardware hey that's
quite appropriate kind of weather
conditions right now this it's perfect
that's a good transition yeah hey
redeemed now NZXT is launching a new
series digital power supply line lineup
this is an article from hexxus in fact
they've already launched it I think
today was was the big drop these units
are not by NZXT in house per se they're
actually using food excuse me
they're using see sonic focus plus goals
units at their core and the and so NZXT
is building upon the sonic units which
is good by the way I want to point that
out see sonic makes really good quality
power supplies for my experience I even
like the reviews on Johnny guru usually
praise most things that see sonic puts
out the gas
that are in this category so and what
NZXT has done they've come in and
they've added a couple nifty features
for monitoring and controlling your
power usage which is actually pretty
handy so it's I don't know if it's the
first of its kind maybe the first of its
kind that I'm aware of but it's pretty
nifty
you've got digital digital digital
digital readout never just zoom on it's
definitely not first there's okay but
there's definitely no monitor on the
unit itself as far as I can tell but
rather through the cam software so it
integrates Duke and there's a little
mini USB port if you look where some of
the other major connectors are where you
can plug into your motherboard right
there and yep there it is and and then
you can get real-time stats through camp
so there's a PM bus architecture they've
added a Texas Instruments DSP and like I
mentioned USB connectivity so it's it's
actually pretty cool 500 watts 650 watts
and 850 watts are all available all of
these units fall under an 80 plus gold
certification and the the TI DSP chip is
what gives you the real-time wattage
monitoring and it also gives you the
wattage across all three of the 12-volt
rails independently so you can kind of
see how each each rail is behaving and
you've also got real-time uptime and
internal temperature which is pretty
handy you can also check the the wattage
draw the power draw of your CPU
independent from your GPU CPU and GPU so
this is actually pretty handy if you're
this would be a good like benchmarking
power supply so you've got the plug-in
like a kilowatt every time or something
like that
obviously there's off the roam kilowatts
but I don't know I might throw this in
do like a test bench or something like
that
it seems pretty handy the year there's
an independence someone in chat asked
where the USB plugs in usually it goes
into a USB 2.0 head around
I have seen ones because like it's just
a whistle a micro plug on there right
yeah so yeah definitely you could use
any USB cable so you can you can in
theory route that out and plug it into a
USB port on the on an actual USB port on
your motherboard true but usually it
ships with like a cable that plugs in
USB 2.0 right a little block um there's
also independent over current protection
for the 12-volt outputs to the
motherboard CPU and GPU it's fully
modular you guys probably saw that from
the pictures 10 year warranty which is
pretty solid the fan is it operates at
zero decibels or zero rpm under 100
watts of load so if you're idling or
you're playing a really lightweight game
or something like that
power supply is probably gonna be dead
silent involved a lot of systems will
idle down in the 60 to 80 watt range yes
and then if you're looking for pricing I
only have the great British pounds right
here I didn't actually do the conversion
but the 500 watt is gonna be 115 great
British pounds the 650 watt at 130
pounds and the 850 at 139 or 149 pounds
oh I thought you were looking it up
right now no I was looking at the email
front - wait what the email from one
there is an email or mail from NZXT that
went out oh right
family about that anyway if he sauce
took a look at that for me
so 182 because I feel like the 650 watt
is what a lot of people would be going
for it's kind of a nice sweet spot for a
single GPU which is 182 translates to
182 us that's not per se the MSRP in the
US I'm just converting it on Google what
the Great British Pound conversion is to
USD so it says I have an 82 right here
but it could be you know 179 169 I'm not
sure but cool I think I think it's time
that power supply's became the least bit
interesting you know oh it's a good good
job in txt the key 500 is 125 dollars
the e 650 is 140 dollars oh wow and the
e8 50 is 150 oh thank you thank you for
looking that up all the 650 is actually
140 then as opposed to the 180 something
dollars that I looked up with a
conversion on Google so definitely a bit
more reasonable there it's still on the
expensive side though so I don't like a
power supply is something that people
will often get by with spending in the
40 to 70 or maybe 80 dollar range
because you can get a like what are
these rated are they gold
80 plus cold oh oh no yes the hey lady
to their existing level their existing
line of power supplies is frogs they're
all gold and amazing gold so gold gold
good anyone the expenses it could be
this was probably like if you removed
all the digital features and stuff all
the all the cool stuff that we just
talked about maybe it's a $90 to $100
power supply for the 650 watt and so you
have to consider you know is the extra
40 bucks if we're talking about the 650
watt unit worth the additional
monitoring
features select the cables are all black
monitoring control cables are black
that's a good student observation yes
okay Oh what no no here are just unplug
the camera oh when did that happen
looks like great yeah Oh at least you
caught it wasn't going to happen
yeah thank you our viewership just shot
up 20% after after our faces went dark
it says something today we can still
hear a third
not at 90 black night in the United
laughs it's funny that we've had it's a
good thing I you know mention some bitch
and I saw him flop down right there and
as like I thought did I hear something I
did give a pup disclaimer at the
beginning of this video of the stream so
you he just laid down right on the power
cord for the camera he really knows how
to get our attention all right cool so
that's that's the the E Series from NZXT
moving on to another article from hexxus
Texas really is uh
is where it's at when over a lot of
hardware launches and information stuff
so thanks to those guys for writing
these articles thermal tape or no
thermal right sorry thermal right
launched a new thread Ripper cooler for
tr4 called the Silver Arrow kind of like
that name sounds fun hmm I'm very
powerful and capable it's got a large
contact surface so it's looking to be
full a HS coverage and and it's got a
hundred deep pipes a lot of heat pipes
it's got eight eight nickel-plated six
millimeter heat pipes holy moly
and like I said the large contact
surface it's gonna be good for either
thread Ripper or epic CPUs both using
the same socket 144
I'm sorry hundred and forty millimeter
twin tower so you'll see it's a single
140 million little of millimeter fan
sandwiched between two fairly
substantial heat sinks or fin arrays and
then all those heat pipes so they're
permeating those okay pretty pretty
sweet it's kind of interesting colored
fan - it's not necessarily just a basic
red but like uh
looks like a cherry red or I maybe it's
just I remember the old fantex
air coolers yeah yeah it does remind me
of a slightly reminds me that those were
those the entire cooler was a specific
color right yeah it definitely is
reminiscent of that
it's got the brackets for for mounting
the fan on to the heatsink yeah
got a similar design there it also comes
with its own thermal paste which is
known to be fairly high quality it's
good and a decent looking screwdriver
but that's that's one thing that I
always noted from thermal thermal right
coolers is that they always include like
a really good magnetic tip full-sized
screwdriver which I mean most of us
already have something like that but
it's just really a really nice accessory
ISTEP that's actually the screwdriver
that I still use till this day for
everything for ninety percent of my
building is the one that I got out of
there macho macho zero cooler I don't
know if that's the right cooler but it's
completely fanless that's completely
family passive but amazing amazing
accessory there they're just doing
things thermo right there eight you know
better than those fisher-price grade
accessories they're not gonna treat you
they're more wrong that would that
that's yeah damn you're not fired today
I don't even I'm gonna try following
that up someone get some ice for this
boy turn he's hot turn thermo left
hey you quit while you were ahead yeah I
should stop all right
so that's fun moving on we've got an
article from overclocked 3d net about
another yet hot and heavy piece of
hardware this is the car or sire instead
of like a southern person of course they
are carbide spec zero 6 RG buddy
all right but it doesn't need to be RGB
they're also selling a non RGB version
of it that's thoughtful yeah it's a
budget ATX chassis the specs are as
follows up to get up up to ATX
motherboard support the most budget
cases don't support a ATX tempered-glass
side panel looks like it's got some like
you know a fairly thick black bezel
around it but ful full tempered glass it
doesn't like stop at the power supply
shroud like some bunch of cases do so
that's kind of cool the RGB model has a
3-3 switch controller so you can switch
between different colors different modes
etc and then there's the non RGB which
obviously omits that controller on the
front panel you've got seven expansion
slots six 120 millimeter fan mounts two
of which are included on either model
and pretty decent radiator support for
for a case like this 240 at the top 360
at the front no word as to whether or
not those can be concurrently installed
but that is nice to have those options
you've got for two and a half inch drive
mounts and two more standard three and a
half inch mounts power supply shroud
going across the entire depth of the
case which I like not a fan of like half
power supply routes just doesn't look
right and then the pricing here is
seventy nine and eighty nine us excuse
me Oh reppin up a storm today for the
non RGB and RGB variants respectively so
79 for non RGB 89 for the RGB
and it looks like the only RGB
implementation here is on the front
panel it's kind of got this interesting
sort of abstract design we there's a
little swoop a little a little Nike
check that whole thing there we just do
it just RGB it so that it looks like
some bottom with some bottom led to
firing up the bottom reminds me of
something it's a little yeah that's the
bottom that's that's the sound that that
thing would make okay make a noise okay
some of there's an underside look
underbelly was there's a cool dust
filter - that's good alright it looks
good inside like yeah I don't know if
the outside is my style personally but
functionally it looks pretty good where
is it in taking air from looks like the
top and bottom maybe something similar
to like H for 40 or s340 Oh see 3d
approves oc3 deivam yep okay it's got
this stamp of approval how video see
guys gonna watch the tongue we could've
watched um to the video oh yeah I like
time you know I met Tom at copy text for
the first time ever
oh yeah I thought I'd run into a lot
sooner and our journeys here in in tech
but he's really cool did he give you the
mic did he give you the old blob and
squidge he'll applaud that's great yes
okay everyone go watch Tom's video on
this you can see more of it do it all
right so let's the spec o 6rg be our
last spotting for hot and heavy hardware
it's again from overclocked 3d this is
about two gigabyte or SB 450 boards that
have been spotted online hey hey that
you might be interested in if you have
or planning to buy a second gen rise and
cpu because that's what this is for
there's the ATX or SB 450 Pro which is
pictured right there and it has most of
the features you would expect on an X
470 board it's pretty feature-rich for
what it is for being the more economical
of the two chipsets supporting second
gen risin then we've got beefier drm
heat sinks on here then then then
previous like beef be 350 boards that
you've seen eleven phase power for the
vrm dual m dot two slots with heat sinks
which I'm sure there will be some sort
of article or video from gamers Nexus as
to whether or not these these these are
helpful or hurtful I look forward to it
there should be hat keeping and hat
should be controller cool yeah cool
that's me they'd be a good segment name
cool and half right I don't know should
do that there's there's potential there
somewhere six SATA six ports 6g ports of
course single there's a single PCIe by
16 3.0 slot at the top that's reinforced
with that sort of metallic complaining
with metal with metal so metal
the second slot is physically Gen 3 by 4
but shares lanes with the board's top
and got two slot so be aware of that and
then both of those are wired directly to
AMD's aim for SOC so they're not running
through the be 450 chipset however the
second m2 slot shares for pcie 2.0 lanes
with the board's final or bottom PCIe by
16 slot and both of those are connected
and wired through the be 450 chipset so
there you go the rear i/o has two USB
3.1 gen2 ports two of them you know we
haven't seen we haven't seen many boards
up until this point with two USB 3.1
gen2 ports on the rear oh yeah I believe
that's one of the updates for the chips
yes yes yes yes yes of this six USB 3.1
gen2 VI and HDMI outputs and a single
Gigabit Ethernet port not sure if it's
Intel or killer I hope it's Intel
integrated IO shield that's kind of part
of the the cover there that's nice
and I like that that's becoming more of
a trend yeah absolutely that that's
becoming more and more of a nuisance
having to install the i/o shield and you
know what my problem is I sometimes
forget to remove the i/o shield when I'm
disassembling a system and I put the
motherboard back in the box but then the
i/o shield still in the case and then
like POW and then six months later I get
to I get that I pull the board out
because I need it I'm like where's i/o
shield oh it's in like a mesh if I see
that I forgot about six months ago Jim
Barry didn't shame in that Hawkins it is
if you're looking for something reverse
of pizza good if so I am Barry not my
wife should be home soon though I'm not
sure she's home seems a little early for
poppers
you shush all right so if you're looking
for something that's a little bit more a
little bit smaller normally I yell at
and berate them you know then you'd also
be yelling my ears or Galligan and
hundreds of hundreds of poor innocent I
don't really like them that's I just
physically be totally better no I don't
actions speak louder than words don't
those dogs know it no switches off doggy
mode emojis right now
then puppy mostly YouTube can't do that
dog you know YouTube does you don't just
type some dog dog dog dog dog a lot of
people same dog can you copy paste the
dog emoji from twitch doesn't work okay
moving on here the Auris be 450m is
something you might be interested in if
you're looking for some of the same
features and maybe design language of
the be 450 pro but you want to go micro
a to you micro it's cheaper it's got
smaller vrm heat sinks that cover fewer
components in the pro so you might not
get every last bit of overclocking
potential but that you find on the pro
board it still seems okay the single oh
there's a single M not to slot with pj e
3.0 by for connectivity with the board's
top PCIe by 16 slot having full PCIe
gen3 by 16 connectivity while the second
by 16 slot features pcie 3.0 by four
connectivity which is shared with the
single m dot 2 slot sure you got all of
that yeah this is expected to launch
this month alongside the Rison 320 300 X
and risin 520 500 X processor so we are
very much looking forward to all this
new hardware coming out options new
school
and thus concludes hot and heavy
hardware let's let's take a gander at
some more hot and heavy hardware wasn't
picked my PC oh yeah
what a smooth transition heck heck - the
freakin yes the PCs your word you know
because some of these things some some
of these systems that were looking at
today look a little heavy you just can't
stop
some of them are running a little hot
for the PCs it seems like marinas really
a continuation of the segment but look
there's dogs in YouTube now fountain you
oh wow okay wow they heard the call they
answered the call dogs in YouTube check
kids will show you there's at least
three different dog emojis we're not
safe it wasn't you know wolf Ella I
think that is well I didn't realize
there were so many different pup emojis
and there's a hot dog apparently I learn
something new every day you just have to
press windows I get it a hot dog haha
perfect windows clean de rien to bring
up the emoji list Windows key and period
yeah you've never done that what
what is this like common knowledge that
we're all born with is this instinctual
and I just missed the boat here no I
just did this work for twitch two things
you have to learn over time what this is
this is just windows these are windows
icons so Windows 10 thing I have never
ever seen this or heard of it well now
you know my love there's even more when
you need a new segment of code like long
and prosper
you needed a new segment called like
Windows 10 sucks but here are some hacks
that's the whole segment max all right
now it's time so I'll do full full
confession even though it's slightly
embarrassing of why is I like the reason
I was kind of excited when I knew that
or when I found that out is because I
got irritated cuz like if you ever want
to do if I ever want to do an emoji in a
tweet you know which it makes it fun
right
put your little emoji in there makes
makes more fun it's all Twitter maybe
it's my phone but sometimes it's easier
just like I met the computer and let's
type it out yeah and I was like there's
got to be a wet away with Windows right
so do it and like and you looked it up
turns out I feel like it I don't know if
I looked it up specifically or if I if
it is everybody just encountered that
dilemma and like then
you know also sort of coincidentally at
about the same time discovered that um
there you go yeah Oh Windows keep period
okay before you know Joe enjoy your
enhanced textual communication so that's
someone's but what so I'm do it at this
point
yep it's also fun too
because there's some that are there in
Windows that don't work like there's a
ninja cat you try to do the ninja cat
really it like in on Android it just
appears as like the ninja emoji and the
cat emoji separately which is kind of
weird wait how do you get rid of it oh
you there's an X yeah hey it works
ninja cat did that's the ninja cat right
yeah but no that's the ninja cat the
black ninja right wouldn't make a ninja
turtle looks like turtle what do you I
don't know what that it looks so good
old it looks it's a sad grandma it's a
crying Ninja Turtle - good grandpa ninja
cat okay of course right here - crying
ninja turtle face emoji bearded bearded
crying ninja turtle face yeah I feel
like appropriate in many many situations
like my mom right now just discovering
new tech features on her phone okay
alright let's let's get into this right
now
pip my PC Francisco he tweeted me some
pictures of his rig just in case you
haven't seen this haha that leads me to
believe the system's inside of an in
case I have one which it totally is
becoming relevance achieved look how
little putty in it is little booty on
little petty little poonanny and I don't
know diminutive do small me too yes
wayney so okay
it's a rising system mm-hmm looks like
we've got maybe eight or sixteen things
of brandy a--that's-- Corsair Vengeance
led he didn't provide spec so we're
gonna have to get some on some of this
stuff yeah there's definitely a founders
edition card in here
it's a looks like it those six pin the
minutes of GTX 1060 dip that's a 6 pin
yeah
doesn't the doesn't the stock 1070 of a
single 8-pin there's a 6-pin 1070 is a
steep in a business six-minute venture
that's there looks like a six but like
oh maybe it's Nathan
it might be an apron okay what's Nathan
then it's probably a 1070 because I
think the six I think 1060 is a 6-pin
know it's always missing my fingers and
ten sides you gotta be a 1070 year yes
mystery solved
I almost didn't see the SLI figure
because he's got the cap on it still but
okay very nice system so I'm gonna guess
maybe a rising seven chip if you're
pairing it with the 1070 yeah because
it's also the rise and led to race which
which one has the LEDs the wraith RGB
late max wraith max I think wraith max
which is well she came with what the
1800 x is that way or did you have to
buy the special one that had the wraith
max i forget which one it came with
yeah it's lost on me Kinsella review
sample script from an AMD so we have the
retail so a practical just a practical
poignant like I can appreciate the
aesthetic touches of the aftermarket
power supply cables um however like
those probably cost you good eighty
bucks I mean you've got you've got a pen
24 pin and this year so probably I felt
something in my foot and I look down and
here I just booked it here's here's
really causing he's making this a more
exciting show this time so I just I feel
weird that you invested in that and you
still got a stock cooler it's not a
terrible stock cooler it's it's good for
a stock cooler but it is still a stock
cooler and there's definitely
improvements that could be made to that
so that's just a thought I think I'm
okay with the stock cooler because it's
in the end case okay I feel like he
doesn't have many great options with
that much space and there's lots of
great options
I mean Shores low profile but I mean
ones that are gonna be quieter and
perform better than that cooler I've got
one sure there are but ya know I'm a
sucker for the reef for the reef coolers
I think they're great I think they're
great I think that's and to me that's a
selling point of horizon CPU is that it
comes with a great cooler
yeah is this the oh no that's that's a
slightly NHL 12s Lowepro this let me see
they never put the picture of the actual
core in the box which always bothers me
not to I they don't have to sell their
products they just make them really good
I'm gonna buy it either way I just want
to see what it looks like cares about
marketing or making it an attractive
color or putting a picture of it on the
box
it's just they just like Noctua it's
good weed really there's there's some
slight changes that could probably
improve theirs over I feel like walked
into knock to his office and you saw a
bunch of like engineers there where's
your marketing team we are where's your
engineering team it's just us okay so
yeah this is this is a really nice this
is this is a really nice cooler yes it's
got a slim fan here but you could
probably even well I guess you couldn't
mount one on top but let's see is this
doing it looks like it's pushing air
through it towards the top that's a good
cooler though I've never actually used
this one is this for a particular
project that yep coming up no I was just
having using it with the mini ITX build
in there but I think it's slightly too
large for that sure although I still
might double check because now that I've
got everything in there I'm kind of like
hmm but what I wanted to do was use this
because you can also mount a fan on top
of this if you if you're not as
concerned about the height so you can do
a full size header than 20 millimeter
fan so you can put a good fan on this
and then it becomes a very if you put a
fan on top does it conflict with the
clip here or no I think it comes with
other clips
okay boxy you can use for 120 people not
that this is a bad fan it's just it's
just a slim fan so it's not gonna play
as effective in it we're getting very
distracted here but
that's okay my point is before I would
drop the cash on those extensions I
would improve the CPU cooler first
that's that's just what I would do doing
stuff pretty good stuff okay
Mickey that's why we don't unbox things
life is also known but apart from that
so your system looks great there's a bit
of color clash with the cables and the
card and the fans on the bottom but if
that's your style go for it I would
consider maybe something in there to
prop up the GPU a little bit cuz the sag
there is standing out to me okay yeah
yeah it's like a picture and you got a
fan right there but I bet you could like
insert something there that would just
kind of hold it up a little bit bent
room heavy all yeah thank you
sweet sweet bill ma'am 1017 Francisco
for sending that over next is Keith
McCray high-five 4690k EVGA GeForce 962
gig gigabyte z97 ex motherboard 16 gigs
of kingston hyperx ddr3 memory quickly
cxm 50 power spot fractal mesh if I see
oh there it is there it is okay wait
whoa doc Intel cooler see total opposite
story with an Intel stock cooler
these things are noisy they don't
perform all that great at all it's so
small and you have such a nice system
look look all right
here's where I would use Paul's exact
argument that he just left us which is
why did you buy the really really nice
extensions damn they look really nice
and what was that cool as a theme maybe
maybe a theme that we don't expect going
into this but I have the exact same
argument that Paul did now I'm totally
on Paul's side like see the Wraith is
much better much much better than this
and you have an overclocked CPU here the
40 4690k
I don't know man I would I would have
spent the money on the cooler first
maybe there's this it's a situational
thing and you have a reason for it but
now that everything else about your
system looks pretty spot-on
yeah it looks so quiet damn fucking
cooler let's just stand it out yeah
that's a total eyesore Aslan would be
perfect if you had a an aftermarket
cooler there not that I can take my type
as of this for too long but I could I
could you could retie this cable here
your exhaust fan in the back yes that
could be tidied up slightly doesn't that
just get you the gap of get a different
cooler yeah it's worth it dabble with
some some overclocking a little bit I'm
also wondering if those are the correct
DIMM slots because I usually see that
she slots two and four are the primary
ones if you only have two sticks
installed often it doesn't know not all
boards up in it's the first first and
third or the second and fourth okay yeah
she was just putting it out there
this is replied to his by Andrew crane
okay so oh so he updated the cooler 1080
and new CPU cooler in the mail and then
he of course their BX 950 boot drive and
one turbine okay so all right so he's so
this is obviously apparently still a bit
of work in progress since he is
currently in process of upgrading the
GPU and a new CPU cooler so okay because
like with that Keith but did he post a
picture of it down below well this is
somebody replying to him hello I see who
also has a mesh if I see okay okay Keith
we might not feature you again on the
show but we just some some updated
pictures once you get those word updated
hardware is in there next up we got Zack
it's his third PC he's ever built first
rigid tubing zack tactless it's the
first time he's ever done rigid tubing
so let's go to mainly say Zack back
exactly my name is zak bagans stop -
that's a cool last name I've got a 2600
X there's a sparse rigid tubing yeah
overclocked 24.3 on asus crosshair hero
6 with 16 gigs of g.skill tread @zr gb
ram at 3000 megahertz in an Rx bag at 56
very nice my storage is an m dot 2
samsung 256 gig and he's got a 3
terabyte mechanical hard drive so oh wow
he's got a model block on there too I
don't see mini Vega 56 is around because
I feel like no one has bought them for
anything cuz I haven't really been but
mining and stuff super accessible yeah
um but damn this is really nice this is
I mean that's a you've got a model block
up on your CPU on your 2600 X and you've
got a water block on your on your
graphics card and on the Vegas at 56 I
hope this beautiful looking system is
only on the floor temporarily oh cool
it's time to be temporary
oops does that would suck to put all
this effort into building a hard-line
cooling system and then just keep it on
this before you can't escape Paul people
he will he will notice and he will find
out and he will point it out it's you if
you leave your system on the floor which
I wholeheartedly agree with he's just
much more vocal than I am but ok moving
back to the system for your first hard
line tubing job I'll be honest we can
tell but we commend you for the effort
because it's a very intimidating task
very intimidating undertaking that that
you've gone ahead with and you know what
it's functional and you're not getting
any leaks I'm sure your temperatures are
fantastic but if we are talking pet my
PC here I would like to straighten out
some of these beds
yeah just to maybe make them a bit more
like all the vertical bends I like to
see them parallel with the edges of the
case with the front and back ear case
and then all the top the ones going
laterally I'd like to see those parallel
with the floor perpendicular to those
vertical tubes it's just kind of like
you know your basic
rigid to bending 101 I guess and keep
keep doing things parallel or
perpendicular I mean brain you can you
can do an angle but it has to be
intentional and right here it's just
that looking quite as intentional yeah
like I I compared this to like the you
know when you're talking to a pilot
about a landing like any landing that
you can walk away from is a good one
like this is obviously a functional
water cooling loop it's not leaking so
especially for a first time you know
right there you go yeah I like the
lighting though it looks pretty cool
with that get a really nice look at
everything so yeah and then maybe some
custom sleeves some of the sling
extensions might be nice yeah that would
that would top things off sure are from
that though I like the drain here at the
bottom - yeah that makes it really easy
if you want to drain the system and then
try try your hand at redoing some of
those two bends so thanks Zack all right
thank you very much Zack distant aqus
Nixon we have John John has an i-5 4945
93.3 here it's cooler master hyper 212

supply Zalman z9 neo black case Zalman
case
Ivan asked myself why what are you helps
users Elma guess what compels one to buy
is every time I've like handled a Zalman
case I've always been like I don't like
this case yeah like yeah me too and just
I don't know it's a it's got to be the
price I'm not really been impressed by
one well it's kind of cool that makes
that pattern makes a Z but yeah there's
lots of there's lots of them and you
tried lots of them that I've ever heard
I'm sure maybe some of them are okay
sure so yeah you got the Z for Zelman so
that's we can appreciate that and we
also have a red and blue color scheme
looks like the only believe you have
here is with the LEDs you got two blue
LED fans at the top those are the clear
stripper keel fans that Paul and I
usually is write off as a no-no and
you've got some blue LED on your
graphics card which I think you should
just go all red band and maybe maybe
that SSD the only piece of hardware
that's actually blue here had is what
convinced you or inspired you to make it
semi blue here but I think you can spray
paint that SSD red or hide it somewhere
else in the case that's not visible and
just go all red here that's what I would
do again if you like if you love the red
and blue then keep it I don't I don't
mind the red in the blue no no I I mean
I agree with you about the fans I don't
like the top fans right but that's my
thing if he's swapping out the fans you
might as well make him right
but I kind of like the two-tone color
like black and then you got red and red
and blue I don't think they clash or
anything like that I think you could
swap out those top fans with some blue
LED fans that look kind of like the red
LED fan on the that you got on the back
and I think it would still work I'm just
saying I feel like if you like the red
and the blue I don't think I don't think
I think for me what it is is if I'm
gonna do a mishmash of colors than I
want I want both of them to have equal
share equal parts Hardware
representation like I don't want one
color to just be represented by LEDs
alone and of course he does have a blue
SSD is what I feel like I predicted
yourself no of course and he does have a
blue SSD but I wasn't finished but I
want to see more than just one component
in that color maybe some blue memory
sticks to contrast the red accents on
your motherboard
I think might look pretty cool if you're
really gonna own it and and go with that
that color combo okay maybe consider
modding some of the fans so that you
have red LEDs but then maybe you
spray-paint the the frames blue or maybe
the corners of the frames blue or
something like that just just just
planting some seeds planting some
thoughts here ketchup and mustard cables
though as well word I definitely need to
be dealt with but thank you John yep I'm
gonna switch over to J hall and I'm
going to try to preemptively stop
talking right now
oh yeah mrs. Paul's hardware is home the
pups have caught on to that fact and
Paul is now going to tranquilize both of
them yeah he's he's pulling up
oh it's a it's a blow blow dart gun that
he's got interesting oh oh and there
goes hero it's just an or he's freaking
out because she sees fellow heroes
falling down yeah you see oh there's a
second one he needs a little extra
little extra there's no second arrow
yeah inori's Nori's next and down
alright that's how it's done folks
that is how you dog own what okay what
yes is it Alma game no what is that
I like darkness hello darkness my old
friend is that who do we have to thank
for that
the same person no see no my name's last
week and that we thanks the show before
Computex yes I can just forget his name
but cool russian imperial stouts surly
Brewing Company with the Cerritos
Cerebus Cerebus is a three-bean yes sir
Cerberus Cerberus Cerberus Cerberus Asus
made a graphics card called the Cerberus
it was that sense wtn good card
alright cool um so last last dude last
due to the day is Jay Hall and let's
quickly talk about his break he's got a
he said how about am i how about my kids
how about my kids system Phenom to 950
question mark to buy two gigs of ddr3
1600 Radeon 64-54 gigs of course air
force another question wire cutter and
20 gig SSD under hdds and thermal take
600 watt power supply
alright let's take a look here Wow okay
I'm sure it's fine for a kids PC in
terms of the performance but it's got to
be noisy with that stock cooler that
stock AMD cooler is the loudest loudest
cooler period I've ever ever encountered
yeah in my opinion that specific one cuz
AMD's have a lot of stock coolers from
that era but that one in particular is a
freaking jet engine
this isn't that Asus is blue phase yeah
yep Mountain blah blah blah Picasso had
a blue was it called the blue phase the
blue blue the blue period
I don't even know I'm not I'm not artsy
and Asus had one of those historic I'm
QR ACS had one of those too yeah like
it'd be interesting to do a video on
like the different trends that
motherboard manufacturers or any
manufacturers and it's a blue period the
blue period
castles blue period just like asus asus
had a blue period back in like the p67
days yeah 67 z77
and then they have a gold period which
no one approved oh yeah how's the period
we don't talk about any more I'm glad
that's over
at least the blue is a little bit more
tasteful okay my sister will take power
supply there were lots of these this is
a good power supply is it cables look
hideous
but they sure do in the day in Paris
there was lots of crappy power spikes
going around this one this one was a
solid long-term use nice okay so apart
from that I mean I don't know man
there's you can't do anything about this
system aesthetically and you can't
really do much about mobile management
in this case II there's no options
there's nowhere to put the cables just
just burn everything we don't really
have a picture of the outside much but I
can child by this drive mounting system
that there is no behind the hard drive
behind the motherboard tray anything
here yeah so so yeah just scrap it put
the side panel back on that's that's my
recommendation for this side panel back
on and then burn it
that will probably block some of the no
noise from that stock and a cooler just
a little bit yes yep that's that's
really all I hope we can give you right
now Jaeho thank you guys so much for
submitting those and thus concludes good
my PC yeah let's quickly blaze through
some news articles here because damn we
are a little suddenly short on time I
know and now just been rambling around
my hope that happened okay
Intel and AMD talent Wars heat up
according to the WCC f10 this is a
pretty quick article here you can read
it more extensively if you want the
details I'm gonna summarize really quick
this is basically talking about the
talent war is that that's been going on
between Intel and AMD which started in
September I'm sorry which started it in
and November yeah it's a really weird
mashup which started in November of 2016
when Intel hired a really talented
engineer named Martin Ashton to be the
VP of core and visual computing group he
was responsible for the initial workings
of what would what will eventually
become Intel's full-blown GPU efforts
but then a year later Intel also stole
from AMD
Roger Kaduri oh yeah remember that no
it's now it's huge news and Chris hook
both from Team red Intel just snagged
him they hooked it up while also
coaching Tesla's Jim Keller and bringing
back Tom Forsythe AMD was undoubtedly
not too thrilled about that so they
struck back Andy strikes back by by
getting Robert Gama who's their chief HR
and he stole Martin Ashton from Intel so
the guy that and this kind of worked out
from Martin Ashton because Aston was you
know hired to this huge undertaking it
Intel working their GPU thing the GPU
segment but then Raja kind of just got
slipped in there and according to the
article Raja kind of took precedent and
sort of got a lot of the attention for
the GPU efforts from Intel and so Ashton
kind of felt sidelined which was a
perfect opportunity for AMD to come in I
can't sad that mesh tab swooped in from
Intel and now it's getting fiery folks
and then Intel fired back it's just a
back and forth Intel cleaned house
snatching up some serious AMD talent
alexander liya Chev the skete so
seriously talented that I can't
pronounce their name which is an
engineer
Jason Gunderson also an engineer right
Rena Krishna did two three
an AI engineer in Joseph fucka which was
formerly at AMD not at the time they
hired him but he used to work at AMD so
Intel is clearly very serious about
their GPU efforts and this talent war is
is just it's it's serious business the
talent that you have of your company
means a lot these people are getting
paid very well to do what they do and
bringing their expertise their knowledge
to lead teams into developing amazing
hardware that's going to be cutting edge
and competitive against these companies
rivals so pretty soon we might be seeing
Intel joining the big two when it comes
to GPU manufacturers Nvidia and AMD
by the way the reason why AMD didn't
snag up anyone from Nvidia is because
during this time for the last couple of
years
Nvidia stock has been doing really well
and a lot of the execs and engineers
high up in the chain of command at
Nvidia are sitting pretty they don't
they're not looking for other options
they're happy because in videos just
killing it I've been happy with their
existing options
yeah stock options exactly the stock
options are phenom at Nvidia so that's
that's why Intel sort of targeted one
top finance ton yep those crank the AC
up a few notches um all right so that's
all I want to say it's you know two big
boys on the big playground duking it out
should be a shell don't have to tell me
twice
this next article is from globe news
wire it's one of the headlines in the
title of this broadcast it's about the
new industry standard that's been
introduced for connecting next gen VR
headsets to PCs and other devices this
is yes / turd everywhere is on the
hardware subreddit it was on wucf tech a
bunch of other articles publications so
basically there's a there's a new
industry consortium of sorts that's led
by the folks at Nvidia oculus valve AMD
and Microsoft which all of them this
consortium introduced today the virtual
link specification it's an open industry
standard that enables next-gen VR
headset to connect with PCs and other
devices using a single high bandwidth
USB type-c connector instead of a range
of cords just simulating the experience
we need the air
for anyone who hasn't had the privilege
of trying out an H MD or VR headset yet
that's exactly what it's like you're not
what six missing much yeah you you've
been there you just you just saw it
right why they don't just any bother
play that clip back for people rather
than spending the exorbitant amounts of
money right you see those lines at CES
and Computex for all those VR demos it's
like not just just bringing rain hmm
stacking the Santa I'm sure would be ah
so this is USB see a single USB type-c
connector it also just reminds us of the
versatility of type C and just the fact
that it can be so high bandwidth and
have carries so many different
specifications and standardizations
instead of just having like a bunch of
cords that you have to plug in remember
my my HTC vive has like three or four
things you got to plug in like one or
two USB you got HDMI and then another
one for power whereas USB can do that
USB type-c can do that it can it can
carry power as well in fact this spec
actually supports up to 27 watts of
power in addition to delivering for
high-speed HBR 3 DisplayPort lanes which
are scalable for future needs a USB 3.1
data channel for supporting high
resolution cameras and sensors we're
gonna need those cameras for for room
scaling from room tracking augmented
reality and so forth this is all through
a single USB type-c connection
ladies and gentleman and it's been
adopted by as a standardization spec
that we will be seeing for for future
generations of VR HMDs I think it's cool
there's more penguins than then
than the White House Thunderball right
is it yeah I mean it's sounds like it it
needs to be Thunderbolt isn't
necessarily wait what's the bandwidth
the bandwidth actually is not listed
here's crappy article from globe news
wire doesn't say doesn't say the actual
bandwidth like I said for high-speed HBR
3 DisplayPort lanes and a USB 3.1 data
Channel but there's no actual spec for
the actual bandwidth at any rate this is
gonna be pretty sweet because I feel
like it's also gonna allow HMDs to plug
into smaller devices more mobile
maybe portable devices like laptops and
notebooks when it only needs a single
USB type-c connector as opposed to like
having like four or five plugs that you
need to put in to a single device yes
this is good and things are good and
gonna bolt this 40 gigabit for a second
I believe I believe this is like 42 or
42 just I'm just barely barely edging
out Thunderbolt which makes sense
because I feel like the demands here are
pretty pretty high for VR carrying that
signal for the updated resolutions and
stuff now the next gen of headsets will
require and support next article here is
from hot hardware Intel is is to present
soldered CPUs on August 1st going up to
5.5 gigahertz this is a rumour Rumour
okay but it's it's a rumor that's been
circulated in plenty of areas online and
seems to be like a good rumor if that
makes any sense a semi trusting
trustworthy rumor but again a rumor so
nitrogen core family is allegedly
launching this month it's gonna compete
with second gen right and of course
based on previous leaks and rumors some
more rumors here the three processors we
know about include the core I $9.99
hundred K with eight cores and 16
threads that would
the only chip so far that's been that
we've been made aware of party 2.4 42.4
okay
point for going back to the old Wow
sorry cuz they by the way 32.4 gigabits
per second for video video bandwidth and
send gigabits per second for USB 3 ok
data bandwidth right so ok thank you for
clearing that up so we've got them the
i9 quarry 999 hundred K which will be
the first time in Intel main stream CPU
family history where we have an i-9 with
8 cores let alone hyper-threading with
16 threads the i7 9700 k which would be
probably the more direct successor to
the 8700 k with 6 cores and twelve
threads probably just gets a nice basin
boost clock up great I believe that the
core i5 9600 K with six cores and six
threads so there have been anonymous
sources who have signed NDA's with Intel
claiming that multiple samples have
reached five point five gigahertz while
overclocked I'm not sure exactly how
trustworthy someone who breaks an NDA is
but if they're right probably not very
trustworthy but if they're right that's
pretty cool we don't really know which
samples that they tested are actually
able to hit those clock speeds but 5.5
gigahertz it's pretty stellar now
obviously that higher clock speed would
bring in a lot more heat and sources the
same anonymous sources are also saying
that these new chips will feature solder
heat spreaders in in in place of the the
standard crappy thermal interface
material that intel has faced so much
criticism for in the past so gamers
Nexus did it they did it they are they
realize Rupp ting the industry like
Intel look you're you're throwing
performance away and they spoke the
right language of
Hey money money and Intel's listening
that's all you have to say to Intel yeah
money that's how you get their attention
good job Steve and GN team so yeah if
they're using their own if they're
ditching the crappy Tim and they're you
know using summer heat spreaders that
would explain how they're able to
partially explain how they're able to
hit those higher overclocks the other
you know aspect would be the refinement
of the architecture and stuff like that
it's hard to say which skews again we
hit five point five if the rumors proved
to be true anyway even so um yeah look
forward to nitrogen more CPUs yay more
content by the way for those in chat
hurt art confused gamers Nexus I mean
they're not the only ones I was kind of
joking they're for gamers Nexus among
others Hamptons quite a few different
tests where they deal it'd install
processors derp Bauer's probably
probably also should be named here
because you can deal with them you can
remove the crappy thermal paste you can
just put better thermal pastes and get
better temperatures and thus better
performance or they've done a bunch of
testing with liquid metal and that kind
of thing but yeah that the the statement
I remember Steve making in one of the
videos that I was watching was like
Intel like you're throwing performance
away you're making a product that can
perform at X value and then you're doing
this thing to it that makes it crappier
than it is like spends these little bit
amount of investments to your bomb cost
or whatever
that improves that and suddenly you'll
have a better more competitive products
make sense yeah this is they do spins I
do I mean I don't know I don't even know
how much money they spend developing
processors like that but there's a lot
of work that goes into that it seems
kind of ridiculous to just take this one
little part of manufacturing involved
with okay heat spreader and thermal says
easy and like cheap improve that process
and then you yeah I agree entirely okay
so that's fun fun facts I mean tell
potentially launching nitrogen for CPU
soon let's move on to our next article
really quick PC sales are growing for
the first time in six years this
articles from the verge I also verified
this on some other publications so yeah
there's a couple Mart marketing research
firms Gartner and IDC who both agree
that PC market has shown growth in the
second quarter of this year they have
slightly different percentage increases
that they're attributing this to so
there's 2.7 percent increase for for IDC
but Gardner's claiming it sleep in a one
point four percent increase the
difference is because I DC's data
includes Chromebooks but it excludes
Windows tablets that include devices
with detachable keyboards for example
the surface pro whereas Gardiner's data
is kind of the opposite include it
includes windows-based tablets as pcs
and it excludes Chromebooks or any non
windows-based tablet so they have
different ideas of how they define a PC
I guess that's what it boils down to
Chromebooks appeared to be powering some
of the PC growth last year but Gardner's
data shows that it's also from regular
desktop PCs and Macs
not just Android tablets and Chromebooks
so I guess our community has something
to do with this growth is what I'm what
I'm hearing what I'm getting out of this
the first year every year we're seeing
the first year-over-year PC shipment
growth since the first quarter of 2012
it's been six years since we've seen
this kind of trend
windows10 business pcs so in corporate
environments and workstation
environments are powering some of this
growth in the second quarter of 2018
which is offset by declining shipments
in the consumer market there's an
analyst of Gartner that predicts that PC
momentum in the business segment however
will start declining in about two years
once once all these businesses have
finished switching over to Windows 10
because you know they're formerly either
on Windows 7 or Windows XP god forbid
Windows Vista those businesses probably
aren't in business anymore yeah so um so
yeah all in all takeaway here is that PC
is is looking good and we're on a bit of
that tremendous growth but the first
sign of growth in quite some time and
the big five the big five in the PC
business includes HP Lenovo Dell Apple
and Acer who all saw growth in this area
and then there's a sort of soulstone
last one the soul stone I don't know it
Thanks
the soulstone
is this is this like a Lord of the Rings
reference that I'm gonna get that I'm
not picking up is it Infinity Ward
Marvel Avengers Thanos Avengers yeah did
you see it yes I have never did I
haven't seen it okay that's fine I've
been really bad about my movies like I
haven't seen the last Jedi I haven't
seen solo I haven't seen Black Panther
and I haven't seen Avengers infinity war
like I live under a rock I've been
living under a rock for the last several
months so it's it's not okay thank you
for making me feel relevant right I'm
sorry
right around the time Black Panther came
out we saw Black Panther and then we
kind of went on a kick going back and re
watching Marvel Cinematic Universe
movies that we had missed mm-hmm so we
kind of caught up with that and that
means huh oh yeah still haven't seen and
and
and the wasp oh yeah that's another one
that excuse me it's humble it's a you're
gonna pipe things there were six there's
six stones never might continue okay
relevance achieved yes some stone could
also be a World of Warcraft II port okay
and then the last article of today is
quickly from the verge once again Amazon
about Amazon crashing on prime day yeah
really quick those of you who were
trying to participate or actually got to
participate in prime day might be aware
that the site was down for a lot of us
particularly in the LA New York and
Pacific Northwest area Pacific Northwest
is where Seattle is located which is
where Amazon is based so that makes
sense we experienced the biggest outages
so Paul and I obviously live in New York
or LA and it was down for for me wasn't
down for you did you even check who's
down for me for a good eight hours and
then for about two hours I could not log
on from about 12:05 Frank they started
it 12:00 at noon so 12:05 to like 2 p.m.
it just was not working at all that's an
endless loops this is like this also
could be like a std distribution okay
the most sexually active oh yeah they
were sexually active right nope no
wonder it no wonder those two coasts are
the most populated to engaging in
unprotected sex but at the very least
the silver lining here is that even
though the Amazon site was down for
millions of people yesterday we've still
got to meet the dogs of Amazon ah and
that's really really really really what
we're looking at at the finish line here
folks
so yeah Amazon does have a pretty
adorable way of telling you that their
site is down and you can't buy shit by
posting these lovely pictures of all the
dogs some of the dogs that Amazon
employees Oh
that are owned by Amazon employees so
very very adorable it's very adorable
way to say it's more Doug you are front
bags very adorable way like tags like
Danks
what Dad oh I like caravans better hey
man is what is man great movie to watch
nature alright every part is a new boss
I think my favorite scene is with Tyrone
in the car okay so anyway that's all for
tech news that's all for the show we
have donations and store and you guys
have most graciously upon us so the
Gilmore $10 is there a worthwhile RGB
air cooler for my new AMD 2600 X or
should I just find an RGB fan to throw
on my hyper 212 plus I like the Craig
sees a h7 Claude loo me yes
that's a really good cooler if you're
looking for some RGB Flair decently
priced and decent performance as well
would be more than adequate for a 2600 a
cooler master I can't keep the product
names down but they've they've had some
recent launches that are I can't air
cooler with our GB fans and stuff like
that yeah but maybe check those out too
I like some of the large EB controllers
that they come with because if your
motherboard doesn't natively support
like the addressable ones
Toller that maybe comes along with it
true that's helpful yep David Harvey $5
build or buy and mass built build is
funner yeah and more fun more fun more
flexible more flexible and more
serviceable in case something goes wrong
it's hard to service like one of those
WD NASA's if if it just I will say the
nice thing about buying can be that the
little control boards that they use are
like very purpose-built or they're
specifically chosen to be able to kind
of just handle the tasks of the NASS so
you can potentially get better like
power usage from that mm-hmm here Oh
what are you doing
so maybe unless you want to buy like a
workstation board or something like that
that has those high rated components for
24/7 operation he looks like he's
anxious or something are you okay boy
sometimes he gets nervous okay new and
five dollars and thank you both without
Kyle's how to build a PC and Paul's
first five things videos my current rig
would not exist you guys are out some
Thank You Luke yeah you're awesome yeah
and those two videos go really well like
go hand-in-hand you know you know I've
had to build a PC video too you could
use it at school first know the first
five things mega man's clearly but
that's that's clearly what he's saying I
should I should do remake er and every
day did that money but the update
windows and start thank you Luke
thanks man envy sixty seven thirteen
dollars and 37 cents Kyle I enjoyed your
anti prime an anti Amazon Prime live
video I was persistent though and wound
up getting an i7 eighty seven hundred K
for $2.99 and nice and of course there H
100 Ivete v2 AIO 479 bucks from the
prime base sales that's pretty good
those are some of the better prime deals
that I've I've actually heard of so
congrats man I'm glad that you actually
got something out of that out of that
day yeah that is nice that's that's some
good savings right there for sure
and also you tweeted me and replied to
something and mentioned that the Nvidia
shield I think it was was going on sale
on Prem day for like 139 without pretty
damn good and I looked for it I looked
for it all day yesterday and I looked
for today but the price never changed it
was still 179 I don't know if I missed
it I might have missed it I was like
that'd be cool I should get a shield
maybe fiddle with some GeForce now or
something now that it's supported but I
don't know I could have missed it or
maybe and you even linked the article he
even linked an article from every day
which publication that said yeah it's
definitely gonna be 139 but I don't know
I'm glad prime day worked out better for
you that it did for me and I'm also glad
that you enjoyed the livestream I loved
a lot of fun doing it if you guys
haven't checked out the livestream it's
still fairly relevant
go watch that live Jim it's about 45
minutes it's not tremendously long but I
point out a lot of really good deals on
new egg because Amazon was down
the time and the new egg deals unlike
prime they are going on for the next
three days so you can still pick up a
lot of those really good deals 16 gig
kit of ddr4 for like 130 bucks I was
lying
from team which isn't like like a bad
brand by any means so I'm some good
stuff on there go check it out
thanks I'm beat except there they're
called team group and I think that's
redundant okay you would face Butler two
thousand seven dollars do you know if
there is an angled USB 3.1 front panel
mobo connector slash adapter I've been
looking for one the last few days and I
haven't found one I'm sure Paul has just
the answer for you as he's been looking
up into that corner of his his garage
this is the only one I have found what
does that mean it's Lee Utley oh yeah
so it's me there you go bye Lee Anne Lee
this is a 45 centimeter port note 46
centimeters right 5 centimeter yeah one
so I use this when I when I upgraded
arctic air pure panther and a hydrogen
and a USB 3.1 to that but I found this I
bought two of them and then like you
can't buy them anymore really well at
least the link that I added to this one
they're not available oh so there's a
there's a specific length limit for
these I think it's 60 centimeters
you can't go longer than that which is
why you're not seeing them quite as
frequently because that reposition data
point in the case that can actually
reach where the header might be on your
motherboard sure
so yeah sixty centimeters is as long as
they get this one if you want to try to
find it go look at my video on arctic
panther casemod where I added USB 3.1 to
that and it's linked in that description
or PW - I see zero one NH 4 5 it's the
model this is a model here so if you can
find that then maybe you can buy one
thanks to the yes cool I've got to
that's why I have one month you could
sell anyone feel like you have it's mine
alright thanks makes that info Paul pup
Shepherd $5 wags wags silly puppies and
family oh never mind never mind
plug check me out if you're into stuff
he's getting more audacious with every
episode I'm starting to scare me go
check out up Shepherd at your own risk
fellas ok Philip frames still Bram
sounds like a puppy look for fans is a
great porn name awesome name was like
Richard hey dick Rams
ok $10 mr. Kyle did you ever try out
that mysterious USB thumb drive you got
in the mail mail time a while back and
unleash Skynet upon the world no but
that's a potential video that I'm
considering doing because it's really
kind of bogus once I realized what it
was and what it does it's kind of
scamming it's very scammy
not to me but to the customer that's
appealing to anyway I might do a video
on it thanks for bringing it up thank
you for the donation as well mr. Harvey
comma David $10 what to upgrade first
2600 X at 4.1 gigahertz H 100 IV to be
350 tomahawk 4x4 gig
a kit of 3200 mega mega Hertz LP X 500
gig 860 Evo 2 terabyte Barracuda 1070 I
armor in a dark base 700 I won the case
from you Kyle hey congratulations again
on that case win um
damn what to upgrade first I would say
you're good honestly you're fine yeah
don't yeah becomes any tonight damn
you're good to go you're good man
nothing upgrade nothing like yeah
there's a bit faster systems and more
powerful systems to get there but unless
you're doing a bunch of video rendering
or something like that that would
actually take advantage of like a 16
core 1950 X or something which would
require you to upgrade your entire
platforms like much more expensive
motherboard instead like you got you
have a nice setup you consider some
investments in the aesthetics exactly it
may be example extension kit or
something yep
look look to cosmetics cuz your hardware
is perfect
frosted moon tenkan a deer's I don't
have a question just felt like donating
you the man thank you festive in you the
man
Alex longed long good night long night
$10 love both yoga's videos question any
idea on what sides are speed
DVR for megahertz I could safely without
anything blowing up achieved with an i7
8700 K with an Asus the C 370 a mojo I'm
sure he meant mobile I don't think you
need to worry about what Ram speeds will
potentially blow up your system I think
with Intel memory speed doesn't matter
white as much as it does with Rison yeah
so don't spend too much more money if
it's like 5 maybe 10 bucks extra to buy
like the way faster kit go for it but
don't spend like anything more than that
your sweet spot that I would aim for be
as sick a 16 gig
3200 speed memory yeah in that range
yeah but if you if you have to settle
for like 29 33 or something your
performance isn't really gonna matter
it's not gonna change much if you can
save 20 bucks from it then I would say
go for that but yeah thank you very much
for the duration Alex and Roush wire
five Canadians a guys was wondering if
you could help my RAM has been stable at
29 33 XMP but destiny to softlocks then
fully freezes how can I fix that timings
I'm curious as to whether or not your
memories overclocked at 29 Oh does he
mean it's stock if he if he says XMP
afterwards not necessarily right I'm
wondering if he's running it using XMP
values then it's supposed to run 29 33
right let's put a sugar on that then
maybe your CPU is overclocked then it's
unstable unstable it's also also just
one of those things with overclocks that
kind of sucks sometimes is you can do
something that is because technically
29:33 even if your memory is rated for
that that's still an overclock because
the actual rated speeds for I think
you're on Rison are 2400 I believe 21 33
and 2400 first gen yeah yeah depending
on what generation you have in stuff so
you know it's not guaranteed to work so
you can be stable in 90% of the stuffs
that you do but then you can have that
one thing that you sure that that locks
up if it's consistent then yeah it's
probably something to do with your
overclock update your bios loosening up
your timings could be a way to
potentially deal with that true you know
just back them off by a point or two at
a time and see if it
situation repeats itself yeah other than
that you know you might have to you
might have to set up a new a secondary
BIOS setting that you switch to when you
play destiny - specifically sure
annoying as that might be and and if
you're really trying to get to the
bottom of you really don't know what's
causing that crash then I would run
everything stock and then start
overclocking one component at a time
yeah up overclock your cpu and then play
for a week if nothing happens then you
know it's not your CPU overclock also
and you just keep going
Andrew I think one of these packages
back here is from you we're doing male
time time on my half noise so stick
around for that okay Louise bonus gusano
circa $5 when should we expect next gen
of i7 intel chips should I upgrade from
a 7700 K to an 87 hundred K or should I
wait I would say wait and you should be
expecting the next wave of intel core
CPUs to be this month if the rumors are
true as we mentioned earlier on the show
seems like in the next month or two
yeah yeah so I I would I would go for an
8 core if you're if you're gonna upgrade
if you're really set on upgrading how
the latest and greatest I would say from
a 7700 K go with like the 9900 K or
whatever it's called the i9 get some 8
core action in there if you're sticking
to Intel but don't bother upgrading to
an 80 700 K wait till the next gen exact
times that ya pages contain just a -
this I know is cooling an are 1600 on an
X 370 I think he meant rise in 16 oh
yeah rise in 1600 on an x3 70 gigabyte
gaining 3 with a 1080 3,000 megahertz
ram which processor would you recommend
risin 560 very much cooler
does it says he's cooling of our 1600
which I assume means a rise in the 1600
let's read that he said x3 seventies
motherboard the GTX tennety okay you're
talking about okay I think he means what
cooler because it says cooling instead
sits coolly
yeah okay but cooler would you recommend
I mean there's so many good budget
options I would say stick with air you
don't need liquid for a rise of five
chip the the cry Rick h7 that Paul
mentioned earlier is a good is a good
option that looks nice too if you have
like a tempered glass side panel or
something like that you don't need to
get the quad bloomie though that's a
little bit more expensive you want the
RGB you can just get the regular h7
looks really good nice appoint and stuff
cooler master also has some pretty good
budget options huh
you can go I don't know
raising five chip doesn't really need
that much cooling you probably have a 65
watt TVP chip if I'm guessing oh yeah
you do if it's a 1600 nother six in
their next so yeah I would say get not
cool aura you twelve escrow max get the
cooler you think look is good and has
good reviews so frozen durian recommends
that that's probably a good choice
budget reviews and aesthetics look at
those three things and decide what's
good for you because there are so many
options
wishbone five dollars no liquid metal on
your $10,000 PC d lid thread thread
Ripper etc and on your GPUs there is
actually liquid metal on the 70 979 ATX
e in my $10,000 PC unless she's talking
to you Paul wait this might be my second
no liquid metal on your $10,000 PC
dealin thread Ripper etcetera and on
your GPUs oh I think he's talking to you
because you just had a you've been
working on Riptide turns about turner
Part D lighting is really fairly
pointless there Bauer has kind of shown
that I mean
yes there's some small benefit to be
achieved and that net not really
GPUs I did aftermarket coolers on liquid
metal is all right look if it's speaking
practically honestly I don't have any
liquid metal here I did not have any
level to put on so that wasn't even like
an option that arose needs more liquid
metal and it wasn't an important enough
thing for me to arrange before hands
you're not gonna need it to get because
I copy us I could just order some liquid
metal or something like that honestly
for me it was a long-term usage
situation so that's sort of came down to
for me if you're talking about arctic
panther arctic panther has a deal it in
79 60 X in it
and that I just used some coolermaster
nano fluid because upgrading the thermal
paste still gives them improved
performance going to look of metal gives
more improved performance but it also
introduces the possibility of like
applying it wrong you know because it's
conductive in certain areas and so I
just opted to go with the thermal paste
because I want to make sure that if I do
end up running it for a couple years I'm
not concerned about long-term use good
so that's that's really what a conductor
thank you very much we spoon Johnny wool
in $99.98 did shut up Baldwin's did you
sighs you said Charlie's Zubin and what
nay stood I mean um that's something I
just love to do my half of the show so
hurry up cat sure yeah two more what's
up guys how do you feel about mixing
brands within a built for example a
motherboard and GPU doesn't matter don't
care it's totally fine totally fine the
only the only time I would specifically
say stick to the same brand and so if
you're really concerned about lighting
oh and you want to make sure that like
your graphics card lights and your
motherboard lights can all be synced up
with the same application even in that
situation there's some like like there's
there's the companies that don't make
motherboards and GPUs that still make
the software like NZXT or Corsair or
Coolermaster for example that can still
sometimes take control of those even if
you have disparate brands for those
products but that's the only time I
would say yeah make sure other than that
it doesn't matter you can mix and match
yeah Aventis ten dollars will my build
last for the next few years or do I need
to upgrade with a PCI card click there
list calico no malware coming in here
wait I typed it into the URL and it does
the fantasies
travel boom and boom any problems with
what Lewis's question
Oh will my build lasts for the next few
years 7700 K I would wait and see what
the ninth gen core processors have to
offer this month before you pull the
trigger on that and a
GT X 1080 yes that will last you a long
time
absolutely app so freely wow you have a
lot of SST severe why do you have four X
s DS gotta have the storage alright sure
I mean 10 terabytes of SSD story alright
cool
yeah I think your your GPU is great
there might be a new GPU around the
corner soon I don't know
and then CPU yeah you can get more than
four cores and eight threads easily Jana
keep should hold out for the ninth gen
that's gonna do it for my half of the
show people know it's not how this
Johnson's really quick dammit I have one
Johnson yeah don't we all
be ready for my Johnson ready for you
Johnson's for bearded axe Thank You
bearded actor got a two glass English
pub glass sets these same glasses that
we're drinking from today they're really
good noise they're really good for
drinking no no no no no II uh you can
drink fluid out of them bitter Dex gets
a double Johnson so just be awesome
hardware a swordfight black tri-blend
t-shirt thank you very much that was the
only Johnson I have to Correa's have one
Johnson and keep it as God is attending
so that's gonna do it for my half guys
don't go anywhere
Paul's half is about to start you come
in there stay where you are on Twitch or
if you're watching on YouTube follow the
link in my description and feel free to
do timestamps for my half that would be
much appreciated I'll pinion and stuff
it'll be great we'll have the party and
also I'm gonna be and we're gonna be at
Comic Con this weekend if you're gonna
be at Comic Con we we're gonna have a
fan meetup on Saturday at 4 o'clock
