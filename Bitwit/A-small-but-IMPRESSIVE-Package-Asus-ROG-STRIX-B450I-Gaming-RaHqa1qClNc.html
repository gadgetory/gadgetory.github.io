their B 450 platform with a whole lineup
of v4 50 motherboards one of which we'll
be taking a look at today this is the
asus rog Strix B 450 eye gaming it's a
mini ITX board it's actually the first
and only be 450 board I've received here
in the studio which is why we're taking
a look at it I didn't really have meant
many other options at this point but
it's a cool little board oh let me hold
on plastic wrap plastic wrap alert one
sec oh oh it broke in half so you guys
even get a double feature here so it's
always a little one the little ones are
always the best the corsair k70 RGB mark
2 features a variety of genuine Cherry
MX switches vibrant customizable RGB
backlighting and a solid aluminum frame
built to last
enjoy features such as USB pass-through
multimedia controls windows lock key and
more available in black or white and
silver click the link below for more
info now that I have your attention
B 450 is 2 X 470 SB 350 was 2 X 370 so
this is basically a much cheaper
alternative with a lot of the same
features that you'll find on the
higher-end rise in support of other
boards so that's exciting
now since the p450 platform is the focus
for today's video I wanted to quickly
highlight some of the differences
between this platform and X 470 as well
as be 350 its predecessor before we dive
into the board itself so for starters I
would say X 470 is really reserved for
people who are our users who are trying
to hit the highest possible overclocks
they're generally a bit more over
engineered than B 450 or B 350 so if
you're trying to break some world
records or you're just trying to milk
every ounce of performance out of your
CPU then I would suggest going X 470 if
you're spending you know $300 plus on a
CPU you probably don't mind spending
another 50 to $100 on a motherboard that
has greater overclocking capabilities
additionally multi-gpu support is
available on x4 70 but that's not the
case on b4 50 you only get one by 16
support here whereas you get one by 16
and 2 by 8 support on x4 70 so if you
drop a second card in there can split
the PCIe lanes and you can take
advantage of SLI or crossfire
considering that most users these days
are just dropping a single graphics card
into their system
and SLI and crossfire aren't even really
being advertised much by the chip makers
these days this isn't a huge deal for
most people so it's really just for if
you're trying to go balls to the wall
you again trying to squeeze every last
bit of performance out of your board
then you're probably gonna want to avoid
be 450 and opt for the more expensive
platform x4 70 also has a smidge more
i/o connectivity than its be 450
counterpart in the way of USB 3.1 gen2
on and it has a few more PCIe lanes both
Gen 2 and Gen 3 most users are going to
be totally fine with the amount of i/o
that supported onboard beat on board on
B 450 if you have specific needs as a
user then you might need that extra i/o
then you're gonna want to opt for X 470
now moving on to the differences between
B 450 and B 350 I mean for starters you
get support for faster memory speeds
with these newer boards and that's
actually really important with Rison of
course because of the Infinity fabric
and how dependent it is on memory
frequency so so that's a huge feature
improved memory controller faster memory
speeds over all the other main benefits
of B 450 over its predecessor are mostly
software based things like PBO or
precision boost overdrive and store my
PBO is very similar to XO far and
precision boost 2 but it essentially
looks at the vrm usage on your
motherboard and if there's additional
headroom there and provided that your
cooling is in check it'll just send more
juice to your CPU and basically boost up
the frequencies on any number of course
it works very dynamically so if you're
using if you're running a lightly
threaded workload it might only boost
one or two cores and that way it'll
actually be able to hit higher
frequencies whereas if you have a
heavily multi-threaded workload or
you're gaming in a title that utilizes a
bunch of cores then it'll scale all the
cores up as long as there's that vrm
headroom so it's actually a pretty cool
technology it's been announced for a
while now but it hasn't been super
active or usable it probably will
relatively soon it's a future feature or
whatever the other thing is store em I
store my basically takes two drives
presumably one hard drive with a large
capacity and an SSD with a smaller
capacity pairs them together it shows up
as a single drive in your OS and it
basically dynamically chooses which
files
stored on which drives depending on how
frequently you use those files so it's
it sounds a lot like SSD caching but
it's definitely not the technologies
enterprise level and it's been around
for a while now it works differently in
that sense than the Nestea caching but
the end result is kind of the same you
get a snappier and superior system
faster operation all that sort of thing
the other great thing about it is that
you can you can basically install it or
set it up before or after OS
installation so that's really nice for
and flexible for users who have an
existing system and don't want to deal
with all the fuss of trying to transfer
over their OS or doing a clean install
or something like that so now that we've
briefly distinguished v4 50 from x4 70
and B 350 let's take a closer look at
the motherboard right off the bat I
gotta say it's a pretty handsome looking
board very typical of what you defined
with the ROG boards these days with
those sort of silverish grayish charcoal
looking aluminum heat sinks we've got a
fat one over the vrm and it looks like
there's one over the where one of the m2
slots is we'll get to that in just a bit
but very color neutral it does have some
aura sink lighting I believe on the m2
cover here so overall very attractive so
a m4 socket of course fully backwards
compatible I should have mentioned that
earlier with first generation CPUs even
supports you know precision boost to and
exif r2 assuming you drop like a 2nd gen
rise in cpu in here so that's pretty
cool flanking the a m4 socket you get
your obligatory pair of ddr4 dimm slots
at the top of the board you'll find to
RGB headers once a four pin and one's a
three pin so you get your choice of not
addressable or addressable support
therefore your LED strips and devices
there are one two three fan headers four
pin PWM fan headers that support you
know a iOS and pumps and things like
that and if we're talking about the BRM
since we're here it looks like you've
got six phase power for your for your VR
M going to your CPU and then one phase
power for your SOC so the overall BRM
going to your CPU is pretty solid six
phases on a mini ITX board I'm digging
that the one phase on the SOC is a
little concerning I guess what this
tells us is that use caution if you're
gonna drop a raven Ridge apu in here
because the SOC on Rison powers the eye
bu or the Vega graphics that are a part
of the horizon APU so maybe you wouldn't
get the best overclocking potential if
you were to drop an APU in here but if
you're just dropping you know normal CPU
in here you should be good to go
with some decent overclocking
additionally we've got an arrangement of
SATA ports so we've got two SATA ports
on the right side of the board and then
two more just above the right side of
the PCI Express slot which I don't know
that seems like it might pose some cable
routing issues if you are gonna use
those ports they're just at a really
awkward spot and they're a little bit
more inland on the PCB than than usual
you've also got USB 3 which seems to be
in a good spot on the the bottom right
corner of the board along with USB 2 a
single USB 2 header at the very bottom
you've got your PCI Express gen3 by 16
slots
looking pretty with some some aluminum
or metal reinforcements I should say and
then there's this this this thing what
looks to be an MDOT two shield or or
heatsink which I guess we should pop off
really quick and take a closer look
because this is quite interesting so
definitely a heat sink for your MDOT to
drive nvme supported PCI Express gen3 by
four and all that so there is a thermal
pad included with a little sticker on
there you removed before you apply it
and then we've also got our slot here so
the slot is kind of raised up that's
because underneath it is a heatsink for
the for what I believe is the chipset so
I think that's the chipset heatsink
underneath there so they've kind of
stacked or layered different componentry
on top of each other to save space on
this very space constricted board which
i think is smart this has also got audio
built into this little area so not only
is it I'm about to board but there's a
there's audio at the back as well and
it's got LED enhancement or whatever so
it shines you know lights up red blue
and green to let you know what inputs
they are just because you're really
fancy and stuff you got 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
alongside an Intel gigabit nic 2 USB 3.1
gen2 ports type-a as well as 4 USB 3.1
gen2 also type-a and finally there's an
HDMI out with HDR support so if you were
to drop an APU in here and you had an
HDR supported monitor first of all lucky
you you'd be able to take advantage of
that high dynamic range capability so
that's
pretty cool the other thing that I want
to show you is the back of the board
got a little backplate here but there's
another m2 slot look at that just right
there on the back this one's just kind
of flat with the PCB but this board
allows you to actually raid nvme drives
nvme MDOT two drives together which is
really sweet
of course this is gonna be limited to a
very small number of users I would
imagine but it's kind of cool that you
can do that on a mini ITX board so
there's a quick gander at the board at
this point I'd like to actually get it
booted with our Rison 520 600 X and try
my hand at some overclocking just to see
what the experience and various
behaviors are and then we'll circle back
and talk about it so be right back
alright so I just spent the last hour or
two setting up our test bed quite
haphazardly I might add but it's
functional and the results are pretty
good you guys are gonna enjoy it but
before we get into that let me quickly
go over the hardware that I used here I
didn't want cooling to be a limiting
factor on our resin 5 2600 X which is
again 6 cores 12 threads so we have a
cooler master master liquid ml 240 RGB
as you can see I did not use any of the
RGB because it's pointless and then we
also have a pretty fast memory kit from
g-scale this is their sniper X ddr4 at
3400 speed which we were able to hit no
problem and we also have a fractal
design Integra 550 650 watt power supply
and a gtx 1050 TI from msi this is
simply so that we can have a video
output and see what we're doing so all
together we were able to achieve a 4.2
gigahertz overclock on all cores and
that was at one point three seven five
volts within the UEFI that was the first
and last voltage value that I that I
attempted it just worked I haven't I
don't have that much experience
overclocking the 2600 X specifically but
the temperatures are even fine in case
you're curious it just hit 69 woo but
it's mostly been within the 60s and 70s
we're running rock-solid stable right
now approaching half an hour in a 264 or
I 264 I would suggest that if you're
overclocking and you're gonna run that
overclock regularly perhaps on a daily
basis that you I definitely spend more
than half an hour stress testing your
CPU to ensure that your your overclocks
rock-solid stable but for the purpose of
this vid
in the interest of time things are
looking really really good it's really
nice that we were able to hit 4.2
gigahertz because I've seen most users
kind of maxed out at that frequency
when overclocking their 2600 X's so it's
nice to know that we can actually hit
that on a be 450 motherboard Mini ITX
nonetheless additionally I would say
that this is probably this board is
probably the better value over the x 470
equivalent because they seem pretty much
exactly the same except for the chipset
so unless you really need that extra i/o
with you know USB 3.1 gen2 and maybe a
couple extra PCIe lanes which I don't
think you would in most cases you can't
really utilize multi-gpu configurations
at all on mini ATX anyway so X 470
doesn't seem to make as much sense in
this case but those are my findings on
the Asus as note the Asus has rocked the
eighth the asus rog Strix B 450 I gaming
guys let me know what you think about
this board what you think about the B
450 platform as a whole and feel free to
toss a like on this video if you enjoyed
it you can also get subscribed for more
tech videos coming at you really soon
and you can check me out on floatplane
if you want to watch my videos a week
early without ads for 3 bucks a month
I'll put a link for that in the video
description as always guys thank you for
tuning in have a good one and I'll see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
