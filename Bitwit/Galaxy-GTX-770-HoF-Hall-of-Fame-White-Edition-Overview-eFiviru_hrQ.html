awesomesauce news here to bring you
another wonderful overview of this video
card from galaxy this is their gtx 770
hall of fame edition and what's really
cool about it aside from some of the
tweaked up features and specifications
that they've amped up on this guy is
that it's all white it's it speared it
retains its innocence in the video card
Kingdom and it's just it looks like a
it's a badass looking card it's what it
is
so I'm gonna show you a little bit of
that closer up in just a bit but first
let's just get right down to the meat of
this card so it does feature the GK 104
GPU which we are all pretty familiar
with I would assume it does feature a
lot of these same supportive
technologies that you get on the
reference design including GPU boost 2.0
as with any card in the 700 series from
Nvidia you also get 3d vision surround
CUDA DirectX 11 physics TxAA
adaptive vsync VFX AAA and it is also it
also does support SLI so you can go to
or 3-way SLI with this card and it is
also shield ready so if you guys happen
to pick up Nvidia shield in the past
couple months you can rest assure that
you can directly stream any games or
media from your PC directly to that
Android device now there are definitely
some specs here that set this card apart
from the reference gtx 770 so i'm going
to go over those specs first and then
i'll follow with all the specs that do
fall in line with the reference design
so the first off right off the bat but
probably the most obvious difference
between this card and the reference is
the cooler and the cooler is just wicked
looking it just it's one of the coolest
looking coolers i've ever seen and I
said cooler twice in different ways but
I'm gonna take a closer look at that in
just a bit so the other spec that I
didn't want to point out that is very
different from the reference design is
the base and boost clock of this card
galaxy has definitely cranked it up on
this one I think I remember the
reference base and boost clock for the
well the reference design of course is
1046 megahertz for the base and 1085
megahertz for the boost clock now Galaxy
has said screw that we're gonna push
this guy as far as it can go well almost
as far as it can go and they cranked it
up about 15% as far as the base clock
goes it's now running at 1200 and 2
megahertz right out of the box and it
has a boost clock of twelve hundred and
fifty four that is a massive increase
and I'm pretty sure you can push that
even further if you wanted to go in
there and manually tweak it
so that's that's that's pretty badass
that definitely makes this card a bit of
a powerhouse over the standard reference
design also differentiating from the
reference card is the the actual
physical size of it so we went from 10.5
but the reference to eleven point seven
inches with this with this design and
that is significantly larger I would say
because it's you're almost hitting 12
inches there you want to definitely make
sure that your chassis has enough room
in it comfortably to fit this card so
make sure that you check that out before
you pull the trigger on this guy and you
also get a different specification as
far as power connectivity so PCIe power
connectors we've got two eight pins on
this guy as opposed to one eight pin and
one six pin on the reference design but
keep in mind that also means about 75
well exactly 75 watts more power to your
card and that basically breaks down to
better and more stable overclocking you
can hit higher numbers with more wattage
of course and the last spec that I could
find that was different from the
reference design are the video outputs
on the card so you've got three mini
HDMI and one DisplayPort on the hall of
fame' design as opposed to two dual link
DVI ports one HDMI and one DisplayPort
on the back of the reference but that
pretty much sums it up for all of the
specs that are different from the
reference design everything else is
pretty much the same all the memory
specs memory speed at seven gigabits per
second this card does have a two gig
frame buffer of gddr5 on a 256-bit
memory interface and it does have a
memory bandwidth of 224 point three
gigabytes per second aside from that it
does have the same TDP as well as the
reference design of 230 watts and they
are recommending at least a minimum of
600 watts for your power supply now that
I've said that I'm gonna take it over to
Kyle for a close-up look of the card
thank you kindly mr. Kyle and before I
get into the hardware specifications of
this particular card there's one thing
that Kyle forgot to mention in the last
clip and that is just like the GTX 770
this card 2 is also capable of
delivering up to 4 displays on a single
card so you can have 3 monitors that you
can gain from simultaneously and you can
also have 1/4 display a companion
monitor from so to speak that you can
just do web browsing voice chat or
whatever you so desire so I just wanted
to point that out and let's let's move
on to the cooler itself now because it
is quite stunning it is
all white as you can see well I wouldn't
say all white in the purest sense but it
does have some black accents and does a
good job of incorporating some really
nice effects that you don't see on too
many cards which I'm going to show you
in just a bit
but here it is you have 380 centimeter
80 millimeter fans maybe some of your
fans that would be some serious cooling
there they are very nice-looking they
kind of have a sharp a sharp appeal to
them which I actually particularly like
and there's a massive aluminum heatsink
just below it you can see the spinner
ray just kind of extends throughout the
entire length of the card all the way to
the very end so you've got it's not it's
not the thickest radiator in fact it's
probably only a single slot width but it
is extremely long 11.7 inches of this
stuff should prove to do some decent
thermal dissipation when the time comes
so you've also got five copper heat
pipes right there they are nickel plated
and it to me according to my eyeballing
skills it looks like they are about six
millimeters in diameter if I'm not
mistaken you do have some GeForce GTX
780 R and that black strip kind of
extends and bleeds over to the front of
the card which also looks very nice has
kind of a silver accent all across the
front here you've also got more gtx 770
and you'll also notice this really thin
white line that kind of extends across
the entire face of this card and there's
basically an LED behind it a white LED
that will light up in pulse when this
guy's plugged in and powered on it gives
a really nice cool breathing effect and
it looks really awesome especially when
it's it's dim and low light you can see
it a lot better
you've got your 2 8 pin power connectors
which I already showed you but there
they are again since we're here and
check this out guys
this is what really ties all of this
card together is this fully white PCB
this is this is the real moneymaker here
and and quite frankly this is pretty
much what you're gonna be seeing most of
the time when your graphics card is
plugged in to most standard chassis
these days so I thought it was really
important I thought it was a really nice
touch and very important that galaxy
made this PCB white if they wanted to be
calling this card an all-white model so
good job galaxy you get a pat on the
back for that it does look very nice
there's your PCI Express gen3 slot of
course and lastly I know we already
looked at this earlier but
is another close-up look of your video
outs if this camera will ever focus wait
let me touch the screen and make it
focus there we go so there's our three
mini HDMI ports as well as your display
ports and some pretty useless
ventilation quite frankly just because
it's not adjacent to the heat the
thinner egg whatsoever it's just kind of
next to this fan so not sure how
effective or functional that ventilation
is there but there you have it that
pretty much sums up all the hardware
things that I want to talk about on this
card so lastly why don't we take it over
to the included accessories alright so
first we've got a little paper that says
attention customers basically telling
you to register your card with galaxy on
their website so you can take advantage
of their extended warranty you got to do
that 30 days within the time you
purchase the card so be diligent about
that they've also given you a Do Not
Disturb sign so whether you're
overclocking or gaming you can tell your
mom or your little brother to go away
because you're busy you're either you
know whether you're in progress or under
progress that whatever I'll go with it
and you've also got this nice little
paper cutout thing you basically just
punch it out and follow the instructions
connect the dots pretty much and you'll
end up with this little 3d paper figure
guy it was kind of funny because I
actually saw this thing standing on
somebody's desk at work and I had no
idea what it was or that it was really
related to galaxy in any way and then I
opened up this box and look at oh oh now
I'm connected the dots you see what I
did there
I also got a few adapters here you've
got some molex to eight pin PCI Express
power connectors sorry about that I
needed to focus for a second so here we
have a mini HDMI to regular HDMI adapter
and you've also got a DVI to HDMI I know
it's really hard to see through this
horrible plastic but there it is and
lastly we've got your user's manual
which is pretty vague in general
actually they don't even have the actual
hall-of-fame card represented in the
diagram it's just the reference gtx 770
so not all this information may be
applicable but if you're a beginner
you're new to this stuff this might come
in handy for most give you out there you
probably won't need it and lastly you
have your installation CD for your
drivers you've also got some software on
here some tweaking and tuning software
that Galaxies provided which I've heard
is actually pretty decent and look at
that even the CD is white geez these
guys are good but there you go it's
always best to go to the nvidia website
to ensure
you have the latest drivers and that is
it for accessories alright ladies and
gentlemen that is going to do it for
this overview once again this has been
galaxy's gtx 770 hall of fame all-white
edition if you guys enjoyed the video
please subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and like my main man
lino so he says like the video if you
liked it dislike it if you dislike it
