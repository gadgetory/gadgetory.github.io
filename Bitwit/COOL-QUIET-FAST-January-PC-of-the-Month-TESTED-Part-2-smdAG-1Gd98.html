channel today we're doing part two the
follow up video to part one of January's
PC of the month which is the beautiful
system that I have right next to me it's
already booted up you can see the BIOS
behind me on the screen everything's
working properly and today we're going
to be putting it through the wringer so
if you didn't catch part one where I
assemble the rig you can check that out
but this is where we actually put it to
the test and test everything from
thermals acoustics gaming performance
and overclocking the whole shebang so to
speak so should be interesting to find
out exactly what this machine is capable
of cuz we've got some pretty robust
Hardware in here including a core i7
7700 K and a GTX 1080 from EVGA their
hybrid variant featuring an a IO liquid
cooler on there and really quick and
want to point out that it's been 2 or 3
weeks since I put the system together
and just from an aesthetic standpoint I
couldn't be happier with how it turned
out I think it looks great I appreciate
the fact that it's not lined with RGB
LEDs for once and it has this really
subdued appearance yet still comes off
super aggressive so I really like it and
I think overall there's probably not a
single thing that I would change about
this system from a cosmetic standpoint I
mean apart from the the fractal venturi
fan not really matching the Corsair band
that's like it that's like a little
thing I mean you guys don't care I don't
care you know and the venturi the
venturi is are great fans they cool well
they're quiet they look nice and cares
if there's a glaring break in visual
continuity ok I did you know it looks
hideous I can't I can't do this
oh so much better okay we can continue
now and also you might have noticed that
I did change the LED on the motherboard
from orange to white through the issues
or software now we're looking super
cohesive everything's looking good and
we may now move forward so the first
thing I want to talk about since we just
swapped a fan out let's talk about fans
and what I did with those so we have
seven fans in total four of which are on
the X 62 radiator so these two right
here DML pros should have been detected
in the cam software because they're
directly connected to the a i/o water
block however I did not see them in cann
this could be a bug so these are just
kind of left in the hands of NZXT
whatever default configuration are
profiles of these fans run out run in
out of the box that's what we're running
today the other two fans which are
underneath the front panel of the m2 Pro
M here that you can't see those as well
as these two and the radiator fan on our
GT X 1080 a IO those are all configured
with custom fan curves that I've set
myself with in thermal radar - which is
a part of AI suite 3 the very lovely app
from Asus so those are all configured
and I kind of tailored them for a nice
balance between performance and
acoustics I didn't want to sway one way
or the other
too far so I kept it very balanced and
neutral so with the fans all handled I
decided to jump into the BIOS and start
overclocking our 7700 K I put a
multiplier of 50 which gave us of course
5 gigahertz and we were able to hit that
stable e at one point three seven five
volts which falls in line with a lot of
the other review websites out there I
also overclocked our GPU of course the
GTX 1080 was able to head 2063 megahertz
I believe at its max core clock
frequency once I dialed in a 110
megahertz offset on the core clock and a
300 megahertz offset on the memory clock
and after I put an expensive load on it
for a lengthier period of time we did
see the core clock frequency drop down
to 2,000 50 megahertz but it was still
very stable that entire time there were
no dips whatsoever so
that was all nice and dandy as far as
thermals are concerned the way I tested
that was in my room of 26 degrees
Celsius ambient and that was constant
throughout the test and we ran gta5
initially I was going to do huge in
heaven 4.0 but I just figured that was a
bit too GPU intensive and it didn't
really tax the CPU quite enough and I
didn't feel like it was going to give us
a really good representation of what a
real-world result would be for the
average gamer so I jumped into GTA 5 at
4k for about say about half an hour I
did about half an hour run not the pre
run benchmark I just started playing the
game so after half an hour run we
actually saw the CPU hit 76 degrees
Celsius as the max on the package which
is honestly fine by me if we're in the
mid 70s after overclocking a 77 100k to
5 gigahertz in a very CPU demanding game
like GTA 5 then I'm that rest well with
me as for our GP we had a max
temperature of 65 degrees Celsius which
is again very reasonable all things
considered when you're talking about an
overclocked $600 graphics card pushing
this many pixels is is very impressive
and I've had some experience with liquid
cooled AIO
GPUs in the past which have been sort of
lackluster to be honest so I wasn't
really sure what to expect with the EVGA
hybrid here but I can definitely tell
you it is very effective if you spend
the time to create a custom fan curve
for the one fan that's on there you can
get really great results so as most of
you guys know GTA 5 can be a total
memory hog when it comes to 4k gaming
especially if you have all the settings
cranked up and filters turned on and
things like that and sure enough we saw
over 6 Diggs of VRAM being eaten up but
what's even crazier is that throughout
my entire benchmark runs not just GTA 5
but all the benchmarks that I run for
these tests we saw nearly all eight gigs
of gddr5 X being used on this card which
is absolutely insane
the most VRAM usage that I've ever seen
personally in this office of mine and
I'm not exactly sure which test did that
obviously was something running at 4k
and not at a lower resolution in order
to be pushing that much but I wasn't
going to go ahead and like run all seven
benchmarks again just to see which one
it was but I think that's pretty crazy
hopefully we'll see some
in gigabyte cards in the near future
with the next generation of GPUs from
Nvidia and AMD because it looks like we
need it if we're going to be gaming at
these resolutions and and with all those
filters turned on now before we dive
into the gaming benchmarks I want to
quickly touch on acoustics here because
they are solid very solid acoustics
honestly this system has a nice trifecta
of raw gaming performance cooling
performance and noise levels I think
there's a nice balance where none of
those elements seems to fall too short
of the others which is really nice to
see and I think it's also a testament to
the mlpro fans that we have in here from
course they're doing a great job keeping
things cool but also quiet so on that
note I'll go ahead and let you guys hear
for yourself with a quick sound test
all right now the moment you've all been
waiting for gaming benchmarks of course
tested on Windows 10 64 bits as well as
the latest wickel driver from a new
video which is 3:07 no.37 8.6 6 in total
i ran seven different applications five
of which were triple-a games and those
were run at 1440p as well as 4k I threw
out 1080p altogether because honestly if
you have a system like this you should
not be gaming in 1920 by 1080 I'm sorry
that's just a slap in the face and you
shouldn't do it it's bad some of that
said ladies and gentlemen here are the
benchmarks for January's PC of them
alright y'all so there you have the
results very impressive numbers all
around and to be honest the GTX nad here
doesn't really handle 4k all that well
when you're dealing with triple-a titles
that are fully maxed out with msaa
enabled we didn't quite hit the 60fps
average threshold that we would have
liked to in many of the games only doom
and overwatch we're able to achieve that
overwatch being a less demanding title
to begin with however once we dial down
to 1440p this thing absolutely kicks ass
with very favorable frame rates doing
well above 60 in many cases so if you
have something like a G sync monitor
that's 1440p and that J sync range is
anywhere from 60 to 75 Hertz 100 Hertz
you're going to get a very very nice
gameplay experience with a system like
this for sure
we did see a bit of CPU bottlenecking
however in overwatch actually there was
only a few frames difference in our
average frame rates going from 1440p to
4k which meant the game is just so non
intensive of the GPUs able to render
frames quicker than the CPU can actually
write instructions for them so that was
a pretty much expected overwatch does
tend to see some CPU bottlenecking
because it is so well optimized for the
graphics card that sometimes the CPU
just can't keep up but overall just
outstanding results and you guys can let
me know what you think about them in the
comments below that's going to wrap it
