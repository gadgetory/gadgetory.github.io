now fat oh cool it's both yeah how
excellent welcome we never we never in
when we were never not live to twitch
well yeah but yeah you're right
and now we're sweet really yes hello hey
everybody welcome to awesome hardware
this is a live stream that Paul and I do
every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time right here on twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware we also stream
its to our YouTube channels our
respective YouTube channels my name is
usually Beckham /c / bit wit Paul's is
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardwick and
you can catch his half the show if you
haven't if you if you happen to miss it
you can find a link in my description
below if you're watching us on YouTube
or you can just go to his channel it'll
be rock layer and let's say we'd like to

you we will throttle your bandwidth for
this for this broadcast if you are not
constantly drinking alcohol during the
show alright we also have stores
polymers stories virus they would tech
slash store and I'm selling new things
like the awesome hardware shirt which
you can actually buy on either of our
stores we both split the profits
regardless of which store you buy it off
of but it's a great design that was
whipped up by our good friend and viewer
Brian maracas sucked he is known as on
the interwebs
um fantastic little homage paste some
homage to The Princess Bride
fantastic classic movie what are you
talking about Cal has nothing to do with
the Princess Bride and there's no way
you're right legally or otherwise a
representation there right or affiliated
you should be right forthwith
yeah you're or they're in your it's true
yeah I don't even know the princess
brightest but you look Kyle's like an
eagle Montoya and I'm like the Dread
Pirate Roberts
it's just pure coincidence awesome pure
coincidence so you can pick one of those
up I'm also selling female shirts and
hats and beanies and other
things goodies please honey hoodies are
really nice Paul is also selling stuff
on his store Paul hardware net including
the new bottle opener well it is uh it
has a nice thumb screw on it thumbscrews
logo I agree almost exactly like the one
that I have here the NVIDIA GeForce one
that I got it to CES few years back I
think no no I like this one so that
one's gonna be good too you're right no
it's a solid really good all-metal
bottle opener it's good for like you
know it's even good for like bottles III
use this all the time for screwing the
it's available as a set with the
kool-aid the Imperial glasses which are
very good for holding alcohol or other
types of liquid or drinking anyway that
most definitely thanks like guys who
support us by shopping on our stores yes
we will yell at you and yell your name
on stream at the end of this half of the
show if you happen to buy something from
either of our servers also quick
interjection and shameless plug if any
of you guys are like fans of Kyle's
channel but you've never actually seen
or heard of me hi I'm Paul Paul's
hardware is how often does that happen I
wonder how I don't know I feel like that
doesn't it that never happen occasion
but I'm giving away an insanely high end
computer right now yes with remain here
it's the main main gear are one razor
edition so check out my channel there is
an epic build it's it's a crazy bill
that's all completely water cooled
custom article ek water blocks and
everything there's also bits power
fittings cool ants quick disconnects
that - GTX 10 80s and SLI arise in 7
1800 X processor and MSI titanium
titanium X 370 and a razor age 440 H I'm
sorry an n ZX th 440 reason edition case
and a samsung 960 pro 512 gig and vm an
SSD as well as a I think it's a 2
terabyte hard drive in there -
it's really it's really nice and you get
in main here is also going to provide
warranty service to whoever the winner
is so register you'll get it and you can
register
and that way that actually provides
support for it and everything too so
yeah check it out
do it go enter and thanks to all you
guys who do free alright moving on
to tech news I'm going to keep my 1/2
relatively short we actually do have
sort of a meet-up that we're doing with
with a vendor with a rep believe it or
not at the end of this episode so I'm
gonna be efficient more or less but our
first article comes from the verge and
it's a very sad very sad news here Paul
is dead
Oh Paul no not this Paul sorry um Paul
Otto Lenny Oh - Lenny I don't know how
to pronounce it exactly but he was the
former Intel CEO Intel's former CEO dies
at 66 today very sad news he died in his
sleep at 66 years of age he spent over
40 years of his life as an Intel
employee that's crazy
he died at 66 and he spent 40 of those
years at intelligence Inc he was a v and
v CEO at the company followed by current
chief Bryan crews Anik right Britannic
rhymes with satanic no I'm making these
associational has nothing completely
unrelated though of course first Intel
CEO it's cos Enoch Cruz Danish Chris
Ange sorry that Cooper girl no no Lenny
though was the first Intel CEO who
didn't have any formal engineering
training whatsoever at least on paper
perhaps though he mighta is arguably one
of the most successful CEOs that the
company's ever had until generated more
revenue under his reign in his 8 year
tenure a CEO than it did during the
company's previous 45 years that's I
mean he was CEO during the tic-tock era
yeah when when AMD so Andy was actually
beating Intel when he took over in 2005
mm-hmm they they did the tick-tock thing
they did architecture die shrink every
other year right
and likes beat the pants off of AMD for
like a good I mean depending on when you
when you count them taking the lead back
as far as what AMD Adam what Intel had
you know a good a good eight years plus
of you know pretty much Intel dominance
up until horizon launched recently it's
crazy
yeah it says here the legacy it says
here that he took the company revenue
from or he took it to fifty three
billion dollars from the thirty four
billion dollar record before he started
so just within eight or so years just
many many billions he updated twenty
billion which is crazy uh he did have
some shortcomings however including you
know making ultrabooks sort of a
something that's stuck
I feel like ultrabooks have kind of
taken a backseat since then tried there
was so much marketing around ultrabooks
and it just never really took off
they're a bit underpowered and a little
overpriced but for what they were but
the other the other shortcoming or
misfire that uh Delaney had was until
failure to seize any of the smartphone
market share the mobile era was kind of
there for the taking um smartphones were
utilizing or using any Intel CPUs and
Intel kind of had this opportunity to go
for it and Otellini said no no and
that's one of his biggest professional
regrets was not going with his gut
instinct to to actually take on the
smartphone market but still he did make
some pretty mad gains for Intel and we
thank him for his service here in the PC
master-race
so may he rest in peace rest in peace
Paul rip also rip Tom Petty and Tom
Petty as well who probably didn't do as
much for the PC master-race but
definitely for into the great way to all
of our all of our souls yes
may they be remembered forever alright
moving on I'm Samsung Samsung Odyssey
which is a Windows VR headset or a mr
headset mixed reality who has some
leading specs and it was leaked recently
confirmed on Microsoft's website
this product does exist it's not just a
hoax along with some pretty juicy
details indicating that this might be
the pretty much the best like spec wise
the best VR headset on Windows there's a
definitely a bunch of other competitors
right now from Acer Asus other people
Samsung has iterated upon Microsoft's
reference design of this hmd and it
looks like the best option so far why is
it so good what what kind of specs does
this have well it includes motion
controllers for one which is pretty nice
it has integrated audio which is the
which makes it the only one in its class
to do so I think all the other ones you
need your own headphones which you know
some people might argue like that's
better because you can bring your own
audio you know sound experience have
your own favorite pair of cans or
whatever but I personally think for an
hmd it's such a pain in the ass to have
a separate unit for audio for sound so
it's integrated here if you look at the
picture it looks like there's AKG
branding on the side of little ear cups
there so EKGs very well known audio
brand they've given me a lot of oral
pleasure in the past lots of oral
pleasure deed Paul resolution on this
thing is pretty sweet too stole it I was
like where did the bottle opener you
stole is mine you may borrow it
temporarily stole it dicks resolution
per I 1440 by 1600 that's pretty good
but that demolishes what the rift and
vibe are doing at 1080 by 1200 and it's
slightly edging out the other windows VR
HMDs
so definitely best in this class there
as well also a lot of these HMDs are
using LCD displays Samsung of course is
stepping it up with an OLED display Hey
that's it's gonna give you a better
color reproduction and low persistence
performance which I didn't do enough
research to really know what that means
low persistence performance seems like
it
did it it's really performs it
persistence
it really is performing assistance of
time when it comes again Salvador Dali
reference I don't know somebody in chat
will know somebody in checked tell us a
110 degree field of view compared to 95
degrees on most of its competitors has I
PD just adjustment which is
interpupillary distance sorry the
distance between the lenses right some
people look like sloths and they got
like one eye on one side of their head
another I look like a hammerhead shark
yeah and others look like you know
cross-eyed is a spook so like chihuahuas
versus muffins well sent 500 dollars
from the complete package this competes
directly with oculus rift because the
rift was also just recently dropped to
500 bucks which is awkward because the
companies once collaborated on Samsung's
gear VR Samsung made the HMD but was
using oculus as platform to you know run
all the games and stuff so might make
the relationship a bit tainted but we'll
have to see what exactly goes down when
this hmd hits the market there was no
estimate as to when that might be though
so I keep an eye out for it let's move
on to our next article here coffee like
coffee like scarcity under there
potentially for a lot of interested
buyers this is a actually a reddit post
from users it is a truce through who
actually came across a sweet clockers
article and he translated himself he has
26,000 karma and he joined reddit on
August 14th 2012 hella karma bruh so
yeah that s you know validates is gonna
translate the sweet clockers page street
cred so he's gonna Paul's gonna
translate it this guy already translated
a bit and basically said that coffee
lake was intended to launch in 2018 and
Intel pushed it obviously to October of
this year actually this week Loki
you really sort of compete with Verizon
after AMD launched the rise in CPU
family so yeah they moved it up several
months but there could be some backlash
to this rushing of a launch where people
are saying sources are telling sweet
clockers that there might be a huge
scarcity of coffee like CPUs until 2018
so even though there's gonna be a hard
launch soon in 2017 we might not
actually have decent availability till
several months from now which is kind of
concerning if you were interested in
upgrading to the new platform Swedish
retailers are claiming that calculate
availability will be low on launch day
as they've only received a handful of
units I don't know how first of all
valid all this information is and how
widespread this applies to the rest of
us if it's just a you know the Swedish
area or if it you know whatever so one
source is saying that no Nordic
distributor has received an unlocked SKU
and that sales launch will begin with
lock chips which is kind of crazy so um
that would suck you were also planning
to buy like the Z 370 motherboard that
you know cost a little bit more so that
you can take advantage of overclocking
and stuff like that but you won't have a
case q chip on launch day that's kind of
a bummer availability will be dry until
mid December at the earliest but no one
is guaranteeing wide availability until
the year's end and the article goes on
to say that if this is the case it seems
like Intel's in a way pull on the
Kamikaze they're kind of shooting their
self in the foot because by the time
they actually do have decent
availability with coffee lake in January
let's say well Andy is already going to
be readying their second generation of
rising CPUs come February which is just
a month away so it seems like you know
Intel by Intel rushing or launched ahead
of schedule they're also gonna be late
to the party or one step behind for the
next launch if that makes sense and so
there it was kind of like this staggered
launch date now what are the Russians
have to do with this
sure that they're probably guilty though
whatever it is it's probably their fault
and they've all conspired against me so
intel has allocated most of their stock
of high-performance 8th gen processors
to Russia rather than these Nordic
countries which i think is a little
short-sighted at least according to what
Kyle just said I am NOT gonna say
anything about Russia because I I fear
them I don't want them to hack into my
brain what if they already have
that would explain why I'm not saying
anything bad about them quick beard
kill the brain cells well if they have
it's probably for the best
alright let's move on shall we yes
hell's from 500 like doing a volcano
they just open it no it's been open I
just took a swig and I put it down
gently you know did you get did you did
you did it go straight on the table like
that
no put it down like any other bottle
would I think maybe I pulled the don't
do it okay
Jesus what I thought that's service that
I thought you had accidentally caused no
I did not do anything like that
I did not slam it chesed you slam lying
lying no no I you they're gonna clip it
I did not bigger Kyle's lenses beer you
clipped that slam I want to see that
slam up close all right I want out the
proofs show me myself so way too cool
sending a statement for did you clip
that slab you clip me like that's like
sounds really cool a lot of interesting
verbs going on alright let's move on to
our next story here gigabytes is
releasing an RX Vega 64 hours gaming OC
card because photos have emerged which
means it's all true this is from video
cards calm they said they were gonna do
that I know original route whoa these
were rumors originally that gigabyte was
only gonna released a Vega 56 look at
can beginning of see it can work into a
note there's your solder just overlaying
two images Paul to show how much larger
it may potentially be than a reference
Vega of d6 card
I see which nice looks good I mean it
looks I'm glad that it's bigger bigger
means bigger fans more cooling bigger
heat sinks more heat pipes to cool this
mother-effer that is our X Vega because
holy that can get hot
sometimes especially in those reference
cards so this does look like a custom
PCB even though we're still rocking
those
you eat pin power plugs non-standard
display outputs that have been put onto
this card three HDMI and three
DisplayPort no DVI whatsoever
they've opted out of that this time
around you can see there's a dual fan
design I want to say those are 90
millimeter perhaps maybe a hundred
millimeter fans it's a fairly large card
from the looks of it if that scaling is
right compared to reference designs so I
feel like they can get away with 100 100
110 I mean I'd say a hundred hundred
millimeter fans to be to be safe and
it's a semi-open shroud so you know
you're gonna have some air ejecting
around the card not just from the rear
which you should take into consideration
if using one of these in a future bill
and the only complaint I really have
here is why are they still putting
orange on these perfectly black cards
seem to get away from the orange they
just can't let go of the orange
gigabytes let's solve the ordens maybe
that's the same here's the thing they do
it for their motherboards their
motherboards look great s'en they can be
perfectly black in color neutral what
what what are you doing now this is a
big one Paul will you call this one the
Paul sighs whoa you're getting really
close to that camera it is a reason to
get into 3d streaming 3d fun with
streaming balloon animals Paul what are
you gonna make
that's what are you making something for
you for me ah see how does how does
anyone enjoy that balloons are terrible
does that really were you injured did
that hurt you it hurt my ears
headphone users did it hurt your ears I
was wearing headphones it would have it
would hurt me those great headphones
fall deserts
new Sam Boyd have a compressor on it I
had no idea I didn't even look I was
just like okay it's got it's got an XLR
bus my port and it is buddy because
money and look it's got a USB a USB port
I don't care if it's got a compressor
what does that even mean because the
compressor is the exact thing that's
needed in order to prevent speaking when
we get we get left I don't know I know
what for the email say paid for that
sound board it better have damn
compressor like 200 bucks no does not
sound like there's a compressor so the
clipping is gone gotten out of hand
you've all gone mad with your clipping
no I'm wonder if there are professional
Clippers wait what happened leak yeah is
that from you balloon um
like sometimes quality of the latex is
is very important like it's like look at
this blue knowledge being dropped on all
of us right now okay you look what
you're doing you're twisting around and
straight a lot like if it's crappy latex
then it's gonna pop so what happens it's
very like straightforward sensible
information but how many of us are
fondling you know latex objects on a
regular basis I'd say good at least half
of our audience must not only drink with
us on awesome hardware so you now have
to also see this balloon holiness yeah
now that's not getting bigger that's not
it's down here somewhere
Paul's like a balloon doctor you're like
you're like a balloon PhD balloon MD
you're like house but all your patients
are balloons amazed that that that the
person is still like whoa he's trying to
escape what oh my god you're still there
hey come on um some real Briggs
what's next Cal yes sorry yeah it's all
your fault it's really all your fault
alright wow so fast about Intel
confirming that coffee leak has
different a different pin configuration
than Katie Lake alright this was a topic
of hot debate this is from WCF tech
until confirmed in their coffee leak
briefing recently that the new CPU
family uses a completely different pin
layout then its predecessors kb lake and
sky lake and this is meaning that
there's not gonna be any backwards
compatibility with 200 or 100 series
motherboards if you bought a nice z 270
board recently and you were hoping to
upgrade your kb lake or skylake cpu to a
fancy new coffee lake chip sorry buddy
there's a different pin configuration
apparently that prevents you from
slotting in a brand new 8th generation
cpu into a perfectly reasonable LGA 1151
socket even though it also doesn't
prevent you from slotting it in well it
won't work you can put it in but it
won't work somehow that's what she says
and this has been confirmed by Intel
officially now meaning that this is sort
of a hardware lock not just a BIOS lock
out or a software lock out it even goes
into detail saying that there are 14
ground pins 14 additional ground pins
and 18 additional power pins that
coffee-like has that KB Lake does not so
Intel was apparently telling the truth
about you know the electrical changes to
the processors and sockets in the 300
series platform also it's not just being
reversed or reserved pins I can say from
Katie like that have simply been
populated but the pins there are pins on
top of that that were swapped with vc
secrets
and that indicates a design tweak
overall whether or not the design tweak
was necessary for functioning six core
Intel chips or just a way for Intel to
say hey you need to give us more money
inviting motherboard that is still
debatable and we'll never really know I
guess but this is very distracting very
I can't even I can't even continue on
I can't even formulate thoughts in my
head they're all being drowned out by
the sound of squeaking latex rubber and
Paul's filthy man hands what is that
microphone - oh that could be strongly
Photoshop all right let's move on to our
second to last segment here which is
case off case off is where we take two
different cases very different cases and
compare them and decide which ones we
don't have a lower thirds for it so
we'll just stick that in security visit
my house anyway yeah that's okay that's
all right we'll just go through the
lower thirds lists the cupcake yep one
of our best things choose the cupcake we
got to bring that one back
let's do choose the cupcake instead of
okay so I was gonna say if we had the
props so the first case that we're gonna
be comparing today is the cooler master
master case H 500 P ooh which is right
around the bend here it's not quite out
yet but it should be dropping relatively
soon probably within a week or so
according to Newegg yeah
real estate is 10/10 gen 2017 yes for
$149.99
it's the MSRP in the US launching
october 10th this paul mentioned is an
ATX mid tower and it comes with two
pre-installed 200 millimeter RGB fans I
really like how they're Big Ass Fans the
front I think that's gonna yeah they
lead to a quieter system I was always a
big fan of big fans me and you - yeah
but fun I feel like they can't went out
of style like 140 yeah took over yeah
but but I think you know I think the
reason why two hundred millimeter fans
didn't take off is because AIO started
taking off in areas are all 120 130 to
140 etc so but it's cool to see like
just a pure you know airflow based case
this is sort of again paying homage to
the half series of cases that
coolermaster was very well known for
back in the day 2009 to 2011 ish and
onward but you've got some nice
modernized features here tempered glass
alright on the side and what looks to be
the front maybe the front is plastic
it's plastic front is plastic but the
side is different tempered glass and
we've got a vertical GPU mount option so
that's kind of cool if you want to show
if your graphics cards we've also got up
to if you did want to throw in some
water cooling you do have up to three
hundred and sixty millimeter rate
radiator support at the top or the front
although I don't know why you remove
those beautiful 200 millimeter fans that
the case comes with I think it looks
nice I think it's a very polarizing look
because it's not simple they took some
risks here and I overall I think it
looks great it looks better in person
than it does in the pictures yeah and I
mean it can be hard to do sort of
accents or like you know whatever
plastic features like molded plastic in
shapes whatever on a case and have it
look good and I feel like that did a
good job here it's not too overly
aggressive um they didn't try to like
you know if it gets too overly
aggressive it looks like a cheap Chinese
knockoff brand that I don't know try to
appeal to many 13 year-olds or something
no offence 13 year olds or anything but
I think it looks great I think it has a
lot of potential to look even better if
you pair it with the right components
inside especially with that nice
tempered glass side panel to appreciate
everything in but let's talk about the
other case that it'll it will be
competing against today again we've got
a hundred Jesus
did you really just snap off part of the
balloon yeah you are balloon wizard I've
never seen that in my life really yeah
your your talents are wasted on YouTube
why aren't you like you know in a museum
or like on America's Got Talent or
something huh you're so talented this
whole time I just thought you were a
talentless countless prick
no no special abilities are our purpose
in the world okay I'm glad you're
blowing I'm glad that at last I have
something worthwhile it's offered first
I'm just like why is this man alive
what's he doing here all right the other
case that we have to compete against the
HR Cutter P is thermal takes brand new
view 71 no this case is already out
gamers Nexus did a really nice
comparison with this case against the
570 X which is why I'm not comparing it
against that case today this one's two
hundo this is two hundo so it's a little
bit more expensive than H 500 P but it
seems like you might get a few more
features that you lack on the
Coolermaster version you've got let's
say first of all it's a ATX full Tower
so you're gonna have more capacity for
drives SSDs mechanicals and that sort of
thing why you also get a lot of it's
much cable management area definitely
you get two for what is a four sided
five millimeter thick tempered glass
panels so it's kind of a very much again
like the five 70 X where there's
tempered glass up the yin-yang and you
each you actually get 180 degree
swiveling doors on either side that's
pretty cool
and it does include three 140 millimeter
ring RGB fans which are very nice fans
that's that's a huge bonus I think that
you know I think each of those fans is
like 20 bucks value so can you imagine
like it's a hundred and forty dollar
case with no fans and then three $20
fans included in the total price
vertical GPU bracket as well so that's
something that it has in common with the
X 500 feet and it has up to a 420
millimeter read this is a I believe a
larger case just mass wise leader wise
then
the Coolermaster half it does look
fairly large so because that's you do
get to fit a bit more hardware in there
such as larger radiators potentially it
also looks good I think the case looks
good
my one gripe aesthetically is the drive
cages I feel like no I don't like that
style of drive cage I just feel like it
looks doesn't look as clean to me it
looks it's kind of dated it looks kind
of like an older generation of case that
I used to be familiar with it was like
anything that has mechanical drive
support now just seeing no has nothing
to do with the fact that it's mechanical
it just think that just look at these on
the friend it looks you can remove
that's like you could remove those cages
there yeah it's modular drive cage so
that's nice decent it looks like they've
got the flexible mounting strips which
is good it's not gonna interfere too
much with your vrm hopefully or your
memory and temper glass just everywhere
everywhere looks good but we're talking
a $50 premium over the H 500 P which is
tough words in the same class but also
just just enough to differentiate it I
think this is gonna boil down for me
what kind of system I'm looking to build
it if I want an e ATX board with
multiple graphics cards and a lot of
drives maybe I want to have like sort of
an internal server or something like
that going on I might go I might go with
the other view 71 but from an aesthetic
standpoint I really do like the cooler
master 800 piece I guess he gets my
blood pumping excuse me gives me kind of
a chip wait what's what are you doing
now I'm fascinated like as soon as I
start looking at what you're doing I
can't look away now I gotta like see you
Michael you're doing blow my mind
oh how you use it right I find it
amazing how you can just sort of like
bend the balloon to your will and it
will just be like yes sir has some magic
involved and that's better it's
definitely magic sorry that's beautiful
yeah it's like a lightsaber oh is this a
UH this is uh it's a Kotori Hanzo
alright I'm sorry Lois yeah the purple
the purple hit sorry handsome beautiful
beautiful job tonight now you can pay me
with your purple sword here you're
terrible say horrible let's keep it red
all right let's move on to sponsor spot
no wait you didn't you didn't say what
case you wanted just just tell us which
one you like better between these two
yeah uh I gotta go each 500 P okay yep
we agree on that point
indeed okay why why just really quick
like one sentence the tempered glass
everywhere thing is not a trend that is
it I've found like a nice I think it's
got I think it's got this place for some
for some showcase builds here and there
but I think practical is practically
speaking it's it presents more
challenges than it's worth
yeah also like the the weight and
cumbersome mist of cases that have that
much tempered glass on them can be
challenging yeah that H founder just 500
P seems like you know it's big it's got
lots of room in there there's some
plastic cups it's got lots of airflow
but I'm there's some plastic mix with
the tempered glass I feel like it would
be a little bit more lightweight as far
as moving around a little bit and then
if you look at the print like I just I
like the way the front looks here I feel
like it's look nice with the two big-ass
RGB fans I feel like it's it's balanced
right and you know seeing those in
person with RGB effects you can change
those or make them a solid color or
whatever you want right and it looks
pretty cool in there so I think the fans
are definitely a huge value add yeah to
the case because they're they're RGB you
can whatever color theme you're thinking
about going with you can tune it to that
and there that's a lot of airflow just
passing through the case that just comes
to talk so which is good timing right
now because there's actual use cases
that can benefit from airflow like that
specifically like thread Ripper and
maybe potentially even more so if you're
overclocking
x-29 men yep like that cool all right
let's move on to our sponsor spot once
again we are being sponsored by deep
kukaku and their Capitan and 240 x RGB
last in the last half of the show we
were checking out their white version of
the cooler and now we'll check out the
black one it's it's very similar to the
white one it's actually exactly the same
but it's but are you putting that in my
mouth you son of a bitch you dirty
bastard alright so now we're in boxing
the black black version Captain RGB
which is different the fan the white
version are now black except the color
black and white take your pick
although personally deep cool or no
black boxes might get some heat for that
that's okay
black is really black the black is like
completely like the white one the white
one had some black accents on it some
subtle black the tube was black or some
this is completely blacked out
that is super stuffs very black
incredibly black their fans their fans
have a bit of rubber rubber going on at
the corners first and some dampening
which is and then the blades the fan
blades themselves have these cool
cool-looking slots gun gonna down them
there which allegedly does things maybe
that makes them way better or maybe it
just makes it look cooler I don't know
look cooler or act cooler find out but
even if it just looks cooler I mean
that's pretty cool yeah these the gamers
storm TF 120 fans that's what it comes
with I'm just tripping out that it
actually includes an LED strip I've
never seen an AO include like a
full-blown like 50/50 LED strip that you
could just mount anywhere that's like
look 10 bucks just ends up like 10 bucks
pending worry about it yeah I mean
that's a nice value add too because I
mean yeah so I'm saying if you if you if
you go on for this kind of thing there's
there's some aesthetic concern I mean
obviously it's an RGB all-in-one liquid
cooler RGB that's aesthetic you're
writing this coil you're gonna want to
use the LED strip because you clearly
like RGB things so plug it in that
connects right up there it's got the
it's got an adhesive backing and a nice
black back back
backing on the LEDs themselves as well
so that's good it's not one of those
cheapo ones because believe me oh yeah
there's some Jin Taiwan and China
there's cheapo ones that we did look
like there they never trusted and and
look pretty horrible so and that you
know there's plenty of motherboards
these days that have 5050 headers on
them so makes it even easier to yes it's
a word about the little standard four
pin yep poor opinion plug there so there
you go
no play the captain 240 X live lit in
black the standard version of black
shown here the white version as well as
shown on my half of the show there and I
believe it deep cools our sponsor for
the rest of October so you guys are
probably gonna be seeing more of this
yes I believe this cooler supports
pretty much all the modern sockets
except for TR for I think it does LGA
2066 and a important stuff I don't think
the Air Force support cool come I know I
looked in the box earlier like does the
only one who didn't see a pretty good
compatibility elsewhere alright that's
thank you cool for sponsoring that's
pretty much gonna do it for my half of
the show again like I said we're meeting
up with a vendor afterwards so we got to
keep it sort of efficient but we do have
some sponsorship or I'm sorry donations
donations no no what
I don't think so that's all you have
so let's read off some donations and
then oh yeah we got the nation's and
yeah let's start off with message
retracted that doesn't sound alright so
yes the first donation was twenty
dollars and it says message retracted so
that you can retract your message yes
someone donated twenty bucks and then
decided no whatever I said was - like I
poured out my heart too much that's
probably what but did they retract their
money that's a good question twenty
dollars at least according to the way
it's all copied and pasted this into the
show notes and the twenty dollars still
appears to be there so thank you said
retracted person whoever you are
for not retracting your money to El Jefe
interviews five dollars some guys Kyle
the battle video between you and wifey
sauce was the best couples video I've
seen this year Haim was pretty cool
thanks man
you must not get a report out very often
jujubee's ten dollars I have to admit I
found out about Paul after watching
Kyle's vids ayo I will collect all
appropriate royalties natural that's
only natural
yeah I've definitely had people say that
they found me through you and vice versa
and vice versa the Baskervilles vice
city Oh Brian D $5 donation what is the
worst thing you ever found while
cleaning the inside of a PC the worst
thing I notice for me I think I've told
this story before but um basically I had
a computer at the rear i/o like the IO
Sh
I didn't have an IO shield for the
motherboard so that was missing it was
winter and so it was cold and I'm a
story and we had a small we had a rat
problem I think it's a mouse probably a
little house house mouse or whatever and
discovered that the mouse had been
crawling up the back of my computer and
through the gap left by the missing i/o
shields and basically like camping in my
computer where there was still residual
heat for me playing World of Warcraft
the night before whatever so yeah it
wasn't that terrible but
found some droppings and some places
where I did it had made the number ones
and the number twos in there and clean
that out and learn learned a little
lesson about one of the extra benefits
of an iOS you don't always consider it
surrett pertain to my set of your
computer yeah I think for me it's just
just that sound a lot of dust a lot of
destiny no no cockroaches or no nothing
like you you clean some like neighbors
PCs or whatever just really really lots
of like incredibly doesn't like there
was no breathability like the heat sinks
were not heat sinks anymore they were
just dust cubes like hay stacks of dust
yeah
which can be equally horrifying its own
right Paul Paul the cheese says that
deadmau5 got his name by finding a dead
mouse in his computer
did he really that's according to a
trivia it pulled the cheese on Twitch
and he is a very honest person I don't
think he would lie about that no Paul
would you're right it's impossible it's
impossible
Matthew deal $10 you get 10 extra bucks
because I'm an idiot and I forgot to
type something the first time today is

Shirou dim churu dim jet tech $20
hey pong Kyle here's some money yeah hey
sure no technique here is us saying
thank you that's yeah cheers thank you
cheers Cheers you're stalling Heather
Hansen Heather Kyle why you wifey sauce
$5 $5 no more kisses for you get them
from Paul hashtag wifey sauce kisses
better than Paul no I want your seat I
don't know well I did say you guys both
kiss equally terribly no that's true but
that's not true I'll set the record
straight
my wife gives great kisses Paul your
kiss was wet and a little bit heavy
lipped if that's the term I was
but and you know whatever you want to
say how you know you were having some
weird puerto rican fantasy imagining
that I was Puerto Rican however you want
to spin it it's on you that's fine and I
could teach thrown but yeah my wife
gives amazing kisses also if I don't say
that she'll never make me dinner again
and I'll be completely out of luck
so my wife gives amazing kisses okay
we'll leave it that US home just cuz
I've got to defend myself here I was
going for coverage for distribution of
the lipstick that was my goal there oh I
could tell isn't trying I can tell
you're gonna sensual like you're going
for Emmy coverage and you know what I'm
sure I'm sure Heather probably would win
the the you know the gold trophy when it
comes to technique every time but
textured I mean just just when it comes
to actual like softness and and just the
actual feel like the lip feel I don't
think I don't think she's got much I
mean that's what I'm saying I think the
fact that it now I've seen your
balloon-animal skills it kind of makes
the kiss a little bit sweeter it kind of
sweetens the pot now that I just know
that there's a man of so many talents
behind that smooch gotta have a subtle
gets me a hot it's me I'll fire bothered
technique all right Tom's brim Smiths
with 70 7.89 region kronor listen
interesting a mattock okay you know what
would be better
six cores versus four cores with
hyper-threading given the price or 7700
K versus 8600 cake if I can tell you
that that would be I'm not allowing nd
you're not allowed to provide you with
that information right now break the NBA
Tom just wait Tom you're so close tom
you this time Alex Matthews $5.00 hey
guys I bought a 7700 K but I decided I
wanted to go rise in seven 1700 instead
but is it too late to return it to
Amazon you haven't give a 30-day return
right turn any
within 30 days they have a great opened
it or not that might be the the maker
break on that one daddy crime from what
I understand they're way more relaxed
with returns if you're on prime yeah but
uh didn't hear that for me with them
Kudo that dollars no comment once again
I bucks a man of few words and many
dollars very much sir jujubee's five
bucks because I keep missing your live
streams beer for Heather Oh beer for
Heather I will get her dress Bertha make
her kiss me more motorsports more
motorsport NJ New Jersey perhaps five
dollars want my next bill to use a
horizontal motherboard layout are there
any challenges you guys know with that
sort of layout horizontal like with the
i/o on top and the motherboard
statements yeah motherboard flat
parallel with the ground the main
challenges are gonna be
aesthetics as far as I'm assuming you're
having io pointing up that's what I've
seen mostly that and that so the benefit
you get is that the GPUs hang directly
down from the bracket so it's good for
GPUs no sag or anything I think he means
like inside of like a 250 D or like a if
you mean the mother very flat horizontal
like that I think though there's no
problem with ya know as long as a decent
case you mean horizontal like this with
the GPUs hanging vertically GPUs get the
benefit of hanging rather than being
sideways so you don't get drew pitch but
isn't that still vertical though what
its event it if you're looking at
motherboard vertical motherboard
horizontal like that or motherboard
vertical motherboard horizontal like
that nice thing that's what she I guess
yeah that's it that way but I yeah what
I see more is that through 90 degrees
keep using it from the top but mainly
what I've seen there's is your i/o and
stuff comes at the top so that can be a
challenge for cable management depending
on the case but than that is a good way
to go yeah you should be fine it really
boils down to the case more so than like
it's like the case layout and design
more so than the motherboard
orientations specifically but a good
question
tormak trolling tintin for the 515
canadian here's some american sense
informs of Canadian dollars because
Heather told me honey
the best did you wipe it up keep telling
our reviewers to give us money
Jake 3d $5.00 cots I'd be live finally
at least I finally got a video up today
first time in a while congratulations
still try to come up with a name for my
PC that is a that is a tricky one you
you don't you don't want to you don't
want to shortcut that you want to make
sure that you give it a good solid name
that's gonna stick has long legs is
appropriate and fitting to the character
and personality of your system well I've
given this way too much thought but a
good luck on whatever name you decide to
name Omar Omar Tyndall for the five
bucks the chilli paste
I sent is some balls Bob get some wild
magic must be the minimum but some some
bold bad some bold badass some pretty
good I can't wait to try I hope it's
really spicy I have a fairly high spice
tolerance so sometimes it can be a bit
underwhelming Fred grant once again five
dollars too late Kyle you're still
sleeping on the sofa yeah what else is
new Fred tell me something I don't know
and I already know at least we have a
comfortable sofa that's the best thing

invest in a comfortable sofa because
you'll be sleeping on it often no not
really
did you seem like the right I've never I
decide myself either I guess tonight
will be my first night but we do have a
comfortable sofa
Sebastian kassay for the 80 Argentinian
something here take my Argentine sueños
he even said ladies - thank you very
heat like he knew that I didn't know
that I knew I was doesn't dreams sueños
his dreams yes I love your Argentines
dreams I don't think that's the name of
that currency
oh he's basically saying here's my money
as well as my dreams of like that's
actually I feel sad now would you take
his buddy yeah it seems like a lot of
Dreams the demo
toilet for is I mean is that
perhaps master
I'm 1999 finally that the $5 donation yo
guys you never answer my question last
week on radiator stacking fan rad fan
rad fan trying to fit a 1080i hybrid and
h100 ib2 in an air 240 fan weight
radiators stacking well we have to ask
to the question again cuz clearly we
don't remember Argentina's peso any news
our dreams I was right I was
I know Spanish you do I see I thought
that was the legit currency because the
abbreviation is AR s urge and genius
when you but it's pesos why isn't a RPG
office not ours
art that's why I always thought ARS
technica was just a website about
Argentinian currency alright III don't
know what to say
I think radiator stacking is an
interesting concept I've never seen it
tested never tested it myself
but I don't think it's practical oh yeah
this having that tested it or not
knowing anything that more about it
myself but I feel like multiples like
that doesn't make as much sense to me I
like a single rad with fans on one side
or a single rad and push-pull
I feel like fans red fans rad fans just
adds more steps in between where you
lose efficiency or something like that
so thank you guys very much for the
donations we've got some jumps and shout
outs that you can go out write about new
oh yeah today we got one from Earl and

ah I don't do well enough popping things
I've realized especially on stream all
right sorry teddy
so this point we just we're done with
the show but we're gonna continue
broadcasting Paul making interesting
things with balloons today's today's
switch raid is just gonna be a
continuation that lost some hardware
we're rating ourselves no we actually
are rating something else
and we'll wait to reveal after we see
what Paul is made what is this this is a
teddy bear it is what and then these are
the these are the arms yes and then the
legs it's like holding its knees or it's
just like come out chill on that couch
didn't aunt even got like a little a
little low tail yeah did you practice
before you came no I haven't done this
in u5 you look like at least at least
five years you didn't have one of the
most supernatural memories I've ever
know it's Muslim and essential memory so
it's not still memory it's muscle memory
and the reason I'm screwing up some of
these is because still in the begging a
big part of it is how much air you put
in each balloon cuz as you twist it
pushes more air down towards the
so like ideally you want to use that all
up so now with my old pump I had a much
larger pump and I knew exactly how many
pumps it took for each type of thing
it's like a motorcycle five pumps right
and then I have the exact right amount
of air and I could do it all from that
so I'm having to guess a little bit more
with this little thing right to pump it
up or whatever but beyond that it's
muscle memory like a lot of it like at
I've had to think about a little bit
like cuz it's also but like where you
start like with the bear you start with
the nose right right make the base
around it and stuff this is all very
fascinating and but yeah and new to me
and and yeah it's muscleman like I used
to be able to just take any animal you'd
ask for and like make it behind my back
just cuz I knew by feel yeah it's muscle
memory you don't need to actually see
that so that's pretty badass guys we've
all learned something new about Paul
today I'm impressed
thoroughly and thank you guys so much
for joining us for this show I don't
yeah they really follow that up with
anything anything better ever then I'm
gonna switch rate at which raid twitch
