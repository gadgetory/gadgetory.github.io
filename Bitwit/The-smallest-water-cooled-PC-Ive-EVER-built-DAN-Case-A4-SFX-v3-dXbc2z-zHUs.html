you build websites for virtually
anything sure you can create a website
for weddings baby showers and
graduations but if you're like me you
find all those things incredibly boring
I'd be more interested in creating a
tech blog to document my adventures in
PC building or a place to host my videos
where I decide when they get demonetised
which would be never the possibilities
are endless and Wix gives the user full
creative control on how the site looks
and behaves so if you're a DIY fanatic
you'll probably enjoy the site building
process as much as the finished product
customize your web pages with photos
video or vector art add social media
bars to boost your online presence or
utilize one of the many apps to extend
the functionality of the site
even if you're a total noob at building
a website these features are laid out
within an intuitive UI so all the tools
and resources are right at your finger
clicks wordplay I know you've got some
big ideas we all do turn them into
something real today with your own
website from Wix and get started by
clicking the link below what's going on
guys welcome back to the channel today I
am assembling august's PC of the month
which I'm really excited about because
it's a system that I'll be using
personally for editing and gaming while
I'm away at events obviously it's gonna
need to be very small we have a small
form factor case a very special case of
deed now of course I do bring my laptop
everywhere I go as well
which is super convenient but every now
and then I just feel like hooking up a
basic old desktop to a monitor and a
keyboard and a mouse just to have the
full functionality of a desktop PC so
that's what we're gonna be assembling
today you could almost call this a
spiritual successor to the go anywhere
do anything PC that I assembled a while
back in the note 202 from fractal design
we're gonna be using the dann case a for
sfx case today which is the brand
spankin new model v3 okay this just came
out it just arrived and so that's
another reason why I'm really excited
I've never done a build inside of any of
the dann cases the first this is the
first one I've ever had got my hands on
so again I'm just really excited you
guys know that I love small form-factor
builds the biggest new feature that
comes with this case is support for a 92
millimeter
yo you guys might be thinking dude those
even exist I thought the same thing but
apparently they do because I managed to
get one this is the ASA tech 5 for 5 lc9
look at how cute you can fit the whole
radiator in your hand right and you got
a standard ASA tech waterblock as you
might expect tubing is like nice and
short because they're expecting you to
put this inside of a tiny case and so
yeah this is apparently supposed to
mount natively now inside of the dann
case a for v3 along with a 92 millimeter
fan that we'll be needing for this it
didn't come with a fan so I actually
pulled the Noctua NF a 914 off of the
CPU cooler that it's included with of
course you can buy this fan by itself
ala carte or whatever but since I had
the cooler around I'm just I'm doing a
long-term borrow I guess so it's gonna
mount boom like that or like that or
like that or like that I've decided yet
but these two things going in this case
it should be pretty glorious now let's
get into the core specs shall we with
that 92 millimeter a IO I will be
cooling the rise in 7 2700 x8 core 16
thread CPU this seems like a good
contender for this build I was thinking
about going skylake X with that as Rock
Mini ITX board and just going balls to
the wall but I don't want to have to
worry about heat and the skylake X chips
are not known to stay the coolest the
Rison 7s stay relatively cool for the
amount of horse power that they're
packing so I think this is gonna be a
safer smarter bet for this particular
system overall it's gonna be less
headache less worry and all that so
excited to be using that along with the
ROG Strix x4 70 I gaming motherboard I
recently did a video on the B 450
version of this board almost identical
except for the chipset itself which
gives you a bit more connectivity which
I won't really be needing honestly the B
450 version would have worked perfectly
for my needs but since I have the x4 70
board lying around might as well use it
will be pairing that with a kid of
g.skill tried nzr GB ddr4 at 3200 speed
and this is actually a 32 gigabyte kit
because I wanted to max out the memory
as much as I could on our Mini ITX board
here since I will be doing 4k video
editing and 16 gigs just doesn't really
cut it for me at the for the amount of
editing that I do when I'm on the go so
hopefully this will get the job done it
also looks pretty so so it's a win-win
next to that we have our samsung 970 Pro
it's a 500 gig nvme and to SSD you can
see I didn't have any retail packaging
this is actually a sample that AMD sent
me along with their thread Ripper 2 kit
earlier this week this is one of two
drives though that I'll be putting
inside of the system I'm still waiting
on a 2 terabyte WD blue which is a SATA
based m2 Drive and since this
motherboard supports 2 m2 drives because
it has 2 m2 slots
we're gonna be able to connect just
about two and a half terabytes of SSD
storage without ever having to bust out
a SATA cable so that's really exciting
powering the system is the corsair SF
450 which has an 80 plus gold
certification it's fully modular and of
course it's sfx so that it'll fit just
fine inside of our Dan case here
excellent unit and that should be enough
power to drive all the things you see
here
and finally our graphics card is the
zotac GTX 10 atti mini this thing's an
absolute animal for its size and to be
honest I could have fit a longer
graphics card inside of the Dan case
because it's just so well designed to
house full-sized hardware but I wanted
to go the mini route anyway to leave a
bit more breathing room because when you
max out the space in a case this small
it really does harm your airflow in my
experience and it's also just more
difficult to do your cable routing more
tightly if that's if that's a word it's
probably not but all things considered I
think this is gonna be a phenomenal
build can't wait to get it started so
wide why don't we do that right now
all right the builds done and it
definitely took me a lot longer than I
anticipated this is certainly one of the
more challenging small form-factor
builds that i've assembled in recent
memory but I think that's because we're
dealing with such a tiny case there's
hardly enough clearance to get all the
various components installed and they're
just kind of just barely touching and
rubbing rubbing up against each other
but that's sort of the point right is to
is to cram as much hardware into as
little of a footprint as possible but it
looks great looks really nice there were
definitely some challenges that I
encountered along the way so let's talk
about those for starters the radiator
fan that I snagged from that knock to a
cooler the screws that it came with were
not long enough to actually thread into
the radiator the threaded part of those
screws is shorter than the width of the
fan and that's because the heat sink
that comes with this cooler has raised
threads or raised mounting points that
kind of go into the fan holes just
enough for those screws to thread but
they certainly don't work on a standard
radiator so what I ended up having to do
is take a pair of scissors and chisel
away at the four mounting holes of the
fan just so that the screws would sit a
little bit lower and thus protrude from
the other side allowing us to thread
into the radiator so that's how we
solved that problem it could have been a
lot worse
but luckily we found a pretty easy
solution another obstacle
once again stems from the AO in some way
the power supply was interfering with
the radiator fan with that knock to a
fan the cables were just sticking out a
little too far and even though they're
flat cables they were still just rubbing
up against the fan and the blades
weren't able to spin at all at all so
what I ended up having to do was kind of
rout half the cables this way towards
the motherboard and the other half the
cables towards the other side of the
case on the graphics card side that sort
of split the the width split the load
and I was able to get everything in
there without interfering with the fan
the problem at that point was having
excess cabling on the GPU side and so if
I turn this around actually I'll give
you guys
look at it right now so here you can see
our 24 pin ATX cables that I've sort of
routed upwards and flat against the
power supply as much as possible and I
actually zip-tied them to the PCIe
cables up top to encourage that that way
it's just further away from the radiator
fan and also really flat as to not
interfere with the graphics card
backplate so there you go that's the
system I cannot wait for part 2
personally because we're dealing with an
AO of a very particular size that I've
never worked with before I have no idea
how it's going to behave with the 2700 X
I'm not exactly sure what to expect with
our GPU temps it's gonna be quite
interesting we have a lot of questions
that or should be answered in part two
so stick around for that guys that's
gonna do it for me toss like on the
video if you enjoyed it also get
subscribed for more tech videos on the
way and check that out on floatplane if
you want to watch my videos a week early
without ads for 3 bucks a month I'll put
a link for that in the video description
as always thank you guys for watching
have a good one and I'll see you all in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
