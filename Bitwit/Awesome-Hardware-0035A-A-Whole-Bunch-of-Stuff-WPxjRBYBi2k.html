whoo that is and I'm going to tag you in
my tweet and tell people that we're
going live any second now that's awful
decent of you we're live right now can
oh boy are we hello everyone i do not
know that welcome to the show this is
episode 35 if you're watching this on
twitch welcome in chat thank you for
joining us live if you're watching us on
youtube and you'd like to join us live
for next week we do this little shindig
every tuesday evenings at five-thirty
pacific time wherever you are in the
world figure it out and yeah we really
want you to be really catered by how it
just sounded to the international
audience here that's right after I do
that's right but first up I just want to
preface this this stream this show right
now by saying that there was just a huge
unveiling just happened on Twitter by
our friend fractal Josh to set the tone
right away here yes I'm just gonna go
right into it with a nice ice breaker
here many of you guys might have caught
his periscope that he did go ahead and
follow him he's amazing man majestic as
 as I should say to be exact he just
unveiled this amazing painting that was
done it was kind of fan-made he actually
commissioned Kimberly Schultz who is a
gamer chick really cool girl had the
punting Pole and I you you played a few
games with Kim before right maybe like
rocket League and stuff um I played with
Kim yeah okay and she's cool you can
pick my word for it and she also paints
very well so Josh actually had her paint
this majestic portrait of himself
carrying define our five on a unicorn
nonetheless he's carrying the windowed
version the windowed version of course
he had to pay extra for that one he's
also wearing the Pie Face shirt and the
Pie Face shirt from Linus unicorn
shooting a rainbow out of its out of its
it horn oh I didn't even notice the
rainbow doesn't some details that you
didn't maybe you didn't pick up on the
livestream unveiling the periscope the
Josh did a little bit ago but yet some
details you can definitely check out if
you follow josh right rectal Josh and
for all those for all those of you guys
at home who like to photoshop images
this is like it already comes pre
photoshopped you don't have to photoshop
Josh on a unicorn anymore it now exists
natively i would say what more could be
added but i'm sure oh yeah it's seen
there's oh yes of course is virtually
limitless possibilities exactly so very
nice Kimberly if you want to go follow
her on Twitter it's Kimberly Schultz
that's a five instead of an S and then
Schultz's hul TZ and then Frankel Josh
if you want to follow josh you should
already be following Josh but but that
was a good way to start the show but
that just had because that just
literally happened like ten minutes
before we started screaming um and let's
move on to merchandise I guess sure
usually we're like two photographer let
us try it on the hell Paula know you're
still selling shirts nothing has changed
from the last week or the week before
that hoodies are still on sale ten
dollars off all of the hoodies whether
it's all demos or my store we do have
separate stores but if you make a
combined order you get to save some
money you get a little kickback on
shipping like a rebate or something like
that Kyle's has sold out of this hoodie
yes so why am i showing it to you guys
but you can still get this hoodie from
Kyle for thirty bucks that is true some
sizes whereas over on my store you can
still pick up this fit ear aight here
which has the pauls hardware logo on it
i've also got mugs and glasses and that
kind of thing in the glass or section if
you guys like a i want to say i was
about to say handcrafted but i have no
idea of this handcrafted or not he's
lovely lovely 20 and i think it is
because I've never lost before in my
life not a beer yeah also really quick
stay positive shirts are almost sold out
in every size they've been selling like
hotcakes but if you guys were in the
market for one I will be reopening them
soon so don't worry cool yeah they've
been selling well enough for me to
restock them at first I was worried
that's that's this one right here it's
going alright yeah and he is interested
all right sexy all right now be your
check well be are you drinking home this
is samuel adams octoberfest because it's
actually pretty good for an oktoberfest
beer and it's like as a very reasonably
priced and so well time nice little
combination yet well be weird if no one
questions you but if you were drinking
that like in june you'll be like i like
why are you drinking at the oktoberfest
be I don't even know what very time what
to call it other than oktoberfest beer
but that's all you realize
description you need right yep i'm
actually not drinking beer this time
today on the show i'm gonna be drinking
some some bourbon whiskey some Kentucky
straight this is basil Hayden it's
really good stuff I had the privilege of
trying it not too long ago but I picked
a bottle up on the way here and I'm all
is going to join me in drinking it very
recently apparently it's open did you
already take some no no I drop reopened
it I can open its open up the crinkle

very thoughtful of you and even though
Paul is drinking beer he's also going to
have some of this with me yes I'm gonna
have a little bit of both I'm not I've
been sort of developing a little bit
more of a taste for for the burbs but uh
I'll give you a sampler just a little
sampler yeah alright well yes cheers
Cheers to thanks tell you all for
joining you to you this is sustained you
sippin whiskey yeah I'll bad right
that's good priest miss goes down smooth
it's not like the get drunk and beat
your wife type of whiskey no or bourbon
no it's not good thing too cuz we're
both married yeah we would actually have
a wife to beat now can't wait for Diana
good to get home she's bringing us a
Filipino food she is yes wow sounds they
received an end date from that okay cool
anyway let's move on to our first
segment now that the show is officially
started after all that shenanigan so
it's it's the fund or not to fund pull
has be lower thirds ready to go maybe we
go back there I was turning on Arctic
Panther because i felt like it should be
on uh to ponder not fun what's really
good Laura thurs or thirds but that is a
first segment all right lower thirds Wow
to fund her not to fund and now my new
segment lower thirds are already
forgetting Paul can I get that to funded
onto fun at the bottom of the screen
it's right there I know I meant to say
that but never so China around a year
right I it was totally failed because it
could have worked both ways anyway I
glance to chat immediately distracted
this segno is it to do is where we take
a look at some Kickstarter's or
IndieGoGo campaign is crowdfunding
campaigns and decide whether or not
they are worth our valuable dollars
usually they're more popular than not I
like to pick ones that have been doing
really well just to see what is trending
at the moment so this first one is the
way lens it's a data-driven automotive
camera system you basically mount this
little HD camera in your car and it
sinks to the internal components of your
car so it tracks things like speed or
velocity or even the g-force of your car
during your driving experience so it
tracks your J force experienced it
tracks your not not that kind of g-force
so this is this is not this is not
either team green or team generates its
ambiguous or agnostic know what's the
word egg nest egg naturally agnostic
asst no no it's a a little aluminum
aluminum that's aluminum that's right um
so basically what this does is after it
gets gathers the data from your car from
your ride it essentially compiles like
it compiles like a like a highlights
reel of your drive okay that you don't
really have to edit yourself because it
basically just tracks all of the most
interesting data that happened during
your trip now and instead of having to
manually hit record you know like a
GoPro like a dash cam or whatever you
have to hit record or some of them just
go 24 7 this one will only start
recording once the data show something
interesting is happening happening
that's say so if you go from like zero
to 60 in like three seconds it'll like
start recording or whatever it'll be
like hey that looks probably exciting
yes oh so I'm gonna record it that's
pretty smart so it's it's a smart
feature for I guess driving enthusiasts
who who already have a dashcam maybe
you're planning on getting one I
personally have no interest in this I
Drive a crappy hyundai elantra that's
from 2006 and it's got you know hundred
thousand miles on so I'm like not like
you know driving around corners j from
this is about to say this is for j raid
read your mind right there so when he's
you know driving around in his what's
his e called again 350z i know he's got
a name for it though it's a little orgy
a little Jaden no that's his daughter I
said littler little Lord no they
strutted badge a faster J yes I don't
know whatever his name is um someone hit
when he solves his problem when he's
racing around town he doesn't have to
like hold his cell phone up you know
it's like captured
footage right at the most intense part
of the drive right which is what he
typically does I don't know that that's
if that's true or not I just said it Zoe
it's Zoe at say mr. says everyone in
chat wow how do we not know that I don't
keep track of the names don't always
absorb like I know you have the car
Instagram I know the name of his
computer yeah but you know yeah anyway
all right so but it's kind of mood i
want to point out here cows kind of move
the whole fund or not to fund this is
already funded by quite a decent site
here true 341 thousand dollars if you
want to get out on this for twenty nine
dollars no $29 day hey do you give us
money to feed e essa to fit e but those
are all gone to fitty all gone you got
to pay 300 right now to get a package to
get this little guy let's meet
deliveries of July you really got to be
in a droid next year for it to be worth
it yeah all right what's next the next
one is the aura 3d I don't know if I'm
pronouncing that right hey yo I don't
care I'd see 3d skin iota high-precision
3d scanner for your smartphone okay it's
really like a 3d scanner like separate
from your phone but it just uses a
mobile app to kind of start the scan
into you know do you think rebel Kaduri
here is related to raja Kaduri no never
my tech I don't think cells from AMD all
right so this is some clear copyright
infringement on lucasarts no but no it's
not all right so how does this work I
was watching this out of the side of my
eye earlier yeah and it's why does it
spin the camera because I say it's been
that's spinning its spinning the object
object but it looks like it can also
move the camera in a circle why why is
it do that uh so i think it's it's you
can either I think the spinning platform
is optional ok but so if you if you have
a fixed platform I can't spin 360 then
then the actual scanner can go back pan
back and forth to get them work ok so
it's moot it would move back and forth
and see like this this was
didn't make sense to me initially yeah I
don't think it actually goes 360 it does
probably does like a 180 or like you
know like a 60-degree pan or whatever
but anyway it takes over a thousand
photos with one single sweeping motion
when it's trying to scan an object and
objects can be big or small the laser
kind of fans out so it doesn't have to
be like you know it's a six-inch
figurine or whatever okay oh pretty
larger they didn't specify or I didn't
see if they specified how large but it's
supposed to be really precise there's a
bunch of aspects that you can check out
if you're in if you're really into 3d
printing you'll probably know what those
specs me more than I do like like sub
100 microns and stuff like that that's
how small it that's like that's like how
fun that's like yeah the resolution
basically right so 250 no no that's two
hundred dollars to unlock to it well it
was 200 if you did the early bird thing
but now you got to spend 2 30 there's a
230 if you didn't jump in right he
didn't jump in early enough so you could
either get the Whelan's data-driven auto
camera or you can get a 3d scanner for
your phone because they're about the
same price but you can't get both but
you can't get both because you only have
two hundred and something dollars
because I checked your wallet
can't argue with that I don't know all
right so that's an interesting device I
will say 3d printers you got to have a
3d scan time you don't have to but it's
pretty damn helpful to be able scan
stuff in I've been some of the 3d
printers I thought really coolest were
the ones that had 3d printing and scant
scanning at the same time absolutely
kind of go ahead just to hand in hand
the last one is the BioPod it's the
world's first more than hold on hold on
k what no I don't want to join the
millions who love Windows 10 oh say I
just had to close that I don't know just
bothering it's it's getting so much more
and more intrusive now now it's like oh
yeah I'll do windows updates wait a
windows update is Windows 10 no that's
not an update whole new operating system
you bastards you're blurring the lines
get like I'm gonna do it in my time can
I do it in my time all right I think
next week like when if you don't close
the pop-up you know it will just start
expanding these are taking over cuz like
you like go to click on something it's a
good nasty bug but upgrade okay all
right last one is the BioPod haha so
first off again it's like a this is like
an outhouse hugely successful no it's
not we're on portable out has its been
funded two hundred thousand dollars out
of its 22,000 goals so ridiculous
amounts of money have been poured into
this thing and what is it it's a micro
habitat for growing weed magic mushrooms
peyote and all other kinds of delicious
drugs any types of like schedule one to
schedule three drugs that you might want
to grow and grow in here every class
step-by-step instructions no that's
actually not what it's for adult balls
not I you know maybe it's wishful
thinking on our end or to some degree I
don't know I always wanted to try peyote
but you know what this really is for is
for growing herbs or herbs as they say
in the video they say it incorrectly
they say herbs herbs Paul and I had this
discussion before the show and you can
also grow like or basically create a
habitat for like certain like pets or
little animals reptiles frogs clever
example I should probably tell you what
the main feature of it is though is that
it's app controlled and there's also a
bunch of like you know
technology built into the the tank
itself that allows you to kind of
automatically control things like the
lighting the temperature the humidity so
usually when you actually like what say
you wanted by a lizard or like it like a
you know an exotic oh I love you had to
buy about lizards all time you have to
buy like individual components like a
humidifier and all sorts of things to
he's got a lizard on his phone yes you
guys but this already comes built in you
control the climate and everything with
you app that was a HD camera that's
built into the tank so you can monitor
or you can see the live feed of what's
going on in your tank at any it from
anywhere in the world you can see in
China and be like what's my gecko up to
this is HD camera do these like nice
like slow pans and like soft focus like
like put focus full okay I said pocus
Foles bukas bubbles look the hell's
wrong way to insanity why are we
drinking bourbon ah ok but nickel rich
quick this is the point point is you got
you can put fish lizards herbs herbs or
we or me or other yeah I mean how many
people are just going to buy this for
like a hydroponics it seems like a small
and portable solution for a problem that
no officer that's my video pod we don't
really encounter this problem in
California fortunately yeah but alright
so for the to get it on the ground floor
on this on this deal here it would have
been no 200 200 bucks was the early bird
special now it's 280 280 is the cheapest
amount because all the other other ones
were sold out so I right to 80 but
you'll more than make that back with
your first harvest of grade a cron hazel
it was a little basil basil alright cool
so that's that's pretty much it for 200
note to find out of those three Paul
which one would you say you'd be most
likely to fund uh well i'm not i'm not a
big driver person so can't say i would
go for the automatic create data-driven
Whelan's yeah i gotta say the 3d scanner
is pretty it's pretty interesting i mean
i would pro I'm not the kind of I'm not
kind of jump in on this right that after
you too what up 3d printer yeah you're
right it would go better with since I
don't have a 3d printer i guess i gotta
go at the BioPod yeah I'm kind of in the
exact same Bozzio right and I've always
been boys want a frog oh well what's new
products available on our stores very
soon yes postcards were fruitless with
frog or we grow our own all right
homegrown anyway the new segment we do
is I just want to also say that this
this segment is kind of still in the
works it hasn't been fully polished yet
it's called videos that are good and
that includes the title it's also a
working title that is all subject to
change this whole segment is just
haphazardly going together what he doing
over there I'm shifting stuff in the
background cuz the flicker of that
monitor is bothering me reach back there
like five times I don't know it's a
working progress on fire some work in
progress all right so anyway this
segment I talked about a few videos that
i found on the internets that are good
nice since the name of the segment I
know like I slay better than videos that
don't suck see that's the suck thing we
were talking bout this too is very
played out a lot of segments like this
doesn't say that doesn't suck it focuses
on the negative yeah okay fun that so
the first video that I want to talk
about is the force awakens trailer the
new Star Wars that's coming out directed
by JJ Abrams no one's interested in this
Kyle it only has 19 million views in the
past it's not even you out here for
hours no no this was last night right
actually maybe maybe just about 24 hours
yeah good lord yeah that's the hey
people are I'm excited me too and when
you watch the video you'll be excited
too if you haven't already i'm sure
you're one of the 19 million I'm sure
all of you in chat are one of the 19
million who's already see ya most likely
no one's not seen this yet but I just
wanted to give it some attention because
you know after after the somewhat
disappointing arguably disappointing
release of the the Battlefront beta from
EA I kind of needed a good pick me up
when it came to like Star Wars
appreciation and Matt and fandom so this
was like the perfect thing to like spin
me right back into it this trailer looks
phenomenal again that's why I'm saying
trailer is because you can make any
movie look
from the trailer it's it's almost like
scary how good a movie can be it when
condensed to like a minute long then you
watch usually what the hell this is
horrible but JJ Abrams I have faith that
he'll do a decent job he's known for
doing things like lost very popular TV
show as well as a like cloverfield and
some other kind of cult classic films
that have gotten pretty good gotten
pretty big but I don't know what did you
think this trailer Paul did you was it
everything you hoped and dreamed cuz
you're you're a star Wars fan uh yeah I
mean I'm a star wars fan I'm not like a
star wars like hyper fan or you know I
don't know what you call yourself when
you're crazy fan of Star Wars I mean I'm
actually I'm not a chris pirillo or
anything like that uh I mean I'm really
really happy that JJ Abrams is doing
these movies I think of all the people
out there who were in a position to do
them he's probably would be in on the
top three of the list of people he'd say
that guy he could handle it and because
it takes it's it's such it's so huge now
that it takes such a subtle hand to do
it right and you can even see even
George Lucas who did the originals
didn't direct all of them but you know
who created this whole franchise he
screwed things up big time when he when
he did episodes 1 2 and 3 I mean all of
them have their pluses and minuses but I
mean yeah like you get you got it you
got a really good understanding of film
you got to have you got to have some
repetition of some of the stuff that
made the originals great you got you
have to go back to that same formula but
you have to have stuff that's that's
different you know this time around
doesn't seem like an imitation yes sir
and you and and I am also pretty
confident that JJ Abrams is not going to
be one that's gonna pander to kids which
was I think what killed so much of the
first ones was like George Lucas had
this idea is like oh the new generation
of kids needs to love these movies and
blah blah anyway we could probably spend
this entire show talking about Star Wars
and all that kind of stuff good analysis
but but yeah I'm excited yeah and
there's a lot of really cool stuff in
the trailer look I might I just might
camp out and be one of the first ones to
watch it when it comes in theaters and
Christmas I'd have some fond memories of
going i will say going and seeing the
the re-release are not to read released
but episodes 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 I mean just getting
excited going camping on everything yeah
and and I really hope these live up to
expectations one of the things that my
mom got me for my birthday like a week
or two ago was a Chewbacca sweater and
it like has like Chewbacca fer this
little reverse a rumor Chewbacca's gonna
die Shh why would the rumor I don't even
let members JJ Abrams also known for
having no qualms about killing our
members or spoilers waiting to happen
it's true sorry I saw a time bomb I
blame boogie I said boogie tweet about
her there was already but some people in
chat have you mentioned like oh I was
trying to avoid any kind of trailers for
though really sorry guys apologies
hopefully she'll droids shield your eyes
again because there's another trailer
that we're about to show like this time
with fallout 4 accept it to live action
trailer doesn't reveal too much it is
kind of more done in a cinematic
cinematic style soft with this very
happy neighborhood suburbs in the
suburbs and all of a sudden that gets
blown to like within two seconds so
you kind of know shits going down and
then this guy comes out of his a little
underground you know bham bham basement
where i was called and then he you're
all right but you just you like took a
sip really slowly and you're just like
looking into the glass and slowly
putting it down like three I'm trying to
count little okay I'm trying to you know
taste the bouquet or something like that
no um but but here it is uh I think it
looks it's it's pretty sweet I would
have liked to see an actual gameplay
trailer or something I think that's
gonna rolling towards but people and
chatter pointing out it's his fallout
shelter it's a swallow shelter duh thank
you thank you guys I'm apologize johnson
Johnson how much just to jettison all
right yep my merit of czar great Thank
You Dow I know it's over agree with you
yeah it's really sure it's only a minute
long okay um but this might be the very
first fall out that I actually
because I have not played any of the
other ones okay i'm new to the franchise
do not crucify me i'm still learning but
yeah that looks pretty sweet anyway
let's move on to the last video for the
segment which is back to the future in
GTA 5 this is a susan game crate yes it
is alright GTA 5 back to the future now
GTA 5 release or introduces a DeLorean
you have a game recently with a patch
right the new patch also came out today
I'm going to talk about that in my half
the show this is someone's recreation
yes it was this I was interesting was
this created by fans which is created by
the rock star man fans it was a created
I think it was just maybe one guy but
this is the very famous scene where the
DeLorean is first introduced to Marty in
the first back the original back to the
future and you can kind of see the doc
they've actually done a doc is just kind
of like a rien vision Trevor that's what
your thoughts are pretty great so yeah
they use the audio from the movie you
know to go over these really just
brilliantly recreated shots yeah of the
DeLorean and uses you said you suspect
this to all be done in rock star editor
I I don't know I I really don't but I
mean that's what I would expect yeah me
sweet yeah Marty's got the camera and
everything Doc's got the remote control
do you want to know something really
like a fun fact about back to the future
paul i know many fun facts about back to
the future but hey I'd like to learn a
new one too well let's see if you if
you're up to par on this one so when
Back to the Future to the second one yes
doc and Marty they actually travel
through time to october 21st 2015 yes
which is tomorrow oh that's true yes so
good luck trying to find them tomorrow
guys hopefully you can maybe spot them
but it's unlikely as the time-travelling
duo duo will probably be written off as
a hipster and a schizophrenic homeless
guy but but there you go that's
something to look forward to alright
alright I have a counter to your back to
the future fact okay so that scene right
there was actually originally shots very
close to here at the
a tamal this is the puente hills mall oh
yeah that's that's where that was shot
but Wow in that scene right there not
once in that scene right there if you
watch the movie at the beginning and
when Marty comes up to that mall it's
called the Twin Pines mall this there's
so many little details in the back to
the future movies that I just love and
adds these random little details at it
so in the beginning of the movie it's a
Twin Pines mall and then he goes back in
time right at the first when he first
shows up back in time is like oh this
was the farmer whatever the farmer's
land had this crazy idea about raising
pine trees then as Marty as leaving is
driving the DeLorean off of the property
he drives over one of the pine trees at
the very end of the movie when they come
back when he comes back to nineteen
eighty-five right it's the Lone Pine
mall and like they made they made two
signs like they like that costs money
and like thought and everything and its
energies and it's just that bits just
these little details are in that movie
that I'm just like anyway that's so I so
come on out yep every little bit so that
I thought was pretty cool kudos to the
person who made that I'm gonna look
really quick see who that was because I
feel like I should have shut up you
should give them so who are you a man or
woman show yourself a number of savvy
users thanks savvy users then so this
was done in the editor yeah I read all
the articles the night well we can't
give credit because Robert workman who
will give credit to the author of this
article from game creep Robert workman
yet he didn't credit whoever the person
was who did the video right some of you
revoke our or credit this is GTA series
videos is a channel it's on which has
1.1 million subscribers and show more in
the description description so you see
if anyone's like I did it I so use the
mods back to the futures time back to
the future time circuits mod so you do
the mod DeLorean time machine pack and
some other stuff there okay well thanks
everyone they would you
was involved all right moving on to our
next segment would just sponsor spot
this bad we've got another sponsor whose
gigabytes shocker today and they gonna
tell you another sponsor who is still
the same another sponsor who's our
sponsor last week okay oh yes what are
they what do we have today we have yet
another ever popular products unboxing
to do for you guys it's small I like you
this is it this is a little tiny
motherboard okay let's switch and also
guys to save anyone who's getting like
like stuff like that getting sick from
before da right we have fixed the camera
is now fixed usually you guys can see
what the hell were actually doing this
is so much better this is H 170 and
Wi-Fi so this is a motherboard designed
for the new Intel skylake series of
processors which is socket LGA 1151 this
is an H 170 chipset board which means
that it's not for overclocking so don't
buy this and put it with the 6700 k or
6600 k what this is more made for is
maybe the non k processors in those
ranges or maybe the slightly lower end
ones so the 6400 k is the one that i'm
actually going to be doing a build with
with this motherboard because so I do i
do have a bill coming up with this this
one right here um accessories are in
there you get your Wi-Fi modules and
your antenna and you get some data
cables your i/o shield board itself is
all black it's very nice looking and
nice thing about this motherboard is the
freaking price like oh my goodness it's
like 105 or hundred and ten dollars no
hold it up really close Kyle let me see
if I can focus on it wait later point
towards the light I do love how it's
completely blacked out like usually with
blackout boards like this it'll be a lot
more like maybe like the PCB is not
completely black or or like I mean I
guess the caps are the capacitors are a
bit gold there but you can't really even
see them because they're kind of
shoved into the corner but also like
sometimes the dimm slots will be like
not black or whatever i guess this pcie
x 16 could like but let's see what else
what else is on here I don't know so
it's a pretty like basic board yeah i
mean i usually get this is a budget
board but i thought on newegg it was a
reasonable price but hold on home so you
get you do get front panel USB 3 which
is good you get to say deportes by 16
pcie to dimm slots there's also this
comes with a thermal armor right no
doesn't no no no it does that alright
well I found this on Amazon at least 12
I feel like I'm pc part picker you could
get this as for as little as 110 bucks
but it's 120 right now at least an
Amazon okay ignored that review rating
cuz it's just one person just one guy
who probably didn't know what he was
doing it couldn't build a computer he
works at issues it works earlier today
sees no no's Wi-Fi too yeah it's got
built in Wi-Fi got your expansion slot
there if you want to build a little bit
more budget oriented small system I
think it's a great choice h 170 and
Wi-Fi as part of the ud ultra-durable
series from gigabytes and for being such
a budget board it does have two to hdmi
on the rear as well as USB 3.1 type c
nice which is yeah the type c node and
the thing that I really like ooh-ooh
high-end feature here like that and one
of the reasons I when I saw this part is
like that's pretty sweet that right
there and you guys probably can't see it
real well as m dot to sew em to looks
like a 20 to 60 or 2282 lengths that you
can support their on the back so that
means oh nice pour their cuff you that
means you can easily just drop in an SSD
right there and depending on your cut
out on your computer case you might even
be able to access that right um you know
without removing the motherboard but the
thing I like about having on the back
here is if even if you have like an
hideous green one or something like that
yeah you can still pop it in there get
your nice fast SSD storage bill
sin and drop down there and you know
have to worry about what it looks like
either so and did you mention it if it's
a tower pca you're both i believe it's
both I know it's pca I know it can at
least do pcie i'm not sure if it does
say too nice but yeah cool anyway that's
age 179 Wi-Fi guys we're gonna look at
it again on my half of the show but
thank you goodbye for sponsoring yes and
so endeth the sponsor spot yes okay
let's move on to pit my pc a blatant
ripoff segment from matt phillies pimp
my setup on swashing TV go ahead and
check out on youtube i think a lot of
people are still getting confused
between his his segment or his show in
our segment because some people will
just send me pictures of their desk I
really like with their computers on it
and I have no idea what what there's
something it to me for until it says
like hashtag could my pc and like oh
that's what's the wrong true but so if
you got if you guys are going to submit
to any pit my pc entries or basically
you know photo of your system please
send it to me tweet it to me at forever
kyle on twitter of course and I want
that side panel off porfavor would be
most most appreciated I panel it off as
good well in likes ya some decent
lighting in there so we can see what's
going on a few different shots with a
few different angles yeah definitely
Oliver hurts always appreciate it yeah
and if you're if you are going to only
take one shot make sure it's
all-encompassing of your entire system
because some people will only get like
the cpu and GPU area but leave out the
hard drive cages and I don't pick those
because I just feel like it's G I feel
like you're hiding something I don't
trust you so make sure that it's a you
get everything in there so the first one
is from Victor Victor yeah I closed it
why cuz hike was trying to close the
tabs we were through with a neat old all
right thank you for sending in your
computer Vic you have even if your
name's Victor then you automatically get
a Russian accent from cows oh you gotta
cook the imgur sorry I share link to do
there but he's got a 76 TT I believe you
have that case bald I do also in white
very clean it looks like you've kept it
clean or it's a recent build you've
gotta see x750 a man there i'd take that
sticker off i would just the green i
would too unless you're planning on
adding some more green but i don't think
you really need to cable extensions
would work
tactically here a really nice
motherboard i like how how I like that
PCB look how clean that PCB looks oh yes
yes it does that so what I'm MSI's
gaming series motherboards yeah you've
got just a bit of red trim on the
heatsinks there so maybe you want to go
with like a predominantly what black and
white system with accents like with red
accents so what I might suggest is
getting like I don't know I wouldn't
custom sleeve your own cables just get
some black ones or some white ones some
white ones might look pretty pretty nice
but how else could you throw a little
bit of red in there I mean um to throw
red and idea I don't know yeah i'd have
to say via cable extensions or yeah i
mean extensions yeah there's no other
red accents besides the motherboard yeah
i will say cable management or overall
looks pretty good maybe maybe think
about doing some this little cable
towards the front couple cables peeking
through here and then another thing that
you don't often consider you have a
sticker on your SSD and different SSDs
have these stickers on different sides
and ideal I've dealt with this before
crucial notorious room yeah the sticker
doesn't look all that great so I'm heat
getting that off at depends what drive
it is and everything but flipping it
isn't always an option right maybe
getting rid of that could be a somebody
I also noticed that his ram is he's got
four sticks in there but they're two
different kids oh that's true so I mean
I'm not going to tell you they're all
hyperx do not use that if it's working
properly but generally a rule of thumb
is if you're gonna if you're going to
buy ram just buy the maximum amount that
you feel comfortable with right away
because that's the only sure way that
you're going to be guaranteed for that
kit to be compatible for all those
sticks to be compatible with each other
and these so these actually do look like
he might have bought these at the same
time and he might have intentionally
because they're all hyper x these are
all the same model right they're just
different colors yeah so maybe this was
he was intentionally going for a black
and white stripe ething there yeah but I
mean but your eye will point this out
this is something not everyone's
familiar with even if you're buying if
you're let's say you have a four by four
kit and two two by two kits
right now yet you have you have a 44
stick get a tattoo stick kit yeah or two
of the two stick kits even if it's the
same capacity same speed same everything
the four stick it will still often
perform a little bit better or work just
have better compatibility right out of
the box because the jtech values that
are assigned to each of those sticks are
optimized for a four stick configuration
with a four stick it whereas the two
stick kits or their set up for 22 way so
you'd probably work and if you not a do
memory stuff you can go in there and
adjust the timings yourself and
everything but that's one reason why you
might not want to do something like this
right um although honestly you if you
pay if you've had zero stability
problems and everything then it's it's
really like not a huge deal you at least
a few months before your computer
explodes yes should have a little bit of
time left all right Don thanks Victor I
appreciate next is Aiden hey then all
right one secure 4770k gtx 780 z97 pearl
motherboard a one terabyte hard drive
and overkill 500 gig SSD and what's
going on at the bottom here he didn't he
says overkill power supply but he didn't
say which one over Jamie's hardboard
that's that's shielding it I'm guessing
he's very ashamed of it it seems to be
not something he's proud of but you
should be proud of the cardboard either
the cardboard is like I I am of two
minds with the cardboard one is that
anymore you've taken some time and
you've done a little bit of work in some
effort to enhance the visual appearance
of your computer however the cardboard
it's at least in this picture is very
obviously cardboard yeah and while I
applaud your efforts it just didn't turn
out all that great yeah good news it's
just cardboard you can just so you can
probably just pull it out of there's
actually I we added to the sides of my
case I i I'd also be curious I mean it's
also a little bit of a fire hazard and
if you have a short in the wrong place
or something like that that's some to
consider as well right um I'd be curious
what power supplies actually underneath
there and what made you really love me
like it was so hideous that it
did that over it the cable you have
other extensions of your power supply
has cables or sleeved cables probably an
extension yeah uh so yeah anyway did you
have something specific part of this
apart from the card where I mean it's
really all I can keep staring at but
apart from that the fan cable that's
just going over your cpu cooler just
maybe tuck that away a little bit
couldn't hurt and it looks like you like
he's even cut holes up it on the top of
the cardboard like enclosure till I rub
cables through and stuff oh well that's
some customization right there that mean
I don't know just just route the cables
coming into power supply like just zip
tie them and make them look tidy it'll
look way better than then the cardboard
I promise you unless there's like a dead
cat under there or something that you're
trying to hide like some weird you know
your toenail clippings of the people if
you somehow manage to put a dead cat in
your computer I'm impressed very
impressed yeah I mean you have to be
like a jam anyway Thank You Aidan thanks
Aaden appreciate that buddy next up
we've got Marcel head I I always think
of marcellus wallace thermo Marcellus
Wallace something from pulp fiction yeah
all right so my old case wait he has a
story here yes one day when I was
upgrading my mom's ram my dad decided it
was a good idea to take the heat sig out
the processor and look at it when he
pulled the heatsink up the processor
came with it he then decided to shove it
back on without lifting the retention
arm a lot of the pins were bent computer
has never turned on again the components
are actually based on one of your budget
build guides oh sweet all right uh god
help you oh look at that look at that
SSD mouth that is epic Wow a
revolutionary SSD mounting solution I
call just tape that sucker anywhere hell
yeah uh cable management hole right
there some some cable management nice
depth of field uh Titan killer this is
the passively cools passively cooled
Titan right there that is a Titan I have
to assume the worst fan oh this one was
like super thick like industrial fans it
probably runs really high rpms and
thanks a lot of noise uh that's Wow big
old wine rack nice rack and I'm guessing
he must just run this system open in
that little tray right thing or he just
had it up open for her he just opened it
up for for the pictures Oh fernet
Netflix browsing and stuff and he's got
a wireless keyboard and trackpad and NGC
already's got to stay positive shirt hey
right there thanks Marcel double Johnson
doesn't look anything like Marcellus
Wallace no he doesn't I will say that
all right so it should just please yeah
so what's the what's the verdict here is
I mean it's a budget build right so it
doesn't make sense to really tell him to
get cable extensions or or you know swap
out the cpu cooler for example but that
being said I still think that there is
some room for cable management
improvement for example like the 24-pin
ATX I mean you've got the power supply
way up at the top of the case but then
you've got that that motherboard port
way at the bottom and you've kind of got
to route it all the way around your kind
of just filling up the rest of the front
area of that chassis with with extra
cable length what I would say is try to
round up the excess of all these cables
up next to your power supply so pretty
much between your power supply and your
your optical drive I would try to route
all the excess stuff and bunch it up and
kind of pull it away from your
motherboard know you're the components
and if possible maybe maybe you could
mount a fan to the front of the case
because right now I'm only seeing one
exhaust you know being that that 80
millimeter it looks like on the back
plus your power supply but that's that's
a different story so if you could maybe
like zip tie I mean I did a build
recently that where I zip tied a fan to
the front and it's working out fine so
maybe you could do that even if there's
not any fan mounts there and n sleeve
your cables I have to custom I have to
completely disagree with Kyle on this
one I think this computer is perfect as
is you should do nothing you're lying
no no I mean and then in to some degree
I'm being honest like you shouldn't have
we shouldn't work on this fine it's it's
leave it I don't touch it cable
management is fun no that's but that's
why we're trying to instill in de pere
I'd all right you don't have to save up
the SSD is you I love the SSD meet you
that's the beautiful thing about SSDs is
really you can just take him down and
just type in SS day on top of a power
supply at one point and somebody's like
was gonna get hot on top of the parcel
like no it's not I mean I guess it'll
get a little bit hotter but it's fine
it's an SSD it's it's really fine so as
long as you keep your cuz Paul will kill
you if you find your computer on the
floor yeah but if we're whatever reason
you at your computer on the desk and
then just like really long say the cable
going down to the floor with just your
SSD like lying like collecting des palm
be like oh that's fine but yeah but like
even even like even the fan in this
evening adding a fan here is just I mean
it's it obviously runs yeah it's like
it's fine I'm just you really are trying
two clutch clutch at straws there's
something for you to do all right we got
one atom one more two more we didn't
want more here so here's Adam Adam I use
a little bit more contrast yeah a little
bit more contrast there and a little bit
wider shot but would have been helpful
here I'm is visible look he's got one of
those zotac cards where they they took
the reference design and then they added
his otac sticker and they put it on
upside down yeah that's kind of funny uh
okay so what I doubles yeah I mean get
some cable extensions like usual did he
spray paint a fan on the fan the fan
accents or where's the butcher Phoenix
no no it's really just ya know that's
just the court those are those are the
Corsair aesthetic pressure fans I think
oh yeah I know that with
white but this project I think it's just
the lighting okay yeah um it's what
motherboard is that it has like orange
track lighting on the bottom left it
looks why it's epu so that's a is that
an asus motherboard yeah fan xpert it's
an asus board weird i don't notes
Burnett sefan expert right below the RAM
oh yes it is a cna cistus to TPU an EP
there's a way to turn the LED off that'd
be good yeah maybe kill that led and get
some cable extensions and then send us a
wider shot next time yes yes thank you
okay I go except next us lately not
there storm 99 yeah yeah I seven 4770k
gtx 770 16 gigs of ram 750 watt power
supply no your laser oh that's a rose
will laser power yeah I mean that's not
super old no but I'm does the rates
within the past five years I think sold
it's kind of old yeah uh what so what do
you say about this cable name of the cat
Spencer cat good job you can I like the
inclusion of the cat has uh what do I
say about this cable management yes
there doesn't seem to be a lot of it
going on like really there doesn't cable
chaos like this is cuba's noisy I can't
I can't view this image Keeble ah yeah
this is this is just one of your
examples of how you can put a computer
together pay zero attention to cable
management put aside a case on and
probably be fine honestly I socially I
probably probably be just fine yeah i
mean like this case doesn't look like
you have any cable routing there's
nothing behind the motherboard tray here
you could pull out this drive cage you
come with the drive to the bottom and
pull that cage out you could cinch up
all these cables and try to out them
this way and then up on this side of the
motherboard tray I don't know if you're
four pin or eight pin this long enough
to do that but yeah there's clearly zero
cable management going on here so yeah
do some kill management right I guess
that rules will power supply I've used
I've
haven't used it but I know the laser
series when it came out internally is a
good power supply it's not like gonna
blow up on you or anything it's not like
some of the earlier rosewell power
supplies at some major problems right uh
I think it looks hideous the LEDs these
blue LEDs that go on each plug as you
plug in the modular plugs it's like
really really doesn't match with
anything so there's not a whole lot
you're going to be able to do here
without a new case and a new power
supply as far as making everything look
pretty but it looks like your core
components are reasonably good enough I
mean 4770k of gtx770 maybe consider
dropping an 80 bucks or hundred bucks on
a case sometime soon do a little swap
taps of fun dual rebuild clean out your
desk get it and get an hour supply with
like black sleeve cables ready to go now
you have to pay extra if you if you
really need the power supply which it
looks like you do then save yourself the
extra costs and just get one that
already comes with ya the black cables
okay alright that's all for pip my pc
yes it is and last but not least we've
got news time out tech news the first
one I want to talk about is the gigabyte
fury card that just launched it quietly
launched they didn't really have too
many big announcement sport but it is
available now does come overclocked of
course you could push it further there
were only a couple other vendors who
were making fury cards you know on top
of AMD's reference design but here's
another one it's using the windforce 3x
cooler which is a very popular cooler it
does feature a bit more bulkiness so i
think it's a larger aluminum finna right
so even though it's a 2 a 2 slot card
it's actually the size of a 3 slot card
because of that extra bulk oh so bear
that in mind it does have a really nice
back plate on it comes right out of the
box at a thousand and ten megahertz that
is bulky as a bit about gay it's got 28
pin connectors pca connectors and okay
and that's all and the same video
outputs a configuration that uh oh the
other thing I want to mention you'll
notice that the the PCB is not super
short it's actually I a custom PCB by
gigabytes full length that's full length
and so they have not reused the short
reference one so i like i like i like it
when a vendor does more than just slap
on a new cooler i like it when they
tweak the PCB a bit more i feel like i'm
getting more from my money sometimes i
agree that who is that saw a picture of
an asian girl anyway let's move on okay
sorry what's next it's a the nvidia
drivers thing we're all familiar
business in video game ready drivers to
require GeForce experience yes so
starting in december GeForce experience
which is the program that was initially
ruled out by nvidia to optimize the
settings your in-game settings for your
games obviously so that it runs well
with your hardware that is now being
it's going to be being pushed as a
requirement for downloading your g-force
drivers what I know this is crazy um
there's actually a quote here GFE will
be the preferred first access
distribution mechanism for invidious
frequent driver updates that's a quote
from an antec and they don't mess around
over there in that take their serious
 they do he's got another know their
stuff they are so so what is it like
right now right now you need a driver
update you go to nvidia right they roll
out usually maybe every every month or
every other month or when a really big
game comes out you can download a new
wickel driver or beta driver you just go
to the use that you go to google and go
to the nvidia the woman the likkle ones
is a quarterly way the quarterly ones
are the wicked ones right but they have
all these other drivers in between for
like when big games big titles come out
and stuff like that you can just go to
the website and download straight for
nvidia but now we're going to change all
that they're saying look you have to
have GeForce experience installed and
you have to register with an email
address you have to give in via your
email address now if you want to get all
those in between driver updates
otherwise if you if you don't want happy
if you don't want to give up your email
address you want nothing to do with
GeForce experience because it's stupid
then you only get access to those
quarterly wickel drug
the Paul was mentioning you'll have to
just wait wait it out but that's I don't
know yeah I think it's BS yeah I smell a
little bit of BS in any of this because
I didn't think the system needed any
changing to begin with I'd never had a
problem downloading nvidia drivers and
it just seems like a way for nvidia to
steal get get my get access to my email
address and be able to reach me have a
greater advertising or a marketing reach
with their with their users by by just
getting getting email addresses I agree
I don't like this I'm not for it I don't
use GeForce experience regularly and in
fact I often intentionally don't install
it specifically if I'm running
benchmarks and stuff like that because I
don't want it messing with any of my
game settings so this is going to be an
inconvenience for me ya sure it's just
an inconvenience I could give my email I
could download it whatever blah blah but
I don't think this is like it's not a
pro consumer move there's nothing about
this it helps people if you want a
geforce experience before you could get
it and download it just fine this move
by nvidia is forcing it on people i
don't like anything being forced on me
and I especially don't like it when it
seems like they're doing it because
they're like sitting pretty in the
marketplace like yeah because they have
a big market share and all that kind of
stuff went to cash my night yeah so I
don't like it I don't like it that it's
it seems like just a grab for the email
addresses and to get people to use
GeForce experience and to have another
little thing sitting down in your system
tray and all that kind of crap yeah so
yeah I disagree nvidia and i think you
should change your mind if for all those
material or not right now yeah probably
not anyway okay um moving on to the next
story which is oh yeah so I threw this
in here just to briefly mention that it
exists Tim Cook's from Apple huh he's
talking about the Apple car the electric
vehicle that they have planned for 2019
saying that it's going to change a lot
of things about the automotive industry
Apple's been known in the past is just
say things like this is revolutionary
it's going to change everything and it
really doesn't but I'm still kind of
curious to see what they do
I mean obviously here's the thing is
there's some speculation that what he
means by that is it's going to be
partially autonomous and that would
allow you know a more because because I
guess the article also talks about how a
lot of the tech that's built into these
cars these days isn't really appealing
to many people like people could care
less about the technology that's in your
car because you're focused on driving
hmm you can't really utilize that that
technology very much anyway but if you
have an autonomous vehicle that gives
you more opportunity and more room to
play around with all the little trinkets
and and features of your car think of
all the ads that could be fed to my
dad's not having to pay attention to the
road that's right it's lay down load
it's like if driving past billboards was
annoyed you at all right now imagine
when you're just sitting there and they
can just like pre-rolls on every thats
yeah maybe maybe you can get your car
discounted if you get an ad-supported
car I want an ad for eco dude would you
would you pay for an ad free car or
would you be like I am happy to get free
transportation I'm getting getting an
ad-supported car I'd install auto and
block where I can get I can punch in my
destination and the car will drive me
there and I get in the car for free but
the whole time I have to watch ads I'd
installed the ad blocker for cars cuz
there's probably companies thinking
about that right now yeah how much money
do you think will make off of car ads in
like 2019 yeah but there seems like most
of the ads anyway are already for cars
so this seems like a natural progression
true okay ah you have more stuff amazon
assuming people yeah like screw everyone
they sued 1114 reviewers yep for selling
their opinions well I'm dollars that's
kind of what I do what don't we sell our
opinions I mean we don't do not sell
them that's true we give our opinions
and we stop slots on those opinions
that's true very very very key
difference between that yeah um okay so
so here's the deal amazon has sued these
people for writing fake reviews sorry
that's nice hearing okay you write some
hip that's why so basically people
are going onto websites like fiber I
don't know if you've heard it but it
basically offers a like these little
side jobs that people can take four five
dollars or more hence the name fiber
very clever haha and essentially a lot
of people are advertising themselves to
be really good at posting fake reviews
so that these companies like maybe small
like I don't know for example like a
small cell phone case manufacturer from
Taiwan who just really wants to you know
be the next big thing and they just
paying money to these people on fiber
sites like fiber to go out and write
fake reviews for their product so that
it you know obviously sells more um but
Amazon which is a very like it's kind of
created and gets its credibility from
its user reviews right you go to Amazon
because you trust the user reviews a lot
of people review stuff on the site and
that can really impact your purchasing
decision I know it does for me so if
these if a lot of these reviews are
illegitimate it kind of also dis credits
amazon as a company and as a brand so a
bunch of lawyers lawyers from amazon or
coming out and suing everyone they're
suing everyone fiber is not to blame
though i should say as you point that
out because in their terms of service it
prohibits anyone using their website to
to break the terms of service of the
third party okay so so yeah they're
clear they're not they're pretty much
not involved it's really just the the
people on fiber who are writing these
false reviews who are the real
defendants here in this case one such fo
reviewer I thought this was kind of
hilarious guarantees that she can place
reviews from 100 different amazon
accounts along with other promising
perks including lifetime stable amazon
reviews 100 100 different unique IPS one
hundred percent safe one hundred percent
five four three two or one star ratings
now that that piqued my interest because
that means some people are probably
paying pain to leave one star reviews on
unlike competitor product goes both ways
that's that's almost like a whole nother
level of messed up it's horrible imagine
bringing a product to market like at
amazon or something like that then
suddenly get a bunch of negative reviews
because your competitor paid somebody
five bucks right
that is like you have no soul as a
person like both both parties involved
and also the last per kyle of here on
the if you scroll down what I'm not
showing them in this right now oh you're
not show the mat okay scroll down to the
bullet points right there the very last
11 high percent money-back guarantee
that looks like an intentional
misspelling to me does it I don't know
is it really guarantee like you said
this was guaranteed no i didn't i said
it was a guarantee because they gear
they spelt guaranteed right above it
perfectly oh that's true and then they
completely butchered the last one so so
maybe it's just so the other stuffs
guaranteed your money back thing that's
just grantees right and who knows that
means i'm really curious which means no
I've never had a money guy interview
don't get any money back right yeah
alright so good job amazon keep them
keep them in check keep keeping those
fake or viewers on their toes yep okay
steam controller sucks moving on
questions of singularity they remove it
uh oh ashes is the thing you learn um
yeah okay we can talk about steam
controller later sure ashes of the
singularity DirectX 12 hits steam early
