there we go
cool good enough all right hi we're
doing it we're doing the thing where I
live
we're loved it both yeah yeah welcome
everyone to awesome hardware episode 169
good
16 thank you very much for being here
this is side B if you happen to miss
side a and check it out on Paul's
channel you can find the link to that in
the video description if you're watching
us on YouTube we're go to youtube.com
slash Paul's Hardware this is a
livestream a tech news show variety show
the pollen dine pollen I do every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right
here on twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
and thank you for being here we
appreciate it but this is a fun show we
like to keep things pretty lacks eat a
couple nuts in the meantime and have a
few drinks while reddit so if you're if
you're if you drink along with us she is
she has to all of you oh yeah we need to
we need a beer up beer up can you get me
one
oh you what surprised me the Halloween
beer they both have guys on them of the
road did gay
yeah actual official did guy and I
should warn you that we occasionally use
foul language so if that is an issue to
you then you may want to leave the room
or I don't know had little ones around
if they if they're if they are around
but apart from that we like to keep it
pretty fun and lively and hopefully you
guys learned something on one of the
show or something something along the
way while we do the show
scratch scratch that yes never mind
learning as we as we both pour like
Arthur's worth beer hopefully you
learned something from us we're the best
role models you should learn from shows
basically boon to all of humanity if
anything you'll lose brain cells by the
end of all of this but more of a
likelihood but on the bright side if you
stick around till the very end we will
be reading off all the messages that
you've
to any donations that were sent in the
first half on falls half as well as any
ones that you send in super chet on my
half they're always very much
appreciated never never required though
and then also we'll be doing johnson
shed us for our stores so if you happen
to pick up anything from my store bit
with tech slash store where i've got a
bunch of stuff
hoodies pint glasses bottle openers that
we just used glasses themselves a bunch
of stuff you will get a johnson shout
out also go to pulse paul store go to
paul store paul's hardware net where he
also has hoodies pint glasses a lot of
the same stuff but his own designs as
well and and we have a new we have a new
design actually now some hardware robo
love design from j ted the JTED yeah
JTED JTED was was just a fan or a
subscriber who actually made this design
and we liked it just all the burps all
the verbs are coming at once scheme
coming all JTED designed this and we
really liked it so we decided to slap it
on to some of our merchandise and it's
really cool it's an exploded view of a
pc and there's just so much little cool
detail in there and it looks really nice
looks really good on a shirt or hoodie
so definitely check it out make sure to
LIKE blow it up on your screen so you
can see like that what i wear this or
not and it doesn't matter who you buy
the awesome hardware merchandise from
including this design from doesn't
matter whose stories we split those
those dollars equally so thank you very
much in advance and to have new freshly
printed zero insertion force stuff and
this is gonna be last run of the zero
insertion force stuff so as if merch you
get it get a now or vienna or forever
hold your peace
okay all right let's move on oh let's
say let's talking about news there's
some tech news that we've got going on
here so tom's hardware article about
power color releasing kind of kind of
jump of the gun here releasing the red
devil RX 590 information and product
page two days before the official launch
date i've 90 i'm not sure exactly how
this happened maybe this is like you
know taiwanese branch or something like
that or you know Eastern branch and they
whatever it was it was November 14th or
15th where they were and they just
didn't realize
we're actually releasing this early from
the western market time changes are
tricky so the page actually lists a
November 15th launch day and I should
mention that the power color page that
was initially reported on is now taken
down yeah so we can't see that we can
just kind of see the regurgitating stuff
here from other sites but was it was
listing in November 15th launch date so
if you guys were interested in rx 590
you should be able to purchase one in
two days from now so so that's the thing
the card itself if you want to take a
closer look at the red devil is
obviously on the twelve nanometer
process here we've got twenty three
hundred and four stream processors a
boost clock of fifteen hundred and
seventy-six megahertz which is quite a
bit higher than what you'd find out on
rx 580 and this is to be expected with
the the die shrink and that sort of
thing we also have a 256-bit memory
interface eight plus six pin power
connectors and a six plus one
multi-phase design with a 605 you'll
probably knew the 650 watt power supply
to drive this guy that's what it said
which was a little bit high in my
opinion I thought it was it was higher
than I expected it to be I think it rx
580 is like 600 maybe even less so I'm
not exactly sure I mean you know
obviously with with higher clock speeds
you might generate more heat but you
should also be more power efficient you
would think with with the die shrink
that way so it could also be technical
error or a typo or whatever on the
website so that's a green easel or
factory overclock did the rumors the
frequencies are significantly higher
especially if you confirm to like what
the 480 was originally shipping at oh
yeah 480 my one at the 40 come out two
years ago to two years yeah yeah so so
yeah but but power color has not been
the only ad board partner to sort of
leak some of these these photos here we
also have as rocks rx 590 phantom x OC
which has been pictured courtesy of
overclocked 3d net and it says that the
the PCB and the cooler seem to be pretty
identical to the rx right there there
are X file ad phantom gaming X models so
nothing terribly new here and you
it's it's still more or less the same
same kind of architecture that we deal
with so I wouldn't say you know I
wouldn't expect any crazy new designs
adding board partners aren't going to go
out of their way and create a bunch of
new tooling for for the RX 590 as
evident is here take a single 8-pin
single 8-pin connector which also tells
you that it's probably a little bit more
low powered than the red devil that we
just saw which had an 8 plus 6 pin power
connector configuration this is also
slated for on November 15 release and
you know it looks it looks cool looks
you know it's color neutral it's got a
dual fan heatsink design currently open
shroud a couple red accents there so I'm
still just getting used to as ROC
graphics cards yeah it's definitely
interesting I have an idea to actually
hold one in my hands or test one oh it's
it's an amazing experience I'm sure it's
spiritual those life-changing never be
the same afterwards touches you in ways
that XFX has also leaked some some
photos of their RX v 9d fat boy that boy
this officially wins the award for
coolest name for an Edinburgh partner
card video cards dot-com has has given
us an information about this card looks
identical to XFX is existing rx 580 GTS
series doesn't seem to be any apparent
differences this also has an 8 + 6 pin
connection leading us to believe that
this might clock around the same as we
saw with the Red Devil 1600 megahertz
boost clock frequency that's actually
higher I should say than the Red Devil
so that's cool and you get a full
backplate full coverage backplate okay
I'm not sure if that doesn't dissipation
for you there but look at fat copper
heat pipe yeah everything about this
card is just so fat very fat it's a
thick it's a thick boy alright so cool
all right 590 you know what you're
basically looking at is maybe of 5 to 10
percent performance uplift better power
efficiency higher clocks
you're probably gonna see performance
that's better than a GTX 1060 but not
quite as good as it as a GTX 1070 so
somewhere in between there but hopefully
for the price or maybe not much more
than the GTX 1060 so it kind of it kind
of fills the gap between the 1062 1070
to some degree for a reasonable price I
think right now though you know as as
price with this price I think two ad I
saw two ad but I could that with
thousands from the article okay spec
spec speculative speculative pricing
speculative pricing was saying 280 to
300 that's where that's at least where
would have to fall in order to stay
competitive with the type of performance
that's expected of it that sounds very
legitimate if it was outside of that
range then I don't know what AMD is
really doing and no I'm not breaking any
NDA III don't I don't have no idea what
the pricing of this card is gonna be
legitimately so I'm just I'm just kind
of spitballing here and I thought it's
probably not even this is probably all
elaborate ruse probably no it's probably
no such thing as an RX 590 you know this
is basically a unicorn that we've we've
crafted with our imaginations um let's
see who fools came either really later
really earlier this year let's move on
though that said video cards calm once
again came up with an article about the
GTX 1060 particularly the I game GTX
1060 you top v2 I don't think this is a
card available in the US because I've
never seen this but perhaps overseas and
a lot of people were speculating that
this card was just sort of magical in a
way because it featured gddr5 X memory
so people were like wait how does a GTX
1060 feature to do terrified X memory
well the the truth is that it kind of
doesn't that's not that's not actually
the case here instead of rather a GTX
1060 this is really using a gene
P 104 cut down GP 104 GPU which is found
on the GTX 1060 that's you know I'm
sorry ten eighty seven eighty ten eighty
sorry that has as few as half of its
cores completely disabled huh
so it's almost like they had like a week
batch Nvidia had a really weak batch of
GTX ten 80s or GP 104 s I should say and
they're like you know we shouldn't
probably use this for our ten 80s and so
they're like hey we could just allocate
this for you know a gtx 1060 and brand
it with the gtx or actually have gddr5 X
memory attached to it so that's kind of
cool it's it's also kind of weird
because the card still has SLI fingers
on it because it's the same PCB as a GTX
1080 I wouldn't think that you could
still SLI they've probably disabled that
somehow they probably lasered that off
or something like that
but it's also kind of weird cuz there's
dual eight pins have you ever seen dual
a depends on a GTX 10:16 no so so so how
much are they trying to sell this for
like that like it didn't unless I missed
it unless I just like not really in the
know pricing was over I didn't see any
pricing yeah
it couldn't be that much more than a
standard GTX tens people who are
thinking that they can somehow hack into
it and enable the disabled cores no you
can't you can't resurrect lasered off
course it's just not possible it's a
hardware thing they just they they laser
that shit off so there's no BIOS update
or anything from where update that you
could use to get more performance out of
this guy yeah it's interesting to see
what what price this will actually go
for and it probably won't even be in USD
because I've never heard of I think I
have her I have heard of AI game I've
just never seen it sold here in the
States but there you go in case you guys
were freaking out wondering how Nvidia
pulled this off did that that's how
that's how it's done
chitty-chitty chitty-chitty GP 104
wafers become 10 60s with gddr5 acts and
then moving on here we have one more
graphics card story for today a lot of
GPU news this is from overclocked 3d and
it's talking about the new Aero ITX this
is the first ITX r-tx card from nvidia
ITX RT RT x 2070 Aero
i TX i t XR TX there's a lot of t axis
so many TX is nowadays Krabs it of the
same product name and look at how cute
it is single card heat sink design
fairly open shroud and hey this will be
really great and in like you know a Dan
case like a Dan case a for this would do
superbly and something like that or just
a really tiny mini ITX build that you're
trying to if I'm if I may offer
complaints and I was thinking about this
when I was handling my gigabyte RT X 20
80 TI earlier today which is a $1200
graphics card the the 20 70s it's still
very expensive what are they seven seven
twenty seven so he 705 500 600 yeah it's
still 500 in system yeah this is a
design that I've seen MSI use maybe not
this exact as I am at a very similar
version of it I'm like much cheaper
cards this is probably a plastic shroud
yeah whatever but it's like the base
level designs for the 2070 in the 20 80
and the 20 80 TI they do the things that
you would expect for the entry-level
designs with cards like if you're gonna
get a really cheap GTX 1063 gig you know
there's just
yeah they need to make a card that they
can produce for less money right
seeing that you could see that here
perfect card that you're starting prices
over 500 bucks for yeah it's just like a
yeah it's because they're in such high
demand and because there's no
competition in this space yeah
those are the main two reasons and it's
it's almost like you you can kind of
fault it at Atia for but at the same
time it's it's more of just like the big
picture like this is just the landscape
of the situation and you know it's it's
good business there if you if you read a
business textbook this is what it says
to do if you're in invidious position
where you don't have any competitors in
a certain space you can you you can you
have a bit more flexibility with how
much you charge for product maximise
profit maximize profits you know uh
maximize margins all of that lower
overhead so yeah and I feel like this is
gonna appeal to a very niche market
anyway someone who's looking for a small
tiny little systems trying to be
lightweight and and you know small
footprint as possible what's unfortunate
about this particular card is that it
looks like it is not factory overclocked
from any markings that we can tell on
the box which means that it's probably
gonna be it's probably gonna
underperform compared to the founders
Edition r-tx 2070 which which is more
common but that would also mean if it is
shipping at those base clock speeds that
they could sell it for 500 bucks the
lowest price that you're allowed to sell
2074 true yeah and striction czar you
have to so that would also mean that
would use the not - a version current of
the GPU yeah so yeah and you could still
overclock it and stuff but hopefully you
you know they would sell it for I think
I think this article also mentioned that
that we're expecting this card to come
in as soros pricing is concerned at the
low end of the r-tx 2070 so you know you
kind of get what you pay for it kind of
balances out there the other thing was
there's no display link some people will
care some people won't notice play link
on the rear i/o 480 arm so if you were
planning to connect a next-gen VR
headset this isn't an issue now because
even current gen VR headsets don't have
that yet
but if you were planning to upgrade to
something later than the line you want
to do some VR with this card which would
make sense for like a mini ITX build
right like a mini portable VR system
that'd be kind of cool
you can you won't you won't be able to I
should say it doesn't apply now shame
because it's something yeah most of the
70s have yeah and you even see like
laptops and stuff you know I people want
to do VR on the go or be able to bring
their portable you know light stations
and stuff and ndu VR wherever and this
would be a prime candidate for it could
obviously drive the games no problem but
without displays just an interesting
design movement they're probably just
using again to cut down costs which is
again why we're expecting this card to
come in at a low price point for the
r-tx 27 B's so there you have it let's
move on to some non GPU related news we
only have one more article here before
we move on to the next segment this is
from hexxus and this is pretty 8 kind of
exciting interesting Xbox one keyboard
and mouse support is finally arriving
tomorrow it's fun if you're watching
this on live if you're watching us live
right now or the day of upload which is
November 13th November 14th tomorrow is
when Xbox one players will be able to to
play certain titles with full support
with keyboard and mouse including
fortnight you notice there's a mouse
cursor in this video where right there
they couldn't have dragged it off come
on ideas have been captured from
something oh I G n you're slipping they
left the mouse cursor right there
0 out of 10 IGN oh oh my gosh ok I
shouldn't say any I shouldn't say
anything cuz I you know I've made I know
I'm not one to talk but that's that's
funny um alright so you know of course
we we favor pcs here not gonna lie
that's pretty obvious but anything that
we can do to help the the gaming
consoles get closer to a PC like
experience I feel like I'm all for it
you know I recently bought an Xbox one
to play Red Dead Redemption too and I
tried some workaround solution to use it
with an Xbox to play the game with a
sorry with a keyboard and mouse and it
it kind of fell short it really fell
short of a
of a PC experience so maybe in the
future we'll be able to play some Triple
A games like that on an Xbox one and
have it really feel more functionally
like a PC with the peripherals I think
that's one of the biggest things that
sets consoles apart from PCs is the
freedom to use the peripherals you want
and have full support there now like I
mentioned not every title is gonna be
immediately supported overnight there's
a very limited list of of games for xbox
one that will have support starting
tomorrow in fact there's only two
tomorrow fortnight pretty limited
fortnight and warframe but later this
later this month you'll you'll find
support for a bomber crew deep rock
galactic strange Brigade vermintide -
war thunder and x morph defense so it's
very limited but it's a start I guess
and you know depending on the sort of
lifespan of the Xbox one I guess there
could be a lot more titles and in the
future there's gonna be extended support
there's gonna be additional support and
children of morta dayz minion master
mode lighter bigger war face and war
groove support for those games are
promised in the future we don't have an
exact date on those as a little
disappointed see Red Dead Redemption -
on there curious about the name of war
groove it's like it's like it's like
world of war tanks and and dance dance
revelution combined you got to dance in
order to make your tank shoot or fade an
incoming barrage dance dance war groove
you know it's like combines death and
violence and war with dance and a beat
modern hip hop exercise
this is you're developing this game I am
it sounds exciting
low-key one of the developers for for
this hot and exciting and highly
anticipated title ok so this is this is
cool this is also why I one of the
reasons why I bought why I decided to
buy an xbox one for RT or two instead of
a ps4 was because I saw that Microsoft
was making this kind of push to make
make their platform a bit more similar
to a PC as you get to 1x I did I got the
1x so you know bit more hardware in
there more native support for 4k in
certain games and things like that and
yeah I noticed that they were including
things like free sync did they add free
sync yet I know that they were reporting
to they were trying to add free sync I
don't follow the console space closely
enough but I know I I shall we talked
about now I heard of some stuff about
them adding free sync support because
they do have AMD GPUs and and and
everything in there which I believe are
capable of supporting it I don't know if
it needs to be implemented on a per game
basis or not right but it just it just
seems like Xbox one X or Xbox one is
trying to push the boundaries for mr.
slick one says the Xbox does have free
sync yeah ok so um so I think because I
saw like you know I was like oh this is
kind of like is trying to mimic a PC
experience a bit more though says you
need use for easier freesync HDMI
display so you need to of course display
that supports precinct over HDMI sure
think so so yeah so at any rate it's
kind of exciting if you are an Xbox one
owner and you like keyboard and mouse
the best keyboard and mouse experience
on Xbox one will be available through
designed for Xbox mice and keyboards so
this is where it gets a little so
there's there's gonna be certain
peripherals that you can use that will
be optimized for Xbox one X it's not
like any keyboard and mouse you can just
plug and play and it's gonna be amazing
we don't know exactly how just
any old keyboard and mouse will will
behave with an Xbox one but there will
be designed for Xbox mice and keyboards
that will come equipped with a dedicated
Xbox key so the you know that Xbox
button that's on the the gamepad the
like certain keyboards and mice will
have that button on it that is that
might be it could be or actually that's
that's one of their existing that that's
a razor turret keyboard that's an
existing lap board so the article hexxus
is speculating that whatever cues yeah
whatever whatever exclusive design that
that razor comes up with that the
revealing at CES next year in January
will probably take some cues from the
razor their existing razor turret lap
board which is used for you know
optimized for the living room being able
to put on your lap and stuff like that
so yeah razor seems to be right now the
police think it was funny of corny of
this article razor was the exclusive you
know partner for designing peripherals
that would be compatible with the Xbox
one and then the following article that
I looked up was from overclocked 3d
saying that Corsair has now become the
latest licensed hardware partner with
with keyboards and mice for Xbox one so
it seems like these two companies are so
far at the forefront of adding support
for for keyboard and mouse peripherals
with the platform so it's a little bit
different though because it seems like
we're Razer is developing a new a brand
new keyboard and mouse for Xbox one
Corsair has existing hardware that will
support the Xbox one so like their k63
lap board ecosystem like the wireless K
six and three and their dark pro
whatever it's called mouse that's
supposed to already be officially
supported with the Xbox one so owners of
those peripherals right now can
potentially use those no problem in the
various titles I listed starting
tomorrow which is kind of cool
whereas if you're a Razer fanboy or
something like that you'd have to wait
till Razer actually released those
products probably sometime after CES
so at any rate the Xbox one is trying
for all intents and purposes to be an
act or like a PC and I can't really
fault them for that so yeah that's
pretty much it for that article and we
can move on to new segments what's next
take oh no sponsor spot sponsor spot yes
thank you very much to Toshiba for
sponsoring this episode of awesome
hardware with their new SSDs this is the
RC 100 there nvme drive which is a 240
gig capacity that was the one we have
here I don't even know if the box
because I already know there's no SS
teen here only because I've already used
it for a personal build up I'm
instilling you know which which is a
true testament to how much faith and and
trust I have in these drives using their
bi c CS flash made in-house it's a it's
a cheaper drive it's price per gig is
insanely good and you get stoked some
some relatively good good performance
out of these what do you have a that one
will do over a thousand megabytes per
second reads and writes
it's like fifteen hundred and a thousand
read/write I think it might be listed on
there
I know it's over a thousand it's not
though it's not
I know it's over a thousand for both so
yeah yeah it's a nice balance between
like it's a good step up over what you
get with the standard SATA performance
but it's you know it's not as high as
the crazy high-end stuff that costs
three times as much yes
yeah this is a TR 200 which is a little
2.5 inch SSD available in 240 gig 480 I
think there's also 960 gig version of
this and you off you will almost always
find this at the in the in a very
competitive range when it comes to price
per gigabyte for SSDs so I'm sure this
sticker is also very easy to just kind
of easily heatgun off if you wanted to
get a nice clean silver a-class silver
finish bitten beneath that too yeah if
you're not finished really very green
and black right builds
get that option aesthetics so guys
there's links to these in the
description right and yours seems like
copying them from their video there so
on top of things
see if you copy from pasted from my
video then they'll be my links yeah just
use it because I updated them I'm just
gonna use yours anyway okay that's
alright thanks to Toshiba for sponsoring
awesome hardware what do we got next
I don't know it's your half of the shit
I'm basing your legs give me a break
okay what's on the you know what's great
is it is it because the twitch delayed
they won't even have by the time they
look at the description they'll all be
there you're right of course
perfect take my money
alright yes you certainly do you slack
are you alright no this this new segment
I feel like I've done a segment similar
to this in the past but I don't know if
I just lost the official name but it's
called take my money now and it's
basically Paul and I giving you or
curating a list of tech deals
we're curating the list of tech deals
that we found on the interwebs and
bringing them to you this is
particularly relevant because we are
moments away we're weeks away from Black
Friday which is arguably actually almost
irrefutable II the biggest holiday tech
deal week of the year where you can just
finders detect the tech deal what what
did I just say am I saying words that
that make sense can people understand
am i speaking English proper no no
biggest holiday tech day week of the
year no I didn't tech deals did I say
tech days I don't think you said I
thought I said tech deals so yes a tech
day week it's that it's it's a Dave like
Friday yeah but okay but Black Friday we
all know Black Friday deals are way more
than now than just the day Black Friday
deals extend to the holiday you can
still find amazing like the same Dee
it's not better people who subtly calf
will want to get you to buy that stuff
many other days than just Black Friday
yes and you can find you can find great
deals the the whole Black Friday week so
what I wanted to do today was just
curate a couple deals that I found on
Amazon and Newegg in particular that
stood out to me and and I really just
tried to like look at at products and
deals that that really made me go wow I
I would recommend this to a family
member or a friend because I think this
is a really good deal especially if that
family member or friend was clicking the
link in this video to my affiliate code
affiliate account that is a good
disclaimer Paul I will profit and that's
how you spread the joy of the holidays
this this is it's the gift that keeps on
giving is giving me more money so this
is all been the segment is just a ploy
for me to to cash in and profit I profit
off of your stupidity and get any money
by buying any of these hey you could do
a take my money segment it's not it's
not side exclusive it's not psychic flu
this could be on site a it deals your
side being um so alright tech under it's
a good disclaimer though I've linked my
affiliate links to all these products in
my description so if you guys want to
check it out I will be getting a cut
back or a kickback for anything that you
guys purchase through these links
just so you know thank you Paul for
pointing that so but I'm not ashamed to
admit it because I really do think that
these are some pretty good deals now
Amazon is having an AMD risin 5 2,600
going for a hundred and fifty 999 right
now this is this is a pretty good deal 6
core 12 thread I mean not not too shabby
down from 199 so we're getting a $40
discount here just just to clarify this
is actually a price drop I believe from
AMD because it's a hundred and sixty
bucks across the board so if you hate it
yes Amazon for some reason you should be
able to find the 21 degree and Newegg
lots of different retailers for this
price that's true
I
this is this is like and I like if you
want to talk bang for the buck I think
this is the ultimate bang for the buck
right now when it comes to building a
computer a mainstream computer you can
game and stream with this at the same
time you're gonna get good gaming
performance yes you could eke out a
little bit more gaming performance your
low resolutions with with the 9700 K or
something like that
sure but 160 bucks for this is it's hard
to be it's but but I'm gonna be honest
here don't as you're watching this don't
check out with this product yet until
you've heard all of all of the items
okay from this segment because there's
like a bunch of people about to hit
check out right now see I'm on I'm an
honest I'm an honest man Paul it's good
I want the best for my viewers so guys
hear me out here next up we have an msi
be 450 gaming which is a obviously a be
450 motherboard so it has full support
for Rison first and second gen
processors including the 2600 that we
just featured 97 dollars down from what
129 so 33 bucks off 130 33 bucks off
doesn't sound like a whole lot but when
you're when you're talking about a
product that's starting at 129 that's
actually a large percentage that's just
been lopped off the top and obviously
this is a fairly reputable brand here
MSI there you know MSI actually did do a
pretty good job with the power delivery
for their be 450 motherboards Hardware
unboxed has a pretty thorough video
going over the B 450 boards and
performance and stuff the tomahawk here
actually if you guys are also interested
is the one that they recommended that
Steve recommended I use this just
recently a build it's only I like their
tomahawk pillars only 5 or 10 bucks more
it's got a bit more of a neutral color
scheme it's all grey and black and you
can actually overclock or power like an
8 core am 4 processor with this board
nice and it's 106 so there's some slight
differences between the two boards but I
think you'd be happy with either one but
consider either of those yeah definitely
and then um also we have a
SSST you line up for you guys there's a
one terabyte WD blue this is a SATA 3
base drives 2.5 inch drive 1 terabyte
for 140 bucks hundred and thirty-nine
for a single terabyte for a whole
terabyte that's so nice
I'm so glad SSD prices have dropped back
down yeah that's down from 190 guys 139
I mean you know I guess there's there's
always there's I think I feel like
there's pros and cons to waiting for
Black Friday deals on one hand like you
could get some amazing deals at the same
time it can be kind of stressful and I
feel like I feel like there's such
limited quantities for how for some of
these like far-out amazing deals that
you kind of have to line up like at the
front door digital the digital front
door just like you do at like a shopping
mall or you know a Best Buy or something
like that this is gonna be my benchmark
because SSD prices or something I I
watch closely I like higher capacity
SSDs to terabyte ones yeah 140 bucks for
one terabyte yeah I think that's I think
that's and this it's like a no-brainer
560 megabytes per second sequential
writes but yeah I mean he makes some
rima nominal SSDs there's no their game
changers you're not gonna find like
anything faster that's a SATA SSD right
so so cool for you all right yeah
definitely next up we have another SSD
actually the 256 gig silicon power SATA
3 two and half inch drive okay this is a
great boot drive option so if you want
to get like the WD blue is great if you
want to like store all your games on it
like a one terabyte is pretty good for a
steam library but this is great for a
boot drive I've actually used this drive
myself in several bills it's the it's
got SLC cache it's 37 bucks 38 bucks
which is one of the cheapest one of the
absolute cheapest 256 gig drive you can
find on the market and I I like the fact
excuse me
I like the fact that it's 256 gig and
it's that cheap it's not to it and 40
gig I know it's like not a huge
difference but it does matter having
those extra 16 gigs or whatever
it makes me happy well I feel like yeah
and I'm getting more price per gig at
that point so um it's a good option like
I said I've used it several times and
it's always been good now let's move on
to some new egg deals here and by the
way I need the links that you click in
the description there genius links
though they'll automatically redirect
you to whatever country that you're
you're watching from or whatever new egg
now remember how I said before you pull
the trigger on that risin 5 2600 just
make sure you listen to all my deals
first new egg has a risin 7 1700 X bear
in mind first gen rising but still 1700
X great chip for $10 cheaper then the
risin 5 2600 fitty it's $10 cheaper dang
dang dang dang dude you get 2 extra
physical cores guys 2 extra physical
cars a good deal I don't have any recent
memory of this chip being any cheaper
than it is now so if you're pure gamer I
might tell you to opt for the 2600 you
will get higher frequency out of that
and especially the hair just like don't
even need to overclock it frequency with
the EXIF are xfr - where's the fun in
that if you're gonna be doing anything
that's compute-intensive though if
you're gonna be rendering lots of videos
or streaming a streaming maybe if you're
gaming streaming on the same seat on the
same at the same time on this computer I
and this will probably vary based on the
game that you're playing and how
multi-threaded the game itself is as far
as leaving because most games are kind
of like 4 cores 4 cores were yeah it is
yeah but I I would be kind of curious
what to get what the streaming
performance would be the 6 core versus
the 8 core but I expect you to be able
to do both but honestly that's a really
tough call the 8 core a core first gen
resin for 150 or the 6 core second gen
Rison for 160 yeah that's a it's so this
is probably the best bang for your buck
if you're looking at overall raw CPU
performance yeah if it was a 1700 non X
then I would for sure say god damn
windows I was for sure say I'm for she
said present by seventy six hundred week
but with the X the X there I feel like
you get a little bit more except you get
it a little bit more push there it does
it does make a difference that's
interesting either way though
either way though you can't go wrong oh
the seventy-nine Rex actually chats
pointing that out
twenty-six hundred does have a cooler
has a race fire swing does not this one
doesn't that 1700 X no that is so cool
that's some to consider okay for sure so
that's definitely something to consider
yeah good good good call chat all right
let's move on though we've got a couple
more here aces prime be 350 plus okay so
the Asus prime be 350 plus is a
fantastic board now granted it's be 350
not be 450 so its first in raisin as
well but it does support second gen
rising chips any of the 2000 series
rising chips will slide in just fine
you'll still be able to take control or
or take advantage of you know what
honestly PBR but precision boost
precision boost 22.0 exif are 2.0 all
those all those technologies because
they're attached to the cpu themselves
not the actual chipset so even with the
be 350 board you still look at all the
Verizon to features for the most part so
this is a really good board I've used
this board probably more than any other
be 350 board here in the studio and it's
always been good to me I've had no
issues with it
I like the BIOS I think the BIOS is very
easily navigatable if that's a word and
if you want it if you want to overclock
though consider spending 15 or 20 bucks
more on either of the MSI ones that we
talked about earlier you know they
better power delivery yeah definitely
you can still overclock with these
boards you just won't be able to like
fully max out the potential of whatever
trip you're on and you probably wouldn't
be able to overclock and then do
sustained running at that overclock
speeds because you'll have the V RMS
actually start to throttle due to
overheating potentially depending on the
seat depending on the clock depending on
the CPU that you're using and especially
with the eight cores with this board but
like I said for 85 bucks it's got
everything that you want and I have also
used this board and
especially if you're just running at
stock speeds it's a solid choice yeah
okay and then two more here sixteen gig
kit this was the cheapest ddr4 16
gigabyte kit I could find on Newegg
actually between Newegg and Amazon it's
a team team T force Vulcan at 3000
megahertz it's actually not slow bank
transfers kappa maybe transfers whatever
mega transfers per second at $99 that's
it I thought this was a great deal it's
like 30 bucks at less than I've seen I
feel like for 16 gig kids yeah most of
the kids and you know what will this
work with Rison let's check the reviews
I would think so
you know Rising Sun Rise and memory
support has gotten so much better over
the last six months to a year and you
could probably even overclock it you
could probably even overclock it a
little bit maybe the 3200 or something
like that but I feel like at so this guy
ran with a be 450 motherboard and he got
it to run at 29 33 that's not terrible
for $99 yeah he still gave it five stars
five eggs here's a be 350 and a 2600 has
rock either had the round on the qvl
went to a straight stable 3000 alright
so like this is the this is people when
I when I'm looking at memory and its
memory that maybe isn't on qvl lists
Verizon in particular I would expect
this to be pretty compatible with Intel
because until it's a little bit better
about memory support running you but for
Rison if you want to plug it in and run
it at 3000 feet which is a good speed to
run Raisa net you kind of want to double
check so you might you might be a little
bit more hit or miss this guy is not
happy he has an X 470 set up in a 2600
it did not work so well but he ran mem
tests and found errors so he might have
just had faulty memory right here's a B
450 that worked all right it does look
like the people are getting this to run
at the rated speed with resin so good it
seems like you have a decent chance to
that at least and I feel like I'm not a
huge fan of personally this is all
subjective the way that it looks
the side but if you look at the middle
picture there it actually looks pretty
good from the top like if you look at
just let the top which is what you're
gonna be seeing 90% of the time it looks
pretty it looks like some pretty
nice-looking sticks there I'm in its
color neutral color neutral matches
anything oh alright and then the last
item here that I have is the corsair
carbide series 275 R which is a mirror
oh they actually increased the price it
was it was $49 and now it's $55 so since
since a couple hours today
it went up five dollars with mail-in
rebate but still fifty fifty five
dollars for this case doesn't seem like
a terrible deal it's originally MSRP at
75 so this is still 20 20 $20 off for a
very sleek and modern looking case you
get tempered glass
no that's acrylic oh is it acrylic
Derrick alright so if you're ok with
acrylic then sure but honestly I thought
it was tempered glass I didn't see that
at least it's got a power supply
basement if you want something that's a
little bit more especially with five
dollars more I would say check out the
fantex p400 fantex p400 is gonna cost
you a little bit more then you know 55
65 but you can still get it for a
reasonable amount seventy-nine sixty
sixty-nine dollars right there is
actually a pretty good deal 70 bucks
the P 400 and that's RGB so you can
change that black red what oh wait just
go with black the black should be the
same same color but it's what goddamnit
alright well if you're going with it a
dedicated color scheme he bucks after
ten dollar rebate though so okay so
depending on you know how picky you are
with color and stuff you can eat so you
could save a $10 potential potentially
but the p400 is is an excellent option
tempered glass actual tempered glass
great power power supply basement good
cable management and pretty decent air
flow as well
a seemingly closed up closed off front
panel so uh that is it for take my money
again links in the description below
guys anything that you guys fancied to
go ahead and check it out and I think my
computer's frozen it looks like the
splash screen has probably been there
for the last ten minutes so I'm going to
casually leave with the computer normal
for a Windows Update just no problem
there I love it I love it I love it's
all anyone in chats been talking about
for the last however many minutes
alright every we're done with that
segment after party so we can we can do
after-party now so guys that's gonna
conclude my segment or might my half of
the show thank you very much for tuning
in we're gonna do an after party Stoke
go anywhere it's gonna be on my channel
you can find a link for that not in my
description actually if you just go to
my description it's in it's in Paul's
description or I'll put the description
there in like five seconds and then you
can check there so refresh refresh
refresh don't refresh yet those don't
we're fresh yet I hate you all just give
me a second
oh wait where's my where's my video okay
here we go
boom after-party I'm gonna list it after
party I love doing shit live alright now
if you refresh if you refresh now you
can go to my description you will see a
link to the after party where Paul and I
will read off donation comments and
shout johnson at you
and who knows what else i'm gonna
translate more over watch he's gonna
play if i play video games okay alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
