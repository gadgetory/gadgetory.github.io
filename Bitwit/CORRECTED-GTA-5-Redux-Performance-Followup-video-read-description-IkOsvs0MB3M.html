video it means that I have royally effed
up in my last video which was the gta5
Redux performance test where I actually
had vsync enabled during the benchmark
run for the Redux preset and that's a
no-no if we're testing things we always
want vsync to be off obviously we don't
want to lock our framerate and I
actually just completely overlooked this
because there's a separate menu within
the mod itself you have to hold shift
and then hit enter and it brings up this
whole other menu or you can like select
different Ian B's and stuff so I had to
disable vsync within that menu and and
after that was off I reran the test so
what you're seeing now is the corrected
version of the side by side comparison
benchmarks with vsync disabled both for
the vanilla and the modded version of
the game so what we found was in the
vanilla version 73 average fps so you
know margin of error it's only two
frames higher than in the last video so
it's just I'm going to attribute that to
margin of error I also tested minimum
frame rates this time around so 39 fps
is the lowest that the vanilla mod I'm
sorry the vanilla version of the game
hit at any given point and then with the
modded redux preset we actually saw an
average of 69 fps and a min of 25 so
this is a much smaller gap on the
average frame rate front where we're
only seeing a four frames per second
difference going from vanilla to super
mod it out which is actually really
reassuring for those of you who want to
install this mod yourself however the
minimum frame rates took quite a hit
here we're seeing 14 FPS of a
performance gap we're actually seeing a
much lower frame rate which could lead
to some choppiness
in game if you're going to be gaming at
4k mind you with a similar setup as mine
but there you guys go those those are
the results that are now accurate and
hopefully I've rectified things for all
of you sorry for any confusion or
trouble that I may have caused from the
last video but hopefully this this
that's things straight have a going guys
I'm going to get out of here and I'll
see you all in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
