channel today we are assembling yet
another gaming rig but this one is much
different than all the other ones
because it features the latest and
greatest RGB lighting yes it's a
revolutionary technology we are just
catching wind of now and it's gracing us
with our presence in the most epic RGB
PC of 2018 ever you just have to add
ever to the end of any sentence and it
automatically sounds way cooler special
thanks to Thermaltake for making this
build possible they've provided every
inch of hardware that you see here and
let's quickly go down the list of course
specs I'm not gonna go over every single
piece of hardware here because that
would take forever but we are rockin the
x2 99 platform for today on a norris
gaming 7 motherboard from gigabyte slash
morris that's gonna be slotted with a 70
900 X core i-9 processor from Intel
featuring 10 cores and 20 threads
even though threaded / - just came out
and is technically a better Buy but
we're not here to talk about that we've
also got 64 gigabytes of HyperX predator
ddr4 at 29 33 crazy Ram solution there a
480 gig SSD from HyperX once again this
is their savage drive along with the GT
X 1080 from Oris once again from Oris
this is actually one of their special
custom water blocks already mounted onto
the GPU that actually saves us some time
and it'll look really nice as well and
powering the whole system we have the
thermaltake tough power I RGB plus
twelve hundred and fifty watt power
supply and the rest of the hardware you
see here I want to say it feels like
it's almost every piece of custom water
cooling hardware that Thermaltake
currently sells but that might not be
accurate it definitely feels that way
though and now you guys are probably
wondering what case could possibly be
worthy enough to fit all of this
glorious RGB unicorn ass hardware well
this is the Thermaltake level 20 20th
year anniversary computer chassis
oh my god why is it so big that's the
phrase I don't hear often alright so
this is where our build starts with the
motherboard getting it all prepared the
CPU is already socketed actually a
thermal thick had already stuck it into
CPU and they shipped it over took me
like 20 minutes to find it until I
realized oh maybe it's already in the
motherboard and sure enough it was
anyway I'm digressing we've got memory
that we're gonna install and then the
rest is pretty much just gonna go you
know 0 to 60 for the most part the rest
of this video is probably gonna be
mostly b-roll in music occasionally if
we hit a snag or something like that
then we'll go ahead and talk about it
and then we'll carry on with the rest of
the montage but that's how things are
going on for now with that said let's
start off let's kick things off with a
ceremonial plastic wrap peeling as we as
we often do actually we never do that
what am I saying
here we go well nope no oh no it's
breaking into little pieces because the
vrm heatsink and shaped it's it's just a
bunch of little peels instead of one
nice satisfying this is the most
depressing just build the damn computer
okay the build is not complete yet but
we got a lot done you can see that we've
pretty much done every step except for
the tube ending and filling the loop
we're gonna save that for part two
because that'll probably take another
full day because I'm just not that great
at tube bending but it's looking good so
far we didn't have to interrupt the
montage at any point because things were
really smooth everything was pretty
straightforward getting it all installed
cable management has been fairly simple
for the most part except for when you
account for all the RGB connections that
we've had to make since almost every
part of this build has RGB in it at some
at some point so we actually had to bust
out like three different RGB controllers
there's three RGB controllers behind the
motherboard tray right now which means
we also had to bust out a USB 2.0 hub
because there weren't enough USB 2.0
headers on the motherboard so RGB has
been the biggest pain in the ass so far
for this build but again we haven't
gotten to two-bit to bending yet let me
quickly go over the runs because we sort
of figured out so far like what makes
the most sense this is not set in stone
by any means but it's just kind of the
best we can come up with as of now so
starting from the pump res we've got
some fittings here we're gonna cheat it
a little bit depending on you know time
and stuff we might use some soft tubing
just for this run going back and down
underneath the floor of the case so you
can't really see it you won't be able to
see any soft tubing if all goes well and
then it's gonna go straight up into the
GPU from the GPU it's gonna be all
hard-line from here straight up back to
the CPU CPU block out there's gonna be
the most difficult run I think of the
whole bill just gonna go out up all the
way to the right through these two
grommets that are connecting these two
chambers together and then from there
it's gonna go up and then back into the
radiator from the radiator it's gonna go
out and then straight down to the
reservoir so for this long sort of fu
tube or Bend that we're gonna have to do
we may employ the the use of some of
these burnt macaroni pieces or elbow
fittings ninety degrees or whatever just
to help us not have to bend so much
otherwise we could burn through a lot
and a lot of tubing but that's the build
so far you guys let us know what you
thank thanks again to Thermaltake for
making this possible and make sure you
guys stick around for part two when we
to fill up all these holes with our
special fluid I'm gonna cut the video
off now before it gets worse
thank you so much for watching guys toss
a like on the video if you enjoyed it
you can also get subscribed for more
tech stuff right around the corner also
feel free to check us out on floatplane
if you'd like to watch our videos a week
early without ads for 3 bucks a month
I'll put a link for that in the video
description til next time thanks for
watching have a good one and I'll see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
