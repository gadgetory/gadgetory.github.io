watching part 2 of my silent night
gaming pc mini-series if you will where
in part 1 we actually built a system
that's really tailored for acoustic
magic it's supposed to be as quiet as we
could possibly make it and I even gave
you a taste in part 1 of how quiet it
was granted at idling even though you
the camera was inside of the computer
you guys were also hearing it through
the the crappy point my point and shoots
built-in mic which isn't very great but
we're actually gonna do a proper
acoustics test this time around with my
fancy-pants Anheuser microphone and last
but not least we're gonna take a look at
thermals because no matter how quiet the
system is it doesn't really matter if
things are overheating and shutting down
or frying god forbid so we're gonna take
a look at all that starting with the
acoustics test but what if I told you
that you're already listening to the
system under load right now from within
the computer yes that's right you have
been inside of the computer this whole
time and it has been actually running
the Metro like Metro last light
benchmark since the beginning of this
video so um yeah you guys probably heard
a little bit of buzzing maybe some
electrons firing in there but let me get
you out of here it's probably a little
uncomfortable here's a look of the
system that you were just in you've been
inside of a computer like like that much
inside our computer probably not right
and here's the Metro last light pumping
away so obviously you guys might have
been hearing a little bit of fan noise
or buzzing since the start of the video
but probably not convinced that you were
actually inside of a case it's just a
clear indication of how a court shut
that dog up this is a great indication
of what's to come with our official
acoustics test so why don't we get that
started right now
all right it's not too shabby a so yeah
you can see this is clearly a really
really quiet system you probably heard a
little bit a little bit of noise but you
probably heard the traffic out my
outside my window even more than the
actual system under load so that's
really awesome I probably should have
also started this video off with my
testing methodology before jumping into
the acoustics test but you know how I do
so why don't we just go ahead and go
over this really quick I did dial in a
moderate overclock on the 960 at 120
megahertz boost for the the core clock
and then we've got a 50 megahertz boost
a smaller one for the memory so total
we've got about we hit 14 86 megahertz
at our maximum clock speed and we did
dial in oh I didn't dial in but an
assigned dialed in its automatic
overclock using their their handy-dandy
gaming app obviously a really modest
overclock we could have pushed it
further tweak the voltage a little bit
and done some more things but I just
wanted to give a really quick example
here so 40 100 megahertz ain't too
shabby and why don't we take a look at
the temps when we take a live attempts
this is this is where it's at folks so
you can see right here 6600 K core i5 we
got our four cores and the hottest we
got was 64 degrees Celsius and that's on
only on the hottest core average average
we're looking at you know anywhere from
57 to 58 degrees Celsius which isn't too
bad for a for a semi passive you know
CPU cooler without any attached fan so
that's actually really good
and then the GPU the Twin Frozr 5 cooler
on the 960 from MSI is actually really
good at keeping thermals down to a
minimum so 67 degrees Celsius there and
that was with the side panel on I made
sure to do testing that way so overall
this has been a success I would call
this a success what do you guys think do
you think do you think the silence do
you think these may be slightly higher
temperatures from from you know so few
fans and limited cooling in the case
might might cost you a little bit of
degrees there but overall do you think
it's worth having that silent silent
operation for a few degrees of heat I do
want to hear from you guys so leave some
feedback down in the comment section
below and I will be sure to check all of
them out and thanks for watching
toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it feel free feel free to
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already I love you all have a very Merry
Christmas
miss well actually if you're watching
this Christmas is already over so have a
very happy new year and make sure you're
safe
don't drink and drive call a freaking
cab or uber whatever and have fun have
fun but be safe I don't want any of you
you know showing up dead on Twitter or
something like that following day that's
really morbid to think about but thank
you so much for watching I'll see you
guys really soon in the next video take
care I love you I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
