watching part 2 of my silent night
gaming pc mini-series if you will where
in part 1 we actually built a system
that's really tailored for acoustic
magic it's supposed to be as quiet as we
could possibly make it and I even gave
you a taste in part 1 of how quiet it
was granted at idling even though you
the camera was inside of the computer
you guys are also hearing it through the
the crappy point my point and shoots
built-in mic which isn't very great but
we're actually going to do a proper
acoustics test this time around with my
fancy-pants Anheuser microphone and last
but not least we're going to take a look
at thermals because no matter how quiet
the system is it doesn't really matter
if things are overheating and shutting
down or frying god forbid
so we're gonna take a look at all that
starting with the acoustics test but
what if I told you that you're already
listening to the system under load right
now from within the computer yes that's
right you have been inside of the
computer this whole time and it has been
actually running the Metro like Metro
last light benchmark since the beginning
of this video so um yeah you guys
probably heard a little bit of buzzing
maybe some electrons firing in there but
let me get you out of here it's probably
a little uncomfortable here's a look of
the system that you were just in ever
been inside of a computer like like that
much inside our computer probably not
right and here's a Metro last light
pumping away so obviously you guys might
have been hearing a little bit of fan
noise or buzzing since the start of the
video but probably not convinced that
you were actually inside of a case it's
just a clear indication of how a court
shut that dog up this is a great
indication of what's to come with our
official acoustics test so why don't we
get that started right now
all right it's not too shabby a so yeah
you can see this is clearly a really
really quiet system you probably heard a
little bit a little bit of noise but you
probably heard the traffic out my
outside my window even more than the
actual system under load so that's
really awesome I probably should have
also started this video off with my
testing methodology before jumping into
the acoustics test but you know how I do
so why don't we just go ahead and go
over this really quick I did dial in a
moderate overclock on the 960 got 120
megahertz boost for the the core clock
and then we've got a 50 megahertz boost
a smaller one for the memory so total
we've got about we had 1486 megahertz
at our maximum clock speed and we did
dial in oh I didn't dial in but MSI
dialed in its automatic overclock using
their their handy-dandy gaming app
obviously a really modest overclock we
could have pushed it further tweak the
voltage a little bit and done some more
things but I just wanted to give a
really quick example here so 40 100
megahertz ain't too shabby and why don't
we take a look at the temps when we take
a look the temps this is this is where
it's at folks so you can see right here
6600 ky5 we've got our four cores and
the hottest we got was 64 degrees
Celsius and that's on only on the
hottest core average average we're
looking at you know anywhere from 57 to
58 degrees Celsius which isn't too bad
for a for a semi passive you know the
CPU cooler without any attached fan so
that's actually really good and then the
GPU the Twin Frozr 5 cooler on the 960
from MSI is actually really good at
keeping thermals down to a minimum so 67
degrees Celsius there and that was with
the side panel on I made sure to do
testing that way so overall this has
been a success I would call this a
success what do you guys think do you
think you think the silence do you think
the maybe slightly higher temperatures
from from you know so few fans and
limited cooling in the case might might
cost you a little bit of degrees there
but overall do you think it's worth
having that silent silent operation for
a few degrees of heat I do want to hear
from you guys so leave some feedback
down in the comment section below and I
will be sure to check all of them out
and thanks for watching
toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it feel free feel free to
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already I love you all have a very Merry
dismiss well actually if you're watching
this Christmas is already over so have a
very happy new year and make sure you're
safe don't drink and drive call a
freaking cab or uber whatever and have
fun have fun but be safe I don't want
any of you you know showing up dead on
Twitter or something like that following
day that's really morbid to think about
but thank you so much for watching I'll
see you guys really soon in the next
video take care I love you I love you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
