be quiet is finally here with a modular
design for ultimate flexibility silent
wings 3 140 millimeter pwm fans
outstanding water cooling support and so
much more the white edition is available
in limited quantities so catch it before
it's gone you can learn more by clicking
the link in the description below what's
crackin people welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well
today's video is going to be very
haphazardly thrown together because I'm
short on time what else is new Kyle I
know so apologies in advance for that
but I still think the data that you're
gonna be seeing today is is going to
excite you without giving too much away
so today marks the launch as I'm sure
most you know of the gtx 1070 TI a card
that we didn't even really asked for or
know was coming but here it is in the
flesh i actually did it live unboxing of
this particular model earlier this week
this is the EVGA superclocked black
edition 1070 t i did the unboxing with
whyphy sauce you guys can go ahead and
check that out for more information on
this card but the long and short of it
is that it's got a single 8 pin
connector no back plates unfortunately
and it looks really nice it's black and
stuff that's why it's the Black Edition
of course you can sli these guys at the
2 way and you can check out all the
other specs either on their product page
which I'll link in the description below
or on that unboxing video that I just
mentioned so the question is or first
off there was a lot of speculation or
doubt if you were even going to be able
to overclock the 1070 TI and then later
we found out confirmed from Nvidia that
you can in fact manually overclock this
card and since it's really a stopgap
between the gtx 1070 and 1080 the
question I'm trying to answer today is
if you overclock the 1070 Ti can it
outperform or at least match the
performance of a GTX 1080
running stuck so today we're going to be
comparing it against the spanners
Edition which many of you guys might
think is an unfair fight because we run
a reference cooler versus an adhan board
custom variant but I just wanted to use
this as a as a reference point because
it is sort of universal the founder's
Edition is everyone's familiar with this
particular card it hasn't really been
touched by adding board partners of
course so I think it'll still prove for
an educational comparison now getting
into some of the gritty details here I
was actually able to take our core clock
speed up 135 megahertz that was our
offset that we got away with
with a 300 megahertz offset on the
memory clock it's actually not too bad
and considering that this only has one
disabled cluster over the GTX 1080 I'm
thinking that we can probably get away
with this guys I think we can get pretty
close within 3% perhaps is my estimate
this is my educated guess of what this
card is able to achieve running stock so
I think that was a pretty good overclock
temperatures were also fantastic on this
card granted the ambient temperature in
this office is pretty chilly as is
around 18 19 degrees C so actually under
lobe you are seeing no hotter than 70 C
on this particular card which is really
really nice and of course compare that
to the 82 degree Celsius that the
founders edition 1080 will hit within
seconds pretty much of sustaining a load
and that also goes to show that we can
probably even get higher clock speeds
from an a/b comparison testing with GPU
boost just accounting for the additional
thermal Headroom that this card has over
something like a Founders Edition so
bear that in mind as well as far as our
testing hardware goes we've got an 87
hundred K running completely stock I
have not touched it whatsoever that's
being cooled by a cooler master master
air maker 8 which is a air cooler of
course a very nice tower deed that's
gonna be on top of a Z 370 horas gaming
7 motherboard from good old gigabytes
paired with 16 gigs of Ripjaws v ddr4
3200 speed a one terabyte SanDisk SSD +
and a dark power pro 11 850 watt power
supply using the LAN Li open air test
bench on a final note I was using the
latest vehicle drivers that are publicly
available on the GeForce website for the
GTX 1080 and the press drivers that
Nvidia gave me for our 1070 Ti here and
I did run this card stock as well so we
can kind of see the performance jump
from from doing a manual overclock let's
go ahead and take a look at our
benchmarks so starting out with 3d mark
firestrike extreme we can see the gtx
1070 TI when running stock pretty much
gets beats out in both our graphics core
and our overall score from the GTX 1080
founders Edition but once we overclocked
you can see we actually outperform the
GTX 1080 now and it's kind of
interesting we actually broke 10,000
points from overclocking our 1070 Ti
whereas our 1080 just fell
word of that 10,000 mark so that's
actually a nice sign of of what's to
come and I should have mentioned this
earlier that I'm only running three
titles here
but apart from 3d mark and that's just
because I was again short on time but
fortunately I did test multiple
resolutions at 1080p and 1440p so
starting with ashes of the singularity
at 1080p we kind of see the same sort of
situation we saw in the fire strike test
where 1070 TI stock is really no match
for the 1080 but as soon as we
overclocked that sucker we're actually
right neck and neck with a founders
edition 1080 just pretty exciting we
actually beat it out by 0.1 frames per
second on average I should mention the
reason why we only have average frame
rates here and no frame times is because
we're testing DirectX 12 with this
particular title and I don't currently
have a monitoring software that supports
DirectX 12 I know I'm Way behind on that
but still this is a pretty telling
benchmark here if we move over to the
same game at 1440p we see very similar
results with the 1070 TI overclocked
just barely I mean this I would call
this pretty much a match between it and
the GTX 1080
founders edition runnin stock again the
1070 TI falling slightly behind moving
over to GTA v at 1080p this is tested
with very high - high settings there's
kind of a mixture because there's so
many different variables that you can
configure in this game no MSA no MSA a
was used but you can see here we're
actually running into sort of a CPU
bottleneck because regardless of which
GPU were using or if we're overclocked
on our 1070 Ti we're pretty much getting
the same results across the board for
some reason the 1070 TI running stock
actually had slightly higher 1% than
0.1% lows not exactly sure why that is
but you can see here that we're pretty
much getting 102 101 FPS on average
across the board and that pretty much
continued over to 1440p serious CPU
bottlenecking in this game because it's
just so processor hungry again 102 101
FPS on average although the one percent
in point one percent low is bumped up
from the from the lower resolution which
again is kind of odd that also goes to
show though if you're playing a lot of
GTA 5 just go to the 1070 over or a 1070
TI over a GTX 1080 because it seems
the performance is pretty much the same
now finally with Metro last light at
1080p we're using max settings with no
physics and we're again seeing a very
similar behavior this is a repeatable
result at this point where the 1070 TI
overclocked is I would say right on par
with the GT X 1080 founders edition
running at its default or stock
frequencies I would the 1070 TI running
stock falling slightly behind but that's
a pretty nice overclock going from
jumping from 135 to 144 FPS from dialing
in those offsets and then finally at
1440p in the same game we're again
seeing the 1070 TI overclocked match up
with our 1080 which is great news
naturally our 1070 Ti running stock
falling slightly behind for the record I
would say the 1070 TI if you are
planning to overclock definitely holds
the higher priced performance over the
GTX 1080 at least the founders Edition
that we've tested out here well guys we
actually did it we were able to
overclock a gtx 1070 TI custom variant
mind you into performing on par with the
GT x 1080 founders edition that's pretty
cool and whether or not you guys think
that this card should even exist because
again it is sort of a weird stop gap
between the 1070 and 1080 at the end of
the day we're still getting performance
on par with a 1080 for significantly
less money and I can't really find a way
to argue with that right now so that's
pretty cool guys let me know your own
thoughts I would reckon that a higher
tier 1070 T I would even outperform a
custom 1080 variants so that's pretty
exciting as well guys let me know does
this launch make sense to you are you
excited about it do you think it's
stupid let me know in the comments below
and as always feel free to toss me a
like on the video if you enjoyed it also
feel free to subscribe to the channel
for more tech stuff coming at you really
soon guys thanks again and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
