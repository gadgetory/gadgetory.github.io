channel hope you're all doing well
so AMD recently launched their Rison 3
lineup which is a budget oriented CPUs
positioned to compete pretty much with
Intel's Core i3 family and we're going
to be taking a look at two of the new
SKUs today actually the only two SKUs
that are currently available within
Rison 3 the 1200 and the 1300 x the 1300
x being priced at $130 retail and the
1200 slightly lower at 110 spec wise
they're very similar to each other
they're both native quad cores with no
SMT so there's only 4 threads on each
chip and they both have the same 65 watt
TDP where they really differ in terms of
specifications is the bass boost and XF
are frequencies that they ship with with
the 1300 X of course being slightly
higher of course I was able to overclock
both of them to 3.9 gigahertz no problem
without touching the B core voltage in
any way so that's really nice so one of
the things we're going to be looking at
today is whether or not there's any sort
of in-game performance difference
between the 1200 and the 1300 X in case
you were curious about Reisen 3 and
interested in purchasing one of those
chips is the extra $20 worth it for
1,300 X's if you're primarily going to
be using these chips for gaming we'll be
taking a look at that but primarily the
focus of today is to see how much GPU
horsepower these chips can actually
handle before we hit a CPU bottleneck
and you get hit with essentially heavy
diminishing returns obviously if we pair
to GTX 1080i with this with these you
know sub $150 CPUs theoretically that
would cripple our GPUs performance so
much to the point where it wouldn't even
be worth the premium price that we're
paying for it so we're going to be
taking a look at 6 different cards today
6 different graphics cards being paired
with both the 1200 and the 1300 X so it
should be pretty interesting we've got a
pretty nice lineup going from the msi
gtx 1050 TI the asus strix
RX 570 a power color Red Devil rx 580 a
GTX 1060 founder's edition gtx 1070
founder's Edition and lastly an EVGA GTX
1080 for the win a very nice range of
current gen graphics cards all of which
will be running overclocked for today's
tests including both of our CPUs those
are each going to be running at 3.9
gigahertz so an identical frequency
again giving us a nice apples to apples
comparison to see if there really is any
performance difference in games between
these two chips other testing hardware
that we've got on the board here include
an Asus Prime be 350 plus motherboard
but the latest driver
I'm sorry BIOS that was just updated a
couple days ago to the latest version
we've also got 8 gigs at the dual
channel kit of Ripjaws 5 ddr4 at 29 33
it's actually natively a 2800 kit but I
overclocked it in the BIOS to 29 33
that's running stable we've also got a
hellfire m2 SSD nvme drive from patriot
as well as this HX 750 watt power supply
from corsair it's actually outside of
the case right now because the power
supply that's in there doesn't have
quite enough wattage to drive the
higher-end graphics cards it's
definitely an eyesore but it shouldn't
affect our results today we'll be
testing five triple-a titles in 1920 by
1080 that's the only resolution we're
testing today just to help us spot any
CPU bottlenecking that might occur will
also of course be using the latest
drivers from both GPU camps so on that
note let's go ahead and take a look at
our benchmarks diving right in with
ashes of the singularity we can see our
rising three processors scaled pretty
nicely all the way up to the GTX 1060 at
which point anything past that results
in a massive CPU bottleneck and we
pretty much don't get any additional
performance even though you're forking
out quite a bit more cash for a GTX 1070
or 1080 rising three teams to pair
really nicely with the GTX 1060 here
giving us a 27% boost in average frame
rates over the GTX 1050 Ti and the RX
570 you can also see here that there's
virtually no performance difference
between the 1200 and the 1300 X when
paired with the same GPUs and we'll see
if this trend continues in the other
titles in Doom we see some nice
incremental scaling from our entry-level
GPUs and then a whopping landslide with
the GTX 1060 scoring over 66% higher
performance than the GTX 1050 Ti at 120
frames per second additionally unlike
ashes of the singularity there's still
some performance to be had here above
the GTX 1060 you can see we've actually
scored 21% higher with the gtx 1070 over
1060 when paired with either Rison 3 CPU
until eventually we get stonewalled by
the GTX 1080
as we see no additional performance
increase at that point as a little side
note we are testing doom in OpenGL which
might explain why the GTX 1050 Ti is
edging out the RX 580 and 570 if we were
to switch over to Vulcan perhaps we
might see the tides turn but that's of
course a topic for another video here
again we're seeing very little
performance difference between the risin
three CPUs regardless of which GPU were
pairing with them whether it be on the
low end or high end it seems like the
1200 is giving the 1300 ex a run for its
money when it comes to gaming
performance GTA 5 a heavily CPU
intensive game shows us results similar
to what we saw with ashes of the
singularity with the GTX 1060 seeming to
be the highest graphics card we should
be pairing with Rison 3 anything above
that just becomes an utter waste the GTX
1060 performs 19 percent better on
average than the rx 580 and the GTX 1050
Ti in Metro last light we see some
impressive games with the rx 570
performing 35% better on average than
the GTX 1050 Ti and then of course the
rx 580 outperforming the rx 570 by about
8.4 percent the GTX 1060 outperforms the
rx 580 by a very slight margin of course
this isn't an indication of a CPU
bottleneck by any means because these
cards are just naturally around the same
performance when given a strong CPU of
course when we get to the gtx 1070 we're
only outperforming the much less
expensive 1060 by about 5% and this
equates to some serious diminishing
returns when you factor in the price
difference between these two geforce
cards finally in watchdogs 2 we see some
pretty nice scaling going from the 1050
Ti to the rx 570 to the RX 580 the 580
performing 16% better on average than
the rx
570 we've also got a 7.5 percent bump
with our gtx 1070 over the gtx 1060
which isn't quite as slight as we saw in
metro but still not really enough to
justify spending that much more on a gtx
1070 on average it seems the gtx 1060
and the RX 580 are about as fast as you
want to go when it comes to pairing a
GPU with Rison 3 of course they're going
to be exceptions like doom where a GTX
10
is going to provide a significant
performance benefit over something like
a GTX 1060 but those instances seem to
be few and far between and if you really
want the best bang for your buck and
you're going to be playing a variety of
games I would say keep it to a gtx 1060
or below we're seeing some pretty solid
performance even all the way down to the
gtx 1050 P I of course these are Triple
A titles they're very demanding as is
and still rising three paired with a sub
150 dollar GPU is able to keep its head
above water in most of these titles
assuming you're willing to sacrifice a
bit of eye candy on a final note it
appears that when clocked at the same
core frequency there's little to no
performance difference in game between
the 1200 and the 1300 X based on these
results it seems to make more sense to
just go for the 1200 over the 1300 X
pocket that extra 20 bucks or put it
towards a faster graphics card in your
system for example and at the end of the
day you'll still be getting pretty much
the same results across the board again
if you're gaming I can't really speak on
behalf of other tasks besides gaming
because that's all we're testing today
but if that's all you're doing with your
system then the 1200 seems to be a great
bang for the buck option and actually
really seems to be the better buy over
the 1300 X when it comes to price to
performance so there it is guys overall
Rison 3 is stacking up to be a pretty
solid contender in the budget Desktop
CPU space and honestly looking forward
to testing it straight against some core
i3 products in the very near future so
stay tuned for that just to quickly
reiterate if you're just gaming I would
suggest going with a 1200 over a 1300 X
simply because from the results we're
seeing today there simply is just no
performance difference between each of
those chips as long as you're
overclocking your 1200 you can get it to
again three point nine very easily
without even touching the voltage it's
super easy it takes two seconds from the
BIOS to do so and you'll save 20 bucks
at the end of the day additionally I
wouldn't pair anything faster than a GTX
1060 or an rx 580 with Rison 3
regardless of which chip you're going
with anything past that point you're
pretty much going to be spending a lot
of money for very little performance
benefits in the majority of games so
hopefully that clarifies some things and
hopefully you don't mind how brief and
to the point this video was I tried to
keep it short because a life update
alert I'm actually in the process of
moving every tech thing that I owe
into a new studio I'm actually going to
be moving it with whyphy sauce tomorrow
actually take a look at this take a look
take take a look this is my product
shelf that's usually just you know
stacked to the ceiling with products
it's almost virtually empty let's see
what's going on over here let's see what
the wipey sauces up to in the living
room whoa hey how's it going oh there's
a cat well you look like I just walked
in on you like doing the nasty or
something
you look so guilty what did you do what
have you been up to you little scamp so
you can see it's just utter chaos right
now I'm glad she's enjoying yourself
while she's working but she's been
packing up stuff pretty much all day Wow
look at those boxes over there holy moly
so we've got a lot more work to do and
it's going to be really exciting though
once we're all moved in there will be a
vlog a moving vlog coming very soon so
stay tuned for that as well I haven't
done a vlog in a while so that should be
fun until then I'm going to get out of
your hair now guys so thank you so much
