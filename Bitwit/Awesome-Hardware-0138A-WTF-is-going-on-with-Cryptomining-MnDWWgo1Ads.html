they're I mean they're bulky if you're
really if you're gonna go deep-sea
diving or something it's very handy to
have then and your laptop is at the
bottom of the ocean yeah and water proof
and waterproof or perhaps just in some
sort of habitat do people we should be
live did to you you're right how you -
hey everyone welcome back to the show
this is awesome hardware episode 138
side egg so if you're watching this on
Twitch just stay where you are we'll be
streaming the entire show right here on
Twitch on TV TV / awesome our Twitter
friends out you got to pull it out flip
it over and put it back in there's a
large large animals pleasuring itself
then they not what you think it is but
if you're watching us on YouTube then
hello welcome welcome to YouTube and the
first half of this show will be streamed
on my channel and then after about an
hour so we're gonna switch over to
Paul's channel which is youtube.com
slash Paul's Harden where I've also put
a link in the description below so you
can just click click that once we're
done here and this is a fun kind of
casual laid-back tech news show in the
high bar we keep the main news that
you're leading with fun ok yes it sucks
this show turn Zak now it feels it feels
more comfortable expectation on
standards it is probably the worst tech
show on on the Internet with that said
it's the best show ever and I'm just so
proud of us on this show super pumped
you guys all you guys will enjoy it
hopefully we'd like to have a few beers
during the show so if you're of legal
drinking age feel free to drink along
with us
Kleenex makes our show more enjoyable
that's for sure Cheers and we do
occasionally use adult language so if
you have children around or people with
sensitive ears of the language warning
yeah yeah disclaimer disclaimer it's on
the line yeah yeah we're drinking a
little something ale right now from
Lagunitas brewery and we're going to be
switching in a moment to some ballast
point victory at sea porter mm-hmm kyle
was kind enough to pick this up on his
way over today i was i was super kind
super nice so it's a nice guy and my
wife is gonna take us to get sushi after
the
that which means I mean we're gonna get
sued so let's go ahead and plug each of
our stores because we salsa yeah yeah
and you guys sometimes have money you
have money and that's where you can
spend it you should spend all of your
money right now bitcoins worthless don't
bother with that just just go to a bit
Wake Tech slash store and buy every
glass shirt mousepad mug and decal that
you see and donate your bitcoins donate
all your bitcoins before you end up
owing Bitcoin money and then all the
money you save on taxes go ahead and
bring that to Paul store might be a bit
of an exaggeration
yeah I want to highlight just one of
your standard ass shirts today sure it's
very clean it it's exactly it's exactly
what I wanted like what is that it's
just a shirt that says bit with yep and
that's all its own only you'll know no
one ever and I'll think you're weird
anyways what is that English sure but
you'll be an insider what the inside
scoop lots of other stuff too Paul sorry
Burnett that's my story you can buy
stuff there too if you guys buy stuff
from our stores will shut out your name
no nope no detailed personal information
Bartholomew but then we'll yell Johnson
and it's all it's always lots of fun
thank you for supporting our show we
love you and then the other thing is
news to talk about tech news we have our
first segment which I didn't actually
get a chance to name it wait you already
had something oh oh you're right this is
good right this is cryptocurrency
cryptocurrency yes I forgot what the
name was so in the in the show doc I
just know currency which doesn't sound
nearly as cool cuz it's like see you Joe
it also completes the word period fancy
total and I play on words I made the
lower thirds really quickly which is why
it has the default all is like a word
wizard the yak in there yet gives me
that it's a it's a double entendre yes
yes it is see and these word wizard
again they large vocabulary um so the
first article is from Engadget and it's
about you guys probably heard about this
first off I just want to say this to
sort of you know as a prologue um lots
of lots of lots of things are happening
with slipped up currency right now the
sounds thought it's kind of all over the
place
and it's a it's an interesting time for
miners and anyone involved or affected
by this whole phenomenon really so with
that said there are a couple I have four
articles here each one more fascinating
than the last really trying to amp this
up other than just some silly select on
the show we should we should begin every
segment with a short speech yeah right
just kind of setting the tone yep
absolutely that's gonna set the mood
lights and candles all right so from
Engadget this is about the the some of
the US banks huge banks make up America
JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup well three
of those have all banned recently this
week the use of
actual bitcoins in the bank you can't
bring one of your bit cleansing yeah
yeah you're gonna have to you have to
get a Bitcoin check cuz that's the thing
oh my get credit cards yes yeah credit
cards have all been banned from these
companies from these banks to purchase
cryptocurrency so you can't swipe your
card for like you know a fraction of a
Bitcoin or cerium or anything like that
it's completely banned by these banks
these banks own lots of like sub
subsidiary companies that are credit
cards so like you can deco I don't card
with Wells Fargo it's like oh well
they're owned by I don't know if they're
owned by say I don't know some of these
banks have credit cards that like you
know it's not like a Bank of America
right so that this is actually affecting
millions and millions of people who may
potentially want to buy cryptocurrency
with their credit cards who now can't so
that's sad sad face feels bad man's
debit cards at Bank of America however
don't seem to be affected by the ban so
a little tidbit there there's money you
don't have to buy crypto basically yeah
because I kind of see it as a cash
advance right so there's more risks
involved with buying cryptocurrency that
the bank's just don't want to deal with
no I do not what to freakin update
Windows oh my god you really need to
pick some down time to do that
or just pray that one day there's a
remind me never option okay so yeah it
could this could potentially you know
having a credit card might lead people
to buy more coin than they can afford as
as Paul just mentioned and also there's
huge risks involving like hackers
and fraudulent thieves who might start
using credit cards to to buy
cryptocurrency of themselves and if
that's the case it's gonna be really
hard if not impossible for the banks to
sort of retrieve that money to get that
money back because it's all digital and
stuff so there's some issues that this
is posing and things are finally
cracking now Capital One there's more to
this than just these big these banks the
ones I just mentioned Bank of America
Chase Citigroup that's this week that's
this week but in the past already we
have Capital One Financial and discover
who do not allow who have not been
allowing crypto purchases with their
credit cards either and so it's a it's
really interesting there seems like
societies making it harder to mine
because mining is so potentially
lucrative and I feel like the banks in
the sense feel threatened by crypto
currency because it's literally it's
decentralized its descent its
unregulated money and the banks deal
with money and so I mean this is all
sound so obvious but yeah it's pretty
insane though there's a reddit post as
well that said that show that some major
some major credit card companies or
networks have recently changed their
policy and their terms and stuff for
digital currency purchases basically
listing them as a cash advance which
basically hits them with additional
charges and higher interest rates so
further making it increasingly difficult
for people with credit cards or credit
line of credit to just go out and buy 10
Bitcoin or something like that so that's
that's fun what do you what do you think
of that I think it's I if I was a miner
I'd be pissed
obviously I see I don't I
I always see things on every side I'm
too diplomatic
like I like I now that I like I have my
own business like I kind of understand
the banks I see what their what they're
doing is they don't have any interest
they're not doing in people's interests
like oh I don't want you to spend too
much money I don't you spend more money
than you have leave on oh you brought up
cash advances and usually with a credit
card you can use a credit card on goods
you know that accept credit card but to
get a cash advance the credit card
usually it's a it's a different rate you
pay you pay more a higher inch or how
your interest rate and that kind of
thing so you could still buy Bitcoin
with these credit cards you just have to
get a cash advance and then use that
somehow to buy the Bitcoin or right for
the cryptocurrency wanted to buy yeah so
we just cut into your and yeah and then
obviously you're gonna be paying a worse
rate on that so yeah yeah I don't know I
mean I'd also be interested it's just to
know how much actual money is being
spent with credit cards on clapping just
like is it is it is it rampant you say
yeah what caused that that takes it to
bubble up to 20,000 before recently
dropping back down or you know you know
it's interesting because like even
though like so I've considered mining
like I kind of have like this thing
where it's like I've considered mining
just to make content around more
educational than look at all this money
you can make or lose apparently but but
now I don't know now I feel like it's
being targeted so hard by these huge
companies that I feel like what if it's
not what if it isn't relevant like what
if it becomes irrelevant because Society
has just pushed it so far underground
that it doesn't have a chance of
sustainability or whatever so I don't
know I feel like this is also maybe good
news in a sense for gamers this article
that we're talking about because if it's
just if it's discouraging is that is
that a word if it's discouraged or if
it's discouraging let's play to confirm
that words with Cod the word wizard
confirms so I'm here for if if that is
the key
then wouldn't a lot of miners
potentially freak out and maybe start
selling their GPUs and you know
potentially giving us a flood of
second-hand graphics cards on the market
that might be sold for hopefully lower
than what they're already being sold for
I don't know we'll have to see it's too
early to tell but there's a lot more to
talk about here with cryptocurrency so
moving on to the next article Bitcoin
according to this article when it was
first written by CNN Money CNN Money
Bitcoin has fallen below six thousand
dollars in value just ahead of the
Senate hearing now before we continue on
here
apparently the Bitcoin value dropped 13%
today up to 13% dropping in below $6,000
for the first time in in months in like
three months
shut up guy now there was an update to
the article saying that the value has
increased now back to over 7,000 but I
think Paul has been keeping track or
keeping desk on the value goodies desk
it has changed yet again i refresh coin
desk here constantly work coin desk here
I also figured out I think I'm clean
desk when it was crashing and we're like
oh that's crashing so hard it's not
pulling up no coin desk if you're
running they run you block origin while
we're in it while we're on the show so
we don't give any egregious ads which is
just a safe thing to do anyway we
appreciate you guys if you whitelist us
but use it ad blockers it's much safer
these days true anyway the price though
7550 for turn okay right now alright so
I mean just this just goes just further
proves that just the Bitcoin value is so
unpredictable but here we can see it in
flow look at this unreal it looks like
it actually did dip below 6,000 just for
a moment a thousand 990 Tuesday at 8
about 8 that's today 8 a.m. this is UTC
so that's good see this is it's a
Greenwich is a Greenwich Time basically
yeah so it'll Greenwich at
it's time for a little bit yeah so um so
I guess that's good news kind of for
minors that II know if it goes down
whatever comes down
no no it's whatever goes up must come
down it's also bounced up and down so
much like people probably have different
perspectives on it if people look at it
like oh 20,000 like it peaked about
20,000 if people looking at it like it
can easily attain that again then
there's some people who are like let's
wait for it to dip and want you know buy
the dip and then when it gets yeah when
it goes low right then you buy it back
yeah but it is 6,000 the low or lower
than that right anyway yep yes I mean
like it's like it's like stock trading
it's a gamble
you're literally gambling on when you
think and how much you think the value
is going to change if something as to
whether you buy or sell that thing so
it's uh you know it's like I cos initial
coin offerings are pretty much like very
similar to IPOs where you have investors
buying out stock and it's like sort of a
form of security in a sense but this
isn't a CNN article so it's it's very
like you know see in any that's the
magic tip that I just made up wizard
word wizard will confirm but regulators
it's interesting from the political
standpoint because these these like
lawmakers don't know like should we
implement laws for crypto currency
because it's it's such a new uncharted
territory that it kind of needs laws in
the sense I mean it is unregulated but
that's also kind of what makes it cool
so I could see why there's a like why
there would be a lot of backlash for
like hardcore miners and just free
thinking people of the world in general
but we did have what's the dude's name
chairman Jay Clinton who's the exchange
commission chairman he was basically
saying that you know we may be back with
our friends from Treasury and the feds
to ask for additional legislation so
they might go back to the drawing board
and draft up some new laws surrounding
this issue because it's kind of crazy to
when
you know just two weeks ago a couple
hackers stole five hundred and thirty
million dollars from a Japanese currency
exchange so just things like that that
are happening there's mount GOx if you
go back back a couple years to yeah I
mean there yeah there's but I mean the
thing to bear in mind though when you're
talking about volatility of these you
know you know and the hackings that have
happened when you're talking about
hacking it's not necessarily that the
crypto currency itself is it is
susceptible to that that's usually like
the the you know it's a company that has
you know passwords that get out or you
know the right they're breached somehow
and they get internally and then right
you know they get ahold of the public
wallet or something like that and then
they but that could be a reason why
certain laws need to be put into place
yeah I mean I'm sure there's maybe just
to increase securities for one might be
a huge thing is there's probably some
level of perfect regulation that will
allow rip the currency to flourish while
maintaining a reasonable level of
control over taking advantage of it and
I'm sure where everyone is happy I'm
sure and I'm sure there's no government
in the world that will actually
implement something like that no no no
one would ever exploit rely on the
government for his common-sense
legislation yeah don't rely on the
reliability so yeah you get another
another news newsworthy topic for
cryptocurrency but not all is done here
that we might have some bad news here
depending on who you ask I guess this
articles from WCC F Tech no that's not
the bad news no hear me out on this they
they were speculating after a hard o CP
article came to light more like WCC F
wrecked whoa Rex it's also a burn wizard
Paul is today we also buy us so the
article from hard OCP is claiming that a
hike or count thread repre c4 you can
actually pay for itself through mining
in under a year or in a body
depending year to a year-and-a-half and
this is interesting because they found
that a 1950 X can hit a mining rate of
fourteen hundred and eighty three hashes
a second that's for bring your mind I
think belch clean I'll be expecting your
accessing your I cos an amazing hash
rate just through the roof with the 1950
X this is what we're saying here and
everyone should have best that's now
friends and burps so the future the
future of Finance so the other cool
thing is that in nineteen fifty X paired
with the DT X 1080 pumped out 2005
hashes a second at 335 watts which is
very impressive but this this actually
goes a bit deeper like there was a guy
AMD his name is Triola Damian tree lit I
don't know if I'm pronouncing his last
name right but he's basically a
Technical Marketing Manager for AMD and
he was saying he was explaining why rise
and Federer is good at mining
specifically and to be specific hardest
hard our CP was using the Kryptonite
algorithm for all of their testing
specifically crypt the Kryptonite
algorithm which is able to effectively
leverage the resin threader for
architecture and and what's his name
tryla was explaining that unit it's
really thread rippers massive amount of
l3 cache that that makes it such a good
mining chip with this specific algorithm
apparently the Kryptonite algorithm uses
two megabytes of l3 cache per mining
thread that's in use and the 1950 X has
32 megabytes 32 megabytes of l3 cache
and so the cash ratio per core is what
allows threader per be so effective with
this algorithm and and in the end
achieves such a high hash rate
and according to triolet he's saying
that the Red River paired with the
Kryptonite algorithm Nets nearly the
same return as our X Vega
I don't think on camera looks like
you're petting my backers probably does
just good a little rap in there oh yeah
yeah call those the butt scratches I'm
petting my dog here oh he's just he's a
very big dog but he's know that you can
see he's saying hey he's a cute dog ages
peaking out he's massive
he's like one of your dragons new dragon
dog he's a gentle beast his he snores he
snores and he's cute he's loveable but
he won't rip your throat out if he needs
to know when he's a big old dog when he
does his his his big boy bark okay
that's good anyway so yeah trail it
treeless you know this guy this guy and
he seems very supportive of mining with
just the way he's talking about it he's
actually suggesting end-users to build
not like a hardcore mining rig but just
like he's actually quoting like in the
article he's like you know what just
just build a high-end desktop so and
mine with an AMD marketing manager it's
suggesting that you buy and use AMD
products yeah but I mean AMD always even
then is CMD still always like it seems
like they always happen same time have
that gamers first mentality but you know
I guess it's more like profits first
does that kind of went out any cat came
out the window after the vago lunch that
is true yeah and right gamers right now
there's just so much money being thrown
and GPUs and technology in general when
it comes to crypto like you open what
yes I do
I stole it from you
but there's so much money being thrown
at it that like all the companies are
just throwing lots of standards that
they previously lived by kind of out the
window yeah retailers are who previously
would sell you know an MSRP or below are
you know just selling it way way above
that MSRP with graphics cards and that
kind of thing
I haven't seen that kind of thing
widespread in quite some time but true
it has now become the norm and there's
some debate there is to like alright if
the cards are selling for that much
where should the money go should it go
to the retailer should it go to the
manufacturer of the GPU the manufacturer
of the graphics card should it go to
some fourth party who buys it from the
retailer and scoops up a bunch of stock
and then realists that on eBay or
something like that I mean it's really
impossible to stop people from buying
graphics cards for lots of money cuz
it's happening yeah yeah like I don't
have an answer for that really neither
do i I I think that I don't know it
doesn't really matter where the money
goes because at the end the day it's not
gonna fix the situation for for gamers
primarily I will point out this this
stock photo here I thought I found kind
of like there's a Bitcoin here and then
they just took some really old crappy
hardware like it's dusty and you got
like gonna get over PCB is a very old
mother but it's probably ddr2 so there
is something in the PCI slot where do
you get that Bitcoin like there's that
there's been a few of them there was
some person who like minted some of them
and then that kind of thing and I want
one you can you can those are worth a
lot you can order them people like 3d
print stuff and yeah and whatever he can
like that looks an actual coin though
looks like he's actually pressed or
something yeah I know really early on
there was a certain number of them that
were actually made out of metal that
actually had the like an AK it was
actually a valid Bitcoin token or
whatever like the information it was on
it or maybe it was a wallet ID or
something I'm not I'm not sure what was
actually on that bitch yeah I wish I had
more details about that I'm remembering
a story that I read about maybe once but
let's
move on let's move one more let's move
on during our last article for about
cryptocurrency and stuff and I don't
know yet again this is this is could be
good or bad depending on who you ask
Samsung has confirmed that it's making a
an ASIC specific for mining this is an
article from TechCrunch and they said
that these ASIC chips will be able to
will be used to mined bitcoins
specifically or Bitcoin aetherium and
other cryptocurrency so other old coins
and stuff will fall into this category
this is information that comes after a
Korean media outlet claimed that Samsung
had partnered with an unnamed Chinese
distribution partner and this also
brings you know with with Samsung in the
game developing these Asics manufacture
these Asics it kind of brings
competition to that space currently
which is currently dominated by China's
bit main and Kanaan creative who are
both working with tsmc and tsmc is of
course benefiting from all this they've
actually reported that since the crypto
explosion they've they've added about
three hundred and fifty to four hundred
million dollars to their quarter
quarterly revenues geez over a billion
dollars a year from the Crypt just from
the crypto explosion itself orderly oh
yeah okay yeah it's insane
that's so you know it's it's unclear the
article says we don't know much about
Samsung's endeavor we don't know if
they're just gonna be focusing on the
ASIC specifically and if they're gonna
like outsource other companies or
manufacturers to make the actual
hardware or if Samsung themselves will
be coming to the market with with their
own in-house mining products we don't
know but for sure they're working on
mining friendly Asics I think this is
this is good in a sense may be good in a
sense for for for PETA for the PC
community before mining because because
now we'll have a dedicated mining
product whereas right now it's it's just
sort of a matter of like well which
coins leverage which components
and that's what determines what hardware
you're gonna go out and buy do you want
to go out and buy if you want to mind
Bitcoin well that just so happens to
leverage CPUs more than graphics cards
other altcoins maybe have to buy like a
bunch of graphics cards but these Asics
are going to be specific for mining so
maybe miners will because miners don't
care a miners really don't care they
don't care if it's a high profile gaming
card they're not they're not getting
high off of gamers tears right they just
want the the best hardware to make them
the most money that's the most most
efficient and whatnot so if their Asics
designed specifically for mining and
they're not optimized for gaming at all
then that could open up the supply to
some degree of gaming oriented graphics
cards for the rest of us who knows or it
can totally backfire and make the mining
craze even even crazier and then GPU
prices will continue to skyrocket and
what's the point of living anymore you
know it also varies on a case-by-case
basis to which cryptocurrency you're
talking about with some there's some
crypto currencies that GPUs are very
good at mining at there's some
cryptocurrencies that are like Bitcoin
you know the reason bitcoin is really
only mined on a six now is because it
was susceptible to Asics being designed
for it they could be very efficient so
that could mine Bitcoin very quickly
using very little power other
cryptocurrencies like aetherium for
example the reason the theory and of in
the past six months to a year gaining
popularity is because it was very it was
a very popular currency to be mined on
graphics cards and it was sort of basic
resistance based on how it was designed
so Asics are functional for some crypto
currencies but definitely not all of
them I guess okay I actually didn't know
that so that makes some sense okay well
I guess so so Asics mainly are in what
like what's an example of an ASIC an
ASIC is using have application specific
integrated circuits so it's just it's
when you look at GPUs and CPUs they're
designed to be able to handle a wide or
of different types of code that can be
that they can process that's probably
not the best way of putting that but
they're they're flexible to put it that
way
Asics are designed to do one job and one
job only so an ASIC that's designed to
mine Bitcoin hunt you can only do that
one thing but can do it really well
right whereas a CPU might be able to
mine Bitcoin but because it's designed
with all this stuff in there that can
handle you know different other
instruction sets or that kind of thing
okay it's it's not gonna be as efficient
as an ASIC gotcha thank you for the
clarification
all right so that pretty much concludes
our cryptocurrency segment
okay and guys sound off in chats what
you think about all this if you are I
think chat says let's stop talking about
cryptocurrency okay let's move on okay
we have another segment which is face
off
face up let's do some face off we
actually have not done a face off in
quite some time know why we've kept
postponing this one because other other
episodes just kind of ran long so I do
have I will do just go ahead and thank
share notes and those sudden movements
cause any issues for us actually you can
probably use that one and I'll just use
this one okay ooh this is a
unprecedented moment in face off history
folks we get our own keyboards well just
because that's that there's no ten key
on this one so uh you might be more of a
challenge for me alright so the game
we're playing today is rooftop snipers
and I've never I've never tested it I
never tested to make sure that this game
works and is a good game so you guys are
in for as much of a surprise as we are I
have no idea what to expect here the
music it's kind of funky fun I like it
yeah it's getting me pumped all right
settings
two players okay
Oh looks like him I was like a joke
right we can't we can't yell same cute
and I'm still gonna use this one
alright so okay jump w/e yeah we gotta
use our own key there are two buttons
jump and shoot okay it looks like a
physics game for how okay jump to dodge
hold shoot to raise gun let go to shoot
ah okay okay
she was easy sure I mean how how
difficult good P what what are we
betting every what is there anything yes
there is a the the punishment will be
that you have to you have to drink the
rest of your beer with a spoon oh that's
terrible
yeah just for this a pleasure that's a
really sucks yeah okay me too
and let's play okay oh you have to hit
hit your jump Keith I said signal that
you already know which keys jump oh god
yes
alright so what do we what are we
playing you should we also house the
side plus strong snipers that was a
pretty fast round just dropping people
what are we playing - let's do best best
out of 10 okay so whoever gets what six
alright alright ready oh my god Wow okay
you can get knocked off that easily
yep yep already go oh my god
it's taking a drink oh Jesus Christmas
there's a pause button there is yeah
yeah I already stopped that sucked
I like it I like it better when there's
civilians oh no no oh my god
one shot that's one hit one kill T and
what was that a run as market watchers
wait wait how come yours how come yours
went through the wall mine hit the wall
Clinton pain tears went through yeah I
think it's like whoever gets the first
shot it's like a what do you call it a
standout red yes so space Oh
cheating space party Thanks you will not
die before M you just gonna just go
launch myself at you at attack get out
of here Agent Smith time that's
game sucks bro people doing that's plays
of this game on you a very instruction
probably this is revolution are we gonna
change after today yep we're setting the
trend baby this is stop sending
civilians out I just jump to my death
listen estimate there wow house and
that's five well I was gonna say best
out of ten so the first of the first six
first to six that would be seven oh I
believe that seven alright really
no cuz you oh yeah I guess seven oh yeah
let's go but this ain't red wins yeah I
think it's they prefer us okay fine fine
I mean that was the trend it looked like
I was I was definitely winning they're
dominating right well would you like me
to go get you a spoon no maybe my wife
can grab one okay a big spoon
I probably ladle oops - I don't think we
have a ladle that would that would have
to pour the beer into the ladle so you
could you could just a big silver spoon
I think it was kind of the spirit of the
no no that's not practical is not fun is
that
practical is not or do you know what
let's like chat to side alright chat
which spoon should Paul use to drink the
rest of his beer for this half of the
show the large silver spoon or the
pretty ceramic oriental spoon oriental
what kind of soup spoon
whatever okay I'm half asian okay okay
we've got people it's also funny to see
what they're calling it I've always
thought the design is kind of silly
actually everyone is supposed to sit
flat like that yeah but then it's got
like it's got the the scooped out area
for the super whatever but the group
that's calling it a miso spoon are you
ever gonna use that like to do pour it
out is that the secondary function of it
to use it yeah yeah you put your mouth
below it so that it hangs do that it's a
good life that's how I'd review beer
then obviously the spoon has been chosen
I was kind of joking I still want the
other one oh whatever is more efficient
okay all right good get this Wow get the
cube it's gonna be very inefficient I
think you're just gonna have to like
pretend like it's a bowl of cereal like
oh isn't that beer splattered on various
parts of my of my little set here it'll
just look like you're constantly alright
like this is this that's not gonna work
just oh my gosh that's you're playing
with fire right here Oh
z this is a completely impractical
design it makes no sense this is why
this is why I've always been skeptical
of this is the spoon I mean I guess for
miso soup or whatever it might make
sense but Thank You Cal for grabbing
thank you for that brilliant livestream
moment did you wait did you really think
that was gonna work the little channels
too shallow right you get the for you to
work so slowly you get the point of
unrealistically slow needs to go on
crappy design silver spoon okay I used
it already if you don't mind okay just
just letting you know I'm not sick or
anything
okay well that's face off people that's
it you guys are asking like is there
nope in my PC this week there's no pen
my PC because they have lots of other
things to cover too many apart so let's
just dive into our next segment which is
just generic general tech news starting
with another article from WC CF tech
about G skills new tread NZ RGB kit
which is hitting some blazing fast
speeds at forty-seven hundred megahertz
on ddr4 this is gonna mark the fastest
kit available ddr4 kit available on the
market once it hits in a couple months
from now q 220 feet it doesn't become
more harsh with this bonus do you need
it to like air 8 or something what you
can handle it just pounding a beer no
problem they eat it out of a spoon or
drinking with the spoons
sipping cuz you're sipping and when you
sip it introduces like air right and
it's already kind of like her but if you
look if it bubbles up as I'm trying to -
it's impractical you got it you gotta
sip it slow
you gotta sip it gently I can't I can't
it's getting your soul patch okay so
very fast I don't know how I could focus
on techniques right now this is happy
focus Kyle so sixteen gigabyte kits in
you know two by eight gig sticks cache
latency nineteen all the way down to 39
at one point four five bolts and as
always the transi RGB modules are fixed
with Samson B die I see components yet
again I'm passing by W CCF Tech's
pictures I know it looks like it's been
rendered fifty times and I just like
this little part done here's in focus
and G skill appears in photos but I
don't know it's yeah it's weird that's
that's why they're a website and not a
YouTube channel perhaps yeah I guess
anytime I write stuff on in the YouTube
comments I can't spell so so you're
saying you're a much better
cinematographer than WCC f Tech is what
you're saying no sounds like I'm saying
that there are better writers than I am
ones like a challenge
that's like Kyle's no it's it's a lovely
it's a lovely out-of-focus picture I
will admit okay it's beautiful a lot of
beautiful in its own way XMP 2.0
supported oh good sleep and very fast
memory everyone should go buy one
gasoline 19 it seems a little harder
yeah it's forty seven forty seven
hundred so that's why and one point four
five volts
yeah some fast memory 4700
what's the maximum supported DVR for
speed or frequency for risin second-gen
i think it's a coin 200 like that's
actually validated yeah like spec wise
that's actually validated I don't know I
haven't looked at that recently because
I know with Verizon first gen it was
like 3,600 but it's been really
difficult to post at 3,600 so 3200 has
been sort of the the mainstream's
frequency that everyone's using with
Verizon first gen I think there's kits
that are higher that are faster than
3200 that are that are actually on
compatibility lists
I guess so now yeah I mean that that's
like you're so here is the difference
between like so if you want to get
memory at home and you're not much of an
overclocker and do you want to make sure
that you just get the CPU the
motherboard in the memory that all just
works and you want memory to be fast
there is basically you want to look at
the motherboard support list for that
because billions the motherboard
manufacturer has taken that specific kit
of memory and tested it with their
motherboard and you know arisin
processor if it's a name for motherboard
or whatever and made sure that that
works and if you get that memory one
installed it should work but then you
get beyond that and here like g.skill
has 4700 speed memory and 1g still is
saying is that on a platform that's that
that will that is able to run 4700 speed
memory this kit will be able to run at
4700 speed all the time right now to run
4700 speed memory you're gonna probably
need I don't know I guess you probably
idea to Intel Intel's a little bit more
flexible with running higher speed
memory and then I'm not sure what the
Intel AMC was something like coffee like
I don't know how reliable it is going up
really to really have frequencies but
you you might need you know a special
cherry-picked coffee like 87 or 2k or
something to run 4700 speed memory but
find that so you find that CPU that you
know
handle can handle they can handle that
that speed and then any kits that you
buy at 4700 speed from g.skill you just
wish it should work at that speed yeah I
was just wondering what the overall
platform maximum was because there's a
plan so yeah I mean platform maximum you
could be talking what is the fastest
memory that is an individual motherboard
manufacturer has validated on their
motherboard to work and in that case I I
would speculate somewhere in the mid
three thousandths range I know you can
get well above 3200 I think you can get
thirty four hundred and thirty I don't
even know what the dividers are above
that but yeah I would guess in that
range fastest memory that's it's
actually like memory overclocked on a
rising platform that that would probably
be from an overclocker somewhere and I'm
yeah I'm also not positive 4133 and yeah
it's it sort of seems like a 4700 list
this kit that we're talking about with
g.skill is probably best suited for an
Intel platform until Rison can prove
otherwise definitely a lot lower women
to rising to moving on though this is
kind of interesting this is an article
from the verge it's been all over the
internet though Intel smart glasses did
you see this
I saw until chat until those making some
smart glasses that look normal
according to the the article is what it
says and they do look normal apart from
the stupid three digit number in the
middle I think that's just a prototype
number or something but imagine if that
wasn't there you would never know that
he was wearing smart glasses they look
kind of just like regular glasses yeah
that kind of fancy techno but they look
a little fancy techno slightly bulkier
on the stems the stems are a little
bulky cuz that's actually where they
house a lot of the all the electronics
but it's actually kind of interesting
the first and foremost the design
language here intel was trying to make
the technology invisible they didn't
want people to know that you were
wearing something other than ordinary
everyday glasses and to get past the the
google goggles stigma yeah exactly
Google glass
for a lot of people I'm having wearables
on your face and admittedly having
wearables on your face is a lot more
particular than like a SmartWatch for
example I'll feel much more comfortable
when i don't know someone's filming
without my without my consent yes
the other cool thing is that like well I
don't know if this is cool or not but
depends who you ask again there's no
camera or anything there's no creepy
camera on these things there's no button
that you have depressed there's no swipe
gesture area no LCD screen it's very
simplistic in fact they don't do
anything beyond improve one's vision
those are the real smart glasses they
were already smart people they didn't
have to try to reinvent the wheel so
what can you do with them so essentially
there is a that I can kind of go to
details human look in my notes um
basically there's a it uses retinal
projection so basically it projects a
small a very low powered extremely low
power like first-class laser class-one
laser which is not damaging according to
Intel to your eyes it projects a laser
into the back of your retina like it
gets way back there which which then you
know if you look and it's positioned in
such a way where you have to look down
you have to look 15 degrees below your
natural line of sight so if you just
kinda like reading glasses in a way
that's what I would attribute okay you
know reading glasses you know you've got
a little like weird reading lenses the
sort of half half Crescent things on the
bottom of your glasses you don't really
ever notice those until you look down
and that's when they appear same thing
here you're not gonna see the laser at
all it will be invisible to you when
you're looking straight ahead we're just
you know going out about your day to day
business but the moment you look
slightly down about 15 degrees which
isn't much is when you'll see this laser
projection on your right retina that's
where it's being projected to and there
you can find information like like
simple stuff like directions or maybe a
recipe detailed personal information of
any person they wouldn't actually be
looking at or if you're on the side
you're on the corner of a street at an
intersection and there's two restaurants
and you want to just quickly look up the
Yelper
use for each one just by simply glancing
down that's the sort of thing that
Intel's going for here which sounds
pretty cool and it's a red monochrome
laser so you'll see it in red but the
fact that it's projecting to the back of
your retinas also means that it's
completely in focus
all the time and then it doesn't matter
if you had it works equally well if you
have prescription or non-prescription
lenses and it's probably the best
response to everything is just Gordon
Gordon wearing them he is an early
adopter that guy and so basically you
have what's what is this this HUD it's a
HUD that helps you in things in life and
other stuff it's like a SmartWatch on
your face that's what they that's the
slogan should be Intel it's called the
vault by the way or vaunt
Intel Vaughn into a lot it's like a
SmartWatch on your face I mean that
would sell right I'm intrigued super and
rate it works a via bluetooth with
either Android or iPhone devices and it
should last a full day in tell us
targeting 18 hours of battery life we'll
see if they hit that mark but yeah I
don't know is this dumb is this stupid
is this direction that we're heading him
completely unnecessary and just a cash
grab and further drinking off our
technological boner or is this something
that we could actually find useful
someday
I think what's very interesting is that
they're going to be opening the opening
this technology up to developers first
so I think Intel themselves probably
won't be the ones who figure out the
best application for their own products
I think it's gonna be the developers who
find this niche market that just you
know really really utilizes these
glasses to their fullest but we don't
exactly know what this is yeah it's
similar to what they've done with some
of their VR and air stuffs that they've
been developing unlike their lidar
little little sense sensors like I can't
pull the name out of my brain right now
but yeah the sets the sensors they make
it's like they're they don't have the
resources to go and
they probably could if they wanted to
but they they're basically trying to
create a vehicle for their technology
for the chips that they're making and
everything like that so yeah yes that's
probably the same thing that they're
going Como's right here yeah definitely
and said it'll be interesting to see
what what they come up with I think that
I was watching the interview with one of
the Intel dudes who works at the you
know special products whatever and he
was saying like you know what the first
time smartphones came around I didn't
immediately think ooh
ride-sharing will have uber in like ten
years
mm-hmm but there it is so like who knows
what developers are gonna figure out you
know who knows what they're gonna be
able to do with this once they start you
know tapping into the potential here so
kind of interesting guys let us know in
check if you would ever wear something
like this assuming that you know didn't
it didn't like cost you any social
points cuz I think that's a huge thing
to I'm writing and waiting until they
can just embed this directly into my
eyes then then we're talking some black
mirror yeah then black mirrors
gonna really step up their game or the
contact lens version of the content yeah
be nice pop that out um hello honey in
chat my wife's in chat she was wondering
why she just came in she was wondering
why you're drinking Pyrrhus I don't know
maybe I asked your husband my subjects
me to send I would say maybe watch the
full episode I like to have to do is
have a nice full refreshing swig of this
delicious Porter but instead of games to
UK hurry up and finish your haps like a
normal person
all right we have about 10 minutes or so
left here um okay Germany here's here's
something Germany okay is a gentleman
this is an article from kick guru first
of all let's talk about EA and like the
shitstorm they're in so they actually
reported significantly less earnings for
their battlefront to launch than they
projected well they're acting like 14
million they only got like nine million
or something like that and they're
trimming it they're a tribute
attributing it to the fact that there
was all this controversy problem
yes exactly gray this is and
you're
you're taking the fun out of gaming and
there and you're making it all about
money for you and your if you guys are
under a rock or something you have no
idea what we're talking about EA is a
huge they have a huge hard-on for micro
transactions and with battlefront 2
before it launched they kind of gave the
statistics or the beta and stuff and let
people know let the users know that
you're gonna have to go for like your
have to games like thousands of apps
hundreds hundreds or thousands of hours
yes of course yeah yeah you're gonna
have to game like longer than anyone
should reasonably game for in this one
game to unlock like Darth Vader which
has like beefed up specs and I'm like
you know he's like a better character to
play with he's funner and he has a
competitive edge and people who have
money are gonna be able to just buy him
on day one if he's 100 bucks no problem
I work you know I'm some CEOs kid and
like I now I'm better than you at this
game because I have money
and all the other bitches have to like
game for like the next 40,000 hours in
order to unlock that so then everyone
made a stink about it and EA was like
okay this is looking really bad
on us so we're gonna cancel
microtransactions for now and they kind
of put the data that was right before
Christmas right before trying to make
sure that they're all aired their
holiday season sales or anything like
that right and the backlash is like it
was the most downloaded comment ever on
reddit and then da made and still become
a meme about them trying to like make
things over by saying like people love
this system because it gives them a
sense of pride and accomplishment in the
bollocky no it's it gives you a
 ton of money and it over all
the gamers so they launched the game
without microtransactions you couldn't
buy loot crate's you couldn't unlock
characters for for cash or the in-game
currency had to be bought through
gameplay experience which in my opinion
is the way it should be all the time
anyway but we're okay with cosmetic
cosmetic is fine cosmetic for Cosmo fine
wear or make your kids literally give
you trillions and fancy yeah and
everyone knows like hey you paid 25
bucks for that hat or whatever sure as
well that's fine yeah as long as there's
no competitive edge and for like money
Blizz
Blizzard does it I feel like it does
sort of a nice sort of split they still
profit from it granted right but they've
done like special pets in Wow and they
partner with the charity and like half
of the money that gets paid for this
special cosmetic pet goes to a charity
or something like that like yeah you
know there's ways of doing it that's
reasonable it's the pay2win model that
that sucks for gamers to be honest
because not everyone has the same amount
of money in their wallets so basically
there and there's a whole other
controversy around loot boxes being paid
for and things like this when it comes
to just encouraging youth to gamble in a
sense spend their money on loot boxes
which you don't know what you're gonna
get inside it could be total or it
could be something awesome but it's kind
of like it basically is gambling in a
way Digital gambling and so the German
Germany is kind of like they have their
sights on this the what is it called
this is an article from kid guru the
German youth protection Commission they
might they're considering banning loot
boxes and games altogether such a German
name for German news protection
Commission really is right on the nose
very aptly named they say that this type
of mechanism in gaming encourages the
chairman's name is Wolfgang among youth
I know could you get any more German
both his last name has has that weird
crate crate crane if only it was
blitzkrieg Wolfgang Brittain Wolfgang
blitzkrieg would have been the most
German name ever great like I want to
say B but I know it's not a being crazy
clearly who knows ss that's a SS kunai
sink that's not an S maybe it is a
German can't give it s like an extra hat
and a tail and then say it's an S no
that's that's how that's the German
alpha very sick oh that's catchy
you know I'm like you're I'm like half
German I really should know wow I'm a
complete failure finish your beer at
that spoon unbelievable so um this is a
serious issue you know people are
getting ridden raged by the same that
doesn't curry
gambling all that stuff and Germany's
not the only one the UK Gambling
Commission is considering this the
Netherlands Belgium and even some US
states including Hawaii and Washington
have genuine concerns about loot boxing
and what its effect is on the young
community so I'm with them I'm with them
just because I hate microtransactions in
general that give people an unfair
advantage in game and allowed them to
win and get more kills because they're
loaded it's but let's move on
you guys let us know and chat you guys
have already been voicing your lead what
have you this is probably not linked in
the description cuz I pull it up just
now but Rolling Stone article from just
a few days ago January 30th I guess was
last week
paint lube boxes are coming back to
battlefront - yes so yeah I mention that
just as predicted when they said like oh
we're gonna now do boxes from there was
like yeah Burbage was very clear that it
was open and we're still gonna do it
we're just gonna try to dissuade people
from hating us at all for the time being
hopefully the dust will settle we still
need that cash and it's interesting -
the way that it works because I feel
like with microtransactions it's
generally like a very small group of
gamers that create the most revenue for
a company cuz I mean it let's say we all
bought battlefield Battlefront - we're
not all gonna be doing those micro
transactions but the few the small
minority who is they're spending like
hundreds of dollars a month
yeah and that's their call they call
them whales yeah it's very common they
go Williams like with a cell phone like
Android and iPhone games and stuff like
that that's like clash of clans most
people are gonna spend any money on it
but the few people who do get addicted
addicted to it yeah a ton of money and
that's why it's very exploitative yes
because gambling because those people
probably needs you know some sort of
counseling or health - you know because
it's an addiction to going and get
repeated ly do something exactly and
that's another good point
you know sometimes you think about like
the people who are who are who are who
unlocked Darth Vader on day one as like
these rich people who have more money
than you a lot of those people probably
don't have more money than you they're
just like going into debt and just debt
or you are not physically your sponsor
if you put it on your credit card so you
can be better in a game than other
people for a week which so many people
do yeah it's it's crazy it's toxic
really it's kind of disgusting
 you a damn ETA everyone responds
Aristo let us know hey one last one last
word on my story um Red Dead Redemption
2 has leaked some information I'm super
excited about this because I was a huge
Red Dead Redemption 1 fan when I was
still a console blip sorry
this is articles from overclocked 3d and
I'll just let you know now that the game
has been delayed till October 2018 and
we still don't know we still have no
confirmation if it's gonna actually
launch for PC if it does it would
probably launch at a later date after
the consoles get it like GTA 5 I don't
know if you've noticed scale but there's
a massive movement in twitch chat right
now - pardon Paul are we partying Paul
okay okay
suffering I will I will pardon you as
soon as this articles over so you have
your free rein of beer when we do the
donations and stuff okay that's kind of
okay we'll cut it off there in the
meantime in the meantime so you will be
able to play as Arthur Morgan I'm kind
of sad that john marston isn't coming
back maybe he is maybe a little cameo at
some point and your choices are affected
or your choices in-game affect the story
the main storyline during the in the
campaign mode which is kind of you know
Mass Effect II and stuff based on the
different dialogue options that you
choose well you know determine what the
overall narrative of the story will be
this is very reminiscent right now of
Westworld
do you watch Westworld no I
I need to talk and you talk the wife
into that ah she's dude you were missing
out you're all missing out it's such a
good show I know and it like maybe it
gets me so pumped maybe maybe if people
like to see maybe if people tweet to
mrs. Paul Hardware everyone tweet to
mrs. rest world if you watch my swing
it's good tell them what it is I'll be
one of those tweeters anything that's
like too dark oh no we watch it's like
sweet darker than any we have to really
ease our way into black mirror like but
still haven't watched all of the first
season you know you know we've watched a
couple of the episodes from the latest
season yeah good been doing some of the
episodes from the the Android Dream
Androids Dream no electric dreams oh
yeah electric dreams yeah Heather you
guys turned us on to that yes good too
but this game is going to be hopefully
great I have high hopes for it and some
missions are playable with different
legal ramifications things like that
with events changing depending on which
NPCs you interact with so forth you have
fast travel locations on a massive map
I'm thinking GTA GTA 5 sighs at the very
least maybe in the form of trains you
might be able to fast travel if you hop
on a train which was not available that
makes sense in part one yeah that's
exactly how I appreciate fast travel
when it's done within the context of the
story University of course it's like hey
here's this magic you know block and
Stephanie some way you can work like to
wherever life takes you out of the whole
immersive umber sous-vide it's the word
side missions challenges kind of a word
you know I like it it's my favorite word
fishing you'll be able to go horseback
riding of course and crafting you can
take on Downey's just like the first one
multiplayer there are three mission
types revealed so far money grab where
players fight over bags of cash in a
central location and the bags which can
be returned to player 2 player bases for
points so true to real life indeed
that's what we all do the only basis
revive and survive isn't
another team mode where teams fight
against each other with a limited number
of revives that makes sense kind of like
a team deathmatch and then battle royale
I thought I thought this is interesting
battle royale they're gonna have a
similar like pub GS gaming mode a lesser
mine a Western pub G I think that'd be
super fun I wonder how I'll start
everyone when is it there's a big
hot-air balloon let go and every float
slowly into there I mean that's it's a
fun game style as pop G has proven so
yeah I'm sure we're gonna see that more
and more with different games what it
does indicate is that if they're willing
to do it if they're gonna do a battle
royale type def match then the map must
be pretty huge that's my that's my
takeaway that's almost like a trade I
like you have to if you go up both ways
if the maps too big then people don't
actually meet and unless you unless you
have that genius mechanism in like pub
gene h1 where like the map is in smaller
yeah so that could be work something
like that men go cool those are the
Articles for today let's talk about some
of your donations
yay money that you've given us I love it
we have our first donation from most
heaviest man five dollars would you want
some of my home brew beer I can send it
to you the guys that Anchor Steam loved
it
sure send it away I have a high opinion
of the guys at Anchor Steam because I
enjoy Anchor Steam beer such as do I
know their beer so if your beer is good
then good enough for them good agree to
send it over do it um Carl my PA box is
do you wanna tell them yes my view box
is in the video description of every
video that I do as is mine and I got my
PA box back after losing it last week so
it's all good that's good
so you can send stuff to Cal again
although we're not doing
mail time this week I'm sorry yeah over
there today but next week perhaps yep
Carl Hall five Canadians here's some
beer money for Paul for being on time
Cheers yeah cheers to that you don't
have to you can take this out now oh
yeah and then we're no worse stupid
spoon I was good I was gonna come up
with more punishments like that I just
thought about one of them boys a drink
yeah it was just gonna be like it was
just gonna be like you drink but then
when you asked me on stream I was like I
have to come up with like oh man what
could what could the punishment be and
you said there you can't think of
anything but next up we've got
Christopher Bristol for the five bucks
no comment thanks Christopher thanks
Chris you're the best moto our sport nej
for the five bucks hey Kyle been mining
as a hobby with 310 ATT is think crypto
videos would be very interesting memory
price biggest issue with GPU supply now
yeah you know I I've been interested in
not just for like views and stuff but I
kind of want a more hands-on knowledge
and experience with mining because it's
still kind of an abstraction to me and I
feel like the only real way to learn
some things is to just kind of do it so
I think it would be like educational to
be honest is probably the number one
reason like you know yeah but we'll see
we'll see what happens in the next few
weeks
James Vaudrey 25 Canadian that's a lot
of Canadians thank you very much sir hey

it
um i don't know what he wants you to he
says would love for you to check out my
pc but oh um tweet at me

check out your PC is to tweet me on hit
my PC day right on tonight many tweets
other than that he pays no attention
pretty much pretty much like the trick
that is really the trick I do not have
time to check my feed constantly I just

computers and trick Diana laughing
at me no probably nothing she's game I
thought I got I got a customer she cares
nothing for about or attack
um wifey sauce all the same motor our
sport nej again $5 analogy reality is
more complicated but simple way to think
a sick Eccles plus minus GP u equals x
divided by CP u equals formula each is a
more complex level of the next you made
that much more complicated probably than
it needs to be cuz you have no idea what
you just said this is a GPU equals and
you make I think that's a syntax error
right there is one coming out with you
you know you made me feel especially
dumb tonight
I understand auto our Sportage a
automatic Matt but another five dollars
Paul HTPC please Matt I have a video K
this week that is ten genitally related
to they come on Ted generally related as
all we get yes after months it's gotta
start somewhere it's got ambitious you
just you just kicked your viewers in the
tan genitals that's they should be ten
genitally thankful at this point I'm
like you know what Paul I do want to see
that video I'm gonna start hopping on
their bandwagon you're slowly getting
outnumbered but so now we've got ten
genitals trending and trapped yo all
right just just just came at five dollar
had to wake up at 5:45 because my water
heater broke today and F my up
slipped on ice
after water froze it's like terrible
morning make my day
well you know what man kmac that sucks
but if your day hasn't already been made
by our beautiful faces for the last hour
it's not gonna get any better than that
it's all downhill from here my friend
kay Mac is the same dude who donated a
12-minute
yeah yeah of course you know I mean he's
he's amazing he's the best it's great
he's my favorite
I'm glad that after you had such a
crappy day you were willing to stick
with it
and donate money donate money to our
livestream hell again I'm impressed
 atomic age a 74 says I'm $5 Kyle
and Paul always entertaining telescope
I think there are times when I'm not
entertaining me too
but me too but you know I try not to do
that while I'm live-streaming true I
don't like to be always entertaining my
I'm in front of hundreds of people
quantum monkey thank you sir thank you
very much quantum Monk $5 hey guys did
you ever think did you ever drink the
beers I sent you tell me when where how
they came with lovely fan art by my
girlfriend I want to see and hear it
thank you
quantum Monk did we ever get please we
got some beers or and prior to the
holidays are right around the holidays
that we drink on the show but I don't
recall no fan art if you said it's a
monk it's possible if you sent it to
Kyle's might have been sent back to you
because I didn't get the renewal notice
I I wasn't checking my PA box as
frequently as I should have
and during that dry spell of me checking
it the peel of the post office put like
a renewal like I had to renew my
post-office subscription and that's miss
money for a PA box you do which I did
not realize I was not on like an
automatic renewal so they closed out my
P o box and they sent everything that
was in there back to everyone to the
original sender so maybe you've got it
or maybe you should be getting it back
soon or I just never got it I don't know
I don't know but my people box is now
open it's in the description of my
youtube videos you can send anything
there now and I will check it I'm sorry
and I'm sorry if we missed it yes I
would I would really like to see the fan
art I like fan art it's fun Caleb Watts
tannin containers
I was wondering if you thought a gtx
1070 TI and an r5 Rison v 1600 x would
pair nicely also is that overkill for
gaming it to to 4k and rendering and
recording and streaming love your work
by the way no it is not overkill at all
and I think that's a fantastic pairing
that's a great option right now yeah
especially if you can buy the graphics
card at retail yeah I mean are the 16
decks I mean you've got you know some
Headroom there you've got yeah assuming
exactly if somebody can get it for a
decent price that GPU you got 6 cores 12
threads it's gonna be great for
rendering it streaming absolutely you're
not gonna be completely capable of this
like the really highest end games that
are the most GPU intensive at 4k but you
said 2 to 4 K so if you're a 2560 by
1440 you're golden
yeah and that's a that's a great great
combo there yeah Nate penny now let's
take some of my Bitcoin profits don't
worry I only use my personal computer to
mine while sleeping and at work don't
blame me for the GPU shortage we will
not that's fine we do not blame you
we don't blame anyone who gives us money
yeah I don't think for any site we blame
you until you'd give this money longer
blames everyone else who's not me who is
confess your sin side with some coin
some Bitcoin Marc corn five dollars
could you guys do reviews on lower price
racing chairs like on Amazon compare
them to dxracer and verdict you don't
want to spend two hundred fifty nine
dollars plus on a chair yeah I mean you
know what honestly it's like now oh yeah
I've never explored low price racing
chairs on Amazon I feel like the low
price racing chairs like you you you
really do get what you pay for the lower
price racing chairs they cut there they
cut corners in ways that make the chair
either less durable or less comfortable
cuz I've sat in some like more
economical reputation cherry picker and
they're not the same it's it's weird but
it's like because it's there's just such
a there's so few options out there when
it comes to racing chairs that allows
them to drive the prices up and there
are so many copycats
started trying to tap into that market
that that might look the same from the
outside and it's one of those things
where because there aren't performance
numbers because it's not like something
like an SSD or something that you could
just test and put on a test a test bed
you don't really know how that product
is going to be or perform until you
actually sit in it and so I feel like
there's a lot of opportunity for deceit
or you know in some ways for a lot of
these more budget end gaming chairs so
that's all I have to say about that but
thank you my squeezing arm $20 donation
says love you guys thank you for the
content I have a job interview Friday
wish me luck good luck my squeezing arm
also which certifications would he get I
already have a plus I don't have any
certifications yeah you're fine are you
in college in high school hey Plus is
all you mean that's really the top like
that's the best grade you can get so I
wouldn't where can you go from there a
plus plus extra credit plus plus wait a
B it's good luck with the job interview
Christopher Pinto this is my intern and
good friend and and and buddy buddy old
pal what's up Chris why are you giving
us money that's not it we don't even pay
you anything for that internship you're
losing more money now yeah but thank you
alright very disappointed in your
business acumen yeah why don't I even
hire you in the first place he asked
what's better Coke or Pepsi who's better
Paul or Kyle neither Coke Pepsi if you
have to drink sugar water go with dr.
pepper and really yeah but I mean what
if you what if there was what if dr.
pepper didn't exist what if you only had
Coke or Pepsi I wouldn't drink either
wanna drink water
no but there's no water either in this
in this fictional land you have Coke or
Pepsi try to imagine the hypothetical
scenario here Paul which one do you
reach for and probably Coke I guess and
why they've spent more money globally on
advertising Wow Wow that is that's the
worst
the polar bears versus the polar bears
so uh victory landslide for co-pays on
the polar bear front okay sure I also
say coke but just because it tastes
better
I feel like Pepsi is too syrupy and
sweet and coke has a more carbonated
refreshing finish both therapy and sweet
okay okay but coke but coke is not like
Pepsi's like Pepsi's like second grade
Cola Pepsi's like Shasta I think is like
a refined like 90% of these to have
cocaine in 90% of the time I would very
much rather drink water than either Coke
or Pepsi I'm not arguing against coke
versus water I know I'm saying in this
hi you're on an island and there's only
a Coke or Pepsi and you say even the TV
with you that even looks suck even the
gating like the the negative impact of
the sugar or whatever you're on me like
I have just a flavor like edge with like
water like I like the taste of water
okay I agree dr. whoever beats both
number dark forever is awesome yeah
Chris thank you for your donation you
