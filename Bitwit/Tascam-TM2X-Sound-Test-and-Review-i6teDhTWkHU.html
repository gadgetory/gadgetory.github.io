channel today I'm going to be taking a
look at this TM 2x condenser microphone
from tascam now this isn't a sample or a
review sample from tascam themselves
this was kind of more of an impulse buy
on my end I actually bought it off a
mass drop a few days ago from sorry a
few weeks ago for like 50 something
dollars it's usually 60 something
dollars so I got a decent deal on it but
like I said it was kind of bought on a
whim because I don't really have
anything like this in my current film
equipment arsenal and this is by no
means a high-end product right it's 50
bucks you can pretty much pick one up
with with relative ease the built-in
microphones on almost every single
camera DSLR point-and-shoot they just
they're quite frankly they're crap so
this is just a great simple cheap way to
kind of boost your audio quality with
whatever camera you might be using does
connect to your camera via a shoe
accessory mount so make sure that your
camera does have one of those before
picking one of these up but I'm going to
talk about all that good fun stuff in
just a bit so why don't we take this out
of the box and see what's inside
alright so let's take a look at this
little microphone right here as you can
see it's pretty small it does look
really nice too looks very professional
you get some tascam branding on the back
there at the tm-2 X model number
very classy stuff this is the microphone
right here or the microphones I should
say because there are two of them so you
do get stereo sound it does feature an
XY cardioid pattern pickup so got to
familiar with that cardioid means that
it's going to be picking up sound in the
direction of the microphone spacing for
the most part it's not as directional as
a hyper-cardioid or shotgun pattern but
it is much more directional than let's
say an omnidirectional microphone which
obviously picks up sound coming from all
directions of the microphone so because
of that they do allow you to swivel the
microphone up and down 180 degrees and
anywhere in between so you can point the
microphone directly at your audio source
just for a better pick up and the XY
pattern thing all that means is that
this microphone is picking up sound from
this way
and this microphone is picking up sound
from this way and together you kind of
get this cone of pickup area so this is
actually a really good solution for
something like pollen eyes live stream
that we do every week where you have two
audio sources
coming from each of the hosts sitting
side-by-side and having this kind of
pickup pattern will really help you pick
up both both audio sources and both
voices quite evenly with relative ease
so it's kind of nice to have I might
actually try this out for one of the
live streams in the future on the left
side of the mic you get a low-cut filter
right here this is really great for
eliminating low frequencies that are
generally unwanted when you're recording
so for example the room Rumble or that
ambient room noise that you sometimes
hear and really bad YouTube videos or
even some of mine probably this is
really great for eliminating that you
just kind of enable it and it'll cut off
any low frequencies that are below 130
kilohertz I believe that's correct and
this is going to be great because it
doesn't interfere with the human voice
the human voice actually operates at a
much higher frequency than that so you
can actually eliminate room Rumble
without without alternating someone's
voice which is a nice feature to have on
the other side you get a low and high
sensitivity switch which is really handy
for picking up noise in a really loud or
quiet environment so if you happen to be
at a concert and your audio levels are
just peaking left and right you can
switch it to low sensitivity and that
that will give you a much more even pick
up without peaking so much or if you're
let's say I can't around a campfire and
someone's telling ghost stories really
quietly you can switch it to high
sensitivity if you really want to be
able to hear what they're saying and
pick them up a bit better
apart from that you'll notice how this
microphone is kind of floating it's kind
of suspended in midair magically the
reason for this is basically noise
isolation and vibration isolation so any
kind of vibration that might be coming
from your camera that might be moving up
towards the mic will just stop it'll
it'll come to a dead stop at the
suspension mechanism here so that you
don't pick it up on your microphone and
get you know really bad Rumble noise or
any kind of vibration things like that
really nice to have you also do get some
cable clasps here you can see there's
two of them behind the microphone and
two of them in front for type II cable
management of this this cable here I'm
going to get to that later let's talk
about the K we're really quick you get a
13 inch 8 inch cable plugs right into
your DSLR or whatever camera you're
using this is great for just plug in
power essentially you don't have to have
any kind of battery there's no battery
that you need to charge or replace in
this thing it just simply gets powered
by your camera by the batter
your camera so you do want to make sure
you have extra batteries on hand for
your camera because you'll be sipping on
it a little bit with the TM 2x but all
in all very nice plug-and-play feature
on the bottom here you do get a quarter
inch thread so you can mount this
microphone onto a tripod for example
honestly it might look a little funny on
a tripod because it's so small but I'm
sure that there are use case scenarios
where that would make a lot of sense
so it's good to have that feature as
well but the main the main squeeze here
is that this is a shoe accessory mount
so you can slide this onto your your hot
shoe on your on your camera and then
tighten it down with this little screw
here the one problem I have with this
mechanism is that this is completely
plastic the thread is the thread is also
plastic but and that's okay but the
actual screw and the thread underneath
it is completely plastic and I would
have liked to see a metal construction
especially since this is going to be
getting handled all the time taking it
off and putting it on to the camera and
actually truth be told this is not the
original microphone that I got from mass
drop this is actually in exchange I had
to replace mine because it came
completely defected on arrival where
this entire piece all the way up to the
thread had completely snapped off of the
microphone and there was just no way
fixing it so I would like to see that in
a future revision test can be if you're
listening make this metal it make me
happy but apart from that I think that
pretty much wraps it up for the
microphone so let's move on to our first
accessory alright so here we have the
noise isolation arm and what this
essentially does is it puts your your
microphone further away from your DSLR
and closer to your subject so if your
subjects a bit further away and you're
having a hard time picking them up you
might want to consider using this noise
isolation arm you kind of just screw it
on like that it has a hot shoe right at
the front screws down just like that and
then you would screw this part to your
DSLR which is also a hot shoe accessory
right here also made of plastic tascam
again make this metal especially this
especially the noise isolation arm right
because there's a lot more support and a
lot more weight kind of pressing on it
and putting tension on it so would like
to see metal on that as well but the
other benefit of having this long arm
besides being able to get closer to your
subject is putting the microphone
further away from your camera so
especially on DSLRs where you have your
shutter the shutter
your lens opening and closing and making
noise or even just the buttons if you're
just pressing buttons and changing
settings on the fly while you're filming
on your DSLR a lot of that mechanical
noise can get picked up quite easily by
the microphone but having this isolation
arm just puts it a little bit further
away from the that audio source so that
it's not picking up any unwanted
mechanical noise which is nice to see
and finally oh wait I did want to
mention that you should not use this as
a handle I think this goes without
saying but you know test cam really
wanted to make it clear even for the
stupid people who can't read they've
included a picture to show you how not
to use it obviously it's not doesn't
have the most structure
structural integrity so I would
definitely not use this to pick up your
camera by any means lastly for this
accessory I did want to show you the
cable routing magic here using these
little cable routing clips these clasps
I don't know exactly if they're clips or
clasps or whatever but there's also one
on the isolation arm right here so you
can tie it like that and it just kind of
makes your cable a lot more tidy overall
looks it looks more professional and it
also just keeps it out of the way so it
doesn't accidentally get snagged on
anything and cause some problems or even
damage so nice feature to have there as
well
and lastly we do have a little included
dead cat this is also really handy
especially if you're going outdoors and
you're filming outside you simply slide
this over your microphone like so and it
helps eliminate wind noise definitely
reduces wind noise quite quite nicely so
it looks very nice too it's a nice
looking dead cat I never thought I'd say
that about a dead cat but it does look
pretty professional overall and it is a
nice accessory to have so there you go I
think on that note we should do some
audio testing I think we've seen enough
here to kind of know what we're dealing
with so I'm going to do a little audio
test between the TM 2x my dr-40 from
tascam which is my daily recorder that I
use for all my YouTube videos which is a
$200 PCM recorder so it's probably gonna
sound a bit nicer than this thing but
just to have you something to compare it
to and lastly I'm also going to compare
both of those microphones to the shitty
built-in mic that's on the DSLR which is
what I'm filming with right now so why
don't we go ahead and have a listen
alright
whoa Manby noise out there we're
recording right now with all three
microphones but I'm going to switch
between the three of them in
post-production so right now you're
hearing the built-in microphone on my
Canon 70d we're still in my room same
room I'm equidistant from all three
microphones more or less within an inch
or two so that's not going to make too
much of a difference but here's the
built-in microphone sound and I'm going
to switch it over to the tascam really
quick give me a second so I just I just
plugged in the eighth inch Jack of the
test cam 2 m TX 2 TM 2x hopefully this
sounds a bit better I'm coming through a
bit clearer now blah blah blah blah blah
I'm going to go ahead and switch the
low-cut filter on as you can see if that
sounds me different I haven't really
heard it yet but maybe there's less room
Rumble or something like that som some
lowered stifled ambient noises in my
room I don't have the AC on or anything
so it shouldn't be too bad but there you
guys have it so there's the TM 2x and
then finally we're going to switch over
to the to the dr-40 task cam that I use
daily for all my YouTube videos and
stuff it's what you were hearing earlier
when I was actually taking a look at the
microphone up close and stuff so this
should probably sound the best out of
all three but there you go alright and
there you guys have the sound test in my
opinion I think the TM 2x does a pretty
good job of picking up my voice and
making it sound relatively natural and
clear obviously when comparing it to
something like the dr-40 which is a $200
PCM recorder I mean this obviously it's
a 50 $60 mic so it's kind of unfair to
compare the two but I think it did a
pretty good job in its own right for
being such a budget a budget microphone
and I think where this this kind of
thing really shines is in field shooting
so if you're going to go off site
somewhere and maybe you're just doing
some point-and-shoot type material I
think it could be a lot more cumbersome
to actually have like a wireless pack on
your subject you know with a lavalier
and stuff just slap this onto your DSLR
and just plug it in and start shooting I
think this also really helps a lot in
post-production too because being able
to plug in the 8th inch Jack into your
DSLR directly allows you to record both
audio and video simultaneously so when
you're in post-production you don't have
to actually sync the audio and video
track separately it's all recorded there
on one file so
let's definitely provide some expedited
usage for people like me but altogether
for 50 60 bucks especially if you can
get a good deal on this thing on a site
like mass drop like I did you really
can't go wrong and I really do love how
does have a lot of good features that it
comes with some good accessories like
the noise isolation arm and the dead cat
but that is just my opinion let me know
what you guys think of this microphone

interested in something like this for
all of you film aficionados out there
