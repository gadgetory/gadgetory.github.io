channel I wanted to take some time today
to make a fairly big announcement and
explain what's been going on with me the
channel my future of life those of you
subscribe to Paul from Paul's hardware
have probably already seen his recent
announcement where he explains
everything that's been going on with him
lately while also alluding to the idea
that I may be in the same boat which is
partially true so let's get down to it
first off I'm no longer a full-time
employee at newegg.com
but it is possible that I may continue
working there as an independent
contractor going in once a week to shoot
videos for their Newegg TV YouTube
channel this is great news for me
because I really love everyone on the
Newegg TV team they become like my
second family and being able to continue
working with them even if it's just for
once a week is pretty awesome now my
main reason for taking a step back from
Newegg relates to more personal matters
my wonderful loving grandparents who
practically raised me from day one
recently began needing more help with
day-to-day tasks you see what I did the
like getting groceries making trips to
the doctor's office all those fun things
we look forward to an old age so I
assess my situation and made a decision
last month I put in my two weeks at the
egg pack my life into boxes mostly new
egg boxes and moved into my grandparents
place to make myself more available to
them to provide any assistance they
might need I know I can't even take care
of myself
they're totally screwed now as you might
have guessed this new change means I'll
have a lot more time at home so I'm
excited to announce that I'll be using
most of that time to grow and cultivate
this channel this is going to allow me
to not only increase the overall quality
of my content but to post videos much
more frequently as well so if you're not
already subscribed now's a good time if
not the best time to be a part of the
network and as exciting as this may be
my situation does bring about some new
challenges most prominently is that I no
longer have a source of stable income
and in some ways I'm already starting to
feel the effects
so I'm reaching out to you guys for
support during this transition if you
haven't done so already you can bookmark
my Amazon affiliate link in the
description below and use it every time
you buy stuff this helps me out
tremendously but I know many of you also
follow Linus from Linus tech tips and
are already using his affiliate links so
I'm not gonna ask you guys to replace
his link with mine because that's
beneath me Who am I kidding go for it in
all seriousness Linus is a good pal of
mine so feel free to bookmark my link if
you don't already use his the second way
you can help support me comes as another
big announcement I'm selling shirts
cyllid shirts the awesomesauce Network
store just went live today so check out
the link in the description and pick up
one of my custom-made torso chassis they
offer great airflow keep your internals
clean and prevent dust buildup on your
nipples nothing I hate more than dusty
nipples so with all of that out of the
way the only thing I have left to say is
thank you for everything I know I
wouldn't stand a chance of making this
channel work in the first place if it
wasn't for each and every one of you
guys so from the bottom of my heart
thank you now moving things right along
I'm gonna switch gears here because I
thought this video was also the perfect
opportunity to give you guys a little
tour of my new home and where I'll be
shooting videos from now on plus I just
moved in so everything's still clean so
come on follow me alright so I'm
standing at the front door entrance of
my grandparents place right now and this
is the first living room that you will
encounter upon walking into the house
every family or a lot of families have
that one living room that no one
actually really lives in it's just full
of a bunch of old antique crap and this
would be that room so we've got some
really old school couches I don't even
know what kind of material this is made
out of but it looks like it's taken
straight from kangas khan's castle or
something like that you'll notice that a
lot of these plates are face down so
that my my silly cats don't accidentally
knock them over and break some precious
family heirloom there's the cat food not
exactly an antique but moving on here we
are in the kitchens is where I do all of
my eating and drinking as well as food
storage and things like that
it's a very nice kitchen I do a little
bit of cooking here every now and then
as well there's a sink I wash dishes and
then I put them in the dish rack because
I'm an adult dining table this is also
where I decide to eat sometimes most of
the time I just have a quick bite to eat
and I'll eat right there I'll just stamp
the counter like a weirdo and just eat
my meal but sometimes I'll actually take
the time to
down and enjoy my meal and take my time
with it and this is a living room and
this is my grandpa say hi grandpa he's a
very nice nice man so that's pretty much
the living room this is the downstairs
area and other than eating and hanging
out with my grandparents I don't spend
too much time down here and we're going
to go with this this heavenly a
staircase right here I'm going to turn
them the ISO because it just it just
looks like I've died and gone to heaven
that's my grandparents room obviously I
don't go in there much laundry room it's
always nice to have and over here we've
got some stiff this is the the bathroom
is where I do my business you know what
I mean pretty nice bathroom everything
looks pretty brand-new this is a fairly
new home in a nice gated community but
it's a nice bathroom it's got two sinks
and my girlfriend bought a plant for it
and the plant looks really nice I like
the plant this is my bedroom it's a
pretty standard bedroom it does the job
it gets everything done it's a bed I
sleep here and here is the loft slash
living area of the second storey this is
kind of where I spend a lot of my time
mostly for leisure as my beautiful
girlfriend Heather say hi babe that was
that was eloquent she's just on my HTPC
the one that I did a build live on this
channel if you guys are familiar with it
little guy right down there and they're
the kiddies you guys are familiar with
them here's the boy they're both
sleeping it's sleep time
oh so spoiled just spoiled boy last but
not least is the studio room or the
office as I'm calling it and this is my
main desk where I do all my work pretty
much all my editing is done here this is
the haswell-e build that I put together
in a couple videos ago for the haswell-e
launch and it's still working like a
champ
i over clocked it successfully the 40
400 megahertz at one point three to five
bolts and everything is working pretty
smoothly so here's my second computer
this is the old trusty ice ice baby
system that I've had since 2011 and this
is basically the one that I was using
primarily up until recently when
haswell-e
took over so it's just it up for now
eventually I'm going to do something
with it I don't know what I should do
with it yet I'm thinking about tearing
it down
and putting it into a smaller form
factor PC but I don't know exactly what
that PC is going to do for me so if you
guys have any ideas on what I should do
with this system let me know in the
comments below what you think about that
this is where all my camera equipment
stuff usually lives when I'm not using
it my teleprompter my studio lights I've
got my tripod and my slider all here
sitting pretty as well plus the AC that
I got I just bought this off of Amazon
it was like 150 bucks but it's a 5000
BTU little portable AC that just works
like a charm this room isn't terribly
big so it does a great job of filling it
up with a relatively cool air and it's
it's quite powerful as well so I'm very
happy whether the only thing is that it
didn't fit a hundred percent snug in the
window so as you can see I kind of went
OCD and taped up every little hole that
I could find last thing I wanted to
mention about this room is this wall
right here this is the green screen area
and this is where I'm going to be
shooting all of my new show so the
awesomesauce news show or the series is
going to be shot here because I use a
green screen for my my fake studio in
the background so this is this is a
really great solution aside from that
I've got some some products here that
are waiting to be shot and that's my
friends I think sums up this house tour
slash personal vlog update thank you all
so much for watching I hope you guys
enjoyed it and please leave your
comments in the section below let me
know what you think of all these
different changes in this huge
transition that I'm going through and
once again thank you so much for all of
your support you guys have been amazing
over the years and I know you guys will
continue to be so so thank you all
