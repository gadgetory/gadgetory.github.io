moved into the new house for about a
month now I want to say just crazy and I
think the original house tour that I
showed you guys was even before that it
might have been six seven weeks ago and
since then I've been giving you guys
updates and our vlogs documenting the
sort of progress on the house but now
that we're really settled in I wanted to
give you guys sort of a house tour 2.0
to show you guys what the current status
is of bit with HQ so that's what we're
doing today very simple let's go ahead
and start in the living room so this is
the the main living room this is what
we're calling the living room it's sort
of at the back of the house it's the
largest room in the house by far and you
can see it's still kind of in shambles
if you guys recall from the original
house tour this is getting renovated you
remember this is the one with the really
low ceiling it's got tons of water
damage because it wasn't built properly
like this is only like three or four
inches above my head it's really bad so
we're still planning to rip all this out
and just continue this ceiling line all
the way through to that wall and some of
you guys are gonna hate us for this but
we're also gonna drywall up all the
woods so you don't see the wood it's
just gonna be clean white walls still
keeping the pitch ceiling but the reason
why we're drywalling is so we can put
wiring behind it for like recessed
lighting maybe integrated speakers and
maybe even some ventilation because
right now there's no cooling or heat in
this room because it's all an add-on if
you remember and without any vents in
this part of the house it's gonna get
really hot in this room in the summer
it'll be painful so it's kind of a
ticking time bomb
however the contractor that we're going
with who's actually a family friend who
does great work isn't available till
July so we might have to suffer through
it anyway but it's it's gonna be worth
it if you know it's a contractor we
trust and he's got a good deal and stuff
like that now the one caveat is that
we're still gonna have sort of a lower
ceiling but just in the middle just like
there will be a support beam because you
can see here I actually opened up a
piece of drywall so I could take a
closer look you guys can't really see
well from here but there's actually a
beam a pretty tall beam that's right
here and it goes across from wall to
wall now there's obviously you're
certain requirements for how large your
beam has to be based on how much weight
is trying to support but you can sort of
work with the dimensions there so
instead of having a really tall and
skinny beam you could have a really wide
short beam so if we did it that way we'd
be able to elevate the beam quite a bit
higher and give us additional Headroom
so it's a bit more comfortable now as
far as the layout of the room goes wifey
sauce and I both agree that this room is
just too big to have only a couch and TV
like it's just gonna look ridiculous
so we have to fill it up with more stuff
which is why we've decided instead of
having the main
dining table in well the dining room
which is right there the dining area
we're gonna have a smaller like round
circle table there with maybe like four
chairs just kind of like casual and then
the main dining table which is gonna be
like sort of a longer rectangular table
is gonna be right here with like eight
chairs that'll sort of break up this
large room into two halves
we're also debating on which wall the TV
should go on should the TV go on this
wall or that wall this is facing north
right here I'm actually team North and
right now wifey sauce is kind of leaning
team south and I'll give you our
rationale right here so I'm standing in
the dining room right now right there's
a kitchen there's a living room when you
walk in your natural inclination is to
sort of look to the right because that's
where most of the stuff is it kind of
just has a natural flow to go this way
but why he thinks the TV might be better
here because if the couch is further
back towards this way you're not as
distracted by what might be going on in
the dining room over there or in the
family room at the front she kind of
feel like the energy is better when
you're sitting in this corner of the
room I kind of agree with her only for
the fact that whoever sitting at the
dining table can also watch TV it's a
bit more inclusive in that sense and I
get that but ultimately I think I think
the TV might be better over there I
don't know what do you guys think so
that's what's going on with the living
room we basically don't spend any time
in here because we're just waiting for
July to get it to where we want it to be
right now it's just again for storage
and it's it's kind of a kind of a
nightmare more on that later we've got
the dining room right here completely
empty also not being used we don't have
any guests right now because we have
nowhere to sit them kitchen is looking
good pretty much up to speed for now we
still need to get some appliances in
here like washer and dryer which would
go at the back there that's sort of the
hookups are those are coming soon though
they're gonna be pretty swanky as well
so I'm not actually do a video on them
stay tuned for that but longer we live
here the more we love this kitchen
because it's the center of the house you
can kind of just see all around you it's
a very nice spot to be and we love the
sort of c-shaped layout so that when
you're in the middle of it you kind of
are equidistant from all the things you
need to reach it's like a cool little
command center the backyard is pretty
much unchanged we're gonna wait to fix
up the inside of the house a little bit
more before we worry about the back
moving on to the hallway okay let's
let's go down here so we've got the
guest bathroom if you guys remember
which is still a wreck well if your
bottle is there any beer in there no I
don't think so so we're just now
starting to make plans for renovating
the bath
we're gonna do it a piece at a time
though right now we're just gonna do the
the tile for the bathtub it's gonna go
all the way up to the ceiling we have
the title picked out and everything we
actually still have to order it this
week and then we're gonna have the same
contractor who's doing our living room
do this and since the bathrooms a much
smaller project in the living room he'll
be able to push that up a lot sooner you
might actually get this done in the next
month or two
we're probably also gonna get a new
window because this one's really old and
it just makes sense that if we're gonna
change all the tile here we might as
well do the window at the same time so
it doesn't look like a room from one of
the Saw movies we did paint in here so
all this is fresh paint but the tile is
original it's not our favorite in terms
of style but it's perfectly good tile
we're gonna keep it in here for a while
before we start looking at options
shooting room you guys are probably most
familiar with this room because it's in
almost all the videos the set is looking
pretty good it's it's practically done I
did add that bottom layer of acoustic
foam mostly for aesthetics not really
effective because I'm facing this way
you can see I had some leftover panels
that I just put right there actually
need to fill this up more maybe go all
the way around the window or something
like that it might not look the best but
it's really just for sound dampening in
here because there is still quite a bit
of echo and this wall is probably the
most important to actually sound edits
directly across from where my voice is
traveling over although I'm really
loving working here it's it's nice to be
working from home again it's just super
convenient and everything's in one place
well let's move on to the office office
office office so you guys probably
already saw this more recently in a vlog
as well when we built these very fine
cabinets so our workstations are doing
just fine although I am replacing mine
as you guys probably saw in a very
recent video but this little corner here
is the test bench area that's we're
going to be doing most by benchmarking
I'm planning to install maybe a couple
shelves for additional tools and
hardware and things like that so it's
not the biggest desk in the world but
certainly large enough for like a single
test bench here we also have our router
and modem which reminds me I'm probably
gonna be doing sort of like an internet
video like trying to run Ethernet
throughout the house which is I don't
know i have no idea i haven't poked my
head really up in the attic yet so i'm
not exactly sure what i'm gonna find up
there or how far i'll be able to get but
right now the Wi-Fi here is a little
spotty because we have a larger house
and our router is currently wedged into
the deepest corner of the home so i
actually might be doing the Wi-Fi
upgrade video as well where i swap this
router out for like a
I'm networked and just see how that
works in the home that's pretty much all
that's going on here oh the other thing
is that there's a lot of empty space
right here don't mind that weird wagon
that wife Esau's bought but we might
actually put like a couch or futon here
that pulls out to a bed so that if we
have family members or friends who want
to crash here for the night or for the
weekend we can kind of turn this into
sort of like a makeshift guest room and
there's a bonus if guests are sitting on
the couch they can you know watch
Netflix or whatever on on whyphy Sasa
system hopefully not browse too many of
our files they create a guest log in all
right and then finally our bedroom this
is the last room in the house hi wifey
why it looks fine it looks good in here
the cats are in here why did they get
elevated privileges that I don't have
the camera oh yeah she's voters you joke
you poke Wow but yeah the bedroom just
needs a little TLC like the the closets
are still we're still using these racks
just temporarily eventually want to save
up for like a nice custom cabinet but
that's way down the line this will do
for now we also need some new furniture
like maybe a cabinet that's at least as
wide as the TV it looks kind of funny
right now I'm eventually gonna wall
mount the TV as well once we get that
piece of furniture and that'll be a
whole dedicated video on a little mini
entertainment center for the bedroom as
far as the bathroom goes it's still
super tiny oh yeah this is the tiniest
cutest master bath ever got a new shower
curtain from Target to have a new plant
actually the plant was originally in the
kitchen the cats kept eating it and
throwing up because of eating it so now
it's on the toilets freshly painted all
the cabinets in the walls are super
super nice but the tile on the counter
and the floor is still original we're
gonna fix that up way down the line
because master bath only wifey and I
have to endure it so um that's pretty
much it for the new house oh oh the
garage in the original house tour the
garage was just an empty box but now
it's filled with a bunch of crap most of
its trash but that's also where we keep
most of our tech goodies which I think
you guys will appreciate so let's check
out so this is the left half of the
garage which definitely needs to be
dealt with at some points but just
looking at it right now here's being
anxiety so let's look this way this is
much more pleasant here we've got the
vast majority of our products just
chillin and we have our trusty doom guy
watching over all the hardware know we
also have like security systems all
throughout the house in and out and
stuff too but yeah we actually have some
we actually
some space because after the move I
cleared out all of the empty boxes we
have these two large boxes of other
boxes of just all kinds of hardware that
were just taking up tons of space so
it's much more organized now and we have
a bit more breathing room for new
products coming in the other huge
advantage now of having it in here as
opposed to up against the wall like it
was at our last place is that we have
two sides we have easy access to
products on both sides so for example
I've got like you know all the Intel
motherboards on this side AMD on the
other side say what the GP is we've
gotten video over here and AMD's on the
other side AMD you're looking a little
with a little slim over there some tough
times for your graphics team right now I
know I've got our solid-state stash and
tons of memory so we never forget the
CPU shelf is the one I think could use
the most improvement it's just a little
disorganized still I don't really have a
great way to store all these other than
their little clam shells and these fun
engineering sample boxes if you guys are
wondering what PC component takes up the
most space for storage besides a case
it's a iOS AO boxes are just getting
bigger and bigger especially with the
growing popularity of 360 rads well we
have an H 115 I in the Box I know he had
a spare one mmm nice I will have my way
with you later so and of course cases
the bane of my existence we actually got
rid of a ton of cases before the big
move I think we gave away like 25 cases
to two random fans it was awesome so
thank you guys for helping take those
off our hands these are the few that
were left with there's also probably a
few in the house we don't have a ton
more room for new cases coming in so we
have to be very selective with which
cases we decide to review and things
like that if you guys recall all the
shelving was already here before we got
the keys to the house so it's actually
come in handy as you can see so yeah
that's what's good up in the hood y'all
and wifey's Lawson I couldn't be happier
we're really happy with the direction
and the house has been headed and the
sort of renovations that we've been
making but you know there's still a long
way to go this is gonna be a multi-year
project because we're not trying to flip
this house this is our ideally our
forever home and so we're we're
definitely gonna try to take our time
with it but you guys feel free to let us
know what your thoughts are so far and
feel free to toss a like on this video
if you enjoyed it guys thank you so much
for watching get subscribe for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon and I
will see you guys in the next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
