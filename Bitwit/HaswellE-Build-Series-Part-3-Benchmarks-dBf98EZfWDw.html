haswell-e build series now this is part
three where I go over the benchmarks of
the haswell-e build that i just built in
part two you can go ahead and check that
out so the time-lapse build if you
haven't seen that already in part one
goes over all the components that I use
for the system so go ahead and check
those out and then go ahead and come
back to this one or if you've already
watched those two because you're awesome
fans then you're at the right place so
basically I'm going to compare those two
systems my old 2,600 cases tomb that's
running z68
as a correction I accidentally called it
Z 97 in the part 1 but I'm going to be
comparing that old system that's maybe 3
or 4 years old now to my brand new
haswell-e
editing rig so we're gonna stack up
these two systems against each other and
just see how they perform now all the
tests are running at 1920 by 1080 and
I'm using all the latest drivers
everything's up to date so I think we're
pretty good to go and there's there's a
look at the haswell-e bit build right
there looking all pretty in the definer
for and I think that's it so even though
I kind of vaguely described each of the
systems we're still going to go into
detail about the hardware that each of
them are using so let's check that out
now all right so here are the contenders
in the left corner we have the core i7
2600
is the core i7 59 60 X so there you guys
have it those are all the specs of each
systems and honestly this is gonna be a
slaughter
I'll let you guys know and you could
probably assume that just given given
the hardware on both sides but I do want
to give some credit to my old system
it's done very well in the last three
years I've had it I've only had one blue
screen since I've ever had it and that
was recently that was like a couple
weeks ago but other than that it's been
flawless and I absolutely love that
system and I'll still be using it pretty
much on the daily for other for other
tasks so here we go
there's just kind of an a/b comparison
you can see I've got z68 versus the new
x99 platform using that chipset and
we've got same same actually same
capacity of memory although the system
number 2 definitely has a faster clock
speed and we're running ddr4 of course
video cards it's also gonna be kind of a
kind of a slaughter no comparison
there's the GTX 670 versus a 780ti both
Asus cards though by the way great brand
and of course cooling is going to be
marginally improved by that H 100 I and
there you go there's the those rest of
the specs that you can read him running
Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on system one
and Windows 8.1 pro on on system system
two and once again all these tests are
run its stock clock frequency they're
all run at 1920 by 1080 and there you go
let's move on to the benchmarks so first
one Cinebench r15 of course we've got an
absolute catastrophic win for the 59 60
X going from 618 on the 2600 k2 over 13
just over 1300 on the on the new
platform and you can also note the
maximum CPU temps are in red next to the
designated names of the CPUs so 61
degrees Celsius versus 50 on on the new
system it's just this is this is pretty
much expected but there you guys have it
on Adobe Premiere Pro cs6 now this is
kind of an anomaly and I'm still kind of
baffled at these results because I'm I
was expecting the 59 30 K to perform a
lot better than the 2600 K now keep in
mind lower is better here so it's still
beat out the 2600 K but by a very
marginal amount and I was expecting at
least like at least like a 60% increase
in performance here and that is measured
in second so it took 14 31 seconds for
the 2600 K and excuse me 417 seconds for
the 59 30 K but yeah it just doesn't add
up so I'm thinking something's wrong
here if you guys have any ideas let me
know and by the way I've enabled GPU
optimization mercury playback engine for
Adobe Premiere Pro for both systems I
mean it's completely in the work and
it's working properly
and still I'm still seeing very marginal
results here so if you guys have any
idea on what I can do to maybe get the
results I'm expecting let me know in the
comments because I'd really love to know
so you with After Effects I mean After
Effects a little bit better performance
here than the 2600 K but still not
exactly the
um I guess the render time is that I was
expecting so it's a little odd but
honestly if you guys can figure it out
and let me know in the comments I will
troubleshoot the system and make those
changes and see if it runs on you faster
than what it currently stands at and if
it does I'll I'll do another video on it
and we can do a round two with these
benchmarks specifically for the Adobe
Creative Suite
so here's 3dmark fire strike extreme all
the other benchmarks seem to be
performing up to par and as expected
especially in the physics core I mean
keep in mind physics core is taxing the
CPU a lot more than the GPU for example
so obviously we've got 9000 to almost
16,000 which is amazing it's a huge
performance boost and lastly I thought I
would throw a video I'm sorry a 3d
render test in there just just to show
off that GTX 780 Ti that's oh so
glamorous I had to have one gaming
benchmark in there so here we have Metro
last light and obviously you can just
kind of see it's a testament to the 780
Ti the matrix from Asus is just it's
just dominating in this of course so 129
average I'm sorry
47 average FPS 285 that's that's nearly
double guys so I guess that's once again
pretty expected but it's also nice to
see alright guys so there you have the
benchmarks and let me know what you guys
think in the comments below of these
results and I think that concludes this
haswell-e build series so thank you all
very much for being a part of it please
let me know what you guys think of this
series in the comments as well and toss
me a like and please favorite the video
it helps me a lot on the search rankings
and helps me get seen so I get more
supports and hopefully create better
content for you guys and also I
apologize for part 3 coming out a little
bit later than the first two videos in
the series as you can tell I've kind of
relocated to a new a new place I'm no
longer living where I was I had a huge
move this last week so things look a
little different I have a lot more space
though which is awesome so possibly stay
tuned for a room tour or a new a new
studio tour in the future thank you guys
so much for watching them can with
awesome sauce Network I'll see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
