let's go mono animals this is gonna be
sort of a studio blog all right behind
the scenes whatever you want to call it
there are a bunch of little tasks around
the office that I have been neglecting
to do for the last Oh month to 12 months
out serious procrastination going on
here so I've got a list right here all
right some things that need to get done
today I have to put my 79 80 XE back
into the elite build have to run an
Ethernet cable neatly and cleanly from
our server to the switch I have to
rebuild the man vs. build giveaway PC I
have to install RGB speakers on our our
little set back here and hang up the
damn posters so that's what we're doing
today if all that stuff sounds really
boring to you then you should probably
stop watching this video now but if not
then come along on my quest as I go
about doing stupid chores around the
office alright it's finally time to get
this asshole back in the system it's
been like I don't know 10 months since I
had this thing working properly I have
to be really careful because remember
this has been deleted twice already and
I don't want it to pop off I don't want
the IHS to pop off because I did not
permanently reseal it back to the
substrate and I'm actually mounting it
in the system with the chassis upright
which is not not great but putting this
thing on its side is there's no easy
task so mounted all right I think the
hardest part is done by getting the CPU
in there without the IHS falling off now
I gotta put that damn homework
where's the model boy here it is I
probably shouldn't kept it like that for
so long but it looks fine
it's totally fine I do need some thermal
paste first see we got barely just
enough here alright it's kind of awkward
applying thermal paste from this
position oh I was not the best I've done
let me just try to even it out can you
guys I'm also trying to like angle
myself so you guys can see it on camera
makes it even more difficult but that's
that's that's not terrible it's a little
off-center isn't it I guess that's what
I get for applying it from this
perspective so let me just all right I'm
gonna try to like add just a tiny bit
more and simultaneously
it over oh it's a little goopy little
goopy they're getting some verge vibes
all right hold on let me get it out here
oh come on oh it's actually not terrible
I do want to suck some of it up though
just like that suck it all right that
looks pretty good let's let's mount this
sucker oh you know what oh I almost
forgot I actually have to place a
thermal pad back on to the BRM right
over these MOSFETs right over these
Mossy's right here give me a sec oh boy
oh that's a stretch thermal pad here is
not quite as sticky as it used to be all
right I got to do this quickly oh wait
oh I still have some pegs in here I
have some standoffs from a Sutekh cooler
that I mounted in here for testing
earlier forgot to remove those thermal
paste is dripping down thermal pad can
be falling off at any minute this is
great okay yeah remember this is not a
tutorial one more one more good screw so
I need really make sure that's on there
yeah
use your fingering power all right so at
this point got to put the fittings back
in here so for starters I can put this
guy back in easy-peasy
easy there it is beautiful oh my God
look at that GPU sag man man that is
some wicked sag there bro wicked sag
okay I think we're pretty much good to
fill the loop do we have distilled water
fortunately I still have some leftover
coolant from Thermaltake can you go have
fun make good choices
all right loop time to watch you bleed
all right we've got our paper towel down
there in case we have any leaks and we
are ready to give clip the power supply
on and power no too shabby any leaks any
leaks anywhere anyone anyone no it looks
like we're good we're in good shape my
bros all right shall we shall we plug
her in like to the monitor and just make
sure that it's actually booting in stuff
that our temps are normal let's check
temps
all right test boot here we go wait for
it wait for it come on come on come on
let's see it where are you at well it's
happening I don't like the looks of this
getting a bad vibe
hold on hold on
oh you see it oh oh thank god
oh thank God I thought maybe there was a
leak I didn't see and it got on the
video card or something oh my geez I was
I was getting worried oh it's looking
good
oh damn it oh thank god oh think uh
indicate the keyboard yeah go there you
go ah welcome back elite build it's nice
to have you here alright we've got media
encoder ready to go let's go ahead and
render some shirt and take a look here
it looks like we are running at four
gigahertz you go before gig here at Sun
well of course let's give it a little
bit longer just give it a chance to warm
up and then we'll check our temps in a
few min all right we are just over seven
minutes into our render here I don't
know I'm talking in southern accent
package temp is 82 see that is down from
a hundred and four degrees Celsius
before I had deleted that chip just FYI
so we're down over 20 degrees see from
that deal it and of course popping it in
the elite build is doing it all the
favors right now so I think we can
officially say that our first tour of
the day is done this is a room that does
give feature very often this is where we
keep our server threatened horizon 7
1764 gigs of DDR 4 memory which is not
ECC it's probably the only server in
history that has tried NZ or GB modules
in there we really need to get some ECC
in there but the real the real bread
butter here is our 24 bay disk shelf
with 92 terabytes of redundant storage
look at that oh it's so sexy so this
whole thing is connected by an Ethernet
cable that runs out of the room all the
way into the hallway along the wall you
can see whoo all the way over there
yeah I'm gonna back around goes under
this little cabinet here past our
printer and to our switch our 10 gigabit
ethernet switch right there so it's it's
kind of a mess when in reality it should
really just start from the server go up
the wall in that room and then come back
down where all these other cables are
going I've done this wiring myself as
soon as we got into the studio but since
then I've gotten lazy and I've just been
like yeah you know we've got a
hundred-foot ethernet cable what's
what's the point I'll do it later
I always keep saying that I'll do it
later I'll do it later but the time has
come where later is now I'm gonna go get
a stool I hope you know at all that's
the thing I hope our stool is tall
enough for me to actually reach to the
ceiling because I'm I'm really short and
our stool is also kind of short so let
me
oh boy oh boy um do you think I'll be
able to reach up there let's see yeah
this is as far as I get how things gonna
work now we do have a ladder but it's
actually at our house right now and I
don't really think this video through
when I was leaving the house this
morning so you know it really sucked is
that we could have asked the maintenance
crew who operates out of this building
to borrow their ladder which we've done
in the past but it's well past 6:00 p.m.
at this point and I know for a fact
they've already gone home for the day so
I guess I'm just gonna have to do this
at another time looks like a vertical
challenged not accepted
all right so remember man versus build
remember the last episode of man vs.
build well we built the system and we're
supposed to give it away unfortunately
there was something wrong with that
system the MSI motherboard I don't know
if it's the motherboards fault or just
our fault for handling it in such a
rough way but I wasn't bitten wasn't
butand at all I tried all the things and
it drove me crazy so I was like you know
what screw it I'm just gonna swap it out
for a different motherboard so that was
the MSI z3 70 i gaining we're swapping
it out for this 370 I Strix
I already did some troubleshooting with
it and this boards working just fine so
everything you see here this is kind of
where I left off and I've been again
this this was supposed to go out like
weeks and weeks ago I feel really bad
for the giveaway winner but I want to
make damn sure that the PCs are getting
works when it arrives so let's go ahead
and put this guy together
there she is
yeah yeah thanks you Purdy
no she ain't but she'll boot Oh she'll
boot I tell you okay let's try that out
real quick all right so proof proof that
it boots here we go
I got it I got to turn the power supply
on first that's false alarm power supply
kay
shut up I can see you laughing I can see
you laughing at me I don't appreciate it
hi wifey sauce might be sauce is on
camera
who's laughing now yeah it's not so easy
camera head you'll go to your camera
head all right turning it on that's more
like it
fans are spinning all right come on give
me that six of splash screen and let me
say it show me the goods
okay we can we can pack this up we can
pack this up now looks good and wifey
sauce will ship it out to the winner
finally sorry dude I forget your name
but I I apologize it's taking me so long
your systems working now so all is good
my friend Wow let's move on to the next
chore
so back in my Newegg days when i used to
work there
there was a cool awesome rep named patty
who I still keep in touch with she now
works for Logitech believe she worked
for Asus at the time that she went over
to Nvidia now she's at Logitech she
follows me on here we follow each other
on Instagram it's a whole thing and she
saw a picture of my setup
you know the setup that I usually shoot
at for my videos most of the time and
she was like you know what would go
really great with your setup you know
what it's missing I said what patty what
she said a g6 she's in the g4 m60 she
said a set of g5 60 speakers and I said
I think you're right patty wanting to
send me a set so she did that's exactly
what she did I actually haven't seen any
reviews on this gas so I'm not sure how
they sound but it does have RGB lighting
so I'm sure it sounds great
all right let's set this guy up seems
pretty straightforward we've got a large
sub woofer there's big Boston in here
you know I got to take this terrible
sticker off first
oh god bless you god bless u Logitech
thank you for making that easy get down
and dirty ow
I hit my head on the pole it's fine I'm
fine that barely fits he said never to
me though
sometimes or one of those things where
like you're like I'll just write one zip
tie and then you're like oh that's so
good I'm gonna do ten more yes yeah now
we've got two satellite speakers they're
pretty large which makes me think
they're fairly powerful I looked on the
Box 240 watts there's a lot more than I
was expecting just passing through
just passing through to you it's not a
song but I wish it was time to plug in
the tweeters oh it's hot they turned the
a/c off a long time ago in this building
hey I'm feeling it Wow now what's cool
about the speaker system is that you can
connect it to your system in three
different ways
3.5 millimeter cable USB cable or
Bluetooth I'm gonna go the microUSB
route so I already have one hanging down
from here actually and I'm one of the
connect it from the rear Hale from the
rear
we all look the same no we don't that's
not true all right okay I think we're
ready to turn it on oh so clearly the
lights are reacting in stuff to the
sound light sync and all
let's look at the YouTube video play
some musica
Wow actually sounds pretty good
I am immersed
wifey sauce is not amused because we're
here late at the office and she wants to
go home put the speakers sound great
thanks Logitech
last to do item of the day is to hang up
the posters these posters were purchased
by us shortly after we moved into the
studio over a year ago and since then
they've literally just been standing
against the wall here if we actually got
to dust them down at some point - that's
how long it's been so finally we're
gonna hang these suckers up and wouldn't
you know it
stool is actually tall enough for me for
this job in particular so let's get er
done
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah what a
difference that makes to the room it
looks so much more badass in here but uh
hey we got I got no we buy your sauce
help we got a lot of stuff done today
and I feel like a real adult so kudos to
us thank you guys so much for tuning in
to this little chores video now it's
kind of weird toss a like on the video
if you enjoyed it and get subscribe for
more tech stuff coming at you really
soon till next time guys have a good one
