start the show
what's up everybody this is awesome
hardware episode 116 hey guys if I
remember how to count and this is a live
show that Paul and I do every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right
here on twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
on YouTube we like to split up into two
halves that was nothing nothing happened
nothing you just scream and people think
you crazy but at least they won't think
you forgot to mute your laptop
alright so we'd like to split this show
up into two halves on YouTube so this
week the first half is on my channel
youtube.com slash c / big wits and then
in about an hour so we're gonna switch
it over to Paul's channel youtube.com
slash Paul's Hardware you can go ahead
and find that link in the description of
this YouTube video if you guys are just
watching this on Twitch just stay where
you are
you're already in the right place we're
gonna be streaming constantly channel
and yeah a little upsell or a beautiful
moderator and friend
what up old school everybody else we're
Watchers yes yeah yeah yeah it's gonna
be a fun show I can feel it I feel it my
bones
it's gonna be great and I'm obligating
to say that because it's a show that I
coast I actually feel like it is I feel
like a weight is being lifted after
we're kind of clawing our way out of the
 week that's true
oh sorry because sometimes on the show -
dad that was a good way to impose that
point
apologies super those of you who are
offended by that occasionally we curse
as we drink beer usually we like to make
the announcement that we curse before we
actually yeah sorry oh no that's okay
you go ahead I was gonna choose but you
gotta get all ears what do you tell me

things so my store is biblioth√®que
slash store yeah things you can buy a
limited edition navy tri-blend shirt

from just the usual black shirts that I
sell in my store black is generally my
favorite you know color of choice when
it comes to t-shirts but this is a
little bit addition to anyone your stars

to the store so quickly now that's a
very lovely very lovely blend it's a
great shirt and you can also buy fidget

no John is said no because John you're
sending emails now saying like like why
do you hate me instead you know what I
spent a good a good sick I don't know
how many hours doing over the past 24
hours removing links from every single
one of my youtube videos now that was
something I needed to add to my to-do
list
yeah yeah Heather's doing that for me
tomorrow yeah so that was fun anyway my
store is here if you guys wanna buy some
stuff I do mugs effect classes it's all
new high quality stuff yep thanks for
your support if you do I will shout your
name at the end of the show if you buy
stuff no no never mind about the buying
stuff together right
you paid disaster submit shipping
Calista Chipping prices have decreased a
little bit you get the International
price shipping is still outrageously
expensive let's move on to our first
segment that's what we call them it's
hot in heavy hardware we talked about
hardware that's hot and heavy coming up
soon this is from a data they were
launching their fastest SSD ever there
sssst not the fastest SSD but that's so
exciting it's the xpg falls under their
xpg series which is they also make DDR
give you our memory under the under that
series and now we're seeing an m2 SSD
appear under the xpg branding this is
the X X I'm sorry SX 9000 PCIe gen3 by
for MGM a SSD inspector features of
Marvel have we seen an MDOT 2 + SSD hey
have you seen that ended up to nvme dry
form a dough to get if we have it has it
really made much much head which news
hasn't I haven't heard of it so this
might be one of the first and it's
featuring that a Marvel controller
Marvel controller there is not much info
on their product page about the
controller itself that just says it's
Marvel and it's got sequential reads and
writes of up to 2800 let's say yes yes
oh they do
hey where'd you get this believe it or
not it's the XP g sx 8000 okay so this
is like sort of the the successor to
that what it that one sucks now yeah now
I'm disappointed that that I have that
man I guess I can just keep it all the
sound I bought that
oh you bought it yes Wow see see guys US
tech reviews we actually buy things
ourselves sometimes SSDs SSDs are the
kind of thing I can still impulse buy I
can still be like I need more SSDs like
I just I always do I agree especially
like a little like little 5 500 gig nvme
SSD drives for test beds now oh like I
need I need one for each one yes they
with it's so nice cuz it's just there
you never have to worry about SATA
cables or say to say that any of that
garbage
it is nice yeah unless unless the the
OSD I'm not to spot is underneath where
the graphics card mats that can be
sometimes pain but I totally get you
alright so this is a 2 SSD apparently
the newer bigger brother of the SX 8000
the apologist but Paul you're irrelevant
congratulations three hundred and ten
thousand and one hundred and forty
thousand I ops for the random four caves
and rights respectively howling dogs
very fast drive actually to
will be offered in 256 512 and 1
terabyte capacities
I put 11 terabyte capacity that's sorry
everybody
they did it has been touting great
durability and reliability for these
drives claiming that there's a thousand
terabyte twb or total bytes written is
that right
total written bytes but then the article
says total bytes written the article or
the acronym seems a little bit off from
what it means but whatever happened some
time this total bytes written made this
total bytes written but it is the
acronym definitely twb and not tvw
because this is how it was written the
article might have been typo movement it
okay well we'll call it TB w then and an
mtbf a lot of acronyms here which is the
mean time between failures a more common
term that's a figure of two million
hours so pretty much two million hours
of just write write cycles I can that
can occur before things maybe you go
south where leveling is also supposed to
aid and durability on this drive it'll
also include a I don't know if here is
included one but an XP g-sync I haven't
opened it yet
oh you haven't even opened it good
Laurie you can never tell with I'm not
too dry because you're so light already
so damn light and light goods totally
empty still sealed okay see on the box
fresh brand-new they can still return it
from the ESX 9000 that's true
a data should have a step up program so
it does come with a heat sink with
pre-applied thermal compound on it
that's useful which is optional of
course you don't need to use it'll be
interesting to see if anyone tests that
see how effective it is does also pack a
five-year warranty no mention of price
how much was that 512 gig version that
model are you not at liberty to say no
you don't need impulse buys when your
impulse buying it doesn't you don't
really look at the price it was months
ago okay I'm sure someone could just do
a quick Google search people look I'm
like camel camel camel or something you
can see the price history yeah I'd have
to like cross-reference that what was it
on sale or something why'd you go with
that one specifically or was just one of
the cheaper ones that was
was available uh I was it's supposed to
be Furtick Panther oh okay
but I haven't a nice I haven't rebuilt
our Connecticut so nice yeah you know
self-conscious haven't done anything but
hotline so long everybody Panther cow
okay these are pieces that I'm
completely disassembled it yeah no yes
I'm suppose I'm supposed to have the
water clean stuff on the way I'm getting
I'm gonna do I'm getting the monoblock
for the X $2.99 Strix the Asus rgx $2.99
districts so send me my first monoblock
builds which is kind of fun and also
cool also hopefully a good application
of a monoblock because the Exton any
nine VRMs can get pretty toasty so
you're going next $2.99 me why not why
not thread Ripper I'll just ask him
before Chad knows because I'm gonna do a
thread river water cooled build - that's
cool the best reason I mean I completely
understand anyone who you know will hate
on the Intel CPUs because of their
prices that doesn't mean they're not
functional CPUs yeah in and I have them
yeah and I haven't think about like if I
have like a ten core high-end process
they're gonna frickin use it I want to
use it yeah and that kind of thing I'm
probably gonna actually do the eight
core though really yeah I don't know I
might I'm still up in the air we're
still it's a don't worry guys do you
ever when you're looking at a menu at a
restaurant you're trying to decide what
to eat do you ever just not decide and
maybe you have a few things that you may
be on and then you just make a snap
decision when the server asks you yeah
I've done this it's like that but it
seems like you're pretty set on an 8
quart or you're not I'm not I just it's
it's supposed it's gonna be primarily
for gaming and I'm pretty sure they core
would be able to overclock better than
the hair okay one of those things you
guys Lee swap it but I burn yeah
yeah everybody made you know wrong
assumptions about that platform anyway
so cool we'll see how yes indeed that's
very exciting either way so I wish you
luck on that thank you yeah and guys I
see you guys donating in chat thank you
very much we will be responding to all
the messages you attach to those
donations at the end of each half of the
show so don't worry we are seeing you
and we won't get around to you
so um continue giving us lots of money
alright let's move on to our next
article our next piece of hot and heavy
hardware which is the BitFenix tempered
glass case which you can buy on the
cheap my brothers and sisters it's the
Nova the Nova TG which stands for
tempered glass the Nova is our the Nova
TG is a follow-up to the existing Nova
and it looks like you've got a call on
your on your watch from from not a
number and four note from from a ghost
how much you can if your mass-producing
tempered glass side panels how much you
know cheaply you can you can make them
for it seems like they're getting them
from pretty cheap because this case is
only 60 bucks and it comes with a full
four millimeter thick piece of tempered
glass on the left side panel and it
looks looks pretty decent I mean for a
$60 case you can definitely tell it's a
it's it's it's on the budget side when
you look at things like the drive cage
and like it's got a five and a quarter
inch base still maybe not the most room
behind the motherboard tray for cable
management and that sort of thing but I
will admit that the tempered glass if
there's one thing that could really amp
up the look or overall appearance of
your system it's replacing that acrylic
sort of you know already scratched by
the time you get it Sai panel window
with a full piece of tempered glass it
is a premium feeling sort of definitely
it definitely is it almost makes you
forget about all the other crappy parts
of the case but it makes me wonder
because the tempered glass is also like
it's there's a certain density to it you
know which is like fixed you know that
does it can't you can't really change it
so it makes me wonder if you had a case
that was
you know if you if you buy a super
budget 30 $40 case you know they're
flimsy as hell they're super lightweight
yeah I'm wondering as you get more and
more budget cases with tempered glass
side panel windows like just how's that
gonna feel like hmm is it gonna is it
gonna be maybe it reinforces it it's
gonna be like really heavy on the side
that the tempered glass is on I guess
once you build the rest of the system in
it wouldn't be a bit true yeah once you
have the motherboard in there yeah baby
right that the front panel doesn't look
quite as as plush I know like but think
these also aren't that and create a
picture Zadok true yeah but at the very
least it's one of those things where I
feel like like a case like this you're
more so focused on what's inside of the
system than the outside right it's got a
very minimalistic sort of outward
appearance there's nothing fancy going
on it's not an eyesore but it's not
necessarily something that you want to
look at so really all the focus there
goes to the inside of your rig which a
lot of people are doing now because RGB
is on everything every single component
now pretty much has an RGB option so if
you want to show that off then this
might be a good potential way to do it
let the light shine through yeah I mean
and you guys can all look at the specs
of the original Nova there's a slight
there's a slight modification to the
internal layout it's got to included 120
millimeter fans there's another amount
for that for one of those at the front
it supports three three and a half inch
and two two and a half inch drives
there's also a five and a quarter inch
bay remember those those are fun they
can be useful at times they can be yeah
I have not even do one in a long time
but it's one of those things where it's
like it's good to have it when you need
it yeah definitely let's move on to our
next story here for how heavy hardware
this is the last one for this segment
apparently there's been a 480 Hertz
monitor spotted in the wild kind of
Asterix kind of this is an article from
blur Buster's or originally from blur
Busters and then recited by PC gamer
calm but blur Buster's is claiming to
have received a prototype 480 Hertz
display in their facility the author of
the article mentions that it's actually
a 120 Hertz 4k display
that is capable of hitting high refresh
rates at lower resolutions it's like a
1080 you can do for any yeah exactly
right so we don't know we're pretty sure
that it's gonna be 1080 that makes the
most sense and we already have 4k 144
Hertz displays around the corner and I
think from like from Acer definitely
from Asus I think Acer and Asus are
kindly surnames as opposed to both have
one like lineup or on that I might have
to show yes more up more in Pauls good
luck and and it'll be interesting to see
if those panels are able to hit higher
refresh rates at if you were to dial
down the resolution any there's no
mention if this prototype features
g-sync or freesync just from the looks
of it I mean it is a prototype so it's
it's almost impossible to tell what
panel this is if it's like one of those
Korean displays or from a bigger
manufacturer it's kind of got this
silver bezel to it and I don't I can't
tell if like they what's it it looks
like it's just floating on part of a
stand or maybe oh that's it that's a
wall mount or I'm sorry yes mount looks
like then mounted on an arm or something
like that which is weird I don't know
why they'd mount the piece across the
front here that reads your mind anyone
else notice that yeah spoiler alert
minor spoiler alert the 480 Hertz
feature is also new it's like the least
interesting thing about this so we'll
definitely keep an eye on this anything
you know anything to push the boundaries
of you know modern gaming displays is is
always it's always fun I'm excited to
try it
me too it'll be the new thing big the
human eye yeah I can't see past 144
Hertz stupid 480 Hertz I could totally
tell the difference yeah but once you
try 480 bro will change your diet
compete all right let's move on to our
next segment here we've got some other
stories yes csgo pros will still wine
yes you that ghost just keeps on calling
yeah
not disturb alright
games report we haven't done I feel like
we haven't done games reporting a while
maybe for a few weeks now but there's a
couple things I want to mention because
they're interesting and they're about
gaming and you know we like games here
you know I feel like most of our
audiences are gamers we just they just
like to hear more so about the hardware
that that drives the games and the games
themselves but there's there's some
hardware stuff here not in this article
though this is about Blizzard who has as
a company they tried changing the the
battlenet name to just the Blizzard app
yeah I was like everyone we've flipped
or Shaklee aware of this but me too
I had no idea until today stupid it's
this it is dumpin thing I don't
understand why they would change
perfectly good name it was so cool
because battle.net even had the URL
battle.net yeah head was in that I it's
been that forever for likes been bad
years since I played Starcraft I'm not
originally the original Starcraft right
and that's why everyone like went up in
arms and like just what Thor as
soon as Blizzard changed it to the
Blizzard app which is significantly far
less interesting stupider um and it's a
personal thing I think because you know
people have grown up with blue sorry
battle.net this has sort of been like a
hub a central hub for all Blizzard
players of all these different IPS to
sort of come together and and play games
together it's really been just sort of
like a central hub hangout spot a huge
huge huge huge element as the author of
this article from Mashable says
battlenet is kind of part of blizzards
DNA at this point so the company has
decided to stay semi true to the
original name okay um so now it's now
they're calling it blizzard battlenet
they've just put Blizzard at the front
of it Oh
which I mean doesn't really rob the time
probably I used to like awkwardly
pronouncing like hyphenated names like
that since Activision took them over and
like they've been saying Activision
blues
for like ever so now they're sure now
they think that they can just combine it
with you later blizzard battle.net
sounds not stupid
that's that also sounds stupid feather I
mean you can call it blizzards
battle.net s' but you don't not like all
the time it's like if it's one of those
things were like every time an employee
says it they have to say Blizzard
battle.net or you can really never say
because we have to brand it that way or
said that's stupid as dumb see I I get
the feeling that people will just
continue calling it battle.net
anyway like because cuz the Blizzard
part is sort of redundant everyone
already knows it's been it's been thirty
seven eight over twenty thirty years
since since battle.net existed you don't
need to specify that it's blizzards at
any rate people are probably happy now
that it's been sort of sort of changed
back to the old name
so battle.net will live on forever
for now until they change it again
who knows alright next next story here
hey hey player unknowns battlegrounds is
it now hexa-core + optimized no good
picks a core and more optimized this
comes as of last week the week 20 update
this was a patch that started rolling
out last week containing both optimized
game performance for six core or higher
CPUs and a new optimized DUI so I'm sure
all of you are aware of this game by now
player node battlegrounds is the takes
place usually always on a huge map on a
huge map with up to 100 or so players my
knowledge and apparently you know the
developers have optimized it so that if
you have a hexa core CPU which maybe
even a year ago would be like well who
has one of those only like the high-end
desktop user release nobody but now why
would we optimize for something like
that yeah exactly we're all on quad core
some of us are still on dual cores
Jimmy's got a single-core but now we've
got rise in which which give us gives us
very affordable hexa core CPUs you're
looking for but I was that was thank you
I don't have my usual keychains do they
took wifey sauces car today but I have
her keys she's Gatlin she has a Boston
lobster keychain open air bottle opener
fast an elapsed I got her that packed
East when we went to packed East long
time ago Wow it's old school you know I
was direct Paul was there all probably
watch me buy this fascinating
information right I don't remember that
specifically how I do not remember that
monumental moment oh and he shoots he
scores
I mean it well done I am coordinated
coordinated nice pun course let's talk
about course
so with Rison already settle in we've
also got Intel releasing or unveiling
their coffee lake or they have just sort
of already unveiled their coffee like
CPUs and they're just around the bend
they revealed that they'll be revealing
their yes yes they've confirmed that it
exists and stuff which are also gonna be
hexa core CPUs there's going to be some
of those that are six core processors so
um player unknown there they're on top
of things they're seeing the trends and
they are taking action well I mean
they're damaging you're doing incredibly
well already like they the tweet that
they have in the article is when they
broke they've been breaking the records
for Steam concurrent players and stuff
like that recently oh yeah they beat out
disco yeah they're not even their
disease it's not even like lunched yet
the game is still in beta
it's an early access your the asset
excess right so I mean yeah if anyone's
you pick up battlegrounds is watching I
doubt that but what would be really cool
is like some kind of benchmark with pick
up keep sleep wake up battlegrounds
player gnomes fellow console I don't
where I get use a very common acronym
for pick but anyway kind of benchmark
who can be runs that wouldn't that you
could do that would roughly simulate the
game that wouldn't really jump into the
multiplier environment because that's a
difficulty but
benchmarking something like that is
multiplayer there's just a lot of
variables that you can't really control
that kind of thing yes absolutely
but yeah that's cool yeah um listen to
Paul play unknown do it now I would like
that as well I'm sure we all would I
have even had several requests with all
that they get benchmarks like well you
do player like no one plays ashes of the
singularity every was blimpliner no
battleground look your best match look
at the benchmark it's because it's it's
super easy to benchmark ashes and it's
not easy at all the benchmark
battlegrounds oh no I'm gonna do some
more gameplay of benchmarks soon cuz I
did those a couple weeks a few weeks
back and and it's fun cuz actually got
to play the game for a bit yeah and also
you know show that the performance of
stuff so I'm gonna do that play some
benchmark sometimes aren't a
experiencial enough yeah sometimes they
need to be um let's see okay pictograms
would just be a huge bar a huge bar
thank yous bar where guys fight to the
death they would like the hot chicks
that's a game I play
alright and then our final game there
our final article for four games report
is about you know hey have you guys ever
played oh gee doom like the original
doom and just thought there's a
significant lack of crash bandicoot
memes in this game well if you have like
I know all of you have there's there's a
new mod there's a new mod for the very
popular game that started it all as do
muds just that they just never go away
they never get old they never leave when
will it end who knows turns all the
enemies into crash bandicoot's yes so
there's a cry like we're so old and
irrelevant now Paula
I didn't even aware of this crash
bandicoot whoa meme that has been
popularized on like sites like Reddit
and 4chan where its crash bandicoot
saying oh wow I would feel bad I would
feel bad if there was never any means
that I wasn't familiar with
I think there's gotta be you know what I
mean means that you don't know or you
like you have to not know
how that may mean works and they got
looking up and then fortunately there's
a whole wealth of information on the
internet of like explaining oh this is
that beam can be derived from this ya
cetera here's the entire you know
history of its etymology and all that
kind of stuff I think it's like like
it's like pretty exciting though I kind
of want to bad luck Brian who knows
everything has never been late when can
they do this with with like quake though
like I'm why not because I like some
old-school doom it's just whenever you
whenever you jump in it like mumbles
last time you played it some old-school
doom it's fine a while back like never I
tried it like a year ago I forget what
the contacts you wants but it's like you
forget that you can't even vertically
there's no vertically right all you're
doing is I'm excited to say that makes
it easier
it makes it easier but it's just one it
makes it a very different experience as
a shooter yes it's um most shooters that
has correct to go back to that seems
like limiting right yeah when whereas at
the time it was cutting edge there was
nothing else like it so yeah it's
definitely challenging to go back but
but people are still playing OG do and
believe it or not like I think we are at
an AMD not the last tech day but there
was an AMD or review as the Nvidia event
that we went to in San Francisco earlier
this year where during the whole like
press conference presentation some dude
like some like journalist next to us at
the table Nexus was just playing dude
and on his laptop the whole time
actually playing dude thank you I was
like oh I want to do that it's mine way
more energy from oisin learning stupid
GPU architectures attacking so um anyway
I just thought I would brighten all of
your days with with this awful
information has a great anecdote Cal yes
thank you very much and let's move on
the show is moved up I think we've taken
the show to a higher level we have just
for you to pause at this point let you
guys know the show just got a little bit
better yep
doesn't happen often it usually it's the
the contrary you guys we're here for it
let's uh let's move on to our next
segment
though which is face off this is a
segment where Paul and I go head-to-head
in a crappy online two-player game that
I randomly pull out of my butt and then
the loser has to do something embarrass
right stupid what oh you mean
metaphorically yeah okay yeah I wouldn't
let you play neck I wouldn't pull some
Hungry Hungry Hippos out of your ass
right now pal I would be I'd be curious
I'd be vaguely curious Hungry Hungry
Hippos in my butt that's what I call it
Cole I just I'm imagining if you're
gonna pull a game out of here but it's
gotta because somehow Hungry Hippos
is what comes to mind we're chutes and
ladders or somebody's some
letters so yeah I feel like this is a
trending twitter topic like like hashtag
like I'm giving you pull out of your
guns you pull out your butt can we get
that trending no we can't
yes we can no no we can't we're not
anywhere near that doesn't have that
level of influence like I don't want
that level of him no I'm trying to make
this large so people can see it I found
this game it's called Dragon Ball
fighting this is one of those games
that's like based on a very popular IP
that I'm like okay it's a good thing
you're a really small game that no one
knows about otherwise you've probably
got a lawsuit on your hands but yeah
it's it's Dragon Ball Z characters
fighting to the death
it was right up our alley Paul all right
we both need the keyboard right yeah
that's right this keyboard hasn't has a
lengthy cord yeah plenty of length on
that cord plenty length just beware you
know it's okay so we're gonna play this
I'm using the wrong Mouse we're gonna
play this game Kyle just explain what it
is yep that brings you guys up to speed
EU oh that is Dragon Ball Z characters
for sure
indeed it is the most Asian this
fun fact I did not preview or test this
game at all so I got no idea well it's
your half of the show so I guess your
riskier but this is we gonna get flagged
for no of course not maybe we should
turn the music down though yeah maybe is
that the actual Dragon Ball Z music I
have no idea I thought you were the
Dragon Ball Z guy ok 9000 the the Dragon
Ball Z saga is is beyond my figure it's
huge I do not recognize this song I do
not recognize just I did not quite the
the Dragon Ball Z lore master is
everything yes I am not you would not I
do not know the soundtrack off the top
my head for all the just just merely a
humble thin yes I'm a merely merely a
humble thing I don't claim to be a
whatever whatever they call massive
Dragon Ball Z fans dragon dragon dragon
dragon balls suck ulcers I do not know
dragon blue ballers I don't know fanboy
dragon ball fondlers' okay I am NOT I
don't claim to be a dragon ball faun
this is the only thing I can click up so
I have to assume that's what I'm
clicking oh jeez I didn't realize did
not realize do you know no let's just
just this is the game assume this is one
player this is to play a game is started
seven obviously do you even know if this
is a two-player game it was under the
two-player games section I looked up two
player items that making you play
another choice here one two or three
three three era doing choice through
here okay good to know
I is our only option back goes this info
all right go back and I was just like
about oh three the first one and then
maybe it'll give us do the second one is
this us
hey no no okay that's it that's a I cuz
I'm neither of us doing that I'm gonna
do it on the left okay I'm winning so is
this the game we just put bets on who's
the heaven I'm winning you're getting me
asking I like the graphics I mean for a
cabin 8-bit thing oh well oh look one
player two player this looks like it's
working sort of right okay perhaps
select your guy it looks like we can
only be two guys unless well they're
grayed out so go on go on and then I'll
be Crillon you should be Crillon cuz he
looks like you shut up never make fun of
bald people and I look like Gohan to be
fair all right so they can RPG yeah whoa
whoa really I think you're the best a
here your thumbnail it looked like this
side scrolling stroll with eiders
alright with it alright we're gonna go
into this temple here look we're gonna
maybe have to press one or two okay
oh no it's a co-op game well this is

I'm two-player I'll answer that you got
any what first player anyway wait I'm
first
yeah oh jeez I don't know there we go I
can't believe we're actually playing
this game with all those menus and the
random choices we made I know how do and
then actually kick in this guy's ass I
have several abilities but it's
difficult to say oh look at that
yeah you're a nice palm kick his ass
I'm gonna long so funny that I keep
hitting him with okay
come on he nailed me I know you're a
vegan lobby bitch just pressing random
buttons I found that Jay does something
the keys do yeah I found hope
oh there's two guys now right put
they're running away
oh nice combo there's several this lots
of dudes
oh my god suddenly I'm really in the
mood for bacon okay craving bacon so
hard right now
come on it essentially has some pretty
good mechanics like that but I feel like
it's a pentile and we should just play
this game for the rest of the time I'm
down this will be your whole half of the
show second half of mine the punishment
is that we both have fun die you is I
can do this powerup thing but nothing
happens these guys have lots of I got a
sexy combo right there nice pressing the
button over and over I didn't know how
to jump that's cool up up was jump for
me okay that's much simpler than my
Nikes and I think hey no nevermind I
can't jump at all I think was just a
dude hanging in the air or something
like that oh no never mind a fun jump
I'm learning I wonder if this is wave
face like you could just keep coming
until you die or something
I hope so I hope it never ends oh look
at that
oh geez
I got Dragonball let him don't let him
fall yeah keep this balls here little
ball wave yeah you know I really we're
supposed to be killing each other but we
can't we are well I mean that's what
faceoff is oh yeah no this is a new face
up where we were facing off against a
okay yes punishment will be a suck-ass
should be should we pay attention to
Chad a being like what everything's fine
it's fine we're all good by the way I
should also mention that thank god we're
running this on a high-end gaming
machine otherwise that oh oh yeah the
system would handle this this is 1080i
yep we guys going in the system as well
as a 69 50 x10 core process the only
reason that we're at all able to I mean
at this resolution with the depth the
color depth we have it set to you can
see all all the voxels I think our
viewers could have already guessed that
what the hardware we were running based
on just how smooth the frame rate was
it's not insult our audience yet so okay
looks like we both win
good good went cool that well I
shouldn't say face off is concluded
because there has to be some sort of
punishment for for the loser but since
since we're both on the same team maybe
we're both subject to punishments punish
my computer because my computer was the
AI let's let's destroy the computer
computers to drink industry pewter has
to do the little green man thing is
to be much better at it than us cuz he
wouldn't even drink yeah Gavin Paul your
computer got me so drunk and he's like
dead Sobers all right uh let's um let's
check some beer
the conclusion we have reached let's
check some beer video ciao so much
better moving it over here yeah way
better yeah I improved things as you
made I just I had the head a head xsplit
over here and I was having to like look
all the way back to make sure things
were doing right oh yeah all right we're
trading beer beer yep okay let's see I
could fill mine up
wait what percentage is this beer that
you're drinking this is a Lagunitas
Imperial step which is nine point nine
percent I am NOT chugging this I'll tell
ya I'll take a healthy swig should
should I grab the other beers what the
the 212 but the 12 ounce beers that I
got the black lagers the lighter beers
why Emily so we can check them cuz
you're gonna chuck B's right
oh we're chugging beers and regardless
of it there's no okay sure yeah yeah you
do that
yeah all right so now I'm left alone on
cattles half of the show to do what I
will to say what I can finally say now
that I'm saying I like men you seem like
a perfect time to come out
why wouldn't I like men Kyle men are
people many men friends yeah and lovers
I I consider you a man friend this is
disappointing but I considered you a man
lover Musso to me - sorry this sparked
my special boy alright so I guess we'll
just pound this week what is this end
let's hope this isn't like all so
ridiculous lack lager
doesn't say so much because I guess
we'll just risk it alrighty it's always
checking out sample but I guess we'll do
our best
like had to say doesn't have to say
maybe it says on the actual box is it
hidden it doesn't it doesn't taste such
damage the bottle actually has a compass
on it it has a north south east and west
oh yeah
you mean ties it's like that's also part
of their logos look like a compass
they're going west from west to east
it's organic it's an organic beer well
it can't be bad to chug then it's
healthy and that was my next logical
step as well right well I'm making that
difficult to pound out of a bottle but
yeah but it's alright we can't do it cuz
we're Kurt glasses are occupied that's
okay I'll just get to watch this Chuck
for a longer period of time we'll give a
shot all right
to our help Cheers see I can't do that
too much air
I pour it all over you that's impressive
I'm Jesus whoo I'm impressed yeah that
would not have been good with the IPA
but the Baba black lawyer is very
drinkable barley and hops
I'm Injuns
no actually I don't want to know it's
fine I really hurry it's not like don't
worry about it over 7% we're getting it
food after and and my wife's gonna drive
us it's gonna be great actually what
wifey sauce is making dinner tonight so
well you get it hang out at least until
my wife gets home okay okay sorry I'm
lying behind okay what's next what's
next
Oh God aah I think my right eye started
watering
burps come in like you guys yeah and I
think part of check out the beer for me
is like the burp that is waiting inside
of you
it's just like all this gas expanding
but we did it we did it
good Jeff yay yay we're awesome won we
won something we won I let's never do
face off again and I guess now we can
move on to our last segment of today's
show which is tech news news whoo yes do
it
all right um let's let's talk first
about um RX Vega and the pricing
situation that's going on right now a
lot of articles have been coming out and
this is all sort of based off of a rumor
that was a part of the OSI UK forum so
again this is all speculation and rumor
right now actually uploaded a video
earlier that that that mentioned it and
sort of discussed it briefly but
apparently according to the rumor the
for the the the prices that you saw at
launch for RX Vega 56 and 64
there it is we're just launch prices
we're just special early adopter launch
prices and they are allegedly going to
increase by $100 for each car so that
means make 56 is going from 399 at
launch to 499 and Vega 64 from 499 to
599 for the air-cooled model which is a
news to us if this is true AMD did not
tell us as reviewers that this was going
to happen and it's kind of gotten
everyone a little bit flustered and sort
of upset especially because people
thought that they would be able to buy
they go relatively easily at launch I
think because AMD one of the reasons AMD
gave for delaying Vega as long as they
did was so that they could build up more
stock for watch and according to a lot
of people that I was following on
Twitter and other articles Vegas stock
ran out within like a minute or two
like after launch like they just they
sold so quickly that leads me to believe
that they didn't really have that many
that much inventory but that's hard to
say like that's really hard to say
unless you work at a retailer like
Newegg or Amazon or directly for AMD or
something like that and those are that's
also the types of numbers that they
typically don't tell people like you
never really know exactly how many were
out there right it was asked at the
events that we went to prior to the
launch of Vega
like what the expectation was was they
said they they gave him very positive
like oh that's strong then you know the
inventory is strong kind of response it
was asked in relative comparison to some
of the other previous launches like with
Belarus where it was very difficult to
find the cards even before the whole
cryptocurrency my anything happening
happens right and they said it wasn't
gonna be like that it was going to be
better it's entirely possible that it
was better and then were more cards and
they still all just sold out because
demand is that high or cryptocurrency
or probably a combination of both so so
that's what we're looking at here I want
to reiterate that this this article is
on WCC F Tech not the the strongest
track record of everything being on the
up-and-up it's derived from a forum post
we could go into that's a forum post
from OSI UK and so yeah we're waiting
for some kind of official response on
this I actually contacted someone at AMD
just to see if I could get something
before we went live and there's not much
at least as far as they're saying right
now mainly because the people who I have
access to aren't necessarily high up
enough to be able to say like here's
what AMD says about this right so yeah
oh oh they're really discussing right
now is that demand is very high so
selling out everywhere so prices that
you see very often are legitimate
purchases that were made from the
inventory that went up for sale
somewhere very quickly but it's bought
by a third-party reseller reseller who's
doing something like camping a website
or something like that sure and
immediately relisting it for $200 more
right because it's a brand-new launch of
a highly sought after item it's gonna
sell for more than it's worth right
excuse me do you think do you think that
these that these prices like the AMD
might be doing sort of what Nvidia did
with their founders Edition where they
sold it for sort of a premium price over
the admin board partners so that maybe
it will be you know $100 more than the
launched but when we see admin board
partner variants come out they'll
actually be slightly cheaper than than
the reference designs I mean that could
be a possibility
I like maybe so um gamers Nexus has been
taking a very close look at the PCB
along with builds I'd it's a dude who's
very very good at looking at PCBs and
identifying all the circuitry and all
the components and how much power is
being delivered where and all that kind
of stuff right that's very fascinating
to watch which is pretty cool anyway the
PCBs on the biggest 64 in the Vega 56
are the exact same PCBs that's on the
Vega front erudition they're very very
overbuilt they're very well made the
power delivery on them is like insane as
far as how it's put together in the
components it's used in everything like
that so them selling even Vegas Vega 56
for 400 bucks is like brings into
question like this is a very premium
product that is at least as far as how
they put it together when it look when
you look at like the raw cost of
components and stuff like that is this
something that they can afford to sell a
bunch of it for 399 what's going to
change when third-party manufacturers
get ahold of it like what are they going
to change as far as the power delivery
and other components that go into it
mm-hmm how's it gonna affect performance
but the fact that it's like HP m2 and
there's already been a lot of discussion
about how HBM to yields have been
challenging and that's probably what
caused the pushback if they get for so
long because yeah they can't launch with
like alright we have 300 of these
available worldwide we're gonna send
them out or something like that they
need to have some level of stock
available to have a launch like this so
I think I think that's the other
question is like yeah we don't really
know what kind of inventory they had at
launch and maybe it's true that you know
the reason why they get was delayed was
so that they could yield enough HBM to
to have a decent launch but then but
then what now type of thing right now
how long is it gonna take to to yield
enough HBM to like the second wave of
HBM to so that that users who missed the
launch have a chance to buy one of the
cars and when they do when it finally
comes around is it gonna sell out again
within 60 seconds you know and it's
gonna be frustrating for the for the end
user who's not like 100% on top like at
6:00 a.m. waiting to you know hit f5
every two seconds to buy a car so it's
it's challenging for sure you know
so yeah when something is scarce it's
gonna be hard to find and that seems to
be the case with this for sure like I
seriously doubt that this story is true
just from a from a public perspective
AMD telling a bunch of reviewers here's
the price of the cards and whatever that
doesn't like that's a really stupid
thing to for them to do if they come out
and they're like yeah this is true ever
all the cards are here two bucks more
right now like maybe that will happen
like I don't know maybe they'll come out
and say that I really doubt it because
they get a lot of negative press over
that a lot of flack the reviewers would
be pissed cuz it because the reviewers
are basing all the pricing off of the
prices that they told us they would sell
for right the fact that the cards are in
high demand that there's being sold and
then go to third parties and then being
resold by not the direct retailers so
their prices are going up like that's a
thing that happens because it's scarce
right so obviously you know we'll be
interested to hear something direct from
AMD about this even if it's just to say
like that will yeah the cards are
what the card the cards are selling for
what the cards are selling for but
they're just selling out and now and
then the prices are going up because of
resellers are their third party third
party here yeah you know that kind of
thing you know at the I mean on the
other hand if we I mean if you wanted to
play be like all right what if kinda
game if you're Andy and you're Radeon
Technology Group and even working on
Vega for however many years I'm gonna
use did they say they've been working on
it they tell us like how many years
they've worked on it in man-hours man
years invested and I know that guy stuff
it's an insane amount of time and
everything effort and everything that
they put into this if they're looking at
something like alright return on
investment look at the marketplace right
now look at how fast GPUs are selling
because of cryptocurrency and that kind
of thing we could get a lot more for our
money if we were able to sell these for
this price rather than this price and
the fact is right now regardless of what
the public backlash might be we can just
set the price to 500 bucks for the Vega
56 and 600 bucks for the Vega 64 and
they will continue to sell out
everywhere yeah because I mean crypto
cryptocurrency miners are in the in the
mindset that will just make the money
back because they're because gamers
aren't making money from gaming yeah
cryptocurrency miners are making money
from there they're treating this as an
investment gamers aren't buying cards as
an investment
miners are so even if the the prices
prices becomes inflated by a hundred
dollars after launch some miners are
still gonna see that as like well that
no problem I'll make that hundred bucks
back in a month or whatever it is and
that sort of also leads us into the
Radeon pacts and and how AMD is sort of
you know sort of sort of touted these as
as being consumer friendly and a way to
deter the miners from buying up all of
the Vegas supply but and I bet for a
percentage of people that has actually
worked I think I mean it's very because
cuz there are at least I only looked
earlier today it's been several hours
but there were there were Radeon packs
available granted you had to spend eight
hundred twelve hundred dollars on a pack
to get it but you could buy the card
with the pack yeah if you wanted about
that stuff together some of them were
pretty decent deals if you were already
interested in the stuff right how many
people overall does that actually help
out is probably a lot more limited
because not everyone's buying that exact
stuff and everyone has a bad bunch of
money and everything yeah but but you
know what I thought was kind gesture I
was thinking about it I was like the
Radeon packs like how many gamers who
are already into PC gaming really need
the bundle I mean who who really needs
the the CPU of the motherboard and
monitor and then I was thinking what
about miners like if you're a minor and
you're just like getting wave of this
new craze of cryptocurrency mining you
might like these bundles might appeal to
miners more than they do
to actual gamers actually don't know I
don't think either of us have stories
about this but there are some tests
coming out now on cryptocurrency mining
and they are not the 100 mega hash cards
that they were rumored to be by any
stretch they are even potentially not as
efficient as far as mega hash for walk
or whatever as 10 ATT eyes are possibly
with the marijuana term I don't know I
have my med card people I met Carl M
I've done research I'm a researcher
anyway so yeah they're not crazy good
mining cards but they are still
functional mining cards so that does
still mean that there might be some
interest in them anyway we are we're
gonna discuss a little bit more of vague
on my half of the show yep so let's
continue the discussion there all right
a really quick article about Intel
revealing their post eighth generation
core architecture codenamed ice lake
alright so Intel is going to be
unveiling their 8th gen core CPUs on
August 20 they need to get vanilla ice
they need to do a series of commercially
yeah but no Rice Lake watch turn that
out there yeah we'll do a mash-up
between Vanilla Ice and in the end the
night key Intel if you're watching I
know a guy who knows Vanilla Ice hmm so
like second-degree separation you know
boom Vanilla Ice pretty much you do too
oh I do too Richie oh really yeah
from doing no a dart Davis oh right
right it does the vanilla ice in the
show the vanilla ice live reality
reality show or is they did oh yeah
that's awesome it was it sucked so I'm
on the Intel website it says it says and
I quote on the on the company website
says the ice Lake processor family is
the successor to the 8th generation
Intel Core processor family these
processors utilized Intel's
industry-leading 10 nanometer + process
technology which means we were finally
seeing ah a die trace Essex ice ice Lake
is after cannon link Africa
that coffee lake coffee lake which is 14
and look how long they've been on 14
then I know so so so Intel this is
reminder that Intel has sort of
abandoned their their old tic-tock
cadence where they had you know a
process node or a process I always write
which one tick is and which one talk is
I did yes I'm doing it so be like tick
no no and be talk
Jake so I think that maybe which one's
the process which one's the shrink in
which one's the new the new architecture
one's a die straight ones that one's a
process to shrink what is it in
architecture the process wrink would be
the talk whatever doesn't matter anyway
they're all talks that talk sounds
better all the talks yeah deeper deeper
um anyway regardless of our analysis of
this whole psychic thing talk say you
can see take that you know design is a
double talk I remember is a double talk
sorry never mind
regardless Intel his has sort of just
abandoned their old people talking
tick-tock cadence okay and they've been
on 40 nanometer for a while yes they've
made some slight adjustments and
improvements to it they've iterated the
14 nanometer process now we've got 14
nanometer plus and 14 nanometer plus
plus with Katie like and coffee-like
respectively this is the first time that
Intel to my knowledge has has drilled
out the plus designations a triple talk
it's a triple talk sure you know and
it's you know there's tons of
speculation as to why they've forgotten
the old tic-tock method we're not gonna
get into that right now the important
thing is that ice Lake has is sort of
been confirmed by by Intel in a weird
way on their websites and this is
potentially going to be a part of their
ninth generation core family as a
successor to Kenan Lake which is going
to be on the 10 nanometer process with
ice lake being a iterated version of
that 10 nanometer plus this is gonna be
hopefully maybe 2018 we might see
both of these new new chipsets or chip
families hit the store shelves but we
just don't know we'll have to keep a
close eye on it the point here is that
there are a lot of things going on with
Intel they've sort of slightly like sort
of like sprinkle these crumbs as to
their roadmap for for what they're what
they're releasing in the next year or
two and and yeah we finally have a die
shrink with a new process on 10
nanometer we've been stuck in the the 14
nanometer rut for a while now so and
that's mainly because we've we've seen
challenges right at a certain point it's
it gets significantly harder to to
shrink the die and and to decrease the
the space between the transistors and
that sort of thing doctor you have a dog
and the dog has certain mannerisms and
they just they're funny yes here heroes
so that's all we'll say for now about
cannon Lake a nice lake let's move on to
our last story for today this is a bad
news on Amazon Instant picker instance
having your items ready in just minutes
it's fairly a fairly instant these
Amazon Instant pickup locations will be
localized spaces where you can pick up
daily essentials within minutes of
ordering this includes things like like
a convenience store items like drinks
snacks personal care items phone
chargers little things that are just
convenient that you need on the way to
somewhere whatever you're on a road trip
and this is only to be eligible for
prime and prime student members so if
you're a prime student you know member
from a university or something like that
or if your stoma prime user you will
have access to this new feature these
actual locations kind of like the Amazon
Locker thing but the way it works is
that you place an order and when you
place that order the employees at the
nearest instant pickup location they
know they die every time you buy
something off of Amazon
to pick up an employee dies no one's
gonna die oh I'm sorry to typo that's no
bit far-fetched I'm sorry it was a typo
they gather the items that you ordered
and place them in a self-service locker
and then customers then visit the open
they visit and then open the locker with
like a personalized unique barcode and
then they retrieve their items and then
they're on their way
this is within minutes of ordering
people within that's 20 minutes by the
time you get there it'll already be in a
little locker for you to just take em
again I think that's one of the things
that ready player one that he does like
an automated like you're right it's
unfamiliar we'll see movie he'll
probably be exactly so so I'm imagining
like a dystopian future right we're only
the few people who still have money
money and are able to buy things really
really player 1 those are the only
people left it's the Amazon Prime
members right because Amazon at a
certain point they'll do a purge where
it's like if you don't have enough money
you get kicked out of Amazon Prime
because you know they just have to do
that in order to maintain the service
standards for the people who have enough
money so people with money be able to go
into these stores get to get your basic
needs your goods for for you know
day-to-day life food of course
toiletries yep and everyone else will be
not they'll be locked outside they'll
probably some kind of force field or you
know take Plexiglas to keep them out and
you'll probably have some kind of chip
either like inserted and implanted in
your hand or maybe your eye or possibly
the center of your forehead you scan
that imagine like super poor people like
accidentally like bumping into the
shield and like getting shot a lot of
money it's like think about that look at
automated voices like non-members only
have a nice day yeah I'm glad we have
sustenance indeed so yeah look forward
to that the future future is a trippy
thing man
and one sided me too it's gonna be fun
all excited and terrified all at the
same time let's go on to some donations
yeah ladies John and dick dirt came at 1
2 3 4 to 5 bucks it's about time lol
Volta no no what the no Oh more on that
in my Evans you know Bolton more Voltas
on pulse app weeb $5 post feet I don't
know what that means does that mean like
you want us to post feet pictures of
your fetish and where does that mean
like after feet like post paint then
what it's the post feet period post feet
period artistically we're totally into
wrists now that's the beauty of it don't
know we ant it's ambiguous you're
messing with my mind automatic Matt $5
hey guys watch the line again about four
weeks till I ship out so Paul HTTP see
from me also why are we why are you
removing links on your vids automatic
math thank you for the automatic
donation
yeah I'm removing links on my videos
because I got an email from Amazon that
the links were in violation of the
Amazon affiliate program guidelines
you're not supposed to just just have a
default link to amazon.com which I had
on a lot of my videos it was just like
my amazon link links to Amazon right
you're not supposed to do that they're
supposed to become textual links so
you're supposed to be like here's this
mouse I'm talking about in this video if
you want a link to this mouse it's in
the video description yeah
so amazon emailed me thankfully they're
like you know what we looked at your
channel you're a respectable upstanding
person and we love you for that
so due to that I want to give you this
special chance to actually go in and
remove those rather than just shutting
down your affiliate chant your entire
affiliate account like they do to some
that's what we do with normal people who
suck no I I would buy I was fortunate
that they that they notified me first
but yeah I had to go through every
single one of my videos and just remove
those links from all of them so yeah
yeah still digital Amazon affiliate
links in my videos they're just only the
links for the products in the videos not
just like here's like
yeah okay all right El Jefe reviews
$5.00 Sub Focus heavy finally finally 4x
I'll stay positive shirts cheers yes go
ahead and buy up all the Forex for Excel
stay positives I wasn't even aware that
they were instructing but our t-shirt
guys really on top of it so it's great
I'm gonna email him enjoy the Sherman
even soon enjoy are you gonna call geez
gee whiz guys Scott Dilbeck for the six
dollars and sixty six cents super metal
Paul any progress on the HTTP see Kyle
keep in easy pimpin to use fellas he
could know pimpin absolutely zero
progress it's like when there's there's
like thread Ripper in Vegas yeah zero
program like there's no time five I am
like there's the Camaro declare award
that I got the lovely piece is still
sitting over there and the other room
leaning up against hero's crate I want
to workout it again soon cuz cuz I'm
kinda I want to see how that all plays
out you see how it works out to you it
sounds exciting
I just I wanted to do something that was
kind of different super different I want
to see how that how that happens I'm
gonna make GBC too
you're saying that I just built I'm
gonna test it soon it's not gonna be on
the wall or anything cool like that or
anything special and fun trick the trick
is just to have all the parts just there
yeah that's all and then AMD retweets
you instead like AMD rising tweeted that
video they like follows htpc bills and
I'm like this never like literally is
just part sitting there oh there's
nothing tonight flag a tweet about my
own
all right so let's move on to auto shell
Kowski I don't regret that's a great
last name it really is
ten dollars I run a small computer
repair slash building business and I'm
looking into possibly getting some
review samples any idea who or what I
would look for for contact info for
companies to request some hardware thank
you that's a big challenge it's it's
hard to know really where to go from
from where you're at because I feel like
Paul and I definitely had the privilege
of working at Newegg and like making a
lot of good contacts and meeting some
amazing people in the tech industry who
are at you know like Intel AMD Nvidia
all these big contacts that we sort of
made so I think I think what it comes
down to is like look to yourself first
if there's if there's tech that you have
in your home review that first look look
at what you immediately have as a
resource and try to make it as creative
and and unique as possible it's really
the content not always the product that
can make a big difference and to set you
apart from other channels and then once
you sort of have that established and
you have sort of a reel to showcase for
other vendors then you can reach out and
maybe contact them through you know
sites like Twitter or their Instagram I
know it sounds sort of like you know
kind of like I don't know just sort of
unprofessional whatever but it's it's
2017 there's nothing wrong with
contacting someone through social media
if that's really the best way to get to
them do it right though yeah very my
most companies will have marketing or PR
contact so you can get a hold of just be
professional be able to present them
some of the work you've done yes and
you'll be able to show them some ROI and
you remember they're gonna send you a
product that's worth X amount of dollars
to them yeah they're gonna want to be
able to see some return on their
investment from you exactly in the form
of eyeballs on your video right so that
means that know your role yeah don't ask
for a $4,000 lab if they have a hundred
subscribers ask for a mousepad
maybe start with that you know what I
mean that's that's not a huge investment
like that way there's there's an equal
balance between like everyone wins type
of thing right people aren't gonna go
out on a limb for you in in a business
environment necessarily if it's a mutual
sort of exchange then
have a much higher chance of getting a
product from them
so yes hopefully that makes sense um
Georgia Byrd Kuma's a Dix Akuma's Enix
$10 Kyle from your experience what is
the best 3200 DVR for to use in the 1800
X Rison build my Corsair Ram won't go
past 2666 that's a bummer um I have
really been having good responses with
g.skill hits particularly I've been
using the try bet and Z lineup I haven't
really been using much else at this
point because because tread NZ works and
I don't want to change the formula if
it's already working so he still seems
to have you're really a liability you're
really concerned about compatibility G
skills flare X series is specifically
made for for AMD configurations yes but
make sure you have the latest to Jesus
update update your update the BIOS on
your motherboard that updates the Ajitha
the microcode on the cpu and that can
improve compatibility with certain
memory kits and latest the Jesus update
does have better compatibility with a
lot of different types of memory as well
as different memory configurations
including memory where you have the
memory on the one side versus memory on
both sides the memory yeah I mean get
that update before you even switched Ram
because your course around might be
totally fine with that at ISA update
yeah try it out turn up
jujubee's jujubee's for the 5 dollars
donated on the wrong account last week
my six month X 62 pumps suddenly died on
me do you guys know if NZXT RMA
exchanges are new or or reefer not sure
if their exchanges are new yeah I don't
know I have never gone through that
process stuff they've sent me who's been
new but I can't remember stuff a memory
or so yeah sure not your Luke a from the
10 Australian perhaps g'day lads thanks
Luka day lads love the content it keeps
you busy while I procrastinate at the
office about to click buy on a risin 5
1600 who does RAM speed between 2400 and
3200 make much of a difference or just
go the 24k I would say go for 29 33
minimum yeah the difference between 29
33 and 3200 isn't that
huge 24 you want to get you want to get
right around 3,000 if you can if you get
3000 speed memory it'll often work at 29
33 just fine with the AMD yeah memory
memory dividers indeed dark-dark
Mockingjay from the $7.50 interesting
contribution amount $7.50 three quarters
of $10 he's very financially accurate
love watching you guys I'm working on a
new build right now and was wondering is
the 1700 X worth the extra money over
the 1700 knew if you're willing to
overclock then no yeah if you're
knocking over clock then or I mean if
you're just gonna run the cart them at
Stockton and and there's not much of a
price difference because the 1700 X has
been on some crazy sales if it's 10
bucks difference go for the 1700 X you
run a little bit faster out of the box
at it's like xfr is weird like there's
been different things about it but it is
supposed to be a little bit better XF
our range on the XCX skew processors as
well but yeah if you're just gonna
overclock it and you're you can you can
take a 1,700 to equate the same as what
a 1700 X does yeah freedom freedom money
Aussies new peer do I spend 9000 on a PC
or build one really spend $9,000 on the
PC come on
what don't don't ask you the questions I
mean you already know the answers the
Reg Nick the red check for the $10 don't
need the dementia deck T'Pol twice had
to show you love why thank you right -
Nick I appreciate that what is a good
24/7 OC on horizon 1600 with a be 350
chipset waiting for the second part of
the anyone can OC rise and Paul ah
status sorry you would do a follow I'll
oh oh I know I've been called up whoa I
want to do an advanced resin
overclocking video ideas for it that
I've just not followed up on it all it's
been a crazy I do still have that in my
brain to do so I hope
I will do that 3.9 gigahertz yeah you
43.9 see if you can get four stable but
if you can hit 3.9 like most see most of
the rise in CPUs can do 3.9 all day
without even touching the V Corps yeah
really
no issues yep Giovanni Giovanni aleikum
le I like that name
I'm just lucky I like you my name I like
everything about you $5.00 hey about a
1600 x1 overclocked lovely RGB Kraken X
52 but reviews say the pump fails after
six months your experiences other
suggestions um
when else whenever you have a pump fail
on an all-in-one it sucks and it
tarnishes your opinion of all-in-ones
forever
I've had several pumps fail on all in
ones so it sucks I never have but have
you made a video about yours and you
were like what killed my processor no
that was a leak again it still does it's
the same part of the unit that failed
totally different it's always it could
have been like the same piece coming I
would have been a sealants like not you
know how many states Texas people based
on my my stances I'm gonna say they're
that good
okay can you sit pumps can fail it sucks
most of the companies that are
substantial enough like your NZXT s your
Corsairs
actually have really good policies
because it is so real so rare when it
comes to replacing hardware that might
have been destroyed by a leaky
all-in-one I've heard Corsair as well as
several other companies replace not just
all in one but components that are
destroyed as part of a failure due to
that so yeah it sucks when it happens
but most of the time you do have some
way of getting your stuff back together
if it does so I would say if you love
the RGB kraken x52 go for it you know
they had the X 62 now that it's it's the
same as far as the look those it's just
a different size
yeah radiator I think right yeah
so yeah go for Mei if you can fit the X
X 60 Chism yeah sure
go for that too but yeah it's it's
there's no there's not many other
coolers that have that kind of distinct
look as far as the RGB and everything
yeah also you probably don't need a
super heavy-duty cooler for the 1600 X
yeah just saying even if you're
overclocking
that's also true Libre 1000 oh that's
not a thousand dollar donation that's do
your name Lyra 1000 miles I have an Asus
GTX 1080p I paired with horizon 5 1600
money is not a major factor and I make
videos what a risin 7 or thread Ripper
be better long term well you've already
got the 1080 TI yeah your 1600 only has
six chords you horizon 7 you can get a
thread Ripper with 16 cores but but
you'd have to buy a new motherboard he
says money isn't really a factor yeah
but maybe conveniences but ok yeah if
money's not if I'm just saying if
money's not a factor and go through and
you render lots of videos sure then yeah
going from six core to 1604 6n cores to
16 Xen cores will get you way faster
render times and will save you some time
in the long run true it's not gonna get
you much better gaming performance it's
probably gotta be roughly equivalent
with your 1080 TI but yeah money's not a
factor then you'll you'll render your
 a lot faster I actually found that
the the 7900 X when overclocked
performed better in rendering in W
Premiere Pro than
in overclocks river- of DX did you do a
premier benchmark yes
what did you find same same sort of
thing no no there differ with faster yes
by it's really interesting is a twenty
or thirty percent I think was mercury
playback engine disabled and stuff no I
was rendering with mercury playback
engine and they enabled because I wanted
to render like a normal person and not
like somebody who would turn off
three-quarters of their performance for
some reason well you know it's the same
reason why a lot of us reviewers
including yourself like to test our
video or our CPUs at 1080p even though a
lot of people who are buying thousand
dollar CPUs are never gonna game at that
resolution it's the same sort of thing
all right if I'm being honest I didn't
realize that when you have mercury
playback engine turned off in the
project which is what I did
mercury playback engine can still be
enabled in Adobe Media encoder there's a
separate drop-down for it in the media
didn't realize that had already done my
render and tested hmm and then realized
though I had mercury playback engine
enabled well I guess I'm just gonna roll
me quick you playback enabled for this
test and there's like so many ways to
but that's a valid as long as I did it's
the same on both sides
it's still fine it's like the whole like
okay what's more realistic versus what's
more you know I don't know what you
would call it you know more which
showcased the performance better or
whatever it is
oh yes at any rate I think I agree with
Paul here where you should get a thread
whipper you should get on the thread of
your place or just fun to like if you
have your money for thread Ripper and
your evenings not a factor if you're
vaguely considering yeah I can afford a
thousand dollar processor hey hey you
know what if you're gonna tell us that
money's not a factor in your in your
statements and the donate more than 5
euros alright I'm just gonna I'm just
gonna go out and say something around
the bush here my gonna shave way more
money to the motive 15 $3 there we go
love you guys building a PC for a friend
who has been Mac all his life whoa
that's rough rise in 1600 still trying
to figure out what you
you pairs best with it thanks guys I
wouldn't go beyond a gtx 1070 or a mega
56 so you get your hands on it for cheap
yeah um short story either of those my
Vegas six my Vega 56 opinion is based on
well of course can you buy actually buy
it for 400 bucks and that's a big old
question yeah ii what do you pay for
electricity because if you're in a place
like we are in southern california
that's kind of a bigger factor than if
you're in like canada and you have
hydropower and it's very cheap if
electricity isn't a factor then there
are the vega 56 is a very valuable
option excuse me but you might have an
easier time getting ahold of a 1070 yeah
and i think you can get one first
cheapest about four hundred and thirty
four hundred forty bucks right now on
yeah i was on her new egg yeah in the
u.s. that's marvelous for you i'm Nutkin
fuss but thank you for the $30 a nation
Damona uh
Nutkins bucks five dollars Paul Kyle do
you have any info on nuoc alumni Joanne
tech lover have not seen her in months
anyway here's five bucks for my wife's
IKEA fun yeah freaky Thank You nucking
futs um Jewish she tweets you can tweet
to her and ask her what's up yeah
haven't really kept kept in touch with
her or too closely I don't know what
she's up to these days I mean I know
she's fine I can tell you that she's
alive she's fine well there's nothing
wrong with her or anything at that I
know she hasn't posted anything on our
channel and like half a year or
something like that like I do know some
stuff about her but it's that's like I
just it's not the type of thing I just
want to share cuz I don't yeah it's
summer please it's not like scandalous
or anything it's no it's just personal
information that I just don't want to
share that she's she's fine she's good
yeah and then you know tweet to her and
see if she responds she she posts food
that sheets all the time
Oh David ciao baby child with the $5
rats ones who donate Zuckerberg when the
priests donate after me no there's still
quite a few donations after you leave a
child you got to see thank you for that
one thank you very much sir 37 we should
burn through these all right acquire
five dollars right how thick do you like
your GPU two slots super thick and they
go three of it that's kind of hurts
you're getting greedy at that point
Thomas look in six dollars how about a
duels the unmarked station such as the
HP Zissou 600 versus rise in comparison
pressed performance since old
workstations are dirt cheap that would
be an interesting but kinda nice that's
interest like I feel like I'd be
subjected to what you could get as far
as it duels the atom workstation how do
they run used and how how readily
available those are but you know I mean
maybe yeah interesting
they would probably suffer a little bit
on that on the efficiency side of things
actually
Reggie's pretty efficient it's true
Colton Spears $5.00 follow me I'm a
snake I love snakes
Noorie has this a new snake tuition
dollars how much you think I could sell
a ninety nine or nine ninety FX FX 8350
with 16 gigs ddr3 all together for just
them three parts want to use money for a
be 350 rise to build to 100 maybe 150
bucks yeah yeah
depends on your location yeah 120 go for
120 yeah I'm gonna buy and save between
1 and 150 yeah J ever at $15 Kyle
Holland is still pretty badass with dual
980 T is maybe a water cooling
maintenance video in the future yeah
Paul sound board with Panther sound
anytime arctic panther is mentioned on
awesome hardware that would be nice we'd
love to get a sound board in here we
also like to be able to do the echoey
effect another kind of thing but the
only time we ever think of those things
is like right now mm-hmm
and it'll be gone yep very soon plus I'm
sort of a mixing board myself girl just
does just does the actions that affects
everything
and our final donation for the night for
this half of roberts-davis $5 Paul and
Kyle could a 1080 fit in the mesh if I
see with the radiator on the front with
a fan I know it probably would be a
tight fit
yes you should be fed you should be
totally fine there's plenty of space in
there it's a it's a relatively compact
case yeah but it has full graphics port
graphics card support even if you wanted
to put a radiator in there I believe you
could probably even fit yeah I mean I
don't know if you can you push any any
reasonable normal sized card in the 10.5
11 inch range should be fine yeah
beyond that you might want to double
check but most most 1080s would be
bigger total good you should be good and
the show thing is very much for donation
some quick shout outs to people who have
purchased items from our stores during
the show I just have a couple here one
