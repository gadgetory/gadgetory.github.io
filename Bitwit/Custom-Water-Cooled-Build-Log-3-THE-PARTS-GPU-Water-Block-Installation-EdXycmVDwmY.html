look this other everywhere hey hey hey
honey well at least this thing is silent
stop talking
get out introducing the node 202 from
fractal design it's cool compact and
quiet check the description below for
more details
what's up guys welcome to build log 3 of
my custom liquid-cooled system now in
the first few build logs you guys
obviously saw a lot of custom painting
with the thermal armor on my saber-tooth
x99 motherboard as well as the radiators
that are going to using using the system
but I haven't even told you guys the
full spectrum of hardware that I'll be
using in this system so that's what I'm
going to go over right now if you can
take a look here there it is sitting
nice and pretty so I'm just going to
kind of run through this stuff pretty
quickly because there's a lot to go over
and I don't want to bore you to death so
starting off with some of the stuff that
you already know is in this system is
the define s from Franklin design we've
got the saber-tooth x99 from Asus
beautiful motherboard we've also got a
lot of stuff from ek they've really
hooked me up for this project so
starting off with the pump this is their
d5 pump it's a pump and reservoir combo
as you can see we've also got there a
cool stream PE radiator so we've got a
360 at the top there and a 240 on the
front aided by some fractal design these
are their venturi HP fans these are HP
120 s of course there's going to be
three of them in push at the top and two
more at the front that are also going to
be in push given some nice intake to the
case above that we've also got some
tubing here and a lot of you guys are
asking me are you doing hardline tubing
or are you doing soft tubing well here's
your answer
definitely going soft take that for what
you will
this is e Ches primo chil primo flex
advanced LRT and yeah I could have done
hard line tubing but I figure it's it's
more complicated and since this is my
first time doing a custom build you know
I just assumed that you should probably
learn how to walk first before you start
running so that's I'm going to go with
this and I think even if I had the
choice between hard line acrylic and
soft tubing I just think that the soft
tubing is going to look really nice in
here anyway so wish me luck on that
we've also got some mayhem pastels
perfect pink or Mayhem's pastel perfect
pink fluid I've actually seen Lee from
PC junkie mods uses this in one of his
systems a while back and it looked
really nice so I'm pretty stoked on that
apart from that we've got some more
water cooling hardware here including
two beautiful water blocks for our GPUs
which are the gtx 980ti is of course
right here it says titan x but as most
of you know the pc b--'s like pretty
much the same between the two of them so
ek obviously spent no extra time making
a custom 980ti version they're
completely compatible so those will work
just fine along with some sexy back
plates for our video cards as well got
to have those spray paints I'm going to
get to later we've also got this very
nice ek supremacy Evo water block this
is one of the cleanest looking water
blocks I've ever seen I've always been
attracted attracted to these these types
of water blocks especially the super
supremacy line from ek and I think it's
just going to look absolutely stunning
once it's all in there of course I've
got some ek fittings already attached
we've also got a dual slot terminal to
connect the two GPUs and it is in
parallel I believe so that's going to be
pretty sweet
as far as storage options we've got two
savage SSDs from HyperX or Kingston for
those of you who aren't familiar with
their their hyper X line so I've got a
240 gig up top it's gonna be my boot
drive with some applications editing
software and stuff and then we've got a
960 gig excuse me you got a 960 gig for
pretty much all of the RAW files that
I'm going to be editing with we've also
got three four terabyte WD black hard
drives right here two of which are going
to be in raid one I'm going to be
mirroring these I'm going to be putting
all the awesomesauce archives on it as
well and we've got just a third one just
just because maybe for games and movies
and music and photos and things like
that apart from that we've got an EVGA
supernova
and want p2 sorry for the reflection
hang it over here you can see I'm on my
knees right now wouldn't be the first
time this is going to be just enough
power I think for the two gtx 980 eyes
as well as the 59 60 X which I don't
have shown here it's actually my test
bed right now I'm going to do a little
CPU swap arooo
voodoo magic but that's why it's not
here but I will be using a 59 60 x4 the
system here the two gtx 980 is the first
one the gigabyte is fully referenced
it's got the reference cooler from
nvidia on its just rebranded gigabyte
logo and a sticker has been slapped onto
it but this one's the zotac amp edition
which i recently did a review on you can
go ahead and check that out if you want
but this is fully customized cooler that
works really well and it's super silent
so I'm a little bit bummed
that I'm gonna have to take off the
cooler but I think I'll be okay once I
see how it looks with those beautiful
water blocks installed onto it so that's
that's that and we've got some g.skill
ripjaws for ddr4 memory
this stuff is blazingly fast as 26 66
megahertz 32 gigs is gonna be plenty for
my needs in this case and i think that's
pretty much it apart from the sleeving
so this is a beautiful tee Leo's line
sleeving from mainframe customs if you
guys haven't seen my my custom sleep
tutorial where I teach you how to do
your own extensions go ahead and check
that out it's a really good tutorial and
I in that video I use this exact same
sleeping so you can see kind of what it
looks like when it's done or you can
just sit around for the end product of
this build and you'll also be able to
see what it looks like when it's done um
but here's the deal hmm now this is why
I saved the spray paint for last and
that's because I'm gonna need to edit
some stuff that I originally thought I
would like and now I don't like so much
which is the thermal armor on the
sabre-tooth x99 at first I was like cool
with the fact that it was a really dark
gray and that the radio's radiators were
light gray and that's why I chose these
three colors because you got dark gray
and light gray along with black of
course I was like yeah it'll look fine
with it's all done but I've since then
decided I don't like that and the reason
why is because I think there's just too
much dark gray in one area and there's
too much light gray in another it kind
of divides the case it divides the look
and feel the case I think so what I'm
going to end up doing is going to pop
the thermal
ruff you guys are gonna think I'm crazy
because I am and I'm going to go ahead
and mask off all the black again and I'm
going to sand down all the gray and I'm
going to re spray-paint it with the same
with the same spray spray paint because
member these two are the same came from
the same can both of these shades the
grey you're seeing here I just did way
too many coats my first run on the
thermal armor so now that I'm a bit more
experienced with spray painting I know I
say experience but I've really only just
spray painted these three things but
it's amazing how much you learn from
from doing so little you learned pretty
quickly so I think I'm pretty confident
that the next time around when I go over
this thermal armor I'm going to get a
gray much closer to the radiators and I
think overall that's going to look
really nice of course then that creates
another problem because now I no longer
have a dark need for a dark gray in my
sleeping so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take this fuchsia stuff this
fuchsia fuchsia bright spray paint and
I'm going to try to spray paint some of
the sleeving pink or fuchsia whatever
that way instead of using the dark grey
the the sleeving colors will just be
black light gray and that fuchsia color
that which is going to match the liquid
perfectly I think that will really give
off the look that I've been intending
this whole time for the build and I
think I'm gonna be much happier for it I
know it's going to be a lot of extra
work to do those things painting the
thermal armor and stuff and the sleeping
but I think overall the results are just
gonna be worth it in the end so enough
of me rambling I'm rambling away too
much now so what am I going to be doing
in this video well instead of just
talking my ass off I will actually be
installing these two water blocks onto
these two video cards right now and it's
uh it's it's gonna be fun because I've
never done it before I'm really excited
so cross your fingers everyone cross
your fingers I can see you I can see you
you you right there
you're you're not crossing them and
let's just see how they turn out
you guys ready alright let's do this
you
all right guys so I have hit a snag as
you could probably tell from the
time-lapse I finished installing the GPU
block on the reference card here it is
it's actually very nice fix pretty
speeds kind of dirty it's got some
thermal paste on it but I'll clean that
up soon enough but this this was fairly
easy I did have to remove the the water
block at some point because I forgot to
put some thermal pads on a few of the
regulators but there it is it's looking
all right now then I started moving on
to the zotac card which are the coolers
right here take a look here there it is
the cooler was really easy to remove the
backplate was really easy to remove
but this heatsink that's covering some
of the memory modules as well as a vrm
and whatnot is like glued shut
onto the PCB and I just I tried forcing
it but I don't want to force it too much
obviously because I want to break the
PCB so unless I have a heat gun which I
don't have much experience with I know
you just kind of point at it and and
warm it up but that's also more time and
something I've never done before I think
I'm gonna have to call it quits on the
zotac card I'm gonna have to resign the
zotac card for now put it aside and just
go for the other reference gtx 980ti
that i have the P&amp;amp;Y one and i've already
spent quite a bit of time getting this
one installed i prefer not to spend too
much time on on trying to get this guy
removed so on that note I'm gonna set
this aside like I said and I'm gonna
work on the other reference 980ti
alright folks here they are those two
gtx 980 eyes with their custom water
blocks and back plates fully installed
looking nice looking nice if you guys
have never seen one of these things
custom blocked GPU in person i'll tell
you right now the video never does
justice
they are just super sexy and i think
they look pretty damn good in my system
so far if you are curious about doing
this yourself there are a couple things
to keep in mind and i guess this is
where i should quickly transition into
the things that i learned in this
process the first one being that's
putting a custom block on your GPU is
not difficult if you think it's hard and
it's intimidating you shouldn't be
scared it's kind of like when i first
built my computer for the first time
ever the first one I ever did I was
pretty worried that I would mess it up
and I was like whoa so like this is out
of my league type of thing but it's not
really like that
and the same thing goes for for
something like this it does however take
a lot of time and patience to get it
right and you know you never want to
rush this sort of thing that being said
I did run into a few snags which also
was a good learning experience for me if
you are going to do this for the first
time anyway and you're not too
experienced like myself I would suggest
trying to work with a reference GPU
first just because there's fewer
surprises I guess like the the instance
that I ran into with the zotac amp 980ti
where I just couldn't get that damn
heatsink off I wasn't expecting that and
thank God I had a another reference
980ti lying around I was able to use
that but that's just another thing I
would say unless you've done extensive
research on that particular model of non
reference card and you see that it's
really easy and simple to take the
cooler completely off and mount a your
own custom one I would suggest going
with a non reference I'm sorry a
reference video card when doing
something like this another thing this
is probably more specific but tweezers
no one ever told me to use tweezers and
I'm sure there's videos out there that
do tell you to use tweezers but tweezers
came in handy so much in this this whole
experience just because
I could not get the thermal pads on
correctly or I couldn't get them on
straight or properly with my fat nubby
fingers having those precision nosed
tweezers the high quality ones were
really helpful just being able to lift
them off of the little adhesive pad they
come on and stick them right onto the
whatever it was the memory chips and
what-have-you
was really helpful so I would highly
suggest getting some tweezers before you
take on a test like this as well also a
little screw tray magnetic screw tray
you guys might have seen that in the
time-lapse pick one up on Amazon or
wherever for next to nothing and it's
really helpful in this kind of situation
because you're dealing with a lot of
little screws and you don't want to get
them lost so even having maybe a couple
of them having one or two might be
helpful because you can kind of divide
them up evenly between whatever cards
that you're using or based on wherever
they go and I think the last thing is
that's it I think those are all the
things so um stay tuned for the next
bill blog hopefully you guys enjoyed
this one toss me a like on if you liked
it if not tell me why in the comments
but build log for get this look at this
look at this guys these are the last
fittings that I was waiting for in the
mail and they just came yesterday so you
know that means that means in the next
build log we might build this thing I
want to say we're going to because I
still have some stuff to do I still need
to paint the thermal armor repaint the
thermal armor and I might even do some
other custom modding slight custom
modifications that I'm going to keep a
secret for now
but this means that we are now right I
am now ready to build this thing as soon
as those other things happen there's a
very specific order these things need to
have operate in but we're getting really
close we're getting super close and I'm
really excited thank you guys so much
for joining me along on this amazing
journey it's been super fun I can't wait
to build my second one and now having
the experience that I do build in this
first one so thanks for staying tuned
guys I'll see you next time in the next
