guys Kyle with big wood here today's
video is gonna be quick and dirty
because I have a lot on my plate this
week before I hop on a plane to Taiwan
for copy tex things are crazy right now
so I'm sort of consolidating to
benchmark videos into one lucky you and
today we're actually gonna be taking a
look at the benchmarks for April's PC of
the month which is the ultimate airflow
PC instead of the cooler master h 500 p
mesh and the may PC of the month which
is the purple risin bill this one
doesn't really have a cool name like
this one but this is inside of the
fractal design mesh if I see in white
both very lovely systems and they're
actually very similarly expect as well
both have an AMD rise in 720 700 X and a
gtx 10a BTI albeit from different camps
EVGA msi and 16 gigs of DDR 4 at 3400
speed this one's actually rocking at 32
hundred megahertz kit but I overclocked
it slightly to 3400 to match the kit in
this system just so we have even more of
an apples-to-apples comparison so truth
be told this is probably not gonna be
the most exciting showdown ever because
the core specs are so similar and any
difference in gaming performance or
thermals is likely gonna boil down to
things like the adding board partner for
the video cards
I believe the EVGA card is clocked maybe
10 to 15 megahertz faster than the MSI
one out of the box and other things like
the cases and the cooling solutions this
has got the big ass not to an air cooler
of the NHD 15 idle number and a deep
cool captain 240 X RGB liquid AO in this
corner so that pretty much sums it up
guys but without further ado let's go
ahead and waste no more time and dive
right into the benchmarks
so unsurprisingly these systems
performed very similarly with the mesh
fic built actually performing a little
bit better and I think again that's
probably because of the slightly higher
factory overclock on its 1080p I as I
mentioned before and then the thermals I
mean the GPO thermals are very similar
only a degree off or so but 2,700 X was
about 8 degrees cooler on its package in
the mesh if I see than it was in the H
500 P mesh which is quite interesting I
was actually expecting the not to a
cooler to give the deep cool AO a run
for its money being such a well renowned
air cooler and stuff but clearly I was
wrong and significantly underestimated
the cooling potential of the deep cooled
capitan 240 X RGB and the mesh rafi
I also wonder if the little modification
that I made to the front panel where I
cut out the plastic piece that I could
house the two fans on the outside of the
frame made much of a difference there
I'm not sure maybe that warrants further
testing I don't know but at any rate
liquid has clearly trumped air this time
around but on that note guys I think I'm
gonna cut things off here like I said I
have a ton more stuff to do before I hop
on a plane in just a few days so yeah
thank you guys so much for watching cost
like on the video if you enjoyed it and
get subscribed for more tech stuff
coming at your really soon guys thanks
for watching have yourselves a good one
and I'll see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
