brought to you by fantex berta gear
enter max be quiet and cable mod you can
learn more about their products and the
links below what's going on guys right
now I am at the Corsair suite here at
Computex 2018 and I just kind of
wandered over to the first thing that
caught my eye literally which was all of
these LED modules RGB LED modules this
is their step-up now from the original
Vengeance RGB this is their vengeance
RGB Pro line of ddr4 memory ranges
anywhere from 20 666 speed all the way
up to 4000 however in July I believe
they're gonna release ink its that go
even beyond that speed so they're really
pushing the boundaries here and I
believe don't quote me on this but I
believe they're also rockin some Samsung
B dies so that's fantastic great for
overclocking you can see here that
they've actually kind of stepped up
their game when it comes to the amount
of illumination that happens on the
front of their dims and there's no
branding on the front it's just a really
clean like you wouldn't even know that
these are Corsair sticks unless you look
to the side so they're really just sort
of prioritizing and focusing on the
illumination aspect and I got to say
they're incredibly bright these are
probably some of the brightest RGB dims
that I've seen yet definitely brighter
than like even tried NZ RGB stuff so
they look fantastic
they're fast and hopefully reliable I'll
probably get some of these in a build
sooner than later now obviously these
sticks can be controlled through the IQ
software which is also brand-new and
just had its full launch just earlier
this Monday so it can be integrated and
can sync up with other corsair
compatible components and other
peripherals so that's really cool
additionally there's 10 LEDs per stick
so you have a very nice sort of smooth
and seamless gradients going across the
entire module which looks very nice
according to the spec sheet here it
looks like you can opt for either a 2 by
8 gig stick kit all the way up to 8 by
16 gigs so really your pick of the
litter depending on your budget and
needs and in terms of performance over
here we have a brand new micro ATX case
from Corsair they actually haven't
released a new micro ATX chassis in
years I can't even remember the last one
although maybe it was that was that the
air 2 for it doesn't matter
the successor to the heir to 40 a very
popular micro ATX case this is the 280x
RGB there's also a non RGB model if
you're not into lighting that goes for
50 dollars cheaper that's 109 for the
non RGB and 159 for the RGB model you
can see that the exterior is still very
boxy in shape which which I like and it
also gets a tempered glass treatment
there's sort of a floating tempered
glass piece of the front here this
actual piece of glass is not removable
but of course you could just pop off the
entire front panel if you wanted to you
get two USB three at the top mic and
headphone jacks with the power button
and reset there's also tempered glass on
the top with another separate panel
that's got it looks like allen keys
right here for the four screws but I
believe that's going to be changed over
to a Phillips head for the u.s. the
final retail model and then we also have
a tempered glass side panel right here
and obviously it's going to be the same
sort of dual chamber design where you've
got the power supply and drives on one
side where you can stash excess cabling
and then you've got sort of your beauty
side on over here you can see here
they've got sort of an SLI configuration
with their new ddr4 RGB memory we just
took a look at plenty of nice grand
grommeted holes for for routing cables I
can see at least one big one there there
might be just some cutouts at the top as
far as radiators go now you get a 240 at
the front 280 at the top and there's
even an option for a 280 at the floor of
the case assuming that you're sticking a
mini ITX motherboard in here and that
definitely open opens up a couple more
options looks like there's a ton of
airflow going through right now I'm not
exactly sure what the temps are or
anything or if it's even under load in
the first place
but it looks like you even definitely
stash a load of full-sized hardware
inside of this chassis another important
thing to mention about that $50 price
difference is that you're also getting
two of the ll series RGB fans included
as well as a lighting note Pro just to
make everything look all nice and showy
as for the Corsair booth that's gonna do
it for now guys but let me know what you
thought of that memory as well as that
case are you a fan I don't need right
guys thanks for watching go ahead and
follow me so you don't miss any more
stuff coming here at a Computex 2018 and
i'll see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
