channel hope you're all doing well so a
couple weeks back if you guys remember
wifey sauce and I got together and
curated a list for a $400 gaming PC on
amazon.com and shortly after that we
bottle the parts and I actually had
wifey sauce assembled the PC all on her
own I'm very proud of her and we ran
some tests on this 400 dollar system
while it's not going to give you the
highest end experience when it comes to
gaming it sure is a great way to get
your foot in the door when it comes to
PC gaming if you don't have the money to
throw down on a mid-range to high-end
system the target resolution and sort of
experience that we're going for today is
1080p 60fps and I think for most people
that's a comfortable experience
especially given the price point of
today's rig so why don't we go ahead and
check it out let me grab the camera
right here and show off the exterior of
the system first off with the chassis
now this is not the case that we
initially picked out in the part 1 video
which you can go ahead and check out in
the cards the initial case that we found
was like a beige box that looked like it
was about a hundred years old but then
we found this ol√° vetti not exactly
sure what the model number is off the
top of my head but I'll leave links to
all these parts in the description below
guys if you want to check that out
but it's a fantastic little case for
about 35 bucks I think we paid for it
and it did include a power supply which
is generally not the best sign but when
you're talking about a $400 gaming PC
that's exactly what we were looking for
it's actually not a bad looking case for
the price I mean you've got some nice
LED action here blue power button and
some backlit red logo right there got
these nice little hidden flaps you got
two USB two and your audio and mic I
know no USB three it's quite a sin but
again
for two bucks guys 400 bucks but it is a
very light case it's got it's got sort
of these feet that are that are sort of
angled it makes the case look like it's
sort of at a slant which is not my
favorite but you know I do like the fact
that there's some ventilation on the
side panel here just a little bit by the
graphics card let's go ahead and pop
this guy off and see how wifey sauce did
on her first ever unsupervised PC build
look at that she did a fantastic job
with cable management I mean with what
she had to work with which was this
crappy little case and you know bad
power supply with just these awful
cables look at this thing I don't think
I could have done a better job with this
myself she did a really nice job
actually take a look at the back the
back she even more impressive look at
she did this she did all this cable
management I didn't tell her to to use
zip ties or to use these the tie-down
points she just did a fantastic job very
proud of her I think I'm gonna have her
build everything from now on I hope
she's cool with that but let's dive into
some of the tech specs here starting
with our CPU which is the Intel G 45 60
dual-core processor at a fixed 3.5
gigahertz this is a lock CPU so we're
running at that clock speed for the
entirety of today's tests we've also got
a beautiful motherboard from gigabyte
this is the H this H 110 M MDOT - I
think but for memory we've got eight
gigs we got two four gig sticks now
initially I was good I was just gonna
run with one a single a single four gig
stick thinking that I could scrape by
I'm so glad that I went with a dual
channel kit giving us eight gigs in
total of this not course they're crucial
memory just because there are so many
games these days that will max that out
so very glad that we went that out that
route look at this and how many $400
gaming pcs can you say has an m2 SSD
just chill in there in the motherboard
slot not many but unfortunately it's not
an nvme that would have taken a miracle
to pull off still 128 gig for a boot
drive SATA based m2 SSD from electronics
probably a Chinese awayin brand I've
never heard of but but there you go this
thing boots in twenty four seconds guys
400 RPC booting in 24 seconds and well
it would have been super cool to get a
250 gig in there it just was not working
for our budget but at least 128 gives us
plenty of room for the operating system
and a few minor programs can't forget
about mass storage though so we've got a
one terabyte WD caveat green which was
already formatted and stuff lenin was
named BB when I first got this was sold
to me as new but it's clearly used and
has been has been funneled with in the
past and I don't like that makes me feel
uncomfortable and we've got our graphics
card here gtx 10:50 from msi this is not
a TI now I did overclock this guy we put
a 100 megahertz offset on the core clock
300 megahertz offset on the memory clock
I believe we were boosting
on the core clock up to about 1700 and
84 megahertz if I remember correctly and
our memory clock speed was just over
1900 now one of the great things about
entry-level budget oriented gaming PC's
is that they typically don't get very
hot or loud and this system right here
is no exception
we were only seeing about 50 degrees C
on our G 45 60 here which is fantastic
because those cooler temperatures means
that the fan on the CPU cooler here the
stock cooler from Intel does not have to
spin up as fast and so the system stays
very very quiet as Elmer Fudd would say
we've also got decent thermals on the
graphics card not heating up more than
68 69 degrees Celsius at any given time
under load which is super fantastic
overall this is a quiet and cool running
system but is it a well performing one I
ran six different titles at 1920 by 1080
and this was of course using the latest
wiffle driver from Nvidia which I will
pop up right there now as you go about
viewing the benchmarks guys be sure to
keep in mind what quality settings we
were running for each game because it
does change from game to game based on
what the system is able to handle but
for the most part we were able to run
most titles at high settings no problem
so on that note without further ado
ladies and gentlemen here are the
performance marks for our $400 Amazon
gaming PC
alright so there you guys have it what
do you guys think of these results I'm
very curious to hear your thoughts 400
dollars with a forty dollar system this
is about the price of a modern-day
console but I feel like the experience
is a bit richer and it's it's a
full-blown PC so there's just so much
more that you can do with it in general
but I don't know would you call this a
console killer I didn't put it in the
title or anything because I didn't
really have that in mind when I went
into this video but would you consider
this a console killer with the with the
performance that we're seeing today and
honestly the performance is is great I
mean we're seeing well above 60 fps in
certain games that are pretty easy to
run like overwatch and csgo I'm sure
like dota 2 and stuff like that would
also do really well League of Legends
and that sort of thing and then even
even the more demanding titles at high
settings we're seeing around 60 FPS on
average 1% lows we're all above 30 FPS
with 0.1% lows just sometimes I think in
one or two games like pub G which isn't
very well optimised in the first place
we're seeing below 30 FPS with 0.1% lows
but for the most part average frame
rates and frame times we're looking
pretty solid again for $40 guys let me
know what you think of this PC in the
comments below that is gonna do it for
now guys be sure to toss me a look on
the video if you enjoyed it you can also
check out bit wit ultra my ad-free early
