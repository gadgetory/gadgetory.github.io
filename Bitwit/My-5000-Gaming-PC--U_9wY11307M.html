what what the hell are you doing here oh
yeah just in the area so I thought I'd
dropped in see how you're likely No - OH
- dude how the hell did you get in here
bathroom window was open so I just
crawled in through there breezy by the
way your a/c was like not even on man it
is hot your Ida crank that you strips
are pretty good getting out that one do
you know that you only have basic cable
like a basic basic so did we launch a
Netflix not everything belongs in your
living room for a quiet and compact
companion check out the node 2 oh 2 from
fractal design you can find more info in
the description below was it guys so in
late June of this year I began working
on my very first custom water-cooled
build the next two months were filled
with countless hours of painting
sleeving bending and assembling a high
end machine capable of smooth 4k gaming
at high settings the end result was hot
line a retro powerhouse sporting a 59 60
X 16 gigs of DDR 4 and 2 gtx 980ti s in
sli and while the spec sheet alone
implied some extraordinary potential I
wouldn't be fully satisfied until I had
hard evidence of its 4k capabilities so
today I'll be benchmarking hot line for
the first time to see what kind of
gaming performance one can expect from
this $5000 water-cooled behemoth before
we dive right into the benchmarks though
let's first take a look at the system's
thermals and acoustics as both our areas
which should benefit greatly from custom
liquid cooling at idle we saw the CPU
float at around 19 degrees Celsius with
the hottest core at 22 a whole degree
colder than a Benny's or Scrooged under
a typical gaming workload the 59 60 X
jumped up to 51 degrees and with
balls-to-the-wall stress testing in
prime95 the hottest core on our 8 core
chip maxed out at 82 degrees Celsius
with the average temp for all cores
hitting a very respectable 73 degrees
our gtx 980ti is idled at a frigid 36
degrees Celsius and max out at 51
degrees Celsius when gaming on a stable
overclock it should be noted here that
the top card runs slightly
warmer since the liquid cooling passing
through it incur some additional heat
after first permeating the bottom card
still these results fall right in line
with my expectations from a custom loop
such as this one making me one hell of a
happy camper what's more is that the
system is able to achieve these superb
thermal conditions while staying
insanely quiet have a listen at the idle
and load acoustics using the standard
fan mode in AI suite 3
as you could hear or not hear this rig
is near dead silent with almost no
audible difference between idling and
gameplay I even had a hard time picking
out any fan noise over the sound of the
hard drive spinning platter surely an
honorable mention goes to fractal design
in this area for their venturi high
pressure fans which stay whisper quiet
without sacrificing much of their
cooling capacity so now that we've
talked thermals and acoustics let's make
our way over to the system's gaming
performance starting with our testing
setup the 59 60 X was pushed to 40 400
megahertz at 1.3 volts and I was able to
overclock the gtx 980ti x' to a whopping
14 hundred and 80 megahertz with the
memory clock receiving a more modest
boost of 50 megahertz all tests were run
using the latest 350 5.8 - wickel driver
on Windows 8.1 the system underwent
testing in five different triple-a
titles at max settings with the
exception of having MS a a disabled as
many would argue that its quality
improvement is hardly noticeable at the
higher pixel count of 4k this makes its
usage tough to justify given its heavy
tax on system resources which is why
I've left it on the sidelines for the
series of tests all right ladies and
gentlemen I now present to you the
moment we've all been waiting for so dim
the lights grab some popcorn and let's
check out all the 4k benchmarks for
hotline starting with Metro last light
we see crushing performance at 1080 and
1440 with average frame rates in the
triple digits it takes jumping up to 4k
to see our average finally sink below
100 but still the 980ti is managed a
very playable 78 FPS in hitman
absolution we ran into some CPU
bottlenecking
a conclusion we can quickly draw from
near-identical frame rates across the
various resolutions being tested even at
4k the GPUs aren't being stressed enough
for our overclocked 59 60 X to keep pace
which is quite a testament to the
horsepower of our sli setup by the way
did I mention we're still hitting over
100 FPS on average at 4k
gta5 presents yet another example of cpu
bottlenecking but this case varies
slightly in that we see a noticeable
performance hit when moving to 4k
indicating the 59 60 X has finally
caught up with the 980 T is since
they're now far too busy rendering those
extra pixels in battlefield 4 we saw 200
FPS on average at 1080 no big deal
165 FPS at 2k and 78 frames per second
at Ultra HD
I'm also rather amused that our minimum
frame rate at 4k landed above 60 fps it
just gives me a warm fuzzy feeling
inside that makes me giggle naturally I
thought it would be appropriate to save
the most demanding game for last
even with hotlines arsenal of souped-up
hardware Crysis 3 gives it a run for its
money averaging 54 fps and 4k
while this is still quite playable until
I acquire a g-sync monitor I'll probably
stick with playing this game at 14:40
where the screen tearing isn't as
noticeable ah Who am I kidding
I only own this game for benchmarking
rounding out our benchmarks I ran 3d
mark firestrike ultra because I could
and earned a ridiculous score of 8000
271 graphics test once on average FPS of
54 with test 2 coming in at 33 FPS I'd
also like to point out that this was the
first time I've ever seen this test run
where it didn't look like a bloody flip
book and those are all the benchmarks
overall I am incredibly pleased with the
final results which have reassured me
now that this PC will serve me well for
my venture into 4k gaming I'm also
curious to know what you guys think of
the performance here do the benefits of
custom liquid cooling warrant the
additional cost
when will we be finally ready for 4k
tacos go ahead and leave your thoughts
in the comments and don't forget to toss
me a like on this video if you enjoyed
it also don't forget this is your last
chance to enter the epic give away with
