is all Christmas fall today give some
c-span's your greeting very fixed yeah
you didn't tell me that they impede my
ability to get sure trying to be one of
my next investments as I want to
they're super handy some better lights
and yeah the actual C stands that don't
oh yeah you've got a hair light up there
yeah this is all Chris's doing I don't
know I was like my hair like my hair is
fine those cares about my hair he's like
look at the definition you can see in
our shoulders because of the heirloom
and it lights sort of the back of the
set so it's not just all dark and dim
now yeah so pleasant okay
people people are probably very
impressed with the visual aesthetic they
probably aren't until they go back like
three or four episodes before Chris came
in like reason all like oh my god what
what German dungeon are you in doing a
German dungeon pawn say what all right I
think I think we might be live for the
shares to both platforms and what a
beautiful way started off welcome guys
to awesome hardware episode 125 yes it's
not our first rodeo but it sure as hell
seems like and welcome to the best tech
show on the internets we are doing this
show we stream this show every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right
here and twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware we also stream to our
respective YouTube channels one part at
a time today we actually stream to
Paul's channel first which is
youtube.com slash Paul's hardware you
can go ahead and check that out in the
link in the description below if you're
watching us on YouTube and we are here
now at youtube.com slash teach last bit
live which is my youtube channel so we
tend to like to have we tend to have
lots of fun on this show we drink an
adult beverage here and there as we're
doing now sponsored by Anchor Steam
actually not sponsored we're just
drinking it cheers to all of you who
might be drinking at home even if it's
water yes it's cool with us sometimes
every once in a while we will yell out
the occasional and so if you have
sensitive virgin ears then you might
want to be aware of that sorry in
advance to any headphone users who might
be hurting right now we are gonna do our
best to minimize that with the use of
these a stress because you turned your
compressor I did turn my compressor on
Kyle's cattle son
well now beacon which he bought with
much forth forethought did a lot of
Investigation and comparisons between
different models
oh yes inspector discovered it also has
a single knob compressor on there so
trying to trying to use that
functionality so that wouldn't we happen
to raise our voices perhaps headphone
users don't want all those Oh although I
still feel inadequate because my
soundboard doesn't have the voice
changing preset mixers those are like
yours does does our fun we're gonna try
to take advantage of those alright when
I went to your house last week and I saw
that yours had like all of all those
those presets
it reminded me of the scene in American
Psycho when Christian Bale's looking at
looking at all the other people persons
business guys as card skirts ago month
laminated in the finest coat of Sheen or
a bit of a boiling with anger
thank you guys so much for joining our
little show here we also are selling
merchandise on both of our stores you
can find them - bit wit tech slash store
you can also find the link in the
description our beautiful moderator cell
processing is also posting that in chat
we've got some cool merchandise actually
we're doing a design contest a t-shirt
design contest you guys are free to
enter it's still going on this is one of
the winners so far the RGB everything
shirt is one of my personal favorites
like it it is just super original and
really well executed
you can buy any of the awesome Hardware
shirts with both Paul and I from either
of our stores and we'll be splitting the
profits evenly so it really doesn't
matter who you buy from awesome Hardware
show you some hardware from Brian Brian
design the amazing sword fight somewhere
around the back amazing sword fight
shirt from Brian or maroc suit you guys
are all doing a fantastic job with your
submissions wifey sauce has been going
through all of them and really we've
been liking a lot so you guys are free
to purchase anything on this site
there's lots of stuff there's also
things on Paul's site which is Paul's
hardware dotnet
what do you got Paul you got your bottle
openers those are new of course we have
some hardware stuff bottle openers just
added these these are serious metal
laser cut
the etched logo here's one right here
Kyle has definitely doesn't have v4
similar bottle openers bartender style
bottle opener very similar yeah that's
available you can get into set with the
with the pint glasses as well yes so
super nice and also of course all the
shirts and other merchants and stuff so
thanks to all you guys who support us on
the show little shout out Johnson at you
at the end of the show if you buy stuff
that's we will ladies gentlemen also if
you guys happen to be donating in chat
with super chet on youtube then we will
rest assured we will be getting to all
of the comments you attached to those
donations at the end of this half of the
show without said we can move on to our
tech news for the hour which is starting
with this article from actually some an
article it's just the manufacturer page
from ezra calm this is actually
highlighting the only the first and
perhaps the only mini ITX
x $2.99 motherboard we may ever see
well that ladies gentleman as rock is at
it again with their ridiculously small
form factor but super high end desktop
platform motherboards as they did with
XX 99 back in the dirt that's that's got
a dual 1.2 it's got a triple m dot two
slots there isaac there are hardly you
know premium ATX boards that have triple
m dot two slots on them additionally
they've been in collaboration with bits
power to create a custom water block
actually that's pretty cool it's pretty
friggin badass that's like that's like
part of it to be see-through maybe but
yeah i wouldn't be surprised if EK did
something with them too but it looks
pretty bad i mean it almost takes up the
entire span of the board yeah but it's
just thank you imagine they have a ton
of room for vrm cooling on this thing
like yeah it's all right here right next
to a daughter board right so yeah that's
the one thing because I feel like they
nailed a lot down if you notice there's
four s o DIMM slots on the board so it
actually supports quad-channel memory I
like that I mean I'm not great that was
one of the drawbacks of their ex I know
exactly like a dual-channel
yeah so it's just a matter
well how well does this thing overclock
if you are wanting to you know put them
a lot chip in there and have your way
with it with that vrm might be a little
bit limited but everything else seems
pretty good plenty of storage so there
is a heatsink it's kind of tucked away
back here oh yeah we better heat sink
there's probably some mods that you can
do for that as well I mean it is
featuring AC Wi-Fi right built-in it's
gooey 3.1 gen2 title gigabit in tirana
as rack know ten gigabit ethernet on
here the hell everyone's doing it that's
an RGB header well it looks like an RGB
header I think right here
yeah that's yeah that's definitely with
that srgb
yep can't sacrifice that No so pretty
impressive for a mini ITX port the price
tag however is not immediately appealing
399 dollars for bucks I don't think I've
ever seen the Mini ITX board go for that
much no ever no and I never have would
be hard-pressed to save more than 300
for a minute
oh yeah words that I've seen right okay
so umm I don't know how much they're
excited you pay a pretty very hefty
premium for this board however there is
no other board like it on the market so
take it for what it is I suppose I would
love to do a build with this I'm a man
fanatic I would love to build a system
with this board the x99 - ii ITX there
x99 variants of this right still sells
for $250 on nuoc and that one comes with
a cooler a CPU cooler yes right just
just play that out right the cooler I
don't know as much testing been done on
it's like an adequate cooler it's it's
there it's there ostensibly because they
had to modify the actual actual mounts
yo standard LGA 2011 - three it was like
semi proprietary
yeah coolers wouldn't fit on it so that
was their like alright well here you get
a cooler so you can use this but there
were other there was also a bracket that
came with it so you can adapt it for
mm-hmm yeah the bits power water block
that we feet that we showed you earlier
that is definitely sold separately does
not come included with that before nor
pay for for under but like charge 500
for it and it comes with the water block
and I bet they get some Yonkers yeah I
don't think so yeah it's pretty sweet
it's it's just crazy they 4s of DIMM
slots that's a first for me I don't
think I've ever seen that on a board
before Mini ITX board they said enough
and not enough fan headers how many of
them I don't know that's the deal
breaker for Paul no there's only three
fans I could have had more they're gonna
ban anti-fan hub like great alright I
don't use the audio down here I believe
this I was molested by splitter whatever
front panel headers this is probably
front panel headers I'm not seeing a USB
2 header but let's see others look like
a USB 3 header let's the other thing is
the lay it is so close like like some
thicker plugs for for the 24 pin next to
the very friend excellent ESP 3 which
also often has a big old bulky like kind
of mass yeah that's part of the cable is
very tough right against this
daughterboard the too close for comfort
that'd be tight I know no I'm interested
to see some you dip the zip tie the two
together so that I don't know one
wouldn't I don't know surprise there's
probably it's gonna be kind of wedged in
there and kind of pushing each other
apart yeah but it's it's tight it's
definitely a definitely a little bit a
little bit cramped in there but what do
you expect I guess all things considered
but our next article is also built a
piece of hardware that seems fairly
innovative this is the Microsoft Surface
book - oh hold on sorry someone put in
this out in chat so I wanted to point
out here that USB 3 is actually raised
it's part of the daughter board okay
that's up there alright for that thank
you chat person who
oh yeah interesting I have not really
seen a raised usb3 head or either yeah
but I mean it does provide a little bit
more space around there so yeah no good
I chat good I alright next we're talking
about the Microsoft Surface book - now
it has been about two years I think
since the original surface book released
so a lot of people were speculating that
there would never be a follow-up to the
initial launch but here we have surface
book number two in the flesh and it's
exciting even though it's a piece of
mobile tech which we typically don't get
as a fangirl over compared to like
actual silicon in terms of CPU or GPU
what's exciting about this is that it
can actually do some pretty decent
gaming we've got a 15 inch model now
with cable 8 core 4 CPUs yes we're on an
older 8th gen but it's hardly older in
fact it would still be new if Intel
didn't rush their copulate launch oh
yeah seventh gen sorry but additionally
we've got a discreet GTX 1060 GTX 1060
okay in the 15 inch model which is good
I mean we were all super stoked when
razor announced their blade shipping
with the same GPU inside of inside of
that device and so this is pretty
exciting as well initially I thought
this is just gonna be another sort of
ultrabook look-alike type of thing but
it looks like we can actually pack in
some decent performance we've got a 4k
screen 3840 by 2160 on 15 inches that's
gonna look very sharp you know
no pixelation with like small large
texts and things like that it's supposed
to have a lot a longer battery life
which was one of the probably be
Achilles heel of the first surface book
I think a hot hardware or I'm sorry
TechRadar who tested this noted probably
like a sub 4 hour battery life on the
original surface book which is pretty
terrible
this one is promising much longer than
that with five hours in tablet mode 17
hours when docked
time will tell if that's actually
accurate Microsoft is claiming that this
surface book is twice as powerful as
Apple's latest MacBook Pro which I would
imagine they're probably pulling from
the graphics scores or the graphics
benchmarks because of the scree GTX 1060
if you compare that to the MacBook Pro
which has like some mobile based Radeon
pro graphics I think which are not not
quite up to snuff it sounds super
powerful but I'm sure the MacBook Pros
just as expensive if not more so of
course this is going to be retailing at
least for the 15 inch model they're
about starting at $1,500 MSRP and that
that's USD that'll scale up depending on
how much NAND flash storage you wish to
go with you can either get your ticket
of 256 512 or one terabyte of internal
NAND flash storage for the Ness SD there
um let's see what else we got here it's
gonna ship with a core i7
8650 you a mobile KB Lake processor I do
not know much about to be honest and 16
gigs of memory alright you know it's
also also kind of cool here is that it
chips with a built-in Xbox one
controller receiver oh so that if you
did want to like play games or whatever
with a controller let's say you're on an
airplane or something which I have done
in the past you don't need to connect a
dongle that's you don't need to plug in
a dongle for to use your xbox controller
that's cool
I think that's pretty cool I think more
laptops should start doing that just
because the dongle is really
inconvenient when you are using a laptop
just having that thing just sprawled out
and stuff makes things in convinced a
nice it's a nice pitch for using it for
a multi-purpose for like you know take
it on the road with you for gaming and
getting work done and all that stuff
yeah definitely so be on the lookout for
that it is available I do not know when
Oh November 16th it will be launching
November 16th yeah oh just a month time
I take notes it sure is oh that's useful
month in a day all right next up we've
got some this is this might as well be a
hot and heavy hardware Segway
because we ready we're talking all about
the hardware and this will news things
pitch but that's fine I'm sure you guys
don't mind we've got a gtx 1070 TI
gaming from good old gigabytes that has
been fully pictured and laid out for us
via video cards come this is a very
familiar design if you guys will recall
it is predating to the g1 gaming series
that gigabyte is known for this is
before the Auris era okay and this is
one of my favorite designs for a video
card ever because it was yeah because it
was just it was very solidly built I
felt like there was a like 900 series
this is like United to say he's had a
metal shroud it was all black is all
black yes does the orange accents is
slightly different you know you could
but you could paint over those if you
really wanted to yeah the backplate
definitely looks like the the 900 series
not quite as bad of course I still feel
like they peaked with that within things
with the 980 IX 980 I think 1 980 the
980 I was a little bit bigger and had
silver accents on it let me see if I can
find it they keep time so basically what
we're talking with you talking about
here is if you look from the if you look
at the pictures we're actually dealing
with a shorter PCB from the 1070 ti then
we are on the on the original gtx 1070
there's also a new heatsink design which
is that it I found it hold on say going
back to what you're talking about this
is the also a single 8 pin header which
is nice ok same as the is gtx 1070
reference is a pin or 6 pin believe it's
single 6 pin but i've i think it's a 6
pin - I think it's a 6 pin and then GTX
1080 is it is it an 8 pin I think you're
right
that's my that's my gut instinct but
additionally there's a fan stop icon
which indicates that it does have 0 rpm
operation under level 70 is also an 8
Oh 1070 is also an 8-pin sorry excuse me
I apologize since so then a 1080 is an 8
pin and a 6 pin perhaps or just another
8 pin I'm not sure 1080 is also just an
8 pin okay that I remember alright so
basically we've got although of course
aftermarket versions you know yeah of
course but it's kind of interesting to
see an aftermarket card as you were just
mentioning Paul with a single late pin
that's kind of cool hmm
triple fan design looks like a fairly
semi-open shroud so it might be ejecting
some hot air into your case but also
some at the back as he mentioned as well
there's some orange accents on the
bottom of the card which I'm not a huge
fan of obviously yes that is the bottom
huh yeah I mean let's consider the back
plate to be the bottom but I guess
that'd be more the top user I always go
based on just what it looks like in a
regular case yeah so that's usually the
bottom to me in most systems I've built
so the back plate looks pretty clean
minimalistic the side doesn't look too
gaudy or anything like that like their
extreme series cards which I'm not a
huge fan of personally but but alright
it's a pretty pretty clean looking card
overall I'd like them to just make these
orange accents black but yeah
easy spray paint job if you wanted to
here's the 90 post here's a 980 yeah
yeah those cards those those are some of
my favorite this is a all-metal Olmedo
yeah simple black design depending on
which version of this you got they had a
version of this that was the higher-end
version the overclocked version there
was so much copper in the thing it felt
like it just like to grab a metal brick
yeah a pickup and then here's the back
plate oh yeah there's a lot of
innovation actually has a bit more slits
I mean I you know these these back
plates that are just a single flat piece
of aluminum don't do a whole lot as far
as acting as a heat sink but you know
they can't add a lot to the look and I
thought this would look I think I think
the slats are more more effective than
actually they can do more to allow
airflow and over the
components in there that may be getting
be getting a little warm so yeah some
consider but yeah that design I was this
is I feel like this is getting closer
definitely closer than their extreme
series I think it still looks like a
plastic shroud which is not gonna be
quite as high quality as the 900 series
one that we were just looking at yeah
but overall it looks like it's workable
looks like you know you could make it
color neutral if you want to spray paint
or color in the orange accents there and
it is a 1070 TI let's just hope to god
that we can overclock it and that we
still have an unlocked core in there
very interesting yeah overclocked
performance compared compared to 1080
for example yeah we still don't know
what the clock speeds are on that card
either because it's just it just haven't
hasn't been officially announced but
speaking of new hardware we've also got
some new cases from NZ XD these there is
it's H series cases ok so just just bear
with me folks we've got three new cases
a lot to take in right now we've got the
H 700 I which has a mid tower ATX very
similar to maybe the H 440 for example
and then we've got the H 400 I this is
also sitting very close to like the the
cooler master H 500 P it's very similar
naming scheme here so the H 400 I is a
micro ATX chassis and then we've got the
H 200 I notice how as the numbers get
smaller we go with the smaller cases and
that is the Mini ITX version I suppose
so showing all these sorry yeah H 700 I
full-size so all these cases regardless
of which one you pick or have an
integrated smart device controller which
is essentially going to give you the
same capabilities as their grid plus or
their hue plus devices so each each of
these cases will ship with just imagine
them shipping with a hue plus already
built in that's cool which is kind of
cool for lots of things the cases will
ship with pre-installed RGB lighting as
well and pre-wired air F fans air the
air series fans from NZ exterior
a you're saving the cost and hassle of
adding RGB and fan controllers yourself
so this seems like you know you buy the
case
traditionally you buy the case and if
you want RGB you buy RGB lighting in the
form of just regular strips or something
like a hue plus or some other like
commander pro controller to get
everything up and running these cases
NZXT tees plan for these cases is just
to have everything set up for you as
soon as you buy the case inside the case
you get the controller and the RGB
lighting and the fans and it's all good
all right why does it NZXT design
motherboards I like their this
motherboard design they have here
there's a sexy little board concept
there yeah dots you know little dots
yeah it almost looks like an art like
asus rog tough armor or something like
that a little bit yeah Reese uses a
tough armor so I like that they've taken
like their s340 right very very popular
case for them they've had very many
different revisions of it and stuff that
had a distinct sort of cable management
bar that went yeah in the middle then I
feel like kind of made it stand out like
you immediately know that's the nest
important ways that I like that they've
kind of taken that element which was
distinctive there they've modified it
just a little bit here still kind of it
looks like you can fast like water
cooling hoses over it in this case here
so it comes out towards the front a
little bit more it must be removed that
might even be I'm not pot like almost
looks like it's room for a 5 and a
quarter bay but that that's probably not
true still looks like you have your
little this one doesn't do that though
it looks like you've got either you know
to 40 or to 80 millimeter radiator
mounting options at the front um pretty
pretty typical of the H 440 and s3 40
cases you might also notice that or
actually it references a patent pending
cable management system which I'm
wondering if that's the cable management
bar that you see there additionally it
comes with an adaptive noise reduction
technology or feature the smart device
which is kind of like the hue plus again
it has a sound sensor in it to measure
fan noise okay so another unit of net or
another metric that you can measure
the acoustics or the noise output of
your chassis with this smart device unit
which is interesting I'm curious as to
how that works it's also going to be
using cloud-based out algorithms to
leverage the the power of shared data
and machine learning to create fan
curves for you so that it can reduce you
know fan noise up to what is it forty
percent or something like that a little
bit your case has machine learning your
case now has machine learning according
to inspection what yes all right
it uses the smart device this it's it's
all centered around the smart device
Paul the smart device is like the brain
of your computer case that now has these
club based algorithms that can use other
users data so if you decide to share
your your user data with NZXT they can
use that to create custom fan curves for
you so you never have to do it manually
which is pretty cool it'll be
interesting to see how this all works
out I would imagine this is something
that's built within cam within the cam
software they've been NZXT has really
been pushing for that mm-hmm all the
cases will feature all the way down to
the Mini ITX model which I appreciate
will feature a tempered glass side panel
I think that's pretty standard here in
2017 cool MSRP pricing through the H 700
I which is the mid tower ATX case is
gonna be $200 USD pretty steep okay
again you're getting not just you know
all the tempered glass side panel cable
management Bowl wah you need unique
aesthetic but the smart device
controller all the things that it does
and the built-in RGB lighting which I
suppose if you add it all up might get
you to around $200 I'm not sure and then
you've got the H 400 I for a hundred and
fifty dollars that's gonna be available
in late November apparently the H 700 I
is already available now according to
the article and then finally we've got
the Mini ITX H 200 I for a hundred and
thirty bucks USD that's going to be
available late this year
interesting how they kind of did a
revamp on the site the the front met
mesh up here kind of like polka-dotted I
wonder if they found that that's more
effective than the the just the top and
top and bottom opening that they had
previously cuz that used to be solid the
entire side mm-hmm the whole side was
solid member is just the top bottom had
these big openings but the side was
completely closed off I don't know if
I'm a huge fan of that new aesthetic
from the side there and the front grille
but if it reduces thermals more I'm all
for it
should be some should proof for some
interesting testing they can do to
improve air flow is good yeah I mean it
looks the thing is is like it doesn't
look terribly different from like the
s340
you know what I mean it looks kind of
like it like at first glance it just
looks like an S 340 which I feel
conflicted about because for me is like
I love the s340 so much I don't really
turn zxt case it's a very similar
central Bart right here so yeah I'm just
I'm just wondering if people are gonna
pay $100 more for an S 340 because it
has the smart device unit inside of it
with RGB lighting what's going on with
the graphics card here well that's one
of the eight pin and a 6 pin power
connector but the 6 pin doesn't even
appear to be attached to the PCB these
are these are just renders these are yes
they are these NZXT state your engine
I'm just I'm just pointing this out this
appears to be it's like it's a new grad
like a stars that NZXT is working NZXT
has a new graphics card I think we just
discovered a leak I think that's what
that is
leak leak gtx 1070 ti-ti NZXT is gonna
be competing with nvidia and AMD Radeon
Fritz is the GTX 10 1075 Ti it's a it's
a half step between the 1070 Ti and the
GTX 1080
just just squeeze and it just has to to
CUDA cores decision yes I don't know 450
is just like and I'd like a little bit
more power if I'm more a little bit more
powerful power for 450 bucks but 500
that's just a little too rich for my
blood
what I want is a perfect for turn $80
register I didn't break 12,000 it's an
event that's the 1070 cut 1107 70 TD T
ite
BB a heyo so I'm be able to look at for
the H series cases from good ol NZXT and
finally our last news article for
today's show is about the Google pixel 2
and the pixel to excel this is a
straight-up review from the folks over
at hot hardware overall TL DR so you
have to go through the whole thing it's
good these phones are good Paul you
pre-ordered yours already he's a good
phone your Excel and you should be happy
that you did because they gave it their
recommended award that m2 to tests they
had an extensive list and due to the
battery is most impressive Excel Excel
with a raging score there lots of pros
very few cons I'll go over the cons
first it's pricey you're gonna pay a lot
for this phone for an Excel it's like
around 850 bucks don't care about that I
mean but then again it's no carrier and
yeah no carrier fully unlocked screw
everyone so that will be pixel X well I
don't know if they're if they have any
carrier tie-ins I would assume they'd
have carrier tie-ins where you can sign
up for two your contract and get some
kind I'm sure yeah there's also no no
headphone jack no legacy headphone jack
that's my biggest disappointment he's
gonna be a you know for some and not a
huge issue for others it really depends
on its lifestyles my biggest
disappointment tied for also no SD and
micro SD card yes yeah you know what the
LGV 30 looks pretty good I think I was a
I saw a video on date it was Dave 2d you
know Dave TD mmm-hmm he did a pretty
good video on why you should not or
before you buy a pixel to watch this
video and he was like saying like how
the LGV three-30 is a very highly under
rated phone it's got not only a
headphone jack but a micro SD card and
the headphone jack actually has that
phone has an internal back it has an
upgraded DAC so that you get premium
sound from your phone so if you want to
pair like you know like my DT a eighty
pros from biodynamic with my phone you
know you get some pretty decent sound
output I would imagine so that sort of
turned me on to that it doesn't be kind
of cool however doesn't aren't those 300
ohm headphones they are but if it's a
DAC amp then it it might be able to
drive it if it's compatible then maybe
it might be over there and I just sound
really quiet though
that's true you just get a little but I
don't get a little portable I can get a
lot more power to drive 300 ohms which
might not be practical for a smart phone
but yeah yeah I mean it depends it
depends an amp anoon as well but all I'm
saying is that there are options there
are many options right now and it's very
competitive space in the mobile market
quick quick hi to taco ja taku thanks
for thanks for watching Kuja and there's
lots there's lots to love however about
the Google pixel 2 and pixel 2 XL some
of the pros that they were going on
about we're the design and build quality
this is a top notch just like the first
one um pure Android Oreo I think that's
probably one of the biggest selling
points as you get a pure Android
experience frickin vanilla
I love the pure Android experience I do
too I have a heart it's like going back
to like like like Windows XP when you
could get Windows XP versions like
pre-loaded on like a Dell computer or
something like that a bunch of bloatware
and stuff like that and like doing the
doing the clean install it's like a
clean install of Windows yes like this
like the vanilla Android yes
there's no shitty custom UI that Samsung
or LG or anyone has overlaid their own
Sense UI whatever the hell it is it's a
pure Android experience that just the
way Google intended Android is Google's
creation after all it's probably best
presented with no
no interference from other companies
also people are saying on the LGV 30
that the DAC does have an amp and it can
support 600 ohm headphones okay that's
pretty badass
printable sects pretty cool that's a
cool little feature there for
enthusiasts slash audio files and stuff
but additionally hot hardware we went on
to say that some of the cool apps and
features of Oreo and the new pixel also
made it a really great buy including
google now playing which I've never
heard of Google now playing is kind of
like an always-on Shazam's different
than Google now different than Google
now it's Google now playing which is
kind of like having Shazam on all the
time so if you just happen to be like
chill in your car and like a phone like
you're on the radio and the radio song
comes on you're like I like the song
your phone will automatically be
listening to that song only only music
it only listens to music this is listen
to words or conversations or dialogue as
far as we know and it will show you on
your lockscreen the title and a name of
the song so you don't - Shazam it and
then from there you can tell Google
assistant - oh oh you know save this
song to my Spotify or save it to my
Google now or Google Play I think that's
pretty cool
as someone who listen to another cool
feature that makes it like like yeah I
don't care that my phone's listening to
me all the time yeah right what could go
another reason to enable that active
listening feature 24/7 is aren't you
phone listening to every word I say no
no it just starts talking back so you
know I notice you did let I would never
do that your privacy is important to me
additionally cutting edge performance
it's got some top ranks on the
benchmarks and stuff
I love how little attention we give to
like mobile benchmarks but we pour so
much of it into like the desktop scene
but yeah asking a bit
some sounds like boots and as little as
10 seconds which i think is a huge plus
that's the one thing that I don't like
about Google pixel so what pointed that
out recently is it like by though by the
way when you compare the crossover
between like smartphones and computers
back in like say the late 2000s
smartphones always had a thing it's like
oh it's just oh it's just where you just
pick it up and it's functional someone
pointed out recently restarting your
smartphone takes like two minutes now
yeah whereas starting a desktop takes
like eight seven to fifteen so yeah 10
and then 15 seconds maybe before it's
fully on and function usable and they
say yeah yes what does little most
things Clippy floppies but yeah I mean
this pixel too is gonna boot in as
little as 10 seconds which is great news
yeah and then obviously the camera is
gonna be better than the pixel the
original pixel excellent displays its
ip67 dust and waterproof
yeah no wireless charging though what
what who said what random random chat
Kyle's hairline backwards is a pyramid
my hair Thank you Thank You Elijah
that's very what Noah is like you're
right what an astute observation I have
a pretty wicked hairline breadth and
it's more apparent the longer my hair
gets because it all just sort of
accentuates oh whoa but the screen just
cut out black it flickered black for a
second just our awesome hardware not
that not the entire monitor but just our
stream well you know how shaky that
connection is between the camera in the
computer right now remember I know yeah
we've been trying to breathe too hard
can't touch the table can't move yeah um
but the Google pixel is available now in
select retailers you can probably buy it
on Amazon stuff kitchen when's yours
coming hm z Inc just challenged me to
restart my pixel do it
oh let's do it let's do a test oh I was
gonna say we can do that it's already
happening with a face hell mu sorry go
black eye
haven't been timing this alright we've
got so we've got awesome hardware I'm
sorry we've got pip my PC as our next
segment thank you guys so much
oh my god it's so slowly deteriorating
still shutting down wow really had to
close out all those pornhub videos I
mean how many pornhub tabs did you
actually have open Paul a pretty
standard amount is the amount you would
expect a standard amount well hopefully
the pixel to be better at handling
pornhub tabs I've got the little leap
frogging dots thing going Oh yours right
everybody back yep now I'm gonna say
that was about a minute about a minute
yeah cuz I started looking at the time
and it's about 40 seconds now is
probably bout 20 seconds before is it
about a minute so that terrible not
terrible but to be fair I'm sure you
would have cut that down significantly
if your phone was already off
yeah the shutdown I shut my power down
takes took a while that's a Glock but
let's move on to put my PC where you
guys have submitted your rigs for our
critique we shall be containing our
systems telling you everything you've
done wrong starting with Stephen Stephen
this is it is Halloween at all hey core
i7 4790k and NVIDIA GTX 1088 50g to
power supply 24 gigs of ddr3 mastercase
pro 5 and to 512 gig 850 pros all right
what are we gonna reckon here here here
here it looks like you've got the case
of this
oh it's mastercase 5 yeah of course um
you mastercase pro uh alright so jeez
you know what man I would say it looks
great I'm change a thing alright we got
the red and black yeah so coach games on
point I'm not seeing too much standing
out that's that's that's power supply
I'm not going on there so now here is
with with the side panel on is this
basement completely blocked off is it
because that would change much I think
it is my thoughts about this I have a
feeling your basement is blocked off
which I believe is the case and then yet
don't worry about it first but I don't
worry about your these red cables
otherwise you want to get those it's
like really the early EVGA supernova
supernova power supplies I thought it
made sense they have red peace yeah
let's make that all the PCI Express
graphics cables bright red that's what
people want and then they realize that
was stupid people in chat are saying
dust dust it yeah lots of people saying
is a pretty healthy dust into dust no
degree it looks ice I'm seeing here
let's definitely buy the US and the Grom
you can see a line here where it has
been dusted so just not really
thoroughly yeah all right now we also
have a least and LED strips you're
facing straight out which I'm not really
seen as lit up right now unless it's all
white but this is generally not you know
usually you want to have the LEDs kind
of tucked away pointing light another
thing you don't want to be able to see
the actual LEDs yes I just want to be
able to see the light that it's
projecting that might be a consideration
as with many builds we discussed in the
show a cable extension kit here would
would make things look a bit cleaner
here with your 24 pin and your PCI
Express graphics cables other than that
your Cal management's clean could use a
little bit more dusting like people
mentioned but pretty pretty solid build
overall is I would say how did you
manage to get your strix graphics card
to not sag like a mofo that's true
I feel like every strix card i've got in
the last year has just had massive sag
issue yes it has like a rigid metal bar
it's like a stilt as part of you just
like still penny put into the sleeve of
that PCIe cable it would be my guess
well wonderful rig sir thank you very
much even next up we've got Damien
Damien what do you got what you got
first name nearly six year old gaming PC
the back can be open but it got no room
for cable management though haha
aha then what using correction it's
nearly five years old five years old not
nearly six years old very important
laddie followed up with that you know
first off I like the tagging going on up
the side here hmm I think that is a nice
necklace now it adds some danger it
makes you feel like danger amazing bad
boy maybe I have wandered into the wrong
neighborhood where this PC is and maybe
I'm about to get jumped but you know
what that's the spice of life is you
know the onion jumped I'm getting jumped
a little bit of masochism never hurt
anyone
all right so now obviously we got a big
ol mess of cables just dead center here
yes which is really really destroying
any hope you have it at the overall
aesthetic here now true it being a six
year or five year old PC forgive me I
think it's just time for a Janeiro or
Janeiro a general upgrade I was gonna
say generic a general upgrade yeah I
think you need to upgrade the whole
system pretty much you might be able to
carry over the harddrive perhaps um but
ditch everything else it looks like you
can maybe go for like a I don't know a
mid-range to budget rising system
perhaps maybe upgrade the GPU definitely
the case because most cases nowadays
even for like 80 bucks or 60 bucks you
should have some room behind the
motherboard tray to route your cables
where you don't have to deal with this
anymore
yep also if you invest in a semi modular
or fully modular power supply that's
gonna significantly reduce the amount of
cable clutter you see on this nice sort
of vanity side of your system now on the
off chance that you are are poor and
have no money which is fine like no
that's you're poor you're not allowed to
watch a show we only care very much as
people but if you if you don't have any
money to upgrade and you're just looking
for something to do
I'd say flipping this power supply could
potentially give you a little bit more
wiggle room with your cable management
over here you've got a fan facing up you
can point that fan down and that'll take
your power supply cabling and I'm put it
back here towards the back of the case
and then you might be
do something with riding the cables up
here along the edge of the motherboard
to make it a little bit cleaner and get
rid of this rat's nest that you have
going on at the center hmm
but yeah that would be just if you have
no money to to upgrade this entire
system and free time on your hands I
guess yeah but thank you
Damien for sending in your submission
Damien is this Anthony me a low and
undead 2 5 88 on Twitter with an FX 6300
based rig as well as an RX 460 welcoming
us to bring on the shame Wow
alright now our first off want to point
out awesome action figure the action
figures they're all impeding airflow and
they should all be burned immediately I
like that there's a there's clearly a
scene going on here there is something
happening you know you have you got this
you got the sniper up top who's being
hidden but he's been spotted by the
guard here this is no longer a system
this is a diorama yeah I'm down here
obviously you got a hostage negotiation
in progress
wanna hang getting overseen by the the
white helmeted red red dude with the
sword or a gun I'm not sure what he's
holding there but yeah or maybe um
we we're gonna be in suspense I feel
like we're gonna be left in suspense as
to the outcome of this particular drama
and the bottom standing on a leg oh it's
on you're right
he's on a Lego there's a little bit more
height plot twist
the universes have melded he does that
gives him the high ground that gets him
the advantage point I do also want to
point out we got a Linksys router here
just solid just obviously positioned for
maximum airflow it is yes
hanging precariously from what we can
tell but that gives us an excellent
amount of airflow to the back and the
front of the unit I'm just gonna keep
keep things cooler got those case fans
pulling some hot air off of it can
improve your your network speed and even
notice time dude in the ATX cable and
the motherboard 24 pin cable yeah that's
what I said he's he spotted the sniper
up here and that's why the question is
why should L fee is the sniper gonna
fulfill his mission to take
to take out this guy here or will this
dude here hey it's one of those
ambiguous stories you're not really sure
here the protest is no you're not sure
who to root for I really want to see how
this end also we got some what looks
like Marley is this yeah but mate malt
liquor over here now it says mango on it
it's organic its organic maybe just the
mango or something like juice I thought
he might have been trying to include
some some advertising there could be a
mango beer could be a mango beer which
never tried before right yeah system
looks great yeah I'm so distracted by
all all the action that's going on I've
completely forgotten about the build
itself but it looks good does or do you
have memory and your slots yeah this
memory okay
to stick thing okay nice clean kill
Madrid suite well done thank you very
much sir Thank You Anthony next thing we
got Carlos Carlos God 4690k GT X 1080 16
gigs of Dom flats and an EVGA 650
anyplace display looks like you've done
some mspaint in here with the green I'm
not sure what the green is all about I'm
not sure what's going on here
but I'm gonna be out where it is what's
the deal with that I'm gonna ignore the
green and just focus on the build here
um
cable management looks pretty good
pretty good for the most part the only
thing I would say is that the SATA
cables the red SATA cables that are
coming on your drives to the right how
they're sort of hanging down if you
could maybe tuck those away behind the
motherboard tray so they're completely
out of sight like that would clean up
the look that overall additionally I'm a
huge fan of matching fans so at the
front you do have one white and one red
LED fan if you could maybe sync those up
it looks like you've got a red red red
and black thing going on might as well
just stick to it maybe replace that
white fan and maybe the top two white
fans with more those same red LED fans I
think it would look a lot more cohesive
and sort of tie the bill together would
match all the cables and all of the the
red accents on your graphics card and
stuff like that so confused by this by
the green the green it was the green
what does it mean what is he trying to
be us it was like what is he saying it's
like he's got a clear side panel and
he's like this is where I'm gonna cut
out oh maybe that's where the side panel
is but it's that you're right maybe
that's where when he puts the side panel
oh that's where the window is that's
what you can see that's what you can see
perhaps so you can't see these cables
over here that we're critiquing yeah was
it yeah switch
it's an NZXT yeah here you know what you
use a very clear case of you get a nice
what appears to be a hyper 212 variants
that I feel like is in need of an
upgrade that's the things standing out
to be the most that looks the lowest
budgets in this build I think which what
was that the power of the see vehicle is
unique oh yes yeah it's like average 212
sure just something that has a more a
more appealing fasciae on the front or
whatever some you know make me one of
those new not two coolers with the with
the cover on it or you know the all
black inner mat experience or like or
even like a cooler master master air for
maker for the makeup for for example um
you know just a nice yeah nice version
still good cooling and that looks a lot
better but yeah thank you to Carlos come
on one more we've got Ryan Ryan chunk
right so this is an i-5 6400 CPU cry
every age five cooler MSI z170a - a pro
g.skill ripjaws - by aching memory
Cathedral for 2400 a 2 terabyte hard
drive and a Samsung 850 Evo 250 gig SSD
r9 380 4 gig graphics card course event
at C 70 case which ok ok hmm
hmm.well aesthetic wise the motherboard
is brown
yeah motherboard standing out so it's
Anna laughing it's flashing it's its
budget miss ma bugs with its brown PCB
and dragging down the rest of the system
as far as a look at it right there is a
really hot flash going on as far as on
your cooler there so it's difficult to
say that is a cry rig h5 which air
coolers fine
the clue is find it slick flash let's
make it all just a flash that's yeah the
cable management is adequate it doesn't
look that great but at the same time I'm
not exactly sure what to tell you to do
to improve it I think it's also because
the motherboard is so narrow that the
yeah that right edge of the motherboard
is so far away from the grommets in the
case that you kind of have to stretch
the cables over the cables there's a lot
of cable showing yeah even though there
doesn't need to be so perhaps a case of
grade would do you some good
because your core components are pretty
good still a core i5 6400 and the r9 380
let's say a case up here maybe like even
motherboard upgrade yeah definitely a
motherboard upgrade yeah and the
motherboard is I feel like what drags it
down the most yeah but yeah that'd be a
pure aesthetic upgrade cuz get a Z 270
board you could still fit that 6400 in
there you couldn't do that and then
you'd still have an upgrade path yeah
because you could go to cable and ok be
there yeah yeah I think that's a pretty
good option honestly unless you know
you're perfectly fine with the
performance that you're getting out of
it now I think the case the case is
definitely it was a great case for its
time to see 70 may rest in peace but I
feel like cases have come such a long
way since then to where just the system
overall looks dated he does of the case
he says he overclocked is 6400 to 4
- so um upgrading his motherboard might
mean he needs to switch to something
with a BIOS that doesn't allow
overclocking on the 6,400 anymore so
yeah so yeah you might be stuck with
that motherboard if you really want to
get the most out of your 64 a good point
maybe yeah go for Rison or something
like that you know I mean those are
still you'd still have pretty recently
bonus it's a solid build so like that's
why my biggest hesitation for saying
those swap this at our swap that out
like there's no real need to upgrade
much of this hard work right there's a
media format standpoint it's just for
aesthetics so that makes it kind of
interact a little bit yeah yeah I mean
but but the thing is like you could
still probably sell the components you
have like the CPU and motherboard for a
pretty decent price that's true because
we're not terribly old maybe just some
swapping out mm-hmm do us do a sell sell
one or two of the parts invest a little
bit more money and then upgrade to
slightly newer stuff that that looks so
bad that could be and definitely the
case I think the case is holding you
back is from a cosmetic standpoint I
don't mind to see 70 I don't even it's a
great case again but there are a lot of
features about it or there's so there
have been so many new features that have
come along with cases in the past two or
three years tempered glass for example
you know RGB lighting stuff like that
that's true um but overall a very
functional and well working system I'm
sure thank you very much Ryan and that
is all the time we have for pin my PC
let's go ahead and do a sponsor spot
spot spot deep cool deep and a big thank
you to deep cool for sponsoring out some
hardware for the month of October today
we are featuring a oh I already boxed
mine oh yes unbox it again the captain
the captain 240 X yes in black however
Paul has a white version we got two
variants of the captain 240 X deep cools
or RGB models which means not only do
you get it all in one liquid cooler oh
yeah such as this one right here with a
240 millimeter radiator available with a
white finish like I'm showing it right
now White's on the radiator and white on
the pump / block combo unit down there
but you also get an RGB LED controller a
little controller unit knob thingy yes
that's in there you get an RGB LED strip
and you get a little four-way fan plug
adapter so you can plug in that you can
set up a push-pull configuration with
these you sure can yes I have white
accents on the fans here so you can see
the white and black design with this
version and then all black fans with the
black version all black rubberized
corners black fans matter yes they do
hot products not products that stay cool
yeah okay a little control guys here so
yeah you can plug in power to the
controller and that's got three little
buttons on it so you can control the
brightness I can mode the color and you
can cycle between different modes so if
you don't have a motherboard that plugs
in that has an RGB header on it but you
still want RGB you can use that
controller to give yourself the RGB
functionality it's not necessarily
needing the motherboard for it also
carefully setting this aside if you do
have the motherboard for it then do bear
in mind that these are compatible with a
C's or a sink
I thought there were some other ones
listed here too but it's at least
available compatible thesis or sync yeah
which is the best one obviously there
are other ones out there too and I
believe there are some additional
compatibilities but I don't want to
promise anything I have a positive oh so
there we go finally RGB of course means
that the captain 240 X RGB as shown here
on the TV website which is no I was
right that was right or a sync gigabyte
RGB fusion and MSI mr. Blake's yeah
those are the big three this is the big
three those are not compatible most RGB
things these days are compatible with
those three softwares at least
oh and asrock they've added that as dark
as dark RGB LEDs so those are those that
are pretty much all RGB LED systems and
noise and there's a quick look at the
you know noise LED strips that you get
as well as the light up of the actual
unit itself it's not compatible down
there inside it's not compatible with
the EVGA RGB software because there is
none because EVGA hates RGB Shh there we
go all right well thank you very much
deep cooler sponsoring this episode of
awesome hardware we appreciate it and if
you guys want more information on their
coolers I've put a link in my video
description moving on to question and
answers you guys have questions we've
got answers let's go over all right now
starting with
my house episode Steve Finlay for the
tenkan a deer's no commies Canadian I
think you use Steve thank you very much
appreciate Tom Briggs myths 15 Norwegian
krone us so sell didn't put my down
donation bad so bad anyway there are
some snacks in Paul's pillbox one of
them are called Reaper for Halloween
oh god you get some snacks one of which
is called very poor for Halloween I will
check that before next week's show
thanks Don before you move on though
there was a couple leftovers from my
house I'll put on there
Randall mu $5 donation I Paul and Kyle
what are your opinions on thermaltake
Thermaltake well scandal about that is
Thermaltake is accused of copying lots
of designs from other case manufacturers
at most most most specifically case labs
was the big kerfuffle that happened as a
year to go fractal J they yeah there's
also accusations of them ripping off
case designs from other case
manufacturers such as fractal and
otherwise J Jade doesn't doesn't do
anything with Thermaltake he's just
completely hands-off we cut them you
have a sponsorship contract I do you do
I thought I've seen you do a Thermaltake
pre-roll with that I've not done o
Thermaltake pre-roll this year really
enter max Ehrmann alright maybe I'm
confusing that with someone else then I
thought you did okay nevermind
I don't didn't a thermaltake case
recently okay more or less than the fee
in the last few months is that the view
7 or the that was the no wasn't the
view it wasn't the view is it was a more
budget oriented case but the way I see
this like they've got their own thing
going on if they're you know
guilty or not guilty of plagiarizing or
copying other companies I don't know I
don't know all the facts I haven't done
the research I haven't done the time to
really formulate a straight opinion on
the matter all I know is that sometimes
their parts work for what I need and I
will use those parts because the build
that I'm doing or the project that I'm
doing
for it and I'm able to separate how they
are and how they function as a company
morally and ethically versus the
products that they make and what I need
to do to get my project done personally
that I'm able to separate I'm not a
hundred percent whole J I understand
Jays perspective but I also know what my
needs are and if they have a product
that's gonna fit that need then I'm
gonna use it because I need it
and there's nothing else that's gonna do
a better job about it but you know I
don't know what you think I haven't
worked I haven't worked much with
Thermaltake Mike my contact there was
Shannon and he doesn't work there
anymore
so I don't really have an active contact
that Thermaltake I know there's some
products that they've developed that
haven't been ripoffs and I've used some
of their products in the past that I've
been that I've liked they didn't old
Thermaltake Frio cooler was an air
cooler that I used to like quite well
that was the black and red one yes black
and red and it was only about you know I
could get it for forty five fifty bucks
and it was a nice mid mid range between
like your budget hyper 212 ish mmm-hmm
variance and like the high ends stuff
you'd have to pay 70 or 80 bucks for
right but yeah they all saw the level 10
chassis which they designed with BMW
design works USA and they've had several
quite a few derivative chassis kind of
based on the carrying on of that and
that like their p5 chassis is based on
that I believe um so yeah I I'm not like
absolutely opposed to working with them
but I don't necessarily reach out to
work with them either I guess yeah I
don't know there are very few companies
these days I feel like I actually reach
out to work with yeah that's true name I
hope that's a reasonable answer for you
uh yeah this is supposed to be a quick
side thing but Steve Finley 10 Canadian

NES is pretty pretty baller that's
pretty that's classic alright okay thank
you
67 $19.67 many years in our donation
amount from an odd sort of guy I was
curious are you going to twitchcon keep
up the good work
in fact MB I am NOT going twitchcon but
myself and potentially fractal Josh and
wifey sauce and stuff and maybe pulp
will be at a meet-up on Friday evening
the Friday of twitchcon to just hang out
with some of you guys it will be at sort
of a casual super casual low-key bar
something to be like loud or anything
like that
we can all just talk and hang out
hopefully Friday evening this Friday
evening we'll be able to hook up with
some of you guys who were there so but
I'm not going to actually twist con no
me neither
all right Gerald or a drawl who knows $5
so if I got this right
after asking your favorite types of brew
Kyle you're a drunk and Paul you like
anything that is not sours or IPAs done
and done yep and no have no Hefeweizen I
don't know how I'm a drunk just because
I said I liked all alcohol I'm willing
to drink it it's make you a drunk all
day anyway
Jeremiah Hyatt poet everybody knows hey
now that you've practiced more funny
handshakes my wife called you guys
noobs for that last one well I generally
pride myself on my funny handshake
ability but apparently this time I did
not complete let's do the 80s let's do
the 80s style high-five here I go up
high and then down down low and then do
it again at the bottom yeah all right
here we go
 yeah that's with on the bottom one
ever takes practice yeah here we go Hey
mmm already committed to muscle memory
who knows that counts as a handshake
show your wife that one as well as my
favorite she'll drop her pain I was
impressed as impressive oh all right all
right here we go
d2 and $35 2x8 3k lpx Rams is suitable
or suitable for a sixteen hundred
building for an F you different configs
are listed okay but not to buy eight
suggestions other than flair X Y Z scale
will find the coarser LP x 3000 speed
memory and my experience has worked just
fine with all the rides and systems I
tested on running at 29 33 so you're not
gonna be able to do 3,000 because that's
not a memory divider for Rison but you
will be able to do 29 and 33 which is
you know 90s good enough 7% of what you
need so yeah I think you'd be fine with
that I've had very good luck with
g.skill Ram and yeah the flare X memory
is super compatible
but it also super kind of premium price
so that kind of sucks for that yeah
there's that we got Aaron Barlow $5.00
cheers and thanks as always for a fun
stream Thank You Aaron
if we're not here if we're not having
fun what are we doing here what's the

those go ahead and preview curious codex
for us and let us know if she is worthy
to stream by the end of the show Brandon
Dickerson $5 another one also do you
think and Noctua Nhu 12s is enough to
tame an 80 700 K in a micro ATX case I
think it is I personally think so the
Nhu 12s is a fantastic cooler
it could be comparable to a lot of a iOS
- believe it or not from some of the
testing that I've seen even for an 8700
k unless you're trying to hit like 5.2
gigahertz or something like that then
you might want to straight towards
liquid but yeah I think you're gonna be
fine
we have any cream Oh whipped cream holy

perfectly adequate so if you like the
evolve it's a case I can Ashwin mera $10
donation $10 for Paul and $10 for $10
for Cal to I appreciate that that's
equal pay equal opportunity this feels
very soothing vaguely second I'm
slightly aroused it's got a Dilbeck with
these six dollars and sixty six donation
again what is it demonstrated ently hurt
yourself I think it was attempting to
clean up pie very tragic occurrence most
definitely dumbest way I've heard myself
do you you have any oh I did stay the
same yeah I was jumping up on a wall
when I was a kid like 12 and I grabbed
under the brick at the top and and the
Frick was loose and it fell back when I
fell on him I back in the
Rick planted on top of me that okay okay
you can't pile o RC helis $5 $5 just
started really watching the show series
whatever really enjoyed keep up the
great work thank you this is pretty
normal this is every every week hi
pretty good lord it still feels like I
have hairspray in there something like
that everywhere I hope my bat huh that's
gonna stain the curtain I know this
that's a rental right there it goes my
security deposit all right thank you
case Kay pilots RC helis can't pilot RC
Hailey's that was radio-controlled
helicopters I imagine after a panda
$5.00 I am soon to be an indie developer
I need help deciding on graphics card
gtx 1080i asus rog strix is what I'm
looking at any suggestions uh that's a
very good graphics card if that's what
you're looking at I think you'd be
pretty heavy with that one yes and
there's not too much I mean you'd be
spending a good hundred 100 to $200 less
on a 1080 or a lot more on a dime like a
site next so yeah I'd say to go with
that one Afro Panda it seems like you
got a good choice lined up another
donation from Kay pilot RC Hailey's five
dollars what rise in CPU would you
suggest I get to match my msi gtx 970
what those little bottlenecking as
possible mmm a 970 you shouldn't ride
much so yeah you should be able to give
I authorize in five to 1,600 I feel like
is a really good price to performance
option get a six six core twelfth red
processor that's overclockable oh that's
gonna stay in the desk
yes that's okay that was worth it next
time Fred it's $500 so yeah cover the
cost of the table the r5 1600 K PI that
I see Nellie's is what I would recommend
for you what cool fool $5.00 how's your
experience with the asus rog zenith just
got one for my pc bills
it's a crazy overkill motherboard i mean
it's like really really high-end x 399
so i feel like i haven't even begun to
explore all the different features of it
and stuff I really just
sort of a basic system and benchmarking
tests with mine
yeah but yeah I mean it's got I feel
like if I don't feel like there's
anything you might want to the next 399
board that that board doesn't have also
looks true also looks pretty cool Fred
Reines with the $100 donation I warned
you not take your wife out to dinner you
tight-ass next time will be much worse
wifey sauce and I have been tweeting for
awhile to set this up now take her to
dinner if if I wore my wife with the
nice dinner after she just tied me in
the face that isn't that that's that's
negative reinforcement that that is not
how I want to condition my place she's
down there helping clean it up right
there well she should be dedicated who
else would be other than the person who
clearly pied me in the face out maybe
like the pilot patron is a deterrent
it's like if you don't want more pie in
the face than you better to take her to
dinner oh good then I'm being threatened
by my own my own blood no not blood my
own wife god no no we're going out to
dinner to another game on the plus side
