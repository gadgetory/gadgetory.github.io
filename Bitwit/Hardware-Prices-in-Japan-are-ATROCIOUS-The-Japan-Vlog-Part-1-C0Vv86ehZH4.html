with the corsair HS 70 wireless gaming
headset memory foam ear cups provide
long lasting comfort backed by superior
sound quality and a detachable noise
cancelling microphone enjoy up to 16
hours of battery life and a 40 foot
range through a low latency 2.4
gigahertz wireless connection click the
link of the description to learn more
about the HS 70 wireless babe how you
doing
good can't wait to leave Taiwan though
why so we just checked into our hotel
we're in the room right now pretty tiny
we figured that we could do some laundry
here because I actually have washing
machines and drying machines but we
don't know how to change the temperature
so we're not sure if it's gonna ruin our
clothes or not but that's okay because
we have a human washing machine that is
on top of it I'm not sure if this is a
Samsung or an LG but that's a handsome
sound like a knockoff brand robot
restaurant the hell is this we check it
out
what kind of RGB hellhole did we just
step into
well that was fun I'm actually kind of
jealous that they got to use copyrighted
music and still make a profit off of it
Paris we had like 16 16 cocktails I
cannot count the cocktails we've had oh
my god somebody care how or what or why
but there's something about your
umbrella run the Akihabara district now
and I've been led to yo Dabashi which is
a massive massive electronic store let's
see what's inside
this is what looks to be an in wind 303
first glance but in reality it's AG
tuned chassis which I've never heard of
this one has a built an optical drive
I guess this case manufacturer and in
wind both go to the same om for this
particular case I also thought that was
a race fire cooler at first but it's
actually an Intel platform not exactly
sure about the CPU but we are on the z
270 chipset and this is a GT X 1080 but
look it's rocking some sort of reference
design that I do not recognize it's
certainly not a founders Edition from
Nvidia but it is a GT X 1080 nonetheless
I saw it on the sticker right there so
I'm learning pretty overwhelmed by the
sheer size of this place but the other
thing that you guys might not have known
is that this is actually a nine-story
building there a more floor suit I
thought this was an asus rog swift PG 3
4 8q when I first saw it but it's
actually the model number 4 XG 3 5vq
it's got all the same specs g-sync 100
Hertz ultra wide the one cosmetic
difference I spotted was that the little
accent here on the stand is actually red
and not gold like the the one that we
had back in the US pricing is one
hundred and forty thousand yen which is
about $1,400 u.s. puts it about four
hundred dollars more than what you could
find the pg3 4aq on amazon floor so
pretty pricey NZXT h seven hundred i or
as they call it here h 700 w for the
white and black almost 28,000 yen which
equates to about 250 US dollars you can
find this case right now on Amazon for
about 195 now find any deal so far but
what do you expect from an island four
hundred dollars for the resin seven 2700
X it's about eighty dollars more than
the US four hundred and nine dollars for
the core i7 eighty seven hundred K make
it stop
MSI's be 360 M order titanium ghost for
about one hundred and five dollars in
the states here it's more like a hundred
and forty five rog strict z 370 f gaming
going for around two hundred and thirty
seven dollars u.s. you can buy it on
amazon right now for a hundred nine
ouch all right let's take a look at the
memory not expecting any miracles here
Corsair Vengeance lpx ddr4 2 by 8 gig
kit so 16 gigs 2666 24,000 yen is about
two hundred and nineteen dollars that's
a pretty steep hike over the US pricing
of a hundred and seventy-five the
g.skill ripjaws five kits aren't looking
that much better TBH ZOTAC GeForce GTX
1080 Ti not sure if it's and perdition
or amp extreme or whatever but I pulled
it up on Amazon and right now the amp
extreme Core Edition is eight hundred
dollars u.s. 120 thousand yen for this
one is about eleven hundred damn Strix
gaming GTX 1060 going for about four
hundred and twenty dollars Asus GTX 1050
anywhere between 170 and 180 dollars
radian rxt Vegas 64 will set you back
about a cool grand here in Japan wild
gigabytes rx 570 goes for just shy of
500 us if you live in Japan and you're
in the PC building I'm sorry
truly from the bottom of my heart I'm
sorry for everything you know the prices
here are really nothing to write home
about in fact they're pretty gosh-darn
off holes but just the sheer volume of
hardware they have it kind of allows you
to build any system you want just the
options the options here phenomenal
you hear that song in the background
that's the theme song for your devotion
camera and they play it all day every
day
I hope they pay their workers well well
that was fun my senses are a bit
overloaded right now if you guys were
wondering where wifey sauce was this
whole time she actually wasn't feeling
great this morning so she hung back at
the hotel just where I'm going right now
so let's check on her see how she's
doing sleeping it's so wait get up
we're actually headed to Cote where
we'll be staying for one night and a
traditional Japanese David super fancy
live exactly
alright so we just checked into our
hotel here at the Gorica Don this is a
real Kent which is basically a
traditional Japanese Inn that's located
near a hot spring hot springs are
basically formations of water that are
naturally warmed by volcanic structures
and there's a ton of them here in the
Kona and this is a really nice hotel
probably the nicest hotel Wi-Fi Saucer I
have ever been to now it goes without
saying that it is not cheap to stay here
which is why wifey sauce and I are only
here for one night just for the
experience and I wanted to give you guys
a quick room tour because our room is
incredible but I just remembered that
Lyle my twin brother who some of you
guys are already familiar with actually
stayed in this exact room when he was
visiting Japan last year and he recorded
his own room tour so instead I'm just
gonna play you his room tour and you
guys let me know what you think oh we
are here a dagger a rocker down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
