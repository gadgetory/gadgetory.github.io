it should be - both yes YouTube and the
twitch welcome everybody
I guess I'll just I'll just dive right
in as we often do this is an awesome
hardware episode 135 side B if you
missed side a you can go ahead and check
it out on Paul's channel that's
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware you
can follow the link in the description
below if you're watching on twitch then
just stay where you are thanks for
joining us and sticking with us this far
this is a tech news show vaguely that we
like to do every single Tuesday at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time and yeah you know you
would like to have some fun drink some
beer occasionally once in a while we'll
have a potty mouth and then we'll swear
so if you have little ones around if you
have sensitive ears then you know just
making me nervous watching you do that
then that B be warned this is a show for
worried about first for mature
unmaterialistic clear why are you taking
your time so much with that
backcourt well this is so this is a
fruit he truly truly this is strawberry
beer and this is brought this is a
present from Joe editor he edits for
both of us and this is around
Christmastime it's also gone to Vegas
and back so I'm not sure if it's gonna
be in good shape or not how do you make
that look so easy just popped up I just
don't I just don't know how you just did
that cuz I mean when I try to do it well
I don't really have to go to details Rob
Eyrie
it's very strawberry what is that is
that the level we're at right now and
it's very strong and saving that months
ago that was my I was gonna save this
show a shot save this channel alright
cheers Cheers
to to all of you thanks for thanks for
being here tell free to drink along with
us that's good yummy
it's very strawberry tasty thanks Joe
lambic dammit yes good stuff um uh you
you guys should check out our stores we
sell stuff it's a great way to support
us and also get something in return
as opposed just like a like or a comment
or something like that we sell things
like shirts glasses mugs mouse pads and
and more yes this is the shirt that Kyle
is wearing today this is this is the
shirt I gave me everything mo it for you
right now I get comments on this shirt
all the times like hey is that you're
like yeah it's me on the show like yeah
I know that's your picture on it
basically that's the response I get but
you guys can wear it no consequence yeah
no problems there and Paul Stewart is
also great he's got plenty of stuff a
lot of similar things but like with you
know Paul Flair my logo to the kyles yes
and if you guys order something from
either of our stores will yell Johnson
at you by the end of the show or double
Johnson if you happen to get something
from both of our sites but it's even
doubly good and um yeah but that's
pretty much it that's our intro that's
that's what we got it's what we're
working with so we couldn't let's just
accept it move on let's just accept it
what exactly so we can dive into our
first segment sort of picking up where
Paul left off with tech news we have no
segment lower thirds no segment lower
thirds Rita's the Ramseys bullet before
the show it's total scramble today you
have everyone should be happy that we're
even streaming at all yeah but no Lord
no lower thirds today I know you'll all
forgive us because you're all kind of
nice so let's talk about our first
article here which is all sort of talked
about this little bit net neutrality and
how the fight to save net neutrality is
not over just because sheet pie and all
of his evil minions decided to you know
deregulate net neutrality after all the
good stuff that Tom wheeler had done
former chairman of the FCC it doesn't
mean that no neutrality is dead per se
not yet anyway because apparently there
have been let's see I guess you kinda
have to understand how it all works if
an independent agency like the FCC for
example is what we're talking about here
were to make a decision like fuck over
net neutrality
then the
federal lawmakers senators and that sort
of thing they still have 60 days to sort
of stand up and say no that's bullshit
to sort of overturn that decision before
it actually goes through this is under
the this is all falls under the
Congressional review Act okay so this is
sort of a good thing
congressional review act is is good for
anyone who doesn't want net neutrality
to go away right now because it's gonna
give us a fighting chance to to actually
bring it back or to reinstate it so
since last Tuesday about 40 senators
signed on and said we don't want net
neutrality to go away we want to keep it
and then since then 10 more senators
have signed on so we have a total of 50
I checked the math checks out that's
half the Senators the math checks out
that is half the Senators so Hyundai's a
jumbo there's 100 we have half you know
how many more we need to actually kill
this a Jeep pie nonsense we need 1 we
need we see one more senator and half
the house and a non veto from show but
hey I was getting I was getting two but
it's something but it's something yes
exactly so we not only do we need 51
senators to vote in favor of destroying
what a Jeep I is trying to do we would
also need that to go to the Republican
majority house and also have it signed
off by President Trump it sounds like a
lot of longshot because it kind of is
but anything is possible let's not lose
hope here that's when that's when
possibility dies is when you destroy
hope also the one remaining vote would
have to come I think your link is wrong
is it yeah damn it
say I'll see if I can fix it thing
please continue um the one remaining
vote that we would need is gonna have to
come from a from a Republican because
all all all the Democrats are already in
full support of net neutrality and we've
actually got you know a handful a
handful of Republicans on board so we
would just need one more Republican to
vote in favor of net neutrality and then
what are we doing the raid looks like
there's a raid going on I think Jerry I
got Jerry god damn it Jerry Jerry rated
always putting your poop naps and
people's business I don't know if that
means but it probably makes sense in
some some context hello
jerry a Muir's jerry viewers without me
guess we I like getting rated once in a
while yeah makes us feel makes me feel
miss sexy sexy hell yeah
can read my body can feel the hand it's
like I can physically feel the hands of
each Raider like rubbing us all over the
hashtag me too that's what I get
alright anyway so yeah it's it's a long
shot but we're still in the fight
the the first lawsuit to challenge is
eat pies decision could come as early by
the end of this month and then at that
point you know with a vote on the
congressional review act we could
potentially take that take place I can
potentially take place this summer
pending delays with the Congress
whatever they have on their schedule so
yeah this is all to say that don't lose
faith people we could still make the
internet a free and open Internet people
are all freaking out you know Lizzie Pye
did this and now Nitin Crowley's dead
not yet
it's looking like it kind of might be
but but not yet there's still a little
bit of hope the last hope um let's move
on though we got a lot of stuff to cover
here okay just I'm gonna really go over
this really quickly because Paul already
sort of touched on on his half but just
to reiterate that GPU prices are
absolutely insane right now and this is
an article from WCCO f Tech and there's
there's a couple reasons why a couple of
things that we could attribute to these
insane inflated prices just to briefly
go over the mining performance of these
cards of the cards that are affected are
pretty good and we'll expand on that a
little bit in sec lack of competition
and memory supply so it's interesting
that the Vegas 64 from AMD and the GTX
1080i from Nvidia have both increased in
pricing tenfold like an insane amount
but for different reasons there's some
overlap there but it's kind of
interesting how they point this out so
the Vegas 64 just to put things
perspective MSRP is $500 all right and
then it was probably around six seven
eight hundred dollars by the end of the
year now it's up to about 2100 depending
on where you look
which is crazy and so the reason why
they're the reasons that WCC F Tech is
giving for wide vague of 64 specifically
this is live live prices on new Ygritte
now and I'm not kidding this is not an
exaggeration this is two thousand
dollars for one Vegas 64 card where is
the frontier edition look a 6-pack of
frontier edition okay just get my mining
kit just when do I start selling six
packs of frontier editions it's an 8
it's probably a new exam I'll take it
it's probably a third party seller who's
selling or that yeah some do you shop
malls you shop mall is selling this you
get their feedback back reading that's
very solid I want to buy this just based
on the feedback ratings so Vegas 64 is a
outstanding mining card right now at
$800 when it was selling back for $800
late last year you could probably mine
and break even according to the article
in about four months you can break even
in about four months four months just
leave it 20 leave it on 24/7 not doing
shit you make your money back in about
four months that's not bad but now a
22,000 - $2,100 it would take you over a
year and a half roughly to make your
money back on buying one card so this is
definitely I'm definitely gonna be a
blow for a lot of minors but the hell do
we care they're minors and the 1080i has
no competing card at the moment I mean
you could argue Vega 56 kinda kinda is
that is the closest thing AMD really has
to it but you can hardly find a Vega 64
card anyway the ones you can are
obviously way overpriced look you can
get a GTX 1080 gaming box for 700 bucks
right now everyone should buy this and
one buy this right now wait that's just
the box
it's the box and there's a 1080 inside
oh there's a 1080 oh well that's not bad
usually ships in three to five days
that's actually not bad everyone by this
cheaper than what $0.10 looks you're
going stock its undoing buy it in mind
stuff that's cheaper than what 10 70s
are going for right now and you get a
box for it that's doable within
seventies so there's a hike in memory
prices as well due to the mining craze
hardware and box did a really good video
that they unleashed Unleashed released
earlier this week about why it's a bad
time to buy
or build your own system and memory
prices was like their part one video
they go and they do a deeper dive into
all of that you should go check it out
since it derived so when I found my new
leg yeah I like to click this new egg
only a radio button because I hate the
marketplace I hate it they're terrible
people everyone who works in the
marketplace I hate you know are they
also the new egg marketplace is selling
10 70s for 900 bucks each right now
starting the only one that's in stock is
eight hundred and ninety dollars that's
so insane there's a one in stock for a
thousand that's so ludicrous attend 70s
Ludacris even the one on the box is
going for 150 bucks over MSRP now
definitely get this gtx 1070 it comes
with a gaming box and it's three hundred
to three hundred dollars cheaper oh yeah
than any of the other competing ten 70s
I don't know why you wouldn't just buy
this
maybe that's probably sold out when I
click up it's not a mini looks like a
mini that's probably the mini yeah oh
it's cute but it's perfectly it's still
tense energy the gigabyte makes one of
the best Mon many high-end cards right
now
likewise otac why why would you buy one
of these $900 cards when he can get this
this box we're almost half the price
yeah yeah that's nuts
but yeah so crazy so anyway MSRP
suggestions they're all dead
it seems like pricing for GPUs and
memory and and and more computer
hardware is just more and more reliant
and dependent on the market trends and
this market equilibrium when it comes to
mining and memory supply and demand MSR
peas are just they're dead just crazy it
wasn't like this at least for at least
for certain things like SSDs obviously
is aren't affected by any of this really
but Jesus the most expensive part
arguably the most expensive part in your
system it just got way more expensive so
maybe maybe hold off on on building a
system for now um Intel
speaking of GPUs Intel's
pairing their own discrete GPUs believe
it or not for Gen 12 and Gen 13 this is
you know gen 12 and 13 CPUs their core
CPUs
these are codenamed Arctic sound and
Jupiter sound I think they're biting off
of your Arctic Panther a little bit they
are they're like we can't call it our
Panther but what happens every time he
says Arctic Panther there's an Arctic
sound that plays right after let's let's
see if this fits with Intel's code name
scheme which means it has to be on a map
so Arctic sound Arctic sound is a
popular city in Las Vegas Nevada so late
last year love you guys know Intel
snatched up Roger Kaduri which was the
now the ex senior VP and chief architect
of AMD and they're like a rather it
helped us develop some sand graphic
solutions because we suck at it and
writers like so we can do it and then
now they're gonna they're planning to
release some GPU integrated and discrete
GPU solutions in the next few years with
the help of Rajah Ashraf esse from The
Motley Fool posted some code names
that's where we got Arctic salmon and
Jupiter sound as Intel's this develop
business they are cheap solutions
that's it yeah Arctic sound it's Canada
up there in Nunavut it's in Canada yeah
I feel betrayed
why are they ever go to Canada this is
it right here it was just a life you
want the true authentic Arctic sound if
there's a lake this is where you know
it's a sound no that's impossible this
is not a lake it's part of the Arctic
Ocean and this is the sound because
there's what sound does the Arctic Ocean
make how is it different than any other
ocean it makes the Arctic sound why
don't you just call it ocean sound water
sound because doesn't sound cool
marketing tag marketing um so yeah we're
not gonna see these for a long time guys
don't get excited right now because this
is 12th and 13th June we're talking
about I mean we're not even on 10th June
yet which is gonna be caught canon late
right that still ways out so found
Jupiter sound maybe oh boy that's in
Florida
jupiter sound also an ocean what no it's
not it's part of the ocean it's a sound
see no it's a sound as a body of water
let me let me see if she's contiguous
with the ocean but separated by
individual let me see let me see your
street view of this sound this is street
view yeah I want to see a street view of
this sound let's take a look let's see
what the sound looks like oh look at
that ah it's a bunch of mangroves what
the hell wow oh wow it's like we don't
even need a visit here native any
different plants I thought was gonna say
native and exotic sounds where the
sounds why are they talking about plants
the Jupiter sends jupiter sound is right
next to it this is obviously a nice
trail here's a terrible terrible park
whatever it is they don't have their
priorities straight
there's Jupiter's sound right next to
you you're talking about plants it's
Florida I'm triggered okay anyway anyway
we don't really know anything about
these these these graphic solutions
other than their code names and that
they'll be connecting at least Arctic's
and sound will connect to the CPUs via
EMI B which has intel's embedded multi
interconnect bridge which accuse us in
to believe that we're gonna see a
similar solution as the 8th gen CPUs
that are paired with vega graphics
that'll sort of be the same solution
that's built on to these new graphic
solutions so you know is that is that
what it's gonna take for GPU discrete
GPU prices to finally drop is that intel
has to make a discrete GPU or that even
look like it's world coming to
I mean it would just look like any other
GPU cuz at the end of the day to add
board partnership with your player on it
I probably a sculpture out of the
sculpture a little skull on it bring
back the school anytime Intel does
something and they're like wow this is
actually cool let's put sculptural look
oh yeah schools are still cool because
we're still living in the 90s look a
minute look at sculpture our marketing
team still still mid-90s still listens
to corn and Slipknot
he's hit he knows the lingo corn I like
corn to corner the cops best motherboard
manufacturers let's move on to our next
story are addressing the specter and
meltdown exploits with BIOS updates as
Paul sort of mentioned on his half this
is an article from hot hardware just
want to let you guys know that there are
resources out there links from gigabyte
MSI and aces have just released all
these firmware updates for a ton of buy
the board models that offer further
protection and sort of mitigate meltdown
inspector issues asus there's a link on
the Asus website to over a hundred
motherboard models and their latest BIOS
ease so you can cross-reference that
with the whatever the latest BIOS update
available in the support section of your
motherboards product page just to make
sure that you're all up to date and
covered gigabyte has a link that they've
and they've also said that they'll
continue rolling out more updates over
the next few weeks as iterations to the
protections come out and then MSI has a
link as well so that you know you can
pretty much make sure that you have all
the latest protections and BIOS updates
there's no patch in sight as I mentioned
earlier on Paul's half for platforms
like z97 and beyond or older which is
kind of a bummer so if you know that's
what Devil's Canyon fear if you have a
devil's canyon by your computer three
years ago why should they support you at
all actually three years ago was a great
time to buy PC right as opposed to now
anyone who buys amazing now is is the
one who needs questioning more like four
years ago and perhaps yeah I didn't
there perhaps you got z170 updates
though c17 he's all good just once you
get to that those double digits your
yeah yes so well um so yeah just a
little bit of tidbit of information
there let's talk about our next story
here Chinese police the Chinese police
sorry I'm gonna get some shit for that
arrest they arrested 120 pub G cheap
makers Hey with the help of $0.10
damn straight 50 cents you
brother no no that's not right Tencent
is is a is a a Chinese multinational
investment holdings conglomerate and I'm
going to pretend like I know what that
means but they they have their hand in a
lot of different companies and and you
know entertainment AI and stuff they're
a multi-billion dollar revenue type of
company Tencent owns Weibo and yeah we
both yeah yep and they own Epic Games
and stuff so they are doing shit they're
actually banning or arresting these
cheap makers because it's a huge issue
for the game itself China and pub G have
an interesting relationship already
because China a few months back if you
guys remember was saying we don't even
want this and we want to do a perma ban
on this game because it violates our
socialistic core values is what China
said and then $0.10 kind of partnered up
with with the pub G Corp to sort of be
like well we kind of want this game to
be to exist we don't want to get
permabanned let's let's help you out
here well we'll try to make a modified
version of the game to you know bail
socialist and stuff it'll be great and
then we'll also like work on getting rid
of the cheaters because that's also a
huge issue that's driving a lot of
people away from this game and you know
making them flock to other alternatives
because there's a lot there are a lot of
copycats out now for this type of game
so they've actually arrested 120 people
who are suspected of designing cheat
software for the game specifically which
is good it's a good start
they're still like cheating in the game
though still runs rampant there there's
right now there's tons of cheating going
on which explains why I get killed all
the time it's not because I'm bad at the
game people's people are cheating that's
the only way they could possibly kill me
and you know and people are sneaky these
these players these cheaters
these cheaters are recruiting and higher
career like they're they're recruiting
other cheaters they're basically using
the in games leaderboards to advertise
their cheat software so if you're a
cheat developer let's say you develop
this really cool cheat software for that
for punji and then obviously you get on
the top of the leaderboard right because
you're cheating and then you're you
change your gamertag your username to
um something like call or contact QQ for
eight nine three six five and that that
that string of numbers is actually a
private QQ number which you know
obviously for for ten cents
QQ messaging service that a lot of
people in China use it's sort of like a
private number that you can call or
contact online to download or buy
purchase that cheat software sheets
software it varies how much it costs but
you know one report was saying it's
anywhere from ten to fourteen ten to
fourteen great British pounds so it's
not a lot but I mean if thousands of
thousands of people are doing this this
could be a multi know into the hundreds
of thousands of of dollars maybe even
Millions considering how many people
play this game so ten cent is hoping to
reduce the number of cheaters obviously
to protect the game itself and to keep
people from flocking I heard in an
article recently actually today that
fortnight is now the biggest battle
royale game in the world I don't know if
it I think it might have surpassed pub G
even even if it's for a short period of
time
two million concurrent players forty
million downloads absolutely insane I
feel like a lot of that is probably
attributed to the fact that there are so
many cheaters in pub G doesn't make the
game fun I have a certain point people
just say you know fingers up and I'm out
but I mean it's got a larger development
team it's made to be a little bit more
accessible in some ways than dub G so
it's a bit more casual friendly from
what I understand I've only played it
like once or twice but seems fun yeah I
like what art style and the fact that
you can build buildings and stuff it
sets it apart a little bit more but
that's it for tech news the the hard hit
hidden hitting articles that we're
talking about today we still have some
hot and heavy hardware coming up but for
now let's just sump in my BC IVC come up
I see where you guys send in pictures of
your rigs and Paul and I talk about him
and tell you what to do with it and tell
you everything that's wrong yep
basically you can count on us to to be
honest with you all your friends
probably come to your house and say oh
that build looks great great those like
your friends nope it's only the guy who
comes in to like nothing sucks they're
lying to you
rebuilding destroy now all right Jacob
r7 Verizon 7 1700 crosshair 6 hero
crackin X 62 cable mod cables LTTE
knocked to a fan Strix 1080 all in a
Corsair air 540 why does it look like
this weathering in this picture great it
looks like this copper the Lighting's
like a copper find the orange lighting
spray that when I crossed there just
orange light but there's orange lights
in this one too it doesn't go Capri it's
just a white balance white balance okay
initially get a real nice color scheme
the the the fans are matching them all
with the motherboard and the memory and
the cable extensions the cable
extensions are a little not quite as
clean as they could be it's interesting
cuz you have some combs going on here
but it's just it's not quite lining up
the way I'd like it to yeah I'd like to
see a little bit a little bit more cable
coming this going on with your 24 pin
and your 8 8 + 4 pin up here as well
maybe just to just clean up clean up a
little bit I mean those are their custom
sleeve cables this is the type of thing
you don't notice if it's just the
standard cables that came with your
power supply when you get custom
sleeve cables though it's more
noticeable when they're actually not as
tidy beyond that you got a couple of
power supplies I'm sorry a couple of
hard drives at the bottom and you know
that's fine they stand out a little bit
to me though that you've got a red and a
green label on the red and green WD and
hard drives just in general or just ugly
I don't think they're inherently ugly
but yeah I think it would be like what
if you did them like a matte black paint
over just over the top of them that mean
it'd be fine see like you can you could
fix him up then they wouldn't be ugly
it's just like how Chrome they are and
just like the weird shape like make them
look sleek just make it look like an SSD
mm-hmm just put like this like make the
frame actually straight and angular and
a little bit more modern I feel like I
feel like hard drives are but like they
came out they been around for so long
that they came out they've existed long
before the
the sexy trend yeah right like let's
make everything in a PC look sexy and so
they're just like brother like the 80
year old guy that's at the the college
party that just hasn't gotten the memo
like whoo are we were supposed to wear
RGB clothes for yeah it's like I'm
getting to yeah finally um your tubing
for your your Kraken X 62 here it's just
I feel like it could be a more pleasant
even even arc you know from where it
from the origin to the destination here
it's gonna serve a little a little
wobble in there plus that's drooping you
got some droop egde and it's actually
touching the top of your graphics card
and I feel like that's a it's a bit of a
no-no there so yeah very nice clean
build over all those there's some things
that can be done here though that would
really really make it make it shine I
concur yes next we've got sir - can sir
- Kane - Kane sane all right
I was his 1080i for the win 3-3 850 pros
and 5820k the nice use deluxe
alright sweet there's the whole setup
there looking pretty clean and to evolve
into evolved case yeah
alright here I wanna see so similar to
the last build we just looked at here is
a situation where you have some nice
sleeved cables and the fact that they're
not perfect they're not they're not all
clean and and like trained and
everything with some combs and there's
something that's standing out the most
to me yeah training those up a little
bit making sure you get you get a nice
smooth arc with that crossover of the
cables and that kind of thing right is
is what I think would stands out to me
the most here and I feel like it's
nearly impossible sometimes when you get
it sleeved excuse me sleeved extensions
that aren't professionally made or
whatever they kind of come like they
already ship sort of bent out of shape
sometimes yeah and it can be it can be
impossible to train them some extensions
are just impossible to get that really
nice show floor look and feel so if
that's what you're craving go with
someone like unsourced or mainframe
customs or
or some other independent you know third
party place that does it all by hand
or you know the cable nod Pro Series
cables that that recently came out
they're actually really nice too yeah
that nice clean look very straight
beyond that you gotta mostly like silver
black white maybe blue LED look going
here I don't know what you can do about
your debug LED but that stands out to me
is clashing with the other LEDs on the
on the case maybe or maybe maybe you can
disable that maybe not it's an asus
board so maybe you can't
and then the RM on the power supply and
the blue or the orange square on the SSD
mmm also don't quite match those are my
really fairly minor though that's pre
painted white that we're yeah maybe
getting all this white would make things
match up a bit though but yeah again
really really solid build overall yeah
that's great so yeah good job thanks you
search you can mix and we got jammie
jammie-jammie with the crosshair six
hero Wi-Fi Verizon 1700 overclocked to
3.8 gigahertz and asus rog Strix gtx
1066 gigabyte model those go for a lot
now g-scale tried an RGB 16 gigs of 3200
speed samsung lasers and a fractal focus
g okay first off I really like your
component choices when it comes to
rebalance your overclocked processor and
Metal Slug graphics card definitely
standing out the most in here just
looking at your list here is gonna be
your raid max power supply I'm not
specifically familiar with the RS 530 SS
but raid max in my experience not
necessarily high-end when it comes to
paralyze is your chalk on the house and
what is this is some weird writing on it
here so new raid max angle and also your
cabling isn't doing any favors here so I
would say a power supply upgrade would
be definitely in the cards for this
system nobody looks a lot maybe
something with with all black cabling to
clean things up a little bit more you'd
have a lot of cable management space
here in the case either so here's also
wear like a modular power supply it
would help you out a little bit because
you wouldn't have quite as much of a
clump of cables down there at the bottom
beyond that you got optical drives I
don't
you remove them cuz I feel like if
they're there you're probably using them
to some degree but maybe masking them or
putting black spray-paint or black tape
around the outside or something like
that might might make those blend in a
little bit more yeah and then finally
you've got some mismatched fans so I'm
not a fan of the blue LED fans you got
in the front here I'd rather they were
just all white and black like your rear
exhaust fan or just something a little
bit more consistent yeah maybe maybe red
that would go at the red black scheme
with the rest of your system uniform
fans are great yeah
again really saw the choices here when
it comes to your internal components and
everything but really Paris black new
Paris play yep that's what we're looking
for Jamie thanks Jamie - - if that's for
the yours core i5 6600 K and Noctua L
965 asus rog Strix z - 7 TI 16 gigs of
Kingston HyperX fury at 2400 and we have
an N case M upon the Corsair SF 600
power supply and not too advanced cool
in case m1 that's a very very tiny
compact case very small and looks like
you've got plenty of airflow going
through it's definitely for your GPU
there I love that cooler nice
interesting that you've got the rear fan
actually is an intake may be used to
help out on your CPU a bit since you're
not really getting much airflow from the
front of your case at all and your GP is
probably eaten up all of the intakes
that it's getting from the bottom of the
case yeah makes sense cable management
for for this case considering the case
is very nice um definitely helps to have
that modular sfx unit it looks like
there's a lot of open area yeah yeah um
I mean honestly like I think just for me
like I don't particularly like the look
of the traditional Noctua fans they're
brown and tan which is a very odd color
combination I'll never really understand
why they went that route but um you know
if you're happy with a shirt I would
personally probably get some black ones
or spray paint them black that I'd be
kind of a fun project because you have
so many of them in your case I'm just
sort of like you know take the blade off
and
masks come off of tape and just sort of
go to town with some some nice paint
it's not to be black I mean it could be
any color besides brown and tan and it
would probably look better than it does
IMO there's a sticker on your to be like
a fan cable it's probably enough to a
not to a fan cable thank you on of the
just above your GPU resistors that they
include said lowered the fan speed could
be that um don't like it remove the
sticker if you can and yeah I mean it's
a really tiny case there's not much else
to really grabbed about here but overall
looks really nice yeah oh yeah there's a
top-down view - I agree this there's not
much to be said here part from you know
changing the color of the fans but when
you have all Noctua fans like that
they're really nice fans so yeah yeah
that may or may not be worth your while
but really nice build there yeah alright
simply silicon has FX 8350 billable to
1080 ti-83 50 and a 1080i 16 gigs random
650 watt press but any hard drives to us
as much all right now some serious
bottlenecking yeah you're definitely not
getting all the performance possible out
of your 1080i since these pair was then
8350 this would be a very very solid
potential upgrade to Rison horizon 2 in
your future that's what I'm seeing for
you and his GPU changes it's a wind
force in a lot of the pictures and then
it's something completely different in
the good quality picture alright so the
1080 TI apparently is new was added to
this builds because it looks like
there's a wind force in older pictures
that is probably not at any what's
gained 18 he's been a pallet or I don't
know I'm not sure hard to say
not not a side label that I'm familiar
with there because like employers my
occurrence you yeah that's what I'm
saying maybe maybe palette or something
like that um alright your cable
management's leaves a lot to be desired
you've got a lot of cables kind of
wrapped around your your tubing for your
clothes look cooler up here which just
doesn't look that good
I guess I'd rather that then they were
just out and loose
because slightly better airflow I
suppose but really getting rid of those
and tightening them up around tucking
them away wherever you can would be a
good idea your power supply has the
ketchup and mustard cables which we
often frown upon here so some extensions
might might solve your issues they're
also just generally speaking you've got
a lot of cable out here and about like
try to plug in your plug and then route
the cable to the nearest cable routing
area and then you know you want minimal
cable yeah actually pick up the slack
quite literally grab the slack and bring
it back underneath the power supply
shroud or back behind the motherboard
tray or anything like that that will
help tidy things up a lot or other than
that though I mean everything looks
pretty decent far as a color scheme I
don't even mind your RGB lights when
they're on and on display here because
everything else is pretty much black so
you know it doesn't look too terrible
but yeah it just needs some cable
management redone and I would say
definitely consider a core upgrade to
your CPU motherboard memory because that
1080i it can do it can do more for you
than what it is doing now
yeah that's been confirmed many times
most def and you're very lucky that CPU
pricing is really really good right yeah
you've already got the finitude CI so
you've already got the most expensive
part that everyone's getting realize
that the CPU should be a piece of cake
yeah all right I think that's the last
one yep that's it so thank you all for
submitting stuff to pay my PC we'll be
back again next week or the week after
that let's move on to hot and heavy
hardware I'm here for last segment for
today
cherry announced some some sweet
switches their new MX low profile or GB
key switches this is an article from
hexxus dotnet I didn't have a chance to
stop by the cherry sweet or booth at CES
I believe that they were showing off
these new switches there so so it's new
to me this is news to me I was able to
test these at the cooler master suite I
did yes I did Lisa :
and clicked it and they feel good its
clicky they feel good overall the switch
height has been reduced by about a third
going from about eighteen point five
millilitres to just eleven point nine
with the low-profile switches the width
and depth have also been reduced
slightly not quite as much cherry says
these new switches will offer the same
perfect operation feeling that Cherry's
conventional switches have already
established as a gold standard on the
market so yeah they're saying no no
compromises here other than you're just
getting a more low-profile more compact
switch there we're only talking about
all the information I'm about to give
you right now is only talking about the
low profile red switches other colors
will be coming out later but this is all
pertaining to the red switches actuation
force and actuation point are nearly the
same as their conventional switches the
key travel the amount of distance that
the key goes down before it bottoms out
has been reduced from 4.0 millimetres to
3.2 50 million keystrokes with no loss
in quality I still get an MX stem so you
could replace you know swapped out for
your own custom key caps and things like
that
custom key cap sets cherry says one
additional benefit here is you actually
had a shorter bounce time for higher
switching frequencies so basically the
amount of time that the switch takes to
go back up from when it's bottomed out
has been reduced so if you want to like
mash something really quickly
potentially do it a lot faster on one of
these low profile switches so that's
kind of cool gamers who are really into
pressing keys fast will benefit most
probably and while this is gonna be yeah
this is actually nice because it's gonna
be good for laptops right we're actually
gonna be able to get gaming laptops that
have mechanical switches in them that
don't force you to have really thick
bodies because like companies like msi
and a couple others have made gaming
keyboards with the mechanical keyboards
in them we can't gaming laptops with the
chemical keyboards but they're super
thick because they're actually full-size
MX switches
whereas now you'll probably get to get
something like a little bit more like
Chiclets style it's a bit more
low-profile maybe not quite then but
definitely thinner than the regular
switches and that'll be nice we'll still
get the nice
I'll feel which is great but screw
laptops why not just get a full desktop
size keyboard with these low profile
switches as well which is why we're also
going to talk about duckies new keyboard
that they've been teasing which is their
blade err mechanical keyboard using
these seeming seemingly using the the MX
low-profile red switches that we just
talked about thin it is super thin sexy
has RGB lighting obviously 20 to 22
millimeters thick with with both USB
type-c and bluetooth connectivity ah
that's kind of cool I think the
Bluetooth really factors into the whole
portability aspect right if you wanted
to take this on the go with you to a
land party or something like that a
friend's house it's slim lighter than a
conventional keyboard and you also don't
have to bring a cable along with you
which is great yeah and if you just
wanted zero absolute little as little as
little late latency as possible I really
like this trend of going to to type-c
USB type-c I think that's great like
actually I like having the option
because blue Bluetooth isn't gonna be as
responsive exactly or something like
that great it's not ideal if you're
grabbing it to take and you know you
have a laptop you wanna do some work on
the go or something or you you know that
that that makes more sense
yeah but having the option like oh
exactly I want to play some games plug
in the USB cord yep
go ahead again yeah that's cool it's
also nice as a fail-safe right it's like
you plan to use Bluetooth and I don't
know you your friends computer doesn't
have bluetooth after all at least you
can still wire it up or vice versa
you forgot your USB cable are your
friends to you here is like some
knockoff and has a green green tooth or
something
Mac Mac in their green tooth county so
double Schottky caps more resistant to
wear and tear than they're painted laser
etched counterparts with more back light
shining through or clearly it's got a
ten keyless design also furthering the
portability feature and yeah that's
pretty much it
no no pricing or availability for now
but it sounds cool moving on
crucial is starting to ship their full
MX 500s SD line this actually happened
while we were at CES I didn't
I don't even know if crucial had a sweet
or a booth there but they did release
their one terabyte model from this line
before CES as kind of like a way to sort
of like promote and sort of generate
buzz around the new line of of SSDs
their AMX 500 series but during CES they
actually rolled out their 500 gig 250
501 I'm sorry two terabyte models but
those are all two and a half inch form
factor they also have MDOT two variants
but those only go up to one terabyte so
if you're looking for a 2 terabyte m2m X
500 doesn't exist only it goes up to one
terabyte there but you know the one
terabyte model was tested by Tom's
hardware which is where we have the
article from here and it was proven to
be quite quite a good performer actually
it actually had the highest four
kilobyte kilobyte random read
performance at qf one that the company
that the journalist has ever tested over
a SATA bus which is pretty impressive
especially when you consider that it's
only two hundred fifty nine dollars for
a one terabyte SSD it's actually really
good that's like a Black Friday deal but
it's just it's just the regular deal or
it's like a regular deal a year ago all
right exactly
so true and it's featuring the new
micron 64 layer three dean and so you
get vertically stacked NAND very
efficient $80 for the 250 gig model
that's too cheap as well 140 for the 500
gig and even the 2 terabyte is still
reasonable at $500 so I know like the MX
200 and 300 and stuff they were also
very cheap but there were some some
gripes about the performance here it
seems like crucial has sort of fixed
some of those issues and now we're
getting a pretty decently priced and
performing drive that is one of the few
competitors to the everlasting 850 Evo
from Samsung that's just been like the
tried-and-true go to sort of budget
oriented but really reliable and
decently fast SSD you've got options
you can go DMX 510 always saying also
saying that the the WD blue 3d SSD is is
a contender in that in that tier so good
good to have options nice to see that
while GPUs and memory are failing at
least some some of your parts in your
piece you're doing well and the pricing
and performance Department price to
perform only can make in GPU out of and
this GP runs unnamed and then and then
SSDs become expensive um last article
here for hot and heavy hardware I
actually talked about this in a CES
video didn't give any views though
because you know event coverage and
stuff but I thought it was one of the
coolest things that I saw actually
because I'm a portable freak I love
things that are smaller form factor than
they should be
and it's also a lot of Technology built
into it this is a AC uses 4k OLED HDR
supported PQ 22 you see display article
originally it's Ramanan in tech and the
display itself is 21 point 6 inches so
it's not going to be a daily driver it's
not something that you're going to use
24/7 at home you're probably gonna want
something bigger but if you're on the go
whether your workstation professional
working professional with like 3d CAD
whatever or color correction and he'll
that involves color because this thing
has an amazing color gamut coverage
covering 99% of the DCI p3 color space
and HDR 10 support so it's got a very
wide cast very wide area with one point
zero seven billion display colors the
panel itself if you were wondering the
actual panel is by Joe LED which I just
heard for the first time at CES which is
a joint venture between Sony and
Panasonic oh and they have pretty good
panels okay I mean at least Sony know
Sony has some really good displays and
stuff their TVs are great
Panasonic I guess supposedly as well but
Joe Lloyd is is a new a new panel maker
that we should be aware of now so that's
that's interesting the panel itself is
60 Hertz with a point one millisecond
response time very good that's super
fast and as I mentioned it's super
portable so the case itself the care
case can act as a stand or you can buy
the hard stand that you see here in the
picture which also gives you some a
little bit of height and some tilt
functionality or adjustment USB type-c
and micro HDMI can be found on on the
side doesn't hurt it doesn't send what
to stand there it does not come with a
stand it's sold separately that's right
and we're not sure how much that's gonna
cost
nor are we sure how much the monitors
gonna cost I I'm estimating around a
grand for something like this portable
monitors in general like high
performance portable monitors are
expensive I have a 15 inch IPS display
that's like nothing fancy it's just a 15
inch IPS you know six milliseconds
response time and it was like three
hundred and fifty dollars from like a
not super super well-known brand G chic
but it had like it was the only moderate
I could find that was 1920 by 1080 IPS
that size and had a actually had a micro
HDMI out as opposed to just micro USB or
something like that so they're not cheap
these portable displays you you end up
paying quite a bit for that for being
able to squeeze all that technology into
a small form-factor but I'll be sure to
keep my eyes out for that I think it
might be cool to try gaming on it to
just see what that's like really
response times good yeah exactly
response time and you know 60 60 Hertz
isn't amazing it's not the cream of the
crop but it is it's 4k OLED it should
you're 10
come on I'm happy to see OLED yeah
definitely being more they're not just a
prototype
yeah so that's gonna conclude it for my
articles we can go ahead and dive into
some of your doom
nations new juicy bastards let's start
off with Fred rant with the $20 Fred I
still think the pie in the face was
better than the cork the cork is
mightier than the pie as some wise man
never said who knows New Year wonder
what I have planned for you this year
Kyle do you have like a very easy this
Fred has like a saw vibe going on right
yeah like I saw like I'm like I want to
play a game like fuck you know I
care how much you donate I don't want
anymore pies in the place last time last
time that happened and why see sauce
threw a pie in my face
blueberries got all over the floor for a
brand new studio and now those
blueberries teens will never come out
thanks a lot Fred you know what you know
what you know how much you know how
she's gonna cost to remove those
blueberry stains more than $100 you
donated for that prank to be pulled so
yeah she's saying Fred owes you money
gotta up your ante that's it
but there was one left over from my half
by Joe Tom louia as 250 of some currency
I'm one gigabit per second for 300
gigabytes for thirty one dollars per
month he's from India
all those rubies rupees yeah that's
pretty good
hell yeah I'm just gonna fight and I
don't like if you have a cap though
gigabit per second
oh that's great and everything but you
have tap it and then that sucks that's
true yeah at least a bit neutrality
that's true and it's pretty Derrick boon
$5.00 did you check out the BMW booth at
CES if so did you do the drifting no and
no no no I'm not good enough with cars
and we were invited to the BMW booth I
don't know I don't know if you have to
be over a million subscribers or you
have to be in with the I don't know
there's that level of tech youtuber
where you start to get invited to the
the things outside of necessarily yes
usually it's like the biggest companies
like Samsung events and like car events
and stuff like that yeah but I don't
care about that stuff I don't even want
to go yeah it's just stupid it's very
much stupid let me invite it don't be
like $5 oh my god you're hearing me I
would see us you too Jerry
everyone is live now saw Kyle and some
remixes yesterday have to catch the
first half later CES was a whirlwind
pretty quick chaos and it was fun and we
get to see people that we love
do lots of work and make lots of videos
drink a lot I drink I drink a lot
no I only drink honestly I drink the
least amount of the CS
I didn't drink much at all I drink so
much more it has to see it
fmz getting old gonna go drinking and
I'm gonna party like no I want to edit
yeah editing sounds good didn't get work
done yeah Kyle Smith Neal Smith name
five dollars thank you thank you guys
for being the best love the show what's
your favorite Sierra Nevada beer xoxo
from Chico Council with you to Pale Ales
solid paleo or the idea that torpedos
pretty good too
yeah always a good a good go-to yes
hearing about is good press performance
there automatic Matt five dollars come
on Paul please finish the htpc before I
graduate AIT and may I'm hoping that
graphics cards prices go back to normal
soon - please PC overlords yeah we all
do and Paul will die by may I should be
able to make some progress hi May
yeah that's the keyword being made it's
good well I may make some progress
yeah I get more and more aggressive
every time I read one of those comments
by Darwin those were the New Year
Fitness resolution get to it
I started 2017 with a 135 pounds squat
an interview with a 275 pounds asked to
grass squat just do it what's that mean
ass to grass means you smoke when you
smoke a joint that's being held in place
by someone's butt butthole nice ass to
grass gotta be strong or you're smoking
the joint through your butt through your
chocolate star by the way it's
impressive it requires a lot of core
strength I do man good job TV thanks
graduations I know cheapen I like squats
Dennis show dollars I dare you to give
away any / all of the obviously unused
GPUs over Paul's head to current live
viewers
no cuz then what will I put there I at
least have the decency to put only like
dead and really outdated GPUs in my back
spin-orbit well what else are you gonna
do with him and they dead
just dark and disturbing dead no one
watch Balaji gonna put them on display
that's what I hope happens tonight that
you know better than Logan pulse my body
they're looking Paul exposing dead GPS
your videos for beers clearly for views
harsh uh dingo on my 40 dingo 5 dolla
love awesome hardware lots of emojis I
like I like the capital if you count as
emojis are the would those be emoticons
emoticons sure I don't I don't know the
difference bro I like them though they
say I'm posting his emoji or emoticon of
a cat they can't win I was pretty cool
ok that's cool like yay cats Joe Jenko
with the $10 donation he says he's from
he's from Jupiter Florida the Jupiter is
not the Jupiter sound is not a thing
sorry Paul Wow
you know old you know Joe I feel bad for
you you're so ignorant of your own local
geography but Google Maps knows better
than I would I would I would postulate
that if you go to Google Maps and you
type in Jupiter sound as I just did you
get sound tree entertainment sound tree
which is in st. Jupiter Florida
it sounds like but Jupiter sound floor
it so you got type Jupiter sound and
then the little drop-down Cupid to sound
Florida and it points right at this body
of water where the Indian River empties
apparently into the Atlantic Ocean he's
lying
there's nothing there it's just it's
just lying inside of Jupiter Island
blank white screen on his laptop I just
mean heck Lake he's all dissolved
gibberish he's making shit up so the
Indian River becomes the Jupiter sound
and these were actually watching porn
night Joe I I'm glad that you've learned
some file out about wave born it's not
at all true that's completely false I
it's kind of look at it kind of softcore
hey Austin girl ski with a $5 donation
says welcome back my Tuesdays are
complete again bars are too complete
also may or may not have watched ten
minutes of site a before figuring out it
wasn't life that that also happens from
time to time it's so we're so in the
moments we lied to you it's difficult to
tell you get interesting Juan Guerrero I
don't think this is JJ this is a another
one Guerrero with the $20 donation
enjoying the stream while gaming I did I
did tweet Kyle my handle is horn Kazama
so Kyle you have to go playing video
games with with one now that next time I
play video games would not be for
another tweeted your handle a couple
weeks alright thanks for it's a day
appreciate that donation thank you we
know Sal do see some loot Cellucci five
dollars I would like to buy five dollars
worth of bit Juan please seriously
though I feel like I made a mistake when
I bought my mastercase pro six what do
you think why would you say that yeah
person 806 oh well you might have miss
out it sells sells got a mastercase pro
six didn't aren't they dropping the
price for it possibly I mean you gotta
you gotta look at it this way they're
always gonna be new products arrow is
gonna be updated products that come out
that ya might modify things or ship
things or make things slightly better so
ya figure when you get a case like this
it's gonna last you two to five years
depending on how frequently upgrade and
that's perfectly fine and it's a solid
case so don't be upset about it owning
yeah
own it man freakin own it and I meant
hit up sell cuz he's got one of those
two you guys can make the club yeah and
mastercase pro six Club fires were great
clothes no I'm just kidding evocative
productions $10 donation he says
donation one all I was hoping to run
into guys at CES would have made an
otherwise boring CES more interesting
wanted to invite you guys out to the
range to literally shoot the shit I've
been to the shooting range in Vegas last
time I was there that's shot some guns
that was entertaining sorry we missed
you at sea
I seem to have missed a lot of people at
CES but I never went to the show floor
and yeah it was a shorter trip for me
than usual so I didn't see quite as much
but hopefully next time and if we do
then maybe you can take us to the range
you know he has a follow-up a second $10
donation do you guys know what the hell
is up with PC hardware stuff being
spread out all different private hotel
suites is here
I live here didn't feel like during the
entire strip that's how it always is
that's normal that's very it's very
normal
CES really sucks when it comes to
especially the PC hardware yeah because
yeah they're all out in Suites at
different hotels yeah it like Venetian
Palazzo or Caesars or a Bellagio or a
Trump Tower and it's not separate from
the actual yep main show location and
it's all pain in the ass to get to and
parking sucks now on the strip because
we also the places charge for parking
down it's stupid yep and I did valet the
whole time cuz I have you know I drew my
car whatever and like some of the hotels
you get lucky because it's free valet
but others like you're there for 45
minutes for one vendor Andres 20 bucks
ever since MGM switched it's like at
least $12 for parking everywhere
yeah well I mean there's a few places
that aren't but a lot of places since
MGM did it and all their properties
there get on the same route and so
erases yeah even the Caesars Caesars
just always my think their MGM to but I
I don't even know hmm but Caesars as
well it's like there's a nice self Park
at Caesars but it cost money now yeah
anyway thank you for your donations and
next up is Fred ranting five dollars up
a minute
I'd like to I'd like to put some money
on your gig and have a pie thrown in
your face I think Fred does a regular
live show that you could say no isn't
isn't that fair it's kind of a one-way
street here it really is yes it is if I
could do productions with another $5
donation part3 give up the good work PS
good catch sugar video Kyle actually
incredibly informative a lot of people
are saying that best videos I'm like am
I in the wrong industry which is more
you should random tech just exclusively
reviewed or
later boxes just things I have to do is
shit haha rapid-fire 56 of the five
dollar donation hey guys wanted to thank
you both very amazing videos an
inspiration to build build my first PC
also thanks for teaching me how Kyle you
got it's always good to know how to grow
up Kyle's very good teacher of letting
you know how you should Kyle to guess
you taught me how to build a PC this guy
oh yes thank you Paul teaching me so I
could teach him I didn't teach you how
to Kyle Lou teach me how to cow is that
as a latest trendy dance move that's
should it's replacing Jackson I need any
day now john zakian $5 would a risin 7
1800 X and crossfire 584 gigs be a good
combo that's what I was striving for
before the bitcoin invasion 5 80s 4 gigs
or a gigs are really really overpriced
right now so it's hard to tell you
exactly in here it all depends on
whether you're about to buy these cards
or whether you already have them if you
already have right then sure that's fine
combo if you're about to buy them I
would say don't because in and all of
the overpriced graphics cards right now
the AMD cards are probably among the
worst so it's hard it's hard to say you
got to keep your eye on inventory and
wait for stuff to come in and be
available at close to MSRP and then kind
of pick your poison yeah I would agree
with that yeah Shane smart with five
dollar donation no comment Thank You
Shane not very smart for donating five
dollars and even smarter for not
commenting yep I Hurley 1989 20 bucks
hey guys I just made a Twitter just to
send you a pic of my PC I think that's
your PC my dick I learned everything by
watching YouTube built by build my first
PC it's a 1950 X awesome choice can you
tell me what you think don't be kind
yeah I mean Semitic dog that my PC next
week and and will definitely not be kind
indeed but yeah congrats on the new bill
wishbone $5 do you think CD Projekt RED
cyberpunk 2077 77
will push modern GPUs that are
affordable like a 570 to 580 since
others are way overpriced at the moment
Projekt RED is the same developer as
Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and
that sort of thing so I would imagine
that they're trying to push the
boundaries for you know graphically
awesome textures and stuff that's not to
say that their game won't be scalable
GTA 5 can look absolutely beautiful but
it's a super scalable game so even if
you have like a ten fifty to fifty TI
you can dump down the settings quite a
bit and actually make it playable it
just won't look as pretty so it's just a
matter of how they're gonna develop it
how granular the the quality settings in
that game will be I remember that
Witcher 3 was very PC forward obviously
so it had a lot of a lot of control on
you know various settings and stuff that
you could mess with to get the framerate
that you were looking for so I wouldn't
quote myself on it but I think you could
be ok with something like a gtx 1060 to
play that game he said a 572 587 your
Friday and then yeah same answer there
yeah exactly so here's how like might
have to adjust the settings or play at a
lower resolution but yeah most games
that come out right now with that kinda
graphics card you can play a 1080 no
problem red red $5 she says but your
wife loved hitting you with the pie and
I sense that what really counts and
isn't that what really can't isn't that
what really counts
um know what my wife enjoys does not
matter no I shouldn't say that that was
horrible that'll be forever on the
internet now uh no you're right you're
right you're right but she gets plenty
of enjoyment out of other things that
don't pertain me getting pies in the
face
so um I will strive to keep her
entertained with those things and not
the pie in the face things
alright that's all I got Michael
shrewder $5 hey guys hey you guys are
great
I was wondering in the cooler master
suite was there any more on the master
box cube I did not get too much info on
that so I would not be able to tell you
I did the base model is gonna be 40
bucks so it's pretty cheap it's a little
micro ATX case looks like a pretty solid
couple the textured pattern on the
console the one with the top and the
hand side but there's also panels that
you can add on tops and everything and
then the i/o thing you can you can
rotate to put on the bottom or the front
to the top of the side so it seems like
a pretty flexible case I need to get
into it and builds in it to like give
you a little bit more depth as far as
like quality yeah it's a yeah
yeah as far as internal quality and Bill
Claude and everything but it seems like
the base model for 40 bucks seems like a
pretty solid be pretty solid choice yeah
um well cool guys I think about pretty
much oh Matthews from Matthew strum $5
Paul shirt is discriminative
discriminatory against Red Dragons well
