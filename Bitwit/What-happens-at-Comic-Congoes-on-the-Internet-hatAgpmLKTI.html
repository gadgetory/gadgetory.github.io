one of the main reasons why I'm even
here at Comicon in the first place is
because Brian who is the organizer and
founder of San Diego land invited me to
his epic land party here on the
comic-con show floor just so I could
tour around this is actually the first
plan room that comic-con has ever had so
it's kind of history in the making
all right day one of the con I guess it
was half a day at the con is over and
we're at CBS now because I forgot some
Walgreen sorry forgive me because I
forgot something very important that you
should never forget at any convention

we were at yesterday can't wait to meet
some of you guys so just walk in and
came across Fernando what he's wearing
literally the best shirt oh gee it's my
childhood statue you are I don't know
why but I can never get that tan look in
good alien have you been eating line
line for line for peanuts
you guys can buy those like literally
anywhere at this moment I have
officially lost call it Steve I have no
idea where they went
I kind of feel like a little kid who's
just lost their parents at a grocery
store
I think I'm panicking oh I think I found
him yes
I found him hey I was so scared I lost
you why did you leave us I didn't mean
to you why did you we were no no I'm
your child when wifey sauce is in here
so
more peanut lines what kind of peanuts
are these all right so anyone who knew
anything playing the Pokemon games knew
that you should definitely choose
squirtle starting out he was clearly the
best starting Pokemon out of the three
and I stand by that statement till this
very day water for the win nice better
cheap they're both pretty bad you both
lose Paul you should you should really
recycle that bottle there's a recycle
bin right here Paul
so for some reason I agreed to be a part
of this to man call a duty 4 modern
warfare tournament with Steve we're
we're just gonna embarrass ourselves I
hope you know that every fun
one dude both you guys might have
already guessed this but we tweeted um
make it to the final round mainly my
fault because I suck at video games
Steve's actually a pretty darn good
gamer so I'm gonna take the fall for
this one but I got really excited the
first round that we won because I
thought that was the whole tournament I
thought that was it but it was fun
though you know actually you know for
being Comic Con and all this land area
is pretty filled in like most of the
computers are in use even like the
vendor booths are pretty bumping all but
for for old Microsoft over there I think
it's I think it's updating right now

quick stop Paul actually looked up the
Twitter account of the Pacific Surfliner
that were on says local authorities have
closed rail tracks one mile north of
Oceanside to investigate a trespasser
incident we're expecting lengthy delays
as a result then they updated 16 minutes
ago tracks are still closed and delays
are expected to be lengthy we're on
train 573 that's us FML is this FML
still a relevant acronym in today's
culture okay we're going to be holding
here until the dispatcher releases us

alright more things that call is found
on Twitter about our situation

who is trespassing on the tracks Kaito

Twitter indicating that they are stuck
on their train the coroner has to come
and do an investigation and they're on
Camp Pendleton property right now wow

rails

if it's like things are pretty much
clearing up and we should be able to get
to our destination without any further
delays so I might actually be able to
