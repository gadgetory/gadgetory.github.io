awesomesauce news I wasn't expecting you
guys but hey look there's a there's an
ultra-wide monitor right here I guess
I'll just do a video on this this is
LG's 29 a 9 321 by 9 aspect ratio
monitor and it's that's perfect I guess
you know I'm not really ready to do an
unboxing or an overview or review of
this thing quite yet I don't even know
how it got here but I do hear that even
though it is an IPS panel it still has
like a 5 millisecond great a great
response time or something like that so
theoretically it should be pretty decent
with gaming performance I would assume
but I don't even know how I would really
game on this my video cards kind of
acting funny with whoa what are they
what what are these things these are
just two GTX Titans on my desk what this
is craziness so I guess I'll just
install these Titans and just try to see
if I can play any games on this thing
cool
all right guys I'm all booted up I've
got the two gtx Titans nestled safely in
my case i've got steam loaded up here
I'm going to try Borderlands 2 it's
gonna be my first specimen for today um
let's see if it supports 2560 by 1080
all right
applied I'm wearing headphones by the
way I don't know if that makes a
difference to you guys but just so I can
hear my enemies where they're coming
from so I don't look like a total noob
while playing in front of you guys so
let's do it let's just go straight into
Fink slaughterhouse this is by the way
where I do my benchmarking when I
benchmark cards with Borderlands 2 ooh
this is this is cool Wow you know you
don't notice it very much when you just
stand still when you move around you
actually I don't know it seems to take
it in a lot more look at that I can see
I can see the ammo dump and and Fink at
the same time from this close see I
could I couldn't do that before before
would be like it'd be like that but I
don't know I'm going alright let's just
get into it
buzzards income
whoa whoa didn't expect them to blow up
that fast ah ah yes Oh ugly you know
what guys this is pretty insane I
actually I don't think this is really
giving me an advantage the the
widescreen aspect ratio it's not really
giving me an advantage as far as being
able to see enemies on my sides to a
certain degree yes but my peripheral
vision isn't that great anyway so I feel
like I'm still seeing you know enemies
about as fast as I would with a sixteen
by nine ratio monitor but what I didn't
expect is that this this aspect ratio
actually makes the game a little bit
more immersive much more immersive
actually because all I'm seeing is the
game itself I'm not seeing the speakers
to the sides of my monitor I'm not
seeing any of the wall that's behind my
monitor all I'm seeing is the in-game
action I'm not used to it I'm not even
sitting very close to the monitor and
it's just it's actually really cool I
didn't expect this to be the one thing
that stood out to me when testing out
this monitor but seems to be the case so
this has been Borderlands 2 once again
very very cool result so far I'm gonna
jump into another game after I kill this
guy rod alright guys so I decided the
next game I'll be playing or testing out
in this little experiment here will be
Crysis 3 as you can see I am already
running at 2560 by 1080 native
resolution oh you know what I am running
to effing Titans right now so I'm gonna
turn this all the way up yeah
Oh feels good Oh feels so good oh my I
just got goose bumps dude advanced hey
hey this is bad because now I'm not
going to want to go back to a TN panel
after
after playing on an IPS Bert for for
today because this just looks so much
nicer just the color depth in everything
oh wow God don't zoom in alright let's
let's go down Oh four different unarmed
room oh I was just in time before I
cracked my skull open and by the way
having two Titans is awesome Oh take it
look at the blue the water
II he lead me to death psycho dumb just
looks absolutely stunning beautiful
beautiful I'm having a nerdgasm guys
this is what an orgasm must feel like
this is pretty cool guys so yes Crysis 3
looks awesome especially with the two
Titans definitely at giving me a heavy
bias for playing this game on this panel
but once again just that I really like
the wide aspect ratio
everything looks super perfect it's
running absolutely smoothly good stuff
alright so I'm gonna play some
Assassin's Creed 3 now see this nice
cinematic nope just cinematics not a 21
by 9 so I don't care
skipping it let's get the cinematic wait
this isn't 21 by 9 this doesn't look
right hold on well it says 2560 by 1080
but it's showing me something else super
lame so I guess that would be my other
critique with this resolution is that
not all games support that resolution
and that's that's pretty obvious right
but it still is something to consider if
you're thinking about getting a new
monitor because you're not going to be
able to play all your games widescreen
like I have been so far today this is a
prime example it's a new game it's
fairly recent you'd think it might have
the the support for it but it doesn't
and that's okay I mean it still looks
great it's still the IPS you still get
all the features of an IPS panel you
just might be disappointed because you
can because you can't quite run all of
your favorite games at that awesome
resolution
alright guys now I know I said the
beginning of this video that I was just
going to do some gaming but I just
couldn't help myself I've opened up
Premiere Pro I feel like if I were to
purchase a monitor I would definitely
consider how optimal it would be for
video editing this is plenty of room for
me to edit on the timeline here this is
really why I'm saving the space to the
left here my desktop is so that I can
have an explorer window if I need to add
like a piece of music I can just go into
my assets and go to music and then I can
just drag and drop straight into
premiere and boom there it is
but if you want my honest opinion I'm
still a little bit on the fence as to
whether or not I would go for something
like this like a single 21 by 9 panel or
two 16 by 9 or 16 by 10 panel
side-by-side if I was doing a majority
of content creation just because it's a
little bit easier to segregate Windows I
feel with with 2 panels but I also like
the fact that I can do this which is
something that I could never do with a 2
panel side-by-side I mean I could but
there need a Phat bezel right in the
middle and it would just look really
ugly and it'd be really nasty to edit on
the timeline in that configuration
I know let me bring up some web pages
here let me bring up some web pages look
at that I can quickly snap one window to
one side of the monitor and I'll quickly
snap the other window to the other side
look at this like full web browsing like
I don't have to
there's no scrollbar that opens up on
the bottom so I don't have to scroll
side-to-side I can see everything
perfectly I mean even when you cut this
monitor into you're still getting what
is that 1280 by 1080 which is perfectly
fine for web browsing but there you go I
can easily browse the web on one page
here and you know for instance view a
video on the other page again I give you
five videos in half of one of these
monitors to be honest it's pretty
ridiculous
alright guys well there you have it that
is going to conclude the gaming
experiment as well as a couple other
applications that I've tested on this
particular panel from LG this is the 29
ei 9 3 that's correct the 29 ei 93
21 by 9 aspect ratio 25 by 60 by 1080
resolution monitor IPS panel minds you
but I like it I personally like it for
gaming I think it's awesome it really
sucked me into the whole immersion of
the game just because it was all I could
see and I like I said I wasn't even
sitting very close to the monitor I
actually had to be leaning back further
than I usually was so I wasn't getting
my face in the camera shop as you saw I
was trying to play Assassin's Creed 3
with it and it wasn't really working out
but for the games that it did work out
on looked awesome for gaming I actually
prefer a single panel as opposed to
three panels side-by-side just because I
hate those two bezels they just totally
take me out of the game as far as
content creation goes like I said still
undecided whether or not I like it I'd
have to play around with it a little bit
more just to see you know if I would
choose this over two panels side by side
because I use two panel side by side at
work and so I do have some bias there
I'm pretty used to that setup um but
aside from that you know oh there you go
I suggest trying it out I don't know how
you would try it out unless you bought
one but there you guys have it that's
what those are my opinions my humble
opinions on this brand-new monitor from
LG so you guys enjoyed the video
subscribe to awesomesauce news if you
haven't already you do the whole like
thing and I'll see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
