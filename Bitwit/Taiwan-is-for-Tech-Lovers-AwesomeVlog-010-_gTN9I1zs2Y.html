country and once again we find ourselves
at this restaurant we were here last
time we actually went twice last year
because it was so good if you're not
familiar with in Tai Fung it's a
dumpling place they make the most
delicious soup dumplings ever which are
pretty much these little pork and
vegetable dumplings that have like
literally like soup in them so you have
to be careful that you don't burn your
mouth off when you bite into them in
this way we feast these of the gods
we each get our own yeah we literally
ordered one per person so this is mine
goodbye little dumplings you were you're
cute while you lasted get in my bed II

now we're at the Guang quoi digital
district it's a six floor building and
every floor is littered with tech stores
they sell everything from motherboards
to video cards USB flash drives video
games I mean everything is here it's
pretty ridiculous we're gonna go to the
top floor right now cuz that's right
here

offering 100% compatibility 8gig
chocolate chips he-hey so Paul and I
just bought some LEDs for dirt cheap
these are like four or five bucks a pop
I got two these double with purple ones
purple LEDs are kind of rare in America
so that I would stock up on those and I
got one double white LED Paul got he got
he got a variety of cones would you get
ball I got a couple so I still have some
left
last year some I'm good on glues I have
still quite a few blues left I think
think I might be done like one way so I
got a couple more Reds a couple more
weights and then I got a purple as well
kind of kind of like kind of like a
because it's the color of royalty this
one's a double so it's got this one has
more LEDs on it so it gives kind of a
more the more uniform lighted mist and
you were looking for greens for like a
while and the guy had no green shape
that greens down here cuz apparently
maybe invidia bills are just that
popular yes and greens are harder to
come by come by so if you're wondering
who knows how to do water cooling the
best definitely Taiwan I think that
means water closet no it's definitely
water cooling well okay
he's cool in it but it's better beer and
cooling well it was water at some point

the leaf or this is the leaf she picked
it right off the plant super fresh and
then that's like kind of creamy gooey
sauce that is tangy and sweet and
delicious it's kind of tomatoey and it's
a bit spicy but not too much it's just a
belen sauce it's a once-off at steak
