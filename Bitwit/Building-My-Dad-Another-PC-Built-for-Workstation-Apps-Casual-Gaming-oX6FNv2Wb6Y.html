awesomesauce Network today I've got a
little bit of a project for y'all it's
just a simple PC build for my lovely
father actually wait didn't you already
build him a computer like a month or two
ago Kyle yes I did but here's what
happened all right I built him a
computer it's really nice it still kicks
ass he likes it a lot but then like a
week or two after that my mom's laptop
started dying on her just started
crashing it's a Sony it's a laptop that
explains everything so basically she
doesn't have a working system anymore
and my dad had the idea that he would
donate the computer I just gave to him
to my mom and that I could build him
another one so I was I'm totally cool
with that because it means I get to
build another system yay this one is
going to be actually more powerful than
the one that I've given them initially
so that's kind of exciting but why don't
we take a look at some of the components
here first off well before we do that
here's a look at his old system we are
going to be reusing some of the parts
from here including the 500 gig Samsung
hard drive as well as the optical drive
it is a combo Drive my dad insisted that
an optical drive be in there just in
case he needs it so we're gonna be using
that scrapping the rest while I wouldn't
say scrapping I'm probably gonna do
something with that CPU I don't know
maybe make a little server I don't know
let me know what I should do with the
CPU so back to the parts first off let's
start the CPU I wanted my dad to have a
really fast quad-core CPU so we've got a
4690 here it is a non case Q it is
locked because my dad does not know how
to overclock nor does he intend to learn
how to so I didn't really see the point
in paying the extra premium for an
unlock SKU but that's going to go right
in tandem with this H 81 m DG Fon OD GSR
2.0 hate this text this type font is
horrible you can't tell if it's an O or
0 or an S I'm getting off-topic but it's
an as rock board it's micro ATX no need
to go z97 because we're not overclocking
we don't really need that ability so
might as well save some cash there for
graphics I'm kind of skipping on the
graphics this is a 660ti my dad isn't a
huge gamer he's not really looking to
get into it too much he plays like one
or two games currently that aren't
really graphics intensive at all but I
just wanted to throw this in there this
is probably way o P for his needs but
still again this is going to be a
workstation bill
he's really gonna need that processing
power over the graphics power but it's
also P&amp;amp;Y
she mentioned that eight gigs of ram
again if he does decide to get into
gaming now that he can with that video
card I've given him eight generous gigs
of 1600 megahertz vengeance low profile
memory kit from Corsair very nice as
well as a crucial BX 100 SSD 250 gig
this is going to be his operating system
and programs Drive and as I said before
we're gonna be using that hard drive for
all his files and data and things like
that and last but not least we've got a
silverstone PS 0-8 I think it's PS 0-8
maybe it's PSO eight at least it's not
POS eight that would be really
unfortunate for Silverstone's marketing
team to call the POS 8 case anyway I'm
getting off topic again I'm just gonna
go ahead and shut up right now and we're
gonna start building this thing and oh
my gosh I drink too much coffee this
morning
you
all right and here is our finished bit
oh wait nope there we go
all right so overall the build went
pretty smoothly I will admit that there
were a few complications which I'll get
to in just a moment but first off I
wanted to give a little bit of rationale
as to why I chose this case among the
hundreds of other cases in this price
point I think it's around forty fifty
fifty or sixty bucks but first off the
dimensions were spot-on for what we were
looking for for to fit in my dad's
little cubby space where he keeps his
desktop underneath his desk so there
weren't too many options there for this
one managed to fit with just enough room
to provide about an inch on either side
between the system and his cubby also
the i/o is actually on the front panel
it's not a top or on the left or right
which makes it really accessible it kind
of wouldn't have worked at all had it
been anywhere else other than the very
front so that's not the reason I went
with this case additionally it's got
some kind of unique features for a very
budget case including a fully black
painted interior and another nifty
feature of this case is that it actually
does feature a removable dust filter
look at that huh yeah not bad
Silverstone there's also a 120
millimeter fan right here at the front
intake included it's a fairly silence
the only issue is that when you put
these side or the filter back on becomes
a bit more audible just because the air
is brushing or passing through the
demand that kind of creates a little bit
of ambient noise but it's not too bad
overall now on to some of the hiccups
here so you see how we've got USB 3 at
the front here that's great good job
Kyle good thinking
but wait where's the USB 3.0 2010 header
on the motherboard oh there is none way
to go Kyle I spoke too soon so yeah I
picked up motherboard that didn't have a
20 pin USB 3 header so I actually can't
take advantage of these two front ports
fortunately I bought an adapter it's on
its way right now in the mail from
Amazon it's a male 20 pin two USB type-a
she has it splits off into two type A
connectors and you plug it in right here
you can route it out through the the
punch-out hole behind the case and just
plug in those two type-a connectors into
those two USB 3.0 ports right there and
magically they become pass-through ports
and then you can once again use these
ports of the front table it's really up
to my dad if he wants to do that but I'm
pretty sure that would make more sense
than the not as he's not really going to
be accessing the back of this case much
at all of this build much at all
once it's in his cubby so I think that
adapter will work out just fine for him
the other hiccup that I ran into was the
actual CPU cooler you can see I've got a
stock seat CPU cooler here from Intel
which is what I introduced at the
beginning of this video but that wasn't
the original plan initially I had
convinced my dad to pick up a hyper 212
Evo unfortunately I was unable to
actually fit that cooler in here I
didn't happen to check the clearance
parameters of this case so it was
sticking out maybe the top of the
heatsink was sticking out like a
centimeter or two I did try mounting it
and the side panel just wouldn't fit on
so we've resorted back to the Intel
stock cooler which is okay for now again
lock skews not gonna be doing any
overclocking the only benefit of that
hyper 212 Evo would be the cooler temps
of course and also a bit more silent
operation as the Intel stock cooler can
get a bit noisy when it's under load but
for the most part cable management was I
mean I did the best I could honestly
there wasn't much that could be done as
there's very limited room behind the
motherboard tray to around some of those
cables you probably saw from the
time-lapse video but I was able to get
some of the unused power supply cables
behind there as they were fairly thin so
that wasn't wasn't too much of a problem
but for the most parts I enjoyed
building this computer and I hope you
enjoyed watching me build it
I also did some benchmarks just because
just because why not right I figured
maybe this this has a video card in it
so maybe you guys want to see some
gaming benchmarks I didn't go too crazy
these are just some some really basic
vlog benchmarks let me go ahead and turn
the aperture jeez these cars passing by
ridiculous but here we've got three
games that I just benchmarked about half
an hour ago hitman absolution at high
settings with 2x msaa got an average of
52 frames per second with a minimum of
44 Bioshock
infinite ultra settings with diffusion
average 64 with a minimum of 18 and
lastly I tested GTA 5 the the benchmark
there with a blend a nice blend of
normal and high settings and 2x msaa
enabled still yielded about 60 frames
per second on average with a minimum of
22 temps are looking pretty good with
the max CPU at 67 and 78 for our 660ti
so overall job well done me uh yeah now
I'm gonna go ahead and pack this thing
up shut it down and give it to my dad
again yes he gets two computers in like
one month he's a lucky guy but that is
going to conclude it for this video guys
thank you all for staying tuned and
watching please toss me a like on this
video if you enjoyed it leave me some
love down below in the comments and I
will see you guys in the next video
adios
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
