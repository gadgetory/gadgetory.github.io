be quiet is finally here with a modular
design for ultimate flexibility silent
wings 3 140 millimeter pwm fans
outstanding water cooling support and so
much more the white edition is available
in limited quantities so catch it before
it's gone you can learn more by clicking
the link in the description below what's
going on guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well I
have been waiting for this video for a
long time this project has been in the
works for several months believe it or
not and it's finally coming to fruition
I'm super excited this is actually a
collaboration between me and fantex or
fantex and I so they have provided a lot
of this hardware so huge shout to them
for making this possible we are gonna be
building the most epic custom
water-cooled system that I have ever
built inside of their in Thule chassis
which I guess isn't saying much because
I've only built two custom water-cooled
systems ever but the system we're gonna
be building over the next couple weeks
is going to trounce both of those by a
friggin landslide and the point of all
this the purpose of this system is to
really showcase the pinnacle of top-end
hardware that can be had here in 2017
this is about as good as it gets if
you're if money is really no object
because we are gonna be assembling a
more or less about a ten thousand dollar
PC by the end of all of this so it
should be very exciting I'm super
excited you should be excited - I hope
you're mentally prepared for the shit
that's about to go down it's gonna be
glorious on that note let's quickly go
over our list of hardware here because
there's a lot to cover once again
starting with the enthu elite from
fantex this is a beast of a case guys it
has the most custom water cooling and
radiator support of any case I've ever
worked with personally and we're gonna
be utilizing it pretty much to its
fullest potential today it does have
support for a dual system you could do a
dual system in this case however we're
not going to be doing that for this
particular build I know a lot of you
guys are probably gonna be upset with me
about that but rest assured we are gonna
forego that option in place of more
radiators more water cooling hardware to
lower our thermals even further so very
excited to be using this case of course
it looks absolutely fantastic all lit up
and stuff if you've never seen it but
more on that later additionally our CPU
of choice maybe you guys are probably
curious as to what platform
I've decided to include with this
particular bill I'm going sky like X
guys I'm going for the most cores and
most threads on Intel's high-end desktop
platform we've got the core i9 79 80 X
II which is an 18 core 36 thread monster
now there is a question to delete or not
to do live do you want me to deliver
this and perhaps apply some liquid metal
as the folks over at gamers Nexus have
done in order to reduce the thermals
that much more it's a risk that I might
be willing to take if there's enough
interest of course I don't think we'll
need to but it might still be cool just
toodle it and go through that process
for this build now of course a two
thousand dollar eighteen core CPU
deserves to be mounted in a worthy
motherboard and I feel like there is no
motherboard more worthy than the ROG
rampage six extreme that we have here
from Asus I fell in love with this board
as soon as I saw it at Computex this
year the RGB implementation that asus
has done underneath this sort of trans
translucent plating is absolutely
stunning to look at when it's all
powered up and stuff and there's just a
ton of connectivity we're gonna be
mounting some MDOT two drives to this
guy there's plenty of features here that
I do not even feel equipped to read off
right now because they're just so many
this box comes with like a thousand
accessories hopefully it's a good
overclocker as well I can't imagine why
it wouldn't be of course we're gonna see
exactly how far we can push our 79 ATX
here but that's of course for a later
video as well and we will be pairing
that motherboard and CPU with this
amazing ddr4 kit from g.skill I have to
give a huge shout out to those guys
because they actually hooked it up with
not a 32 not a 64 but a 128 gigabyte kit
of their tried nzr GB ddr4 at 32 hundred
megahertz guys this is incredible this
kit is blazing fast and we've got eight
16 gigabyte sticks in here to fully
populate all the DIMM slots on our
rampage 6 extreme it's gonna be pretty
badass so Thank You G skill for hooking
it up there additionally we've got
graphics cards well right now we only
have one but rest assured the second one
is on its way we've got the Strix GTX
1080p i/o see from Asus thank you ACS
for providing these the cooler is
amazing out of the box which is why I'm
sort of a bittersweet moment where I'm
gonna actually have to
move the already robust cooler and
replace it with a fancy water block but
I'm sure I'll get over it pretty quickly
so that's gonna be pretty sweet two of
these in SLI is again almost as good as
it gets unless you're talking maybe a
Titan XP an SLI or something like that
but for the most part it's gonna kick
major ass additionally we've got power
supply enter max plateau max DF Platinum
it's an 80 plus Platinum modular unit
fully modular with just a super high
rated efficiency of course the 1200 watt
units can be able to power everything in
our system it's gonna DF switch on the
back so during operation you can hit
that switch the fan will actually
reverse and kick off any of the dust
that's accumulated on the fan to keep it
clean and the sleep cables are actually
gorgeous they've got like sort of a
white speckle thing going on but
unfortunately won't be able to see them
because we're gonna be using custom
tables now storage is the other thing
that we don't have on hand just yet
we're still waiting on some m2 drives
from Samsung those are gonna be some 960
pros capacities of either 500 or 1
terabyte maybe we can get a 2 terabyte
stick in here that would be pretty sweet
but of course we're probably gonna have
one for boot and then the other for mass
storage and games and things like that
those are of course some of the fastest
m2 drives you can buy on the market
right now which makes them a perfect fit
for this bill moving on now to our
expansive list of custom water-cooling
Hardware fan Tech's have hooked it up
with their Glacier Series C 350 I this
is a CPU water block for Intel LGA 2011
or 2060 6 or 1150 whatever sockets and
this water block is super sexy
it has RGB lighting which can sync up
with Asus Ora MSI mystic light etc it
looks fantastic at first I was like I
don't know if I like it because I'm so
used to seeing ek water blocks on
everything these days but the more I
look at this and the more I work with
this the more I fall in love with it
it's really grown on me just the overall
aesthetic and it looks very well
machined super sturdy additionally we're
gonna be using fan Texas glacier series
water blocks for the GPUs they've got
Strix Edition water blocks for our cards
here for our 1080p is also glacier
series super nice-looking blocks also
have RGB implementation that can sync up
with various software's now not all of
our custom water cooling Hardware today
is from fan text mind you we do have
some stuff from good ol ek water blah
including their x3 250 millimeter
reservoir this is just just a standard
acrylic tube reservoir very popular
option among the custom water cooling
community this is this does not have a
pump of course so I actually have a pump
on its way right now
also from ek the model number escapes me
at the moment but rest assured that
we'll be pairing very nicely with this
guy and radiators radiators up the
friggin yin-yang look at this we've got
to EXCI three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiators from ek two of them
okay but that's not all we also have two
more 420 millimeter radiators these are
the C II series from ek water blocks all
four of these radiators will be fitting
inside of the end two elite by the end
of this little build log here we are
radiating with radiators ladies and
gentlemen we are pretty much filling up
every orifice of the end through Elite
with custom water cooling hardware to
get temps as low as possible and
hopefully get a system as quiet as
possible too so if you guys think again
if this is overkill it certainly is and
finally we've got fittings we've got
tons of fittings once again from fantex
I can't show up to you guys right now
but there's probably there's probably
looks several several dozen fittings in
here all shapes and sizes they are gonna
be hard line fittings of course we're
going to be using PT G hard line tubing
this stuff is branded by this is monsoon
I've never worked with this brand before
all the other stuff on performance pcs
comm was sold out
this had a fairly good rating and seemed
like a good clear ptg options so we're
gonna be bending with this I don't know
if we're gonna get around to bending
tubes today but certainly soon enough
alright guys so there you have all the
parts that we're gonna be using for this
system with the exception of the
radiator fans I actually haven't picked
out fans yet I don't know what what I
want yet but hopefully by part 2 we can
get that all ironed out if you guys
couldn't tell by now this is gonna be a
heavily RGB friendly system I mean we've
got RGB on the water blocks the
motherboard the RAM etc so we're gonna
have a lot of flexibility once this is
all said and done to play around in the
software and Asus or or what have you
and kind of just customized a bunch of
different lighting profiles and so forth
so it's gonna be super exciting I'm
to start building but before we actually
get anything inside of the case itself I
mean the last thing we want is to build
inside of the end through elite fire it
up with all the custom water cooling
hardware and find out that something's
defective and we have to undo all of our
hard work so what we're gonna do first
is a test boot outside of the case just
to ensure that all of our core
components are working properly and then
we can continue on with building inside
of the case sound good all right three
two what
alright y'all so without much effort at
all we've assembled our test build
outside of the case we're ready to boot
or at least try booting we've got
surface mounted power button on the
motherboard I'm gonna go ahead and fire
that up motherboard LEDs were turning on
just fine and looks like we've got LEDs
to our ddr4 modules ah oh there we go
splash screen success get into that BIOS
up stupid message from the monitor hey
test boot success yes very lovely
alright beautiful
yay everything's looking good okay looks
like we've got a core idle temp of 33
degrees Celsius on our core i9 which
seems pretty normal and it's showing up
it looks like two of our DIMM slots are
not registering with the modules here
although I suspect once we set up XMP
it'll register just fine but I think we
can call this a successful test boot
ladies and gentlemen and we are ready to
go on to our next steps which include
mounting the GPU blocks onto the
graphics card so we actually do have
only one GPU right now we're still
waiting on the other one as I mentioned
and we still need to test that one
before we now it'll water walk to that
but this one's good to go and I've used
this card several times in the past so I
think we are ready to start mounting
that block to this GPU and perhaps also
we'll get around to mounting the CPU
block onto our core I 9 let's go ahead
and do that now
alright waterblock has been mounted
looks fantastic on top of our GP 102
look at that this thing is heavy
this thing weighs a ton but looks sexy
AF bruh you can see we've got our RGB
cable hanging off here we have a couple
options for this we could connect it to
the case directly there's a built in RGB
controller inside of the n2 elites or we
can connect it to the 50/50 header on
our motherboard actually as I'm sure
there's probably more than one on the
rampage six extreme or we could even
connect it to the card itself if you
guys remember the Strix 10 ABT i
actually has an RGB header right on the
PCB so we could do that too
clearly we've got plenty of options but
we'll have to circle back to that in
part two because we are all out of time
for today I really wanted to get some of
the hardware installed into the chassis
in this part one video but lo and behold
I don't have any fans for the radiator
so I don't know exactly how far I would
get anyway and plus I am just short on
time so we're gonna have to do that in
part two part two I'm sure will will
actually start doing some two bending
and get our runs figured out and it
should be glorious so thank you guys so
much for tuning in be sure to leave any
comments questions or concerns of yours
in the comments below and feel free to
toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it it helps a lot guys thank you
so much subscribe to the channel for
more tech stuff coming at you really
soon
including the rest of this beautiful
series and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
