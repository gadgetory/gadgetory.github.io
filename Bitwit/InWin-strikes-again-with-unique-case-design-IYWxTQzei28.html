to you by fantex and cable mock click
the links in the description below for
more info all right in win let's talk
about inland anyone was cool because
they were actually on the show floor I
got to go to the convention center and
stuff and get out of the hotels for for
a moment there but um in when usually
has like a new case or two at their at
their CES booth I mean it's usually like
a high-end tower that you know costs a
lot of money and usually has some cool
neat weird features that may or may not
be useful so let's take a look at at one
such tower there 905 this is the first
time they've unveiled it to my knowledge
it's got aluminum construction very
curvy front end rear panels they're sort
of symmetrical I guess on on either end
and it looks it looks interesting I
don't know let me know what you guys
think about the aesthetic here according
to in when the front fans are supposed
to get its intake from the bottom and it
looks pretty tight though like I don't
know it doesn't look like any air is
getting through there at all so maybe
I'm missing something or this might just
not be a great performer
in the airflow Department now the rear
panel is kind of interesting because
it's got these large cutouts so that you
can reroute cables through but those
cutouts aren't big enough for you to
actually stick your hand in there unless
you're you know a little kid or
something like that to actually plug
things in and unplug them from your rear
i/o so there's actually two thumb screws
on the side that you can remove and that
will allow you to sort of remove the
rear panel and access all those ports
but it just seems kind of a pain in the
butt if you ask me additionally we've
got a button that pops open the top
panel for ventilation it's automatic so
it's electric it automatically goes up
and down depending on whether you turn
the system on or shut it down actually
if you shut the system down it'll leave
the vent open for a short period of time
just to let some of the hot air exhaust
out of the case which is a really nice
feature it automatically will obviously
go up once you power the system on if
that's your preference it will remember
that for the next time you boot and it's
got addressable LEDs of course because
why not there's a tool list tempered
glass side panel which can be removed
with a safety catch so it doesn't
actually fall out and shatter all over
the place it'll just kind of sit there
and wait for you to fully take it off
and put it somewhere safe there are no
fans included with this guy because I
guess the idea here is that enthusiasts
who are spending X amount on a case like
this are gonna want to go in and add
their own fans and radiators anyway it
makes sense there's also a 360 radiator
that can be put at the front or the top
of the case both simultaneously and the
top actually is sort of segregated
there's like a top chamber really for
your fans and radiators that will
isolate them from the rest of system
it's kind of interesting you get a power
supply chamber that underneath houses
for three and a half inch or two and a
half inch trays you can mount you to
drive to to any of those there's also
for two and a half inch drive trays
located behind the motherboard tray that
are held in place with single thumb
screws so very easy to access and and
install I didn't quite catch the
availability or pricing of this case but
based on all the features and the
construction and what we've seen from in
win cases like this in the past this is
definitely going to be well let's just
say it won't be cheap but it's simply
the a1 is their next case we actually
got a glimpse of this or an earlier
version of this at Computex last year
it's a mini ITX case but it can house
full-size components like a full-length
GPU or even like a CPU cooler Tower for
example the front panel has a power
button dual USB 3 and audio jacks
interestingly enough we get a tempered
glass top panel and there's two models
here one that's just a tempered glass
panel and another one that actually has
an integrated wireless Qi charger so you
can pretty much charge any supported Qi
supported device wirelessly that's super
cool retailing for 139 for the non Qi
version and 159 for having that Qi
wireless technology built-in so kind of
a steep price for a mini ITX case but
also some interesting features we also
get a tempered glass side panel with the
toolless sort of push pin pool pen
removal it's actually really cute it's
very is the most adorable tempered glass
side panel I've ever seen we get
included included
600 watt power supply that's 80 plus
bronze certified and 600 watts is enough
power to drive pretty much any main
desktop a graphics card on the market so
that is splendid
we also have an RGB LED strip that's
sort of located in the transparent base
it's kind of interesting
which can connect to any RGB header on
your motherboard for example you can
control it through ace
or a sink in maasai mystic light or srgb
Fusion etc or if you don't have an RGB
header on your motherboard sadface it
will default to red so hope you like red
also no fans are included in this case
either however you get a 120 mount at
the back of the case one on the side
kind of it towards the front to the
right of them where the motherboard is
mounted and to 120 mounts at the bottom
actually located underneath the GPU
which I'm glad they focused on air flow
for the for the graphics card in a case
that's that's sort of like rocking this
design otherwise it could get pretty
toasty in there for our sad little card
there's also a removable mesh dust
filter down there so you can take it out
and clean it to any time it gets dirty I
should also point out that apart from
having a chi or a non chi supported
model you can also get this case in
either black or white so there's a bit
of options there a few options there for
your personal preference and that's
pretty much it I have no idea when this
case comes out some point later this
year I forgot to ask or I don't remember
or whatever but be on the lookout for it
soon now let me know what you think of
the 9 1 5 as well in the comments below
