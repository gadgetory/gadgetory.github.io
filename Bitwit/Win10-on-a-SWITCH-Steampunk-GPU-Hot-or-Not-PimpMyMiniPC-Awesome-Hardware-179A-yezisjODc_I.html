we are now streaming to both twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware as well as my
youtube channel youtube.com slash big
wit welcome this is awesome hardware
episode 179 I feel like we've been in
the 70s for a while because we've had a
lot of like you know miss tweaks and
stuff just cuz we've been both busy and
stuff yeah but but we're getting through
it
179 holy moly it is March the 5th and
thank you for joining us this is a tech
live tech show that Paul and I do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware and our respective YouTube
channels it's split into two halves this
week it's on the first side a is on my
half or side a is on my channel and the
second half will be on Paul's channel
which you can find a link for in the
description below if you're watching on
youtube or you can go to youtube.com
slash Paul's Hardware we also like to
have some drinks on the show in fact we
have some some pretty nice bottles today
yeah this is the abyss it's a very sad
old cow brought these I brought these
and brought these for Paul this is sort
of a premature congratulatory gift and
premature premature congratulation yes
yes yes it is I was embarrassing when
that happened I would know all about
that it's called the abyss from
Deschutes Brewery and they're both
stouts this one's aged in tequila
barrels and that one's aged in a bourbon
barrels like rum rum rum barrels that's
right so these these are these are fancy
bottles I just picked the most expensive
stouts I could find at BevMo thanks oh
thanks cap hopefully they're good
you're welcome Paul you've earned it as
well as nearly 1 million subscribers
which is a good time to bring up the
fact that you're almost at 1 million
subscribers and if you haven't
subscribed to Paul yet on youtube
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware
subscribe to him so that we can hit a
million subscribers during this stream
we're only gonna be streaming for maybe
1 to 2 hours tonight maybe 2 and a half
who knows but if we can get to 1 million
that would be pretty epic
that's it cool you can pop bottles as I
mentioned it's not expected by the way I
mean based on the you know the the
subscribe subscriber growth rate you
know it probably won't happen it would
only be like a special act of people
just reading the word or something like
that for it actually to happened so so
spread the word it's basically well yes
if you can if not it'll happen you know
within the next day which I'm totally
cool with you're like the most patient
person and you're like edging out of my
seat like everyone subscribe ten years
Kyle
muted gotcha
that's not what you start we
occasionally use adult language on the
show also intended about to be like so
how'd you hide your kids ten
years spent Kyle is what I was about to
say they're what ten years of what does
I've been doing YouTube you haven't been
doing it for ten years
yeah she go back to New Age Oh count the
new egg days well I kind of do new the
new egg channel built up to four hundred
K you know while I was there if you're
adding new eggs subscribers and you hit
a million while ago yeah but that's not
that's not how that works
fortunately and anyway it's been a long
time since since Paul's hat is you know
we're getting some good jumps right now
we are holy crap that's beautiful and
you know full thank you people we can't
thank you all can't stop anywhere from
creating fake accounts or whatever and
subscribing twice but that being said
it'd be really cool if if we actually
spread the word throughout your own
social media venues and encourage people
to subscribe very much like the
PewDiePie PewDiePie a trend phenomenon I
actually started hashtagging subscribe
or sub to Paul D PI so let's get sub to
Paul D PI trending on Twitter can we see
that on the Left column let's do it
we're already in our yeah we are getting
some nice growth here so guys continue
subscribing continue spreading the word
as we go about with today's live stream
thank you for joining us on this very
very special evening let's see what else
let's say I'm just gonna skip the the
the the the stores cuz we got some stuff
to talk about and I want to jump into
gaming at the end of this let's start
with the the games Hardware report that
vivid a bit of a spin on the original
segment we're talking about video gaming
hardware as the segment name suggests
starting with the Xbox 1s all digital
edition unit the console yes
talking about a console come your tits
everyone but this is kind of interesting
this is from hot hardware this article
but everyone's been talking about it of
course thank you very much Paul look at
how rich and yeah there's like all
exclude oh this is the the rum barrel
right yeah and this is room one this is
13 over 13 percent it is it's this a
strong strong beer here drink
responsibly everyone can choose that's
good it's good it's complex I can't I
can't explain it right now I need time
to think about it mmm like gasoline
gourmet gas wow we just jumped up
another oh wow you guys are awesome dude
you my beautiful
everyone please prove have a chance here
Briana's Bates's grandma just subbed why
don't you Dan thank you Dan tell your
grandma thing to all the grandmas up
there big shadows keep killing it to
your gran but we appreciate it it's just
it just keeps climbing all right so the
Xbox one asks all digital meaning that
there's no disc reader it has no optical
drive anymore at least this new version
that they're calling their code naming
maverick xbox maverick but the official
name according to the windows central
report will be Xbox 1s all digital
edition so no optical drive pre-orders
begin mid-april right around the corner
with global available availability the
following month should be cheaper than
existing Xbox one esses because there's
less Hardware so at least it's not one
of those things where it's like they're
removing a audio jack but charging you
more for it on a phone or something like
that you bring this down the bomb
actually might be cheaper as well my
question is will it be slimmer that's
what I want to know is if you're
removing the optical drive now obviously
that's I'm going to take up a whole lot
of space but it would be kind of cool if
there was an even more portable version
of the Xbox one s it doesn't seem like
too much of an ask yeah the amount of
space you lose from an optical drive
right and you know they could probably
just make further optimizations to the
chassis to bring down the overall leader
capacity but time will tell guys that is
the first article for the games Hardware
report sorry I didn't get around to
making a custom lower thirds for that
but we can move on we have lots of other
customization in today's episode this is
true next up we have a hacker got a
ticker
damn ticker ticker from my heart my man
I've got a bum heart
we overclocked 3d net sent us this
article they didn't send it to us but we
went on their website and found it has
enough been a hacker installing Windows
10 on a Nintendo switch now this is this
is kind of interesting it's actually a
pretty impressive feat because it's this
console is using nvidia tegra SOC which
is not an x86 processor which is
required for Windows tend to run on
effectively so it's it's pretty
impressive that the guy got this to work
although the article states that the
operating system doesn't really boot
properly so maybe in time we'll actually
get to the desktop and be able to do fun
things like play minesweeper around your
switch but yeah this is just sort of a
work in progress from some some guys
some hacker his name is in bushwa on
twitter and he's he's known for hacking
things and I don't know I guess this is
this is not maybe one of those most
practical hacks that we've seen but it's
just kind of cool to see how people can
manipulate Hardware and do it and make
it do things that it otherwise isn't
intended for the other thing is that the
Nintendo switch Hardware might not be
capable of running Windows 10 very
smoothly it does does require some
system resources as a lot of us know and
the Nintendo switch is very much
optimized to do one thing not so much
run a full fledged x86 operating system
so yeah this is just kind of one of
those fun hey look look what I did type
of moments I figured it was worth
mentioning any benchmarks oh yeah that'd
be interested if you overclock it like
to see the fire strike Ultra scores on
this one buddy duty water cool it clean
water cool and overclock the switch that
it's probably coming up next he's
probably working on it as we speak
that's my further record gamers Nexus
for the record we've broken the 700 mark
we're at 999 727 and you people are
amazing guys are monsters this is I have
to f2 also constantly I'm just gonna
constantly just remind chat and any
newcomers who might have popped in that
we are trying to get Paul to 1 million
subscribers during this stream we're on
the road to one mill road road to one
and as soon as we hit it on streem if we
do we'll do something crazy yeah we
totally normally didn't think about his
low expectations here it'll just be a
cool moment isn't that good enough much
isn't that good enough like it'll be
cool much like the charity stream back
in December right out of the gate yeah I
was just like pouring in the love was
poured in so this is yes this is amazing
absolutely I'm gonna tweet show I love
it
all right so our next article here is
from PC gamer comm who better to get the
news from for the games Hardware report
segment and this is about a it's
actually about a prebuilt PC we don't
talk about pre bolts too often but this
one seems interesting enough to mention
it's the sky sky tech Archangel Elite PC
which I've never heard of sky tech
before what's interesting is that this
system is that apparently sold at
Walmart but it's not a Walmart PC
otherwise it would be an overpowered
branded gaming PC this is just simply a
seller that that has one of their
products being sold by the Walmart
retailers so it's it's given by Sky Tech
it's gonna be selling for eight hundred
and ninety nine dollars it's actually
two hundred dollars off its MSRP making
it quite a steal especially because it
features an AMD risin 526 hundred and in
RTX 2016 no mention of what board
partner is is providing that card but be
kind of interesting to check out further
also something unique about this
pre-built is that it has pre managed
cables so that's already a step up over
the overpowered gaming PC the dtw one
that I took a look at looks like the old
NZXT
skies starting the trooper started to
see him stormtrooper it kind of does
look like an NZ little bit a little bit
it's missing the window for the anyway
yeah no no you definitely read about
that oh look at that oh okay it's so we
can confirm I just needed to look it up
on their website because I'm gonna click
the link in the article click a link in
there Clark I think we actually ripe
rare for the occasion Jesus
we have a ZOTAC twenty-sixth a single
stick of memory okay from team group we
also have definitely not a good
motherboard it's something we got to
DIMM slots so we could be suffering from
the same situation what was the h3 ten I
think on unfortunate on dtw one so yeah
it's not looking promising but again
either look at that white look at those
Wi-Fi attached oh look at this look at
the sound solution on the motherboard
there we got as robust to get stereo out
you have six USB three though as
compared to two on Walmart overpowered
still not great but just yes he has two
ports for your mouse and your keyboard
cat I mean for the I haven't seen a ps2
port in in years you still see a ps2
ports here and there oh here oh don't
don't do that
I haven't I mean I have doing no but a
cable this guy oh no it's probably not
an important cables uh-huh down here I
didn't unplug anything that that crucial
my it's my hundred pound Mastiff pitbull
mix he's like come fight me No thank you
you win
hey so ok
it doesn't look there are definitely
some shortcomings right off the bat that
we can see here but if you're looking at
the core components rise in five 2600
and our TX 2060 for $8.99 I should
mention that this is also a bundle price
so you actually get you get your pick of
battlefield 5 or anthem according to
reviews battlefield 5 is the one you
should go with but to each their own PC
gamer actually calculated similar parts
the similar parts that they found in
this build on Newegg and it came out to
925 bucks so about 25 dollars more than
what this pre-built is going for that's
not a huge difference it is it is
cheaper if you go with the pre-built but
it I'm also unsure what parts PC gamer
went with and if you're looking for
deals you could probably get it for
around the same price or even cheaper so
I don't know maybe pass on this one you
guys let us know
alright moving on to our next segment
this is also a new one that I didn't
have time or care to make a lower thirds
for it's called hot or not hot or not
and the concept is very simple we take a
thing either a product or a game or
person and we decide for ourselves
between us is it hot or not and of
course we have strong poles so that you
guys get to choose as well let's make it
interactive hell yeah so our first
subject judgment here is colorful eye
game g-force r-tx 28 ET i coudn't
the code on steampunk inspired gaming we
do have a large thirds for yes or no oh
okay we have them no second god yes or
no before which that is true is probably
very different from this second together
so we're gonna go with that but that's
all you say you were just change the
text and even the pictures they would
would still still yeah work yeah we got
thumbs up guy and thumbs down yay
zuckerberg on the left i don't know
first iran they're probably the first
images that came up when you google
image search thumbs up wait i'm dropping
frames apparently i'm dropping frames
but you're not Delgado's doing paul get
a mic wanting to call it that they'll
get to know cuz i watched you a couple
jack jack black videos alright so what
would this is a hot so it's a steampunk
inspired video car yeah that rendered
image is very hard to tell like what it
looks like in person thank yuri this is
also watermark this red part right here
that's not spray-painted on in that
exact configuration okay so it's
water-cooled as you can see it's
actually using a net a io comes with a
matching radiator with fans which you
apparently they just call this a 360 and
using the third fan position for this
configuration why do they need this much
space for whatever's going on there I
guess the pumps probably there right
yeah yeah but stumps probably got to be
there yeah I guess that's still that's a
substantial radiators size you got it
right take any consideration so you can
see the back things numbered that's
that's number well yeah they got number
one sexy metal backplate for the top
players so it's a hybrid air and liquid
cooler so it probably water cools the
GPU air cools the erm
maybe the memory okay so yeah it's a
steampunk thing I'm trying to think you
know I was trying to think of what would
even match with this like if you could
go really thematic with its steampunk I
think those uh those Tai Chi
motherboards from asrock might might be
a good cuz it's got that gear print on
it its steampunk but it's it's like
you'd it's a spray painting
it's like high-end steampunk it's like
steampunk if you're the king or whatever
you know you and you're gonna have
everything gold-plated it better be
high-end quality because it's it's eight
hundred dollars more than a founders
Edition they're sticking with the button
on the back thing here it's probably the
profiles they've done that before
usually it's like an like a turbo button
there like an OC button makes the whole
Oh everything so large so I guess it
also comes with the water plug did you
see our own underwater what yeah like a
seat Pete no wait what am i this looks
like where's the radiator like these
look like where the tubes would come off
are they I think does it show the
radiator oh that is the race is the
radiator with the fans oh yeah it looks
like the pump included derping right now
so maybe you're also getting like parts
that you can integrate into an open loop
yeah I'd be interested if it's
experience this kind of looks like it's
got maybe G and a quarter fittings on
the end here but then we're tubes maybe
that go to the the alum one that would
be weird that's alright so this is so
how do we figure out if this is hot or
not
well we have a strawpoll that i'm gonna
paste in Chantry Oh unless well thank
you you're the best you love yourself
you think for all of my brain when it
doesn't work properly which is often
thank you um all right as well so hot or
not Paul what do you think 3/8 pin power
connectors by the way I should point
that out like has an LCD screen for I
gotta say not just it's just the Styles
not doing anything for me here like it's
it feels like they've got a lot of
extraneous stuff going on when it comes
to the the aesthetic design yep and
that's not translating to like this is a
very fast graphics card to me also you
gotta bear in mind it's and I
Jake's 2080 I yeah you know those are
all gonna perform within a certain
margin of one another so there's only so
much you can do so I guess with that in
mind the what what what more can they do
besides dress it up all fancy and
whatnot I just I just don't it's an
aesthetic it becomes an aesthetic thing
at that point and I don't like I don't
like the aesthetics here yeah it
definitely does look like I've seen that
the problem with with the aesthetic for
me is that it's so aggressive that you
would you would need to like do some
heavy modifications you'd have to do
some serious mods to a PC in order for
it to really fit or do it justice and
since I'm not really great at modding I
find that intimidating and I'm gonna say
not as well house is not let's see what
you guys thought hot or not colorful tie
game GeForce r-tx 28 et iku done do we
get to vote or just for sure yeah we're
saying that we have a voice not so 5149
very it's very close man oh man so
there's an audience there for the high
end steam punk yeah absolutely
Dan Punk for the 1% maybe sing it in
person might might turn me on a little
bit yeah no no that's also true it
probably could have benefited from some
better pictures yeah yeah looking at
some sense you know build maybe stuff
give us an example but technically right
now we win yeah all right what's next so
we have apex legend apex and we're gonna
we're gonna do hot or not for apex
Legend and this this hot or not segment
comes right on the tail of the
announcement that apex legends already
has 50 million players online in its
first month of launching the sort of a
covert launch operation now has 50
million players for this game that is
absolutely insane so I haven't played an
extensive amount of this game I probably
played under one hour total I haven't
played it basically but but I'm still
gonna say it's hot mainly because 50
million players I mean just if you look
at the facts on paper it's a hot game
it's probably one of the hottest games
right now besides fortnight and also I
like the FPS style I like the fact that
you don't have to build like you do
in fortnight I've always hated that
about
night it never really drew me in but
this is a game that I feel like you know
if I had time I would I could definitely
get into it Paul hot or not
apex legends do not worry I mean you
already said hot David I I I have to
agree with you because they're probably
gonna play apex legends later tonight oh
yeah it would be weird if we said
otherwise that's true hot it's hot I
guess hypocrites so hot right now
alright vote it vote hot okay vote hot
we're voting hot so hot right now this
is awesome oh so hot we've we've got
about a 40% hater rate yeah
drinking that haterade just just below
40% which is 91 people play fort night
yeah or pub G or M remember comfy but
remember remember when that was a game
and anyone ever I don't know still has
millions of players know what hot is
catch and fire though oh it's getting
hotter Oh heat is once you once you
stream once you showed the results
online because it snowballs it's a hot
snowball no taints it cuz then people
are like oh I want I want not to take
over now I'm gonna vote not just so we
can turn the tides on stream and that
could be like I did that but let's go
onto the next one last one here for hot
or not this is a far outside of what we
usually talk about but it is still
considered a piece of tech by most
standards that's the koenigsegg Jesco
rzs co koenigsegg yes myth scope Swedish
I believe so the J's pronounced like a
why it's a 1600 horsepower car with a
blistering 300 miles an hour top speed
there's only 125 units of these being
made and they're each selling for three
million measly dollars they see the
reason why it's called yes go that's
actually to honor kristian von connect
connect cigs Koenigsegg Koenigsegg dad
who the car is named after his Papa Papa
yes Co who's a very successful
businessman himself and I didn't know
this he dumped his and his wife's entire
life savings into his sons
startup
primo cars 20 years ago providing
business advices every turn so this is
sort of in honor of his dad he's like
dad you gave me fifty trillion dollars
to start my own cool car company when I
never shed and now I named one of the
cars after you so totally worth it right
who hasn't who hasn't been there really
it's a story that touches all of us yeah
yeah lollipop once yeah so it was like
this is all I have that's why I that's
why I sympathize so so much and that
that's why I say hot it's very it's very
hot so hot this is hot as the probably
gets hot at 300 miles an hour - uh-huh
is the exhaust no was the engine engine
that the fired by the burning of the ass
it's the fuel Pistons creates in the to
create thrust to the crank okay that
creates so much thrust all right I'll
say some things that makes sense five
litre twin-turbo v8 nine speed light
speed transmission it can skip gears
five and six so it can go from four to
seven you must why even have five and
six what's the point so you can skip
them that's why that's why you have that
that's like why you have to Denny's so
you can say that a good Denny's in the
crappy Denny's why not just make eleven
the highness all right you fifth
gear okay all right let's let's see hot
or not so let's let's see what you guys
thought Thank You self for posting that
in chat we said hot hot oh not I'm gonna
say hot it's so hard I never said Wow
more people like the YESCO than they do
apex legends or colorful like a
steampunk such a universal story that
you know I mean it's nostalgia I would
probably the strings me back to the days
when I just trillions of dollars and
most people I think they're so that's
that's a that's yes or no I'm use I'm
sorry that's hot or not Saturn uh
totally how could I ever completely do
from yes no
unimaginable alright so as we're
finishing up this segment and moving on
to our last one which is pin my PC just
an update Paul
now at nine hundred ninety nine thousand
eight hundred and fifty five subscribers
were already within 150 subs we're just
we're just making light speed records
were faster than X according said yes go
faster than that yes go speeds plus I we
just skipped dears five six seven and
eight
who needs those gears what are they to
ninth gear that's been my philosophy
great to nine maybe that's the
philosophy that got me nine hundred
ninety nine thousand eight hundred and
fifty five eight hundred fifty six
subscribers is just a lesson that you
must have done that while overclocking a
nine hundred nine thousand nine hundred
and ninety XE processor well I mean the
inspiration has to come from somewhere
and when the chip foul on your toe in
Germany you said nein nein nein nein
nein nein while listening to the Beatles
song number nine as you watched the
number nine movie called number nine all
right we're doing a mini hit my PC so
Mini ITX small form-factor this is fun
and they're fun and Q of them engine and
that you've selected as well uh there's
four four is this fortified what do you
want Mike's here Adrian's oh I want you
link to Adrian's it looks like yeah
Adrian ok cool Adrian's good because he
responded to Mike which is alright
okay Adrian SZ with the 6600 K based
system with the gtx 1070 OC 16 gigs of
corsair lpx memory yep Corsair ml 120
and 140 millimeter fans an EVGA 650 G
power supply and a cos B 150 i Wi-Fi
motherboard the define nano s4 the case
and the cooler master am the CM Sidon
sided 40 cited dos that's the Sidon came
and went it did and
you don't see Miranda as often it looks
old well it was from the 1900s
I mean slightly medieval so we got a you
got a mini ITX case you couldn't fit the
whole thing in the in the shot that's
fine this one's oh yeah I guess the top
and bottom you can't quite see the
bottom Wow it's like a dead rat and the
lens centimeter of its clips to me it's
clips off a little bit it's 99% all
right let's all do that aside I think
you've done an excellent job with your
cable management here yeah like I'm you
might say this is the 120 in the back
you could maybe tuck that up and around
possibly but you'd have to do some so
much work for that I'm just saying
single critique but other than that a
good job you know you got them bound up
here with a bit of velcro in the middle
I like that because it's modular you can
undo it
mm-hmm and redo it if you need to pull
those cables off to clean or whatever
yep we're dealing with a bit of a GPU
sag situation indeed seems like you'd
have a a few options for dealing with
that we've seen people put some sort of
a like a figurine or something like that
in there to kind of prop it up you also
certainly pretty close to your graphics
I'm sorry to your power supplies so
maybe something just on top of that to
provide a little bit of support could
even that out in this case it would
actually help
temps maybe to get that those GPU fans
away from the PSU because it looks like
they're resting right up on it you never
know I could that could I'm surprised
your fan even spins gonna be the case
and what ended well yeah while you're at
it take your power supply stickers off
because they don't match the rest of
your system and that's all I had to say
kind of cables anything else dad Cal
custom cables would be nice custom
cables would be nice so they would be a
finishing touch if you want to do a
complete rework of this then a custom
cable job would be good and since you
have a I believe the 650 G that's
actually that's a that's NEX 650 G power
supply those are fine they're you know
they're on the lower end of the EVGA
spectrum but um you could get custom
cables made for that anyway nice little
system though thank you very much thank
you
moving on we have Henry poot Henry Henry
pointed Quinte I say poot because I used
to have a GPS and there's a plenty like
Street to be like left on poot 6,700
cake Corsair h-60 z170 and mini ITX
motherboard from gigabyte 16 gigs of
HyperX fury 21 33 speed ddr4 memory and
EVGA gtx 1080 superclocked samsung 850
Evo SSD Barracuda 2 terabyte hard drive
haha fan text and to evolve mini ITX
case supernova 750 watt power supply 3
Redux fans and so that we got knocked to
a Redux fans in here looking looking
like a an excellent balance between
looks and performance I must say oh yeah
and then we got some some power supply
cables and like Mia is this a fan cable
up here at the top just what are they
just taking a step back for those two
steps forward that you took with the
fans
yeah that's stand out to me here that
you've been rusted rest of the system's
looking real clean apart from the top of
the SSD which could use a bit of a
dusting yeah the SATA cables are hideous
say - where's stay D cable oh really
I don't know they're like they look like
silverfish I've seen those that are kind
of clear and silver and then they're not
the most horrible to me to my eye we
just looks so nice like wood but clean
things up a bit but men yeah your 24-pin
and whatever this yellow and blue cable
is coming up here up around through here
that might even be from the fan itself
in which case you like what I do with
that you can sleeve it and unfortunately
this is one of those boards those mini
ATX motherboards that has the USB 3
header in just such an awkward place
have to route the cables
way around at least in a case like this
and honestly you can do about that
yeah because because it's the only place
that it is like those that blended in to
me because the other stuff stood out
more right as far as needing a bit of
help sure yeah there's not much even
oops but overall very nice power supply
sticker again we've got another NEX
750 B they are supply here but that
stickers not doing you any favors either
oh yeah everything that Paul mentioned
and I pointed out I think you since it's
got loads of potential yes very nice
very nice system there
thank you very much Henry there's
William Joe petty fixes yeah this is his
sister's system he says my sister needs
an upgrade AMD Athlon 200 GE gigabyte
horas be 4 to 4 B 450 i motherboard no
graphics card because it's an Athlon
Twitter GE which is an APU of course
they're 550 watt power supply one
terabyte WD hard drive and ZX NZXT th
200 I case looks ok painfully slow H 200
high costs 130 140 bucks that's a it's a
high-end case given the hardware that's
donating it does look very nice and I
can tell from the system that you have
in the back you know which is Anna Lee
Emily PC 11 mm-hmm you know that you
know what you're doing and that's it
that's a that's a good building hardline
cool system all right so you've also got
like an all-in-one liquid cooler like
you didn't mention that
why so Joey you're silly here you you
you clearly know what you're doing maybe
he already had that and have access to
some decent hardware and threw it in
here so yeah she needs an upgrade you've
got a be 450 i motherboard you could you
could go from this really really
underpowered cpu to something really
nice like a 26 2600 or maybe a 2700 or
2700 X if you really want to go all-in
really with that cooler the deserves are
rising 7 yeah I'm clearly afford things
like that with the nature background and
then give her a graphics card yeah
really good
since there especially she's doing any
gaming you know something balanced with
this obviously we depend on what CPU you
put in there but you know a 16-6 TTI or
a 2060 would be great 20 atti if you
really love your sister um yeah maybe if
if the RX 5 90s are really dropped in
price if that's actually happens and
maybe one of those J just did a build
with my baby was like you gotta feel
like one XD yeah if you're looking for
something more in the cheap bargain said
but nice clean-looking build other than
that aesthetics wise we have I have no
complaints so yeah good thank you very
much mr. Joe next we have gladdened
McClelland I thought it was McLovin at
first disappointing to see McLellan okay
Rison 2600 so we got a resin 5 there in
the EVGA GTX 1080p I very nice supercar
and we have Norris p450 motherboard a
corsair lpx 16 gigs of memory and open
of other steps so looks like we've also
got an NZXT mini ITX case as well very
popular choice and very clean cable
management really I can't knock you for
it even the backside looks pretty tidy
and I love that you have matching case
fans throughout and those are some
seriously great fans that I think are
gonna do loads of favours inside of a
cramped chassis like this one
yes um as far as Flair goes and bling I
would love to see some maybe like black
and white custom extensions you know
just just go all out just just go all
that but before that before you do that
yeah I would even get a cooler for the
CPU yes the first thing you want to
spend money on before anything else is
put man CPU cooler cooling performance
2600 that's a wraith stealth not aspire
yeah you can open up the 2600 and get
better top-end performance and overclock
it a bit too if you want to go that
route by upgrading the cooler so that's
what you should do first sticking a it's
like a 2/4 yo-yo in there
and use those ml fans Oh that'd be sexy
that would be sexy I would bust a nut
just for that probably TMI could do that
but geez apart from that man you've
nailed this get a cooler get some cables
this is show rig material I agree it
looks fantastic
well doesn't say well done and then
finally this is just sort of a narwhal
mentioned for to to Bryce Bryce I
thought as he mentioned in his tweet
that this is kind of I've seen this ring
before and may look familiar this is
actually the rig that meticulous be 67
our good friend and fan and fall were
awesome sent over bandits to give away
to a fan and this is embraced was that
fans I should have this computer out
from Michael - Bryce and he got it and
tweeted us that's awesome it looks like
it's serving him really well it looks
like it's in tip-top shape just so the
way I shipped it out I'm so glad that
it's in that image and shipping because
that would have been my fault but hey
it's it's just a beautiful rig I've
commented and complimented them before
this this piece before when you showed
it to me on the last active swarm it is
just exactly what you'd want to fit into
a damn case everything's super clean
here even a cable management in such a
cramped space is wonderful so that's
awesome grants they sound a wonderful
home Congrats to Bryce
Thank You Bryce all done Congrats mr.
mr. Michael alright that's all for my
half hey hey hey
I kept it 40 minutes it's not terrible

think schedule-wise vine is about to
start and well I just saw it
