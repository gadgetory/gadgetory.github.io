awesomesauce news today I'm very proud
and excited to present to you all the
long-awaited roomate unboxing now this
is a project that I promised you guys
for quite some time now and I'm finally
ready to announce that it is here and
ready to air I don't know if they're
considered new roommates anymore because
I moved into my place in August and
since then you know it's been a couple
months but they're still fresh
they're fresh roommates nonetheless and
hopefully you guys get a kick out of
them and enjoy them as much as I do in a
strictly platonic sense so with that
said let's roll tape why don't we kick
things off with my first roommate this
is a male unit the model name is Brian
and this is the OC gamer edition so many
of you guys will actually like this
model quite a bit measuring it at 6 feet
1 inches and 200 pounds this system
operates within a large full tower
chassis and if you've ever had issues
with high clearance you can definitely
appreciate this elongated form factor
bear in mind however that this unit does
occupy a larger than average footprint
and as any gamer edition tag implies the
system is tailored to handle heavy
gaming workloads at home or on-the-go it
does come factory overclocked but if you
have ample caffeine cooling there's
still some sealing room if you want to
push the system even further being the
power machine that it is it's also
important to note that food consumption
of this rig is well above average
another nifty feature of the system is
that it can also dual boot into both
nerd and jock so you can actually choose
your platform whether you want to watch
the game
or play it comes ready with classic home
defender which is proven to be highly
effective for keeping door-to-door
solicitors at bay other pre-loaded
software includes RPG completionist
version 4.2 and a generous 90 day free
trial of useless knowledge 2013 now the
last thing I'll mention about this
system is that there have been some
reports of it going to sleep
unexpectedly but I have heard some talks
of a microbrew patch that immediately
rectifies the issue moving on to the
next roommate I have here this unit goes
by the codename Jenny it's a female
system and this particular model is the
OCD unicorn Edition whatever that means
this unit features a smaller form factor
chassis with a height of 5 feet and 5
inches and according to the box the
weight of this unit is none of your damn
business
this model too comes factory overclocked
but any attempt to push it further will
likely result in severe damage to
persons of property also the OCD
addition means that it can and will
clean everything with bleach as with
most female units this model is
extremely complicated and lacks
any usable QuickStart guide or manual
the system also features some unique
characteristics unconventional to most
female units for instance it can tell
you at least cursory specs on car models
from over 20 distinct vehicle
manufacturers it also comes with
standard motorcycle licensing and to say
that it can operate a manual
transmission would only scratch the
surface on the possible configurations
of use pre-installed software includes
advanced cooking simulator gearhead JDM
Edition and with a plethora of
additional programs
it's a mystery as to why this product is
sold at such an aggressive price point
alright guys that is going to wrap it up
for this unboxing once again that has
been the Jenny and Brian models if you
guys enjoyed them please leave the
comments section below let me know what
you guys think of my new hardware my
that sounds terrible my new roommates
and if you'd like to see them in more of
the awesomesauce videos that I put up
here please let me know and give me some
ideas on how you'd like me to
incorporate them in future videos if any
so with that said thank you guys for
watching the video I'm Kyle with
awesomesauce news once again subscribe
to the channel if you haven't already
give me a like and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
