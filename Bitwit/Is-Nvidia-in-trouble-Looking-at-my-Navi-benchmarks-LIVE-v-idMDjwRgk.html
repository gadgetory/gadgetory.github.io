are we live yes it looks like we're life
hello welcome welcome welcome welcome
hope you guys are doing well let me know
if things are all looking good in in
chat if if you can hear me if you can
see me yes crazy day
what a crazy morning right we've had a
ton of launches with with AMD risin 3000
and now Navi which we'll be talking
about today I've got the Radeon rx I'm
sorry yeah Radeon RX 50 750 700 XT right
here tested against the archaic super
cards which are strewn about behind me
for for a theatrical
it's it's kind of a crazy launch it's
been yeah I just I can empathize with
all of the reviewers and stuff just it's
just been non-stop testing and
benchmarking recording and editing and
retesting so there's obviously a ton of
content in all of your sub boxes right
now and including some from myself I
posted my rise in 3000 video earlier
this morning along with everyone else
and I figured that for Navi for the
benchmarks at least I would would do a
stream because you guys are probably
already just sat through like a ton of
reviews already and just like you know
teleprompter just recording after
recording I figured this would be just
like a looser format that we can just
sort of talk and hang out and just
discuss the benchmark so instead of just
talking at you with facts and killing
you with information I figured we could
just just casually chill out and and
look at some benchmarks so I even have a
beer to enhance the the casual nature of
this experience it's past noon it's it's
12:00 it's 12:03
or 4 so it's fine so yeah it's it's also
been crazy this is this whole GPU war
with the you know between the two the
two big dogs
the only dogs with Nvidia releasing r-tx
super
just sort of really last-minute and and
then AMD even more or less minute coming
in and dropping the prices which press
didn't even know about until a day or
two before lunch I kid you not we were
all just like white we were we were just
as shocked as you guys if you thought we
had this information in the bag you know
we could go or something no so I
definitely I definitely screwed a lot of
her viewers over fortunately I hadn't
shot my Nabi video or I hadn't even like
well obviously I did not shooting one
but there was some press there are some
reviewers who I won't mention by name
but who had already recorded their
videos and had to re-record because
price is obviously a huge factor but we
have seen some crazy competitive moves
on both fronts so why don't we just dive
into it I'm just gonna go go willy-nilly
here look at this I did the whole I did
the whole transition today look at that
in plankton which portal alright so GPU
specs just some comparison here just to
add a glance these are the GPS I've been
testing today
RTX 2060 rx 5700 r-tx 2060 super rx 5700
xt r TX 2070 super and r TX 2080 I'm
sorry if I didn't get around to testing
a GPU that you really hoped I would
include there just wasn't enough time
I'm shocked that I actually got away
with testing this many cards and if
you're wondering the order that I've
positioned them in here from left to
right goes from cheapest to most
expensive and in the r TX 2060 and rx
5700 these two cards are actually the
same price at 349 US Dollars and then
the r TX 2060 super and the RX 5700 xt
are the same price at 399 so yeah these
are you know I put them next to their
direct competitors because pricing is
going to determine how close to the
performance is between the two cards r
TX 2070 super and r TX 2880 are the the
big GPUs the big dogs here because their
price is significantly higher than all
the other cards here we would expect
accordingly that the performance is
significantly higher as well and will
take a look at that right now the other
thing is that there's a lot of
information on here so feel free to
absorb it memorize it commit it to
memory and just I don't know for when
you might need it later I don't know
when you would but it is an option
so let's just dive in to our first slide
here and sorry that my my face is kind
of awkwardly wedged to the to the right
side here is the only place literally
the only place in the whole screen that
wouldn't cover up any benchmarks I had
to like slide through all the benchmarks
to all the slides to make sure that it
wasn't masking out anything but anyway
here's our hardware setup just a really
quick glance I completely forgot to
include the CPU like I said it's been a
long spent long last week but the 9700 K
is what I used completely stock the the
core i7 I did go with an Intel platform
as you can see a gigabyte z3 90 horas
extreme motherboard 16 gigs of g.skill
Sniper X ddr4 at 3400 360 millimeter aao
and these are the cards that I tested
now bear in mind that the cards all the
r-tx cards are founders edition cards
while while all the GPUs that we're
testing today are running stock out of
the box the RT X cards our founders
Edition cards which are more or less on
the same level as like a custom board
variant a custom card variant where
you've got it's basically it's factory
overclocked from Nvidia it is not
invidious reference GPU like the Radeon
rx 550 700 XT and 5700 so bear in mind
that these are just like peer reference
specs reference clock speeds whereas the
EFI cards are factory overclocked
essentially so in a sense it's an unfair
comparison if I ever did this with you
know with custom cards versus reference
cards and had you know and you know
actually had the option not to people
would be all up on me you know I'd be
excommunicated from the PC master-race
community but there's no there's no
there's nothing we can do here because
the video doesn't actually provide the
reference GPUs to press or to anyone for
that matter so those are the specs
that's that's everything we're working
with let's dive into our first slide
here thank you guys for the donations
Scott I
see I see you I see you I know you know
I don't know you but thank you for the
donations and superjet don't need to do
that I wasn't planning on reading any of
the the messages attached to them
no wifey sauces moderating but she's not
like copying all the messages there so
thank you in advance to anyone who's
donating but you don't have to fire
strike extreme look at this okay so are
obviously r-tx 2080 and r-tx 2070 super
are gonna be top performers here because
of their higher price but the RX 5700 XT
is actually outperforming the r-tx 2060
super by quite a bit here and again I've
organized these I position these cards
based on price RTX 2080 being the most
expensive in RTX 2060 being the least
expensive but of course being the same
price as the RX 5700 and then these two
cards are the same price as well so
you're gonna want to you're gonna
anticipate you're gonna see probably
comparable performance between these two
cards and these two cards or so you
would think based on the pricing whereas
these two cards would pull ahead most of
the time by quite a bit but here it's
pretty impressive the RX 5700 XT is
pretty much keeping pace with the 2070
super and it's definitely beating out
its direct competitor the 2060 super by
quite a bit and then same goes for the
RX 5700 I mean we've got just
domineering performance over the 2060
even though they are again the same
price if you look at time spy pretty
comparable performance now between the
5700 XT and the 2060 super which again
makes sense the 5,700 and the 2060 are
pretty close here but 5,700 is still
pulling ahead and the big dogs on top
are way ahead of the pack as you would
expect
first Title I tested was ashes of the
singularity at NDP and I did three
resolutions 1080p 1440p and 3840 by 2160
all sixteen by nine of course just to
give a range although I think most
people using these GPUs are probably
gonna target 1080p and 1440p thought I'd
throw 4k in there as well so here we go
it's looking pretty competitive
between the 5,700 X T and the 2060 super
I would say that this is pretty square
because you know one frame per second
difference is chalked up to margin of
error I would say that this is a pretty
much a stalemate here 5,700 is pulling
ahead by quite a bit by RT X 2060 I
can't remember the last time I saw a
similarly priced AMD card beating out
outright beating out a Nvidia card in
ashes of the singularity that's that's
pretty impressive and you know the
one-percent lows are a bit higher as
well so that's this is a good sign this
is a really good sign we also have at
1440p same same results more or less
we've got the 5700 XT outpacing the 2060
super and the 5700 actually not just
beating out the 2060 but getting the
same score as the 2060 super which is
super not for NVIDIA but it is super for
AMD ironically that's that's that's
pretty cool and then at 4k we have
pretty much same results very similar
results 5,700 just looking like a champ
coming up against the 2060 super there
5700 XT ahead of that and 2060 trailing
behind big dogs on top we're gonna see
in Division 2 a very similar trend this
is division 2 this this slide actually
represents sort of the trend that we're
gonna see most of the time on average
we're gonna see this sort of this sort
of ranking play out as well it should
based on the pricing but notice that the
AMD cards are outpacing their direct
Nvidia counterparts for the same price
so 5700 XT 96 FPS versus 89 on the 2060
super and these are pretty close 5,700
is you know it's basically the same as
2060 however the one-percent lows are
taking a dive here AMD has been known to
not have the greatest or most consistent
frame times in titles compared to Nvidia
and that definitely shows here in this
particular test not exactly sure why
that is for for this generation of cards
but you can see here that it is taking a
dive there however average frame rates
are looking good division 2 at 1440p
looks like the 5,700 was able to get it
get it stuff together and and pull up
its 1% lows by a bit but same ranking
here we're seeing a very scaling like
almost like a staircase going from the
bottom to the top with AMD still looking
like the better value overall and it's
also worth noting that the 5700 XT so
far has been kind of a nice stopgap
almost an even stopgap between the 20 60
super and the 20 70 super but the 20 70
super is $100 more expensive so I don't
know it feels like the 57 XT is really
blowing both of the Nvidia cards beside
it out of the water in terms of
performance when you're talking about
the 2060 super and value in reference to
the 2070 super but moving on to 4k
obviously as we scale up in resolution
we're gonna see the the gap start to
close because we're now getting
progressively more GPU bound taking less
stress off of the CPU so we see some
pretty comparable results here between
both the direct competitors with the big
dogs
skipping ahead by a lot and by a lot
this time there are definitely occasions
where the 2070 super just outright
demolishes the 5700 XT but honestly for
the price difference that should be
happening like 95% of the time not like
65 let's move on guys thank you I'm just
gonna say just I saw a $20 donation
Jackal thank you so much I appreciate
the donation thank you guys again I'm
not gonna be reading off like the full
comments but I do appreciate all all the
donations their doom 1440p r-tx 2080 and
2070 pulling ahead once again but 5700
XT not too shabby right in between 2060
and the 2070 super 5700 took a huge dive
here for some odd reason now it's worth
addressing that I did best for best best
versus best here just like AMD did for
their their Nabi press press conference
where they actually tested the best
performing api's given you know
depending on the hardware so for the
Radeon cards I've tested in Vulcan and I
tested with OpenGL for all the RT X
cards because those are the best
performing api's I felt like that was a
fair compare
if you're gonna buy an AMD GPU chances
are if you have Vulcan as an option in a
certain title you're gonna you're gonna
run it in that API for the greater
performance so that's what you're seeing
here
however the framerate capture tool the
performance measuring tool that I was
using to capture bulkin because fraps
doesn't support Vulcan was not pumping
out consistent one to one percent lows
so I felt that data was invalid so I
just threw it out entirely
that's why there's no one percent lows
but this is still pretty telling to see
the average frame rates here with 5700
XT doing a great job 5700 not doing so
hot you can see it didn't do so hot
either it at 4k for some reason just
even with Vulcan it's just falling
behind the RTF 2060 this this might be
the only test or it's actually falling
behind out of the 2060 gaps are starting
to close obviously at 4k but 5700 XT is
still on top far cry 5 this is a pretty
heavily an AMD favorite game and we can
pretty much see that here with the rx
5700 outpacing the 2060 Super which is
$50 more expensive and then we have the
5700 XT pretty much on par with the 2070
super again for $100 more expensive so
yeah there are certain AMD favorite
titles where this is gonna this is bound
to happen
our TX 2080 is just a beast of a GPU and
so I probably haven't been talking about
it very much it's not super competitive
with the other cards it's just in a
different class of its own because it's
so expensive and so fast but if you're
targeting 144 FPS maybe you've got your
eye on that so crazy results there again
somewhat more the same here 2060 super
kind of taking a dive taking a backseat
against both Radeon cards and the rx
2060 just falling behind again
AMD is looking really strong here just
look at that just catching up to the
2070 super it's crazy and then in 4k
yeah 4k is more of the same smaller gaps
and in GTA 5 GTA 5 is more heavily
NVIDIA favored so here we are signior TX
2060 super for once outpaced the RX 5700
XT in both average frame rates and 1%
lows and finally we see the RT x 2060
actually smacking the crap out of the
5700 going from 97 to 106 FPS on average
but it's actually interesting to to see
how close you know the 2060 super is to
the 2070 super here in some games it's
just even in videos own own card is
competing with the card above it so it's
kind of funny at 1440p we also see
Nvidia just sort of winning this round
both of the 2060 super and the 22 2016 2
/ n 2060 with with the top dogs taking
their lead and at 4k more the same bear
in mind these are I haven't been reading
off the settings but you know they're
right here if you want to look at
quality settings pretty much maxed out
across the board I always test the same
settings in every benchmarking video
that I do so in GTA 5 it's max settings
across the board with the exception of
MSA which is always at 2x 2x NSAA
the reason why I use 2x at MSA is
because I feel like just it's sort of
subjective I feel like it's a good
compromise between performance hit and
and quality 4x really takes your
performance a lot more and no at no MSAA
just kind of looks really Jaggi so if in
case you were wondering
Metro Exodus this is a new game that I
actually added to the benchmark suite
and it's it's a very consistent built-in
benchmark which is why I like it
2070 super is just you know barely
edging out the 5700 XT but the 5700 XT
is again demolishing the 2060 super and
the 5700 the 5700 is also crushing the
2060
I believe Metro Exodus is a Radeon
favorite game though so bear that in
mind
at 1440p same thing again a lot of these
trends I mean you're starting to see
you've been seeing this the same trend
over and over so I'm kind of like I feel
like a broken record at this
which is why I'm not spending as much
time on on the slides as we as we
progress unless some anomaly pops up or
you see something really out of place
but at 4k pretty much the same thing all
these cards are really good performers
you know if you have three hundred or
three to four hundred bucks to spend on
any of these four GPUs but obviously AMD
is looking like the better value right
now shadow the Tomb Raider at 1080p I
believe this is very Nvidia favorite
which no I don't know actually
at any rate oh yeah my baby I kind of
forget our x57 hundred is getting the
same score as the r-tx 2060 super for
fifty dollars cheaper the RX 5700 xt is
slightly closer to the 2070 super
performance than it is to the NVIDIA GPU
of of the same price which is nice and
2060 trailing behind there not much
difference between 2070 super and 2080
super obviously the higher up you go in
you know GPU tier or any really really
any hardware tier you start to see the
law of diminishing returns so you're
paying more for less performance or less
performance gain obviously you're paying
more for more performance but the the
games that you're getting
percentage-wise
start to shrink more and more as you
scale up that's just how it is that's
how it's always been
1440p we're the same rx 5700 just just
doing a really good job 5,700 XT also
doing great even closer to the 2070
super now and you know yeah
broken record 4k same thing actually
yeah so 4k or you're gonna see a lot of
cards direct competitor cards perform
very closely 5,700 XT and 2060 super
both 39 FPS with similar 1% lows and
somehow the 5,700 is still pulling well
ahead of the 2060 sorry I don't have
like the actual percentages for you guys
I usually do when I actually have a
recorded video but this was sort of on a
whim
so total frame is rendered this is
across all the games however at 1080p
remember that we omitted Doom at
I forgot to mention that the reason why
we didn't have a doom 1080p slide it's
it's the same reason that I explained in
my rise in 3000 video is because it has
a 200 FPS cap and all these GPUs are
maxing that out so you can't really it's
kind of a pointless benchmark to run at
that res so you'll see that these total
frames rendered are actually less less
frames were rendered at this then in the
1440p benchmark so don't freak out it's
just because we we took doom out at
1080p but here's the trend that we've
been seeing over and over is is this
kind of nice almost even staircase
effect with the Radeon cards really
delivering a better price to performance
and better value overall than their
direct nvidia counterparts with the are
the RX 5700 xt rendering more frames and
similar the exactly same priced 20 60
super and the 5700 pretty much the same
deal I feel like yeah the 5700 XT is
outpacing the 2060 super buy a little
bit more buy a little bit more than the
5700 is over the 2016 just overall you
know obviously your mileage may vary but
from what we're seeing here and also the
5700 XT circling back to that initial
thought that I had is it's looking like
a really good deal compared to the even
the 2070 super because I mean this is
just look at the staircase here right
boom boom boom 350 dollars still $350
400 or I'm sorry $500 okay sorry I keep
I keep I'm sorry I'm getting all messed
up $400 $400 $500 there it is
so yeah you can see that it's just such
a good value you don't want to pay $100
more for you know this much extra
performance unless you absolutely need
it for some weird niche reason the 5700
XT is looking really good at 1440p it's
almost the exact same thing the gaps a
little bit smaller here between these
two cards but 5700 XT is looking really
good 2080 dominating as usual and at 4k
you can see that the trend is pretty
much similar
so that's has a lot of benchmarks but I
think the takeaway here is that the
Radeon cards are actually a better value
in terms of raw performance raw gaming
performance if all you care about is
framerate then you just want the best
bang for the buck in terms of raw gaming
performance I can see little reason to
choose the Nvidia super cards over over
the rx 5700 series I think what it boils
down to at that point is is if you care
about the actual features that each
family of GPU offers and for example I
took a poll actually the other day and
you guys weighed in I said price and
performance aside which family of GPUs
has better features overall and so for
Nvidia I was talking about things like
ray tracing and DL SS and so forth and
with AMD there they're newer features
like anti-lag Radeon image sharpening
there's also some existing features like
chill and stuff like that and there was
an overwhelming majority of you that
that said that you favor the Nvidia
features so I think that mostly boils
down to ray tracing ray tracing really
got off on the wrong foot initially when
it first launched because of just how it
was presented how there was virtually
zero support for it because of how how
damaging it was to performance just to
enable it and how you really needed to
have like a 20 80 or 20 80 TI to really
even enjoy it to some degree on the very
few games that it did support but now
it's a little bit different you know
it's been it's been quite a while since
that since that happened and we're
seeing increasingly you know just more
and more support for ray tracing and a
lot more games it seems like it's
something that's here to stay Nvidia
sort of being the top dog in the GPU
space for for quite a while now you
start to see a lot of developers just
hop on the bandwagon all right whatever
Nvidia is doing we're gonna support it
we're gonna move the sport I'm sure
Nvidia is investing tons of dollars into
making ray tracing just more prevalent
and more relevant to gamers overall so
they can obviously bump up you know puff
up their chests and bump up the the
feature set make it look better make ray
tracing support on a hardware level much
more appealing to the average
gamer and they've certainly done that
the performance is getting better more
games are being supported it seems like
every other week we're seeing like a new
game that now supports ray-tracing and
but bunch of people doing videos on it
like I look so good and you know the
performance isn't as bad as it used to
be so I can see why this poll result is
what it is the AMD features on the other
hand I feel like have a lot of good
niche applications I feel like there are
some people like eSports players eSports
gamers who are you know really looking
to save that extra frame or two in games
anti-lag can provide that but I know for
me just speaking personally I am NOT a
good enough gamer I don't have fast
enough reflexes to benefit from
something like anti lag if I'm speaking
honestly and I think that's a majority
of gamers we're not all Pro leet gamers
I'm sure a lot of us think you know some
people think they are but at the end of
the day it's it seems like a more niche
feature image sharpening bear in mind I
haven't had a chance to test out any of
these AMD features but just from the
general consensus is that rate racing
seems to be a bit more relevant and more
desirable of a feature and I think
that's also because it's been around
longer it's had time to grow and develop
who knows what you know improvements
could be made upon these existing AMD
these brand new AMD features down the
line but for now AMD I'm sorry Nvidia
seems to have a leg up on the feature
game their feature game is strong to say
the least so I guess my point I'm trying
to make here is that the AMD cards right
now price the performance if you're just
looking at GPU if you're just needing a
gaming performance these are a better
value than their direct competitors so
but if you care about features and you
want ray-tracing support on a hardware
level because these do not support you
know don't support hardware based
ray-tracing then that could easily sway
your decision and you shouldn't feel bad
for choosing either or it just boils
down to your preferences and your
specific needs
as a user so I think Nvidia or I'm sorry
AMD has done a bang-up job with these
cards I can't wait to see some like
custom board partners that board partner
cards that aren't so noisy by the way
check out gamers nexuses video
on the 5700 XT that he just dropped he
talks about he goes in depth as usual
Steve as about the the actual blower
style coolers they're not the best
it's a blower style card they're noisy
they're hot and he said you know the
performance he pretty much drew the same
conclusions as I did today but he said
wait for the custom board partner cards
and from testing this for the last
couple days I can definitely agree with
that
don't buy a blower sell card unless of
course you plan to like mount a GPU
waterblock on to it then that's
definitely a viable reason but yeah
that's that that's pretty much what it
boils down to you guys it's it's pretty
exciting to see AMD just like actually
outperforming Nvidia in the GPU space
for the same price I can't remember the
last time that's happened it's been
years honestly so you know features
aside even though ray-tracing seems more
appealing like just from a performance
standpoint price to performance
standpoint this these these cards are
really cool I mean that figuratively of
course no no thermal testing has been
done on this day but that's pretty much
gonna conclude it for me guys I wanted
to keep this short and sweet to the
point there's a lot of other content out
there that I suggest you guys watch to
get a wider sample size as always but
thank you so much for tuning in to the
stream let me know in the comments
whether you're watching this live or
after the fact if this works for you
this type of content works for you like
streaming benchmarks is the first time
I've ever streamed benchmarks I think
but it seemed kind of kind of fun kind
of a new different idea let me know if
you'd like me to do this again for
future launches or if this was terrible
and I should never do it again and I
should bury my head in the ground but
I'm gonna get out of here guys they get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
