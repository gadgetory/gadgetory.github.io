brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
pour sir to learn more about our
sponsors click on the links below
alright so if you're gonna actually
spend $2,000 on an extreme motherboard
like the asus rog dominus you better
have some insane memory configuration to
go along with it so where better to find
that then here at g.skill we've got 384
gigs it's 32 gig sticks a full dozen a
full dozen of these sticks and they're
running at 4,000 megahertz with the
relatively low cast latency all things
considered of CL 18 30 30 45 contrary to
what you might think at first they're
not they're actually not using the the
dual layer memory chips but rather a
very high density I see that I think
they're still waiting on a patent for
I'm not don't quote me on that but you
should be able to see these released to
the market hopefully sometime this year
but having the high density ICS
definitely preserves the look of the RAM
so the heat spreaders don't have to be
extra tall since you're not you know
double layering the having two rows of
memory chips for example it's just
absolutely insane ok what kind of work
would you have to do to eat up 384 gigs
we've also got 5000 kits a bit more
modest 16 gigabytes but still very very
fast memory here latency is going to be
of course a little bit better than that
configuration over there because we just
don't have the crazy medic capacity so
CL 18 and 24 24 54 there's just a bunch
of other configurations here if you've
got a 5,000 megahertz Kate running at CL
17 pretty much straight across the board
this is on the ROG
Maximus 11 apex again again a 16
gigabyte configuration there and the
list kind of just goes on 5200 megahertz
is their fastest kit on display as far
as the live demo goes and that's CLA
team that's on D MSI mpg to see 390 I
gaming edge AC we do have some demos
here of their memory running in X 570
boards however they're still using rise
in second gen 2700 X's it'll be
interesting to see how the the RAM might
behave differently once third gender
eyes and chips are slotted in here but
for now we can just kind of gawk and and
appreciate the X
seventy boards lid that's a rampage
eight hero from Asus very nice board
there that we saw earlier at the event
and this is one I haven't actually seen
you this is from asrock the x5 70 tai
chi which looks pretty classy you can
see it's got that sort of steampunk vibe
that we're familiar with they're on a
chip set I believe I think that yeah
that is a fan that's a we're still doing
some active cooling of course on the
chipset as well as they do get fairly
warm compared to last gen here we have
to try to NZ me oh this is actually
going to be optimized for risin 3000
this is probably the most exciting kit
that they have here because it's
completely brand new and for the
upcoming AMD platform you can see that
there's a slight redesign here they kind
of have like a colored colored piece
that wasn't there before on the existing
tridents ER gb ram you still get
addressable RGB lighting right here up
top but just sort of a nice little
aesthetic change right there they're
also playing around with the idea of
offering different colors you can see
here but I don't know I'm not a huge fan
of these I mean if I was going for a
specific color then you know obviously I
would go for that but I think they're
gonna sell a lot more units that have
more of a neutral color schemes and like
silver gray maybe even white I think
those would be good options but I think
more importantly I'm just excited to see
these getting populated into x5 70
boards running horizon 3000 processors
very very little information apart from
that they're not saying what what speed
these are gonna be rated for what
they're gonna go up to what capacities
are gonna be offered in this is really
just a prototype that they're showing
off here but they are saying it's coming
relatively soon so I kind of walked by
this little demo area earlier and I was
like what the what the heck is this this
is like a holder for your your
eyeglasses or something it's actually a
mouse it's a mouse for business
professionals I guess anyone can use it
anyone who's on the go really it's got
this cover so you know it keeps you
protected for storage and travel it's
magnetic so it kind of just slides on
and off like that very easy but it's
completely it's very flat it's a very
flattened house keeps a low profile
again easy to take around with you
pretty simple button layout here left
and right clicks with a scroll wheel I
guess the main attraction here is that
apart from being extremely portable it
has a laser sensor that it can actually
work on glass surfaces so they've got
this little demo here I did not draw
this but I will contribute so very it
seems very precise nice a nice smooth
responsiveness and this is on a piece of
glass
last lap this will work on a variety of
other surfaces and textures as well it's
just supposed to be as versatile as
possible so you don't actually need to
travel with the mousepad pretty much at
all if you're gonna be toting this guy
around oh I should also mention that
there's an on/off switch right here and
you can switch between Bluetooth or
wireless connectivity depending on your
preference
there is a wireless dongle if you choose
to go the wireless option that you can
actually store the dongle in here under
this little cover you can see that it is
battery-powered with a couple triple A's
g.skill g.skill makes portable nice now
fun so this is a computer case flute or
not and that's actually connected to one
of these ln2 tanks this is just for demo
show purposes then I can be able to tell
us on the market no very few people
would be able to buy this let alone run
it effectively with all BL and two in
one day
it's taking up one of these Ellen 2
tanks so Ellen 2 is constantly being
pumped into here actually there's a
lower evaporation chamber that it goes
into initially and then as it evaporates
the gas comes up to this upper chamber
basically cools the entire interior I
think they have a 9900 KF that's running
at 5.7 gigahertz right now and I think
16 gigs of their tried NZ RGB memory
that's at 4800 megahertz so that's all
of course with the the help of the
ridiculously low ambient temperatures
it's negative negative 60 degrees
Celsius in here right now which is
absolutely insane now this thing over
here isn't quite literally as cool but
metaphorically it's as cool as it gets
this is actually a heavily modified
system by the guys of here km studio
thanks to them for putting this together
this is actually a fake beer cooled
system alright so unfortunately the the
liquid flowing through here through
these tubes that's cooling our CPU over
there is not real beer it's a it's fake
beer although it looks very convincing
you can see it in that reservoir there
nice little drain valve and everything
very cool but it does have however a
full-blown kegerator at the bottom and
that does contain genuine beer with a
full-blown tap that's hooked up to it
actually I got the sample at earlier and
the beer tastes very good it even tastes
a little overclocked if I'm being honest
that's all for my coverage here at the G
skill booth here at Computex 2019 thank
you guys so much for watching this video
thanks to all my sponsors go ahead and
check them out in the description below
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
