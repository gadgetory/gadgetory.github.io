awesomesauce Network so I was planning
on doing a regular video this week but
something happened to the point where I
was like okay I have to put that video
on hold and I have to talk about this I
couldn't pass up the opportunity to make
a video on it so I was out to lunch
earlier today with my mother and on the
way when we got back to her house my
neighbor came out of his house I guess
my mom's neighbor came out and he was
like hey cow but I heard you know a
thing or two about computers and then he
was like well I've got a computer
problem and I was wondering if you take
a look at it so I went over to his place
briefly check out his computer and it's
just a total wreck it's probably I don't
know when he got it but the the model of
computer itself it's an HP a six zero
three zero and if you want to look that
up but it started I think it came out
released in 2007 so it's a potentially
he's been using it for good eight years
I don't quote me on that though I'm not
sure exactly what year he got it at any
rate he said that there were tons of
popups and he's you know he thinks that
there might be viruses on it which I'm
almost confident under person confident
at this point that there are probably
even worse things than that on his
computer so I decided to take it off of
his hands and bring it home with me to
do some magic with it here it is
right there it's nice little HP kept it
in pretty good shape actually uh
visually it's not terrible to look at
and even going inside it doesn't look
too bad actually let me turn the system
towards the window so you get some
natural lighting in there there we go
cable management could be much improved
there are no intake fans you're pretty
much reliant on whatever cooling this
this little cooler master AMD cooler is
doing and that being exhausted by the
single yellow fan right there in the
back as well as the power supply up here
which is just sucking in more hot air
and blowing it out the back there really
quickly here's here's a look at the
specs I've got the system powered up
right now it's a run AMD Athlon 64 x2
dual-core processor so at least he's got
two cores in there it's not
too bad I bet once I do a clean install
of Windows here it should be running
just fine it's a 4800 plus 2.5 gigahertz
2 gigs of RAM yes you can see there's
two sticks right there just two of them
there is room for two more so you can
get a total of 4 gigs but that's pretty
much the mechs we'll be able to get
because this the hard drive is running
Windows Vista 32-bit so for we're pretty
much stuck with 4 gigs for now I wish I
could slot some memory in for him I do
have some spare ddr3 dimms on me right
now that I wouldn't mind parting with he
could probably use them much more than I
can but these are this is a ddr2 board
there yeah so we're talking last
generation all the things we got a 320
gig I think that's a WD caviar drive
right there it says only driving the
system but we will be wiping that
because at first I was like well you
know how bad is it maybe he's
exaggerating things oh oh it's bad it's
bad check this out
first off got a three got a 3.0 in
Windows Experience Index now you guys
remember Windows Experience Index when
that was a thing but I pulled up task
manager here and this is seriously just
from turning the computer on I haven't
started running any problems or any
programs I'm sorry and we're already
seeing like spikes up to 99% CPU usage
at times so this is this is serious like
right there 99 right there to the point
where like I can't even move the mouse
cursor you can also see 1.3 of the 2
gigabytes of ram is being used currently
and this is just what what I would
consider idling but obviously it's not
just idling because there are background
programs that are just running
unbeknownst to him my neighbor and you
can even tell from down here look at
these freaking icons his icon tray is
just littered with junk any what is this
live weather bug driver restores trying
to connect some some things or trying to
hack into your computer that's that's
what that means
oh god oh god what's it doing so I think
right now the next step is to go into
his folders try to find his pictures and
other important documents and basically
just back those up onto an external hard
drive so that he doesn't lose them once
I do a clean install and then at that
point I'm just gonna revamp this system
I'm going to I don't know if I'm gonna
have to gut the whole thing but I'm
definitely going to dust it out
and maybe do some rewiring make it look
nice and pretty because you know that's
how we roll and that should be pretty
much it so sit back relax and enjoy this
I guess this PC makeover that I'm about
to do
you
you
all right so here is the revamped system
sitting all nice and pretty in my room
oh yeah you can see it looks a much
cleaner it wasn't terribly dirty to
begin with it was actually a lot cleaner
to begin with than I thought it would be
but there was still tons of goop I just
nicked myself with Finn there were still
tons of dust buildup of course on the
bottom and just resting on top of all
the other components I pretty much deep
clean this entire thing I didn't stab
him uh the board or the power supply or
the hard drive or anything like that but
I did take off the the exhaust fan as
well as the CPU cooler as you guys
probably could tell from the time-lapse
and I deep-clean that the crap out of
both of those things because there was
just quite a bit of dust buildup on them
and I just want to make sure that it
wasn't impeding any performance just
apart from dusting I did try to tidy up
the cable management as best I could of
course that's easier said than done when
you're talking about a non modular power
supply as well as no space whatsoever
behind the motherboard tray to do any
cable routing so that's why you can see
here all the cables are just kind of
hanging out in the only compartment of
this chassis of course dealing with the
IV cable is virtually impossible
there's just no great way to route that
but I think I did a fairly good job
considering all things considered I kind
of tried to tidy up the CPU for pen CPU
cable right there as well as the fan
cable I'm really happy with how how
clean the heatsink turned out it just
looks it looks brand new in fact this
whole system almost could probably pass
for brand new just because I did a
pretty good job cleaning it but apart
from that I did do a clean install of
Windows 8.1 when we turn the aperture up
here so you can actually see what I'm
talking about
here it is running I've got a YouTube
video open that's playing right now for
EP as well as WordPad these are the only
two applications I have running right
now
because I feel like this this is my best
guess at the typical workload that my
neighbor will be utilizing on his system
at any given at any given moment
he's not a power user whatsoever he's a
very very basic user he's an older guy
he's not a tech he's not tech savvy or
anything like that so he's not gonna be
doing too much on this system other than
probably have a couple of these simple
applications open so that said we've got
about 35% CPU usage which is better than
what we were seeing at so called idling
before I went in and fix things up just
because there was so much malware and
viruses running in the background but I
you do still see the CPU spike up to 99%
just just at certain moments when the
video is playing which just you know
this is an old this is an old-ass system
and if I were to make any
recommendations hold on let me turn the
aperture back down so you can see again
if I were to make any recommendations
for my neighbor to upgrade I'd probably
just suggest getting like a you know
more current gen FM 2 plus CPU that way
you can take advantage of ddr3 memory
possibly get more than 2 gigs in there
you know maybe a Kaveri APU would work
out pretty nicely for his needs but
hopefully he will notice a huge a huge
difference in terms of speed with this
new system I shouldn't say new but this
revamp system and hopefully it makes him
happy that's what it's all about so
that's gonna conclude for now guys I
know this was a really impromptu video I
didn't really plan it too much it's very
kind of haphazardly thrown together but
hopefully you guys still got a kick out
of it
I really enjoy tinkering with this sort
of thing so hopefully you enjoy watching
it thank you guys for watching feel free
to toss me like on the video if you
liked it or if you like this type of
vlogedy stuff and I think that's pretty
much it subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already thank you all for
watching and I'll see you all in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
