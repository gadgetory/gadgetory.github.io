before the drop ends what's crackin
people welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well today wifey sauce
and I are doing something a little bit
different for you guys
switching it up as we often do we
figured since Halloween's just around
the corner and we're still in the month
of October at least the time of filming
this video that we would do something a
little fun and try assembling a
full-blown system a full-blown PC inside
of a friggin pumpkin I'm sure this has
been done plenty of times before on the
internet I did zero research beforehand
and and besides you can't escape
pumpkins pumpkins are everywhere and
they're in everything this time of year
I mean we can't drive personally we
can't drive a mile from our house
without seeing a damn pumpkin patch on
the side of the road and none of those
pumpkins have fully functioning pcs
inside of them and we saw that as a real
problem so we're aiming to fix all that
today with our little project here now
there are a couple things to consider
when building inside of a pumpkin as I'm
sure it's much different than working
with a traditional chassis in the fact
that it's just not designed for PC
builds at all
so the first of which is size and space
how can we possibly fit all this
hardware inside of one pumpkin pretty
easy just by a big enough pumpkin it's
pretty simple and then cut a big enough
opening to easily slide all the hardware
into it we feel like we got a pretty
good sized pumpkin that's not too big
because you know you don't want to go
too large otherwise the pumpkins all
cumbersome and heavy and hard to move
around and stuff like that we feel like
we did a pretty good job sizing out our
pumpkin we had to dig around for one but
I think we got a good one it remains to
be seen whether or not we'll have to
mount the the power supply here outside
of the pumpkin sort of as an external
power brick we're not sure yet we'll
cross that bridge when we get to it but
size and storage or size and space is
one thing is the first thing we
considered and I think we've got that
nailed down the second thing we got to
consider is cable management as most
pumpkins I know of do not feature any
sort of cable management you know aids
whatsoever so in that sense we actually
really had to try to use as few cables
as possible in this build but still have
a functioning system and I'm gonna
explain as I go over all the parts how I
think we managed to do that
and finally how do we prevent any
moisture or wetness from the pumpkin
itself from damaging any of our
components well first off we're gonna
line the inside of the pumpkin with some
plastic wrap we might double wrap it
just in case
additionally we have this metal plate
which is actually designed for mini ITX
motherboards it is actually a one of the
accessories from the enthu elite case
here from fantex as it is a dual system
chassis it's already got some
pre-installed standoffs from any ITX
we're just gonna mount it onto the or
mount the board on to it first so it can
act as a buffer between the main board
and the pumpkin itself so with that all
in mind folks let's go over the hardware
I'm gonna nail this down really quick
because we've got a lot to do starting
with our processor we've got a core i3
70 350 K from Intel this is a quad core
unlocked core i3 processor as part of
their KD Lake family on the LGA 1151
socket yes it's last generation it's
already old news because of coffee lake
but it's it's what I had lying around in
fact I should mention that this is not a
sponsored video all these parts that
were using today were just picked off of
my shelf and we're selected because I
felt they would be good for this
particular project so we've got this CPU
here yes this will be in overclockable
pumpkin very exciting stuff I've never
thought I'd say those words in one
sentence and then additionally we've got
a motherboard to pair with that to see
z170 I Gaming Pro AC from MSI this is a
fairly high-end motherboard all things
considered for Mini ITX on the z170
chipset of course and we do have two
DIMM slots a single PCIe gen3 by 16 slot
m2 is very important to have in the back
as that is the only drive we'll be using
with this build of course and a data SP
900 256 gig capacity super overkill in
fact most of the stuff is overkill for a
pumpkin PC I guess depending on what you
want to do with the pumpkin anyway I'm
getting off topic here it's just a
regular SATA Drive nothing fancy no nvme
but it's gonna be just fine to a boot
off of and install some applications
definitely some RGB software as well as
we'll get around to we've got a 16
gigabyte kit of this Myshkin black line
Frostbite ram ddr4 at 2400 speed
additionally we've got our cooler our
CPU cooler is going to be the cryo rig
c7 this is a very low profile but
well-performing cooler for its size it's
fairly quiet as well this is going to
a fantastic cooler I think for this bill
there's only a single single three pin
I'm sorry four pin PWM cable coming off
of it going to reduce some of the cable
clutter for our graphics card I went
with the geforce gtx 1050 TI from EVGA i
specifically chose this card because its
first off low powered we don't need a
massive power supply to drive it
additionally it doesn't have any PCIe
plugs on it gets all of its power
straight from the PCIe slot the 75 watt
slot from the motherboard is gonna be
enough to juice this guy just fine and
additionally it's not a bad card 1050 Ti
is pretty solid for 1080p gaming so this
will be not just an overclockable
pumpkin but a gaming pumpkin as well now
for our power supply I went with the SF
450 watt unit from Coursera this is an
sfx unit it's about as small as they
come for a system like this it's fully
modular as well which is going to help
reduce cable clutter even further so
happy to be using that again we'll see
if we can actually fit this inside of
the pumpkin or if we're gonna have to
resort to mounting it externally either
way it should be functional and then
finally we've got some RGB lighting up
in here I was gonna use like an NZXT hue
plus and I figured that would be just
way too complicated for a build like
this so we're just using this I have the
bucks over here it's the USB mood light
for your TV actually design for your TV
I picked this up off of Amazon I'll drop
some links in the description or
something like that so you guys can
check it out but it comes with a remote
so you can change different different
modes it's fully RGB and it's a USB I
think is the most important to peel for
me is that you can just plug this in
directly to the back of the motherboard
and that's pretty much all the power you
need you don't need to deal with another
molex or SATA cable that you need to
hook up to the power supply for they're
making things just a royal mess and
things like that so very happy with the
parts that we have here I'm feeling very
confident of course we have not even
started building yet so I should not
speak too soon now while I've been
sitting here rambling off to you guys
wifey sauce has actually been in the
office kitchen this whole time getting a
head start on carving that pumpkin and
she's much more artistic than I am
anyway so it's probably best we leave
that job to her but why don't we go
ahead and cut away to a little time left
see what she's been up to and we can
circle back with our components here and
start assembling our gaming pumpkin PC
all right let's see that beautiful mug
let's see oh yes that is that's
glamorous well done wifey looks just
like me
yep and so let's see the lid so the lid
comes off like that we had to make it
extra large so that we could potentially
fit the motherboard and plate inside go
ahead and see if it fits
yeah I was afraid of that happening cuz
it's a it's a it's a bowl shape that
we're fitting it into so it's not gonna
go down as deep as the the center cut
the edges okay a shot I'm a little
concerned because it's already barely
fitting and we don't even have the power
supply or graphics card in there I was
thinking that too you know I told the
viewers that I was sure we got a big
enough pumpkin for this task but I might
be eating my words right now all right
moment of truth this will determine
whether or not we need a new pumpkin oh
oh kind of it kind of works though then
we still needed to get like the graphics
card in there now hold on hold on all
right so now we have the graphics card
mounted onto the motherboard and we've
kind of wrapped the whole thing in our
plastic wrap here just to prevent any
sort of moisture getting into the
components because we have not yet
wrapped the inside of our pumpkin so
we're just going to see if this fits
right now
is that a good up or a bad up I can't
tell from here oh snap we're so close
though
freaking pumpkin modding really at all
yes we just go get a big pumpkin alright
let's go get a big pumpkin alright guys
so wifey sauce has just come back and
she brought a huge pumpkin with her it's
quite a bit bigger than our original one
although I did make some headway here
I'm kind of disappointed that we're not
gonna be able to see this one through
because I feel like this would have
worked all we would need to do is cut
out a little rectangular area of the lid
just to allow the IOB to be visible from
the graphics card and it would have been
fine however now that we have this big
guy I'm thinking we might even be able
to get the power supply in here as well
so we're actually gonna switch gears
here and abandon this pumpkin
tentatively for this one because I think
we can just do more here we won't feel
as cramped we'll have more room for
activities and LEDs and things like that
so let's go ahead and pretty much do all
the same craft we just did with that
pumpkin - this new one
alright guys so I have managed to fit
our motherboard CPU CPU cooler GPU and
PSU inside of our pumpkin here and it
fits snuggly mind you but it's in so
kudos to me and wifey sauce we did a
great job but we're not done yet we
still have to adhere the LED strip to
the pumpkin somehow and while 3m
adhesive is really good stuff I just
don't think it's gonna work in this
situation so what we can do is we can
get creative with some paper clips and
some some of these push pins here to try
to just try to pin this down to the
pumpkin I'm thinking we can probably run
this strip maybe from starting from the
side going all the way up to the edge
here on the the upper rim and back down
we really don't need too much length
maybe a good six to eight inches that's
what you said and then we should be good
and then we'll attempt to boot this guy
I've not done any trouble or any test
booting which is probably a bad idea but
but yeah I have utmost confidence that
this will all work fine and won't blow
up in our faces
alright folks the time has come the
system is complete and the only thing we
really have left to do is to try turning
it on and pray to God that it boots so
without further ado ladies and gentlemen
oh wait how are we gonna power this
thing we need a screwdriver yv
screwdriver quick
I forgot that pumpkins don't have power
buttons thank you very much okay um let
me go ahead and flip the power supply on
I gotta find the front panel connectors
here oh I think I see it
oh I need a smaller one a smaller
screwdriver to get in there no I got one
I got one
all right we've got a small screwdriver
and I've also got this Robo grip wrench
thing that I'm gonna use as an extension
just so I can get in there and it's also
got yeah the rubber grips will hopefully
prevent any sort of shock to my face we
have a fan spinning on the CPU cooler
and the GPU power supply fan is not
spinning but I would imagine that's due
to just a low low load operation silent
operation under low loads the TV might
have turned off automatically we do have
the video card running out to the TV or
the monitor here LEDs aren't turning on
either ah we got LEDs ah what's
happening here no signal what do you
mean no signal don't tell me no signal
we are not getting a signal ladies and
gentlemen alright guys so I may have to
swap this card out for a different gtx
1050 Ti I'll be right back
alright I got a video card I got the msi
gtx 1050 TI alright pretty much the same
thing as the EVGA same sort of size and
power requirements which is just
straight through the motherboard so
that's good so out with the EVGA card in
with the msi
no signal the new video card does not
work either which means it's probably an
issue with the motherboard so I'm gonna
try a different motherboard because I
think that's the root of the problem I
have used this board once in the past
and I was it was for a live Stratos
drunk and I've probably messed something
up with the board I'm pretty confident
everything else is working but let this
be a lesson to all of you as to why you
should always do an external test boot
before actually assembling your system
even if that system happens to be in a
pumpkin so don't go anywhere
we're not done yet I'm gonna get this
thing to freakin post by the end of this
video so yeah bear with me on to the
next thing here we go alright guys so we
have swapped out the motherboard we went
from and we actually got a pretty nice
upgrade one from Z 172 z 370 we're now
using the ROG Strix Z 370 gaming or z3
70 i gaining motherboard from asus and
the processor now has also received a
pretty nice upgrade to a core i5 8600 k
which is all the more reason for us to
fear this project blowing up in our
faces literally but we're ready for an
external test boot before we do any
pumpkin mounting so yeah the power
supplies on the things are connected to
the things and I'm gonna short it right
now nope
things are happening switching to
DisplayPort oh my
alright let's mount this sucker in the
pumpkin we had a bad motherboard we had
a bad motherboard wifey's loss as soon
as this video is over I want you to
personally take a flamethrower to this
thing okay this is not a massage ball by
the way I broke this cuz I'm done a year
ago and I apparently forgot that I broke
it so well folks we are now ready to
mount this guy into the pumpkin that we
created what feels like so long ago
let's uh let's do that now before this
thing stops working
cuz holy crap alright guys here we are
once again it seems all too familiar we
are ready to boot up the pumpkin PC
hopefully one last final time
because hopefully it'll work I don't
want to have to do this ever again this
has been terrible
look at that look at that we already
have windows installed on the friggin
SSD amazing that's not the right time at
all but I'm gonna give it a pass all
things considered why if you sauce will
you do the honors of capping off the
finished build with its lid porfavor so
wait you know a little hole in the back
for cables and stuff yay thank you very
much for your help honey looks
fantabulous I'm not used to seeing wires
coming out of a pumpkin with like
full-blown RGB LEDs out the front I say
we run some friggin benchmarks about
that wifey sauce is giving me to look
like we are not making this video any
longer than it needs to be alright fine
how about in the interest of time and to
keep my head on my shoulders we just run
one benchmark we do some load testing
just for thermals we'll do a quick run
of GTA 5 and we'll take a look at the
CPU GPU thermals after one run sound
good sounds great getting a lot of
support on my end so yeah let's let's do
that why don't why don't uh why don't
you guys while we run the benchmarks
while I run the benchmarks why don't you
guys enjoy the beauty and majesty that
is the RGB pumpkin PC
all right boys and girls I never thought
I'd say this but the pumpkin is finally
under load yes it's running Unigine
heaven 4.0 in the background as we speak
rest assured I'm not cheating the
pumpkin is doing all of this right now
there's about five or six cables coming
out the back and I also did make a
mistake from earlier it's not a core i5
eighty-six hundred K that I have in here
I was under the impression that I was
cool enough for Intel to send me one for
the coffee like lunch but no they
actually sent me a core i5 8400 so small
edit there that being said we're still
getting some pretty decent thermals all
things considered on the CPU we're
hitting 71 yep still at 71 degrees
Celsius max on the package with that
cryo rig c7 cooler and our GTX 10:50 TI
which is now the MSI card we've swapped
it out for the EVGA one that is not
overclocked
everything here is running stock that is
hitting 76 degrees Celsius max so
overall I mean I've seen worse thermals
on real actual cases so chassis
manufacturers if you're watching this
there's no excuse for your case to
deliver worse thermals than this pumpkin
right here there's just no excuse
and also it's fairly quiet I mean you
can't it's so thick that you can't hear
anything from the backside you can only
hear the noise emissions coming from its
face more or less and it's just a very
faint were very comfortable overall very
impressive little gaming PC pumpkin
thing whatever you want to call it
that's all for now folks thank you so
much for watching I hope you guys
enjoyed watching it if he did toss me a
look on the video and be sure to let me
know what you think about it in the
comments below feel free to get
subscribed as well to the channel for
more tech stuff coming at you really
soon and I will see all you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
