Omo right then I actually have some new
merchandise and still in stock like the
8-bit bit boy the 8-bit boy that's
awesome that's me this is actually
fan-made this is a fan-made design I
love the 8-bit style on a gaming destiny
love flamethrowers yes I mean it's you
know I was like practically born with
the flamethrower in my hands so go ahead
and buy those up guys
you get hella savings as well you can
buy that same design on a hoodie we also
have what look socal stars bit with tech
slash store yes hero come no no that's
nori - oh no that's hero it's hero oh
wow sorry my story's Paul's hardware net
I am also having a sale 10% off of
orders over 50 20% off orders over how
did it say Oh same deal there and we
have this new design has now been added
to some gaming desk mats yes so this is
the awesome hardware logo design also
fan-made also fan-made JTED did the
artwork on that one it's it's real cool
so that's available on some products now
Jake mouse pads and stuff so cool thanks
to all you guys who order stuff and
we'll shout out your name during the
after party indeed all right on that
note let's move on to news we've got
some articles to talk about starting
with the this one from hexxus about
Intel's comment like s apparently
prepping for a 10 core CPU cobalt Lake
huh what yes
comet Lake good old comet like s so
there's gonna be a main stream
apparently this is rumored from a
Taiwanese WCF tech forum member who
apparently overheard or had some
information from an Intel partner
meeting and was saying that Team Blue is
prepping a 10 core mainstream desktop
CPU for comet-like S which is gonna be
launching some time in 29 2019 we've
heard rumors that it could be as early
as q2
but it's it's exciting them the lesson
and probably more or less expected right
because they're probably trying to
to respond to AMD's of comings and to
family which I would assume is also
going to be trying to step up their core
count game their core and thread-count
game two perhaps 10 cores seems like the
logical next step so this is going to be
a part of the comment like s processors
manufactured on Intel's 14 nanometer + +
architecture so still no tendon either
we might have to wait for ice lake until
that we also have a we actually have a
number of concerns as well as soon as
these rumors started leaking out people
were concerned about well how are they
actually gonna cool this chip they're
already having certain issues cooling
the 9900 K which is only an 8 core 16
through at 16 thread chip how's it gonna
fare on a CPU that has two more cores
and four more threads if it's still on
the same 14 nanometer + + architecture
and you know I can't imagine that Intel
would release a CPU that's just that
disastrous thermals maybe at least you
could run it stock just fine I think
it's more of a matter of how well will
it overclock and be able to you know to
remain cool without having some sort of
exotic liquid liquid cooling solution or
exotic cooling solution in general
Lenovo as it turns out it kind of did it
oopsie and they released a spec sheet
prematurely
so she said showing 3/9 gens skews
further unreleased laptops now these are
all quad core 15 watt TDP and 2
megabytes of cache per core also we
don't know exactly if these are based on
the 14 nanometer + + comment Lake S or
if we're looking at potentially 10
nanometer ice Lake chips
so they got a screenshot they're just
kind of a little bit of a whoop so from
from from Lenovo you know these
companies slipped from time to time we
don't really know much about comet like
guess just rumors we have no idea how
credible this this Taiwanese leaker is I
just need to be leaking on everything
but hopefully some things will be
clarified during CES just around the
corner that's very soon so let's move on
trade war strikes again
you know particularly for the United
States see sonic I really like see sonic
they make great power supplies sadly
they had to announce recently that
they're seeing a whole price increase
due to tariffs u.s. tariffs that
President Trump has imposed on the US
they're seeing some some gnarly price
increases on their entire product line
I shouldn't say it's super gnarly it's
you know the the prices vary the price
hikes vary depending on the model and
they range anywhere from five to twelve
percent but that could be that could be
substantial for a lot of budget builders
out there for sure
and in his statement the company's
chairman and CEO Vincent Chang noted
that the important noted the importance
of transparency with consumers and
partners regarding the dynamic economic
conditions that the United States is
currently faced with in his statement he
said effective first of December 2018
that is in four days that is it soon so
starting in four days in Sainik USA keep
talking even though I'm still here the
beauty of LOB's see sonic USA is to
increase the MSRP for all power supplies
manufactured in China and destined for
the US market this is the result of
recent market developments but all
orders placed prior to this date shall
follow current pricing which is why I'm
really glad that I ordered my s2 my s12
to see sonic power supply just yesterday
actually from new egg and I got a steal
on it for Cyber Monday I think I got it
for like 39 bucks
I shouldn't say it's a steal it's only
like a 45 dollar power supply otherwise
that's 12 - yeah but the s12 - I looked
it up on Johnny guru the other day it's
got its got like a nine point seven
rating or something like that on Johnny
guru for like a forty dollar power
supply it's it's amazing so I actually
have some cool plans with that unit I
know how exciting compared supplies be
but stay tuned it'll be interesting so
it's kind of a bummer to see you know
companies like C Sonic and I respect
that they're super transparent about all
this but it's still kind of unfortunate
to see them having to like raise the
MSRP and sort of maybe you know
disappoint some customers but at least
they're being honest about it and this
is just about 20 20 bucks increase per
almost across the board yeah yeah and
like I said that can
that's actually quite significant when
you consider how affordable or cheap
some of these some of these power
supplies are originally 20 bucks doesn't
seem like a huge price hike but when the
unit's already only $40 2000 our price
hike is you know that's a huge
percentage so um whereas guys $200 units
that's actually less than the
theoretical 25 percent that the tariffs
are supposed to increase to right in
January yeah exactly maybe maybe see
Sonics being the good guy there and like
eating a bit of that yeah could be
better that cost could be so if you were
in the market for a see some power
supply or just any power supply really
and you should definitely consider see
stomach you might want to snag one of
those within the next four days before
the prices go up or it gives the r-tx 20
atti
the whole water force treatment look at
that this article from hexxus got a
couple articles from Hex's today Thank
You hexxus so this is actually a fully
you know custom it's got a custom block
on there from Oris looks very nice
what's nice yeah I think they've spent
some time designing it and you know
let's make something that looks good
I like that they've sort of embraced
this logo the Hawker Falken whatever
that bird theme is yeah it's it's it's
somewhat distinct and you know I feel
like they're kind of taking that design
it I think and you know this looks like
a wing right that's a wing yeah maybe
yeah totally
okay or the ROG eye or the ROG no no no
definitely not completely unique and
totally different branded but this thing
has 19 power phases 16 going to the GPU
3 to the memory it has an ASA tech 240
millimeter radiator included with of
course a pair of 120 millimeter RGB fan
so that's nice it's not just a water
block on a GPU that they've put in a box
it's a fully integrated all-in-one
solution with the with the hoses with
the radiator and the fans I kind of like
that it's got an RGB shroud
it's got RGB backplate as you can see
there and there's RGB of course on the
side that seems to be you know it's
pretty it's pretty a pretty par for the
course for 2018 here we also have
dedicated heat sinks for memory and
MOSFETs GPU boost going from the
of reference or fifteen hundred and
forty five megahertz to seventeen
hundred and seventy megahertz and you
could probably get away with quite a bit
more than that when you're overclocking
this thing on on liquid they've also
added two HDMI outputs to the reference
video outs so you now have the option of
doing like three HDMI and one
DisplayPort
or you could do three DisplayPort and
one HDMI well all the while and using
that that USB type-c for you know just
virtual link or whatever it is no
sacrifice is there
I think they mainly do that to provide
more HDMI outs for people who are doing
VR setups sure which can be useful I
think in a niche scenario yeah it does
seem a little bit less useful now that
there's the just the VR link right the
air link a virtual virtual link right
that's available and said although the
VR headsets currently use virtual link
yet so right anyway though that's nice
nice looking card there sure it's only
gonna cost about two thousand dollars
yeah no shit so given the brace
yourselves atti availability and markups
and exactly all that brace your wallets
now getting two hundred twenty
millimeter fans at a to I mean that's it
okay next thing we have an article from
overclocked 3d net Coolermaster has
somehow managed to launch addressable
RGB hard tubing oh good
cuz we need it in our lives my life was
not complete until this product came
around this is clearly an add-on product
that's designed to fit around hard
tubing so it's not hard to being itself
it's sort of like a skeleton that you
put hard tubing into or around and then
it creates RGB magic right now it's only
available in Asia I'm sorry you all
pulled out your wallets for no reason if
you're not in Asia right now it's only
available in Asia in limited quantities
so even in Asia it's it's hard to find
so this is who knows if this is going to
make it to the Western market each
addressable RGB to
is 3d printed to meet the exact length
requirements of custom water cooling
enthusiasts so it seems like it's
something that you got an order and like
kind of how you go to the the cable my
Pro Series cables or cable mod cables
and you know customize the the length of
your sleeves and stuff like that seems
like a similar thing here you actually
have to tell them how long you want each
piece to be based on based on your
system which i think is also kind of
like you really have to know what you're
doing to give them an exact measurement
and be like this is this is how long it
should be and for it to fit perfectly
could've sworn I saw an Emmitt like a
video or yeah I can't I can't find it
though I want to show people what it
looks like yeah and it's on yeah and I'm
pretty sure I saw that and like a
Twitter tweet or something if anyone has
it in chat feel free to blow it up no
the fact that these are 3d printed you
know there is there's an upshot here
even if you're not in the Far East is
that you could potentially actually you
could make this yourself if you have a
3d printer and in RGB strip or two so
that's that's kind of cool you know and
that seems to be very much the
coolermaster way these days it's just
sort of like you know make it yourself
to do DIY and all that stuff oh look the
cooler master page has some pictures
here so so yeah it's just sort of a
frame she's here and then the LEDs go in
behind it right and then those light I
have no idea how it's actually I have no
idea how the the strips are actually
powered if you just sort of hide the
wire behind the tubing and the fittings
and stuff you have to route it oddly I'm
not sure where the power source can't
really see from this angle yeah it's
hard it's hard to tell I'd love to get
my hands on one of these us also of note
is that it seems to be a fixed length
right so you can only do like this
specific length of tubing well no
apparently you can like that order it
you can make an order specific lengths
yes yeah you can order specific lengths
or it doesn't it doesn't say you can
order specific lengths but it does say
that they are 3d printed to meet exact
length requirements of custom water
coolers so either cool
coolermaster will do it for you and you
just input whatever length you want or
it's purely a DIY thing and they're just
uploading the whatever schematic
whatever you call it for people who have
3d printers and you can print it out
yourself I'm not sure the article didn't
specify which way it goes but at any
rate even if you're in the u.s. you
could apparently make this yourself the
only thing is is that it's recommended
that you use white coolant with this
product and then that makes sense
because if you use a colored coolant
it's gonna change up the colors of the
LEDs themselves gonna sort of dilute it
or make it all twisted and if you use
just clear regular let's say distilled
water then you could probably see the
the actual LED hotspots through the
tubing and that probably won't look
super great so but you'll have
incredibly awesome addressable RGB fluid
so who cares so how's it powered and
also can you make this Bend can you do
bends that's the other question I had
RDR you resorted to only using fittings
to make your bends and you have to do
all straight piping I'm not sure the
problem like I don't know just with hard
tubing and bends like it's completely
variable the size and shape of each bin
so I feel like you'd have to do it you'd
have to be like a really good at 3d
printing and like do your bends first
and then like scan em so you could like
exactly 3d print right to match your
baby frame that that'd be pretty fancy I
mean the other thing is the other thing
that I was thinking is how if you did if
the if it did support like bent bent
tubes
how would you actually route the LED
strips to make that Bend
do you mean because ideally like that if
you were putting on your case you put
the LEDs directly behind the tube right
yes but if it was extending to a turn to
a bend then how would you route that you
would have to you'd have to like sort of
twist the RGB strip a little bit and I
don't know I know exactly how that would
fly I can't even begin to conceptualize
right what you're talking about this is
so complicated it really is you know
Elon Musk should maybe take a whack it
you know perfecting this art but let's
move on we've got a couple more stories
here next up this is also from
overclocked 3d net and they were talking
about bitcoin lately because because no
one really cares about bitcoin right now
and that is due to the fact that it is
worth a fraction a fraction of what it
was at the beginning of 2012 alright now
it's down like in 2017 forty percent or
something at the beginning of 2018 or
the end of 2017 at the end of 2017 the
value of Bitcoin reached $17,000 at its
peak and now I should say at the
beginning of this month it was valued at
just a mere sixty three hundred dollars
and if you're looking at it today at
least at the time of writing this
article bitcoin was valued at just a
single Bitcoin was valued at just $3,600
Wow so seventeen thousand to thirty six
hundred that's a big drop let's come way
down a lot of let a lot of analysts are
saying that it may go down even further
so this is really bad news for a lot of
miners but great news for the PC
enthusiasts market because there's no
longer a mining related demand for GPUs
in particular and so as we've seen
mainstream GPUs have actually the prices
for them have started to normalize they
have been normalizing for quite some
time now since that mining based demand
has has lessened up so that's great also
you know mining mining systems require
more than just GPUs they also require
CPUs albeit they don't have to be high
powered low powered CPUs will work just
fine in most mining cases and also it's
and also DRAM in power supplies so the
pricing for those components have been
affected as well over the last year due
to the mining craze so now that there's
not as much of a demand for you know
consumer based mining operations we're
actually seeing a decrease in a
normalization of prices across the board
not just with GPUs but with entry-level
or low-cost processors power supplies
and and D
in particular so altogether this is bad
news if you're a minor and great news if
you're a PC builder I guess I guess you
should you know buy up some PC parts
while you can while they're hot
even though analysts are projecting that
you know we're not gonna see some sudden
uptick in in a Bitcoin value anytime
soon so that's it was really it was
really I don't want oh
scary's not the right word just really
like disheartening just how expensive
certain parts got at its worst you know
yeah earlier this year's like dances
just really how long is this gonna be
yeah beginning of the year was it's
really lame it was terrible I couldn't
make content does again I can't
recommend go buy a console to build this
computer see you maybe tutorial I'm
gonna buy a console part yield for a
thousand bucks last year and that's like
1500 most terrible I was so terrible
alright so we're gonna we're going to
transition a little bit now this is
still part of the same new segment but
we have a couple gaming stories not
enough to really warrant its own
dedicated segment but we only have two
more stories here and they're both
gaming related so ones from hot hardware
and this is regarding the fallout 76
debacle that a lot of people are unhappy
with so if you guys haven't heard the
news have you heard about this
yes okay fall at 76 launched the launch
for this game was a huge fail it had
significant just a significant amount of
bugs that were just more than just
little bugs a lot of glitches there was
a massive day one patch that was
actually larger than the game itself
people had to wait for four hours to
play the stupid game because it was so
broken the reviews for one were terrible
Amazon even dropped the price of this
game by $25 which is unheard of for a
triple a game that's only been out a
couple weeks it's insane
so one redditor after all this reported
that bethesda had gave him a refund
after he complained about how shitty
this experience was and the story blew
up but bethesda then denied refunds to
everyone
else who asked for a refund I really was
just a one-off only the first person to
ask actually gets the refund that seems
fair to me and to be fair I guess
somewhat in Bethesda Thesz does defense
it does say on their support page that
you don't get a refund if the code has
already been delivered if the game codes
already been delivered sorry we don't
accept refunds it does say that there so
it seems like he just did this first guy
solid and then you know middle fingers
up to everyone else they did say that
but there's there's another school of
thought here migliozzi oh and Rathod LLP
totally butchered that I'm sure from
Washington DC they're saying they're
lawyers and shit they're saying that
fallout 76 is heavily glitched and
virtually unplayable and Bethesda's
refusal to honor refunds for an
unplayable game it falls under deceptive
trade practices oh yeah so even if you
have it in your Terms of Service or you
guys said you we don't we told you up
front that we don't accept refunds this
lawyer firm is saying this law firm
saying well yeah but this is different
because your game doesn't even work so
this is just this is just unfair no
legal action has been taken against
Bethesda as of yet regarding the matter
but we'll have to wait and see how this
all works out it really does suck if you
were super looking forward to fallout 76
I know if there were a few people who
were hyping it up and stuff and it's
it's always a bummer when you spend you
know 60 bucks on a game that you think
is gonna be be awesome and it just isn't
especially when you can't get your money
back and it's a it's a clear violation
of the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness indeed
everything pulsing and then we have one
more article here from GameSpot about
Red Dead online they did a good job
outlined new details
make it stop
oh wait I hit pause right everyone saw
me hit pause oh oh ads don't pause these
like I hit the pause button that's just
for fun that's just I just wanted to
amuse you
there's more like clarify have to watch
the whole ad now there's at least a few
hundred if not a few thousand witnesses
to the fact that I hit pause immediately
on the ad it was just like fuck you I'm
gonna keep playing it really whooping
I'm gonna put a play button here to make
you think I really might play it'll stop
everything thanks games box games
moving on sorry Kathleen yes of course
so the beta for a rated redemption to
online has gone live for ps4 and Xbox
one it was lunch today
but access has only been rolled out to
select players or gamers those
particularly who have purchased the read
of redemption to Ultimate Edition are
able to try out the new online version
today but for public access you had you
had to already bought the ultimate
edition or can you like buy it now now
that you know that this is a perk um
Ableton edition I'm sure I'm sure if you
have if you buy it now you could
probably play it today as well but
fortunately if you don't want to spend
that extra dough or if you just have
already bought the game regularly
there's gonna be full public access by
November 30th so they're rolling out
availability for this for online slowly
throughout the week and hopefully by the
end of the week everyone will be able to
join for you know for no cost or
anything like that now there are a lot
of well I should also mention that the
reason why they're doing it that way is
to just help ease the game into beta and
it also helps mitigate a lot of major
issues that online play might experience
otherwise you know if they have everyone
just like hop into the servers all at
once it could break the game could crash
things and they'll be frantic trying to
figure it out it actually makes a lot
more sense that they're slowly just sort
of tapering tapering the whole process
maybe like the Dark Portal and Burning
Crusade launched that is exactly the
reference and metaphor I was going to
use but you still for me
good job online features include you can
create your own
character that's fun you can customize
your abilities online and Orab sorry you
can customize your abilities in line
with with your play style so that's
actually kind of interesting I'm kind of
curious to see how they've set that all
up you can venture into the world alone
just go solo like a like a badass cowboy
or you can Posse up with up to seven yes
