gonna help us you can help us move boxes
you're definitely not gonna help us
suck oh no no I want to curl up in a
corner and cry we have about 16 of these
boxes that weigh anywhere from 50 to 150
pounds so you also got a bunch of stuff
in the office that can't really be boxed
because it's either too big or an
awkward shape we do have a u-haul for
all the big stuff today and it's just
wifey sauce and I had tackling all this
by herself this is all just our personal
stuff from my grandparents place
tomorrow is where we do the actual
studio where there's like 40 boxes and
we're actually hiring professional
movers for all that crap so tomorrow
should be a little less stressful today
is like our big move day as far as how
much physical labor might be sauce and I
are actually responsible for so today is
hell day no all right we're on our way
to the u-haul pickup now I'm gonna go
pick up a 15-footer I'm gonna jump in
the truck and drive it back home
my wife is also goes to get us coffee so
that we both survive the day and then at
that point once we're both reconvened at
that my grandparents place we'll start
loading the truck because that's how
moving works
oh we're here uooo uooo do you think
these have Android auto which trucks
ours got the keys to my brand-new car
ain't she a beauty start er up oh yeah
that's the sound of a beast I just had
multiple orgasms okay we got the u-haul
in our driveway we're good to go let's
start moving some boxes
ah we did it we moved everything good
job honey we knocked it out of the park
yeah she's over everything that should
be moving today is officially in the
truck is actually pretty smooth the
hardest thing by far was the couch
because the couch is it only splits up
into two parts and one part is just a
little Ottoman so the other part is like
the long like the majority of the couch
had to go down the stairs and with just
wifey salsa nein we did a pretty good
job but we did we did mark up a little
bit to the of the wall there fortunately
we plan to give my grandparents a very
generous security deposit so they can
replace all the carpet or repaint the
walls as needed and everything should be
hunky-dory it is about noon and we're
hungry we're tired sweaty and hungry so
we're gonna go have lunch why we were so
hungry I completely forgot to even vlog
our food when it was still here but it's
clearly clearly enjoyed and devoured
quickly picks up the coleslaw I didn't
really like the coleslaw look at this
millennial hang for a lunch with a
tablet I think you're so cool don't you
alright come back in the u-haul so at
this point wifey sauce is gonna follow
me in her personal vehicle we're gonna
head to the new house and unload all
this crap and I have to make sure to
drive very carefully so I don't destroy
all of it
yeah my grandpa's house it's really
weird with all of our bedrooms empty
kind of a
actually last night I cut my grandma
crying it's still crying trying not to
show it really but she was crying a
little bit she was watching Heather and
I had packed up our stuff I've been
living with them since 2014 it's been
four years and I think this move is
hitting me a little bit harder than I
thought it would it's definitely hitting
them when I saw her crying there I went
over and tried to comfort her and you
know I reassured her that Heather and I
are gonna visit often and we'll still
see each other but you know deep down
because of Taylor that
was never going to be the same so it's
really tough leaving the behind in that
mostly empty house now you know it's
just part of life new chapters begin and
old ones end its
definitely better sweet
all right I think this is the freeway
hey who's that cutie
oh she's kind of psycho yeah let's let's
just let's not look over that money okay
we're all we're all moved in everything
went really smoothly white piece ounce
and I are an awesome team and everything
from my grandparents house is now in
this house also the paint the paint is
done in the entire house except for the
living room that needs a lot of work so
leave just give you the quick
five-second tour here
wifey sauce is already taking full
advantage of the couch we just moved in
but look at this remember this room
remember this room I already showed you
guys the floor in one of the previous
vlogs but now look at it with the paint
the paint and the floors and the floors
and the paint it's it looks like a brand
new house it looks completely different
it's like a real mess now we're at
target because we have to get some
cleaning supplies before we could start
unpacking all of our things back at the
house so we're trying to decide what the
best wet mop would be we've boiled it
down to these two options we've got the
Rubbermaid Rubbermaid for $19.99 and
what's the other one either the libman
the libman not this one but the bisque I
see they both have the the water inserts
this one is twenty two forty nine
alright wifey sauce is gonna do a test
really quick
this is the libman alright test it out
babe how's it feel handle quality
sprayer is there water in there why is
there water already in there that's
weird
alright now do not try the Rubbermaid
let me give it a shot
oh yeah it actually feels pretty like
the joints the joint of where the mop
head is feels pretty secure you know
this one it feels too stiff I feel like
I'm gonna get carpal tunnel after a
while okay wife wife likes the green one
so we're going with the green one I like
the green one too my opinion matters too
damn it you're right I'm sorry
more important than choosing the mop
though what are we gonna drink while
we're using the mop yeah that's
difficult we could make me tea lattes
with it later and we have a lemon tree
so we can put our own lemons inside the
beer well you can do lemon - I'm an
equal-opportunity citrus drinker okay I
couldn't resist I'm getting the sixty
Minute IPA as well doctor said it was
good stuff alright so we just got to the
new house and we were planning to
actually clean a bunch of stuff because
they're still like these these floors
are still riddled with dust and then
we're actually gonna like redistribute
all the boxes into the rooms that they
belong in and then like unpack and like
build our bed and stuff like that and
then we realized it's 8 p.m. and we just
had like a 15 hour day and we're both
super wiped out so we're gonna save that
for later plus some of the
don't even have lights in them yet which
means it would be almost impossible to
clean or move stuff into them also quick
update look at the nest I remove the
trim back plates either was here before
reinstalled it looks a lot cleaner now
we don't have internet here yet though
so there's no Wi-Fi connected it's
really pretty but until we get it on a
network it's dumber than a pile of rocks
okay I'm tired let's go home wow you're
gonna agree with me just like that who
are you who the hell are you
impostor alright we're back at my
grandparents place it's a it's late at
night now so we're gonna go to bed wake
up early in the morning head to the
office and meet the movers who are going
to be moving everything that's in our
studio to the new house so it's gonna be
another long day but should be fine
good night alright it's a brand new day
and this is what one of our office rooms
looks like now pretty much pax is where
we decide to put all the furniture and
we've got some fragile boxes here we've
got fully built systems in these boxes
these are all computer cases that we're
giving away for free tomorrow I actually
tweeted out a list of all these cases
and told people you know first-come
first-serve oh okay the movers are here
moves are here the other box is right
there okay let's go we're gonna
clearance oh alright it's been about
half an hour since the guy started and
they are making a serious dent they
already moved all the boxes that were in
this room which were the heaviest boxes
that all came from our storage room so
that was all the computer parts so
everything's coming along really well
alright almost everything is packed up
we just have a few more items here a
little bit of furniture the end to elite
bills
be very expensive but also super heavy
high-end system that I built a while ago
with two gtx 1080p eyes which is why i
have it written here this side up so the
GPUs are sort of vertical and not
horizontal I want to try to minimize the
risk of them getting damaged in transit
as well as leaking this is we didn't
have time to actually drain the loop so
there's still two custom loops inside of
this bill so hopefully it makes it out
of this move unscathed and once these
last items are loaded up into the truck
we'll be on our way to the new house
all right we have everything moved in
the movers just left every single thing
that we own in our lives is now in this
house holy freaking moly and now we get
to unpack a little bit yay
is there is there someone we can hire to
do that too judging from the silence of
wifey sauce I'm guessing that too no all
right so we actually unpacked quite a
bit but there's still a lot that we need
to do this room which was almost
entirely full is now partially empty
which is a good thing and same with this
room we actually cleared out a lot of
boxes and put them in the appropriate
places
YV sauce is currently working on the
family room it's a little dark in here
but maybe I can shine a light here yeah
how's it going honey it's very tiring
but the plant looks good I think we
should leave it right there this is the
shooting room we got two tables moved in
here we got the up desk that's gonna be
nice and I'm also gonna shoot b roll
here is is also where awesome hardware
is gonna be shot with paul and i'm not
exactly sure what to do with the
background here because the deal is my
last set had a table like a table just
like this one back here against the wall
where i was able to have a system and a
couple ultra wide monitors that's no
longer the case because the room is
limited on space i'm really not sure
what to do on this wall here to sort of
make it look nice for the videos for the
set in general if you guys have any
ideas of what I should put on this wall
let me know over here we have well it's
kind of hard to see there's no light in
here yet but you can sort of see what
we've done with the office so far but
you can see here we have three desks set
up somewhat set up already the one on
the corner there with two monitors is
mine mine my pcs right there we've got
wifey sauces desk and the third
companion desk that might go to Chris if
Chris continues to help us out with
editing and shooting but it's looking
pretty good in here so far and then
we've got our bedroom king-size bed
right there super comfy actually this
mattress was donated by wifey sauces
grandma thank you very much see oh and
and Larry sorry checking on things we
also have the TV TVs probably gonna get
wall-mounted right here BAM bathroom
bathroom stuff you know it's a bathroom
we still haven't put the fixtures on yet
but
eventually and then we've got yeah
closet space specific oh and a ladder
we're gonna keep the ladder in here as
well I think it's just you know it's
romantic it says a lot about us as a
couple
we're always striving to reach new
heights as a team
true love is just a step away but that's
how it's coming along so far the house
is really looking nice I'm super excited
with what's been done so far and what
still has yet to be done I'm gonna end
the vlog here guys
thanks so much for watching stay tuned
for more I'll see you guys in the next
