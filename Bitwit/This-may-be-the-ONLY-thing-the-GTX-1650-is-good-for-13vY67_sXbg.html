the day of launch for the GTX 1650 and
this video was not going up on launch
day because in video for some odd reason
decided not to release their drivers for
this card to the press until the embargo
lifted which is first time I've ever
seen it done that way but that's a
completely different topic we can go on
and on about that still I'm going to be
playing around with the GTX 16:50 today
and showing off potentially its greatest
feature which is the fact that it can
run without the PCIe connector gets all
of its power straight through the PCIe
slot it's a 75 watt TDP chip runs a very
low power is very power efficient so it
can easily drop into systems that have
weak power supplies or ones that have no
free PCIe connectors and potentially
ones that are running on integrated
graphics to hopefully breathe new life
into a dying system so that's exactly
what we're doing today to see if we can
actually turn it into a relatively
decent and playable gaming PC now I
actually have my hands computer this is
their old family computer but it's a
little too old it's like 1011 years old
it's an HP Pavillion probably a Core 2
Duo or something like that I kind of
forget but to my disappointment PCI
slots no PCI Express it's too old so
it's not gonna work which is why I took
it to Craigslist and this is the PC that
I landed on this is a Dell Vostro dello
stato 470 pre-built with an Intel Core
i5 at 3.1 gigahertz it doesn't list the
actual model but a quick Google search
reveals Dell valestra 470 that this is
potentially a core i5 3450 a 3.1
gigahertz base clock quad core quad core
processor on the h77 chipset that's
actually not too bad we also have 8 gigs
of memory presumably ddr3 750 gig hard
drive Wi-Fi HDMI bluetooth Windows 10
until HD graphics no mention of a
discrete GPU here in the listed price
one hundred and ninety five dollars but
being the crafty salesman I am I talked
him down to a hundred and fifty actually
no I just asked him right out of the
gate can you do 150 and he said yes so
that means with this 150 dollar GPU
we're essentially putting together a 300
dollar system and seeing just how well
we can game on looks like we actually
have to meet him right now it's its skin
30 so let's go buy a computer all right
we got the PC the transaction went very
smoothly the guy was super nice I didn't
really know much about the system in
case you're curious I think it was his
sisters but his sister since moved to
Mexico and has no need for the system
anymore so he sold it to me so
150 bucks for a quad core i5 even though
it is third gen this prebuilt must have
come out around 2012 in that case and
it's actually in fairly decent shape for
being 7 years old I mean it's got you
know normal signs of wear and tear some
scuffs but overall it looks pretty good
and I even took a look inside while I
was at the guys place but I'll show you
guys as well so here's a look pretty
standard looking for a prebuilt cable
management is virtually non-existent
three bins right here one two three so
I'm guessing two of them are two gigs
and then one's a four gig stick because
we have eight in total here's our basic
little CPU cooler with our core i5 3450
quad core CPU base clock of 3.1 with a
max turbo up to 3.5 gigahertz just below
we have our single ECI Express by 16
slide but one is all we need we are good
to go there there's the chipset our
little h77 Express chipset doesn't even
need a heatsink what a baller
please look it look it leave this mSATA
it's gonna insert a slot that's cool
SATA hard drive 750 gigs and I looked it
up at 7200 rpm we do get the standard
SATA connections no IDE here that was a
little bit before its time this is a 350
watt unit which is actually perfect
because the GTX 1650 has a minimum power
supply requirement of 300 watts so right
on the money there it does have a spare
6 pin PCI II connector but we'll just
we'll just ignore that besides I know
there are pre volts out there that have
similar specs that do not have extra
connectivity for a discrete GPU so this
is still for all intensive purposes a
pretty good example of the kind of
system somebody might consider upgrading
with the gtx 1650 and it looks like
we've got some optical drives here let's
take a look okay that is a DVD combo
drive okay so card reader 2 USB 3 2 USB
2 look at the back 4 USB 2 2 USB 3 or je
45 Ethernet LAN port d-sub HDMI s/pdif
out then we have a multi-channel audio
not too bad actually
overall it's in fairly good shape and
while it is dirty quill dusty and stuff
it's actually not I've seen a lot worse
ok I think we're finally ready to
install the GTX 1650 let's fire it up
all right we are finally ready to game
and I say finally because it actually
took a lot longer than you might imagine
to get to this point after I installed
the video card let me briefly talk about
the the process really quick so after I
installed the discrete GPU our GTX 16:50
I immediately uninstalled it because I
want to initially boot the system
without a video card just as is so I can
take a closer look at the system and see
what we were working with I did test the
system powered on at Craigslist dude's
house but I didn't want to spend too
much time or linger because I was in the
middle of his living room and stuff so I
powered on the system and it booted
straight into Windows 10 Pro no problem
it's worth noting that this system
originally shipped with Windows 7 so
it's been updated since and it looked to
be a clean install there were no user
files the C Drive was pretty much empty
which is exactly what you should do if
you're gonna sell a used PC you should
definitely wipe the drive first
so that also was nice to see plus I
didn't have to worry about any kind of
malicious or suspicious files left over
by the previous admin once I checked out
everything and it looked pretty good to
go and all in order I powered the system
down then reinstalled our GTX 16:50
powered back up and got a black screen I
went to the splash screen for a minute
and then completely black which
indicates that we need a BIOS update
uninstall the discrete GPU
thought I could actually boot into
Windows again downloaded the latest bios
from the Dells port page which was from
2018 a hell of a lot more recent than
the one that was on here and then ran
the executable file in Windows was
actually the first time in a while that
I've updated a BIOS straight from a
Windows environment the BIOS update was
a success
so I powered down the system before
reinstalling the discrete GPU again
rebooting and this time we went straight
into Windows 10 no problem but then
began the long series of Windows updates
getting us to build 1809 took four or
five maybe six hours I would assume
because I left it overnight so we got up
to build 1809 that allowed us to install
the GeForce drivers because the system
was so out of date and video drivers
wouldn't even take so once that was done
we were finally ready to game I guess
this is all to say that if you have an
aging desktop and you're planning to pop
a brand new GPU in there it might not
necessarily be so plug-and-play there
may be several steps that you need to
take along the way in order to get your
build up to speed so that it plays
nicely with your brand new graphics card
the last optional step I did here was
overclocking our G
16:50 obviously the cpu has a luck
multiplier so it can't be overclocked
but I did dial in a really quick and
conservative 100 megahertz core clock
offset and a 600 megahertz memory clock
offset on the GPU and then and only then
where we finally ready to game actually
we are ready to game we are now in
present time let's jump into a freaking
game so we're starting with doom here at
1920 by 1080 and if you look over here
we are using the OpenGL API at ultra
settings pretty ambitious for a $300
Frankenstein PC but let's see how it
goes ok so there's no enemies here let
me just run around in this empty room
for a minute here so I'm not distracted
so you can see that GPU utilization is
hovering in the 80s and 90s not fully
maxed out which I suppose is a good sign
it means we're not completely at the end
of our rope here
CPU is also at around looks like about
80 80 % or so which is also fantastic it
means that we're not bottlenecking on
our CPU otherwise it would be closer to
a hundred even our system memory is
hanging in there eating up around 5 to 6
gigs of ddr3 and our frame rates are
looking pretty darn strong in the 80 to
100 FPS range but let's let's go into a
different environment here a different
scene and see if things change you can
see here that we're still getting around
80 fps and that's a you know prone
fluctuate but it's looking pretty good
here are our GPU is not being taxed to
its fullest which means we even have a
some additional headroom there notice
the VRAM usage right now is about 3 gigs
which is getting a little close to that
4 gig limit but we do still have some
overhead there temperatures are looking
pretty safe as well in the 70s oh I died
actually it's more like in the high 60s
hardly topping 70 C so that's not too
bad either oh ok this is a good
time to I'm gonna actually see what
happens if we go up to 2560 by 1440 no
promises here could very well suck
completely alright ok we have definitely
dropped our framerate as expected but
hey still still in the 50s and 60s and
still feeling very playable
oh-ho-ho you can see our GPU is much
closer to full utilization now that's
actually going to take a little
the stress off of our CPU as we become
more GPU bound our VRAM usage hasn't
really gone up much though it's still
hovering around not a little over three
gigs I'm really impressed that we're
running this smoothly at 1440p without a
hitch subjectively this is a great
gaming experience and for the money it's
a fantastic one I mean if someone told
me that I was gaming on a thousand
dollar PC right now there's nothing that
I can see that would indicate otherwise
I would completely believe them so
overall I'm very happy with how this is
looking so far well let's jump into
another game Resident Evil 2 the remake
1920 by 1080 we're using a blend of high
and actually just mostly high settings
there's a quick gander there alright so
it looks like we're getting pretty good
frame rates here in the 80s and 90s but
of course that's gonna change now we're
seeing much different behavior here than
we did in doom because if you look at
our CPU utilization it's at 100 that's a
CPU bottleneck so our GPU is writing
checks that our CPU can't cache it's
just working a little too fast for it so
we are gonna suffer a little bit of
performance there it's hard to say
exactly how much but you can see our GPU
is still doing some work you know it's
not it's not sitting back chillaxing
it's actually pretty close to 100%
utilization at times as well we're
pushing the boundaries a little bit more
with our VRAM usage not by a whole lot I
here at three point five gigs just a
little bit of room to spare there and we
still have plenty of system memory to go
around
oh hello liquor please don't oh geez
okay this is why I bought the infinite
rocket launchers I'd be off yeah how do
you like it instead at 70 FPS died yep
so that oh hello coach I didn't know you
had a friend oh okay it's a quite a
range here we've seen anywhere from 50
to 90 FPS depending on where we are the
framerate in this game really goes down
when you're in lighter environments
because there's obviously more detail
that needs to be rendered but still
looking very strong Oh fancy seeing you
here mr. X I didn't know you like to
read yeah we should we should do a book
club or something like that sometime oh
what's that you're you're invincible but
you can't jump over tables that's that's
funny oh my god I love playing musical
chairs too you know your footsteps are
really loud for a library alright you're
done buddy
or is it sleepy time for mr. rags
all right well mr. X is taking a break
let's switch over to one last game oh
god he's awake
Altaf or tomb raider tomb raider her
shadow is always on who whoa hey hey
that's a choppy choppy scene let's let's
let's change this here oh no wonder
1440p okay let's change that to 1920 by
1080
looks like directx12 is on and our
graphics are on hi
let's just see what hi looks like oh oh
oh 30 FPS still despite lowering our
resolution our frame rate has remained
unchanged and look at that GPU
utilization at 99% means we are
definitely GPU bound heavily GPU bounder
our CPUs just still kind of dancing
around waiting for the GPU going what's
going on graphics card what's going on
1650 I'm here for you I'm ready what's
what's the holdup
well these polygons are much harder to
render than the last two games we played
so I'm having a little bit of a time
here chill out CPU we are pretty GPU
bottlenecked at the moment so this is
also a good example that the setup
similar to this one may not be powerful
enough to drive modern-day triple-a
titles not all of them anyway at least
at high settings let's see if we can get
this more playable here let's drop you
to low okay something a little bit more
manageable around 45 fps okay not the
greatest but definitely a lot smoother
though because now we're dipping into
the low 40s high 30s as opposed to in
the 20s where things get super choppy it
looks like our GPU is still pretty maxed
out here so I think if we wanted a
better chance at running modern triple-a
titles with this system perhaps we
should go for a faster graphics card
something like a gtx 1660 for example
but then you run into the potential
issue of cpu bottlenecking if your GPUs
too fast then the CPU can't keep up with
it and it's kind of hard to know where
that line is without testing it
firsthand I think these last few
playthroughs also demonstrate that the
four gigs of video memory on this card
are sufficient for 1080p gaming still
here in 2019 at least for the majority
of titles all right people let's let's
have some closing words here let's break
it down
so overall I had an enjoyable time
gaming with the gtx 1650 in this old
system that's been seemingly resurrected
as a gaming rig but we can't ignore the
fact that the RX 570 from AMD is still
the faster GPU and it's cheaper so it's
it's roughly 5 to 10 percent faster in
some of the benchmarks that I was
looking at
line and at the time of filming the
lowest you can find a brand new rx 574
is a hundred and twenty nine us that's
20 dollars cheaper than the GTX 1650 and
it's faster so it makes 100% sense if
your power supply supports it to buy the
rx 570 that essentially makes the GTX
1650 a last resort you don't buy the GTX
1650 because you want to you buy it
because you have to it's kind of like if
you had to build a computer but the only
screwdriver you had was on a Swiss Army
knife you'd be glad that you had the
option but it wouldn't be your first
choice certainly not one that you'd
suggest for right out of the gate having
said that if the conditions are
appropriate the gtx 1650 today has shown
that it can give your old system a new
purpose as an entry level gaming PC and
I'll leave it at that guys let me know
what you think about it in the comments
below and if you just want to see some
straight good benchmarks on the gtx 1650
compared against other cards with graphs
and all that i'll put some links to some
other youtubers down below guys like
steve from gamers nexus steve from
hardware at box all the Steve's just
follow all the Steve's and I'll add
other links as I see them but that's
gonna do for me guys thank you so much
for watching this video toss a like cut
before you go and get subscribe for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon
have a good one guys I will see you all
