awesomesauce news today i will be
reviewing this mechanical gaming
keyboard from Roseville this is their RK
90 100 and this particular model that I
had with me here today features the
Cherry MX blue switches you can also get
this keyboard in a different model that
features Cherry MX brown switches but I
will be comparing the two of those
momentarily in this video so I also want
to point out at least at the time of
filming this video this keyboard has
been sold out on Newegg for a very long
time and I just checked today and its
back in stock oh yeah so I figured it
would be an appropriate time to do a
review on this board so with that said
let's take a closer look
alright so pawn opening up the box you
will find your users manual and keyboard
itself of course and I believe that's it
yeah and honestly there's not much else
you really need with the keyboard these
days other than a little documentation
perhaps but here it is Wow worst
unveiling ever there's a keyboard in all
of its glory here's a 6 foot more or
less a 6 foot braided cable for your
keyboard and the 6 foot 6 feet is kind
of long for for a keyboard in my opinion
but Rosewall has added a nice velcro
strap for you to manage that excess
cable you can see here we've got two
gold plated USB connectors and you're
wondering why Kyle why are there two and
I'm sure many of you already know the
answer there's actually a USB 2.0 hub
right here you can plug in whatever USB
enabled device you your heart desires
whether it be a mouse or a flash drive
or an external hard drive it's kind of a
nifty feature to have actually the USB
cable itself the braided cable is
actually permanently attached to the
keyboard and I would have liked to see
it been able to unattach
because honestly the keyboard that I'm
using now can detach and it's really
nice I've gotten used to just attaching
my keyboard without having to mess
around with the wires at the back of my
system so that's one feature I wish
rosal would have included but not a huge
deal breaker by any means aside from
that take a look at the back back back
back you can see we have four rubber
accents very small rubber feet and just
to prevent your keyboard from slip and
sliding around on your desk when you're
using it and then you have two feet that
pop up just like that and that will
actually elevate your keyboard ever so
slightly so it provides a little bit
more ergonomic feel for your wrists and
your hand
and stuff like that and these are also
rubber accents on the ends aside from
that I don't know if I didn't mention
this in intro I totally overlooked this
this is actually an illuminated keyboard
so each of these keys are individually
backlit with their very own LEDs and
can't really tell here so why don't I
plug in and take a look at it all lit up
all right boys and girls here's the
keyboard plugged in powered up and all
of its LED backlit glory and did want to
also mention that the lock buttons caps
lock scroll lock and unlock are lit up
in green whereas the rest of the keys
light up in blue and I kind of wish that
these lock buttons lit up in red I feel
like that might have matched a little
bit better with the blue but that's
personal preference and honestly I
usually don't have any of these keys
enabled anyway so I don't think it
matters that much just a personal
thought and I'm aside from that this is
a really nice frame here it's it's
actually kind of like a hard plastic but
it doesn't feel cheap at all this
keyboard actually does have some weight
to it and I do like how thin like the
bezel and the frame of this keyboard is
because for people like me I have a
really small desk and a keyboard like
this actually saves me a lot of room for
like my mouse for example over there or
whatever else you know whatever clutter
that I want to put on my desk so I do
like how small this keyboard is in
comparison to other mechanical keyboards
I've seen aside from that this keyboard
does feature six key rollover so I can
actually hold down any six keys on this
keyboard at a time about seven actually
know about six six are there and all of
them will activate no problem so if I'm
like playing Wow for example you know
doing a crap kind of DPS as long as I'm
holding at least six keys or less down
I'm going to be just fine the keyboard
also does feature eight multimedia
shortcut keys up here with your ear F
buttons so this is like your web browser
email fast forward rewind play pause and
volume control down and up or up and
down and mute and these four keys right
here are actually your led control area
keys so if you hold down function press
f9 that's actually your mode button so
you can go through the different modes
this is like your gaming mode got WASD
and your arrow keys and you also have
basically everything except for your 10
key number pad lit up and the last mode
that you can enable is just full-blown
everything and
the key next to that is you're basically
on and off switch so if you're using
this keyboard during the day for example
there's really no need to have your LEDs
on other than it looking kind of cool
but you can turn them off completely
with that button right there
and they're also for levels of
brightness that you can use with this
keyboard so right now it's just as
bright as it is this is the maximum
level of brightness you can go down and
down and down so very nice features
there there's Roseville Roseville logo
to your right and oh yeah the main
feature of this keyboard I want to save
this for last because it is the best
feature cherry MX blue switches all of
these keys even the 10 key number pad
and the F buttons up top feature cherry
MX blue switches they're rather clicky
you can hear that and there some would
say they're a little bit noisy depends
on how fast they're the type where you
are how how much pressure you like to
put down on your keys but it is rather
quickie and it does have a high pitch
sound to it I personally don't mind it
at all some people hate it some people
love it I personally use a Cherry MX
brown switches or dat home and hey I'm
home right now so why don't I pull out
that board and we can compare the sound
between the two
all right so since I have my cherry MX
brown switches in between the different
key press properties of Cherry MX blue
and Cherry MX brown switches so first
taking a look at the RK 9100 here with
the Cherry MX blues just see what
happens when I press down the key all
right you get I click well I also felt a
little bit of resistance on my finger
there felt a little bump and that
basically is the activation point of any
of these keys on with the Cherry MX
blues and I can continue going down
quite a bit further so here it is again
activation point with the click and bump
and I can continue going down so that's
really nice because it activates pretty
much halfway down you don't have to
press it all the way down to make
contact like you do with the older
membrane keyboards and I think that's
one of the benefits of mechanical
keyboards is that you don't have to
apply so much pressure to activate those
keys so it's especially nice if your
gaming or typing for long periods of
time you're not going to get as fatigued
with with mechanical keys because that
early activation point the other thing I
want to mention about Cherry MX blue
switches is that they have a very fast
release time so after you're done
pressing it they snap back into place
very rapidly and that's good because you
can just kind of tap as fast as you can
and it's going to keep up with you it's
gonna reach back at your finger it's
gonna follow your finger pretty much
right behind it the entire time and the
main benefit of that is for for gamers
I'd like to say just because a lot of
gamers have to like press Keys rapidly
and you never want any redundant key
presses or redundant keystrokes when
you're gaming that to be the difference
between life and death so that is one of
the main benefits of Cherry MX blues
that you see very commonly with a lot of
hardcore gamers now I'm gonna take this
opportunity to compare the Cherry MX
blues let the Cherry Max Browns so we
can see some differences here to find
out which keyboard is right for you and
so here with the same control button
here I'm going to press it down hope we
do that again so right there I felt the
bump I felt the bump I feel the
resistance but notice there was no click
it's absolutely silent I'll do it again
just totally silent so that is one main
difference between chair mix blues and
browns that there is no click to
indicate that you've hit the activation
point with Cherry MX browns only the
bump and the other thing the other
difference
is that the release time for cherry MX
browns is not quite as rapid as with
cherry MX blues and you notice it's it
so it feels a little bit more mushy for
lack of a better term than the Cherry MX
blues which feel very snappy and
responsive but that's not necessarily a
bad thing because a lot of people prefer
the Cherry MX browns for typing because
you're not necessarily going to need
that quick response when you're typing
you know 70 words a minute or whatever
but I personally feel like carry mix
Browns are a happy medium between gaming
and typing whereas a cherry MX blue I'm
probably opt for that type of switch if
I were strictly just gaming so there you
have it
Oliver writes me lovely lads that is
gonna wrap it up for this review on this
mechanical gaming keyboard from
Roseville once again this is their
arcane 90 100 in Cherry MX blue switches
also available in Cherry MX brown if
you're into that kind of thing and
closing thoughts and words on this
keyboard I do wish once again that there
was a removable USB plug right here and
I also do not completely agree with the
blue and green color scheme of the LEDs
here but personal preference of course
and aside from that I really do love the
build quality of this thing I think it's
very sturdy very durable and I also love
how small it is like the frame and the
bezel so thinly curved as I've it
especially for a small desk like the one
I'm using right now this is perfect for
me and honestly I this board for a
couple hours I'm considering replacing
my current board with one of these
granted I'd probably get the Cherry MX
brown version of this and they didn't
pay me to say that I swear to God I just
I really do like this board and I have a
new a gift card lying around somewhere
but I would recommend this board if
you're looking for a gaming mechanical
keyboard so that said thank you guys for
watching this review let me know what
you guys think of this board in the
comment section below or if you have it
