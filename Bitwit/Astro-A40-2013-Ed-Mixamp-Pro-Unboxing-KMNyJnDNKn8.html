awesomesauce news today I'm gonna be
doing an unboxing of this product from
astro this is their a 40 gaming headsets
2013 edition they've come out with a 840
in previous years but they've made some
adjustments to this one but it also
comes included with Astros very own mix
amp bro alright take a look at the front
of the box here we can see a nice big
image of the headset itself as well as
the mix AMPRO right here some branding
across in a nice kind of
semi-transparent font up here we can
take a look and see that this is xbox
ps3 and pc compatibl it uses a
three-and-a-half inch jack so that's
gonna work with just about anything that
includes mp3 player or basically
anything anything that uses that Jack
which is a lot aside from that there's
not much on the side of the box here we
kind of just get some stylized
urban design on the back we kind of get
into some more useful information
there's an exploded view of the headset
itself you can see that there's a I
think they're calling these things
speaker tags these little side plates on
the sides of your ear cups those are
removable and you also have a removable
microphone removable auxiliary cable and
this diagram here shows you that you can
actually daisy chain these mix and pros
so if you have land party or something
like that
your friends have a bunch of mix ant
pros you can chain them together use
them simultaneously it's kind of cool
and this kind of just building upon that
idea of the removable speaker tags they
have different designs for for these
speaker tags and if you want you can
swap them out and kind of rock your
favorite brand or logo or just kind of
you know cool design adds to the
customizability of these of these
headsets before I open up the box I just
want to go over these specs here I'm not
gonna go over all of them just the ones
that I feel are important enough to
mention so dynamic and open transducer
principle I've heard mixed things saying
that these are open back or closed back
headphones but I'm gonna test them out
in just a second and see for myself how
much sound they leak
and what the sound signature is the
frequency response is fifteen to twenty
eight thousand Hertz and it's got a
nominal width pians impedance of 50 ohms
so that's pretty good right I see a lot
of consumer headphones at 32 ohms so
this is kind of a nice little boost a
little bit more
power to drive your drivers but it's not
too many ohms it's not too high of an
impedance so that you couldn't use this
like an mp3 player or something like
that so should work just fine I think 50
is a kind of a sweet spot for a gaming
headset the weight is 324 grams it's got
a characteristic SPL of 104 decibels
your coupling is circa mural and it's
got a castle run distance of under 12
parsecs headband pressure of 2.6 and I
don't know what the N stands for
I'm slipping my mind at the moment
distortion of less than 0.1% and the mix
ain't pro also has some specs so it
basically gets its power and charge from
a USB mini-b cable draws about 70
milliwatts or 32 ohms per channel and
it's got a frequency response of 20 to
20,000 Hertz I'm gonna go over all that
other stuff in just a bit so why don't
we open this guy up alright so I'm gonna
remove the box from this cardboard
sleeve II it's um pretty much useless to
us now but it served its purpose well
I'm providing a nice aesthetic look to
the front of the box but here you can
see it still looks pretty stylish even
on the inside so basically how this
works is you pop one side open new
headset first thing you see and on the
other end is your mix ant Pro OOP this
little things got undone but you can
unfold that there you go there's one
more compartment for your set
accessories essentially so here's a
little card saying welcome to the Astro
family thank you for buying Astro siphon
that here's your microphone so it's kind
of difficult to pop out there we go
uh here it's a pretty standard 3.5
millimeter jack on one end so it is
removable of course from your headset so
you can actually use this headset just
you know for an mp3 player for example
or whatever else you need headphones for
but this mic is actually a
unidirectional microphone so that means
it's only gonna be picking up sound from
the direction that it's pointed at so if
it's pointed out your mouth it's in
theory only gonna be picking up your
voice which is nice it's kind of anti or
it's noise cancelling in that regard and
it also does feature kind of a nice
rubber rubbery exterior so it is
flexible so you can actually just bend
it it's kind of like Gumby status it's
kind of nice if you wanted to push it
away from your mouth temporarily you can
do so aside from that why don't we take
a look at the cables there are quite a
lot of them in this bench so first off
you've got your USB charging cable so
that's as I said earlier USB 2.0 2 mini
B USB right there so it's gonna go from
your computer or your game console to
your mix and it's gonna power it that
way you also have a coaxial optical
cable this is three meters of optical
goodness so you can use that with your
console or your PC if your PC has a an
optical apse and you have also got this
xbox live cable right here so if you
wanted to you could plug in this you can
plug in your Xbox 360 controller
to your mixing up and take advantage of
Xbox Live Chat and this is a 3.5 inch
standard auxiliary cable 3.5 inch I'm
sorry 3.5 millimeter on up on both ends
you can actually use a mp3 player and
plug it into your mix amp if you wanted
to actually listen to music from your
iPod or whatever while you're while
you're gaming which is kind of a nice
feature a lot of people like to rage to
their favorite tunes while they're
playing games I know I do and this is
pretty much the that's a this is the
most important cable in the whole batch
this is your a 40 connector cable or
your console cable is what they're
calling it so it's once again three
point five millimeters on both ends
except this is actually a little module
here for muting your microphone so if
you slide it over there you can see the
red is exposed on the side there that
means your microphone is muted and you
slide it back to unmute and lastly you
have a PC splitter so if you're using a
PC with this headset which I know all of
you are you basically have your
microphone and headphone jacks on one
end and on the other end you have a
single 3.5 millimeter female connector
right there and lastly just have a Quick
Start Guide here showing you basically
what cables you need to use for various
configurations whether using a ps3 xbox
or pc there you have it and on that note
why don't we take a look
the mixin Pro and that's it all right so
here's the mix ant Pro and as you can
see it's got the LEDs on so it's all
powered up as I mentioned before it's
using the USB mini-b cable right there
it's actually plugged into my PC right
now but there's a power button up top
you've got a pretty large volume knob up
top as well and the bottom this isn't
the volume knob that well kind of basis
of all you mixer so if you put it right
at the center there at 12 o'clock
it's actually going to give you an even
mix of your game and voice audio and
then from there you can choose if you
want to prefer one or the other you can
just adjust it accordingly the two
buttons right here I'm going to talk
about the right one first is your Dolby
Surround you simply press it and when
the light is on or when the red light
turns on means you've ennoble enabled I
can't talk right now
you've enabled Dolby Surround simply
press it again to disable it on the left
side you have a button here that
actually controls four different EQ
settings so the first one which is
indicated by the LED lights and
depending on which corner it is in will
tell you which setting you're in so in
the top left corner there that's
actually your Pro Mode and Pro Mode
essentially accentuates certain sounds
in your games so let's see your plan FPS
for example you're probably gonna hear
an amplification in gunshots or
footsteps or grenades and things of that
nature it's essentially gonna give you
an edge when you're playing games the
next EQ setting is what does that one oh
it's core I think it's core so core is
essentially it's almost not an EQ
setting at all it's just neutral
everything's turned off it's basically
for when you want to listen to music or
movies or sound the way it's meant to be
heard so from that you have media your
media setting and that's it is also for
music and movies except it actually
accentuates the bass quite a bit so if
you're watching an action movie for
example if you're listening to some
dubstep something very bass heavy that's
that drives with a lot of low end
frequencies you're gonna want to put
that on to get the most out of your
music and movies and lastly you have
sporting mode which is essentially going
to create a stadium like feel and sound
for whatever you might be listening to
so if you're watching sports of course
you want to make it seem like you're
there or you're listening to music and
you want it to seem more like
like you're at a concert as opposed to
listening to a concert in your head you
can use that right there so from that
we've got some ports on the bottom so
these two on the sides they are
identical and they both serve the same
purpose which is daisy chaining these
guys together as I mentioned earlier and
then this port right here it's just your
standard headphone jack so you're gonna
wrap your 3.5 millimeter cable from this
port to your headset and right there is
your Xbox Live Chat port taking a look
at the ports on the other side we have
your mini B USB port which is currently
in use of course you have a stream ports
and this is actually a nifty feature
what it does it takes all of your audio
so your ingame audio your voice audio
any audio from windows 7 and it
condenses it down into one stream and
from there you can actually route this
to a capture card if you want to record
gameplay and you want all the audio
recorded at the same time or you can
route it to your PC if you're doing some
live streaming for example so it's
really good for kind of let's players
and youtubers out there who who are big
gamers and like to either record or
stream their gameplay so from that
you've got an mp3 port right there and
that essentially as I mentioned earlier
you can write up your mp3 player to this
thing and listen to music while you game
just to pump you up a little bit and
lastly you have your optical input right
there alright so here are the headphones
and I forgot to mention earlier that
they do come in a black model and a
white model as you can see this is
definitely the white model but it also
has many black accents on it so it's
kind of a two-tone kind of a nice little
color scheme go in there very neutral
should match with most things around you
if you care about aesthetics but as far
as the overall build quality of these
things everything white that you can see
is plastic and pretty much everything
that's black is plastic as well with the
exception of the ear cup pads that's
actually a nice soft felt material as
well as the padding underneath the
headband and even on the top this is not
plastic it's also kind of got a tougher
felt feel to it and the side rails right
here so where you can adjust the size of
your your headband right here that black
bar is actually made
metal as well but aside from that the
rest is plastic and a lot of you might
say well that's a terrible thing it's
probably really crappy then but that's
not necessarily true
I think it being plastic is has allowed
it to be extremely lightweight much
lighter than most gaming headsets I've
seen so in theory you shouldn't feel it
as much on your head and I know these
ear cups are very comfortable I've
tested them out and the fact that
there's very little weight on your head
means that you can probably stand them
for a little bit longer than you would a
really heavy set of headphones aside
from that you can take a look on the
sides here there are the two what are
they called speaker tags speaker tags
and they're very easily removable they
pop off just like that
there's actually four little magnets on
the corners that connective four little
magnets right there so it's a magnetized
design which I really like look there's
another Astra logo you just can't escape
the ESCO branding if you pop this off
there's probably another Astra logo
underneath that but I think it's a
really smart design just really clicks
on quite easily it's easy to swap them
out and on this type going back to this
side you actually have your port there
for your microphone so it just snaps
into place just like so and it's really
nice actually you can lift it up like
that and I hit it with them like you
there's like a mic that you lift up on a
headset and it just instantly droops
back down but this one's nice you can
orient it any way you want and it's it's
gonna stay put for the most part alright
guys so as I promised earlier in this
video I was gonna let you know whether
or not these headphones were open back
door close back and right now I have my
PC volume set to 50% I am using an Asus
Ozona essence STX sound card in my rig
so there's a little bit of amplification
going on there but essentially you can
hear quite a bit there's quite a bit of
sound leakage from these from this
headset right now but keep in mind a lot
of that sound is coming out from the ear
cups directly so I'm gonna put the
headset on for a little while so you can
hear how much sound is actually leaking
out the sides of the headset but I think
even before I do that I think it's
pretty safe to say that these are
open-back headphones or this is an
open-back headset so I'm gonna put them
on anyway and guys
give a listen oh by the way the
microphone is about an arm's length away
from me here we go
alright guys that is gonna wrap it up
for this video once again this has been
an unboxing of the Astro a40 gaming
headsets and the mix AMPRO I'm Kyle with
awesomesauce news guys if you guys
