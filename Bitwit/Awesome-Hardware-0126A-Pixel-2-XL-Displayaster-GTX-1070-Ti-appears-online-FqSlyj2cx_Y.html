welcome back to awesome hardware this is
episode 126 I'm starting to lose camp
let's say you know we're getting high up
there that's why I told you more and
more we should catch the numbers at what
some point mmm no more no goodness but
then how will everyone anyone be like
I'll remember episode give that one
episode when they won't say that but
they'll say remember when they used to
have numbers on the episodes that's what
I mean people could say I've been
watching since they used to number of
the episodes oh my gosh back with back
when they still had season yeah that's
an implant like full bodied hair what if
we just switching over to the alphabet
we'll just start them saying are you
wearing a B where do you have a and B in
each one I'm have a side a and side B
well then we'll start doing side one
inside - we'll just flip it you know
okay so just as long as people are
confused exactly I mean that's our goal
all the time the whole point I want you
to feel what I'm feeling so guys this is
a tech news show more or less that Paul
and I do every single Tuesday at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time right here on
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware we also
stream the show simultaneously to our
respective YouTube channels we break the
show up there into two halves
today's show is gonna be airing on my
channel first and then after about an
hour or so we're gonna switch it over to
Paul's hardware and that's how it goes
we like to have an adult beverage or two
while we do the show drink beer make us
some time cuz sometimes and and the
drinking actually educator Pecha weights
the the cussing so be warned if you are
of sensitive hearing just getting warmed
up though getting warmed up
Paul it is fall except it's 103 degrees
it's getting cold it up ice want to
point out
nothing's warming it's really hot it is
yet is why the air conditioners on yes
so if you hear like a faint buzzing or
like humming in the background that's
the AC no we will not turn it off
because screw you we are hot only gonna
get hotter as we drink more beer and
you're gonna get hotter - mmm
see what you did there um let's see we
sell stuff don't we yeah I mean all that
as soon as I'm finished pouring my beer
yes she is what a bleaching is a mugging
over fest from Sam Adams I believe yes
Sam Adams Oktoberfest whoo cheers to you
guys thanks for watching they make a
solid October thanks for being here
mm-hmm stories stories so my story is
bit without tech slash store we have a
couple new designs that are fantabulous
as courtesy of some of our contestants
in the t-shirt design contest we had
going on there is energy be everything
shirt it is phenomenal guys go to the
site and look at it up close
beware of bottle necks one of my
personal favorite classic and also be
the classic sword fight from Brian
monoxide yep always a winner and guys if
you pick up any of the awesome hardware
branded t-shirts from either of our
stores we pretty much split the money so
you have to like be conflicted
internally as to who you buy it from we
consider briefly donating it to charity
yeah always yeah always always consider
consider being the key we do we do have
a charity event it's in the planning
phases right now yeah we did one last
year yeah this one's we're gonna try to
make a little bit more straightforward
but it will involve a live stream and
stuff like that and a build more details
to come but yeah we got some bills as
well and of course all for charity yeah
so yeah well we'll let you guys know as
we get stuff figured out see we're kind
generous people give us more money yeah
um why we got net Pulsar we're done what
do you got Paul I also have the new
awesome marker shirts I have just
recently added these awesome stainless
steel bottle openers which I actually
have here but not yeah I got everything
but that other stuff too hoodies oh yeah
he's another stuff I want to go get my
bottle opener oh yes yes I have to every
time Paul mentions his new bottle opener
I have to remind all of you that I've
had the same GeForce NVIDIA GeForce 1
that's exactly the same just printing
with IDIA stuff that I got as a piece of
swag and I can attest to its quality the
build qualities top-notch price
performance it'll last you a lifetime
not only that if you're into filming at
all it makes a great tool for for
screwing on the hot plate onto your
camera any like three and a quarter inch
little threads or anything like that it
is a fantastic multi-tool and everyone
should go buy 30 of them more beers
although we're fine for now but we need
we need live demos on how the bottle
appears right we'll need to use here's
about yep it's beautiful and still got
its very nice edging as well yeah it's
one pours on a printer or printing or
whatever that's a laser etched laser
etched in changing Ont will wear off the
laser etching is forever will slowly
scrape off no it will stay there forever
you can use it to cut people yes hey
thanks for supporting us in buying stuff
on our stories well yell Johnson at you
at the end of the show and also if you
guys happen to be donating in super chat
with the YouTube we will be reading all
of those messages attached to those
donations at the end of each half of the
show so sandal and baby alright our
first segment on my half episode 126 is
ask the audience
we don't have lower thirds for
everything but are you talking about
Kyle Oh see now this excuses us being
five ten minutes late because you are so
prepared
way more than I look aside how's the
compressor working since Kyle just
tested that for you ah I'm still I've
still got it set to about four I can
test it out all day every day oh yeah
yeah yeah
asking the audience we're gonna ask you
questions you guys gonna answer we're
gonna guess what your answers yeah so
there's gonna be a series of three
questions that we'll be asking you guys
in chat you'll have to answer a little
straw poll fairly harmless and then
Paula and I have to guess what your
guys's answers are and the one who's
closest or the one who's furthest away
from guessing the right answer has to
take a large swig of their beer
pretty straightforward oh yeah helps us
get more acquainted with you guys and
it's fairly interactive so it should be
pretty fun our first question is I just
sort of randomly thought of these at the
beginning of the day what percentage of
our
viewers our existing viewers currently
in chat what percentage of them have
liquid cooling in their rig right now so
we have to kind of determine we have to
give a percentage value and typically in
sections Pat's ass this is any kind of
liquid cooling rights pretty broad I
mean because I mean I mean there's so
many there's only so many people I
shouldn't say there's only so many
things you can cool but here's the thing
you're not gonna like liquid cool your
RAM but not your CPU so I mean you know
we're talking a huge EP for the most
part that wasn't split in those hairs oh
okay I'm talking like I just I have like
an icicle I have an iced tea and I just
set it on top of my case my liquid
cooling now do you see the last things
you see the last time in their beer so
we can't necessarily using alternative
means we can't necessarily guess one of
those it's either a sort of percentage
thing but yes I understand so I'm
thinking more of the traditional liquid
cooling so a product that you would buy
or something you would do yourself that
would cool your components in some way
with liquid and obviously that would
include all in one course it would
include that yes absolutely let's do use
liquid yes they do
the visibles of five you have you can
guess any any range of percentage of how
likely you think it is our viewers
usually cook boy I feel like Oh sobs
last time we did this as really I was
kind of off but it's kind of its kind of
weird right you have this assumption in
your head and then sometimes your
competitors also it's also like you know
our viewers versus the market as a whole
you know there may be you know well yeah
there might be more I still I still feel
like it's gonna be less than fifty
percent okay especially with the third
option added in there true so I want to
say I gotta do a multiple of five you
said ah you know what
oh actually it wasn't it has to be at
least five away so when I go after you
it has to be at least 5% away from yours
oh so if you say like seventy I can't
say 71% like that's kind of a car I see
yes that was the rule
so any number you want really 37% you
know I was thinking like thirty to forty
actually as I was driving on the way
over here I was thinking about that 37%
were you thinking that I would get it
absolutely dead on correct maybe what's
coming at you you might you seem fairly
confident it's kind of freaking me out
but I think I am more confident in my
guess and I'm gonna say yes I'm gonna
say 1e9 twenty six twenty six percent
twenty six percent yeah I'm gonna say
twenty six percent as a rule is it has
to be at least 5 percent oh yes okay
twenty six percent says Kyle yeah and
before we look at the results just to
give the people who are slow on the
uptake more chance to vote we're gonna
actually reveal the next question yes
absolutely so I can post this you guys
can go ahead and start voting on this
one as well yep all your RGB Hardware
malfunctions causing it to get stuck on
one color for all of eternity which
color do you hope for yep and there's
there's some additional rules for us
here Kyle yeah so you and I cannot
choose white that's kind of the cheap
and then also we can't choose off which
is an option for you guys I mean the
answer honestly if it's often choose off
but we have to kind of and for this it's
not a percentage thing we just have to
guess which color okay so you'd be like
green blue who gets the most besides
often wait which I think are probably
gonna be yeah the most yes all right so
before we do that though
pardon me and everyone please feel free
to start voting on that one mm-hmm does
your PC feature any kind of liquid
cooling what I don't forget what I said
that's 37 and I said 26 26 all right
let's see what see what we got here
results Wow
45 oh my gosh
Stachel oh my we don't really know you
guys are oh if this is this is accurate
which I feel which obviously has to be
our viewers are very honest they would
never lie to us and straw polls are you
know it's a it's a secret covenant
really yes but all right forty five
percent that's alright I'm pretty
surprised that almost half of you have
liquid cooling in your systems I did
feel like I was low-balling I felt like
I was a little balling with 37 I was
like all right if I'm gonna choose yeah
obviously it's 45 but you know I want to
give Kyle the impression that I know
exactly what it is yeah probably a
little bit less than that but I still
win oh yes you drink your beer drink my
damn beer haha i watch you as you
suffered oh darn this delicious
Oktoberfest punishment sample that you
people usually pay for ha ha ha ha ha
yes feel it as it's refreshing and
delicious whoo that was a big goal yep
all right no gargle it though that's oh
I can really definitely go because they
get although that's how you aerate it
hey let's take that singular a look at
our next a next option okay again all
right so what color I mean who gets to
choose first here too by the way um well
I feel like you went first last time so
I couldn't go first I'll go first all
right so now when I was writing the
survey when I was filling out the survey
I kind of just put down whatever colors
I I was thinking of first so obviously
red blue green or the top and I feel
like those are surprisingly popular I'm
surprised you did red blue green not red
green blue yeah RGB I'm just trying to
you know keep you on your toes
really it don't like you use one of
those little adapter things to switch
two of them yes
but I'm gonna go with
I'm gonna go with blue blue blue is my
guess I feel like blue is pretty
universally awesome
and it has longevity I feel like no you
I mean I'm here I don't think you need
to back up the call of blue and collar
you you know yeah look around it's
probably like for me it was gonna be red
or blue and whatever one you chose I was
gonna choose the other so I'm going to
choose good all right I'm not green
because what why is why do you think red
blue and not green just I feel like
there's more more components yeah more
there's more likelihood of people
actually having a system that they
already have with the color commentary I
guess it's just these other ones they're
just not quite as common I mean trust me
if teal takes the lead here I want to be
stowed I mean oh yeah well both drink
for teal yep and I'm sure like
manufacturers watching this right now
we're gonna start just making teal
components oh yeah left or right there's
a huge high demand for the first like
see all available bare-bones computer
that I built from Fry's when I was like
15 or 16 you were warns that this teal
it was like a beige box and this teal
like flat those style Shepherds like the
USB one ports and the floppy and they're
like yeah the the 4x cd-rom drives it
was a nice hey um that so we've made our
choices but again let's jump forward
here and let people start getting their
vote on for the next one we have one
more question
yep this aspect is obviously the most
importance are you wearing pants right
now yes this is a real time question you
have to as soon as you read this and you
hear this you have to look at you look
down and ask yourself am i wearing pants
and then that answer honestly if you're
a pants you're not a lot what's here
doing
he's like here I was inspecting I don't
know what he's that here go lie down in
your bed you look like you're up to no
good here oh he usually doesn't go or
lie down and now he's been way too quiet
good we're always quiet very quiet yeah
he's like he's like it's like a cat
except he's a big dog okay
cat dog and you can't teach your hands
up like if you took your pants off no
after you saw this what does it attract
pants thing okay you were in the middle
of taking your pants off when we brought
this question up then you can continue
this yes absolutely but I think it also
we should also I think I think shorts
should be included here if you're
wearing pants or shorts right cuz I'm
just kind of asking are you wearing you
just you just they're rich what sister
wrench no because because really it's
like are they wearing look like like
underwear anywhere not only 50% of
people who are gonna vote have voted
already and suddenly you're like sure
it's count as pants and you're like what
I'm like what are you out of your
 mind right I thought it I
thought it was like pants no but it's
implied if you ask me this right now are
you wearing pants I would say no because
I am wearing shorts right but see my
initial response to that would be I'd be
horrified or slightly aroused because I
would imagine that you were just in your
boxers or fully nude from the waist down
which I have confirmed my intent would
be to create sort of a mental image or
whatever all I'm saying is I'm being
honest okay and sure it's not equal
pants to me okay feel like that I'm
adding that later on okay
I mean if it was disclosed at the very
beginning you're right you're wrong and
maybe then I feel like there'd be a lot
of people who have already submitted
their votes okay I'm good faith all
right pants are pants sure you're right
okay we'll take it from a literal
standpoint um so I'll let you go first
this time Paul you get to argue or at
least you we got that we got to go back
or Sonny we still haven't figured out it
all right are usually very about the RGV
okay everyone say we we got so this is a
tech news show I promise
it's Kevin coming real soon all right so
you said red
the new tech stuff yes way more
interesting thank you
you said blue I said red yes let's see
what people say oh my gosh even beating
white and off no wait that this is this
is hacks this is hat by the way you just
said the word beating and the word off
in the same sentence it beeped oh I
can't believe it beats off I wouldn't
expect it to be I mean blue bead off red
bead ha ha everything beats off at some
point right I'm surprised but I'm
actually surprised I think it's because
there's blue LEDs in the back diamond
liminal messaging is what it is but
really I'm really surprised actually
most of these 70 - if any of our regular
videos were to get de Montes possum
hardware is that what I would expect but
apparently our various photo editing are
very effective um pre-show warnings have
been yes the hands very effective yeah
yeah I'm taken seriously all right sorry
okay cool something you you owe the
audience I do I do
uh cheers cheers Cheers I beat off Paul
my goodness have you done yep
yeah just that was a so much so much
beating off going on right now all right
now we're down to our final question
which is are you wearing pants right now
this one has truly separates the people
working so so there's two ways we can do
this we can do it like percentage-wise
like we did the first question or we
could just say a simple yes or no and
whoever's right on that kind of a 50/50
shot wait as simply yes or no yeah or
like you know most people are wearing
pants or most people are not ants or
bats that we can pass fail it we can
pass Kayla yeah
all right let's do that let's do that
okay and you said I get to choose yeah
I'm gonna say I'm gonna say pants off
okay no pants you're betting that most
people have no pants on pants what are
those that's what I'm going with over
horse
all right first I was gonna be like know
our viewers are respectable but then I
realize you know a lot of people take
him back relaxingg right now yep it's
true and if you want to relax and do it
right yeah so there you go that's where
I'm at there all right well then you
know where I stand
let's go ahead and see cows the cows got
the pants on he wears the pants in this
moment people are wearing these are more
civilized than I ever imagined that is
that's a pretty significant margin to
them but you never know if I had removed
a rude sandstorm you know where would
those votes have gone who knows who
knows oh I was level the playing field I
guess I should also have taken into
account that we're still fairly early in
the show right now that's true headed
home person first-half segment one by
the end of the show I'm guessing more
pants will come off yeah it's a thing
that happens progressively okay well
guys if you're those viewers who are
watching this as a reupload feel free to
take this survey I'll dump it into the
description that that man and say take
your pants off frame or or to order that
but in any rate everyone watching this
video and listening to our boys take
your pants off should take your pants
off right now you know if you're if it
if it's an appropriate environment and
you're not in the mall Wow
that'd be so weird though there's such a
weird things some far far away a place
for me everyone's just taking their
pants you'd be arrested right now
because we told them that their pants up
okay I lost nice alright yeah that's
that's a night shyamalan next movie
called like it's like the happening but
instead of people dying everyone's just
taking their pants off and no one knows
what random moments
and it turns out the like goes real and
this is they were all watching our life
yeah
alright guys that's that's ask the
audience I feel like I probably be
better than a lot of the other M night
Shyamalan perfect pitch that to your to
your local agents
Mark Wahlberg he's all confused and
afraid about why people get up you know
the reason is because because the
pantsing is actually turns out to be the
prequel to the fact oh yeah he's got to
come before B okay
quite literally all right that would be
a good review yeah hey literally all
right um
let's move on to pimp my PC budget dish
this is the budgeted dish so I'm really
hyper stood on Twitter earlier today
asking you guys to send me some pictures
of your of your systems that were about
more or less $750 and under whether or
not you know that that's actually
exactly how these are valued that
remains debatable but I kind of like
just to commander at the ones we
selected for today and I figured yeah
you know it's possible on these a lot of
you guys have been buying these parts
used which significantly can cut down
the costs so i factored that into into
into all this and we've got some pretty
you get some pretty humble systems for
today but also rigs that have that
potential so Paul and I are gonna try so
much potential really try to help you
guys out here
first off with Joshua Joshua Joshua
Harris with the core i5 2500 K 4.0
gigahertz and ASUS Maximus motherboard
cryo at age seven gigabyte 700 750 Ti
that's a g-force card of course and it
looks like you got eight gigs of memory
in there with a 500 gig hard drive cost
him about 500 bucks what should he
upgrade so before we get into the
upgrades if any let's talk about just
what's going on here first thing that
stands out to you Paul
first thing that stands out to me just
aesthetically or I mean yeah I mean yeah
okay
your your rear exhaust fan is facing the
wrong direction yes right here yeah that
is pulling air and it is conflicting
with the directional air flow from your
Creek right h7 so definitely flipping
that would be item number 1 on our list
um
beyond that aesthetically I mean you got
a bit of loose cables going around the
cabling itself is actually pretty pretty
on point as far as like it's all black
and red yeah the color scheme is looking
pretty good
definitely um look how it's looking good
you could you know if you were gonna get
in there and do some aesthetic upgrades
and so it's flip the fan and what else
whatever not you might you might remove
your label from your power supply that
could clean things up a little bit yeah
just take more advantage of the space
behind your motherboard tray and and get
smart cables back there and then as far
as what should you upgrade definitely is
gonna be your core components I mean
your yeah you got a 2500 K I mean unless
you want up want to overclock that more
which you probably be able you should be
able to afford suited for for with that
like like just about looking at a 2500 K
yeah but especially with the Maximus
motherboard in a nice acquiring a seven
but the graphics card honestly yeah
graphics card 2500 cases all still
thriving it's still pumping them out
it's starting it's starting to what
didn't uh dimitri from hardware connects
do a video on the 2600 k recently yeah
yeah more CPU intensive ones are gonna
suffer with that particular chip but
750ti oh no i wonder how much faster a
1080i is or 1050 TI sorry 1050 TI over
750 ti there might be a nice boost yeah
I mean I think you're dry you could
probably do a quick graphics card
upgrade and get yourself a little bit
more performance there generation that
would be a quick over a quick upgrade
you know going to something like class
at 10:50 or 1050 TI
beyond that your core components is
probably what you want - yes whop out so
you another boy looking at it
pretty pretty good system overhaul there
yeah but yeah hang on to that cooler h7
is a good bit cooler your power supplies
fine as long as you're not going with a
higher-end graphics card and other than
that your components are pretty well
color matched I guess yeah so good job
yeah Joshua thank you very much for
sending that in next up we've got Carlos
MJ this is his system and looks like we
have specs here he gave us a PC part
picker list let's quickly look at that
so we got a rise in 5 1400 nice and a B
350 M motherboard from asrock 8 gigs of
Corsair Vengeance lpx just a single
stick this also proves that he's within
your price your price range yes
absolutely that's very true GTX 1052
good card from PNY we have a DIY PC ATX
mini tower case and six hundred power
supply and some purple fans there's
actually purple yep purple for a miracle
course here all right I like the purple
first off points for that and that's a
nice color accent yeah yeah that's great
and for the most part things are looking
color neutral here elsewhere
apart from me the power supply sticker
the SSD sticker out of 82 the drive but
everything looks pretty good the one
thing that sticks out to me is this
probably an HD audio cable that kind of
just is running across your motherboard
this one maybe that's not HD audio
that's actually not HD audio that's that
front panel no front panels are right
here this is HD audio or it's possibly
there's no ribbon cable no I think
you're right it might be HD audio yeah
that is totally worth just ditching
completely yeah if you never plug in
their right front panel audio is often
not the best way to plug in any way you
often get better but yeah you get a
better better sent from the we clean up
the system overall but I feel like apart
from that you're looking pretty good
it's pretty darn clean here
I want to say it like I appreciate the
leaving the plastic on the plexi well
this build is in progress but it seems
like your build is complete just peel
that plastic off yeah that looks
terrible
don't be like the people who lie just
laminate their couches like Gilly nice
couches yeah oh so unlike a if I want to
leave the plastic on so that so the the
pleasure that was like well it's gonna
look like crap yeah you're gonna enjoy
little takeout got it you got it enjoy
it take out that plastic yeah nice nice
little budget bill yeah I like it and
DIY PC I guess I guess yeah and not I
don't hate everything DIY PC has ever
made
no they have some cases they're
perfectly fine I had a bad introduction
to DIY PC while we were doing I was
forced to make videos on there and I
really really just bare budget super
super like it was during the first
mining craze and had these really awful
no test bed type yes they remain their
remaining cases but they were just like
some pieces of Plexiglas or Abul yeah
and like the fact they were charging
people money for it as like people who
are mining right now using egg crates
really you know like put it on blocks or
plastic whatever they can get like no
one wants to pay money yeah for this
garbage crap and I can yeah anyway sorry
um yep holes ran got off on it FX 8350
build with the DX 787 atti indeed this
is from Andrew Andrews means we bartered
for all the hardware I like that I know
this is some scrapyard Wars right
here at first I first when I saw that
cooler on that card I was like there's
no way $750
and it'll make sense now so nati is a
bit old now as Xigmatek case no the oh
the cooler the cooler yeah I think
you're right I think Dark Knight yes
because it was one of the older coolers
that actually had a black heatsink yeah
it's great
yeah I think you're right honestly it
looks pretty good look at your cable
management's like solid very solid very
good on the cable management ketchup and
mustard of course coming from the power
supply isn't always the best so maybe
take a look at some some extensions but
I think there's some other things that
you need to fix first
for example the CPU is red it's a dark
night Xigmatek yeah good call good i
Paul the FX 8350 was a great chip in its
day but it is quite dated now if you
look at just sort of the performance
gains that you get with a rise in CPU
even on the you know the risin three
very ready homes that holds back some
GPU is pretty hardcore definitely so if
you kind of wanted to scale everything
equally I would start with the CPU and
motherboard and get some ddr4 in there
and then you can maybe upgrade your
graphics card if you feel the need to
everything else looks great though you
know if you want to get fancy with the
aesthetics then you can get some
extensions and stuff but I think you
know core components are definitely more
important obviously but other than that
very nice cable management and a very
clean system
thank you some Andrew thank you next up
we've got mean high Rovin or / oven
Nechayev and high in a row of in higher
she's the piper secondhand at old mmm
comes to 600 pounds a dual xeon x5 6660
r9 280 hyper 212 2 terabyte hard drive
and 16 gigs of ram um a hyper 212 what
that's not a hyper 212 it doesn't look
like a hyper 212 to me not at all
perhaps that's all
cooler maybe some interesting detail
shots he has here
why sure it's like here's all my cables
and submit the desktop here's how to
shovel my system is yeah I like this
little computing corner that you have I
would say something to get the case off
the ground system off the ground I was
obviously always one of my complaints
there also why do you have no no memory
in your system no you have a sink you
know there's two there's two sticks of
them why why I have a motherboard a
little slot so my me I mean again if you
bargain for all this stuff or a second
hand that was just what you could find
for your price range then it makes sense
but you know oh there's a hyper 212 it's
up there I was looking at that guy oh my
god a dual socket obviously I I cannot
believe we use both miss yeah I missed
that okay so maybe this was an old
server or something like that yeah that
you know you picked up second hand as
you mentioned single stick of memory for
each it just feels wrong it just feels
wrong to see a board like that with that
many DIMM slots is only having one or
two of them populate it but you know you
do what you can right it does feel like
it's a lot of air and a lot of system
for the price he paid yeah please
speaking yeah definitely school so 16
gigs of RAM so it must be to eight gig
sticks that he's gay right very
interesting so I would say start with
cable management here's all this all
this prices for at the very least able
it'll clean the clean up the look of the
system and it looks like you're in a
define a defined case which has plenty
of cable management room in the back
behind the motherboard tray so tri stash
on that all the way unless of course you
know what this is actually sort of
modified because he's got a really wide
motherboard in this case and there's no
grommets that are in he's completely
covering the grommet area that's why his
cable management such exactly right so I
would say get a case that actually fits
your board if you if you're planning
to use this board long term and they
CPUs long term then upgrade to a better
case that supports that form factor you
should be able to get a big tower case
yeah that'll solve a lot of your
problems I think just in terms of
tidiness and you know read fan on the
back I mean aesthetically speaking if we
were going to that all right this is my
job it's like I barely I get barely even
exerted any force or effort it really
sells itself it's almost like it opens
the bottle for you one paul included
with every purchase as paul will
personally open the bottle for you using
the opener you just purchased all right
really
yeah yeah yeah yes just say yes just say
us nothing nothing we say well we're
doing a live stream is legally binding
of course no all right yeah get a new
case and Brett looks a little cramped in
there and all right moving on moving on
to dark shadow tech dark shadow tech
this is our final entry forth today yeah
r5 1600 lay an MSI be 350 M gaming Pro
Corsair 29 33 megahertz speed memory at
GTX 960 4 gig cooling masters Silencio
case kingston v300 hundred and
twenty-eight gig SSD the WD blue one
terabyte us one terabyte but excuse me
this is this is this is over budget this
is over $750 yeah I was like that too
I was thinking that too and that you
still chose it because why because
perhaps he got a good deal on maybe he
killed someone
I don't know a gtx 960 though even
though all their computer no I think the
most most expensive thing here is the
motherboard and CPU that's I'm in that
much
everything else can be bought used for
pretty darn cheap maybe he killed
someone and use that money to build this
computer I don't think that's what this
person that's like an offset he's using
that to offset the cost then we we
should really consider who we're
catering catering this shows might this
might change killer really watching our
show I do monthly builds and stuff and
be like here's an awesome two hundred
dollar computer build first find someone
7900 x3 builds oh so cable management is
really quite bad here yeah we just you
got a big big mess cables down there and
no excuses silencio has summer I've
built in the Silesia you had it's got if
I was afraid for a second that's the
cilenti yeah yeah it's got a little bit
of space I feel like or it could be
bundled up or something there's there's
just there's some stuff that can be done
about the messy cables going on down
there in the front they look a lot nicer
that's a very budget EVGA power supply
which you know there's given you the
catch of investor cables thing he always
tend to complain about
right so that could look a little bit
nicer and yeah man it was a while ago
that I built in the silencio I feel like
like you got your eight pin or four pin
EPS or ATX connector going up there like
I feel like you should be able to route
that behind the motherboard tray honest
yeah right it looks like it's going
under the GPU I would have Creed the
ground guard because the Rison five
sixteen hundred can actually handle
quite a bit of horsepower your gtx 960
seems a bit slow for that cpu does have
more memory than the GTX 970 though
because it's yes right right okay wow
that just seems like so long ago I had
to like this is I stopped becoming a
throwback yes it is that I thought that
would never go out of style back in the
day and the 900 series good lord times
flying by but yes I agree with
everything Paul said and you should do
everything that he suggested Thank You
dark shadow tech and everybody else for
submitting your system thank you yes get
my PC if you didn't happen to get
selected today we will be doing this
episode or this segment many times again
in the future so don't be too
discouraged now we have some sponsors
sponsor spot sponsor spots it is yet
again the folks over at deep cool I'll
get the beer bottles out of the way so
two seconds we have the captain 240 x OG
b I will start it you will finish it sir
they have two different flavors one is
in black the other in white yes y know
you can you can choose either one based
you know based on your ratios never your
preferences yes so we've got the white
one here which is my personal choice I
would I would get the white one because
white components white components I
think white a iOS are hard to come by if
you're looking for a white a oh yeah
often you have yes to paint yourself or
something like that right it's all
stupid and deep cool has done a pretty
good job painting this I wanna say I
I've been looking at this cooler for the
last few weeks and I haven't found like
any glaring imperfections but the paint
job looks pretty clean all around
perfect the block is also here whites
you've got sort of a I don't know
reactor looking thing at the front which
lights up RGB and you can customize that
of course within within the software's I
really like the fact that they have
white fans as well I feel like even some
of the white a iOS that I've seen in the
past will ship with like a white
radiator and even a water block within
the fan
we'll be black and then you know you
have to freaking spray-paint um if you
actually want a cohesive look stupid
that's dumb rude it's a waste of paint
you're killing the environment people
something like that nose is a wild leap
it was a wild leap I like it I like it
yep
so these cool cares deep cool really
cares about you and the earth and
they've got these nice black sleep
cables on the fans which are fantastic
pun intended and then some custom
looking fan blades that theoretically
we're supposed to aid in airflow and
perhaps acoustics there we go
what well you've been talking a long
time I've immunity and that concludes
our sponsor spy let's move on to the
next thing Paul yes it's not centered I
want to sense if you guys are at all
curious or interested in checking apps
or finding out more about these tours I
put a link in my video description if
you're watching me on the youtubes damn
go for it I should also mention that
they included an LED and RGB LED strip
as well as a little controller unit and
the controller use by useful and a
control unit which I might add
I believe the control unit is just
compatible with yeah with with any any
old 5050 RGB cable or strip which is
pretty sweet
pretty sweet yes we also have the the
fully black one the blackout version
which we'll be unboxing on Paul pack so
stay tuned way different way different
can you even I centered it all right
there are some mounting tools I believe
it's a yeah it is a m4 compatible of
course we've got LGA 20 66 and 1151
it is it is RGB since RGB LEDs yes you
know taking over yeah so here's that
little control unit this is how it
lights up just to shake it there's
lights you know big thank you to deep
cool for sponsoring I got some hardware
just need let's move on to tech news
really quick little update here there's
been a massive crush a massive price
drop ooh
words are strange losses the loss of
Chris a massive loss of press massive
Chris droop on the am do throg dropper
[Laughter]
something's drooping I must test it you
can still talk by the time I get to my
half I know right so this is a from WCC
of tech notifying us that there's been a
pretty heavy sale on the 1950 X so it
was 100 bucks off on Newegg and now it's
hundred twenty backs off oh yeah beside
yes it's actually the last time I
checked it was 120 bucks off both
websites of the same man so yeah they
definitely matched it to stay
competitive once this once the news got
out so now you can buy a friggin 1950 X
for under $900 which is incredibly
competitive when you consider how much
Intel is charging for their higher core
counts guy like extra chips super sweet
yeah super super sweet so if anyone's
interested be sure to use the like why
would you buy a 1920 X when you can
write 80 Alex more at that point it's
closing the gap significantly Weiss the
course and not twice but four more yeah
four more cores in eight more threads
freaking canvas so I've actually put in
a affiliate link in my description so
you can all buy it with my link and that
way I get lots of money and everyone's
happy especially me because I have so
much money
cool that's all I want to say about
story give me money hackers are
threatening to release
cosmetic-surgery pics of celebrities and
Royals in the UK what have you heard
about this this is from
also from WCCO Tenakee they have Royals
in the UK there are Royals the kings and
queens I know it's crazy I've never
heard anything like it the dark overlord
which is a hacking group that's kind of
known for targeting high-profile celebs
have a link here should I click it this
whole website is hacked click nothing
and we're already screwed from being on
it they've stolen sensitive photos from
a celebrity plastic surgery clinic in
London this includes members of the
royal family and just general
celebrities who are famous and
super-rich and stuff the photos include
in-progress genitalia and breast
enhancement leonian frog in in progress
in progress will pre and post-op and
everything in between
apparently actually the the dark
overlord like their building of vagina
and they're in the middle of it or
something building on the middie
building on to a vagina or you know
tearing there demoing a penis or
constructing a schlong they might be
they mean it's a plastic surgery you can
strap the dildo to anything these days
you know not gonna have an expert on the
matter and here's laying down a method
okay um but this is this is intense
stuff so actually The Daily Beast was in
contact with these dudes the dark
Overlord hacking group and they said
that I quote we have terabytes of this
 the hackers told The Daily Beast
databases names everything the daily B's
confirm that the photos that they were
sent by the dark overlord were in fact
proof that they had some juicy stuff
including graphic images of pre and
post-op celebrities and royal members of
the royal family which is quite
interesting they are demanding that
their demands are met so we demand that
our demands be heard yes
there's no specification as to how much
third like what ransom amount they're
asking for or what kind of demands I
actually want but there
of course to leak these images either to
the public or to you know this is gonna
be the the families happening
the fappening - Oh wasn't there already
- oh I was just I'm not sure that's
happening three listen to us acting like
we don't know how many fastenings have
been um no I don't know I think I think
it's pretty much the same sort of
but at the same time I'm sure there are
people in there that I mean when he said
the genitalia I probably wouldn't want
to I don't think that that qualifies for
fappening 3 in my book but that's that's
besides the point that's besides the
point ladies and gentlemen it's just
more of a challenge really yeah you know
it's all it's all about perspective
folks dedication see this and this is
this is why this is why I like I would
never I mean
first off I would never get plastic
surgery but if I ever did they're like
doctors like hey let me get a dick pic
you know before we can like enlarge you
before we actually enlarge your penis to
be 2 inches instead of one let me get a
dick pic so you do before and after I'd
be like off dude there are people
who are like looking for that kind of
 we're like looking to hack
businesses like yours so they can get
dick pics of me and then they're gonna
be super disappointed when they see it
but that's besides the point I don't
know like just don't don't let
anyone take pictures of you naked if
you're gonna send nudes send nudes on
your own time on your own accord don't
let somebody else send the nudes or take
the nudes for you don't send it back up
here be like yeah listen to Kyle yeah
what you're saying is I just how can I
be a hype man for that that's good it's
good at a base so that's that's all I'm
saying this is this is gonna be a
disaster for whoever's involved sucks
sorry guys but you know lesson learned
and all that jazz I'd say if I have my
penis like rebuilt
would want like a time-lapse of it from
multiple angles let's see it happening
I'm just saying and I would probably
make a video of it where where would you
even post something like that like some
channel called gonna have to be cold
like postcards or it wouldn't be a
garage where clogged it'd be it you see
a work log no I'll figure figure out a
name for it well it's hardware if you
know what I mean you're branded yeah
exactly
very good yeah okay it's poop I'm not
not quite secure parts flagged beaten it
yeah exactly
all right asus has released a dual xeon
overclocking motherboards this is from
overclock 3d dotnet c6 to 1e sage
yeah it's a workstation board under that
name features dual LGA 3647 sockets and
an overclocking feature that asus is
claiming is unique to their brand
overclockable Xeon overclockable Zeon's
we had not seen real like actual
overclocking on Zeon's you know for the
most part in quite some time but VGA SR
yes sir to the first I forget which yeah
they mentioned in the article but yes
there was some probably this a similar
thing um and a sister has not gone into
detail as far as how the overclocking
works on this board but it's not
conventional to traditional overclocking
methods that we're familiar with however
that we're used to so bear that in mind
the board still supports six channels of
twenty six 66 megahertz DVR for per CPU
which would allow you to put in 12 dims
of ECC DVR for equating to 384 gigs of
memory if you were using 32 gigs Lexuses
or is a 768 gigs it's like 60
triple-channel or is a 6 channel it is
66 channel 6 channels 6 channels he oh I
got ya pretty gnarly for you dot 2 ports
and one PCIe gen3 by 4 m dot 2 slot you
also get 7 PCIe gen3 slots three of
three of which run an X
team for an X I like I like the vertical
you dot two connectors just chilling
there like as if they were SATA ports
thing this is normal to just have this
mini right you dot to just hanging out I
think some you got two ports went on
strike or something there like we want
equality and then they finally done that
board and everyone's happy
so pricing is unknown about this board
but it's gonna be a lot most likely I
mean the most expensive Xeon on this
socket is like 13 grand 13 grand
yeah for like the flagship Xeon or
whatever it's what is the Xeon Platinum
eight one eight zero and platinum 81 ATM
is goes for 13 grand according to the
article yeah holy so I mean you
know they're targeting a different
demographic than the average gamer with
this board it's cold there's no platinum
note so yes it's platinum must be
awesome it's awesome I would imagine you
know incredible efficiency as well um so
jeez it's it's gotta be it's gotta be a
thousand bucks or more for this board is
my ballpark guess but who knows $8.99
$8.99 yeah just just under that thousand
dollars I'm gonna throw out eight man
units so that way it'll be budget no
price that way they can call it a budget
board no price an article yet this time
asus has not revealed the official
pressing ok no they mo pixel to let's
talk about the pixel to excel and how
it's been having some serious issues
with its display know if like when did
it launch it just launched like barely
mine hasn't even arrived yet hulls
hasn't even arrived and it your phone
already sucks
mine is supposed to bone that you don't
even have yet already sucks oh I want to
kill myself from ARS technica look at
this you're not burning I want to kill
myself look at that notification bar
this is actually taking a from ARS
technica I wanna kill everyone at Google
as a part of their own review of this
this phone that they've only had for two
weeks
this is unacceptable two week old phone
already giving a burn in with the
notification bar that's what this like
that's unacceptable they should can
always add some purposes they should
cancel all phones now
additionally yeah all phones are banned
the phone has been experiencing really
weird blue blue color shifts what if
you're looking at the phone at certain
viewing angles that's by design
ken from Ken news the camera operator
and filmography for Austin Evans was
posting I followed him on Twitter he was
posting some stuff actually doing like
different viewing angles of his phone of
his pixel to excel and it looks pretty
bad he was comparing it to other phones
this is a known issue with many people
not just one or two this is a serious
thing that doesn't count
and the culprit may be the OLED or the P
OLED panels that are being used for the
pixel to excel Peola
Peola it's Poulet should be POS LED yeah
piece of which is unfortunate
because all of the other pixels that
we've had so far pixel 1 pixel 1 Excel
and even pixel 2 non Excel are using
Samsung ol ads which don't seem to have
any issues like this it's only the ones
that are from LG the el cheapo LEDs are
having these issues same as the LG v 30
phone
the LG v 30 is also using the same LG
screen as you might expect and also
having display problems so this is this
is serious serious news guys if you
happen to preorder a pixel to excel god
forbid god help you if you have
pre-ordered a pixel 2x now cancel abort
now press the big red button and get out
just a little do my so I'm supposed to
give my existing pixel XL to my wife
just give me the pixel to I'll just give
her the pencil to she's in the power
user shut her eyes don't work she never
watches her lash she's blind
Paul's wife is buying it don't worry I
figured out that um so that's kind of
suck it just gonna suck my Google's is
it this is an ongoing issue yes clearly
Google being a reputable company with
vast resources will do right by
customers and replace units I would
suffering the kind of
right they kind of have to um like what
would Samsung do with the Galaxy Note I
mean look at that when we get blown up
you have people I would look at I would
look at that for two seconds
yeah and then I would have to commit
suicide I'm there is no excuse it's
really bad
how many weeks permanent look at this
woman it's a slight shift in this
gradient here from this yeah ever this
gray you gotta you got like maybe a
nineteen percent gray here and then it
just jumps yeah it's like this seventeen
percent and there's these slight smudges
it's pretty disgusting I kill it baby
right after became self-aware you can
feel the pain yeah yeah def bang
microwaving all right and and also
Google the Google home Mini just to top
it all off shipped with a top touch
interface talk have you thought
that the Google mini you just constantly
degrades here hit yourself this team if
it is an open racist and just chips away
and yeah you should kill yourself Jesus
why didn't you finish college all your
deepest and darkest secrets just exploit
you for how do you know so much about me
uses all the all everything in Google's
disposal long story short Google I
actually made a link for you guys it's
the let me google that for you okay and
it's it's quality control Google if you
could use your own amazing search engine
to Google quality control because all
the that's going down right now on
your end it's yes it makes you wonder
what is the control prompt the quality
control process like over there things
are just going awry but that's okay
everyone click that link I can't I'm
actually curious to see if your phone
turns out let's move on though we've got
one two more stories here we'll be right
along the gtx 1070 TI's have been listed
on lines from vo cars.com i'm going to
go through this quickly because we're
short on time here there are gonna be
three variants from asus 2 which are
Strix models the third one is a turbo so
probably gonna have like a blower style
cooler on it some of the cheapest models
that i've seen here are running for 600
euros again this is not a fully trusted
source or anything but 600 euro is about
$700 u.s. which is about $200 more 150
dollars more than a GTX 1080 right now
so or about the same as you'd pay for a
1080i yes exactly
or like you know an RX make a 64 for
example how dare is videos think they
can charge people this much for this
graphics card hopefully that's not the
case and they don't charge that much
otherwise no one will buy it oh wait
this is a video cards article and it's
unsubstantiated yes things from apps
retail websites and different places on
my grain of salt I wanted to point out
when people were pointing at stuff like
this when I used to when I used to work
at Newegg certain times they would have
you know they make a product listing
before the product is actually available
for sale mm-hmm the default for product
listings that weren't actually live or
active yet was to set the price to
ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety
nine dollars why is that the default I
don't know that might have been the max
price they could actually set for a
product since they might not have sold
anything that was worth more than that
but yeah you could and every once in a
while somebody would find a link to a
product page that wasn't supposed to be
active yet but if you have the link you
can still go there and
yeah yeah something like that so um
would you see my tweet earlier today
when I was on the Amazon and the
expedited shipping was just there's only
1 million dollars that was your tweet I
think that must have been multiple
people I saw someone tweet the same
thing I think it was today yeah there
may be the Sun that's good to them oh I
guess yeah if it was a widespread bug or
something yeah yeah yeah but yeah it was
like a it was like a wig for my
Halloween costume is like expedited
shipping a million dollars and it
wouldn't even get here in time for the
Halloween party rigged up like a million
dollars and I go you can get it whatever
it's like any justice possible if you
just would take a shot in the dark city
because dude let me drive to Seattle or
whatever one of your warehouses I'll be
quicker but also interesting if you
scroll to the Auris the Auris extreme
there it is we're gonna display outputs
the video outs each what which
which the article is saying this is
definitely photoshopped but it seems to
be officially announced from from
gigabyte so we know that this card is
simply a photoshopped picture but we
still posted here in this article about
1080i being affirmed so just pay that no
mind people and you can sow seeds of
okay basically yes and finally we've got
our just a quick discussion on the
windows small creators update all
creator updates this is a video from the
ever so knowledgeable and amazing ever
boxed Steve is the best he is the
benchmark King as of now and he was just
doing a little bit of research looking
at some other youtubers who were finding
some wild
performance games with FCU John Joe Teti
reductions joker productions they all we
all hate Joker now no Jokers cool guy he
was showing up to 20% 20% gains in a
couple games actually and then gamers
Nexus came in with their own benchmarks
with risin and
GTX 1080i of course most of their tests
were CPU bound so they didn't see much
of a performance gain gamers Nexus also
didn't test Vega they didn't test Vega
either Steve did Steve did just like
Joker productions tested with Vega
and it was Vega and what was that what
was the CPU 77 okay yes and then her one
box tested the same configuration but
also did a couple variants because
they're awesome with Rison 1600 X and
coffee like 80 600 K and etc and they
found pretty much like gamers XS if
there was very little performance gain
from the creator updates The Fault
creator update which makes sense I mean
it's kind of outlandish to think that
you could gain 20% in performance and
frame rates for example just from one of
these updates it's it would have been
unprecedented had that been the actual
case so this goes to show like
definitely you know watch a variety of
youtubers and content creators and
reviewers when it comes to things like
this more technical data so you have a
wider sample size instead of just you
know focusing on you know your your one
or two favorite guys even if it happens
to be us because that could be
misleading so the wrong yes and we are
never wrong but guys feel free to share
your own experiences with FCU if you
happen to update it recently update it
if they to it recently I'm curious to
hear if you guys have been experiencing
more like what hardware in box saw or
more on the Joker production side yes
but I have not updated
I don't think yet have you to the fall
creators update right no you know
hotline still in Windows 8.1 believe it
or not yeah yeah hey you know what at
least I can resize my browser's
perfectly fine that is true the handles
at the queers in the windows of Windows
10 pissed me then yes they are a
nuisance actually engineer what's been
you I need admit I wanna make a shirt
video and I might do it I love it
already
do you have homegroup set up not really
I only have like network discovery
turned on but
like an actual homegroup you know share
between computers or whatever
not really so like when you have a home
group home group set up and you open up
just a regular Explorer window to browse
files or whatever like I always want to
click on like this PC or one of the
shortcuts right up here but every time I
open it it opens and shows the list and
then there's a short pause and then it
pops up the home group thing and then it
jumps the list down to where the home
group is that's annoying and then it
like here I can actually show you guys
right now
watch let's see it so like I want to
click up and then it changes oh Jesus it
jumps around yeah I've actually noticed
something similar to that I don't know
if it was with homegroup but I've
definitely been like in this in the file
explorer trying to click on like my my
um editing driver whatever and it'll
kind of skip around sometimes I don't
happen often I really like the show have
shortcuts lists but it seems to be like
it it's a delay that always for me or at
least very frequently syncs up with me
with how you like I'm about to like that
damn when you miss click something it
down and write that is super annoying
yeah um but thank you hardware unboxed
for all of your hard work Steve and you
guys they're doing a great job keep it
up and then ask people this question um
we can skip it everybody nobody hear
about your response that's fine because
we're short on time we may have some
stuff so we can go over some donations

wouldn't have taken much but still have
done sexual favors have a little bar

okay sorry dude monetize bag well Mike
I'm glad I'm glad you can get fully
fully cut up on the shovel first

Jake 3d five bucks have you ever used
under eight I'm setting up my old PC as
an ass and security camera system in May
through throw in my nine 80s for crypto
mining I've never used on raid I haven't
either
my dabbling into that area has mainly
pointed me towards ZFS options
freenas yeah so I never never never
checked out the Unrated stuff so I can't
give you any journey feedback there yep
but thank you very much for you don't he
seems like a good use for your old
hardware though yep Robert do I hear
five bucks thanks for the case
recommendation last week you are welcome
thanks for the laughs in education
you're welcome also our Vardar fans the
best for radiators that is the best I
there's a lot of fans out there it's
hard to say which fans are the best I
don't know watching an antique video or
an article reading around people usually
part where point towards like Noctua n
ff12 is the current pinnacle of a fan
yeah technology but there's a lot that
are like right up there with them so
right there's lots of options some
research bears are quite good to them
yeah done sander five bucks when the new
Nvidia 2000 series comes out should I
get a 1080 TI after the price drop or
get the 2070 I feel both will end up
being similarly priced we have real
really no way of knowing how to answer
that question until we know more about
the GTX 2070 so
asked us that question again in a few
months
yes Silvio Silvio Alcantara again with
the most awesome last name ever
ten bucks hey guys I want to do a custom
water cooling loop trying to decide
which brand to use all youtubers seem to
use ek water blocks or bits power what's
the deal with excess PC thank you for
your advice I am one of I'm guilty as a
you know one of the ek water blocks
users I've pretty much been using them
since the beginning and I don't really
have too much experience with other
water cooling hardware extensively so I
can't speak on behalf of an excess PC
orbits but I know bits power is very
popular for their fittings in particular
excess PC I know that they've got some
well well well received radiators and
things like that but I can't say I've
ever had any personal experience with
their their Hardware alpha cool is also
out there they make a lot of good
products that have good feedback
I mean ek is is often view just kind of
like the like I feel like ek me in the
water cooling realm is kind of like a
Seuss's isn't in the motherboard realm
you know there's lots of options with
motherboards Asus tends to have the
highest end ones and some of the ones
that have some of the you know yeah
upper stuff ek they do a really good job
they make really nice blocks they're
very efficient they're very well
designed jaded a very recently on some
of the variations and differences
between specific GPU blocks and stuff
that I thought was very fairly
interesting but yeah these are the
companies they also make stuff they're
like they're they work they're
functional they're probably within you
know I'd have to go and compare them
head-to-head against each other shrimp
to say one way or the other but um
excess PC has been around for a while
and I know I've heard good at good
things about their products and I've
used a few of their like bits and pieces
here and there pretty much he'll that's
another company that stands out to me
that there's a lot of good products you
fan tax has also been coming out with a
lot of water cooling stuff of course
Sarah keeps talking about it but I think
it's actually just rebranded brandy
other stuff most likely I forget and
feel free to you know read it read any
of the comments in chat I know a lot of
people in chat actually have experience
with some of this hardware I just
suggest you know fact-checking
everything that you see there to be sure
on your purchasing decision but good
luck either way we've got my knee
five dollars Paul beats off yes he does
as we as we as we found out earlier
earlier today lots of things beat off
it's been proven lots of thing pretty
much everything beats off so you know
big deal almost not expected everything
beats off wildlife struggle to which is
a little disturbing expect and every and
everyone at their five dollars when the
us think we'll see Vega add inboard
variations like the asus rog Strix
they've been teased for a while now but
no word your guess as good as ours man i
would feel like they're gone around i
have one i feel like before the holiday
before they before christmas before
Black Friday maybe maybe mid-november
maybe late November can't imagine much
later than that but there's a shortage
bro there's a huge shortage things are
complicated you know
for many reasons all we can do is hope
that it's sooner than later sorry we
can't give me any more info than that
Carl Hall five Canadians
Kyle you might you're all a beer with
this then you have to suffer the wifey
sauces humiliation for having to let
Paul drink without you that does sound
like it
haha terrible punishment I would never
subject myself to it but thank you very
much for the donation unless Heather
Hansen hey wifey sauce five dollars
don't be so hard on yourself your pecker
is 1.5 inches not one love wifey sauce
Wow see she actually she has like like
like number dyslexia where she missed
places the the period so your penis is
actually 51 inches long no 15 of
Dean yeah she just moves but she tends
to move the period loud the doesn't over
the decimal the decimal yes so that's
that's the word I was looking for pecker
that's an interesting euphemism pecker
is she she's part French and pecker was
like an old way is the old way of French
people saying Godzilla you're Godzilla
basically what she's saying is you're
Godzilla is 15 inches not one and she's
totally right
she also said one love which is like Bob
Marley reference it is yeah see she's
very loving person
k3 7:07 2003 candelas EVGA for the win
KX 299 or a pre-ordered rog extreme I
can get a for the win K much sooner and
it's half the price I already have the
extreme pre-ordered can't make up my
mind well for half the price I mean
there's a lot you can do with that money
elsewhere in your system yeah so upgrade
your GPU get a better SSD I haven't
looked directly at the for the win K but
I do like EVGA kind of being one of the
like CAD the only company that's really
been like you know what the RGB thing
they do have some RGB products but the
majority of their motherboards mmm don't
have RGB it's it's only in their premium
lineup that has it so that's kind of
cool and I mean paying extra for
something like that when you're not
really into it mm-hmm doesn't make that
much sense so I would double check the
power delivery make sure it's got at
least eight and a 4-pin supplemental CPU
power connector on for the 1k which you
very much might might have I'm just not
positive haven't looked directly at that
one so as long as you have decent power
delivery and decent cooling on the power
delivery then I would say go with that
because the benefits you get from the
rog extreme are gonna be fairly limited
unless you're doing like crazy high end
overclocking or yeah you know exotic
cooling or
kind of thing right four-way 3-way 4-way
GP configurations most people won't
utilize all the features on that board
yeah to be honest for it to actually be
worth it but to each their own
and finally we've got Timothy Stein for
the 10 bucks oh hey Kyle I need your
expertise recently upgraded to a 144
Hertz monitor with G sync and when I
wake up my PC or restart it sometimes my
desktop icons get moved to the middle of
the display help well
icons are getting move to the mill
display every time you wake your PC or
restart it that's interesting for me
that usually happens when the computer
thinks that the monitor isn't there
anymore which usually has something to
do with the power connection for the
monitor most monitors that I have that
stay plugged in the computer will
remember the monitors and the layout and
where the icons go so perhaps it has
something to do with like do you have
like a power strip or something that
you're turning out it turns off all the
power to you monitor and that kind of
thing maybe that's making it forget
beyond that I know there's third-party
applications and stuff that you can do
that are just UI functionality wise
stuff that might repositions things and
maybe that is something that could could
ya help stuff yeah yeah bigger question
is why you should why is your computer
ever asleep or off you should just leave
it on constantly 24/7 and never never
put it to sleep computers don't need
sleep unlike us take advantage of that
what are you doing are you texting yes
okay enjoy as a wife lose the past you
get a pass okay but we do have some
Johnson shadow Johnson's before we close
