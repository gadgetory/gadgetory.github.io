rule of thumb to never let your frame
rate dipped below 30 FPS when you're
playing a video game however just
because you might be achieving an
average FPS of 30 or above doesn't
necessarily mean that your frame 8 never
dips below 30 because there are certain
graphically intensive moments in your
game that might cause it to drop down
just like that so with that said I'm
going to be benchmarking three different
cards today and seeing what the highest
optimal settings each of them can
operate at in crysis 3 before the frame
rate ever dips below 30 so this I know
this is kind of a experimental
benchmarking video that I'm doing here
but hopefully by the end of it you'll
have a better idea of which settings you
should be operating at to play crysis 3
smoothly and consistently and this is
especially going to be relevant to those
of you who actually own one of the cards
that i'm testing today so with that said
why don't we take a look at the
benchmark loop that I ran for all of
these tests okay so this is literally
the first mission of the campaign but it
has a ton of shadows and several
explosive barrels that actually produce
quite a bit of smoke and particle
effects I'm also happy to announce that
I did run this test at both 1920 x 1080
and 2560 x 1600 resolutions
unfortunately I didn't buy a high res
panel or anything like that guys I'm
just borrowing it from a friend or so he
thinks for my testing procedure I
initially ran each of the cards at max
settings and gradually scaled them back
until the minimum frame rate was just
above 30 FPS at that point i left the
settings alone and proceeded to run this
loop five times for each card at both
resolutions after benchmarking all the
runs with fraps I simply took the
average min Max and average frame rates
and package them all nicely into a
pretty chart which i'm going to show you
in a second so we'll let the rest of
this loop finish out and then we'll go
over the hardware i use
Flame I just Caleb okay
so if you guys have been keeping up with
my recent videos you'll notice that this
slide looks quite a bit different than
what it usually does and that's simply
because I got a hold of some pretty
awesome high-end hardware that I'm
really just borrowing like the high res
panel that I mentioned earlier so you
can see here I've temporarily upgraded
to a 30 960 X as well as an asus rampage
for formula and 16 gigs of awesome
g.skill trident x clocked at 1600
megahertz and the cards that I used for
this test were the geforce gtx titan the
reference gtx 680 as well as the
reference radeon HD 7970 and you can see
I've updated to the latest drivers and
all that jazz but moving on to our first
test at 1920 x 1080 you can see here
that the titan even when overclocked was
a just barely this is super close to
achieving full max settings but i did
have to bump down the ass tropic
filtering to 8x when crysis 3 gives you
the option to go all the way up to 16 x
but you can see there i still got 53.8
frames per second on average and the car
does come with its temp target already
set at 80 degrees so you can see that
there in red all the max attempts by the
way are there listed in red next to
their respective cards by moving on to
the reference gtx 680 actually why don't
we just talk about that and the 7970
together because they kind of go hand in
hand on this slide you can see that all
the settings for both cards are exactly
the same but if you look to the chart to
the right you can see that the 680
clearly did better as far as frames per
second go so it got 66.1 on average
whereas the 7970 was only able to
achieve 60.1 frames per second with the
same settings now 2560 by 1600
resolution this is where I really
started to have to make some sacrifices
with the Titan even overclocked I had to
pump down all the system specs to high
as well as the texture resolution and
you can see there SMAA and anisotropic
filtering both took a hit had to reduce
both of those to 2x if you take a look
at the average frames per second there
on the right you can see that with the
680 and the 7970 they both got in the
exact same score at 55.4 FPS but just
like the last slide this isn't a tie
because if you look at the settings for
the 7970 i was able to achieve that
score at four
anisotropic filtering whereas a 680 had
to be bumped down to 1x just to keep up
but unfortunately for both cards I had
to completely disable anti-aliasing and
all the system specs had to be bumped
down to medium all right guys and there
you have it and really quickly I did
want to point out that you don't have to
necessarily use the same settings that i
did in order to achieve those same frame
rates you could have bumped down your
anisotropic filtering to 4x and
essentially doubled your SMA as long as
it balances out you're going to get
similar results as I did relatively
speaking but it all really comes down to
what you prioritize in your gameplay
experience aside from that what do you
guys think of this kind of testing do
you find this kind of information useful
or beneficial to you or should I stop
doing it and carry on with something
else I'm really curious to know so leave
your thoughts in the section below and
that's gonna do it for this video thank
you all for watching be sure to thumbs
up this video if you found it
informative and yeah subscribe to
awesome sauce news if you haven't
already and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
