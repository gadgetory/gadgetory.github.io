foot yeah thanks for doing that
very helpful don't ruin our stream all
right
oh wait are we used for me to both now
you know right we're gonna bed right in
this time frame right about you can't
give or take in a second or two
all right hey I'm going everyone welcome
back this is awesome hardware episode
180
hi guys side B if you missed side a
check it out on Paul's half or on Paul's
channel youtube.com slash Paul's
Hardware you can find like in my video
description below if you're joining us
on Twitch
then hello good to see you guys again
this is a live show that we do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware as well and we'll be
doing an after party at the end of this
half to go over all the donation
comments that you guys have been giving
us throughout the show
and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson's as well for our
respective I don't know bad stuff doors
to buy stuff from the speaking of stores
my store is big with tech that you can
now you can buy lots of merchandise here
mugs glasses mouse pads sweaters
sunglasses mugs there's there's lots of
stuff here decals and there's still
fidget spinners that are still fitted
spinners this is like three years I'm
gonna I'm gonna email John and ask him
how many agents Ben ever loved because
it's in the single digits really wish I
had sold all those when the Fed was
still going strong well that's something
that just like climate is bad just
immediately just nobody you never hear
about him anymore I'm so glad I didn't
double down on your shipments there and
then Paul store is Paul's Harbor yeah
he's got a lot of stuff as well
including a brand new t-shirt new
designer shirt mug and
he's gonna sweaters and stuff with this
design some captive thumbscrew design
everyone go pick one up
look at how lean how sad he looks well
good thumbscrews doing hard time hard
super heart stealer wondering wonder way
is in for heart of Steel it's probably
in for screwing and screwing too hard
without consent that's that's probably
true it's good thing using an isolate
itself alright and thank you to our good
friend speaking of cells cell processing
and chats the guys are rating appreciate
you we love you and I don't know spider
fans here head of yes I wanted to give a
shout-out to Britta who did the design
for that shirt there I will done you can
find her on Facebook terror bunny
studios just wishes an awesome name
twofer reminds me of a money price on
the evil bunny yes alright so we've got
some news to talk about gun my half as
well starting with the sort of the the
one that's been taking over all the tech
sites lately about Nvidia going to by
Israel's mellow know and I'm sorry
did I mention we have a laser-guided
show drinking that's a block remind
occasional adult language yep both of
those lost goes great late I'm gonna
kill this and then drink my own great
weight mm-hmm so Nvidia like I was
saying is set to buy Mellanox which is a
data center company therefore they're
based in Israel but they're they're
about to buy them for 6.8 I'm still
ready six point nine billion dollars
it's a clear thing some sources say six
point nine so they're rounding and some
people are just saying flat seven I
think when you're in the billions
whatever seven billion it's about seven
billion dollars that's a hundred
thousand dollars know a lot more than
that but the difference between six
point eight and six point nine billion
Oh hundred thousand every I'm saying
who's like goes it's like yeah it's just
a couple blocks pocket change
yeah right I'm chained right there it's
like sorry are you sure 200k let me dig
in the couch cushions all venmo the rest
you so they beat Nvidia actually beat
out Intel's bid you don't Intel if
that's a big like you know it's notch in
your belt we
Intel Jensen flexing right there
Jensen's dick just got two inches bigger
so this is basically to help boost the
company's two data center business
that's a hundred million Thank You Chet
oh wait my math skills are horrible well
you're being serious I thought you were
joking I thought you were saying I
thought you really don't remember math
skills were so horrible just say yes by
three digits I didn't correct you can I
thought it was intentional I was like
yeah very funny you're right it was
intentional go home Paul you're drunk
hashtag why Paul chat that's why I'm bad
at business okay so this is this is a
CNBC article that we're pulling up here
they actually got on the phone with
Jensen and a quote from him said the
data centers become the most important
computer in the world the thing that's
really exciting is that the computer no
longer starts and ends at the server the
computer in the future would extend into
the network and what we want to do is we
want to extend our computing reach from
the server where we are today out to the
entire data center so we're trying to
make it interconnected Lee you know just
enough by acquiring a company like
Mellanox they they acquire something
they don't necessarily have which is
years and years of experience of data
center activity and and growth so this
is sort of a way to fast-track them in
that realm to help them with I mean any
number of things i mean AI and deep
learning all that stuff machine learning
as well as potentially what i would care
most about is like video games streaming
like could this fast-track them with
their geforce now program things like
that so it's still unclear exactly how
nvidia is going to take advantage of
this acquisition but it seems like it's
going through it seems like it's
happening the deal is expected to close
by the end of 2019 and the shares for
both companies are up
so if you're into trading stock or
anything then you should be happy or sad
about that depending on how you've been
handling that but yeah 7 billion dollar
acquisition from an video was you
weren't sure ting Nvidia yes should be
fine can't shit baby catch that stock
out yeah all right let's move on Intel
cascade Lake and cascade Lake X set
first at four Computex debut this is
from how hard we're featuring a leak
from chip L member Momo suggesting that
cascade Lake is pegged for an April
launch that's right around the corner
and then cascade Lake X would be
unveiled at Computex in late May early
June which I'll be going to so maybe I
can confirm that to you guys yeah Momo
suspects that LGA
36:47 which is using a more or less xeon
socket and cascade lake with LGA 2066
that would be cascade like X they're
expected to arrive first and these will
these bowl of course friable AMD's
upcoming 7 nanometre rise and chips and
rise and thread river trips potentially
that we mentioned earlier so exciting
there's not a lot to write on here other
than cascade lake is is a thing it's
it's the natural cascade Lake X is the
natural successor to skylake X I hope
they don't I hope they've learned their
lesson from sky like X and they don't
have like weird skis that don't make
sense and try to segment their CPUs and
motherboards into into categories that
that don't really that don't really make
sense like what they did with KB like X
so they don't yeah they're they're still
gonna do that but why they couldn't have
sold many KB like X CPUs isn't this the
platform that they were supposed to wash
the W 3175 on by the end of 2018
that's the dontist chip right the one
that yeah yeah I think you're I think I
think 28 core yes right so
as part of the that would be LGA 3647 it
just seems odd to me that they're now
saying like April launch for cascade
Lake LGA 3647 isn't that already
launched or was it just I don't know
just a few samples that have been sent
around to leichter Bower and and I think
that's what it was it doesn't ever have
like a paper lon like an official launch
date behind it it was just kind of yeah
Sam's I mean I've complained about that
we've mentioned yeah that that like they
were like all right watching this badass
5 you know 5 gigahertz capable processor
by the end of 2018
yeah which they can it it but like you
can't you could use mine where I won no
income no I was already who anyway just
just it's got to point that out when
this comes up because it was promised
much earlier anyway at the same time I
don't think it's necessarily I think
cash gave like X is gonna be what most
people have their eyes on probably just
because it's gonna be buggy that's much
more practical the mother bird probably
won't cost $1,800 what's the Dominus
extreme yeah it's like yeah to lose two
grand something like that yeah you won't
need a thousand dollar case to say out
of English people's range yeah but the
context so look forward to that so
potentially it's early as April if
you're interested in the Z on side of
things and then Computex we should be
hearing more information about cascade
Lake X high-end desktop platform
successor to skeletons fun okay
I next up we have an article from
overclocked 3d net about the GTX 1660
non ti that actually going to be
releasing soon it's apparently a
appeared in an Ashes of the singularity
benchmark chart ah this is a rumor to
arrive very soon it's the lowest price
it will be allegedly the lowest price
Turing GPU yet and this first
performance leak that we're getting is
thanks to tomb at the sack to map Zack
to map a sack revealing the cards GP
performance in in this in this title the
results of course everyone wants to know
this was tested in the extreme preset at
10
P the GTX 1660 scored 5700 points which
is about 600 points behind the 1660 TI
but also 500 points above the gtx 1060
which is of course a pascal card so it
seems to sit if these are removed if
these rumors are to be true it seems to
sit just between a gtx 1060 and a gtx
1660 TI with the rumored price the
rumored launch price of $219 that
actually makes it a pretty compelling
option considering that's relatively on
the low end of what you could get a gtx
1066 gigabyte card for so if you're
getting you know a decent chunk of
performance for the same price then then
all is good but again don't know if
these are true we when they came out
with the 1660 TI i was like no way
is there gonna be just a 1660 that's
insane I mean I'm joking of course I'd
be like as if they came out with like
predator 2 and they're like wolf
there's no predator but before they came
out with predator in it was there gonna
be a predator or like Star Wars Episode
4 yeah yeah I guess no possible way a 1
or 2 could be coming so the you know
logic would dictate that a 1660 exists
yeah and they want you to know if this
is true then people who have 1660s
should disconnect from the internet when
they're running benchmarks if they don't
want to map a sec to pull their
benchmark results up and indeed make an
article on the internet whatever they do
maybe they want the glory that could be
could be my eternal glory there's also
been some pictures leaked just to you
know put the nail in the coffin for yeah
this this GPU is definitely real unless
of course all these images are shopped
but it doesn't look to be that way it's
hard to say really this is from
overclocked 3d don't notice well these
are all MSI cards and they seem to be
using the same coolers that are based on
their RT GTX 1660 TI cards so I'm not
much
changed but you can see sort of the 1660
branding on on the box alright but I
thought you could maybe not but you've
got the gaming X model which is gonna be
the sort of flagship from MSI and then
is that an armor I forget what they're
calling but they're cheaper cars
probably armor superb I don't know I
don't know what they call it cards yeah
neither do I haven't even fought yet but
the articles there I personally think
that the gaming X cards look really nice
I have a 1660 ti oh yeah that was just
sent to me and it looks it looks really
nice it's got an RGB it's - it's
tasteful though you know it's tasteful
RGB and unplastered the implementation
is really good there's no like LED
hotspots or anything and the cool
adjusting is well built it seems doesn't
seem cheap at all they are a little
vertically like why they come up a
little bit more than some cards do so
yes that can be in very small cases of
potential conflict but mm-hmm you can
see it's got a single 8 pin now you say
a connector as well so hopefully we'll
get to hear more about that later it's
expected to launch March 14th
allegedly so keep your eyes peeled
that's in two days
holy smokes alright next up we've got an
article from hexxus this is a pretty
quick one it's about the Galaxy S 10
particularly its face unlock feature
that allows for a human face to unlock
your phone being hacked very easily they
actually implemented or embedded a unbox
therapy video where Lou actually
demonstrates his Galaxy S 10 being
unlocked by simply pulling up another
phone playing his YouTube video oh of
his face it's really just like a
close-up shot of his face
and it's moving like his face his moods
video he hasn't posited he's actually
moving and it's not like the most
crystal clear shot of his face either
and he just puts one phone up to the the
galaxy s10 and it unlocks it with with
little to no effort whatsoever so
unfortunately no one really has access
to unbox therapy videos so I think oh
yes some of the most obscure and hard to
find videos on the web yeah there it is
so he just unlocked the phone with
another phone using public YouTube video
and like you just move around those
fingerprints those fingerprints on the
screen there's shit in the way come on
like there's literally like it's come on
Sam's it's virtually pointless to have
this as a feature and it's virtually
it's potentially irresponsible because
well Samsung does give you a little
prompt when you opt in for the face
unlock feature it does say this is not
the most secure option if you want full
security or better security we suggest
the fingerprint scanner it's still like
what is the point of it oh if you could
literally unlock it that easily do you
only mean like is it just a marketing
thing for non techie people to be like
ooh that looks cool and futuristic I'm
gonna buy it but then get potentially
reamed in the a sport for using it when
when you know they lose their phone or
somebody is able to invade their privacy
so easily even if you're not a big
youtuber like glue I mean most people
have pictures of them all over the
internet whether it's Facebook or
Twitter or Instagram you know and if you
can just take some shoddy video and
unlock his phone so easily I mean it
could be done anywhere there's also been
reports of face and lock being
compromised with people using photos and
sometimes not even of the person whose
phone it is sometimes it's just someone
who looks like them or a relative or
someone who doesn't even really look
like them so basically it's it's useless
it's scary it's a useless feature that
the little prompt that Samsung brings up
when you're about to use it I don't
think is enough if they should they
should probably just disable it I would
think if it's that because because there
are some people who are gonna be stupid
enough to you
thinking it's safe and ignoring the the
prompt which you know it is their fault
if their phone gets hacked you should
have been smarter about it but not
everyone's not everyone like I don't
know it's weird phones should only
unlock with a drop of blood it needs
like direct DNA each unlock requires a
bloodsucker yes yeah it does it does a
DNA check that's the only way to truly
be secured a built-in finger prick like
it like a little needle that just goes
and just pricks your finger you said put
on the sensor
you'd be UV secure except for against
the scrolls the scrolls win cuz they do
they replicate the DNA one day
hey are you talking about this uh
Captain Marvel guy Captain Marvel this
weekend guys that's good as today
elected to ya straight damn sprawls um
Larry where was I so DNA replication
that's all DNA replication on that note
we'll move on to the next door
this articles from kick dirt it's about
this should have been in a hot and heavy
hardware type of segment but I didn't
have enough hot maybe hardware to talk
about so here it is news this is about
asus rog Strix XG 49 vq it is a 49 inch
super ultra wide damn gaming monitor
where as the image
where's the image like it guru other it
is sorry such as loves taking its time
to load so wow that's substantial so
it's a 38 40 by 1080 which is damn full
HD as well it's an HD right there
144 Hertz we've seen motor 780 right
it's dudes dual 10 1869
says the side by side alright and like I
don't people like I understand people
people say this is way too big of a
monitor but yet you put 2 1080 panels
side-by-side and no one bats an eye so
it's really not that bad
I don't think it's that bad but I still
do understand why people might not want
a 1080 court like vertical pixels it
might look a little squished again
everyone's got the
preference you know 144 hurts though
meaning that this is really tailored for
a gaming audience and there's there's a
bunch of features packed in here they're
really trying to push Asus is really
trying to push HDR here with this panel
living up to the HDR standard there's a
proprietary backlight technology that
incorporates additional LEDs to sort of
serve as a light guide that there's like
a light guide another proprietary light
guide film that increases the overall
brightness so you have a lot more nits
than you otherwise would while you're
using HDR so it doesn't mean you have
HDR you have that nice contrast and
breadth of colors but you're not really
compromising on luminosity there's a
smart HDR tech built-in that offers a
bunch of preset modes and can
automatically change your display
configured in your display for the best
possible HDR output depending on the
scenario if you're watching a movie
playing a game aces shadow boosts game
plus hotkeys for quick access to ingame
enhancements a lot of these features
sort of near that gigabyte the gigabyte
panel that just came out because the the
one that we saw it see yes like for
instance there's a built-in crosshair
overlay option which other monitors have
done in the past as well there's an
on-screen timer you get an FPS counter
and an ultra-low blue light filter
there's and this can all be controlled
via the the asus display widget which i
think i think that's built-ins of the
monitor and stuff so it would
technically free up your system
resources weight you can control the
monitor with the monitors controls
that's apparently this black magic I
know it's amazing
I don't really understand it's launching
this month apparently for a thousand
pounds in the UK what what's a thousand
pounds that's like 1,300 US maybe yes
Cal that is 1307 dollars and 59 I know
my United States Dollars there it is if
you're looking at nine
we're British pounds sterling I guess
the other reason for 3840 by 1080 and
not making it a 1440p panel is that it's
potentially easier to drive yeah with
like a single high end GPU I think
that's a lot of a big reason why they do
it it it's it's expensive I mean if
those shoe boxes a lot for somebody to
drop but that one's gonna love it but it
does seem like they're hitting some some
pretty nice points some pretty nice spec
points yeah it comes to a gaming monitor
ultra wide monitors are really really
fun to play games on if the game
supports it so that's that's one thing
to keep in mind not all games like
overwatch for example you can't play at
all you can plan I'll try but it it
crops sixteen by nine yeah yeah the high
refresh rate at the HDR I think this
yeah I'm sure there's gonna be some
interest in that so cool and then the
last article here is from ARS technica
just a brief mention this doesn't this
isn't super PC related at all but you
just wanted to say Bandersnatch
I just like this I just like the word
Bandersnatch and I also watch the
frabjous spenders net and they should
shut your Bandersnatch right now so I
say the wife used us every night so
Netflix is planning to make more
interactive shows like Bandersnatch
because it was it was such a hit if you
guys aren't familiar Bandersnatch is a
sort of black mirror movie it was a
full-featured movie that was interactive
you could actually choose what the
characters did with the main character
dick anything from what serial it chose
to if it wanted to you know if you
wanted him to like you know throw
something at his dad or show him mercy
all kinds of weird things and obviously
black manure is a very dark type of
series so it was a very dark dramatic
movie but Netflix is very much
considering expanding the genres into
say comedy or romantic films should this
person go out with him or him you know
whatever so there's there's a lot of
possibilities with an interactive film
it very much reminds me of like the
goose bump books like you know choose
your
adventure if you want to go with the old
man in the alleyway turn turn to page 35
if you want to stay behind with your
friend let's go to 38 go to 138 whatever
I want to old man an alleyway yeah I
mean what how could that end badly so
there's a there's I think it's cool I
think happens next if what happens next
I made my choice keep going what I must
know what the old man does to my
butthole so yeah there's there's a lot
of possibilities here
it's it'll be interesting to see if this
is sort of a flash in the pan and type
of feature that like oh it was fun and
then it kind of fizzled out that no one
ever uses anymore or if this could be
sort of a breakthrough in in film and
you know the entertainment industry if
we're gonna start to see more
interactive content go mainstream as
opposed to just sort of a specialty
niche kind of audience thing so yeah I
just I was a fan of the movie it's cool
you get alternate endings it kind of
feels like a video game in the sense
like a massive thing did you like watch
it twice I do not want you twice I
probably will go back in sometime
actually and watched it also okay I only
watched it once but but I did you know I
I got an okay I actually didn't get a
very good ending I should I should watch
it again
it's kind of weird too in that sense
because it becomes like a video game
where it's like oh I didn't like that
and you let me go play it again but
instead you're watching it again so it's
it's not quite as engaging as a video
game I would say because some scenes you
have to watch again you know if you're
learning so is there some equivalent to
if I remember reading choose your own
adventure books and we come to a
decision that wouldn't want to being
decisive so I would hold my place there
and I'd go to both locations so I'd end
up right being reading a choose your own
adventure books I was like four fingers
in different places in the book as I
read through two different like
alternate sort of plot lines yes I think
I think we all think I think a lot of us
did that I did that as well
maybe what you can't do is they need
some equivalent of that for Netflix if
they really want
I know it's cheating it's not cheating
and it's a book
I can manipulate a book I want it's not
a goddamn test all right and plus the
reason I did that is because there are
some decisions that really were
meaningless like yeah didn't matter
which decision you made it race lead
back to the same Center which is the
same as there are certain choices that
you make that you think are gonna lead
somewhere and it's just kind of dead
ends and then it brings you back to the
last point where you make the decision
again so it is in a sense it's like
there are parts where it's just the
illusion of choice but it's really
steering you towards a certain direction
but I think at some point there are
crucial decisions that need to be made
that do affect this is the plot in
serious ways so kind of interesting you
guys haven't checked it out in you have
Netflix go ahead and give me an endorse
worth a check but finally one other word
comes from me Bandersnatch yeah no
really I don't think so that's from a
poem from the Oh God
was the author that's was brillig and
the slithy Toves did gyre and gimble in
the wave all mimsy were the borogroves
and the mome Raths outgrabe it's it's a
the Jabberwock Jabberwocky
sorry you ever walk Jabberwocky Lewis
Carroll yes uh okay cool it's a fun poem
because it's mostly nonsense words so
much it's fun to read because it's it's
crazy how he made up all these nonsense
words and you read it and you know
anything like it yeah right
Gaelic and the slithy Toves did gyre and
gimble in the wave that's what I just
that's what I just said do you know no I
only know that all mimsy were the
borogroves and the mome Raths outgrabe
yes beware the Jabberwock my son eyes
that the jaws would bite the jaws that
bite the claws the catch beware the
Jubjub bird and shun the frem just
Bandersnatch the previous vendors nice
yeah yeah huh there's also a Monty
Python or might not be its specific
Monty Python but it's a Monty Python
adjacent the Jabberwocky movie which is
a little abstract that's fun if you play
that I guess busy let's do it
um okay so we have Randy Randy mr. Randy
MEK cheese core i5 4590 with 16 gigs of
guile dagger ddr3 I don't like saying
that word because it rhymes with my name
yield oh it feels weird let's call it
Gil denial yeah
guile sounds like someone saying my name
guile ddr3 XFX r9 270 a sorry nice note
side panels are proper hard drive cage
but adventures alright well the tape on
that we've got some yellow electrical
tape holding down what appears to be a
2.5 inch mechanical hard drive with a
SATA cable tape tape to it or something
I don't know why that SATA cables going
across it zoom in enhance
yanks what's going on here what you need
a well there's a there's another Drive
underneath it a flip mounted I've done
this before it looks like you might have
used standoffs even to put some space
between the 2.5 inch drive in the 3u 3.5
inch travel but yeah I appreciate this
is this is some ingenuity right here
what's with the tape though I think this
this SATA cable probably going down to
the 3.5 inch drive that's my guess so
all that tapes just for a SATA cable I
mean it might also beats a hole well I
was gonna say it to hold the drive on
itself but then it kind of looks like
it's got some standoffs or something
hold it does that right I'm so confused
yeah we're so confused here maybe only
No all right now we've got some like
it's almost like greatest hits of the
things we usually complain about when it
comes to fit my PC submissions we have a
stock heatsink fan on the CPU we've got
a catchment Mustard cables not only that
but we've got the white whoo-hoo 24 pin
white 24 pin plug rarely seen but I'll
always clashing and not looking very
good it's like the epitome of clear
heels yeah you see same thing going for
your 6 pin supplemental power for the
graphics card just kind of standing out
there but of course all of that you
don't notice because the immediate thing
you look at is the yellow electrical
tape on that and the hard drive so maybe
that's the real point of it there is
it's a it's a making black tape and it's
to distract you you look at that and
then you don't notice the other
potential aesthetic shortcomings of the
PC the little flash bang um all right
Intel spot coolers not doing me do a
solid oh no not at all
I mean there's this there are many
aesthetic upgrades that can be made to
this PC but you know you gotta
appreciates mech cheese here just
pointed out that it works right I think
the first let me know what kind of case
it is antic I don't know it's just this
the case it's a case it's an ATX layout
it had a mount for my optical drive
scrounge together like two three hundred
dollars to get a new GPU and a new
cooler and I think it'll do you wonders
you don't like a pretty solid
you know CPU that's a quad core what's
it on gigs a memory oh yeah totally
bad Intel Core i5 4000 series is pretty
solid yeah they can definitely handle a
lot more GPU than that r9 if you
upgraded your GPU and any large or
substantial way though you might want to
consider a power supply upgrade too
which could fix your cabling issue so
yeah when you decide to drop some money
on the system there are a few hidden
place upgrades you could do that would
help you out what is the what's the
minimum power supply requirement for
a gtx 1660 TI i want to say it was 450
is a 450 maybe 500 worked hard even it
might even might have been 400 but I
mean yeah he's sort of the mid-range
Turing Jeep the the mid-range trained
GPU that Nvidia just launched might be a
good option for you actually EVGA s 1660
txt black requires a 500 watt power
supply well that's the XE black monster
power envelope is 120 watts I think you
would be fine honestly with a for 30
watt PSU at that card it might get you
yeah I mean if you especially because
you have a Core i5
you know block CPU yeah so someone
people are saying 400 450 for 400 to 450
yeah so you probably be safe but
definitely change that CPU cooler as
well because I agree thank you very much
Randy Randy Christian Christian Villegas
have like an atheist rnt 700 XG sealed
32 hundred megahertz memory who cares
how much it is it's fast
rx 580 sapphire graphic scary crosshair
7 hero motherboard 500 gigs m2 SSD and
stock power supply cables and alright I
will say and I dig the little good color
spider-man spider-man figurine yeah
accent there also it may be acting as a
GPU support I can't quite tell maybe but
if so good use of of that yeah well not
the the sort of doubling up here of the
plugs for the graphics card get some
extensions extensions might help I mean
this could also just be slightly read
there's a zip-tie on it you've done
something it's just not really working
for me it's good this could maybe be
cleaned up a little bit or extensions of
course well I think read extensions
would
so much for this yeah that would I got
30 bucks on like some cheap up here Asia
horse cables and they would look so good
inside this rig also I would say match
the back fan to the front one so get
another Corsair ml pro fan put it in the
back just to make it all matchy-matchy
and please rotate that bottom front
intake fan 90 degrees to the right 90
degrees clockwise so Corsair exterior
labels are uniform with the one at the
top I don't know why but it just it
drives me insane that's that's
reasonable it has nothing to do with
performance it's all just like it's just
maybe it's kind of that you know one
thing just unturned yeah but everything
else looks great it's it's real solid
color he blows nothing's clashing color
wise and uh diggin spider me and dust it
dust the shit out of it every dusty
thank you very much Christian good
hardware choice Abraham Abraham Lopez
Reginald oh it's his first PC build he's
looking to water cool this summer and
just in time for stuff for the hot
summer temps rise in 2700 horas gaming
seven msi gtx 1070 TI duke and cooling
master each 500 you know okay
again cables leaving could do you some
huge favors here these don't look bad
but they're not pretty
appreciate the email to pull pictures so
we can see from multiple angles man I
mean it was RGB so the cable management
I wouldn't say gets high marks it's not
bad
but again here we have kind of a daisy
chains power plugs for the for the
graphics card which I mean it's hard to
work with with this power supply this is
one of those EVGA power supplies that
has really thick sleeving
right at the end of the cables which is
very hard to manipulate and work with or
hide so yeah I like how said some
extensions there
could could printing things up a bit
other than that I mean everything's
looking pretty clean we have stock Amba
heat sink fan you said you're
considering upgrading that to a water
cooler that would be a reasonable
upgrade since you've already got a 2700
you can maybe get a little bit more
performance out of that it'll boost the
look of your system overall - definitely
would improve the look and with your RGB
lighting I don't know I feel like you've
got some may this is just a static
picture so it's hard to say for sure but
I want to see some more synchronization
of the RGB lights here yeah you probably
have multiple yeah you definitely have
multiple software's that you would have
to deal with do it do that since you've
got a Norris motherboard and a few other
different things yeah but you could you
could work on that yeah that's a bad
first attempt though yeah very nice
build especially for the first time and
again very nice choices for your
hardware they yeah thanks Abraham X we
have Gabriel with a Verizon 5 1600 X
horas AX 370 gaming 5 motherboard and a
PNY GTX 10-7 and a looks like he's got
some 82 X PG Ram as well okay let's look
looks like it's in a Corsair case red
and black theme going on here hmm cable
management is looking a little hairy I
think also because you don't you have an
older case that doesn't have a power
supply shroud yeah and so that power
supply is standing out power supply has
an ATI label on it if that tells you
anything about image right Ultra X 480
plus bronze I mean it's 80 plus bronze
rated and it's a 750 watt it's a
perfectly functional power supply it's
just not doing you any favors when it
comes to aesthetics especially in a case
where you can't hide it the chickens
bottomless Jergens balls right there cuz
you know you got you got a cavity the
prepared for any
he's also a guy you never know when
you're gonna have to moisturize
he's also got this down here is that a
wee bar of your body is that a boy
scouts where we looks like a weeble oh I
don't know much about Boy Scouts but I
was illegal oh wait below yeah
what does that mean it's this this
insignia on that thing done there though
right
wiebel am i Romero he's a boy scout with
a full bottle of Jurgen beer his Cub
Scouting PC his Cub Scouts was the
bullet okay yeah we've lost the old
Jergens we've see look at look okay look
at so what does that mean you I don't
know it's also something it's an
insignia I've seen in other places so
that might be he used to be why some
Beweave lordly weeaboo ones that are
weak
yeah but anyway so we're kidding we're
getting there stuck here I would say
getting uniformed fans in your system
would be great yeah get all the safe
that's some clear bands with red LEDs
all the same fans let's do pretty get
man yeah the fact that you have that
power supply it still has an NCI sticker
on it maybe if you get a new power
supply maybe you should get a new power
supply and custom sleeve cables for the
power supply just saying yeah or a new
case with extensions a new case an
extension oh yeah if you got a case with
a shroud and some extensions you could
still use that power of supply because
it's 750 watt 80 plus bronze parcel but
I mean it's still adequate so if you
have old transplant Hey all right cool
thank you sir Thanks last one here is
from Steve she ain't ugly but could use
a lift high seven seventy seven hundred
aces Z to 70s li+ motherboard to buy
eight gig ddr4 2400 kit XFX rx 580
graphics card GTS e xf x RX 518 GTS e d
8 gigabyte GPU that's a lot of words Oh
God
to 512gb SSD Zin one 1.5 terabyte
heart rate how do you have a 7700 but
that cooler on it what cooler is that
that's a it just slightly that's
interesting it looks like a really basic
stop cooler
it looks like a stock cooler when it
comes to the fin array but with a
different fans that's on top tilted
right and it's kind of off-kilter yes
that's that's very interesting it's a
really nice looking system but that that
CPU cooler just makes it look so much
cheaper are there 1.5 terabyte hard
drives is that a thing
yeah yes of course there are a series I
have one I'm so used to yeah I guess
there were five terabytes but oddly
enough there's no like two-and-a-half or
three now well because that was a little
last time they needed to cut a terabyte
down into a smaller chunk right you know
once they got to one terabyte and they
wanted to one terabyte to two terabytes
who wants two and a half you want two to
three or two to four right it's a
smaller eight that's how that's how one
and a half computer other day's work all
right so man interesting that there's
cable extensions like this is a pretty
nice sleeved extension kit that probably
costs way more than whatever this cooler
is all right so that's kind of
interesting
it does it does aesthetically all right
we're talking aesthetics it looks nice
he is not he does not have off-kilter
front intake fans when it comes to the
Corsair logos that are bothering you so
much before yeah so that's nice
you may love another day yeah I mean I
guess the CPU coolers bugging me a bit
because it's just seamers for an i7 no
yeah because it's an i7 because there's
so much other things in the system that
are premium and that cost a lot yeah
yeah it somebody saying maybe it is a
non K part like what's you know we're
just fine there it's probably there is a
potential reason to upgrade a cooler on
a non k part and that's just for a
better cooler that might be quieter
obviously you don't want to spend too
much money on something like that but
yeah I didn't like a $30.00 hyper 212
Black Edition that would look infinitely
better and it would be 30 bucks $22 for
the new egg deal that was on this week
$22 if you if you did the middle and
rebate
he's got a couple cans of dusts dusting
cans there those obviously no test
problems in this in the system all right
so what did what's what's our it's our
verdict here it's a nice build yeah they
gave a serpent of hardware the coolers
the biggest the cooler is just kind of
baffling to us but clean clean overall
look and well done I would say mmm-hmm
just need to figure out that cooler and
and and lastly we had sort of a special
feature here did I tweet it at you all
so you could check maybe your tweets I
don't know if that's possible when I
logged into Twitter you're logged in
could you log into yours
without people seeing you can I just see
what you tweet it was it serious
oh this so these are actually images
taken from our good friends and fellow
youtubers Brian from VPS customs oh and
Steve from gamers Nexus okay a tech
Jesus they're actually just doing each
other in China right now well they're on
a Coolermaster trip they're actually
exploring and touring some of the the
cool factories that coolermaster has out
there and they knew that we were doing
an episode of hit my PC today so they
figured they might as well send us some
shots of some of the other rigs that
they've seen on their trip so far I see
thanks those guys you should check them
out if you haven't yet that's real clean
but but yeah let's take a look at this
one really quick this is apparently a
USB testing system I think I think I
think you said it was like there's
testing USB devices what is this what is
that right there
it looks like it's plugged into the side
of the power supply oh whoa weird
what is that is weird why is that like
that yeah that looks like USB so they're
they're clearly they're clearly testing
USB stuff that's that's a testing power
supply that I guess we can't fault them
for because that's its that's its job
like I said they're making use of these
you know unused 3.5 inch base storage
you know for like a notepad and some
tape and this bag of miscellaneous
cables that's useful let's turn it into
cubbies yeah so Brian said it's a
testing machine for USB cables Oh
so it's literally just a PC they used to
test for cables there was no description
for this one that Steve sent over the
other one that's kind of darkly pictured
it's not the highest quality that's
that's my picture is there another one
no but you're supposed to oh okay
so I would say rebuild the whole system
yeah with just some sleeved cable
extensions all of the USB cables that
they're testing should it have to be
sleeved with sleeved USB cables okay the
fans there and that's where I'm coming
from
all right let's pin my PC and that's the
end of my half yay so we get to move on
to a quick a relatively brief after
party because we do have dinner
reservations yes we do I mean Paul and
wifey sauce um eight so yeah let's move
over to that all right yes sir watching
thanks guys anyone who wants to do
timestamps you de man here every what
day Tech has been doing them or woman
every day khakis awesome thank you you
are the shiznit thank you so much thank
you guys okay
be right back bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
