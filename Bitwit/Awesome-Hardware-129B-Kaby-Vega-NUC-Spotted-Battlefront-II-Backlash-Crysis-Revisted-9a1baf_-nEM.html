man Boop
I mean this is basically four beers
right here yeah for 5% meters like it's
slap you in the face
alright but hey REE live to YouTube now
as far as I know well then welcome
ladies and gentlemen to awesome hardware
episode 129 SOI big crab goes wild I'm
down everyone hold your applause till
the end thank you very much
this is a live show the pol and I do
everything keep your tapas on top come
on hey we're both married men movies huh
nice we love you um so this is a live
show the Paul and I do every single
Tuesday if I 3 p.m. Pacific time right
here on twitch.tv slash awesome harder
if you're on Twitch stay where you are
if you are watching this on YouTube
right now and it's the rebroadcast go
ahead and watch side a on Paul's channel
which is youtube.com slash Paul's
Hardware you can find the link in my
description below a bar Matt this is a
technique show where we talk about tech
news mostly and a bunch of other things
that you may or may not find interesting
occasionally we like to have an adult
beverage let's not kid ourselves not
occasionally all the time additionally
we tend to curse some types we use adult
language we have party mouths once in a
while so if you have children around be
sure to shoot them with love and just
keep them safe keep them safe keeping
pram keep them warm at night you know
yeah I was expecting heroin that is
really stable with heroin they won't
even know we're there but love is now
that's appropriate so yeah okay all
right all right
um let's let's plug ourselves nuttin
that sounds weird right let's plug our
stores I have a store called bit with
tech slash store you can visit it now
and buy all the things there including
the beware of a bottle next shirt I've
got bit with decals these are all
premium quality products that joke with
a guy who lives in Vermont
I mean it's high quality it is we
we don't even we don't even see the guy
really he's in a different state so it's
good stuff he's awesome he's super cool
John is the best he makes really high
quality stuff and the pricing is totally
worth it John if you're watching right
now does he watch live I don't know if
you watch his life but he definitely
sometimes catches the rebroadcast I've
been trying to respond to his email all
day John if you're watching right now I
agree with what Heather said in her
response to your email yes
so just greenlight that yeah yep
get the green light we've got basically
we've got mousepads coming guys
mouse pads that you will enjoy yeah but
in the meantime go ahead and buy stuff
from our stores poles Paul's hardware
net where he's got some new good stuff I
have a 15 ounce mug that provides you
with four more ounces than the previous
crappy
11 ounce mug hmm drink your hot cocoa
drink your cider drink your rum perhaps
an Irish Coffee it would be delicious in
there as well also awesome hardware
shirts buy them from either of our
stores the profits are split evenly
between us we're an equal opportunity
seller of goods weight sofas light a few
sales 15 ounce mug that is actually what
a hold on a 36% increase over your 11
ounce mug in terms of capacity if we
were to like you know I do go to a
special web site for that turn it out
because it's quicker Paul because can
you calculate that percentage in your
head faster than I can type in four
digits with a keypad no no but I can use
it but I can use the calculator app on
my computer to just you know math that's
dumb I have that site memorized by heart
okay
calculators are stupid I use that all
the time for benchmarks that website is
it's great 15 divided by 11 it's it's
the same reason why you wouldn't just do
it in your head Paul it's a calculator
specifically for that formula okay that
does it a lot quicker than if you were
to do it manually just like dividing two
numbers yes
yes actually it goes both ways it does
let's let's see trust me trust me it is
it is more accurate it's like you're
safe the accuracy is at least 500
percent greater all right the accurate
really come down to those decimal places
yes it matters okay okay we're not just
splitting hairs here okay all right
that's good
this high I math all the time okay my
name is a math expert that's why that's
why STEM education
I am so math that I took algebra twice
so I took it twice like Algebra one in
algebra - no no like I took algebra 2
twice alright that's how good I am
though that's how good I took like twice
the algebra - all right let's move on we
are short on time here we are slightly
well maybe because we started a little
bit late but that's ok 8 News News News
wait we forgot to plug the meet up oh
yeah oh yeah all right announcement
first off we have a fan meetup that's
taking place this Saturday yes suck its
rids gonna be terrible don't come don't
make any travel arrangements if you live
out of state yet not worth it Paul and I
definitely are not worth it
however if you're local in the LA where
did you happen in Rio sometime within
the next two to five days oh yeah it may
or may not be Saturday Kyle just said it
was Saturday but that could have just
been something to throw you off cuz
we're trying to be cryptic maybe it's a
maybe it's a mystery and who knows what
were we doing there definitely I have
had too much black Tuesday try to have a
poker face about this I've had way too
much black Tuesday to have a poker face
right now anyway you're local in
Southern California especially if you
came last year because we did a similar
small meetup last year
stay tuned watch our Twitter's for the
next next few days we'll give some more
details on that yeah we're gonna have a
little fan meetup so if you're able to
come
you would love to see it yep sometime
this weekend that's probably that safe
all right
that'll be fun uh all right let's talk
about some tech news starting off with
some leaked photos babe it no not of
Jennifer Lawrence I'm sorry but this is
of even equally stimulating Intel nook
has been spotted with a Katie Lake CPU
and a Vega GPU oh all the same industry
is that really from this I don't think
the most badass nook picture they might
have is pulled up the bet in the most
coolest NoCal from PC gamers - thank you
that's it this is following Intel's
announcement last week that it was
working on a multi chip design featuring
a core CPU one of their own with a
Radeon graphics chip integrated for
compact laptops but these leaked images
tell us that perhaps consumers will
benefit more from human enhance more
than just laptops with with this
interesting collaboration see when
enhance so maybe laptops aren't the only
where this collaboration ends hey this
is a leaked photo post by chip health
for max tempo sent on to chip he'll fit
maqsuum sir we can't zoom in any further
yeah there's no more enhancing reach the
limitation to Chrome we're using Chrome
maybe if we were using the new Firefox
quantum we can zoom in close to maybe
totally sweet superior and every week so
this is from Chappelle chose the GPU
might make it to small form small
form-factor desktops and all-in-one PCs
this is a CPU
yep that's a CPU and then we got the
ring on you yep so it's Vega
this is HBM and HBM memory right stacked
next to it and that beautiful so we've
got a custom Radeon graphics chip based
on AMD's vague architecture additionally
you can see that there's an end to slot
there with a populated 120 gig and via
major I've got some messes got some dual
dual channel Esso dims ddr4
is there any more information on that
not really and we also have I kind of
like the power delivery configuration
they got going here it looks fairly
substantial for you do you think CRM
yeah all the phases and you got all them
most player obviously counting phases is
not everything right but no it looks
pretty pretty nice doesn't look too
skimpy maybe maybe fun to overclock a
nuke over nuke you don't want to over
knock over inner kings yeah all right
yeah and then it looks like you've also
got a couple SATA six King ports for
additional storage no further
information was attached these are just
like LinkedIn for leaks photos we don't
even know if this is legitimate or if
it's faked whatever it looks pretty real
to me
but that's exciting I'm excited that I'm
not gonna have to buy a stupid laptop or
do or you want a stupid laptop in order
to test out this new technology that we
can potentially see this on other
devices other than notebooks and stuff I
like nukes
I think Knicks are cool nukes are useful
and portable there especially for
something like a living room setup or
something like that
something's workstation if you're a cord
cutter and you're getting rid of your
cable and you want something that you
can just set in your living rooms and
equity HDMI play some basic games on and
you know used for internet internet
access and streaming Netflix and
something like that
oh look makes a great solution for that
yeah absolutely so uh thanks Chappell
for the leaked photos that may or may
not be real and then we've also got an
article from ARS technica this is about
Qualcomm rejecting broad comms initial
105 billion dollar - hangover offer 105
billion dollars gets thrown on your
table and you're like ash yeah
hard pass this is uh this is heaven last
week Qualcomm statement today says the
deal significantly undervalues the
company CEO Steve Mull comprar says the
best of the best company with their
hands in mobile Internet of Things
automotive edge computing and networking
within the semiconductor industry and
they can
making their existing stockholders
happiest clams as they grow all of those
segments and lead the transition to 5g
it was like Luke it's like lukla
fruition spray Mullen cop cop see the
way I said it was scented way more
natural copper Molech
alright so Steve Molech coppers the
other day Steve mola cop from birth a
new private phone sorry crap phone
anyway I know it's not the pixel to XO
all right yes um they're unsure OCS
things just see and then they're unsure
well we're just unsure as as people if
or when I breve hated Broadcom as bc i
want to say british columbia of when
Broadcom will make a higher bid they
could they could counter it or they
could counter themselves and be like hey
we'll give you more than hundred five
billion dollars since that wasn't enough
but this you know this second offer
could hinge on Qualcomm resolving their
conflict with Apple that's been ongoing
for this year so this is like a
negotiation tactic then like perhaps
like yeah well come would be like we're
worth at least 200 billion and then
broad comes like hey I'll give you 105
and think we're worth more than that but
it's still like it hurts there and
feelings like that there you know
internally think maybe we're not worth
200 but it's a nice and on now maybe
they're willing to capitulate mm-hmm 150
maybe because that's why I thought like
usually if I'm bidding on like a
multinational technology company like
you often do crazy amounts of assets
yeah like that's that's what I would do
yeah you would you are the prime
authority on this matter but you know it
still depends on whether or not Qualcomm
can resolve conflicts or their issues
with Apple I feel like that could
determine how this whole deal with
with Broadcom plays out because right
now Apple I mean Apple usually uses its
own chips I feel like most mobile phones
use Qualcomm chips or SOC s but Apple
and Samsung make their own in-house
right so they never really deal with
Qualcomm all that much but Apple
recently put an Intel modem in some of
the the new iPhone models which you know
Intel modems are partnered with Qualcomm
and that triggered Qualcomm they got
uber triggered and they're like wait
wait we want some royalties mr. Apple
for all these iPhones you're selling I
mean they're seeing dollar signs right
there's a piece of there there's a piece
of their product inside of these new
iPhones probably the iPhone X or some
shit and and then Apple was like no well
no no we're gonna sue you and so Apple
sued Qualcomm now there's a stupid
lawsuit and it seems like that resolving
these issues with Apple would strengthen
Qualcomm's position but at the same time
this has been so it's been ongoing for
so long now that it doesn't seem like
there's a resolution in sight that would
take place in time before any deal would
actually happen so it's uh doesn't seem
very likely that it'll happen anytime
soon
it's a quagmire it's a quagmire it's a
quote that's a quote quagmire way to
come Queeny yeah yes what you said so
yeah 105 billion dollars just doesn't
you know it's not it's not what it used
to be 105 million dollars isn't what it
used to I can imagine you must feel
pretty like satisfied with yourself
having made that decision being like
yeah I just turned down 105 billion
dollars that got some balls yes you're
worth like 500 billion they're playing
they're playing role they're playing in
a realm that most of us you know can
only sort of speculate about but but I
I'm impressed impressed with the balls
in deep balls all right next up this is
an article from hexxus is about a
security firm trying to trying to prove
that Apple's face ID technology that
they raved and ranted so much about in
their press conference a couple weeks
back is a bunch of bollocks and can be
fooled with a simple mask Alex what what
the firm has experience with the sort of
thing it's a Vietnamese firm I'm
guessing he's beaten dummies now that
it's relevant to the story in any way he
does look firm
he does look firm they prove that face
recognition wasn't an effective security
measure for laptops back in 2000 I like
I want to point out and their foot
neither of these dudes are wearing shoes
dude I gotta get a job in Vietnam not
the camera go to ignore the dude I'm
digging the with a grating the way they
roll I like that dress code I mean he's
got socks on but still very casual so
the okay so here's that it's challenging
difficult because it's three-dimensional
it doesn't just take an image it's it's
looking at the face from different
angles yeah determined depth and that
kind of thing right exactly so um but if
you make a 3d mask then you can kind of
replicate the 3d visual and potentially
trick the face idtech in to unlocking a
smartphone an iPhone and this is what I
was saying earlier is that this company
be CAV I don't have no idea it's bkav
bkav the cab the cab so has proved that
face recognition wasn't very effective
with laptops back in the day in 2008
they also understand how the AI of face
ID works and how to bypass it and that's
perhaps why they were able to beat face
ID when the folks over at wired could
not they tried that earlier I think this
month and and failed the mask itself and
you're probably wondering what kind of
masks they make to pull this off it was
crafted by combining 3d printing with
makeup and 2d images that were sort of
plastered onto it besides some special
processing on the cheeks and around the
face where there are large skin areas to
fool a eye a face ID which what's
interesting is that color doesn't seem
to be something that the algorithm picks
up because the most of the mask is white
so you could say that
face ID if it's anything at all is
definitely not racist so there's that
stands to reason and as that was a big
part of the the difference in how the
face ID worked was was looking in depth
and actual structure of the skin and
everything yeah we cheekbones are
certain like you know certain lines that
the face naturally creates that a
computer would more easily pick up than
an actual human eye I read a sari where
you finished with your own oh good I
read a critique of this which was in the
which was discussing the fact that when
you actually enroll in face ID kind of
like when you're enrolling your finger
on your like a fingerprint reader or
something like that it takes initial
readings pictures of your face from
different angles but as you go along and
unlock the phone more and more it
actually continue it updates it gets
more data as it unlocks your phone with
face ID over time this is something that
it does yes that's how it works and the
speculation was that if these guys were
using that were unlocking it over time
using the mask that they might have been
training it to recognize the mask rather
than the recognizes face hmm so that
might have been manipulating the out
whatever software however the sufferer
is designed to recognize the face facial
structure and everything in a way that
you wouldn't necessarily be doing it if
you weren't in the environment that he
is where he's using his own phone which
is set up to recognize his face and then
a mask that's he's using to represent
his face with right 3d structure on it
so so maybe what you're saying is
because of its algorithmic learning that
maybe if he had like spent say three
months using this phone and unlocking it
with his face that the phone would
eventually learn his face so well that
even the same mask might not be able to
unlock it as effectively because it's
over those three months as opposed to I
think they tested this within a week of
receiving the phone yeah so maybe he's
only unlocked that phone with his fate
his actual face like twice right so it
says hasn't learned very much about his
face so it hasn't learned very much
about his face and then he's you
to unlock the met unlock with the mask
which is using that to enhance its
algorithm of what it thinks his face
looks like it's training it incorrectly
so to speak yeah yeah yeah that makes
sense
but all the things all that said yeah I
mean when it comes to biometrics chances
are there's gonna be some way to get
around it at some point
yeah and Apple Apple is claiming that
cracking the face ID is a million to one
shot if you were to in regards to like
someone actually sharing enough of the
same facial patterns and and in
structure as you it'd be like a million
to one and they were saying that the
finger-touch ID is like fifty thousand
to one as far as like the variation in
fingerprints and stuff so they were
saying like face ID is way more secure
but obviously the conclusion here with
this Vietnamese firm is that the
fingerprint is the safer way to go
that's okay
take heed be warned all right moving on
to our next article here from exes once
again thank you very much Texas this is
about the HTC vive focus which is a
premium standalone VR headset that was
launched just this week this is at the
vive developer conference 2017 event in
China earlier today I should say that it
was announced not launched but HTC first
announced vive wave let's talk about
wave first wave is an open platform and
toolset that's optimized for VR
development for high-performance mobile
devices this is basically catered
towards developers if you're not a VR
developer you probably don't care too
much about vive wave but it does
integrate completely with buy focus
which is the premium stand-alone VR
headset that was also announced this is
released in China only initially may
come to the US will probably come to the
US eventually and it runs games and
applications built on the vive wave the
open platform so it's kind of like the
Google store or the Apple Store but it's
the vive Wave store where you basically
it's like it's like the steam of this
vive touch platform that makes sense
it's said to be the first of its kind
powerful enough to deliver
VR experiences without wires or external
tracking solutions that means no cables
coming from the HMD completely
untethered and there's no tracking
lighthouses there's no weird camera that
you've to put on your desk
it's a standalone headset you put the
headset in the backpack you go to China
and now you have VR functionality with
room scaling in China hmm nice
that's impressive very impressive it's
using the Qualcomm Snapdragon 853 chips
chipsets six degrees of freedom hmd with
world scale tracking high resolution
AMOLED display there was no resolution
announced three degrees of freedom
controllers a six degree of freedom
option to be determined and it should be
noted that this is not a simply an
untethered full-fat vibe it's not like
they just took the vibe and made it
untethered that's not at all the case
it's because this this device
specifically only integrates with
applications and games that are on the
vibe wave platform so what it's called
yeah the vibe wave platform so you know
I'm sure that there will be a lot of
games that are ported over from the
regular vive port store on - vive wave
but this is definitely going to be a
separate product entirely than than the
HTC vive no pricing or availability as
of yet what would you pay for something
like this I mean if you could get the
same exact experience as your HTC vive
that we pick both paid what 800 bucks
for on pre-order and it comes with
controllers you don't have to set up
lighthouses you could literally bring it
to a friend's house and pack it away as
if you were packing in like a gameboy
type of thing like that's how easy it is
I don't know what are people willing to
pay for VR on this level these days I
don't know sir all right so add to it I
have two answers one the price that I
feel like they could legitimately sell
this for right now as a product to to be
sold as a consumer product and I would
say
if they wanted it to move $1,000 if if
they but probably more like 1500 that's
depending on the they how powerful the
hardware inside is like obviously it's a
standalone headset it needs to have
something inside as far as processor
graphics goes how powerful is that what
kind of experience can it support um is
it are we talking about very simple line
drawn
you know 3d animations or something like
that are we talking about immersion and
we're talking about an augmented reality
situation where you're wearing that and
you're seeing through it because it's
got cameras or something like that it's
doing AR yeah questions as far as how it
works and what it's capable of yeah but
yeah I'd say a thousand to 1500 would be
what that's a lot more than I was
expecting
really well I'm but design cuz I'm
comparing this to the cost of VR right
now which is not only fifty four hundred
to eight hundred dollar glasses VR
headset setup which is what's the buy
what's the vibe right now six hundred
five or six yeah five or six it is like
four plus you need a computer that's
gonna cost at least probably a thousand
dollars in order to power it so I can
combine those together and it's a new
product and whatever yeah the shitty
thing is that people aren't people don't
see that they just see the product
they're like they just see the bottom
line of what the product costs not all
the external if we cost so that's why I
was saying I have two answers yes second
answer if they wanted to create a device
like this that they want to become
ubiquitous like something on the level
of a Playstation 4 or an Xbox or
something like that to where it's like
lots of people have this people are
developing games for it you know that
kind of thing they'd appreciate it yeah
five six hundred bucks this was what
they would need to price it at I think
six under an Ori get enough people who
are like yeah I want to buy that that's
something that like my kids really want
for Christmas or yeah exactly
I could see six hundred doing it it's a
new technology and I
think that grants it the premium cost
over like an Xbox one even a 4k whatever
console but yeah most people not saying
that I agree with it sir that I wouldn't
I'd be wouldn't be willing to pay more
for it but I think if they want to ship
it as and they want to compete in that
space 600 bucks for that thing you know
and it might be it might be way just not
possible right now we might have to wait
a couple years before VR tech can be
watered down to that price point but for
me like with what you need are in order
to create an immersive VR experience
when it comes to the frame rate that the
the actual goggles need to hit with the
displays in each eye the level of detail
you need for an immersive experience and
everything like I still I I feel like
it's at least two or three years off if
not further than that oh yeah to come up
with some sort of solution for this that
is truly Wireless that's not relying on
the game being rendered somewhere else
like it yeah you need a powerful gaming
system or something yes like a wireless
headset okay but everything's being
rendered over there and I'm on the
computer right like and then and then
it's just the wireless interface it
means right exactly the problem is first
it's like I need the whole computer on
my hand my head it's doing everything
exactly we need more time because also
what's that gonna mean for heat and
noise yeah what if you're playing a game
that okay yeah maybe it's got built-in
speaker doesn't even say if has built-in
speakers or whatever but let's say
you're playing a game even if you're
playing a game sometimes games get
ridiculously silent and you're in
especially like horror games right and
you're like you know creeping through a
hallway or something what happens if
there's like no in-game audio and
there's like a built-in fan and you're
hmd that's like you know like that's
gonna take you that's gonna defeat the
whole purpose of what VR is and being
immersed or if it's getting super hot to
the fact where it's already I don't know
I sweat a lot as just normally when I'm
playing like counter-strike I mean
imagine having that strapped to my head
I'm moving around room scaling and all
that and the actual hmd is getting hot
like there are so many other obstacles
to to overcome before this becomes just
a nice comfortable no-brainer piece of
tech
I feel there's a lot of challenges but
it's it's nice to see it heading in this
direction in the West and with and with
software that isn't really graphics
intensive they can do a lot I'm sure
with this completely untethered
individual head mounted display unit I
just wouldn't expect it to be giving the
type of gaming experience that people
might expect if you're comparing it to
you know a desktop title or something
like that I think that's my main
question is am I going to be able to
play like all the the triple-a titles
that are starting to get VR support like
doom fallout 4 are those games gonna be
supported on this headset because if it
is I am all for paying six I'd probably
pay seven hundred for it but if it's
gonna be like a watered down version of
what the vibe and riff currently
supports or offers then yeah we
definitely stop a while to go but those
are all articles for standard tech news
for today let's go ahead and move on to
mail time time real time we've got some
stuff we got some stuffs here um Paul
you can open up I'll open up a box these
are things that you guys have sent us
Paul's got lettuce T alright you open
that letter I'll open this box and we
shall reconvene shortly I need it okay
what where you going
this looks like it came from somewhere
far away no this is from this is from
ratio Ryan
our good friend Ryan has centered this
why does it look like he can't us from
Canada that's why yeah it's got French
on it the ratio sent us there sure does
a the princess sticker
he's a sticker God is what he is he also
has apparently a 3d Windsor now oh yes

there's a a posted inside this is keep
doing your thing Paul a thank you for it
I will keep doing my thing he also
included his phone number Thank You Lang
I don't call people on the phone anymore
it's just phone calls
nope he said I really hate Paul I really
think that your channel provides good
Harbor info is respects to all the
benchmarks also like watching your show
with Kyle I think the best part was when
you guys visited Taipei for Computex we
have done that multiple times we're
going back again this year oh yeah I
also understand that as a creator you
might get so much
like this area has made things easily
accessible yet so distant that's true
it's very true
if only can meet heroes like yourself
Kyle and Jay from js2 sense that seems
far-fetched now also call Kyle and
compare notes I'm sending him a letter -
do you have a letter from Perth
potential yes you should Joel no and uh
will you guys be doing a meet-and-greet
anytime soon Perth is if you're local in
our neck of the woods I'm probably in
the next week that's what we discussed
thank you so much for your letters yes
I'd like it this is from Edgar Edgar
Guzman hello Edgar Guzman I'm a freshman
at Wichita State University and Kansas
and pepping you letter because my
handwriting sucks in about a year ago I
got the idea to build my own computer I
decided to wait to build it until I
finished my first semester of college
that I could save up some monies and so
the parts would be kind of like
Christmas present to myself while
searching for information about building
a computer in choosing Parts I stumbled
upon your youtube channel I started
watching some of your videos and really
enjoy them I especially enjoy your build
blog videos because I think they're
extremely relaxing and entertaining to
watch the through your channel I found
other tech youtubers like Paul's
Hardware tasty sense that I also really
enjoy and have become extremely anxious
about building my first computer well
it's almost the end of my first semester
and I feel that I've done a decent job
of choosing parts I plan to build an
Intel building a verizon build and I was
wondering which one I should go with
attached or my parts list for each build
and I wanted to know which one you think
I would but I should build or any parts
that I should change I want to keep the
price around a thousand dollars and I've
already bought the rim if you don't want
to write me a letter as a response you
can just email me at Edgar's
thanks so much and keeping amazing on
YouTube Edgar Thank You Edgar for the
parts lists yes I will I will try I
can't promise you that I can get her
like I'm so straight pretend I don't
know if I can get around to actually
looking at these and giving the proper
response but I hope that it all goes
well and I'm so flattered that you found
my youtube channel and really fell in
love with it
and that it's been an inspiration to you
to building your first computer it was
honestly such a great moment for me as
well so good luck man thanks you read
that really fast I did at next letter is
from Josh D you know Josh G from
Gainesville Georgia Georgia and he
included a processor and with his
shipments you put on this F net CPU he's
a truck driver it
that's cool he's making a delivery to a
packaging company in Atlanta yeah saw
this dinosaur CPU just lying next to a
trailer all semester he'll what next to
a trailer yeah so there's a bunch of
pins on the bottom bottom there smashed
it's an Intel Pentium he included the
CPU world description it's an EM cell
Pentium MMX FB no 508 zero five zero
thirty-two hundred two hundred megahertz
frequency 66 66 66 megahertz bus speed
with the clock multiplier of three
that's pretty impressive and speedy and
it supports MMX instruction sets which
is pretty nice so this is an original
pentium processor like uh look at the
pegs
yes master oh come every single pin is
completely smashed so josh is like
requests for us hilarious is to sign
that and he included another let another
envelope with stamps sites and his
return address and he wants us to sign
it and send it back wait sure I think we
can do no problem Cal's gonna take a
picture of it first yep
cuz that surely is all smashed to hell
very fine I'm still a nice collector's
item Thank You Josh for sending this
over and again in largely because you
included the self-addressed return
envelope with stamps already applied I
think we'll have no problem giving this
a quick signature uh yeah nice cool this
is from this looks like is just from
Amazon Fulfillment so maybe there's a
letter inside oh wait you have anything
else I can open down looks like food oh
my gosh food oh wait there's all these
giving receipts in case we want to
return oh my gosh oh my god oh my god
this is this is more jerky gift whoever
says his thanks here Zoey send us food
oh my god

wife I probably like it but no this is
oh my the drinking game you got the
sweet the sweet jalapeno juice red
pepper and sriracha beef jerky which one
you want right Paul Paul has a slightly
lower spice tolerance than I do
let me clarify spice is fine
okay I like peppers I don't like no heat
tolerance no heat is fine - I don't like
peppers I don't like the taste of
peppers hmm it's fine something funny
that all peppers most peppers have

I'll try the sriracha open this
direction sriracha is made locally here
in Southern California anyway so alright
let's let's give a shot we gotta try one
on stream that's that's the rule if
someone sends you food on stream you try
a little bit of it here hey let's see
let's put this thank you mmm-hmm Cheers
oh yeah I taste the sriracha and then
it's gluten-free
what do you know oh my god damn meat
snacks tasty all the meat snacks alright

I value the artwork way more than the
beer it'll get me wrong old super cool
but when the beer is drunk and weak so
are we the artwork will be appreciated
even more it sounded like you're gonna
run and I felt like you were about to
rhyme right those oh she's about to riot
we just all about to ride we share was
that on top of pain oh my god this is so
long Joel thank you okay so basically it
says alright I'll read the first part
yeah what's up if it's not too much
trouble I like to ask for some help I'm
an architecture student looking to build
a PC so I can render images and
animations at home most intensive
program I'll be using is called lumion
Lumias what it requires things give me
some system specs I'm looking for a PC
build that'll be able to run the
recommended system requirements I
already have a hard drive they'll be
using I'll be trying to keep the cost
down so I'm not looking for anything
that isn't necessary all most likely go
upgrading and adding parts in the future
I'd greatly appreciate the help thank
you very much
Joel I again same with with the last guy
I will try my best to get around to it
but I can't guarantee that I'll have
time to to reply to all of these I get
these on a daily basis believe it or not
and it is really difficult when I've got
a bunch of other stuff to tend to for
the channel but I hope that it works out
for you honestly I think the will see
the graphics card that he has picked
doubt oh I see those are the minimums
yeah just Joel just to give you a
response right now it seems like the
requirements for this software very
specifically indicate a four gigahertz
or higher frequency now frequency is
very relative to actual performance
single core performance and that kind of
thing
but I would say a rise in CPU might be
something that would be a good solution
for you especially one of the higher
higher and once it's clocked a little
bit faster like a 1600 X or 1700 X pair
that with one of the higher-end graphics
cards that they're recommending like a
GTX 1080 it seemed like you'd have a
pretty good solution for you that would
have a little bit more compute power
than something like the 4790k or 6700 K
yeah while still getting you the
performance that you want and if you're
willing to stick around I was planning
to do a thousand-dollar PC build for the
month of November I think that might be
what I'm doing for PC of the month so
you might want to stay tuned for that
before you buy any parts cuz maybe it'll
be ready but thank you very much for the
letter nonetheless and then the last
thing that we have this is actually from
my father-in-law this is from wifey
sauces father but you already opened it
the hell go ahead
oh my god Wow
yeah this is an old hard drive yes it is
Kyle I hope you can fit this eight inch
floppy drive a floppy drive into your
next computer built with 166 kilobytes
or kilobits floppy retail on this baby
back in the 80s was about $1,000
thousand dollars that's a bargain P yes
this is a PS the hard drive is 30
megabytes
that's Wow what is the interface on this
thing look at the connection point look
there's a mold bollocks is there's a
molex plug we could probably power this
guy like that but we'd have no way to
get data off of it this is like so this
like predates is a I don't know I did
not know what what kind of connection
interface that that is right there very
it's like a larger and fatter connection
than like the the part of Nintendo
cartridge do with actual the console
console yeah what I really wanted what I
like about this huh look at the belt
drive right there though I know freaking
insane it rolls there's a pelvis that
goes down unto the J looks again oh you
need to lubricate this thing dude oil
change on your own I'm it
that's or not 4:09 but this can eject
yeah I think so is incredible I feel
like this is a TV show where they made
oversized props for ya that is larger
than five and a quarter that is own what
what what size is that Hayden no you say
8-inch floppy floppy with 166 kilobytes
my god Wow but hey so alright alright
here's my question obviously this this
is from I don't know what year this is
from 80s this is gonna be some the
eighties eighties
yeah okay black front look at the blood
look at the front panel here I know all
black know RGB then they with the beige
I can't believe there's like ladies
night
suddenly they're like everything should
be beige up here let's make it this
horrendous tan color that gets easily
discolored everything they were Bachelet
they had they had it they had it right
here I think with this floppy drive me
amazing I'm impressed
Wow be appreciative that you live in the
air you do where we can get 2 terabytes
of storage on a stick of gum
quite literally not literally but
figuratively holy crap this is I don't
know it's like I don't know what I'm
gonna do with this now but thank you
I love the rodney discs thank you but I
was used to little floppy discs
just because I knew I could put big rant
the finger in the front and then you
could spin the disc inside oh yeah
take a first spin a little bit slowly I
can't believe that whole module is just
there to read the floppy I am I'm
literally flabbergasted Maxwell or max L
sorry it's a Mexican accent oh yeah
in Japan I would have loved to see the
computer that this went into yeah
awesome thank you wifey dad for that
amazing mail time moment that was pretty
amazing yeah thank you so much all right
let's cut right down to you another
segment yeah yeah let's let's do
somebody's report what will blow through
these these are really quick though this
is actually following up with the e a
story that Paul was talking about in his
half where ei had this whole debacle
with with Battlefront 2 where the
unlockable characters were costing up to
60,000 credits which would equate to one
redditor calculated 40 hours of play
time to actually get these characters
that's without spending any of those
credits on loot loot boxes loot crate's
or anything else in the game you'd have
to spend 48 hours something like these
characters or you could just buy the
characters with money but that means
especially if these characters can grant
you additional specs or performance of
the game and give you an
edge a competitive edge that means that
it's in a way a lot of people were
complaining that this was a pay2win
feature or it's just completely absurd
for someone to spend that much time on
unlocking these characters when somebody
who has the means could just right out
by them and have an edge in the
multiplayer game so after the weekend
outcry where EA racked up the highest
the most downvoted post in reddit
history with over 600,000 down votes 666
thousand he has know what it's up to now
probably close to 700 K out imagine at
this point EA has actually released a
public blog stating that it has reduced
the number of credits required to unlock
the most popular characters Luke
Skywalker and Darth Vader by 75% going
from 60,000 credits to 15,000 credits
that's a significant drop down in order
for every player to be able to acquire
these special characters to supplement
that from what I read at the same time
they also reduced the rewards for the
daily events that you do in order to
earn those credits from 20,000 to 5,000
ah so really so like let's more like
maybe there goes it bites the cost of
what you said or the cost of what you're
trying to earn credits to get ya is
reduced 75% but the amount you're
earning is also reduced 75% and result
is the same would you like some more
beer no okay
you do have to drive home yes so guys
leave your comments in the chat about
that but we'll be keeping a close eye on
that situation how it plays out as for
now also they turned off the refund
button they turned off the refund button
those bastards you have to call now
there is there's enough yeah they were
they were getting refunds it's such a
such a rate that they just were sable
dit remove the
yeah from their UI so you weren't able
to do that and you had to actually go
and call them and apparently the wait
times are pretty grandis that's bullshit
though yeah if you're gonna create a
refund button leave the refund button
don't take it away just people are using
it yeah stupid
EA sucks they're the worst alright
moving on to we were talking last in
your half of the show Paul about net I'm
sorry Lord of the Rings potentially
getting its own TV series yes we were
we're sure you see all these like really
big pop-culture franchises and stuff
getting their own TV series now we're
talking about hitman getting its own TV
series on Hulu there's an article from
PC gamer thank you very much hitman
studio IO Interactive recently pulled
away from its publisher Square Enix and
when indeed they went they went rogue so
to speak and since then agent 47 may now
be getting its own TV show on the very
popular streaming platform Fox 21 and
Hulu are partnering up to launch a
hitman series where the pilot script
written by Derek Kolstad who is the
creator and writer of the John wick
films like the John wick films I like to
the first one I only saw the first one
and I thought it was entertaining mm-hm
it was entertaining it was uh it was it
was it was one of those movies like so
ridiculous that it becomes fun so yes I
think that there's potential here
Kolstad will be the executive producer
alongside film producers chuck gordon
and adrian askary yeah who worked on
both of the hitman movies which I'm not
so hot about because both of the hitman
movies were kind of garbage
those appeared in 27 I'm sorry 20 2007
and 2015 you watch them they were both
kind of flops
I watched the 2015 no I'm sorry i watch
the 20 2007 one and I don't think I saw
the 2015 one but I never heard anything
about it so I certainly didn't probably
sucked the hope is for this series to
not suck and I don't know I'm always
skeptical when video games or even books
get turned into movies video well write
books I don't have the best track record
for porting over let's have a better
track record but yeah yeah video games
video games movies have a very very very
very poor tractors
but but that goes back to like the 90s
when they were trying to do it for you
know really crappy I mean look at the
original Super Mario Brothers movie like
I like that movie you you liked it well
cuz I saw when I was a kid we got acid
probably I was probably just a kid on
acid okay that was there those
accordions no but I totally feel you
it's it's hit or miss and most of the
time I would say it's miss so I don't
have a who's we're not wifey and I are
not subscribed to Hulu so I guess we're
not looking forward to it either way hmm
but I somehow doubt that it'll be the
series that gets me to sign it for Hulu
put it that way
well good luck to them nonetheless I
look I'd love them to prove me wrong
hey if it turns out too sudden somehow
be like some amazing series then and I
will either more cool stuff for people
to watch yeah absolutely
maybe um alright next article is also
from PC gamer this is about Call of Duty
World War 2 accidentally granting double
xp since its launch
oh how how could something like this be
so overlooked didn't someone play it
once before it launched and was like hey
I'm getting double xp multipliers aho
but wouldn't you okay anyway the latest
installment of the Call of Duty
franchise accidentally accidentally
launched with double xp enabled and
developer or developer sledgehammer is
at a developer they kept referring
referencing sledgehammer ed that's gotta
be the developer I cranked it up to 3 XP
late Thursday night just to keep the
ball rolling which ended Monday but 2 XP
double xp has been extended to Tuesday
which is today before finally landing at
its original one XP which is what it was
supposed to be launching with since it
launched and they're gonna modify this
back to what it's supposed to be and
suddenly that's gonna suck because like
this girl so hard now take so long well
that's what people are lamenting about
already gamers already complaining that
on reddit again
aggression the game progression is
already slowing to a grind and it'll get
even slower after this little XP boost
finally ends so the only thing I have to
say here is maybe Call of Duty players
just need to rage rage vent enough
online to get the Call of Duty
developers to to make it 3 XP forever
and isn't that the answer to all of
life's problems
it worked for battlefront to rage vent
online rage event online hash tag profit
and then profit that's what I do every
day all day earner
alright now in our final article here's
from Tom's Hardware this is a very
interesting article and it made its
rounds on multiple websites but this is
about crisis the original Crysis being
tested ten years later it's the 10-year
anniversary of the original Crysis it
started the meme it's the game that
started it all the can it run Crysis
mean 10 years later Tom's Hardware has
tested over a dozen flagship cards from
every recent generation from both AMD
and NVIDIA which were tested with a 7700
K it's funny cuz like 4k wasn't even a
thing yeah like crisis in 4k but right
but it's a PC game and even though it
was developed at a time when 4k was just
being still run to let rise you know it
can still run at that resolution it's
fantastic that's pretty cool
masterrace bitches um so what's
interesting here is that it's a long
article and you should read it yourself
because I'm not gonna paraphrase
everything for you baby but a conclusion
the conclusion is that crisis still
operates like a modern triple-a title
believe it at 10 a decade later with
only get this fall with only one GPU hmm
achieving over 60 FPS on average at 4k a
ten-year-old game which one today yeah I
believe wasn't easy yeah yes
high-end AMD and NVIDIA cards were
similarly bottlenecked in 1920 by 1080
somewhat expected though team green
enjoyed a 10% higher ceiling than the
radians this is unclear if it's due to
the CryEngine 2 engine or lack of driver
optimization since it's a ten-year-old
game or some other platformer constraint
at the other day NVIDIA GPU incremental
performance jumps over the years the
performance jumps over the years stay
consistent so every year - the Nvidia
progress and frame rates and stuff is
pretty linear but AMD occasionally saw
some really big performance spikes from
when they went to terascale 1 which was
the Radeon HD 3870 and 48-72 terascale 2
which is Radeon HD 5870 the terascale 3
Radeon HD 6970
there were also some nice gains with the
introduction of the new architectures
like GC n GC n demonstrated some
improved resource utilization and state
more stable performance going from voi W
based architecture to a scalar si MT
architecture also helped give some
really nice gains generation of
generation for AMD so it's a very
interesting article if you look at the
benchmarks it's pretty it's pretty
fascinating especially since it's it's
crisis and all that so go check it out
on Tom's Hardware yes yes
I wish it's such a cool article that I
wish I had thought of it first put that
um let's move on to Q&amp;amp;A or not Q&amp;amp;A but
Johnson's and QA and donations donations
and we'll finish off with Johnson's
let's see where's if no chance start off
sistene girl like the worst the worst I
know we sold nothing we're terrible
salesman it's just fine I'm often
surprised I'm like wow people bought
stuff and then you know today hmm
people are saving for Thanksgiving the
art for turkeys and stuff so I
priorities baby
alright so dingo on my $45 you guys made
me you know you guys made me to build a
rising machine should rise in seven
seventeen hundred x2 you buy eight
thirty two hundred speed or rise in
seven eighteen hundred x2 gig by thirty
thirteen hundred speed asus crosshair
six I would say oh it says
it's left over oh let's go from Alton
all right Jenna but finished a goodish
can go first Dean go I would say go with
the I mean honestly if money's on
Michigan at the 1800 X and 3000k by cuz
you'll you'll get a little bit more
you're gonna bump there I'll say get the
1800 X for a lot closer to the same
price as 1700 X if you keep your eye out
these days yeah like you should be able
to get it for 30 40 bucks more yeah
reasonably yeah yeah and 3,000 still
really really good speed to operate on
Rison but this is for my half Jake 3d
$10 Thank You Jake for your donation
mine ass is basically done but my old
case is so bad and missing a side panel
I wanted to put a rack back case but
couldn't find a cheap used one that will
hold all my drives I'm sorry Jake it's a
second story it makes me sad you didn't
actually ask us for any suggestions just
kind of relying like hey why I drew
Asian I appreciate that and Jake you
know I feel for you I really do hope it
works out man
Arlen Aaron are Aaron Aaron Barlow $5
none of those things you said now we're
trying to combine both words it didn't
work $5.00 cheers again choose to use
Cheers
Ramu Thank You Prince Jake 3d $5.00 have
either of you guys used a sous-vide
cooker I'm editing a review for one now
hard to edit and listen at the same time
lol I haven't used it but my wife has a
couple friends who've got them and who
likes swear by them and all we do now is
sous-vide stuff all the time yeah I mean
it's supposed to be a really cool fancy
way of cooking food you know cuz he food
in the plastic and they put that in the
water and then it makes water the right
temperature and cuz nothing about any of
this yeah it's a fancy way of because
you just pay people to make it for me
but yeah I haven't tried it myself I've
been mostly using the cast-iron skillets
to cook meat when required recently
skillets are nice
yeah skillets are the best but full of
warrior 7 $5.95 Paul what were you doing
at D and B to Dave and Buster's I'm
assuming I'm bartending between now and
grad school since my job market is
oversaturated and cheers to everyone in
service industry what were you doing
Dave and Buster's buffalo warrior thank
you cheers as well I would agree 100%
wholeheartedly with everyone in the
service industry it is a awesome
industry with lots of awesome people who
often don't get treated very well so
there you go I was ok so I worked the
front desk at David French - yes so the
role I was was front desk which was
there's there's someone at the front
desk and dave and buster's not the host
for the restaurant area but the front
desk is where you go to like rent if you
need to go to rent the snooker tables
that they have there what table snooker
what the hell's that
what's a snooker snooker is like
billiards but the tables a little bit
larger and the balls are a little bit
smaller and it's got four rules okay
okay but they have Buster's so yeah the
front desk you rent out those things and
certain areas like you help with with
large parties and stuff like that
my favorite time was I when I go there
I'm like a random just just a weekday
and all I my only job would be like to
turn all all the sports like I would
turn okay we'd have these all these
cable boxes and I'd like find all the
sports and put them on all the TVs going
in the and the lunch use all their power
yeah and like whatever the overhead TVs
and then like we'd have a random
trickling if people who come in for
lunch and I just be like chill in there
like very much like that's cool but yeah
front desk in the power station when
people will come in with their cards and
you'd like pay money yeah because you
know it's a it's a dissociation right
like if you're putting quarters into
something and like that's a quarter
every time that's a quote that's one
quarter of a dollar right yeah but if
you're like I have a power card and I'm
putting twenty dollars of credits onto
it it dissociates your your your
correlation between the actual value of
the money
and the credits that you're using to
play the games so you have money to
credits and then credits to the game and
like oh this game costs five credits in
like how much is a credit I don't know I
spent twenty dollars and I gotten X
number of credits and whatever yeah
that's the psychology of it or whatever
but yeah I would work the power station
and people bring their power cards and
put money on them would you get it would
you ever get anyone that was like super
pissed off about I don't know the games
are like yeah there's regulars as
regulars who come in and play games all
the time and spend ridiculous amounts of
money playing the games for the tickets
that they put on that card so they can
get the high ticket items because you
know they have a thing where you can
trade tickets for stuff like a place
crashes yeah or an Xbox is something I
know just right but it's like yeah you
spent $800 playing games so you could
buy a 250 dollar PlayStation you fucking
idiot like what's like I think David is
but Dave and Buster's they probably
think that maybe like they can they're
so good at the games that they can get
away with like spending a couple coins
and just raking in the tickets because
I'm sure like professional arcade gamers
can probably pull that off and actually
get a ps4 for way cheaper and what they
spent in games than actually paying for
it but most people probably can't like
99% of their cuz they're they're not the
games that you get tickets for like
there's arcade games that you just go
and you pay credits and you play and
that's all you get you don't get tickets
the only thing you should get tickets
for are the more like ambling games yeah
the key ball and stuff like that they're
games think you can't you're not gonna
be able to to take advantage of it that
well they've got some ridiculous games
now in the arcades where it's like
literally just about getting tickets and
like if you can hit if like you're tiny
if your reaction time is like on point
you can you know score out like a
thousand tickets or whatever off of a
couple quarters or something like that
which I get it if you're competitive in
that sense then maybe you can pull off
some ridiculous magic and get a ps4 for
under market value but I still think
it's a terrible weighted but most of the
klamath is a game
like that that can be taken advantage of
they they get rid of it because they
know the people's coalition and anyway
sorry thank you for that question
warriors zachary busters passed $5 got a
predator x34 nice and gave him a
girlfriend my old widescreen good call
she's finally using your pc 6600 came to
10/7 it's a nice computer for your
girlfriend for something other than
charging her phone that's yeah nice get
her to play some video games with you
it's a nice bonding experience she has a
very very nice system to do that she
should be very appreciative of you love
you every day all right
park mate $10 and 69 cents for more
black Tuesday hey when it comes to those
held against their will I doubt they
have trouble enjoying tonight's stream
cheers that's very very kind words Park
appreciate it it is and yes the black
Tuesday will go on this is probably the
last black Tuesday I'll ever need a
drink because holy crap its strong but
thank you very much nation the less Fred
rant $50 hey you had sick wifey sauce
get you food while you streamed a game
on Tuesday really when you should have
been taking care of her
where did you get the shirt in the
stream opening looks like from the 1950s
sounds like another pies in order
wow wow I've I feel so conflicted has
fifty dollar donation and this really
fifty bucks
rural common attached to it I feel
personally attacked for starters I want
to say just by comparison
Fred's donation from my half of the show
he had nothing to say which which I'm
gonna now take but it wasn't fifty
dollars was it was it I'm gonna take
this as a great compliment because
obviously I am flawless whereas keidel
has many problems that he's he's
struggling through right now so another
pie know is no sugar no more pie pie is
warrant at least 100 what is 150 it is
holiday season it 2-1 bitches which is
pie making time I've made one pie so far
this season and I will make more
it's kind of funny to me that you've
made a pie why just cuz I don't know
anyone who makes pies and you're like
not the first person I would think who
makes pies people have hobbies sometimes
their that's even funnier that's our
hobby I said I gotta like something that
I do on a regular basis it's like a
seasonal thing it's like oh it's just
all you're doing your spare time apple
picking we picked a bunch of apples what
the fuck am I gonna do with like 20
apples I'm not gonna eat them all no
you're right you're right I make them
into something that I mean I actually
eat which readily probably add a bunch
of sugar butter we're gonna make this
fruit is unhealthy as possible and then
it suddenly it's edible right no I I'm
sure it's delicious
honest sounds delicious
Oh Zizi a harder no wait no Fred ranch
no no holy crap
Oh Heather Hansen Heather its headache
yeah why vsauce five dollars hi honey I
don't want leftover pizza for dinner
speaking of dinner can we go to my
favorite restaurant this weekend love
wifey sauce sure why not we'll go to
your favorite restaurant what's her
favorite restaurant it is a upscale
vegan restaurant in LA and I feel like
every time we've gone there what we've
sealed
it's called crossroads and I will admit
it is the only vegan restaurant she's
ever taken me to where she had to tell
me it was a vegan restaurant okay every
other vegan restaurant she's taking me
to she didn't have to tell me it was a
vegan restaurant this is the only one
that I was fully convinced I will I will
it's like you and I it's like a high-end
vegetarian restaurant I'm gonna feed you
stuff and you're just like there's
nothing of value that they use there was
no suffering involved in this meal I
don't condone it
they only have a four rating and you
know yeah bullshit 1200 reviews the
impossible burger what is that that
looks awesome
it's it's it's a union Hattie okay it is
the most convincing patty I've ever had
all right it's pretty good like a very
simple very very fries but let's just
put it this way the last times I went
there I think we saw famous people I
don't remember the first one was the
first time we know the second time the
last time we went there I think I saw
Tobey Maguire he was just chilling there
I left the bathroom I saw and I was like
oh shit was he no he wasn't the
spider-man costume off but he was on the
ceiling who's just on the ceiling
somehow he was dressed like spider-man
who's just acting he's a really good
actor it's really good he was almost
feeling straight up in character the
whole time where no it's just somewhere
now it's whatever stupid la but I figure
out the play we never go there because
it's like downtown and Sox snifter spent
like 45 minutes to an hour and a half in
traffic to get there but it's delicious
it's really good moving on Oh Fred odium
I booked him I don't that is it's a
place by the Walt Disney Concert Hall
though even been there was another place
though that was vegan or something like
that that I'm trying anyway
all right away they're popping up
everywhere Fred Reines $5 do as she
asked or it's another pie yes sir
I know you got her me talking about I'm
supportive of it I'm down with it I'm
cool with it Oh another $5 donation from
the same Fred rant lied last week you
said you took her to dinner and you did
not you will pay wow this is getting
scary and it's getting second seems like
I know what you do and then another $5
donation from Fred you took off your
wedding ring that's a pie how is that a
pie why'd you take your wedding ring I
didn't take it off it's been on my
finger the whole time did you scrub them
i scrub through the stream people that I
think my wedding ring off I did not when
I put the house
and falsely when I put the ricer ring on
it was on another finger okay okay Jesus
is easier hearty are hearty 10
Australian thank you no comment thank
you sir thanks for not threatening me
like Fred Austin Gorski $5.00 beautiful
last name hey guys I love the show and
channels was wondering if somebody
wanted to send you products review
products to review is there a process
for that generally there is someone will
email us be like hey we just like to
channel this product it will either say
yes or no and at that point right kind
of how it goes or you won't respond
let's per tank kind of means no I mean I
have to say honestly and this sounds
like it like kind of it I feel I feel
like a douchebag when I say this but
douche but like 75% of the emails I get
about new products that I might cover I
don't respond to and it's not it's not
because I feel like I'm above that or
anything it's because I get too many
yeah I can't respond to all of them
yeah we're not aligned this operation
where we're putting it by a video out a
day we're putting out 8 - I'd say about
not more than 8 like 12 videos a month
which means we have to be pretty
selective with the content we create
yeah you know I mean we can't possibly
respond to all like all like 17 requests
that we get every week and say yes to
all of them and say yes to me maybe one
and we already have our own ideas and
and projects in mind that we want to do
that usually doesn't line up with any of
these these requests so but what are
they not but yeah probably you learn a
certain point that even even accepting
reviews of certain products is like yeah
it's not it's it you have to have a
certain use for a product you need to be
able to tell a story around it or make a
video around it that's interesting so
yeah
yeah that's fried that's the best answer
but there you go there you Thank You
Austin ba 3 mhb for the five knabe years
hey pollen Kyle I really enjoyed both
their channels team of the awesome work
I will try to tweet you a pic of my
first build please do you should lend us
your first station totally do that
we're excited thank you sir good luck
Scott until make six dollars to six
cents yeah Cheers cheers to you sir
toast
whoo JD ten dollars what race class and
spec would you guys be on vanilla Wow
vanilla Wow I have no idea I don't play
well so I have no idea what that is all
jumbled guide a little language that is
Paul though your nerd um all right so
top of my nerd top of my head I mean
hoard obviously but I would probably
just for a nostalgia sake go with the
same race class as I started with and
when I first started playing World of
Warcraft back in 2000
I think I was 2006 we rolled undead
warrior though it was what I started off
with son dude nice spec it's another
good question the thing you have to
consider with vanilla WoW is you don't a
dual spec anymore that was introduced
much later on so spec is much more
important like I mean I was a tank most
of the time but I was a tank fury I mean
I had dual spec tank and fury so I can
do DPS if I needed to but that's where I
met dick I guess if I had to make a
choice I'd probably go back to the tank
what a nerd
El Jefe reviews finals da la da will be
having an AMA on reddit tomorrow who's
watching probably not me
hey I mean they keep trying so I guess
you gotta give him that
I mean sure well I mean do you really
have to give him that if what they're
trying to do is really just put out a
fire that they've clusters fuck fuck
idli built themselves yes I would say
you have to give them that if what
you're giving them is that yes you're
acknowledging that they are doing what
they're doing because it is the truth
that that is what they're doing no you
don't have to give them that as and give
them that as in forgive them for
everything and be like yes yes well now
buy your game and spend lots of money
that's what I mean yeah I mean obviously
take whatever they have to say which are
much salt and try consider that they are
a large company and that profits are
their motivation and and they don't care
you know I mean there's evidence of the
past of large companies doing stuff
that's more in the general and the best
interest of the general population
because that gets so much positive
feedback and positivity generated back
towards the company that it does better
for them in the long run yeah so this is
what we would hopefully expect EA might
be considering doing is making decisions
that are less about making EA the most
money possible and more about giving
more a little bit more back to the
community but another big question and
another big just sort of general
analysis of their their actions and the
actions of a lot of other triple-a
titles is they're doing this because
they push as far as they possibly can
when a new title launches we're gonna do
this and this and this and this and this
and everyone's like oh holy crap that
shitty like wow you're making awful
decisions that everyone hates and
they're like okay we'll just do this and
then it was like alright well that's
okay
but okay just doing this was a good ten
twenty percent beyond what people would
have accepted before before they were
presented with this this this specter of
the horrible stuff that they're doing
like right it's it's like yeah push
really far so that the rollback is
is a little bit beyond what you would
initially would have wanted so it's
almost like negotiation yeah it's a
negotiation tactic or something like
that so yeah that's something to
seriously take into consideration as
well mm-hmm so whatever they're doing
tomorrow whatever yay is coming back
with tomorrow just consider what you
would have considered reasonable before
all of the hub of over the past 24 to 48
hours with with what they're doing right
yeah MD 60 several the $25 donation Kyle
I'm old enough to remember having those
8-inch floppy disks I just door myself
written computer programs back in the
late 70s good time seeing that hardware
again you're way more than awesome that
is oh gee man that is more than I can
say holy crap I feel like I just need to
mount this and like all the hardware
that my father won lost I mean like on
the wall back here that's just too epic
that's really cool it's so cool I never
I've never even seen a floppy used in
person have let alone seen one so I've
never seen right so five and a quarter
did you ever use yes a quarter which
ones you okay yeah I have the more heart
the harder ones that were that plastic
II know they weren't plastic no oh
you're thinking of three points oh I'm
singing at 3.5 no I five and a quarter
was exactly like this just if it's a
little bit smaller I've never used if I
have a recorder even okay yeah yeah this
is wooden plumbing English lapiz this is
the larger more floppy is this the
largest they ever got lighter I don't
know whether flippy spiritum I mean if
you go really old they had some large
size equipment that they used yeah I'm
not sure
so this predates me and people are now
clip twitch twitch clipping my ring
removal so apparently I did remove my
wedding ring at some point during the
stream which I'm sure Fred rant has some
other donation attached well we'll get
to that
hold on hold on all right John broad
five-dollar Canadian
do you guys have any info on
custom Vega cards I want something to
use my free seek monitors on but I don't
want a blogger style cooler in my case
honestly if you're trying to go freesync
then try to get a Vega 56 rx baby 56 is
now according to last week when I think
probably did a brief mentioned this on
your half that you can actually get a
bigot 56 for almost MSRP yeah like the
prices the prices are coming down it's
finally subsiding at least for the time
being so you might want to invest in
something like that depending on what
kind of performance you're trying to
drive if you're really trying to do
1080p trying to get 60fps then RX 580
would be sufficient I would think if
you're looking at the whole package of a
free sync monitor and a graphics card
then a Vega 56 at MSRP plus a free sync
monitor compared to something like say a
1070 and a g-sync monitor does make a
lot of sense a huge price cut there
you'll be saving lots of money thank you
very much for your donation Eric you $5
hello I am doing an experiment and I
want to do a two-way SLI or 3-way SLI
what would you recommend nothing to
overkill of course Eric you want to go
to way SLI simply because support for
three-way and four-way has gone out the
window and Vidya has stated pretty
clearly that they're only supporting
two-way the only things that see
benefits from three-way and ice a lot
three-way and four-way SLI are gonna be
just a very few synthetic benchmarks
that are designed simply for
benchmarking you're not going to see
support on the driver side for the games
that you want to play so you won't see
benefit from that and only reason to do
it would be for benchmarking purposes or
like really high-end drool-worthy PC
build purposes but nothing practical and
I personally wouldn't two-way SLI
anything less than GT x 1080 ya 1080
1080 TI even I would say I would say I
would say upgrade to a single 1080 TI
before you go to wait n 80s
I mean I mean there's an argue depending
on yet depending on the games you're
playing and stuff and how well they
scale with us alive but yes I agree with
Paul that at the end of the day you
should always up for one stronger GPU
than two lesser in sli or crossfire but
moving on to Fred rent $5 PI not up to
you it's up to wifey sauce and I oh I
will
Fred make sure make damn sure the wifey
sauce does not ever throw a pie in my
face again without me knowing beforehand
Fred with another $5 donation pointing
out you really did take out the ring kal
just for a few minutes but you did okay
maybe I did and then clip and wifey
sauce even noticed as you mentioned what
do you evidence how much do you really
expect for me to remember at this point
with the black Tuesday blame it on the
beer let's be honest this is black out
Tuesday we're talking really any school
it's impressive
you're shocked right now you clearly do
not know what we're dealing with in this
situation I mostly only take off my
wedding ring when I am about to use
going to Vegas use lotion Oh usually on
my wife for Vegas lotion not because you
don't want the ring there gets all goopy
and stuff like that nice see Chris
Wesley $5 donation love you guys you're
awesome Chris Rock Leslie we love you
and you are awesome thanks sir about
that how about we take that little
compliment and Shepherd right back in
your face sick burn
sick burn Fred Fred without dollar bucks
I would start to be nice to you if you
ever started to behave my god lol guess
you'll never be nice right Freddie
really likes to throw his weight around
what the hell with the money and maybe
maybe I can just continue being a dick
so he keeps throwing me $5 donations
maybe that's his goal the whole time is
to get you to be a dick some weird
experiment that you're pulling on me
right now
I don't know what kind of sense that
makes dr. daystrom dance your photos
what is your favor
type of tea both you I like boba milk
tea both let's use delicious I don't
really drink tea
I don't drink like actually green tea
black tea not by itself I don't like hot
drinks I like cold drinks I'm hot
blooded I like my milk teas and and
pretty I'll drink some like green tea or
the standard tea that they'll give you
it like a Chinese restaurant oh yeah but
I know I don't typically go out and get
tea myself yeah
I'm a cop I'm more of a coffee drinker I
guess yeah Jake 3d though five dollars
is everyone so salty because we have to
take so much news with a can of salt or
a grain of salt it's one of those
figures of speech that has sort of
become so ingrained in people that
everyone needs to have a grain of salt
in green and rain get it
ingrained oh this is the best show ever
it is no other texture ha ha no texture
comparison thank you very much Jake nori
Rivera $5 in video gtx 1070 TI $450 vs
Vegas 64 460 dollars which and why hmm I
honestly if you have a monitor yet you
can really get a Vegas 64 for 460 if you
can really get it for that price I
haven't go with that because you can get
a free sick boner for way cheaper yeah
it's really lovely the precinct honestly
the freesync g-sync question is is the
is is at the core of that yeah that's
the tiebreaker if you're not taking that
into the into consideration then
probably the 1070 TI will be your better
option yeah a bit more power-efficient I
mean I could ask what I mean that's a
cheap Vegas 64 so yeah yeah Freddie with
another $5 actual Q for once you going
to test the lick metal on a GPU let me
put the metal on GPU um I do not did not
have any immediate plans to do that I
don't think it would be a terrible
content piece that's something that
leave Mike
oh okay maybe sure potentially
differently ready in it I like I like
the better when you're making threats to
me Definity Raylan $5 the tactic you
mentioned EA is using is called Overton
Window it's nice to have a name for that
the Overton Window also known as the
window of discourse is the range of
ideas tolerated in public discourse the
term is derived from its originator
Joseph P Overton former vice-president
of the mechanics Center for Public
Policy who in his described in his
description of his window claimed that I
and ideas political viability depends
mainly on whether it falls within the
window rather than on politicians
individual preferences anyway there's a
Wikipedia article on this that describes
it a bit more in detail and we now know
exactly what it's called thank you
definitely real in the shape the more a
tactic I refer to that as is shadiness
yeah that seems to have worked for me so
far manipulating the publication and
that is all we have for today so before
we do at which rate um let's go ahead
and quickly do some Johnson's shout outs
for anyone who's about anything from I
lose I only got one I mark and Stephen I
