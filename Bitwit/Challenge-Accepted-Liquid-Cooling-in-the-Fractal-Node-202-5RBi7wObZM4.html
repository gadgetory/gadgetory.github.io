channel today is pretty interesting
because I'm going to be running an
experiment that I have honestly no clue
how it's going to turn out it could be a
success or failure or I could end up
frying my entire computer here what I'm
essentially going to do so this is the
the go anywhere do anything PC that I
built a few weeks back strictly for the
purpose of on location events this is a
portable system as you can see and the
one gripe I had with it was that there's
really limited space in the node 202
this case for a substantial cooler and I
have a 6700 K in here but as you can see
I've got this little dinky knock to a
fan well it's really quiet doesn't
really have the thermal capacity to
actually do any overclocking on that
chip so it's kind of a waste to have a
case cube processor in there however
that brings us to today's experiment
which is can you fit a 120 millimeter
liquid AIO inside of a node - OH - I
have no idea I looked it up online I
didn't really find much of anything I
saw some people installing radiators in
the node 202 but not like a full loop
I'm sure there's someone out there who's
done it and I probably just missed it as
far as I know I don't know if it's
possible I haven't seen the proof for
myself so this is a new adventure for me
but I'm feeling pretty optimistic I have
kind of tried to like Mach fit the the
radiator here so if you can see here I
actually removed the be quiet fan that
used to be here
I had it mounted as an intake right
there so I popped that out to make room
for this hero radiator and by the way
the cooler that I'm going to try to be
fitting in here today is the Zalman lq
310 and it's not really a popular cooler
I don't even know if it's in production
anymore probably not this is a pretty
old cooler um however I just had it
lying around and it's got a really thin
relatively thin radiator I think it's
only like it's probably 25 millimetres
27 millimeters thick so runs on the thin
side and the the tubing seems flexible
enough to possibly work work around the
edges of this case but we'll see we'll
see so as you can see here the radiator
fits fine the issue that that I'm having
right now is trying to fit the tubing
through
through this little opening it's kind of
hard to see but in the note 202 there's
really this tiny opening that the
waterblock will not fit through that
this cutout is really just for routing
cables anything thicker than a few
cables is not going to fit through here
and this I don't want to like cut into
this steel technically I could just cut
this steel out if I really wanted to but
that might ruin the structural integrity
of the case a little bit I should also
mention I should have probably pointed
this out from the get-go but you might
notice you might have noticed that the
little SSD cage has been completely
removed now I had the SSD that's still
mounted in here and I'm going to need to
find another place to mount that because
this isn't going to work the only reason
this radiator can fit here at all is
because I've removed this SSD cage so
I'm going to just need to find another
place where this SSD I'm thinking just
right next to the power supply I mean I
could just velcro it down it doesn't
really matter I'm not too concerned
about the SSD here it's going to be fine
there's no moving parts so I'm not
worried about that so yeah that's going
to have to go I'm either going to have
to cut this piece of metal out here so I
can have some room for the tubing or the
other option guys the other option here
and this is probably what I'm going to
try to do is take apart the water block
of this AIO
and remove the hoses just disconnect the
tubes just so I can route them through
this little square here and then
reconnect everything on the other side
so that I can then proceed to mounting
the water block and voila hopefully
everything will go smoothly
but that's going to be our first step
guys is to crack this thing open
hopefully not damage it in the process
and try to get these tubes removed so
why don't we go to a place that the
bathroom let's go to the bathroom
we're ready to do this we're ready to do
this there's the power button it has a
power button okay ready I love you if
anything happens to you just know that
oh oh geez is it even working I don't
think it's working guys guys I don't
hear a pump I don't hear water yet oh
boy okay
so it looks like I'm gonna have to crack
this thing open again and take a look at
the pump this time it's got to do the
pump okay I'm going to power this down
we're going to take this back in crack
it back open and then with a try to mess
around some stuff and I don't know it's
not looking that great at this point
guys but hopefully our look and turn
around somehow well we'll figure it out
or not
alright guys so it's been about 10-15
minutes and it looks like there is not a
single drop of any kind of fluid on this
paper towel here so that means our leak
test at least for now has tentatively
passed and now we can go ahead and move
on to installing this thing proper and
as far as like fan choice I mean I don't
know if I can get away with a 25
millimeter just a standard fan I might
I'm gonna try I'm going to try to with
the I think this is a coolermaster came
from a neptune 120 XL but that radiator
was too fat to fit in here if that
doesn't work I do have a slim side
slipstream fan that's a 15 millimeters
thick this guy right here which
obviously is not going to perform quite
as well as a full full-size 120 fan but
it's better than nothing if if it gets
the job done so let's let's go ahead and
do this
alright y'all here she is
look at that actually a beauty so yeah I
got the CPU block on there alright you
can see I kind of tied down one of the
tubes here kept it from sticking up too
far the radiator or I'm sorry the fan
that I went with ended up being that
Coolermaster one anyway the one from the
Neptune 120 XL it is a regular full-size
25 millimeter thick fan you can see I
just barely made clearance with the PCI
Express cable probably like a millimeter
it's actually pushing it up but it's not
quite enough to cause any kind of
torsion on the PCIe slot so that's good
the radiator as well I don't know if I
had already mentioned that but the
radiator just fits so perfectly but I'm
just barely made it of course I did have
to as I mentioned had to remove the the
entire little drive cage here in order
to fit the rest of the radiator so you
can see I've got the my SSD I have a
second SSD in the system but it's m2
it's in the back of the motherboard so
this is my only real two and a half inch
drive here thank God for that
and honestly it looks kind of shitty
right here just because it's sticking up
or whatever but it is it's it's not
going anywhere let's let's go ahead and
see what happens when we power this guy
on oh I'll buy here noises I here's a
pump I hate it as a pump Ã¤j-- it sounds
pretty normal and we have a boot we have
a boot there's a closer look at the pump
doing its thing it actually sounds
perfectly healthy and we need to check
temps we need to check temps because
that's this is all for nothing if the
thermals aren't there all right max temp
on the 700 K we got 68 degrees Celsius
alright well below 70 now that's that's
very nice because uh this is overclocked
again 240 400 megahertz and if you guys
remember from the last video or the
testing video where I tested this with
the Noctua air cooler I don't know why
I'm turning this down the temperatures
were actually in like the high or like
the mid 80s I was getting like 83
degrees
Elsie's with the 6700 K the same chip
with turbo boost disables oh no
overclock and we disabled turbo boost
and we were still getting 83 degrees
Celsius and now here we are at 4,400
megahertz
chillin at 68 degrees so that is quite
an improvement overall I would call this
project a success this experiment has
passed guys guys guys guys guys guys
girls I have just made a very
unfortunate discovery after we ran our
little test there I power the system off
and just for shits and giggles s ting
and we got air bubbles turns out I
didn't fill the loop all the way 100%
with water and that's just by design
like I said these aerial coolers are not
meant to be opened or refilled in any
way that's just not how they're that's
not how they work and unfortunately I
was unable to to refill it properly so I
was getting some really bad you know
whining noise from the pump just running
dry essentially booted up a hardware
monitor and yeah the temps were
skyrocketing like in the mid 90s to like
the high 90s almost hit a hundred
degrees Celsius on one of the cores and
I eventually just powered the system off
and this is a very mixed bag of feelings
for me right now because in one regard
I'm very very excited that we actually
got to run some tests that showed good
performance really solid performance
with an AO cooler in the node 202 at the
same time did we build a fully
functional system that works 100% of the
time with an AO cooler with an AO cooler
inside of it no we did not we fell bare
just barely short of that so I'm very
disappointed in that regard however I
will not let this get me down while this
is really all the time I have to spend
I've already consumed all my time trying
to get this one solution to work you can
bet your bottom dollar that there will
be a part two to this video where I give
this another go
okay know what screw that I know I said
I was just gonna save the rest of this
project for a part Tube video but I
honestly this has been keeping me up all
night and I'm not going to be able to
sleep until it's done so this is 24
hours later after the last clip that you
saw and since then some things have
happened so after realizing that there
was no way to recover this pump or to
fix it I pretty much just snipped it use
some some wire cutters or whatever and
snipped off the the tubing clean as you
can see it's never going to work again
anyway so now it's definitely not
working maybe I can RMA it or something
and then I'm also getting I bought this
h 550 liquid cooler from Corsair again
another 120 millimeter radiator which is
pretty much the exact same like OAM and
dimensions as this cooler it even has
like the same mounting bracket and
everything for the water block so I just
wanted to keep it really consistent I
will be ditching the Corsair fan that
comes with this unit stock because it's
a pretty noisy from what I hear online
so I'm just going to be using the that
cooler master from our Neptune 120 XL
also you can see here I've already made
the incision that I was talking about
earlier into the the metal cross bar
here that goes between the case and
that's again just to allow for the
tubing to pass through so I don't have
to disconnect the entire water block and
risk not being able to refill it again
it does affect some of the rigidity of
the case you can see it's a it's fairly
it's got some some wobble some flex to
it however I have tested it with the the
rest of the case all enclosed and bolted
down and it's perfectly fine you
wouldn't even notice the difference I
also want to mention that I did file
down the edges of the incision that I
made just so I don't cut myself
accidentally or even worse cut into the
tubing of this cooler and potentially
caused a leak all over hardware
alright installation complete everybody
this was so much easier with this cut
out that I that I made here just being
able to just drop the tubes in there
without having to even crack open the
the water block there was so nice I
don't know why I didn't just do that in
the first place I don't know I was I was
in over my head
apparently but this was super easy to
install I would highly recommend anyone
try this just as long as you have the
right tools and stuff and you know what
you're doing don't hurt yourself Mike I
don't see why this is not a good
solution if you're going to do some
overclocking in the No - OH - that being
said you can see I've got the the hoses
kind of zip tight here so they don't
fray around and get too loose and wild
you can also see that there's really no
kinkajou
I was worried a little bit for at first
that maybe there would be some kinkajou
at the original Zalman cooler there I
don't think I mentioned that before
there is no kinkajou specially with with
this metal bar cutout it gives just a
little bit more breathing room for the
tubes to kind of extend they don't have
to turn so it's such a harsh angle and
this case is going to fall over alright
y'all so I just got done hooking this
bad boy up ran the same Metro last light
benchmark that I ran for the Zalman
Gilman dizzy Amon Kula and was very
happy to see max temps of 68 degrees
Celsius on our hottest core that's
that's freaking awesome for an
overclocked core i7 chip in a case like
this but isn't even supposed to really
feature liquid cooling in the first
place just the fact that you know it's
it's this size it's it's super small
form-factor
and you know doesn't have much air flow
going through it but those temps are
awesome so I'm very happy about that
idle temps are you know hovering around
the low 30s but also spiked up
occasionally to the the mid 40s you know
low 50s things like that but all
together pretty solid acoustics is on
point as well the pump makes virtually
no noise that I can hear over the fans
that are going on in the case that's
pretty much it though guys thank you so
much for watching if you happen to enjoy
this kind of experimental type of video
go ahead and leave me some love in the
comments and let me know also toss me a
like on it if you just enjoyed it and
you have nothing to say other than that
