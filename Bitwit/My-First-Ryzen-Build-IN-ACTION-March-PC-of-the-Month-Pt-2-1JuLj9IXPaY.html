channel today we are taking a closer
look at this beautiful black and red
system right here next to me this is the
March PC of the month
my very first full-blown Rison system
that I've built from the ground up not a
test bed not just a motherboard on a box
with all the things connected but an
actual full-blown system featuring the
Rison 7 1700 processor which is an 8
core 16 thread chip as well as MSI GTX
1080 gaming Z which features a Bend GPU
so that'll be fun to take a look at
later today we're going to be doing the
full gamut of analysis as always
including overclocking temperatures
acoustics and of course gaming
benchmarks we're going to close with
that if you guys want to see a full list
of specs for this PC they are down below
in the description or if you haven't
seen it yet you can go ahead and watch
part 1 of this video where I take a look
at all the parts individually especially
in this case this case the mean it's
5:00 p.m. has gotten a lot of comments
in the last video so I just want to
mention that that's what this case is
now for those of you still wondering but
you can actually see it in action and
watch me build inside of it in part 1 so
I'm going to link that somewhere I
probably probably already have go ahead
check that out watch the assemble the
damn thing and take a closer look at the
individual parts but let's go ahead and
get started with overclocking so we've
got the r7 1700 in there which is a
pretty decent overclocker right I mean
it's actually that chip that is almost
on par in terms of performance with the
1800 with just a little bit of fine
tuning and you get to pay a lot less for
it as well so it's been a crowd favorite
so far in the Rison series the rising
family and I was actually able to take
it to 3.8 gigahertz without touching the
vcore I was doing do a little something
different today I was going to see how
far I could push the chip without
actually adjusting any of the voltage
parameters that's what we're running at
right now as far as the graphics card
goes we got the GTX 1080 gaming Z in
there of course and I was able to only
crank out about 50 megahertz on the
course on the core clock because it is
already pushed balls to the wall by msi
this is like they're literally like
their flagship card right now apart from
the GTX 280 ti that's going to be coming
out very shortly so only a 50 megahertz
offset on the core clock we were able to
get away a little bit more with the
memory clock dialing in a
megahertz offset taking it to thirteen
hundred and thirty nine megahertz
overall as from the core clock we hit a
maximum frequency of two thousand and
eighty eight megahertz however once the
temperature started rising under load we
saw that drop down to a more consistent
and stable 2050 megahertz which still
isn't half bad at all as you might
expect after overclocking our processor
and our graphics card we did introduce a
bit more heat into the equation but not
much so for our r7 1700 that was only
hitting up to fifty five degrees Celsius
and that was with an ambient temperature
in my room of about twenty eight I
believe twenty-eight degrees Celsius is
what it remained throughout yesterday's
testing is when I was doing all these
benchmarks which is which is great 55
degrees C is not bad at all especially
under load overclocked to nearly four
gigahertz and I got to give some praise
to that not to a cooler doing a bang-up
job of keeping thermals and check the NH
u 1 to s or is it you 12s I don't think
it really matters but it's a really
fantastic cooler it doesn't have the
fattiest beat heatsink on it the beat
sink doesn't have a huge heatsink of it
or anything it's only got a single 120
millimeter fan but this is not to a
quality we're talking about and it can
do quite a lot with not too much mass
which is really nice to see it's also
fairly quiet as well take a look at in
the acoustics test momentarily under
load our GT X 1080 hit 81 degrees
Celsius at its hottest which isn't
terrible but it's definitely the warmest
I would like to see it getting these
tests personally there was no thermal
throttling or anything like that so
nothing really to be alarmed of however
it would have been nice to see a bit
chillier temperatures then just barely
staying within its maximum safe
operating temps but on that note so
let's go ahead and talk about acoustics
here the main things to look out for are
the main noise generators in this system
if you will are the case fans we've got
four 120 s
that came included with chassis there's
three on the front this intake one on
the back as exhaust and they are fairly
quiet and effective at moving lots of
air even though it's a bit disappointed
at the LEDs not shining as brightly as
they looked in the pictures they seem to
do a pretty decent job without
generating too much noise
I've actually wired them directly up to
the fam controller the built-in fan
controller on the case there's three
levels there there's off which is I'm
pretty sure zero rpm and we've got low
and high I've actually decided to run
the fans all at the high setting
throughout the entirety of today
tests and I don't know exactly what the
RPM range is on that I would guess
anywhere from 1,800 to 2200 rpm there
abouts but it's fairly quiet so that's
good and we've also got the fan on the
the CPU cooler that's just running at an
auto auto fan curve right out of the box
we've also got two fans on the GTX 1080
of course again those are running as the
auto fan curve out of the box as well so
without further ado ladies and gentlemen
here's a quick idle and load comparison
temperature acoustics test for this
particular PC
so as you might have been able to hear
the acoustic profile in this particular
piece of machinery is quite good and
when I was doing my testing which is
probably you know the whole benchmark
suite probably takes around an hour to
two hours to run I was basically just
having this guy right next to me the
whole time obviously without any sort of
in-game audio over or at least very low
no headphones just coming through the
moderate speakers and not distracting at
all I mean even if the high you know fan
setting and everything running full
throttle overclocked it's a fairly quiet
system and even right now like there are
some pcs of the months where I can't do
this what I'm doing right now where I
actually have the system running Unigine
heaven in the background with the side
panel off because it just is too loud
and picks up on the shotgun microphone
which is like right there you can't
really see it but it's right there so
but I can do that no problem with this
particular PC which is a really nice
it's really nice to see or nice to hear
or nice to not hear yeah so I think on
that note ladies and gentleman let's go
ahead and kick it off with some gaming
benchmarks because I know you guys are
really curious to see those I tested all
three resolutions here I wanted to do
1080p 2560 by 1440 as well as 4k even
though 4k is a little bit ballsy since
this is only a GC X 1080 you really kind
of need a TI if you want to push over 60
FPS consistently with your blade old for
settings and all that
oops sorry caught snagged on the
microphone wire but oh hi honey I love
you q thanks for interrupting my shot of
course the latest little drivers were
used for today's testing that's Version
three 78.92 if I remember correctly I
think that sounds right and that's
pretty much it so you guys know the
drill sit back relax and enjoy the game
in benchmarks to the soothing sounds of
badass meadow
alright so there you guys have the
results this system is definitely no
slouch especially when it comes to the
lower resolutions of 1080 and 1440p
again I did mention that this probably
wasn't going to be a 4k crusher and it
definitely wasn't we actually saw less
than half of the games able to push over
60fps on average which is pretty
expected with the GT X 1080 that being
said this is still a kickass machine if
you're going to be gaining at
resolutions lower than 4k which granted
most of us are I'd say like 98% of the
population still is if not 99.9 could be
honest but overall other thoughts we did
encounter some CPU bottlenecking as I
also suspected that was in GTA 5 and I
believe hitman we actually saw the
almost the exact same frame rates
between 1080p and 1440p because we were
so heavily CPU bowed at that point the
the GP was just running circles around
our CPU unfortunately the 1700 could not
keep up in those particular tests but
hey it's it's something that happens it
actually this is just what happens this
is normal and on a side note that's also
why a lot of reviewers like to test CPUs
at lower resolutions like 1920 by 1080
or even below that in order to expose
any sort of CPU bottlenecks by making
the game particularly CPU bound overall
getting back on track here
a very fast system I added the parts up
in my head really quick I don't know how
accurate it is but I would say anywhere
between 1300 to 1500 dollars for this
particular PC depending on where you buy
all your parts from and when so overall
very formidable thank you mr. Rison PC
for being fast and looking cool and
thank you guys for watching this video I
think this is where I'm going to wrap it
all up so if you enjoyed it go ahead and
please toss me a like on it it helps me
a lot and also feel feel free to leave
some feedback in the comments below with
what you think about this particular
system and I want to see a show of hands
which which of you in the crowd are
running writing CPUs right now I'd love
to hear all about it down below that's
going to do it for now guys also feel
free to check out fit with ultra I'll
put a link somewhere which is my early
access ad-free channel which is only a
buck 50 a month I know I'm selling
myself a little short but it's all the
same stuff that you see on here just a
week early so go ahead and check that
out it's super dirt cheap
and yeah my stuff in the store all that
jazz and I'm going to go edit this video
now so have a good one I'll see you all
in the next video I was really bad at
the truck guy redo it you know
no one should</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
