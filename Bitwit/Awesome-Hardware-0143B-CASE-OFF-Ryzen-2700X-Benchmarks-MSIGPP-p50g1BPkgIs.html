spring and onward here I need I need to
bring I need to bring my fan oh yeah
because the AC cuts off it's not too bad
right around the time is just warm
enough that got a little yeah I know I'm
a little a little icky just a tad moist
just a smidge moist the misty moist day
morning I should just bring a fan in
here
foggy was the well I'm gonna buy a fan
chanced upon it old man are you all
dressed in leather fucking saying I
don't know this is a crime that my wife
has said four times what I think it's
kind of weird and kinky cuz she's like
leave old dude he's all dressed in
leather I'm like what the hell's going
on
S&amp;amp;M thing or something like that but
before we go off on how much of a kangan
yep hello everyone and welcome to
awesome hardware also at 143 your life
right now
beat two both yes we were alive oh shit
I didn't realize you'd gone lie to
YouTube
we only ever stopped going live to
YouTube so the only thing I could have
gone life to was YouTube I missed that
because twitch was still life
okay alright I'm here hey everyone I'm
still opening up my chat so that I can
see what you guys are saying and stuff
it's in the intro yeah but hey welcome
this is yeah like Paul said episode 143
be be 143 B if you missed part a go
ahead and watch it on Paul's channel
I'll put a link in the description if
you're watching on twitch welcome back
it's a tech news show we like to have
fun we talk about lots of different
things and sometimes we curse computer
so if that's a problem then sorry in
advance also we like to have a few
drinks if that's a problem
sorry again sorry not sorry it's like we
don't like beer we don't want to like
taint or otherwise lead anyone down a
path the corruption of corruption or
evilness abuse at the same time you know
just we're having a beer yeah something
wrong with that so it's a free country
please drink responsibly join us if
you're interested but only if that's
something that you that you think
it's right for you as a person you know
and if you if you have some against beer
you certainly can't have anything
against drinking beer out of an amazing
bit with glass Hey look at that okay
what a glorious segue can Wow amazing
what's even better is that you can buy
these you can actually own this dude a
purchase or at least go to my store with
money bit with tech slash store let's go
that we don't accept Bitcoin yet look
but hey cold hard cash is is still in
the trending the circle twenty ounce of
pre o pint glass twenty ounces bitch
there it is oh yeah this is good stuff
bye bye the other new thing from my
store which is the the rip gamepad shirt
which I'm very proud of I think it's
hilarious it kind of has the same sort
of vibe as the CPU cooler shirt which is
the most popular design on the store of
all time and yeah it's a it's a keyboard
and a mouse about to ravage and probably
eat a poor Xbox controller he looks he
looks so cute doesn't mean why do all
your designs have this like vaguely
rapey vibe I don't know it's something
that I'm innately attracted to it's part
of my personality a little bit this
one's a little bit less rapey and a
little bit more like no they're just
gonna eat this thing it's a little bit
more bondage even because it's got like
the wrapped up the cord wrapped up like
literally bonded is this a mechanical
keyboard of these genuine Cherry MX keys
those are cherry MX red switches with
red LEDs but I've been told it is RGB
the user just prefers red and the mouse
kinda kinda looks like Darth Vader that
that's of course not intentional and
constitutes no infringement of copyright
or intellectual property absolutely not
I also kind of thought it locally a
little bit like a Razer DeathAdder oh
yeah but not but not it's obviously not
that death death Vader is the
combination of death Death Adder Vader
Darth Darth Vader Darth Vader's better
that's genius guys if you buy from
either of our stores - Paul's during the
show where I'll shout out your name at
the end I also have a store I don't have
any any cool new stuff right now but
it's all real high quality at all ships
from the same place so if you order
together you'll get shipped together and
if you buy the awesome hardware stuff
it's the the profits are split between
us so don't feel nervous if you and feel
like I really want that awesome Hardware
shirt
you don't have to change you still know
I can't choose between Paula Kyle don't
worry we split it evenly oh and also I
think this is a good thing to say it to
be start just to start saying at the
beginning of the show is if you guys
would like to do timestamps if someone
would like to do timestamps for either
half of our shows of the episode then
please do we really appreciate it I'm
saying at the beginning now because if
you guys want to like follow along and
just mark down the timestamps as we go
about the show it might be a little bit
easier for you instead of after the fact
I also yeah I will suck the shit out of
that kak no question like antidotes and
said oh yeah you'll need a table of
contents of my dick second you'll need
timestamps we waited long enough after
the the adult the warning it's all
language warning right yeah yeah cool
that's just waiting for that hopefully
your strike doesn't strike upon us all
right let's move on to the show let's
get into the meat yeah all right Thank
You Chet for clipping that part of the
show already
all right let's I saw a twitch clip fly
up it has to be that I can't be managed
anyone else all right
I had to refresh my okay we're doing
Pitt my PC we're doing pin my PC first
you guys have submitted some of your
entries some of your rigs at your
personal rigs and Paul and I are gonna
compete critique them and try to help
you out because no rig is perfect let's
be honest not even you know arctic
panther or hotline or anything like that
I mean hotline is pretty perfect but
definitely not Arctic Panther but you
know what I'm saying you guys at least
could could use our help is what I'm
saying
mostly mine's like at the very least
this gives us this sort of like they
feeling of superiority because we're
pointing out you know shortcomings and
other people's work yeah absolutely I
mean no but I but ideally ideally and
we've heard feedback from people before
people take our suggestions to implement
them and then they and then they get
they have a better life they have a
better life more sex just bigger bigger
dicks usually usually a large a larger
penis and what else their voice gets
deeper they can richer and their car
gets better it's the same car same car
it's like faster it's just faster and it
looks nicer and it's like you can they
they're able to like skip an oil change
it's like wow yeah right usually after
3,000 miles I really I wouldn't need an
oil change but now I'm like up five I'm
almost a six yeah still going still
going strong and somehow it just becomes
electric yeah alright for this segment
you've got a core i7 4770k it 4.3
gigahertz GTX 1086 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance pro 256 SSD and a three
terabyte hard drive very nice system
taking a look at it from the get-go the
first thing I noticed is that you kind
of got a very nice color neutral thing
going on here black mostly black a
little bit of white accents there on the
CPU core which is a nice big fan text
tower those are pretty sexy um your
cable management looks pretty solid too
the most I forget the model on this
fantex cooler yes weird names is one of
their earlier products and this was when
I came out and they kind of smacked a
Noctua around a little bit this is a
very good air cooler I feel like very
underrated too big old fans it was
underrated I think his fan text wasn't
very well known at the time right but
it's super solid it wasn't as good as a
knock to as like an NH D 14 or D 15 but
it was right up there
gave it a rose right up there and it was
a little bit less expensive so it's a
solid choice for an air cooler yeah and
I like what you've done here everything
looks pretty well put together I'm a
huge 600 T fan always will be since that
was the first case I ever built in yeah
and and still I think the case holds up
I mean it's got great cable management
for being as old as it is it looks like
you've used that drive cage at the
bottom pretty much fully it looks like
it's simple fully populated with drives
I would say remove the power supply
sticker at least the one on the side
because when you got like the friggin
you know rail table right there it
doesn't look all that attractive
so maybe get a heat gun take a heat gun
of that and fix that up it also looks
like I might be crazy other yellow
accents on the motherboard I think so
yeah okay okay I couldn't help those
were like random stickers MSI
motherboard okay so I mean there's not
much you can do about that
unless you want like spray paint or
whatever but I don't think it looks bad
because it's mostly covered up by that
massive cooler and also it's a pretty
large graphics card - yeah so I don't
really have much to say here then you
could get some nice black sleeved cables
okay the cable extension kit would would
kind of you know give give that final
bit of finish to that I would almost
like ditch the kit of the extensions and
just go for the full length cable since
you don't have a basement I will say
that I fell out of love with these fans
that ship and the 600 T by defaults
their LED fans I had at least one
version where I wouldn't snipped all the
LEDs because I just didn't like the
clear plastic when the white LEDs going
across them yeah these are definitely a
viable upgrade opportunity for you
although there's not a whole lot of I
think these a 200 millimeter they may
they may be either so they're definitely
not so you might be limited on your
upgrade potential for those but right
that's something where I could see you
might be able to get something that's a
little bit quieter and a little bit
better at air flow but like Kyle said
overall you got a really solid Sabich
and build there yeah I definitely know
that there are you can do two to one 20s
at the top for sure yes but this was
also before cases were a super privy to
radiator support so it's really tough to
get
a 240 AO up there there's just not
enough room beyond just the fans but but
yeah I agree with Paul those fans look
pretty dated at this point but thank you
very much yes games moving on to Mike
with a 46 7 DK 4 gigahertz and Asus z87
a a hyper 212 EVGA 1050 ti super super
clocked 16 gigs of Crucial Ballistix
sport ddr3 and of course here TX 650
Coolermaster 1/2 912 interior has been
spray-painted o with a Samsung 840 Evo
120 gig Seagate 2 terabyte drive it's a
it's a modern half 9 12 it is I like
that it is so the the original 912 1/2
912 did did not have a scene in interior
silver really yeah this is I didn't
realize going back to I want to say
2007-2008 coolermaster era and the 912
was a solid case like functionally you
could get all your parts in there and
everything but it did not have a painted
interior and just especially as trends
were changing at that time the painted
interior kind of became one of those
sought after premium things so the 912
kind of fell out of favor because it
really looked pretty horrible when he
compared it to the you know other cases
that had painted interiors right so I I
like this and you can't even tell like
yeah I wouldn't even I mean at least in
the photos it looks like professionally
done from from afar there's no like you
know graininess that sometimes is a sign
of poor spray-painting ship yeah so it's
really I don't know what kind of
disassembly he did in order to do the
painting but must have had to do a lot
of missing I would imagine now we have
the obvious um you know knocked to a fan
to lemma here where it's like ah they're
such good fans that looks so ugly but
the rest of the system is pretty well
color-coordinated that they don't stand
out too much they like the only color
accent so yeah they're not bothering me
much apart from the ketchup and mustard
cables yeah ketchup and mustard cables
on the power supply
are definitely standing out the most as
well as I would say your front panel IO
cables down here also one of those
legacy items from older cases that it
took them a while to update on different
cases depending on how much money they
wanted to spend right
but yeah swapping those cables would
would finish things off here I think a
bit and I'm gonna say leave you're not
too offense
leave them yeah I'd be proud of them and
because you have neutralized all the
other effective colors in the case I
think they work and you know what if if
you're on the fence like if it's kind of
the color of the Noctua fans are sort of
bothering you clearly you're not afraid
of using spray paint yep so fans are
really not that dashing sure you and you
really only need to get like one or two
sides of it really good the other sides
don't really matter because they won't
ever be seen yes thank you very much
Mike
next up we have nemesis neecy's
ka point two gigahertz a EVGA GTX 1060
super super clocked 80-day 256 gig SSD
Corsair Vengeance 3,000 megahertz DRAM
I'm not sure what the capacity is one
terabyte WD hard drive each 100 IV - and
he says don't laugh at my CD DVD Drive
he has a brick 500 watt power supply
with mustard and ketchup cables and an
extra 3.0 USB 3.0 hub just to charge my
bluetooth headphones all right so that's
that's this add-on card right here right
yeah okay all right oh 16 gigs around
okay so 16 gigs of ram is a it's a good
good pairing for your 6700 K if you were
for some reason running on eight gigs
that would have been like oh man that's
that's too little but I like that
compared with SSD and your power supply
is probably the weakest link here when
it comes to your actual overall
performance but that said we're talking
aesthetics here so obviously you you
already knew we were gonna give you shit
for your
for your cd/dvd drive everything else in
this case apart from maybe your power
supply cables has some level of
aesthetic consideration being done to
them except for this damn cd/dvd drive
it needs to be spray-painted yeah with
the extensions for that is horrible SATA
cable yeah yes spray peanuts maybe you
can do a you can get some you know a
decal or something like like it's put
over there I don't know carbon-fiber
sticker or something like that gorgeous
damn it you have a case that doesn't
hold on here alright so something bottom
what what what nothing yeah this no I'm
not sure if that's an SSD here what
alright so we have these extra cables
lying around here at the bottom those
should be tucked away you have a power
supply shroud down here you can fit a
lot of extra cabling down there yeah
just any excess cables loops should be
pushed back behind the motherboard tray
you have a supplemental CPU power
connector coming up here with a very
garish yellow cabling going and and I
feel like there should be a behind the
motherboard tray routing possibility for
you here alright I don't think we have
the case listed we're not sure what kind
of cases is but it's at least a case
that has a power supply shroud right
easy there should be routing behind the
motherboard tray for this cable that's
what's standing out to be the most when
you look but look above the motherboard
it doesn't look like there's any like
routing area so maybe you're at like I
don't know I've never but I've never
seen a case that has the power supply
basement shroud that doesn't have
something like that or available anyway
if that's not possible if you can't
ratify on the motherboard trade then
definitely just a sleeved extension for
that cable in particular would cling
things up because it's yellow and it
stands out to chance and it's a
Thermaltake RGB fan controller on the
bottom oh okay yeah I can see the
thermaltake logo RGB fan controller also
you don't have any intake fans
you see the fans on your radiator are
set to exhaust oh they're all exhaust so
you're probably gonna get a lot of dust
buildup which is fine if you're ok with
cleaning your system regularly and if
your temps are fine I'm not gonna be the
guy it's like new technical input intake
and exhaust if your temps are fine then
whatever and if your dust buildups fine
whatever but you know it's it's worth
pointing out that most cases will have
some degree of intake at the front of
the case especially because you have a
dust filter at the front of this case
most likely or some way to to catch the
dust and also you would be in taking
fresh air through that radiator instead
of pushing warm air through it you know
being radiated off of your gtx 1060 so I
would also say temperatures just final
comments stretched we've got the
stretched tubing here for the all-in-one
cooler yeah I I never liked hip-hop I
never liked how this wouldn't stretch
too taut like this however however I
also can appreciate when you figured out
that it would actually fit there you're
like oh my gosh there's just enough for
me to actually fit things in here and
mount them properly
you're probably kind of happy about that
so you know don't don't don't completely
dismiss those emotions but something
that you might be able to do to
introduce some slack here I was gonna
say would be to do push pull on this on
the radiator but it doesn't look like
you maybe have enough room down there so
I don't know a solution for that but I'm
just just to round out the critiques
that doesn't look the best but nemesis
lkg thank you for sending that over and
hopefully we've given you a few
suggestions that maybe in the future you
could use thanks man
and preview aesthetics RJ ok hey so he's
got his specs listed in a different link
so he's got an AMD Rison 7 1700 X sorry
an NH u 12s as he am for cpu cooler from
noctua
a su Strix X 370 F gaming ATX AM for
motherboard 16 gigs rip jobs 5
looks like you've got an end sorry
burping a lot NZXT source 224 our case
and yeah okay cool um first thing that
stands out is your CPU cooler tower is
horizontal and your fan is really close
to your graphics card so when you're
under load and your graphics card heats
up I mean it's really it's your fans
super close to the actual GPU where the
GPU is in that card and that could sort
of give off a lot of heat when you're
under load and it might affect your CPU
temperatures I'm not sure but something
to bear that in mind I would potentially
try testing it out to see how it
performs in a more vertical orientation
and maybe you'll drop a couple degrees
there if that's important to you but if
you're still under well under t.j.maxx
and you don't care everything's fine
fine aesthetically I also think it looks
a little awkward just personally yeah a
lot of cabling down at the bottom with
hard drives galore simply and there's
not really much you can do based on how
the hard drives to mount inside of this
case and you know nowadays that drives
down there and that quadrant of a case
are typically mounted perpendicular and
so you've got all the cables towards the
back of the motherboard tray and that
seems to be a bit cleaner especially you
don't have a basement or anything so not
sure what you can do there maybe it's
time for a case upgrade it still looks
like you know you're on rise you're on a
rise and based system so you don't need
to upgrade your cork internals your core
components here but maybe it's time for
a case upgrade and color coordination
looks pretty neutral apart from the
knock to a fan of course which we've
already discussed so I won't get into
that and some of us say the cables you
use in here for what looks to be an
optical drive up top with a red SATA
cable that's a big no-no for me and
another red or orange looking one down a
little bit lower than that this is also
it's a knock to a cooler and it's a you
know it's a current generation platform
this is a rise in seven 1700 X and a
asus strix
X 370 dash F motherboard so you should
have the ability to rotate this 90
degrees
you know flip putting the fan on the top
of it would be one option but I would
actually rather have it vertical so that
the fan is pushing air towards the back
of the case and back towards this
exhaust fan and I think that would
balance things out a little bit better
as well
beyond that I agree with Kyle a new case
is probably what you're looking for most
as far as giving yourself more options
for cable routing as well as making
things look cleaner overall next last
but not least we have Chazz urge
everyone for within the Imperial
Devastator I like that
all right here you'll devasting down an
EVGA four gigabytes 1080 TI super clock
nigh 546 70 Kalyan seen asus rog maximus
7 8 gigs of g.skill rhenium we've got a
half stacker another half case half
stacker 935 Acker another tried-and-true
classic and of course our GB lights
cheers let's see here so you've got a
big Vader decal on the side panel so
he's gonna Star Wars of course be given
the name of his PC that makes like I
like the coordination going on here with
the side panel the desktop background
retha Matic the mouse pad or keyboard
pad and also he's got a he's got a brew
ready there too so you've got to give
him credit for that
ok good job Chancery all right so okay
so Mac and red theme is a good option to
go with with PC gaming simply because
you have lots of options for getting
matching components things that I think
stand out to me immediately as far as
I'll say on the on the plus side I like
your cable sleeping for your power
supply I think your 24 pin in particular
looks very clean right there I think
actually the precision and the well
trained admission makes the 8 pin up
here look messy by comparison
that's that's what's standing a little
bit to me there beyond that we have a
custom liquid cooling loop just for the
CPU we also have some tubing here that's
hanging I will say it's a little bit
loosely over the graphics card and
dropping down in here to the basement
where I'm guess
there may be as a pump because I think
this is just a reservoir here on the
side so yeah granted we're talking about
a modification to a liquid cooling loop
so that's not the easiest thing but I
feel like the tubing there could be just
trimmed a little bit so that the loop
runs are a little bit shorter and maybe
they're not hanging so they're quite as
loose I'm also curious as to why you
have a custom loop for your CPU but at
1050 TI that is yes so that's the big
question here obviously there's more
investment here going on with the liquid
cooling solution that's practically
speaking maybe could have been invested
on the graphics card granted we don't
know your exact situation when you
bought the graphics card and how much it
cost and all that kind of stuff but yes
practically speaking I think how I would
both have advised you to skip the liquid
cooling solution go with a cheaper air
cooling solution and upgrade the
graphics card to give yourself an
overall more powerful computer I did
notice the Imperial logo on the water
block though okay say the Imperial logo
on the water block is nice the
customization is nice yeah I mean get a
good GPU first and then hardline it yeah
so maybe maybe he's got this setup going
and in the future he's planning to
upgrade the GPU with a water-cooled GPU
and integrated into the loop here and
that would be a total totally viable
solution here so maybe this is a work in
progress
yeah but for anyone who's looking at
something like this yes 100% Cal and I
advise upgrade your core components
upgrade the the base level power of your
system when it comes to CPU and GPU
power and and memory before you go for
the aesthetic improvements the liquid
cooling that kind of thing yeah okay
alright and that concludes cutting my PC
thank you everyone let's move on to the
next segment which is case off stays off
where we take a look at two cases in the
same sort of realm same price point and
similar same form factor and stuff like
that one of these cases have been out
for a while but that's only because it
was the closest case I could actually
ace that finally a face-off oh that's
okay thanks off use your imagination and
pretend the eff down there is a seat see
it all will be fine um so the first case
that all L talked about right now is is
a new case from an tech no less number
one aunt you know remember an tech they
make cases sometimes they used to make
really good cases and they stopped
making good cases and now there's
another case here we'll see you next
one's good let's just ride those good
cases that we made for as long as we
possibly can don't even innovate we'll
just use the same shit so this is their
p6 this is an article from PC Gamer
going over it there's tons of other
outlets talking about this case right
now but it's a $65 micro ATX case okay
with tempered glass all right and I
think that's that's a pretty cool area
or market for cases my interest is
piqued sure and what's interesting about
it or you could say gimmicky interesting
is a relative word is that it has an
integrated led logo projector at the
bottom at the front that beams the logo
and the antic logo on to your desk yes
which is definitely on the gimmicky side
of things but at the same time I could
also see I mean what the fuck is RGB RGB
is pretty damn gimme kazoo okay so
that's taken up this could be the future
in the case so the cakes cost $65 if the
case cost a hundred and forty dollars
and you're like all right how much more
am I paying for this projected logo when
it's 65 bucks and it's gotta know it's
less then then I'm I care less about
about this being gimmicky and a micro
that's just richer all right so but
that's also that's also kind of like I'm
also curious as to whether or not this
would this is gonna start some sort of
trend okay cuz I feel like case
manufacturers right now are scratching
their heads trying to figure out what's
the next big thing what's the next RGB
what's the next tempered-glass because
they're all you know RGB in tempered
glass is old news by now it was the
hottest thing two years ago at CES and
now it's like alright we're all waiting
for the next trend maybe maybe you
projector LED projectors
maybe not just the company's logo but if
you can customize it or it can do like
some sort of weird like rave light show
on your desk or the surrounding area
while you're gaming I mean there's
infinite possibilities here just like
there were with RGB when it first
launched so I think that's cool I think
that we're seeing something that's
potentially trend worthy in the future
coming off of a $65 micro ATX case from
a case manufacturer long forgotten but
moving on here it does have a power
supply basement which i think is also
another one of those trends that's
really taken off in the last couple
years with cases for 65 bucks tempered
glass power supply basement all good
stuff 390 millimeter GPU clearance 160
millimeter CPU cooler tower clearance
you've got 4 2 and 1/2 inch drive mounts
or two three and a half inch slash two
and a half inch mount so plenty of Drive
options actually for a micro ATX case
considering fan support 240 or 280 at
the front 360 or 280 at the top 120 at
the rear radiators you can only do a 240
at the front so hopefully it's the
appropriate depth of case so that you
don't run into any super stretching
issues like we saw with one of the Pitts
my PC submissions where you know the
tubing's not quite long enough or just
barely long enough but it looks like a
fairly compact case especially being
micro ATX and stuff so you can you can
fit a 240 rad in here which is great 2
USB 3.0 at the front i/o and that's
pretty much it for that case honestly
I'm very curious to actually just buy
one of these myself and check it out
because I'm just I think it might be
good it might actually be a decent case
worth buying but its competitor which I
actually had to look harder than I
thought for a competitor that was a
micro ATX case that had a tempered glass
side panel that was a in the realm of 60
to 65 bucks 60 to 70 bucks and what I
found was the in win 301 which is which
has been out for for a while now but
it's the closest thing I could find in
terms of functionality size feature set
and available on Amazon for $63 and
every price and 3 set yep that's down
from its normal $70 price tag so well
let's take a look at this case it's it's
also got a to list a tool a tempered
glass side panel but is toolless I think
that's a big plus
a tool a side panel is great I agree the
GPU clearance isn't quite as long as the
p6 it's got three hundred and thirty
millimeter clearance which is granted
probably big enough for most users
anyway same cpu clearance as a one
hundred and sixty millimeter towers it
does have a power so well I guess it
kind of has the power supply chamber up
top right so the power supply is
actually mounted on top of the case
and it does this it is shrouded to some
degree so you couldn't see any you know
ugly power supply stick or anything like
that um it does have radiator support
with 240 s at the front or 120 at the
rear so very similar actually exactly
the same as the p6 and you can also
mount to 120 millimeter fans at the
bottom if you want to give your GPU some
additional airflow the drive support in
this case is quite a bit more limited
than on the p6 you only get one three
and a half inch / 2 and 1/2 inch tray
and three two and a half inch drive so
the most you could have fit in this in
terms of mechanical drives is one three
and a half inch drive here this single
slot and then you could fit three or
four SSDs so what what I'm thinking is
like I think the p6 has more
functionality built into it for the
price but I feel like the in win 301
because I've actually seen the in win
301 in person I think is gonna have
better build quality and it's gonna look
nicer on the outside you know I think I
think that's that's kind of what I would
sum it up as but I think that the antic
p6 is is gonna be a really competitive
option for that for that price range
it's it's nice to see antique making
semi decent cases again so do we it we
need more variety you have to choose
between these which people should buy
I'm gonna go with the antic p6 just
because I'm rooting for the underdog at
this point and I want to see an tech
make a comeback and like create some
more competition in a very saturated
market it sounds good it sounds good on
paper
I disagree everyone should buy the in
win 301 thank you Paul for making the
segment you know interesting by
contending and opposing that's opposing
stance yes
contentious is the word I was
looking for now everyone has to think
the n1 301 is pretty pretty awesome so
those are the drive options for today
we've we've argued against and for them
you make your own choice choice is yours
moving on to tech news um let's first
talk about this article protect power up
they are discussing a review that was
released not leaked but actually
released in a French PC hardware
magazine which is canard PC review on
the rise in 2700 X haha 2nd gen Rison
reviews are out just not in the US yet
and according to these results that we
saw there is some more power consumption
here than the 1800 X actually 13.2 watts
more power consumed on the 2700 X then
the 1800 X this is a which isn't a whole
lot is printed yes but printed
benchmarks at first I thought that was a
video screenshot and I thought what an
interesting and kind of clever way to
present benchmarks as if it was like a
magazine but then I realized no some
dude just took a picture of a magazine
this is actually printed in a magazine
issue huh which I would subscribe to a
magazine like that that's pretty cool I
mean I use Tennyson franchise to
subscribe to maximum PC alright and then
you stopped when Gordon my um left but
the other thing what's even injured more
interesting is that the CPU did beat out
the 1800 X and the 8780 700 K in a bunch
of synthetic tests synthetic tests the
2700 X reigned supreme however in real
world gaming tests it was actually 1.3
percent slower than a lowly I 580 400
and I say lowly it's a decent it's a
great CPU in its own right but it was
also 14.3% slower than 8700 k
making it just about 4% faster than an
1800 X so it is faster than its then I
guess the 1,800 X shouldn't say it's a
direct predecessor but it is faster but
marginally so the kicker here is that
the CPU the 2700 X was tested on an a320
motherboard which doesn't support
precision boost overdrive or exif r2 and
there was no mention of you know there's
obviously no overclocking ability here
too so it kind of confuses me why they
would test on an angry 21 why would they
test on an a3 like it's a high-end
second gen rise and CPU why test on like
the most basic chipset that has like the
least amount of features I don't know
so take it with a grain of salt to some
degree I mean these are real benchmarks
in a real publication so you know these
are real results but take it with a
grain of salt based on the testing
hardware that was used for the for the
for the benchmarks so that's all I'll
say about that you should just wait for
youtuber reviews to come out shortly
those will certainly be better than
anything you'd find it French magazine
I'm still trying to figure out why they
went with 2700 X instead of 2800 eggs
maybe that's all they had I mean maybe
that like that's the sample they were
given or something I don't know
no but I mean it's been it's been pretty
well confirmed at this point
oh the 27 I confirmed confirmed but like
from all the rumors and everything like
nothing's come out that says 2800 X
2,700 X is the top i8 core 16 thread
rise into CPU right so that's probably
the new flagship that's there's probably
no xx that's the new flagship for this
launch that's the high-end CPU for this
launch I think I know what I'm trying to
figure out is like why did they call it
that
instead of 2800 X and is that
mean that they're in some 2800 X or some
other CPU further out that they're gonna
try to do I launched with I don't know
I'm just I mean the 1800 X didn't really
have the best value like I never
recommended anyone get the 1800 X over
like the 1700 or even the 1700 X yeah so
maybe maybe they don't want to associate
their new flagship with a CPU that was
widely reviewed as being the the worst
value or the worst bang for the buck in
the rise in 7 class I I don't that's
like I don't know I don't know it'd be
interesting to ask a and B that all
right moving on Samson revealed Samsung
revealed an m dot 2 z SSD despite my
notes with the typo saying s SSDs
articles from a man Tech and thank God
it's a short one very uncharacteristic
of them yeah I revealed at Open Compute
Project or OCP summit in San Jose the
brand new Samsung SZ 9 85 uses Z NAND
memory as a low latency competitor to
intel's 3d crosspoint based obtain SSDs
so obtained has a contender it has a
competitor now known as the zine and
SSDs and this is the first time Z SSDs
have been revealed in an MDOT to form
factor they've they've break broken into
that that sector here and it looks to be
looks to have the same Phoenix 8
controller that's been used on the
company's other 9 8 X SSDs this is
likely to be the same controller that's
also used in the successors to the 960
Pro and the 960 Evo so very good very
solid tried-and-true reliable
controllers that are super fast the demo
unit that they had on hand was actually
a 240 gig model although their little
text display listed that they also have
a 480 gigabyte model in the works
the speculation here is that Xena and
the controller is going to take up a lot
more space than alternatives that we've
seen in the past
existing SSDs and that's why they've
only been able to max out 480 gigs on an
m2 stick so maybe as they optimize
things in the future we'll see higher
capacities this raises the possibility
of Samsung introducing a Z SSD for
enthusiast consumers not just for an
enterprise market or something like that
to compete against obtain the obtain SSD
800 P the only question here is we're
not really sure what these Xena and
drives are gonna cost if there's gonna
be a huge uplift in performance with day
to day tasks that's going to warrant the
extra cost or premium that's attached to
these xenon drives so more - more - more
to come on that as details come to light
but I just want to quickly inform you
guys of that popup story so I'll let's
move on to msi saying crazy things about
AMD this is actually an article from our
buddy on twitter adjacent of angelo this
is a Forbes article he's back to writing
stories and stuff and this actually
happened on Sunday this took place on
Sunday you know there was all that
there's been a bunch of madness around
the whole GPP thing and people taking
note of adding board partners like msi
taking down or removing cards from their
store AMD cards from Gerst or with with
like their flagship gaming brand
attached to them so that kind of sparked
a lot of conversation online and one
such user on facebook actually commented
and asked the official MSI page on
Facebook of India there was a India MSI
Facebook page and they asked on that
page they said hey so what's going on
are you guys like fully aligned with
NVIDIA are you part of the GPP are you
guys gonna just start using only nvidia
products from now on and what are the
reps who runs this page responded in a
very unexpected way saying nvidia is
currently ahead in the GPU experience
and you know if nvidia is up to par with
performance msi will definitely be able
to to stop making AMD based products in
the future
in place of nvidia this is huge this is
like whoa where is this coming from it
is serious
no more AMD products from from msi if if
what if nvidia can just keep being
awesome and outperforming AMD in terms
of sales and performance so you could
argue that the rapper is correct to a
certain degree based on different you
know data and analytics like yes nvidia
is currently the biggest GPU supplier
and you know their 10 series cards have
been able to really outperform the AMD
GPUs in a lot of ways but it's not it
wasn't really perfect it wasn't a
official or professional statement of
this rep to say online and so it kind of
sparked this sort of no it just it just
sparked a lot of shit online and there
was also no confirmation or denial of
MSI's GPP involvement so it kind of I
think this comment sort of scared a lot
of people into thinking that wow GPP is
totally real and MSI is just they kind
of have no shame in secretly or like you
know along with it going along with it
really going along with it and sort of
you know just admitting that that this
is this is the way to go so about 10
minutes before we started the livestream
today I noticed on the hardware
subreddit that an update to this story
popped up and this is from PC gamer as
well that the comments from this msi rep
on the india facebook msi page has been
have been deleted and official in an
official statement from msi has been
released saying we apologize for making
an inappropriate comment it did not
represent
MSI's official views so yeah it was just
it was just some dude
who was in charge of the page who
probably isn't anymore just sounding off
when he you know he was kind of out of
place to say these things but there's it
also leaves you know leaves room to to
question whether or not msi is involved
with a GPP type organization
after all there's no custom gaming X
versions of Sega 56 or 64 anywhere on
their website yes there are still some
gaming branded RX 5 eighties and such
500 series cards but a lot of the
flagship cards are nowhere to be found
so it's still very this is still an
ongoing topic that we really haven't
gotten to the real bottom of and we
don't even know if it's actually true no
one's actually confirmed if GPP exists
but there's a lot of weird things in the
air that suggest that it does exist so
stay tuned for for more stories as they
come to light on that but yeah let's
move on talking about Linux Linux Mint
Linux Linux Mint is a company that
announced the mint box Mini 2 it's a
tiny desktop PC with Intel Inside
this articles from ZDNet calm the og the
original mint box Mini was a very well
received and highly highly praised unit
for using the Linux Mint UI which this
websites own Steven J vom von Nicolas
Nichols called it the best of the best
of desktop UI regardless of operating
system
so apparently mint is this is really
good it's a really good really good UI
it's a really good skin over the Linux
operating system and it's made its way
back into these mint box minis within
the form of the mint box mini to the
successor of the original mint box mini
tiny PC replaces the AMD a 4 micro 6400
T to us into an Intel Celeron J 3 455
which performs four times faster on
Geekbench 4 and over 50 50 percent
faster than the mint box pro's CPU which
was the AMD a10 micro 6700 T so it looks
like they've sort of shifted gears going
from AMD based CPUs to Intel Celeron so
and the gains here at least in Geekbench
I mean that four times faster that's
that's pretty cool it's even fast
than the older generations pro model of
the PC other improvements include going
from Edo to 11 n to 802 mm an AC Wi-Fi
that's dual band changes the second HDMI
port to mini DisplayPort I think that's
great added a second USB 3.0 port on the
front i/o and the chassis is based on
computer is fit let to fameless'
designed with a taller top heatsink so
the case itself is actually serving to
do some thermal dissipation therefore
the internal components so hopefully it
doesn't get too hot supports up to 16
gigs of memory and it arrives in two
flavors come June the mini two ships
with four gigs of RAM and a 64 gig SSD
for 300 bucks the mini pro 2 doubles
doubles that ram capacity and boost
storage up to 120 gig SSD for just 50
bucks more which i think is a pretty
pretty fair price for a mini PC if you
were just doing some some slight you
know workstation stuff or you just
wanted something to tinker with looks
like it's also got a micro SD card slot
on that tube which is pretty cool so
yeah and it's it's tiny it's really tiny
so you could easily slap this on the
back of your monitor or something like
that if you want to be super discreet
with it and probably just has like a
regular DC power course um but yeah cuz
that's that's that's what that is let's
let's move on to our last article for
today which is about Apple Apple o go to
Apple potentially surpassing its 1
billion dollar content budget new shows
from the tech giant could debut as early
as March 2019 this articles from ARS
technica thanks guys
Apple may pump out several new series
between March 2019 and the summer TV
show in the summer of that same year yes
yes
you thought Netflix was the end-all
answer to internet streaming Paul oh do
I have news for you sir yeah um there
have been aware of Apple's making shows
yeah neither neither was i I had no idea
apparently they've already signed 12
content deals since last fall 9 of these
are straight to series shows which means
they're gonna skip the whole pilot
process entirely and they're just gonna
be full-fledged
series from the get-go very efficient
the content will also aligned with the
company's bright optimistic brand
identity which as the article states we
may not be seeing a game of Thrones
esque series from the big company it's
gonna be bright optimistic and cheery
so only good things all the time only
only great fun happy joyous I don't know
I don't know what that I don't know what
they mean by that like our is there's
not gonna be any like blood or violence
and any of their series it has to align
with their bright optimistic is every
series that Apple puts out gonna look
like and feel like an apple commercial
well there be blood will there be blood
definitely they won't be making a sequel
to that movie that's for sure but Anna
and I'm also very curious to see how
much Apple product placement is injected
into these series played on the Apple TV
hey hey used hey you hold me on my
iPhone use iTunes for that
wait he's dead oh he was using an
Android phone
uh-uh no wonder fuck here have an apple
I tried to tell you use a green bubble
it wasn't as a green bubble what I don't
know I don't know
wait you're not familiar with the green
bubbles for texting yeah Oh like that
means the green bubbles that is a
Greenville know that pop up when you're
going you're typing so people know
you're typing no oh no no your cum is it
green bubble what green I don't know if
this is an Apple thing I don't know yeah
it's cuz you're ashamed of your green
bubble what you don't know you see
anybody you know you know you don't even
know you've probably been shunned you've
probably been been the green the green
of conversations because if you're a
green but why are you ashamed of it
though I don't get it
the green bubble what's so bad about the
green bow the green bubble is
Kyle I'm surprised I'm glad I'm glad at
this point that I'm able to introduce
you and perhaps others out there who
might be unaware of the stigma of the
green bubble what is the meaning of this
green bubble conversation the green
bubble so so if you if you have an
iPhone it won't be green and you want to
do a group message uh-huh and you have
all your friends and you put them all a
group message so you can all group
message together and do one of those
super exciting fun group messages that
everyone gets notifications for it isn't
annoying at all if you include someone
in that group message who is say an
Android user then their bubble will show
up as green that sounds special not blue
tones like a feature that no no because
because normal bubbles are blue I think
they're blue or gray that's gray and and
green bubbles people who have green
bubbles are excluded shunned and
otherwise left out from any you know
social that is such an Apple move yeah
god that's annoying so that's the point
I'm trying to get out here okay maybe
it'll be called the green bubble and
it'll be like it'll be like the shimmer
from annihilation it'll just start
slowly expanding and destroy everything
that it encompasses but yeah if you if
you have ever been in a conversation
with people and it's just kind of
falling off Prabhas you were the green
bubble oh shit screaming bubble it's
good etiquette guys and everyone just
kind of backs away who invited the green
bubble all right anyway apples making
some shit you know they're making
they're making TV shows watch it or
don't I don't care they've signed a
bunch of stars I'm sure it's gonna be
all gray they probably all use not green
bubbles dicks the pink bubble crew
unclear if all the contents gonna live
behind a paywall I'm sure it is
and yeah apples got a lot of catching up
to do but they've also got over you know
almost 300 billion dollars to show out
to catch up with in a year's time it's
probably not an issue for
and I think there's kind of sucks I mean
in a sense
I enjoy only having one or two logins
because why Vsauce and I have cut the
cord a long time ago we haven't had a
cable or TV subscription in you like a
decade plus and so we enjoy just logging
into you know Netflix or Amazon like
Netflix and Amazon we bounce back
between but now we're gonna have I mean
we're not gonna we're never gonna sign
for Apple whatever anything Apple styles
probably not but if there's like
exclusive shows that go to Apple then
like fuck what do we gonna do after like
we're gonna have to either like suck
apples dick and and pay for it
or we're just gonna have to not enjoy
those shows and be like fuck we don't
know what's going on in that awesome
show that seems to be trending and
everyone's watching right now so fuck
we're like not relevant anymore fuck us
and then there's like Disney Disney's
also starting the streaming service
they're gonna have like Pixar and Disney
series and films on there and and they
just bought 24 they might buy 21st
century fox twentieth century fox I
don't know I I don't I don't like having
all these logins for streaming I want it
to be simple again I want to stay simple
but that's my half of the show people
thank you very much for the pantomiming
fall I think I think that should be a
segment that should be a segment Paul
that should be a segment where I talk
about a new story and you just pantomime
the whole fucking thing I'm done I'm
done make it a regular segment on your
half pal doing it rip better better in
the second half though yes all right so
we have some leftover donations from
Paul's half I guess we'll start there
starting with a bomb for the $25
donation I have an Origin Kronos PC with
an 8700 K water-cooled 32 gigs of RAM
GTX to 1080i and I can't get over 40 FPS
on lower demanding games like World of
Warcraft 60 FPS for League of Legends
what the heck what gives any ideas are
you sure you're not gaming on your 8700
K's in a good
ethics make sure that your like your
DisplayPort or your display cable is
plugged into your graphics card for
starters actually a bomb what I don't
what I would tell you is you have an
Origin PC and there's absolutely no
excuse for an Origin PC with 32 gigs of
ram and 8700 K and a 1080 Ti to be
running the games that you're talking
about at that frame rate one of the
benefits that you get if you buy a
completely built PC usually is that it
has a warranty some capability of
contacting the people who built that in
order to get some help and some
assistance and that is what I definitely
think you should do in your case because
you paid for it you paid for it you have
a very nice system based on the specs
you've told us and you should be getting
much better for performance than that
so origins should be able to help you
out with that I don't know I yeah I
don't know too much beyond that based on
the details you've given but hopefully
origin can help you out because all we
can verify is for you is that yeah
League of Legends World of Warcraft not
very graphically intensive games and a
1080 TI should be able to tear through
those at 200 300 frames per second or
better yeah all right tom-toms brims
myths 15 or we talk speaking of mining
my 980ti profitability dropped from
three heroes and day one in in day two
one zero
per day to one euro in one month
electricity cost is about point nine
euros in the de bruit it wow that's
that's a big drop so yeah your
profitability went from 200 to the third
yeah it dropped down to a third of what
it was 10% and yeah and that's and with
the electricity cost where it is I mean
that's only point one euro that you're
making there buddy
so yeah but on the plus side the flip
side to that is that your lack of
profitability with mining it
is everyone else's game hopefully gain
in the reduced viability of GPUs to mine
with who wants Tom's 980ti four to two
dollars
so Tom's I'm sorry you're not able to be
as profitable as you used to be with
your 980ti
but it's but I hope that means that
other people are able to buy a 918 980ti
or 1070 or anything in that range for a
reasonable price it's the circle of life
all right thank you very much Tom's
another Tom's port option and for
another fifty Norwegian kroner by the
way Kyle how you setup CS server me and
my wife want to try spec attack
we don't really setup a CS server we
just create a private game
I invite wifey sauces counter joins it
tennis trick yeah that's usko so we
don't really need to create a server or
anything like that no hosting involved
just you know private matchmaking as
long as your friends on Steam you should
be able to do just fine
bazinga it's $25 how soon after the
video did Heather's dad call about the
handcuff comment made about them being
on the bedpost lol I did have a question
but someone already asked it so I went
with this comment instead wifey sauces
dad is extremely cool
he's extremely cool and if he ever calls
me to address a comment like that in one
of our videos he mainly just says I was
voting malarious that was awesome keep
it up
like he's that cool so so that's why we
constantly pushed the boundaries as to
what we can get away with it's that it's
that that final five minute window and
five five five minute we have a boy I'll
show get a little floating everything's
great
and b67 13 dollars and 37 cents how do
you encounter any configuration or
overclocking problems with the ex 99m
Taichi micro ATX motherboard I'm
considering purchasing one for my
upcoming to your for build I have not
actually loaded up windows onto it yet
I've just simply
to the PC and it is glorious there will
be a part to rest assured Paul is
carrying it right now it's a micro
episode is really nice so we got four
dimm slots the not impressed a nose that
is 32 gigs of ram in there which is more
than most people systems and it's more
than enough to handle the WMA footage a
gig dims all over price right now
because you're trying to profit you
could do you can do 16 gig did right
there try they'll do 60/40 I try to make
more money after a cake dims huh you
know you know my $12,000 elite build
only maxes out about 20 gigs I think my
spine is ladies when when rendering
compress I should put this down put it
down before you break it okay
isn't it nice though isn't it it's very
nice computer um
rest assured MB in part two I'll be
discussing overclocking reliability and
all that sort of thing
so stay tuned for that I'm very excited
for that as well Baha $5 but GPU prices
dropping should I upgrade my MSI RX 560
ITX OC pre-cut down Bowl to something
better I have no plans of going past
1080p hmm I would give it a give it a
month me give it a month or two yeah
like I don't know where they might go
down further we're seeing some
inflection we're seeing some dip that we
haven't seen for a while
so I don't know like the worst-case
scenario is that prices just bounce back
up in which case we're giving you jewel
advice right now and you should have
bought a 50 to $100 over price card but
I think that there's some like I think
there's some kind of bubble action
that's been going on for the past six
months to a year and I think there's
some like leveling out that's that's
bound to occur and if that ends up being
that GPU prices are a little bit higher
than they were before
I think that is a better end result than
GP prices being double because of the
inflation due to the demand from
cryptocurrency mining so I think I think
we are gonna see some leveling out and I
think at this point because we're only
just starting to see that leveling out I
think it's worth holding up a month or
two to see what prices continue to do
what effects the introduce and
introduction of like and aetherium basic
miner has on the market as a whole right
and also what effect the potential
upcoming launch of new GPUs from Nvidia
and AMD has as well yeah we're at a very
pivotal point right now where a lot of
things could change or stay the same get
better or worse we're not sure so just
hold out a little bit longer but if but
if prices go up it's not our fault and
if they go down I would say going from
an aurochs 560 look to see what you
could get a GTX 1074 10-7 done me a
solid upgrade very even jumping from a
560 to a 570 or 580 is a pretty nice
jump to so in 1066 gig maybe or
something like that
keep an eye keep an eye on all those
cards stay woke all right tighten heel
heel bear keep $1 thank you very much
showing Kyle some love currency s agent
at new egg oh hey new egg fam everyone
asked about Paul but not Kyle really
Alex mentioned Kyle please bring me a
mousepad in person at the call center me
love you long time Kyle song well Paul I
blame that he's the originator of new
egg TV he's been there a lot longer than
I actually worked at warehouse one
customer service I actually worked at
warehouse one for an extended period of
time the agent means customers
franchisee Oh bar H if you're a CS agent
you're probably still at warehouse one
over there and in lovely Whittier
California or everyone just hates me
ih explains I got a job at new egg in
2005 so I don't oh you're all right I'll
give you I'll give you an old-school
story from my end and I apologize that
it's not more positive looking but I got
a job I got a job at new ID in 2005 and
I worked at that warehouse one and
woodier
which is the original Newegg building
four three two to three years before I
moved over to warehouse seven every
single year that I worked there and I
was at warehouse one they told us that
they were gonna they were gonna move
customer service to in the location they
were gonna upgrade warehouse one to a
better location with better air
conditioning and like not rats that died
in the walls and stuff like that and and
and it never happened so point being
they still there yes as far as as far as
I know if you contact me a customer
service you're still gonna be talking on
the plus side to an actual United States
citizen in the city of Whittier
California which I've always given you a
credit for like they have not done that
yes they do outsource some of the email
responses and everything to China
because if you have a team in China that
responds to everything as well but the
vast majority of new a customer service
is based in the United States in
California and thumbs up to them for
that I wish no egg would invest a little
bit more or at least back when I worked
there I had always wished the new a good
invest a little bit more in the
facilities the customer service lived in
and worked at I went to warehouse one
once house started working I knew egg
and joined me when I were working at
warehouse 7 right which was fine it was
a nicely in the City of Industry yeah
just 510 models for me maybe a few
months after I got the job at new egg
working at warehouse 7 I had to go to
customer store I had to go to the
warehouse 1 for something I there to
pick up something for us or something
for myself
and I just remember thinking what oh my
god this this is like the like they just
shoved customer service into this corner
of shame that like it barely had walls
it just looked dilapidated and just
there's like a shitty fence around it
like just like the chain fence that you
see like around homes do be fair that is
where new eggs started new egg before
they had any of the locations that was
the rich
location that's fine but they maintain
you can start the inning they maintains
that location they kept renting it even
after they had expanded into the
locations and City of Industry otherwise
you know honestly Kyle and I can only
speak for a new egg goings-on up till
2012-2013 when did we 2015 no 2014 14 14
14 2014 2015
yeah beyond that we have no idea they've
maybe everything is different now and
they've changed but point being
thank you hi lung hi no I'm sorry thank
you see I didn't heal by thank you
tithing heal bar H for your donation and
we wish you the best of luck as ACS

Jones says $20 heyguys a heyguys
question do you think all the technology
that comes in Vega 56 and 64
for example HBM to DirectX 12 Vulcan is
more future proof or ready for
technological changes in future games
versus gddr5 plus memory does I don't
think that's an apples to apples
comparison that you're talking about
there simply because you're talking
about memory and memory is memory memory
is like a finite quantifiable parking
space right and whatever game that
you're playing might want to park more
or less textures in that space right if
you follow me follow me here okay
so filling it up filling up a can yes so
the ability to put stuff into that
parking space and take it out of that
parking space to make use of it is going
to be your memory speed now granted when
you move from something like Judy dr5 X
memory or gddr5 memory to something like
hvm memory we're talking about a a vast
increase in the bandwidth the
communication between the memory and the
processor which with gddr5 and g dr g GJ
r 5x is much narrower but that gddr5 and
gddr5 X memory is natively faster so
come so there's a trade-off balance
there yeah so memory speed is definitely
important definitely has a factor in the
overall performance of a graphics card
but going back to your original question
the core technology the the architecture
of what a Vega GPU is made from when
you're talking about future-proof I
really reply it doesn't really apply to
be honest DirectX 12 Vulcan I mean
that's a lot of that is up to the
developers but they want to optimize
their games for you know like doom for
example supports Vulcan because the
developers decided to optimize their
code to run really well with certain
hardware in the Vulcan API and you know
if developers continue to optimize their
games for Vulcan then that's going to
become more of a relevant API in
comparison DirectX 12 but I feel like
this is all of these are gonna kind of
scale evenly over time I guess time
would tell if one sort of eats out the
other but to be honest I think the
memory thing is is not really relevant
because it doesn't it doesn't really
indicate future-proofing it's just a
different method of storing something in
a frame buffer and at the end of the day
developers are gonna be make
games optimized for AMD cards and NVIDIA
cards the same because if you're a video
game dev you don't want your game to
just run good on one brand of GPU
because you understand that the market
is varied but there's competition and
that a lot of your consumers at the end
of the day are gonna be running both
camps of hardware so you're gonna want
to make sure that your games are running
equally good at least equally Goods
close to equally good on both platforms
so you know I think the only time we
would start scratching our heads and
being like oh shit I think someone's in
trouble is if the competition really
gets slanted where if like let's say
Nvidia just starts dominating and AMD
sales and you know the future generation
the next generation of AMD cards is just
jack-shit for whatever reason
hypothetically speaking
then maybe devs are gonna be like well
we should probably make sure that our
games work really well on Nvidia cards
specifically because 90% of the market
is gonna be buying those but I don't
think that's necessarily the case right
now so I wouldn't be too concerned
yeah
yeah it's you and there's a lot more to
dive into for this type of I think we
need to I think we would need to clarify
that question more before giving a more
accurate answer and also difficult to
answer at the very end of our live show
when we've had more drinks so why
couldn't let it in the first thing I'll
ask I'm sorry does we couldn't give you
a more clear answer for that question
yeah but that's like an asking ask a dev
or ask ask Jensen question let's move on
to Zynga X $5 Kyle don't forget for
April Fool's Day break into Paul's house
and put all of his computers on the
floor that would be I mean I'm
definitely not considering doing that
suggested it for sure you wouldn't get
past my security system right strikes
fire $10 hi guys thanks for your videos
I'm using the Maximus X code in CRAC
Connect 62 what is the point of the a IO
pump header if you still need something
plugged into the CPU fan header Rex fire
motherboard manufacturers have made
varying connection points on their
motherboards for three pin fan heaters
four pin fan headers and those have also
been reused for pumps and different
configurations so certain motherboard
manufacturers have made headers that are
specifically designed to work with pumps
that might draw more power for example
in a lot of cases though it's really
just a labeling distinction so it just
matters for if I if I plug this into the
pump header and I go into the BIOS and I
want to adjust the say range of
operational rpms or something like that
then I know specifically if I go to
adjust the pump header and that's what
I've plugged my pump into and that's
what I know to adjust it varies from
motherboard to motherboard so it's hard
to say exactly for you but know you have
a Maximus Xcode so you have an asus
motherboard so I would say a IO pump
header is what I would plug my AOM
directly into if I have fans coming
after that I would probably plug those
into CPU fan 1 and CP fans secondary if
that's a choice or you can of course
plug those directly into the NZXT kraken
right and use the software for that to
control it's basically up to you but the
pump just you can plug into a the pump
header is the best choice just because
it's that much if even if it's just for
the simple solution of it makes it that
much easier to go into the BIOS to find
exactly where you want to adjust that if
you want to change the pump speed yeah
and and I think I would probably only
pump plug my pump into a pump header or
a header on the motherboard as opposed
to like a fan controller or something
because I feel like the bios understands
that what you've plugged into is a pump
whereas a fan controller like a third
party fan controller like Thermaltake or
something might not know and it might
not give you the proper Diagnostics on
that and additionally you might what it
seems like from your comment you say
like what's the point if you still need
something plugged into the CPU fan
header it sounds like maybe you're
getting some error message when trying
to boot if you don't have the CPU fan
header populated and that's a simple fix
in the BIOS you can just choose to
ignore the RP element because sometimes
your system won't boot properly or go
into your operating system if your CP if
it shows that your CPU fan is under a
certain rpm limit because they can oh
shit your CPU is gonna fry it's gonna
overheat you can just ignore that that
read that monitoring diagnostic and you
should be able to boot no problem so you
actually don't need something plugged
into your CPU fan header if that's what
you were referring to but thank you very
much for the donation
moving on to Titan heal bar H once again
for the $5 donation another donation I
wanted to say that Kyle has hardcore
babyface in the new egg orientation
material got a good laugh I'm the new
egg orientation material I did not
realized I was I guess they're using
your image and likeness without your
consent well that's what I sign my life
away with when I started working there
so that's
we expected but yeah you know I still
have a baby face if I were to shave all
this then I would think I was 12 and
Paul was a rapist pedophilia pedophile
weird creepy never taken advantage of
you sexually can just wait till I shave
and your sh why are those with
five-dollar keys with five dollars
Canadian donations with all this
expensive camera stuff would I or do I
need an external mic looking at the rode
videomic go or rode rode videomic pro
never use a built-in mic Andrew I would
say yes audio is often the most
overlooked aspect of video production so
doing so investments in your microphone
and especially finding out how that mic
works some mics are omnidirectional some
are directional some need to be
positioned more carefully yeah it
depends on yeah I'd say it's worth it
you're shooting set up DB chapter so
that rise in jacket you have Kyle it
looks nice how do I get me one what do I
have to who do I have to fight can I
have yours I think we're the same size I
got that at a AMD press event for Rison
yeah so did Paul right you got with you
I have one so yeah we all have one and
everywhere it there's no weight it's
really nice I love my not my style it's
not my style either but you know I work
alone apart from being with my wife he
doesn't really care too much what jacket
they were so I wear it to work sometimes
it keeps me warm in here cuz it's
freezing during the day I can't buy it
though sorry about that
maybe I'll sell mine one day for like
$1,000 $5 hey Kyle last week I got
Paul's peal box info for a possible beer
booze donation just need yours now Plus
fave beer slash booze my PA box is in
the video description of my youtube
videos just still be there or at least
in my about page on my channel and my
favorite beer or booze I like anything
that's like an IPA stout I like Browns
Reds one of those will do anything
anything surprise me surprise variety
I'm pretty open El Jefe reviews most of
El Jefe $5 sub guys missed the first
half due to overtime at work
I made it for sad be hell yeah Paul
loved the nice I love the deep cool
video though I'll PC of the month is
dope Cheers
thanks I'll jefe cheese to you brother
kilo Cruiser $10 you know I recently
built a new PC and decided to buy a hue
plus after I installed it starting
I started getting a b-side error after
and uninstalled hue and the errors went
away any idea how I can use the hue plus
without getting a B sod the driver issue
some sort something's not playing nicely
with your you plus yeah that's weird I
would try connecting it to different
connections right because the U Plus
connects via USB so you probably a
couple of several USB 2.0 ports or
headers on the motherboard so you might
be able to connect the different ones of
those and see if anything features ext
or it could just be a defective units I
mean about to if if you've verified that
the the hue plus is what's causing your
problem when it's plugged in you get be
sods when you unplug it it stops then
maybe just getting a replacement could
be could solve your problem yeah because
I I haven't had an issue similar to that
with mine either right but yeah okay
Suvarna to the 300 rupees watching the
stream at work because I wanted to catch
it live at least once in my life I think
I should I have you have now you may
live a long life full of regret
Jason H always enjoy the show need a
second opinion on this budget build with
a PC part vicar list Jason thank you
very much for the donation we don't have
time to look at the list right now but
uh maybe we can post it in chat and
people can can can tell you can can give
you some advice
that'd be great Teddy Tiger $5.00
growing up I used to visit egghead
software before they became Newegg
that's how old I am
that's a that's a misconception
misconception egghead was never
affiliated or has anything
with new affiliation no affiliation
whatsoever yeah new exits own thing egg
had something but it never but a common
mistake I also ordered it at egghead
software before I got the job at new egg
but yeah common common mistake but
they're not associated tonight I did
want to follow up on Jason at Jason HS
comments and the they build that he
linked oh yes
that's risin 5 1600 with an AZ rock X
370 killer SLI motherboard and a data
256 gig SSD looks pretty solid to me
let's CPU NZXT s340 CP uses horizon 5
1600 if you want to save somebody you
can go for a be 350 motherboard but yeah
apart from that get away with the be 350
for sure you could save 10 20 30 bucks
depending on what model you go with and
you don't need the X 370 unless you're
going with this an SLI configuration
yeah so looks pretty solid I'm ok with
it
nice case choice like the s3 45 alright
a bomb $25 origin said the 1080i runs
hot and to better cool the hardware I
recently had to spend extra $800 for a
new larger case what 850 watt power
supply 240 cooler new motherboard
because smaller one wouldn't fit so
let's hope this works
sigh whoa ok you had to spend an extra
$800 I did I would have to know what you
started with to compare I don't know 10
ATT I can run hot if it's overclocked
but it depends on what clock speed it's
running out and what muscles the same
thing donated earlier about his original
PC right oh and the cooler that you have
so yeah what that shouldn't be the case
no even if it's running really hot it's
not gonna run Wow at 40 fps
yeah if it's running that hot it's just
gonna shut down or crash it's not gonna
affect frame rates to that degree anyway
so
origen needs to get on that yeah it's a
little weird to me yeah it doesn't also
might depend on your location and how
warm it is ambient and everything but
yeah that's a tenancy I should be kind
of like the great thing is that origins
there to serve you they're like how's it
gonna continue Trevor Thompson $5 I have
an Asus GTX tiny Strix if I were to buy
a gigabyte GT X 1080 would I be able to
use them together in SLI or does the
brand matter the brand shouldn't matter
you should be able to use them in SLI
even though it'll look kind of funky in
your case but you shouldn't have any
issues it will yeah I mean yeah honestly
you should be totally fine there I can't
imagine that it would give you many
issues oh that should be on my yeah
should be on yeah yeah there are my car
keys and stuff but yeah you should be
fine with two different GTX eternities
as awkward as it might be but good luck
hey long $5.00 my r7 1,700 will do three
point nine but temperatures make me want
to go liquid was asking because eight
pin is tight on top and GPU is close on
front any additional thoughts the eight
pin is tight on top and the GPU is close
on front huh what do you mean like the 8
pin connector for your CPU is tight on
top oh I see it's tightly like you might
run into some clearance issues with like
a radiator for example um the GPU is
closed on the front yeah I don't
remember what cooler you were using hi
lung but if it's possible to just
upgrade it to a better air cooler you
shouldn't really need liquid cooling for
a risin 7 1,700 even if you're
overclocking it to 3.9 you should be
able to get away with like a pretty
mid-range cooler you might want to just
double check to see you but what your
thermal application was like and making
sure that it's mounted properly because
it's 1700 as decent of a CPU
it isn't very difficult to cool so I
don't think you need to resort to liquid
cooling in any fashion I would just
double-check your your mounting and your
thermal paste application the cooler
that you're using make sure it's the
proper TDP rated for the property BP of
that chip which is 65 watts if that's
the case then you know obviously go a
little bit over 65 watts because you'll
be overclocking but you shouldn't need
to resort to liquid that's that's a
little bit it's extra money that you'll
be spending unnecessarily unless you
just have dollars to spend Dallas to
burn a pub chef at $5 ever thought of
doing a chill stream of editing one of
your videos I just did it had three
viewers and now eight viewer so far
walls I have I have considered doing
that but I always get I always feel like
a bit self-conscious about doing
something like that because I mean for
one users get to see viewers get to see
all of my outtakes and just how many
times I say a certain line before I
actually get it right which isn't all
the time but sometimes it's like I'll do
like 20 takes just to get like the
simplest line down I'm I can be a
perfectionist at times so I guess maybe
it's just a little bit of insecurity on
my part and then the other part of it is
more insecurity like because there are
so many other people out there that are
way better at editing in Premiere Pro
than me
Taron for example from Linus tech tips
like he's just an editing god and he's
got all these macros to figure it out
and he can just like he's fully
optimized that he spent time that dude
has spent time optimizing his editing
experience for me where I've spent zero
time like I just I've been using the
same methods as I have as I have since
high school and shit thank you very much
but but maybe who knows I'm not gonna
rule it out SF SKS 11 $5 NZXT s340 elite
front hub USB port next to the vr next
to the VR not working all the other ones
are fine could you and Paul recommend a
all in USB /m SD reader
Ms Dean MSD I don't know what that is
do you know what an MSD reader is Paul
please what is your Frankie their mole
fry front hug USB port next to VR not
working multi-story multi storage device
Super Micro SD micro SD oh oh oh micro
SD reader okay rusty okay I haven't seen
it bring it like that
hmmm I don't I don't have any USB slash
micro USD reader recommendations I use a
regular SD card reader that that works
pretty good I can't think of the the
off-brand Chinese brand that that makes
it at the top of my head I have a
Kingston USB 3.0 card reader that works
pretty good yeah it's probably not the
same functionality as like the front
reader on the XS 340 elites cuz that's
pretty convenient up there yeah but yeah
I like the Kingston one yeah search
Amazon and look at the reviews Dom PCX
ten dollars okay Kyle I have a rise in
1800 X overclock to four gigahertz but I
have two gigabyte gtx 960 s and the g1
four gigabyte and i was able to
overclock both of them achieving a boost
clock for 1570 on both of them is it
still a bottleneck uh i wouldn't i
wouldn't say so
two gtx 960 s with an ex i think that's
pretty fair pairing it's kind of hard to
predict sli configurations or multi-gpu
configurations anyway because they're
gonna react differently based on the
games and have they been developed and
stuff but I don't know 1800 X is a
really solid performer 960s aren't that
powerful
so I would say you're fine yeah but
thank you for the donation dumb shader
aid once again for the five bucks I'm
getting drunk sued and stoned
hey you feel bad I gave Paul five
dollars and not you lol thank you for
the pity money I always appreciate penny
money
why is the sky blue why not and do a do
a wifey build contest where you wear
Hulk hands I don't know what Hulk hands
are other than big like Solman gloves
looks like the Hulk's hands I don't
think that build would actually happen
just because he wouldn't be able to do
anything with that situation but we do
have a similar believe it or not we have
a build coming up that's kind of in that
same thing
San Diego land $5 San Diego lana thanas
this weekend still love to see you guys
come down info at San Diego land net hit
us up and we'll do something I actually
have plans this weekend so I probably
won't be able to make it but it's been a
while since I did the land those are fun
everyone in San Diego goes to the San
Diego later thon the zoo the land do the
land dance I thank you very much San
Diego and
Sherbrooke Ali 10 bucks hey what do you
think about hacking Tasha's in general I
was in the process of loading one up
with Mac OS oh hi Sierra and I got
halfway through it all right I actually
I ran into some issues it's a lot more
complicated than it looks at least for
me my experience has been pretty rocky
I'm still planning to go through with it
but it's been put on pause for now
because it's tricky getting all the
little things to work you can I
installed the OS just fine but then
getting things like Wi-Fi or bluetooth
to work properly there's little things
that need to be nuanced so I think
hackintosh is are cool though
I think Mac's in general are super
expensive and you can you know build a
PC for a lot cheaper and still run a Mac
operating system on it that does what
you need it to I think that's great I
think Mac OS developers cheat and are
lazy by only having to develop their
plat
for a very specific episode of hardware
yeah
which makes a lot simpler for them to do
their job yep and which also makes a lot
more complex when you try to load up
their software on PC hardware PC
hardware that you've chosen out yourself
chosen yourself so I'm not surprised
when it doesn't work and the fact that
the developers of the software itself
specifically developed that with an eye
towards not wanting people to use it on
other hardware it makes me think like
alright I won't use your software then
yeah right that's where I come from just
two needs final gun use premier and I
think hackintosh azar actually even out
like technically against the term you
can't sell one Terms of Service right
yeah you can't sell one for sure yeah
yeah but they're not gonna come after
you if you do it yourself there's really
no way for them to do that much but
thank you very much for the donation
shah rukh next we've got tighten heel
bar again ten bucks tidy a bar back
again with another donation again giving
cows in love I seriously hope you bring
me a mousepad I will hug you in the CS
Center with no shame I will I will
molest you with this mouse pad no I
didn't say that one stream I will throw
this beer now beer stains mouse pad
mouse pad smells very it's very potent
yeah I don't like it
thank you very much Titan high along
$5.00 I'm running the Wraith spire I'll
read you the thermal app and see how it
goes the CPU voltage is one point four
five four three point nine stable on the
1700 which is giving me 96 degrees
Celsius under load voltage is a little
higher than I would want to run with
24/7 yeah that's super high that's pro
like you either have a bad CPU or you're
just over volting it more than you need
to turn to one point for one point for
one it's also one of those things where
it's like you know some seventeen
hundreds just can't run at that
frequency mm-hmm
yeah you know maybe you can maybe you
can coax it into doing that for a short
period of time with a really high
voltage
and adequate cooling but practically
speaking shoot for three points yes just
three point eight it's fine dramatically
you'll be happier in the end and even
consider double check and even consider
what your 1700 is doing at stock because
at stock with XFR when it's only trying
to push one or two cores up to a higher
frequency sometimes you can hit three
point eight three point nine even four
gigahertz and going with a more brute
force manual overclock to tell it to be
like no do three point nine all the time
can actually keep it from doing that for
four gigahertz on a couple cores from
time to time which can improve your
gaming performance depending on the game
that you're you play so sometimes as
much as as much fun as it is to
overclock a Rison processor and as is
you know
open as AMD is with the different
chipsets that enable and everything
sometimes it makes more sense just to
run stock yeah but thank you very much
hi long and finally we have Paul C from
the five bucks I have an i-5 30 39 60 X
on an Asus x79 saber-toothed tough what
kind of performance increase what I see
in upgrading to something more current
gen ah that's a good question
it's hard to answer that specifically
but Paul I can tell you at this point
you will notice a difference huge I'm
not gonna quantify it I'm not gonna tell
you here's where you'll find this
difference of that difference a lot you
will see a difference instructions for
clock has improved dramatically since
the i7 and 3960 x days and if you get
something that's a equivalent number of
cores and threads or better you'll see a
performance increase and you also see
performance increase from capability of
doing stuff like an nvme SSD and that
kind of thing so don't get me wrong here
39 60 X is still perfectly viable so if
if it's doing the job for you then then
hang out on that a little bit longer but
you will notice a difference if you
upgrade big-time thank you very much
Dom PCX $5 also last question
as your opinion on Unreal Engine 4 do
you think it will be taxing on older
hardware and possibly make anything
below a 6 Series obsolete it's hard to
say because you're just talking about
Unreal Engine 4 that's an engine there's
lots of different things that can be
done with that engine there's lots of
different textures it can be imported of
different sizes that might take up more
or less memory so yes it will be taxing
on older hardware I would like I won't
say it would make anything below a six
years obsolete but below a six series
you'll probably have to lower GPU or at
lower graphical settings or maybe turn
down anti-aliasing or other things in
order to get an acceptable frame rate
but yeah okay very very low last very
last donation five dollars but no I
think this is from Gatorade once again
oh hey my r5 2400 G is stable at 4.1
gigahertz for everything except a 264
stress test if I use the cash test it
says Hardware fail every time but fine
without I'd be okay with that stress
tests often do stuff that you would
never ever encounter outside of a stress
test so yeah if you're okay everywhere
else then I would be okay failing just
that stress test but if you have
instability elsewhere then you might
consider dialing stuff back yeah I
refuse
all right Johnson's here Johnson's Eric
for picking up a CPU cooler a navy blue
t-shirt thank you very much Johnson to
you sir I have one Johnson for Jeff from
Texas he got the black Trev lend them
screw shirt Thank You Jeff Johnson
frederique rip gamepad Thank You
Frederick for being the second person to
pick up that shirt sergio BIOS flash
shirt Johnson to Sergio and then finally
we've got one from Jeffrey that's a
double G on so that's different bit with
gray logo black tribe and tri-blend
t-shirt guys thank you so much for
