on I don't see the stream starting on my
end yet so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
keep talking until it pops up which
would be any second now
eh there we go
hello hello and welcome this is a live
stream that's right that's it's because
I'm too lazy to make an actual serious
video so weird go live stream this year
yeah this this this whole video will be
live streamed hello everyone as the
title suggests we're gonna recap I'm
gonna briefly go over the the e3
announcements that AMD made just
recently earlier today and they had a
lot of juicy details about Navi a lot of
stuff about rising 3,000 most of it that
we already kind of knew so yeah I just I
just wanted to sort of recap it for you
guys in case you missed it and just sort
of go through the what I thought were
the more important bits of the stream
and and just shed a little little light
on it
how's that sound sounds good looks like
I'm seeing no real heinous complaints
about bad audio or video so I'm assuming
that we're good and I say we just jump
into it I started on this lovely freeze
frame of Lisa sue CEO of AMD because you
could just tell by getting this moment
she's got it she's like meditating she's
like this this is the moment I've been
waiting for this is when we dropped the
bomb on Intel alright and and
potentially potentially NVIDIA okay
there's this competition on both fronts
for for good ol AMD so yeah sorry Lyles
not here you guys can ride and chat
about that I
I'm actually not sorry I shouldn't say
I'm sorry when I'm not yeah I got to be
better about that I'm not sorry okay
hopefully you guys can be here alright
so she's starting off with the bull then
to recap here 50% IPC uplift a lot of
focus on cash with this this new
architecture and twice before
I'm not gonna make her too loud because
I'm gonna be changing her volume quite a
bit whenever I want to talk over her
it's coming nice to be able to talk over
the CEO of AMD whenever I want to I feel
I feel very powerful right now so here's
here's a nice stack here's look at this
stack 3700 X at 329 that's gonna compete
with the 9600 K yep slight audio delay
how much of the way a little bit all
right I'm gonna try to fix the delay as
best I can
but I don't know if it's gonna work the
thinking about audio delay is that I
might have to stop I have to end the
stream and restart it which I don't know
I'm not really willing to do because I
just know how that goes unless it's
super bad yeah some people are saying
there's really not that much of a delay
so I'm gonna push on forward okay you
guys are making me miss Lisa Sue's
well-thought-out presentation okay all
right so we've got the 3,800 X 4 399
that's 8 core 16 thread as well it's
kind of interesting we've got you know
to eight cores 16 thread CPUs 3700 X and
3,800 X right here back to back but then
for $4.99 you get the 12 core 24 thread
CPU which competes I guess directly
against the 99 60 X or I'm sorry the 99
the 99 20x from Intel their core I 9
which is $1200 mind you it's more than
double the price of the 3900 X which is
a risin 9 also it's also an
industry-first for AMD risin 9 so I
think there's a demo up here somewhere
that's insane oh yeah so they're showing
that there's this performance benefit to
have over Intel with a 3900 X when you
compare it to the 99 20x which is much
more expensive insane power savings like
the efficiency on these chips is nuts
and that's partly due to 7 nanometre the
process string and a bunch of other
factors that they've done yes less than
half the price I see that smirky smile
of yours Lisa sue I would be doing the
same
it's well-earned well-earned smirk
right what now I'll let her talk a
little bit let me show you let me show
you first some data and here we compare
the 3900 X again now versus the 9900 K
okay and this is across some of the top
triple-a gaming titles this is in 1080p
so obviously these you know these should
be taken with a grain of salt because
their manufacturer benchmarks and even
still it kind of looks like the 9900
case still has the IPC bump over over
AMD but Amy's definitely closing the gap
so much to the point where it's not
really a good selling point for Intel at
this point you know you're getting more
cores you're getting more more
scalability with the platform you can
upgrade between you know Ford's forwards
and backwards compatibility overclocking
on all CPUs on all motherboards you know
within within reason there's just a very
little very little that Intel's riding
on right now with this launch it's crazy
this could really turn things around
even more Robert a little bit all right
gotta love the onstage keynote
camaraderie between between corporate
officials 120 Hertz monitor on my desk
1440p is where I play I hear some cheers
down there you know got a flex on this
Robert we trust you we know you're cool
impress me so let's take a look at Tom
Clancy's division 2 running at 1440p
just hit world tier 5 myself gear score
503 if anybody else plays hit me up
right and what you see is a very
comparable gaming experience but what
you really see is the rising 9 3900 X
this beautiful monstrously powerful 12
core CPU delivering an incredible gaming
experience so yeah they're testing it
1440p sure I mean it would have been
more CPU bound and really shown a bigger
difference I think had they dumped it
down to 1080p but I think this is more
of a realistic test all things
considered because if you're spending
four or five hundred dollars on a CPU
you're probably not going to game at
1920 by
1080 unless you're really you're just
chasing the you know the 1440p I'm sorry
chasing the 144 Hertz refresh or
something like that but honestly is a
pretty good comparison
it looks like the 9900 K on average is
still edging out the competition
slightly edging out rate AMD slightly
but again it's so it's so negligible
here okay I don't really like this
comparison because he does a streaming
comparison here streaming to YouTube
10000 kilobits per second does anyone
know one stream at 10000 kilobits per
second I mean I get that that you can do
it compute computers can do it you can
handle it but can our viewers actually
watch actually watch it at that
resolution or that bitrate feasibly it's
kind of like right forcing viewers to
watch 8 K but it is a very telling demo
saying that it's a very telling demo
demonstrating that you know there's a
bit more future proofing here I guess
when when like say streaming eventually
scales to that level yeah like you guys
are saying like usually 4000 kilobits
per second on Twitch is like good spot
so a bit of an excessive demo but
definitely shows the power of the I
think you need a 12 core processor for
gaming it's nice to have look at the
rise in 730 800 X in action you know my
point earlier was that at every price
point we're giving gamers something
special and this time so this is the 8
core 3800 x7k across the same titles in
1080p and what do you see again kind of
the same trend here right hey I think
Intel's edging them out a little bit and
if these are somewhat skewed benchmarks
because they're manufactured benchmarks
then I would assume that IPC is still
favoring Intel but again they're hot on
their heels a
he is hot on their heels my friends
surprising seven stack
you said it Lisa but look I said I have
something for everyone so now let's turn
to the rising five stock and frankly
there are a lot of piece of users who
might have a budget of let's call it two
hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars
so yeah I mean that they look at the
data they look at research and stuff
right and they they go okay most people
want the twelve core the most the hype
is around the 12 core
maybe the eight core but the budgets the
wallets the realistic scenario is that
most people are spending two to $250 on
a CPU so here it is this is the sweet
spot for rising three thousand thirty
six hundred and thirty six hundred x
very attractive price points here at
both six core twelve thread all right
you still get to all that SMT goodness
higher clock speeds out of the box with
the XQ as always and they're comparing
it to the 9600 9600 K here which again I
think better bang for the buck on AMD
side but just absolute raw performance
maybe going to Intel I'll show you
rising five for the first time alright
bringing Robert back the bringing Robert
back holy crap hold the phone I'm gonna
get a twelve core processor but it's
also true that most customers buy a $250
CPU that's what people can afford and so
our job is to give you the best hey who
you callin people it sounded racist
fifty dollars maybe maybe I'm a person
that could afford $80 CPU you don't know
that title that requires hundreds of
frames per second we're gonna show you
side by side our csgo
dollars CPU with six cores and twelve
threads versus theirs and again ok I see
a very comparable gaming experience
upwards of 300 frames a second and any
csgo player will tell you that every
frame counts because if you're trying to
360 noscope want someone every frame
matters so he made a 360 noscope
reference legit gamer head you're
getting an amazing I'm scared gaming
experience
Roberts great guy
nice price and that all right so we get
it 3,600 ex still free bangin bangin
value there's the whole stack right
there let's get let's get one more shot
of that alright so you can see that big
difference here with rising 3000 is
compared to previous generations that
they're really targeting a much wider
range of price points pretty much all up
and down the line from 200 all the way
up to 500 and maybe maybe even beyond
that - who knows but there's certainly
more more ground that they're covering
alright but you know yes it's time to go
to the other half of the ultimate game
platform and now it's time to talk about
Navi our next-generation GPU ah Feliz
Navidad here we go
Oh God again with the teaser videos like
we get it we're we're already hyped for
it you don't need to spend extra
marketing dollars on this garbage come
on just get to the
it's very very attractive look at the
graphics
that retraced
nope it's not knobby it's not it's not
very traced there will be no ray tracing
at Navi no heart bear
but they're gonna wait til the
industry's ready for matrix which i
think is a
if I hear one more comment about Lyle in
the comments you will never see him
again
die just shake the business
yes you already know we are all right
I'm gonna skip around here seven
nanometer they're using a whole new
architecture built from the ground up
seven nanometer our DNA is what they're
calling it there's been a huge emphasis
again on cash they're looking for faster
clock speeds with lower power so overall
better efficiency that's it that's it
Lyle is never coming back you guys you
guys just killed Lyle I hope you're
happy
you know shame on you
you're your own monster really your own
worst enemy okay keep going Lisa you're
doing great
streamlined graphics pipeline okay
here's the reveal here's the reveal of
the actual card you guys probably
already seen it floating around but
here's the reference rx 550 700 XT Oh
oh it looks like a blower are they are
they blowing us AMD's going for the blow
all right
okay that
so shiny all right so I actually heard
that they decided to go with the blower
style shroud for their reference design
to keep the cards performance consistent
if people are gonna be buying the
reference GPU they want it to be
consistent because it's it's gonna have
its own little self-contained cooler
it's gonna exhaust hot air out the back
of the chassis it's not gonna circulate
it within the case like for example the
founders edition cards from video well
and since there's no guarantee as to
what kind of chassis users are gonna be
putting this card inside AMD's arguments
there their whole pitch for blower style
card is that it's just gonna offer more
consistent temperatures performance
noise and all that sort of thing across
the board so whether you agree with that
statement or not yeah you know it's it's
still a blower card they've they've you
know as always they say it's it's much
quieter it's like quiet to the point
where it's not even a problem but
they've said that many times in the past
many companies have and and time and
time again they're usually wrong we'll
see how this stacks up and if it is
quiet then what what are the
temperatures look like you know
something's got to give somewhere
the redditors all right so specs here
for the 5700 xt 4 compute units 9.75
teraflops 8 gigs of GD d are six people
some people were speculating that there
might be more but i think 8 gigs is this
is enough i mean it's enough for now
some a little extra Headroom would have
been fine but you know it's it's fast G
to the r6 memory now we have an
interesting new clock speed here a new
metric seventeen hundred and fifty five
megahertz game clock what the heck is a
game clock so there's still bass clock
you know it's sort of like your nominal
sort of you know fundamental starting
point six hundred sixteen hundred and
five and then you have a boost clock
which is gonna you the the cards gonna
target that when it sees fit
you know when thermal and power
limitations are are paving the way for
it the gates open and that's going to be
okay
Spike's it's not gonna be sustained at
at nineteen hundred and five megahertz
it'll hit that whenever it can to give
you this just a little bit of boost
there but a game clock from what I
understand what AMD's told us us press
is that this is sort of like a semi
guaranteed clock speed of what your
cards gonna be able to hit in a
particular game or in in any game really
now they did say there's exceptions to
every rule and that occasionally you
might see some title here and there
actually dip below that but they said
for the most part that's that's sort of
what to expect your GPU to run at at a
minimum regardless of of what game
you're playing they also mentioned that
you know just with the boosting
algorithm that that they have in the
card that most of the time you're gonna
see the clock speed actually somewhere
in between the game clock in the boost
clock so you might see somewhere in
between you know eighteen hundred and
sixty megahertz or something like that
sustained so it's it's kind of
interesting there was there are many
questions circulating around what the
heck game clock is and why it is who it
is what's its motive but you can also
see here the the pin layouts one one six
one six and one eight pin so you get a
one eight one six and it's the same on
the RX 5700 so but but the TDP s are
slightly different obviously obviously
slightly slightly higher for the xt
model vapor chamber cooling it's got a
weird contour in the shroud itself
that's supposed to help with acoustics
but it really just kind of looks like
someone made a dent in the card if you
look at certain images maybe even the
one in the thumbnail of this video it
looks like there's like someone like
someone punched the card and there's
like a little dent in it looks a little
weird but you know if it helps things
functionally then i guess it's it's
worth it it's hard to sort of measure
that though so they have a little test
going on here our TX 2070 versus the rx
5700 XT 1440p this is World War Z I
believe and it's kind of hard to see
okay yeah you definitely get some uplift
there obviously grain of salt we don't
really know the full testing conditions
amazing result a hunt nice little uplift
there versus our competitors 102 frames
per second what do you think about that
what do you think about that what do you
think about that I like all these people
on the red Radeon shirts we're not
biased at all because comes from our
heart we've just taken the best score
from each of the GPU manufacturers and
we said put the best versus the best so
that way there's no trickery and you can
see that in its class in the $409 class
the RX 5700 xt beats the competition and
beast it consistently all right show us
those benchmarks one more time okay
let's go back here did you hear that you
guys catch what you're saying they're
areas okay so in the red you've got the
5700 XT and then the gray is the 20 of
the r-tx 20 70 now what he said was
these are what they're calling best -
best benchmarks and you can kind of see
the description here on the left side
best performance API for both GPUs at
max quality so basically what that means
is they tested both cards presumably on
all the API is that they could as long
as the game whatever title supported it
and then whatever the the highest number
regardless of API was they put that on
the graph so you might be looking at a
DirectX 12 result for for the r-tx 2070
here in Metro Exodus but then you're
looking at potentially a Vulcan score
for your for your rx 5700 XT so that's
it's very clear I want to make that very
clear as transparent as possible it's
nice that they did list that on the side
there but you know it's it's not
necessarily apples to apples as as
vanilla as you could make it but you
know it's an interesting kind of way to
certainly done you know obviously with
the hopes of favoring ad I don't think
they would have chosen that benchmarking
method unless it looked better on on the
grass for them
trickery and you can see that in its
class no trickery stop your black magic
okay
fifty-seven hundred so this is the non
XT slightly more affordable card we'll
get to prices at the end 36 compute
units seven point nine five teraflops
still pretty respectable you still
retain eight gigs of GTD are six so you
can see this either way like oh you
don't get any more memory there your
frame buffer is the same size if you
scale up to the XT or you could look at
it what at the opposite way you know the
glass is half-full where's like oh you
don't lose any memory if you go down to
the 5709 XT so take your pick
seventeen hundred and twenty five
megahertz boost that's sixteen hundred
and twenty five megahertz game clock and
fourteen sixty five megahertz base so
again we're gonna be hovering most of
the time if this is all to be true
somewhere between sixteen hundred and
twenty five and seventeen hundred and
twenty five megahertz sustained wall
under load of course manually
overclocking how does it compete against
your competitors
I was later manic thanks for popping in
so this is supposed to be a really one
of the most demanding things you can do
in apex Legends is to throw this grenade
and yeah so apparently that tanks the
frame rate pretty well and so they did a
quick benchmark here
72 to 88 kind of interesting would have
liked to see just an apex benchmark like
playing you know a match or like running
through the same part of a map that
might have been a bit more realistic but
okay so 1440p benchmarks again these are
best - best benchmarks depending on that
are reliant on the best api between each
card so now they're comparing the RX
5700 to the RT x 2060 the game the games
look pretty good here yeah you can
definitely see metro is like killing it
here because of wolken in battlefield
battlefield 5 is also
doing pretty good there because I wanted
to get you excited about how much we put
in just in terms of raw performance all
that kind of new gaming so much excite
with our DNA yep we got out and also
first first gaming GPU to really support
PCI Express 4.0 right out of the box
that may not have the biggest
application in gaming surprise like
ironically for a gaming card to have it
gaming is probably the last thing that
PCIe gen 4 is gonna benefit it's more so
super fast storage you know if you've
got a bunch of PCIe Gen 4 nvme SSDs for
example in a raid setup you can really
take advantage of that bandwidth or if
you're editing they actually showed us a
demo am needed of a 8k editing workflow
and just just just general playback was
a lot smoother being able to utilize
that PCI agent for bandwidth then say on
channel 3 so I guess if you're a really
high-end content creator then it might
come in handy
but for gaming not a whole lot not a
whole lot of dividends to be had there
alright fidelity FX is their open source
sort of image quality development tool
so they're putting this on GPU open so
that devs can have their way with it and
implement it into their games which
means that this feature isn't going to
be available on every game the developer
has to choose to integrate it but it's
it's kind of interesting it basically
changes like the contrast of certain
textures in-game certain scenes so that
it brings out more detail they become
more crisp and here's a before-and-after
off on the left on on the right you can
kind of see on the asphalt there it
looks a bit more detailed certainly
looks a bit less blurry and you can even
tell on the wheel maybe not as much this
is a very subtle thing that could go a
long way depending on the game that
you're in but I think the biggest thing
here is that there's very little
performance kind of
see I mean I think they were saying and
csgo for example they went from like 153
to 151 FPS it's it's pretty marginal
it's definitely one of a one of those
subjective things to some people are
gonna prefer it on others are probably
gonna like it off here's another example
before and after with Borderlands 3
again very subtle change here that I
guess depending on your own individual
eyes and the game itself might have a
bigger impact or a smaller impact but
very little performance impact yes
there's the AMD fanboys again so if you
that they kind of have some other
alternative here if if game developers
aren't putting fidelity effects into the
games they actually have AMD Radeon
image sharpening or are is this is gonna
be supported on pretty much any game
it's kind of like an automatic thing
that you can just turn on regardless of
game because it's it's actually a
function that's built into the driver
the Radeon drivers so you don't need to
wait for a dev to put it in the game you
can just fire it up yourself it all just
works on the fly it just works
it just works and it essentially does
the same thing you know enhances
contrast makes things a bit look a bit
more detail on the surface and this is
just a nice graph showing the the
performance the performance impact I
mean you're still getting 90 98 to 99
percent of the frames that you would be
if you had turned the feature off talk
about anti anti legs probably one of the
coolest features that they're rolling
out to a server when you're playing an
eSports game is one of the most
frustrating things and so we took a look
at that said how can we improve the lag
between the GPU and the monitor and one
way to do that is to take a look at how
we deliver the software from the GPU to
the monitor and see if we can
to get some of that lag this is the
feature to do that for you
and what I'd like to do is bring Robert
back up on the stage explain a lot about
the deaf third time and 3p gamers are
gonna love it Rob are you doing this guy
I just get so tired walking so gamer is
all these wheelchair kebab getting
higher frames per second because that
reduces input lag or the time between
clicking a mouse or pressing a button
and that's showing up on the screen
there's a name for that it's called
motion to photon latency click a button
straight in your eyeballs at 60 frames a
second two photon latency about four
frame MTPA of lag four frames that's a
lot so let's show two systems with the
radio or 100x T versus the r-tx 2070
both running at around 60 frames a
second and in green you can see did that
motion of photon latency it's about 57
milliseconds from the time you press a
button on your mouse your keyboard to
the time it comes out of the monitor
into your eyes driving what comes on to
the monitor and into your eyes excu back
up for a second oh whoa Robert the frame
Yuva from the unstained you're welcome
on today lower even at the same frame
rate so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna enable Radeon anti-lag and you'll
see that on the RF 9700 XT you're gonna
give us the before and after Robert
about 40 how much are we getting input
lag look at that which is a full frame
frame and a half of improvement without
over what you would have without this
feature so if you're looking for that
competitive advantage in DotA League
csgo where every frame matters okay so
this is obviously gonna vary its
effectiveness from gamer to gamer I
think you really have to be into eSports
and have fast responsiveness in general
fast reaction times to benefit from this
like I'm a terrible gamer like I
wouldn't even notice if it was like one
lag one one frame or two frames of lag
of difference it wouldn't make much of a
difference to me but there are a lot of
gamers out there who would benefit from
this and the way it essentially works is
anti lag is is targeting GPU bound
scenarios mostly when the CPU is kind of
just twiddling its thumbs waiting for
the GPU and then when the GPU finally
catches up well the CPU it sort of drags
the CPU down with it
so that that motion to photon latency is
increased and the amount of time that
you actually see a keystroke or a mouse
click registered on your screen is
delayed because the GPUs held up so they
what they essentially do is they they
kind of like sync both the the CPU and
the GPU instructions so they can run
them side by side work on the same frame
or whatever to effectively reduce the
the amount of lag by like you said up to
a frame or two depending so it's kind of
interesting the other thing about that
is that you are gonna incur a little bit
of a performance hit but it's again so
slight again I think they were saying
like 100 and 140 down to like 138 it's
it's pretty negligible oh oh geez I'm
completely missing the price here so all
right so for 49 for the 500 XT and 379
for the non XT these are directly
competing with the rx r-tx 2060 and 2070
cards now let's let's talk about these
prices here there's been a lot of mixed
reactions so far I even did a Twitter
poll and actually let me check on that
Twitter poll let me see how it's doing
right now give me that tweet asks hey
can I just put this up look at that look
at that all right so so far thirty three
hundred thirty three hundred votes have
have rolled in so far and it looks like
most you are somewhere in between being
impressed and underwhelmed but it seems
like the majority of you I would say
between those two camps are happy with
the pricing 30% impressed versus 60 19%
underwhelmed and I think I'm somewhere
in the in-between group myself I think
you know like someone said in on Twitter
these prices are good they seem fair but
they're not so competitive to the point
where Nvidia couldn't retaliate very
easily you know there's been speculation
that they might be releasing more r-tx
cards maybe there will be like a 20 60
TI or 2070 TI
and that could theoretically shift the
pricing of their existing r-tx cards
down to be more competitive with na'vi
so it remains to be seen and I felt like
the whole time
when we were getting briefed on on na'vi
earlier this weekend we just kept going
well it sounds good you know everything
that you're saying sounds good but we
got to know the price we got another
part because they didn't reveal the
price to us during the event I found out
the same time you guys did on this
livestream so we all just kept saying
well it just depends on the price and
now that we know the price it's like
well it's kind of kind of depends on the
performance because you know again grain
of salt here we have to wait and see
what the reviews are gonna show us my
own review included and and really see
how competitive the performances with
the are txseries cards that they're
going up against that'll determine how I
feel how we all feel I think in the end
with with the pricing here but there's
hope these prices aren't out of line you
know you wouldn't look at them and go oh
well there's just there's no way that
they can make this work so we'll have to
wait and see you know there's there
could be some other weird thing throwing
off the GPUs maybe it's got some
overheating issues or some acoustic
problems that are uncomplete ly
unforeseen I'm just speculating here I
have no idea but assuming the
performance is where it should be I
think we have a pretty good chance of of
kind of having decent competition
because right now the r-tx 2070 is going
for about 500 bucks I was looking on
Newegg earlier today you can't really
find it for much cheaper than 500 bucks
so the 4:49 price point I think is is
actually the more impressive one for the
for the xt model for the 5700 xt because
you're undercutting nvidia by 50 bucks
but the RT x 2060 i think is a bit more
competitively priced you can find one
for around 350 340 u.s. dollars
depending on where you look and that
that's obviously lower than what the
MSRP is for the 5700 so we'll just have
to wait and see we'll just have to wait
and see won't we but that's pretty much
all I got for now guys because at this
point they just start rambling on about
games which I get its e3 you're supposed
to talk about games but we don't we
don't really care too much about that I
mean we do but not not for the sake of
this video so guys that is going to be
my lazy lazy stream for today that's
going to conclude it thanks so much for
watching I will make
sure that I kill while right after this
so that you guys never get to see him
again because you broke my rule of
talking about him in chat and I'm just a
little salty that you guys would choose
him over me but screw all of you thank
you very much again and I'll see you
guys very soon let me know what you
think in the comments if you're watching
this either right now or after the fact
let me know what your expectations are
for na'vi and rise in 3000 as well guys
thanks so much for watching have a go
and i'll see you guys later all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
