channel today we are taking a look at
the entry level or the cheapest SKU in
the rising family which is the r7 1700
if you guys missed my 1800 X versus 6900
tape video go ahead and check that out
I'll put it in a card somewhere but this
is more so about that entry-level r7
chip that a lot of you guys are probably
going to have your eyes on because it is
at a lower price point of just three
hundred and thirty dollars MSRP that is
us and that pricing also puts it right
in line to compete with intel's kb lakes
core i7 7700 k which is their flagship
chip within that family so we're going
to be stacking those two chips up
against each other today in a series of
seven different games to really get an
idea of which one is the better deal or
best bang for your buck if you are going
to be building purely a gaming PC now
the specs of the 1700's interestingly
enough are very similar to that of the
1800 X but obviously for significantly
cheaper we still got the 8 core 16
thread count the combines 20 megabytes
of l2 and l3 cache the only two big
things that are different here between
those two chips is the out-of-the-box
frequency so we're seeing a base clock
of three gigahertz with a boost of 3.7
on the 1700 and a 65 watt TDP that's
significantly lower them a 95 watt TDP
of the 1800 X which is already a lot
lower than something like the 69 hundred
K so hopefully we're going to be able to
take a look at thermals just a little
bit later on in this video and see just
how much cooler this chip is then say
the 7700 K especially we're going to be
overclocking both of those speaking of
overclocking I was curious to see what
kind of frequency we could hit with our
1700 by tweaking things in the BIOS and
sure enough we were able to hit 4.0
gigahertz at one point 3 6 5 volts if
you remember in the 1800 x video I did a
stock V core of that ship is 1.35 so I
decided to dial it in a little bit
further this time around because I
really wanted that nice even 4 gigahertz
mark and we were able to do it it's
rock-solid stable if you're willing to
dial in a manual overclock you can
probably get similar performance with
the 1700s as you can with the 1800 X as
we see from this 4 gigahertz overclock
as well as the gaming results were about
to see in a bit as from 7700 K being the
overclocking champ that it is we were
able to take that to 5 gigahertz quite
easily with about 1.4 to 1.41 volts in
the
BIOS so that was all fine and dandy
let's go ahead and take a look at some
of our testing hardware on the AMD
testbed I'm using the exact same
hardware that I did on the 1800 X setup
with the exception of the CPU of course
we've got that knocked to a cooler that
was provided to me by AMD themselves as
well as the MSI X power gaming titanium
on the 370 X chipset we've also got 16
gigs of Corsair Vengeance lpx ddr4 3000
as well as a GTX 1080 founders Edition
running at stock frequencies our boot
drive is the SX 900 from a data that's a
512 gig disk and our power supply is a
1600 watt unit from lleva for our 7700 K
Intel testbed we're using a hyper 212
turbo from Coolermaster as our air
cooler both of these coolers by the way
their fans were maxed to 100% throughout
the entirety of today's tests we've also
got a z2 70 gaming Pro carbon
motherboard from MSI same memory and
same graphics card as our AMD testbed
that's all being duplicated here HX 750
watt unit from corsair and a one
terabyte rd 400 SSD from OCZ this thing
is blazing fast but it's not going to
give us an advantage in terms of frame
rates or gaming performance over the SSD
the SATA 3 SSD so just bear that in mind
it's just going to lead to reduced
loading times and things of that nature
but those are pretty much all the specs
of what we're using today I did want to
mention that we're also using the latest
Nvidia driver which is three seven eight
six six additionally all seven of the
games I ran today were tested at 1920 by
1080 I threw out 1440p and 4k benchmarks
altogether because I'm trying to
eliminate any sort of GPU bottlenecking
across the board and that's just going
to help us determine which of these CPUs
is actually the better deal I know a lot
of you guys who are gaming at hyper 1080
resolutions interested in getting the
1700 are really just curious to see what
kind of frame rates you can get at those
pixel counts however the only way we're
going to expose weaknesses between these
chips is by tailoring our benchmark
environment to be primarily CPU bound so
hopefully that makes sense I didn't
quite have time to test all the
resolutions so you'll forgive me for
being a one-man crew maybe that's
something we can do in a follow-up video
on that note why don't we go ahead and
jump into our first benchmark which is
doom and the superb sets the stage here
with the 7700 K pulling ahead of the
1700 pretty much on the average frame
rates as well as
low-end 99.9% I'll we actually saw a 9%
lead with average FPS going from 179 on
the 1700 to 195 at these on the 7700 K
and that trend sort of continues with
the low-end numbers as well we see a
similar result take hold in ashes of the
singularity with average frame rates for
the 7700 K being sixty six point six
compared to be fifty nine point eight on
the 1700 which gives us an 11 point
three percent gain on the Intel flagship
KT Lake unfortunately I don't have any
1% or 0.1% lows for you guys in this
test particularly because fraps wasn't
recording properly while I was running
the preset benchmark but this still
gives us a pretty clear indication of
the IPC lead that we've got with the
7700 K in battlefield one the 1700 keeps
pace very nicely with the 7700 K you can
see here we've got identical frame rates
on average as well as one percent load
there was a slight dip on the 1700's
0.1% lows but overall not too bad very
smooth gameplay experiences across both
platforms I really couldn't tell the
difference and battlefield 1 is one of
the more recent titles in today's suite
of benchmarks that's heavily optimized
for multiple threads and cores so I
think those extra four cores and eight
threads on the 1700 are really working
in its favor
for this particular test on the other
hand leave it to GTA 5 at 1080p to
expose any weaknesses of a particular
chip we see just an absolute crushing
victory here with the 7700 K yielding 93
average our 93 frames per second on
average which is a 31% gain over what
the 1700 was able to achieve at just 71
fps and the 1% in point one percent lows
obviously reflect this as well it's kind
of interesting because GTA 5 is such a
heavily threaded application yet we're
seeing such lackluster performance with
the 1700 which has obviously more cores
and threads at its disposal I think a
small explanation for this is that we're
just seeing a more refined architecture
at this point in the game from Intel as
we are from AMD because I mean if you
think about it Rison has been in the
works for four years now which means
they started developing Rison you know
in 2013 and I think just the fact that
Intel has been reiterating their
architecture every year or two really
has allowed them to just get into the
groove as opposed to a
m.d still trying to find their footing i
think that could in some small way
explain what's going on here and again
we're seeing this trend continue here in
Metro last light with the 7700 K
yielding 11% more frames per second on
average than the 1,700 and we're getting
pretty low 1% and 0.1% loads as well
which do you indicate a little bit of
choppiness
for our AMD chip here and hopefully we
can see some big improvements on this
end in the next six months to a year
moving forward because of their press
event two weeks ago AMD was very adamant
about working more closely with game
developers big game developers very
similarly to how they and NVIDIA already
do that on the graphic side of things
AMD wants to bring their CPU
architecture to the game developers in
order to optimize games more heavily for
multi-threaded applications so who's to
say when exactly that's going to happen
and what kind of impact that's going to
make in the long run but it is something
to look forward to now so far in our
tests we have managed to avoid any
instances of GPU bottlenecking as
intended however here we have a CPU idle
neck with overwatch at 1080p simply
because we've got a GTX 980 and this
game is just not very intensive to begin
with so that's why we see a very minimal
gap across the board between both of our
chips we can safely assume that if we
were to crank up the resolution and once
again put put a load on the GPU that we
would probably start to see that gap
widen in favor of the 7700 K the last
game that we tested was watchdogs too
and this is also a title that scales
very heavily on all the cores we saw an
average frame rate of 84 with our 7700 K
and an average FPS of 78 on our 1700
which gives us a total lead of 7.7% of
course for Intel and actually this
particular test is fairly representative
of the overall average frame rates
rendered across all seven of our games
with the 7700 K rendering 127 FPS on
average and the 1,700 yielding 118 given
these figures we can use basic maths to
deduce that the 1700 on average rendered
7% fewer frames than the 7700 K and if
you factor in pricing the 1700 is only
three percent cheaper so in that and
that's at the MSRP of three hundred and
thirty dollars so if we're to draw some
conclusions based on these numbers I
think the data really speaks for itself
and my takeaway from these results is
that if you
are in the market for a gaming PC and
you're building it today and you need it
right now
and that PC is strictly for gaming
you're not video editing you're not
encoding you're not live-streaming
you're just gaming and you need it today
then the 7700 K is the better value as
we saw you're going to be rendering out
seven to seven and a half percent more
frames on average than the 1,700 and
you're only paying ten to twenty bucks
more depending on where you get it of
course but overall I think that's worth
it however what I said about the 1800 X
also applies to the 1700 and that is if
you're building a PC that split right
down the middle
you're gonna be gaming half the time and
video editing doing works to workstation
stuff live streaming the other half of
the time then the 1700 is the better
option I would say I would probably
recommend I would definitely recommend
it if you are going to be doing sort of
a jack-of-all-trades scenario where
multi-threaded heavily multi-threaded
applications that are non gaming related
are going to be thrown into the mix so
that is where one area where the 1700's
really does shine and it is quite a deal
because I think on the Intel side of
things if you were to up to a six core
twelfth read part that could compete
with that in that same space you'd be
looking at the 6800 K which is at least
around $100 more maybe a little bit you
know eighty to a hundred dollars more
than 17-hundred alternatively if you
don't need a gaming PC right now I would
highly suggest waiting to see what other
rising SKUs will be offering once they
launch because we don't know exactly
what the price points will be we know
that they'll be more aggressively priced
than the current stack of our seven
chips those might fall more in line with
your expectations and needs also we just
don't know like I was mentioning earlier
where the architecture where the rise in
architecture is headed with AMD working
more closely with game developers who
knows we could see sort of like an AR X
480 thing or even though that's more
driver implement implemented how the
performance of the AR X 480 has just
kind of skyrocketed since it launched
because there's been all these
iterations to the drivers similarly we
may eventually see some nice performance
gains from Verizon as AMD continues
working more closely with game
developers and and sharing their cpu
architecture with them in order to
develop games more tailored for higher
core and thread counts but I think
that's pretty much going to do it for
now guys let me know what you think of
