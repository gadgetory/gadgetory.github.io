RGB waterblock let's install it that's
that's all we're doing today the thermal
take a 500 aluminum TG mid tower
features a sleek aluminum front panel
and two four millimeter tempered glass
panels for breathtaking views enjoy 420
and 360 rad support at the front and top
respectively and breeze through
installation with the dismantle of all
modular design step up your case game
with the a500 aluminum TG and click on
the link below for more info that's
that's all we're doing today we're
installing the water but well we're also
gonna check temperatures of it
afterwards this is a founders edition
block of course so it's gonna slap onto
one of these guys this will be a card
one of two cards it's going into hot
line two alright very very simple
packaging here it did come in a plastic
sleeve that I removed earlier it doesn't
just come bare like this you see it's
got some RGB it's got it back RGB chunk
right on the end
chhoti mother-effer any accessories
thermal pads oh wait there should also
be user's manual this is not a manual no
manual so I've go online for its maybe
they forgot mine it's all good got it
right here on my phone
step one removing factory provided
backplate just set this gap perfect
alright alright super tiny screws try
not to lose any idea I actually don't
feel too bad taking this cooler off
because while it is much quieter than
previous generation founders Edition
cards it is still not the coolest cooler
around especially when you compare it to
some of the high-end Adam born partner
cards so off the goes back with me
Lewis stick it there more pads yeah I
need more tools give it a hex step to
unscrew more screws set that thermal pad
like a villain looks like a booger oh
it's on my phone now gross and finally
the last screw that's fine we gotta take
them off anyway step 3 cleaning the PCB
which I don't have any hold on alright
so we can put the founders Edition
cooler away from now I think this is the
last we'll need to see it for today
wonder where all the unused founders
edition coolers of the world go
forgotten stop coolers where are they
now the full report at eleven
alright clean that chip Step five
cutting the thermal pads why is it low
what is he K doing Intel could be suing
was Lou baby your bat is so hot you
gotta use thermal pads once a month why
is it so cold in your apartment it's a
thermal pad memory is John I'm gonna
straighten this out this looks terrible
part of me it's a little OCD with these
things like I'll cover the memory chips
fully but when they're not perfectly
lined up with each other it just drives
me insane I think I got issues doc I
belong in the thermal padded cell boom
that is more like it Oh get some skipper
I don't know if they give me enough
pants for this crap
I might just have to use those firearms
I'll just have to use some of the
pre-cut pads that were meant for the
memory chips for our BRM and I think we
should have enough covers at that point
the middle P beguiling yep they thought
he could be stopped but they were so
wrong
this is the last pad that's done
step number something installing the
water block a cinder block on the
graphics card yeah let's get some pasty
on here okay freakin dokey several
things - here we go
you just want to put a little pee on
your GPU there it is that's always the
most nerve-wracking part trying to get
all 35 holes aligned on one try and it
looks like we did it I mean I did it you
guys in doing it washers aren't big
enough to go over the screws so maybe
this crew don't need you watch it you'll
get old trains channel channel while a
little bit too much alright
I am prepared to screw for you on camera
getting married again
oh not even fitting it's not the right
screw that's that's why no bad bad screw
babble screw by the way ek hasn't sent
over a back plate yet so that'll have to
wait full-text 180 TI nvidia is a
vampire
said to drain
your wallet nope that needs to be longer
that is what she said to me oh so yeah
it looks still kind of ugly from this
end cuz no backplate but we're ready to
plug her in and give it a whirl
alright so we have the loop setup and
pretty much all the water cooling
Hardware as far as I can tell is from ek
so we've got a pump res combo there's a
sixty millimeter thick rad and in just
the GPU we're not calling anything else
no CPU but we just want to isolate the
video card so we've got Unigine Heaven
4.0 running for about an hour strong now
and our max GPU temp is 52 C that's not
bad
especially when you consider that the
founders Edition card with its stock
cooler runs anywhere from 80 to 84 C
we've cut it down by 30 degrees that's
insane
so the block is doing its job it's also
very quiet of course your mileage may
vary based on your loop configuration
what fans you're using and so forth the
RGB implementation looks fantastic all
the lighting by the fitting area is
super sexy and then even that big slab
of RGB at the end of the card looks
pretty great although you do see some
LED hotspots on the underbelly of that
section so if you were mounting this
block vertically in a case that may
bother some people it may not be a
problem for other people but on the
other side it looks perfectly seamless
and you can't really tell where the LEDs
are apart from that though I'm a big fan
of this block you guys let me know what
you think and the performance is just
mmm yes it makes me even more excited to
get hot line 2.0 underway so stay tuned
for all that guys let me know what you
think in the comments below tousle Luke
on this video if you enjoyed it and get
subscribe for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon till next time
have a good one and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
