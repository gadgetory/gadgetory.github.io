you love with no strings attached to
learn more click on the link below for
morning what's up guys welcome back to
the channel hope you're all doing well
so I'm gonna build another PC today but
it's not actually gonna be a gaming PC
this one is mainly for video playback
purposes a buddy of mine who works in
the office building here has his own
company he's a lawyer he's a cool guy he
actually needs a video playback PC not
for home theater purposes but actually
for his work he specializes in sports
attorney blob business there I'm sure
there's a very proper word or phrase for
that but he used to actually play in the
NFL and I'm not sure if he's comfortable
with me sharing his identity so I'm
gonna keep it anonymous for now but he
used to be an NFL player back in the day
and now he he works in the courtroom on
behalf of professional athletes and he
needs a very simple PC that can play
video back to the jury so that he can
show the effects of long-term
athleticism on professional sports
players so an example that he gave me
was baseball players who after swinging
a bat for 15 years plus some things
start to go loose their joints wear out
there's huge wear and tear on the body
and so he has to be able to show that to
a courtroom in order to make his case
that's a very high level overview of
what he does but basically he needs a
very simple PC so we're gonna help him
out today and build him exactly that so
let's just dive right into the parts
here this is really a great time he
approached me at the perfect time
because the Rison AP use just came out
with the Vega graphics this one in
particular is the Rison 320 200 G for
$99 MSRP you're getting a fantastic four
core four thread Rison chip along with
built in integrated vague graphics and
this is of course the Vega 8 graphics
with eight GPU cores and it is
overclockable I'll probably overclock it
for him the motherboard we're using is
one that you've seen probably featured
on the channel a couple times now it's
the gigabyte a B 350 and gaming Wi-Fi
which obviously means it's oriented
towards a gaming audience but of course
it could be
used for non gaming purposes as well its
mini ITX so you can tell we're going
with a small form-factor build here and
obviously it has Wi-Fi from the name
which is gonna be very useful in the
court room I would imagine and end up to
slot a bunch of other nice features
there so I'll be happy with that
for memories we've got 8 gigabytes of
rip jaws 5 this is of course from
g.skill this is ddr4 memory at 2400
speed we've also got our single drive
for the system which is WD black m dot 2
this is the PCIe nvme drive which is
about 99 bucks for a 256 gig model and
it's really the only drive he's gonna
need because the video files that he's
playing on this thing are gonna be
relatively small and that's mainly what
he's gonna use this system for he may
use it for some productivity slash you
know Microsoft Office applications but
nothing that's gonna really need a bunch
of storage so there should be plenty for
his needs and of course there is always
room for expansion in the
ever-so-popular and one of my favorite
mini ITX cases till this day the fractal
design node - oh - you guys know if
you've been following the channel for a
while that I love this case I've been
using it a long time also fun fact this
is actually my personal case that I've
been using for over a year now but
that's only for the purpose of this
video because I'm still waiting for a
fresh unit to arrive from fractal design
once that gets here I'm actually gonna
gut the system out and put all these
components in the brand the brand new
case cuz I want to I don't want to send
our client home with with a scratched up
slightly modified chassis but I love
this case I think it's gonna look really
nice for him in the courtroom it's got a
very professional look to it it's not
all flashy and you know gamer II and
stuff so I think he'll dig it and I like
the fact that it can be vertical or
horizontal so he has those options there
but those are our parts ladies and
gentlemen you should also bear in mind
that this is an extremely simple bill
we've got one two three four five retail
products I mean and there's technically
eight components in here I should
mention this is the model that includes
the power supply that's the one he's
getting so there's already a power
supply in here 450 watt 80 plus bronze
unit ketchup and mustard cables but
that's okay and there is the included
Wraith stealth inside of the Rison 320
200 G package here so we got CPU cooling
down as well got a nice
overhead camera here getting all fancy
wifey sauces on the B cam or the C can
whatever you want to call it and I have
beer so we are all primed for this here
build let's get started
we got pre-applied thermal paste on our
rate stealth so that'll save us the
whole three seconds thanks Andy
my only one complaint about this
motherboard is that I wish there were
more fan headers there's only two and
you know one of those gets eaten up by
your CPU cooler of course and you would
think it's a it's a fairly feature
forward motherboard that I could see a
lot of people putting inside of like a
much bigger mini ITX case than the note
202 which would probably have more than
one case fan in it not to mention the
potential for radiators
slim pickins and in fan headers
now one thing to point out is that since
we're not dealing with a discrete GPU we
don't have to fiddle around with what's
arguably the worst part about the no 202
by that I mean the PCIe riser card we've
got to PCBs here that snapped together
like so one end goes into the PCIe slot
on your motherboard and the other one
kind of passes through this little
cutout slot of the node - OH - and
there's three standoffs on the wall the
case that you use to mount to the larger
PCB and it could be kind of a pain in
the ass to get in there once it's
installed it all works fine in the end
but I'm really glad we don't have to
deal with this this time around
the other benefit to having such a
simple system like this with only an
MDOT to drive for our storage solution
that we don't have to bother with any
SATA cables of any kind which also at
the same time kind of makes it a shame
that we're dealing with a non modular
power supply because it would definitely
tidy up things and give us a bit more
room in here but at the same time we
don't need this whole area for any
drives we don't have any drives other
than the one that's directly mounted to
the motherboard so we can still stash
all of this excess right Wow bends over
baby
some of you guys may have noticed the
slight modification that I made right
here to the crossbar of our node 202
that was basically so I could pass a
some radiator tubes some liquid cooling
a i/o tubes right through here so yes we
actually did water cooler CPU in this
case at some point which as a reminder
this case does not support a O's
natively so that was super cool and I
felt really badass for doing that of
course some people argued it's
compromised the structural integrity of
the case but I think that's a bunch of
bollocks especially once the lid is on
that provides more than enough support
but like I said we'll be giving our
clients a fresh case so he won't have to
deal with my amateur mods now this is
also where it gets interesting for small
form-factor cases like this because mini
ITX boards tend to have the most
differentiated layouts from board to
board I kind of like the fact that the
USB 3 header for this board is way over
here it works out well for this case
because we get to stretch it across a
little bit more we get to utilize more
of the cable front panel connectors are
also on the polar opposite side here
this can sometimes backfire if the
headers are so far away from where your
front panel connectors stem from that
you can't physically reach but no such
problems here I'm not gonna plug front
panel audio in because it sucks I didn't
just cut that cable off really snip snip
and there's our cable management for the
day nothing spectacular but it'll do
well would you look at that folks
it is oh dude oh that was that was a
really quick I mean I edited this down
obviously but probably 20 minutes to
build the whole thing the fact we didn't
have a discrete GPU or any drives other
than that single MDOT 2 means this was a
really straightforward bill there it is
ladies and gentlemen should we turn it
on should we just make sure it works
all right this sucker is ready for
takeoff Vulcan heavy status so 3 to 8
Hey the other nice thing about this
system is that you have two fans your
CPU cooler and the power supply I know
for a fact both of these are very very
quiet fans so and there's no LEDs really
other than you know the power LED on the
case if it weren't for that man you
would not know this system was idling or
on I should say it is next thing on the
agenda is to load up Windows 10 install
drivers and this thing is good TIG yeah
I really do think that our clients gonna
be happy with how this turns out it's
super quiet it looks nice and it's gonna
perform very well for his needs
yeah no testing necessary I think this
time around probably won't do any brent
benchmarks or anything like that there's
already a ton of benchmarks on these
rise and AP use including my own which I
still need to do a follow up video for
that's a whole other story but that's
all I got for now guys so if you enjoyed
this video if you liked it then show me
I like it but toss and the like on it
you can also check out good ol
floatplane if you want to watch my
videos a whole week early without ads
its fantastico
apart from that guys thank you so much
for tuning in to this one I hope you
guys have a good day and I will see
y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
