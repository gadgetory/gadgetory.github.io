description it should be live now
alright
hello Kyle's YouTube channel hello
everyone
what's going on this is side B of
Awesome Hardware episode 165 I copy your
links and then have your that's fine
it's fine oh I don't know I think it
yeah I'll update him later I get more
money that way
thank you for joining us if you miss
site a go ahead and check it out a lot
of good information there on Paul's half
so you can go to Paul's hardware on
youtube or follow the link in my video
description we talked about the new new
9th gen series processors from Intel and
also sort of the controversy behind that
launch but go there for more details we
also have a nice phone called Steve
gamers Nexus so I think into him for
being on and now we're just doing that
for party traditionally we won't do like
we'll do like half the episode on one of
our channels the other half on another
and we have different segments if you're
new here and then the after party sort
of like a part three that we only stream
to twitch afterwards we kind of just
have fun but which we've only been doing
for like two episodes yeah but but today
I am super hungover still it's like I'm
feeling all right now as about I was
about two hours ago I felt started
feeling much better but it was it was a
rough morning it's your birthday I need
a house birthday everybody I can hang
over a while thank you he's ready
freakin years old I know it's got the
thirty thirty gun and I drink like I
used to anymore very evident day one of
being thirty is just reality slaps you
in the face and last last night in New
York I apparently made and I had a good
reason I had to go back to my room cuz
it my uploaded gone wrong that like
earlier that day so I had to talk to my
wife and have her do an upload from my
computer at home so I didn't go to the
last bar yeah the last bar if I had just
gone with you yeah I wouldn't be in the
position we flew back today and we
haven't neither of us have been home we
came
straight here to the office yeah so
we're just taking it a little bit easier
today than usual but next week we'll
follow a more standard format I'm still
drinking a beer to keep with tradition I
really wish I could join you but I would
probably it would switch from spilling
beer everywhere to just like vomiting on
all the computers yeah we don't want
that I mean maybe you do I don't so um I
guess we could start off by sort of in
honor of the new launch from Intel I did
have a couple XIII 90 boards set my way
from a seat oh my god your birthday
gives Kyle oh wow
dudes guys pouring in you guys oh my
geez my god you really you guys really
don't have to give me birthday money or
anything I just you guys being here is
enough but thank you so much it's always
appreciated and we'll be going over all
the the comments attached to those by
the end of this half so let's let's talk
about these boards though um let's see
they sent me four of them in total three
of them were standard ATX boards and
there was one mini ITX but we're only
gonna unbox two of them because at some
point or another I'll be featuring all
of them on the channel I would guess so
the first one we have thanks again for
ASA two issues for sending these over
the prime Z 398 so I like the prime
Series boards they're not quite as
expensive as the ROG stuff but they were
very reliable I've had really good
experiences with them and this one also
comes with sort of a design change like
similar design but also different as
you're about to see they're probably not
the best way to power this on right here
the motherboard the motherboard yeah
does it power on with just the power
supply we could try that all right cool
what could go oh I'll grab that and you
you talk about this board and show it
off oh this is the Asus prime Z 390
motherboard as you can see it is black
and white there's a plastic shroud here
going down the left half it has this
plastic e parts on it I'm gonna peel
them off can I peel off your plastic
just this once no or actually it's kind
of stuck on I'll leave it what else what
else can we say about this motherboard
there's any long ass and not to slot
down here at the bottom with the cover
on it which looks like a piece of metal
oh yeah all these VRMs up here see if
I'm looking at the information on the
each integrated circuit I can tell you
exactly what they are as well as the
amperage no I can't do that okay believe
it Matt
and from that I mean I'm I've watched
his videos and and learned more from
that it's fascinating but yeah that's
he's very he's very knowledgeable about
this stuff which is really cool um bla
nice I'm about to slot this is a 20 to
10 20 to 110 so even longer than your 22
80s of course it does support 20 to 80
down there as well there's an MDOT 2 up
here which if you talk to JJ he will
tell you that's a good location it's not
the best location but it's a good
location obviously the worser locations
are the ones that are right underneath
the graphics card is it blocked by the
graphics card and also more heat this
will have a little bit more heat because
it's very close proximity to the CPU and
the GPU your best bet is probably going
to be to start off with your your one
down here that also has a cover on it
and then if you need to expand more go
there I think there's a thermal pattern
of that cover as well I should hope so
yeah we do have the USB 3.1 gen2 front
panel connector here I like I like
having those on actually I forgot to say
that when we showed the ROG Dominus
extreme the new LGA 3647 crazy
motherboard that they had at the New
York event that was my critique of it
was it only had one of these come on in
10 of everything else yeah yeah if I had
to point something but yeah I mean looks
looks like as as asus has done for quite
some time with their prime series you
know it's your middle-of-the-road
motherboard it's supposed to have all
the things you need not a whole lot of
extra stuff that you don't need the
bells and whistles that
they used to try to sell you 200 and
$250 motherboards but that you probably
never actually make use of and instead
give you something that's a little
simpler now the things I'm gonna I'm
gonna be critical here because the
things that I that I miss on these
mid-range motherboards and I think
that's I think the way that Asus gets
the competition gets a leg up on Asus
sometimes is they throw a few high-end
higher-end features on boards it's at
roughly the same price point so the
stuff I'm missing on this board that I
would like to see would be surface
mounted power and reset buttons that's
why I brought the screwdriver those are
very convenient to have there's also no
debug led for post or anything it does
have a set of LEDs here on the side for
DRAM VGA boot and CPU so they'll cycle
through those while it's booting up and
that's that's pretty convenient it for
troubleshooting for the first time and
stuff like that my toes flashback button
would have been nice
yeah it's this I really love that he
does this support it still supports it
though right it's just yeah yeah yeah I
mean but the actual physical button is
there button on the board somewhere I
think it still supports it that is
something I would want the USB but I
just make the physical button on the
back is yeah yeah a clear but clear CMOS
that's on IO is also something that's
nice and but yeah again those are those
are all higher-end features I wouldn't
expect all of those to be on this board
but like one or two of them 90% of users
will be perfectly happy and feel Sport
is adequate enough so there you go
all right we got a power supply we're
gonna try to plug her in see if is it
we're not hot what oh wait it didn't
need to hot where ever plugging into a
motherboard yeah teamwork
all in Kyllo plug in each other's hard
work look I feel I feel just the
slightest bit of voltage going through
my fingers under your mother oh yeah
oh I've never done that before nowhere I
mean anywhere anywhere you're holding it
on the back of the motherboard that has
that has contact points if you bridge
them and there's power going through
them you might feel you might feel it
it's a slight tingle it's low-voltage
well I mean that depends on which I
think I'm numb points ear
I can't tell anyway it's probably
actually every guy in the 24 I'm gonna
stop doing this for just asking for at
this point so oh it's already lit up
yeah that even oh yeah I forgot they do
that now yeah this is something that a
lot of motherboards have been doing
which I actually think is a it's a good
feature for someone like a feature
that's probably useless for a vast
majority of people but if you ever want
to do a video just really quick on a
motherboard and show the lights being
able to plug it in and having basic
power connection to that is pretty
pretty nice so you got a light grid here
which looks to be fairly simple there's
like one two three there's like six LEDs
or something right there and then it's
got sort of a faceted plastic piece over
there that it shines through and then
there's a little bit of accent down
there and the chips it's kind of
tessellated and stuff yeah how does a
cool look you can also update the BIOS
without the CPU right is that you should
I mean a USB bass flash bank is what I
would need to support that's what he
just calls it right right and I can't
confirm that this motherboard supports
it because I don't know for sure but I
would expect it to so yeah I think
that's probably about all there is to
say for yeah quick review we've got
we've got one other board here to look
at right now here's the ROG Maximus 11
formula this this is if you're if you're
extreme know the extreme is to know this
is if you're if you're super formula
it's like a whole like to race the newer
cars or something or make you know this
is a
quite a bit more expensive but also
loaded with a lot of the same features
polishes talking about missing on the
crime board and this is wow this is
really heavy which is usually a good
sign of quality means it's just all
copper every so this or Neela Wow has an
ek water cooling solution for the power
delivery right up there at the top and
that's probably copper yeah and this is
this is one of the things that the
format like sexy don't before the fort
so like the formula is usually really
good overclocking board and it usually
has some form of water cooling support
of course it's also RG I'm silent it's
very quiet usually that's a good thing
with PC parts but not plastic feeling I
don't know can you guys even hear that I
can barely hear happily a little bit oh
these aren't as satisfying as I thought
is this one of you this board sucks
I mean it's pretty good Mike you
probably picked up a little bit probably
yeah
at any rate it looks like they've kind
of like rampage six extreme a little bit
just sort of the little cover plate here
on the lower half of the board yeah I'm
sure it gets illuminated as we'll check
out in just a moment let's see there's
probably I wanna say this is this is a
really wide panel it almost bands the
entire width of the board I wonder if
there's actually two MDOT two slots
under this piece because it looks really
long just for it is for one it's very
long just by any one really long end up
- no yeah I do have a screwdriver just
small any that guy I'm gonna peel this
plastic off because this looks like a
really good one
I heard that one was good all right I
like the board again
this thing is a fingerprint magnet
though there's like mirrors on it that's
it
Oh your laptops angry I know just it
gets excited no reason all right take
this guy off here okay we are checking
the m-dot to support which you probably
could have looked in the manual for but
does not anything about it but yeah this
is more hands-on
maybe that guy - they're on both sides I
don't know this looks like you might pop
it up from just that end but oh maybe
you lift it from here oh no it's all one
piece this is a very wide slot cover it
looks like underneath you'll find two
slots well that's it that's new there's
actually two slots under there like
facing each other symmetrically - I've
got two slots the antiphon kind of a
double dragon and then come and that is
a good spot for it as long as you're not
doing a - a GPU configuration right and
if you are then you're blocking a lot of
stuff anyway with your second graphics
card but cool all right this is this is
metal yeah it has some aluminum some
texture there for some additional
surface area iminium let's see we do get
the debug LED there's quite a few
addressable RGB headers here get one two
three of them one of which is a three
pin the other two or four pin plenty of
fan connectors and binti ooh good and
plenty oh very oh no shortage of you at
83 fixed i/o shield fixed oh oh yeah
fixed yes I was like it was broken
before they repaired it yeah we do get
the BIOS flash back button physical
button and clear CMOS you could also you
know stick a USB you must be in there
the BIOS USB port here is like BIOS
shortcuts that you can set up and if you
want to use them they're like keyboard
shortcuts you can I can't get very
specific that that's the port you need
to plug your keyboard into in order to
access those bio shortcuts right I
wonder is it do you think that's tend to
give it
the red one or do you think that's just
like ones Intel and ones third-party
that one says 5g the one on the left
Oh left and then another thing five
gigabit I thought I would trim from one
to ten
yeah there's a quanti uh okay a QC - 1 1
1 c5 gig land huh didn't alright sure
I mean I'll take it I've Gigabit LAN
which but I don't know I don't think
there's any five gigabit like switches
or anything right so you have to use 10g
and it's tough which okay I mean let's
plug it in so just found a pair of reset
buttons debug LED front front USB 3.1
gen2 alright there's Wi-Fi - good ports
memory up to 40 400 megahertz when you
overclock yeah we don't need the EPS all
we need is the main supports says sports
to weight or quad GPU SOI that's kind of
funny look at that display right there
that's a no LED display
oh that's cool it says formula I thought
it looked a little weird just having a
mirror in the middle of the board but
that is really nice it's it's got
graphics already got a graphic wow it's
pretty wonder if that tanks your
performance I'm just kidding oh I wonder
if that and that's probably customizable
you can probably create your own I would
imagine yeah they've done that sort of
thing in the past
yeah the msi god-like actually also has
a similar display to that that's up here
and i believe it's also LED so i guess
maybe this is the new trend yeah like
you've already got your RGB handle then
you need a no LEDs display on your
actual motherboard that's also RGB lamps
you can kind of see the lighting here
there's accents along here and they're
doing that thing where it's like the
LEDs are on the side and then they kind
of shine
through this grid which is actually a
pretty cool effect it's very very dreamy
along here and up there like a slash I
should mention I should have also
mentioned that this is this isn't
sponsored by Asus or anything they just
sent these boards over and we figured
you guys might want to check them out
quick little first look yeah so cool
nice all right let's see oh we have one
more thing to unbox it's actually we do
if you guys read the full title of this
video yeah you know get whyphy sauce she
can she can bring out the blast unboxing
item I'm gonna I'm gonna do you sponsor
ad oh yeah okay hey guys did you know
that today's episode of awesome hardware
is sponsored by Toshiba indeed there it
is wait hold on where's the other to
achieve of products I need any of this
that's right Toshiba maker a fine
product such as SSDs yes we have three
SSDs that we are sharing information
with y'all about there's a 2.5 inch SSD
the TR 200 there is a little tiny m2 SSD
so cute which is which is called the RC
100 and then this is the XS 700 which is
an external USB see Jen USB 3.1 gen2
type-c connector on it for external
storage these are all based on BICS
flash memory which is nice fast memory
that's also not terribly expensive so
you'll find good prices on these SSDs
very they're like the TR 200 is almost
always towards the top of the list when
I look up SDS and sort by price per
gigabyte oh yeah so it's pretty pretty
solid choice there yep
Kyle is currently unboxing yeah I mean
XS 700 I'm ruining these blah blah even
more I've here on the show for you guys
because I kind of just I just want to
hold it and see it so you know how small
it is or whatever in size wise it's a
it's a pretty standard 2.5 inch drive
external yeah yeah just to get a feel
for the quality and stuff
oh that's actually a lot sleeker than I
thought it would be that's a nice little
track and it's got sort of a rubber
texture on the back so that it doesn't
fall out of your hand easily comes with
an adapter for Type C to type a so if
you need that and you lose your plug
it's also got a type C to type a cable
first and lovely that's about it I like
it alright so thank you again to Toshiba
available in a variety of capacities and
there's links in the video's description
if you guys want to check them out Shiva
and so on the following up event we do
have that one unboxing that I was
hinting at earlier very exciting diff
why Vsauce would like to come in clear
the center ok can we power it with the
power supply
facing all right your birthday birthday
cake Brennan okay everyone know one two
three happy birthday to you happy
birthday
Wow this is from LG LG sent over they
ought to send over birthday cakes to
their their favoritest creators and
that's that's apparently what I look
like to them your head fell off my head
oh it fell off shipping okay I was like
am I supposed oh yeah because it looks
like why am i leaning back I try to put
your head back oh I'm like my frosting
hair got all over the entertainment
center there we go that looks a little
bit more probably my postures not that
bad guys oh no it's creepily turning its
head cuz Wow
oh it's like The Exorcist that it is
something else yeah we actually did a
pretty good job attention to details on
point and we even have this little
headphone stand and stuff no um it's
impressive it's amazing now I feel like
I gotta like take a patch of my hair and
stick it on to the entertainment center
to make it yeah match the cake code
lineup and it'll be one once fully I
guess we could I mean we have to take a
piece right at least a smaller thank you
LG this is awesome yeah and I can eat
the TV can you no no I cannot you can
that is does cardboard the front of it
there's frosting on on the front a
little bit around the board of the bezel
the bezel is frosting the rest of it is
cardboard and now my teeth hurt that's
good bezel now I'm never afraid to eat
the cake just focus yeah I got a lot of
parts here possibly inedible huh all
right I'm gonna eat my head at some
point all right so will we okay for the
paraphernalia for sure
kinky let's start going over some
donation comments let's do that
first we have some donations that are
made on my half yes starting with
Huizinga X's vising X $5 only
considering quality not price ek orb its
power for quality
ooh if you're trying though bidding
honestly
those are probably two of the highest
quality water cooling companies yeah
that I've worked with yep its power is
very very well known for their actual
fittings yes so they might have David
they might have an edge up on ek when it
comes to the fittings sure I haven't
really used bits of power like blocks
through I've only really used DK to be
honest yeah so I can't I can't speak to
that but they're both really nice so
maybe mix and match you can do that
can't go wrong either way it smells
great
great Wow Wow I'm so glad you failed at
that smells like great Aaron Chet's
warning me to they're like no oh wow
dude well I guess my hand didn't go
unscathed at least you got my hand you
did I guess I got it first
hold this play I'm afraid to do anything
for you right now and that is a huge
piece just massive that's that's big
enough really you want to go what's your
birthday yeah you got any ridiculous
amounts of birthday cake nope just don't
get any on the laptops yay yeah thanks
I'm I mean I hate you but we only had
one fork so you go spoon all right
that's right
spoons spoons in effective you have
napkins well I mean I'll get more just
just a little cake thanks LG for the
cake whoo you guys Rock uh I'm gonna go
home tonight and watch netflix on my
awesome lg tv
next up MB 67 yes 1337 hey the elite
donation says happy birthday huh oh
thanks man
thank you very much thank you the wishes
than ticular for that one bazinga X with
more with another $5 donation says did
you hear Microsoft finally developed a
product that does not suck they call it
a vacuum what wait did they act do they
actually make a vacuum I'm gonna get the
idea I appreciate the pun they but now
I'm actually curious about a Microsoft
people in chat want you to eat your head
oh yeah
yeah I'll do it for you guys give me a
sec though also your head is turned like
slowly I know that's what I was saying
to look at you like that's I'm not
looking at myself oh my god
and and like there's I have no neck my
neck is a toothpick which okay thank you
take any pictures of this before it was
disassembled I guess I care no this is
the money shot
that is like I'm honored here looks so
good like I know you can see what it was
all like they must have a really good
really good cake person yeah no I don't
know where they order these from they've
sent similar cakes like Linus and yeah
Ede I think and right for the people
maybe Jane
anyway cool go for the head thank you
for saying that I don't exactly know
what you're referring to but maybe they
didn't make it vacuum Dez Jones $5
donation happy birthday Kyle you're now
three years younger than me oh wow let's
see if you can keep that up yeah
catching up any day now pass him all
right sorry sorry Kate Kyle your heads
up here goes no longer oh it's so whoa
this feels so wrong eating my own face
all right here we go that's it
what's it made of inside is that like is
it all icing is there like that bite was
probably is that like dough or some
thousand calories really it's like super
dense it's almost like doughy well it's
a little doughy it's incredibly sweet
that's probably as much of my head I'll
I'll eat for now yeah you got a save
state a good look for me
save some head for later cam I think I
think this also means that I'm getting a
bald spot right about here as I'm
turning 30 yep all right back in you go
don't look anymore Jackson Oswald $5
donation new shirt idea mm-hmm too many
good times lead to a bad time and it's
all in raga
raghu-bhai RGB well yeah we need some
preliminary pulmonary designs for that
one yep Jordans so Sorbo I believe
that's correct
50 no region Crona says happy birthday
Kyle quick question getting a new
monitor standing between the Acer X B 3
2 1 HK and the BenQ PD 3200 you which
would you recommend hmm first stop
thanks for the birthday wishes and the
the oh I thought it was dollars but no
reason crying still that's a lot thank
you
I think I think that's like the XP 33 to
1 HK I've seen they're viewed
extensively 2 inch IPS g-sync
that's 4k a really really good monitor
it's gotten rave reviews all around Ben
q I'm not too familiar with this model I
don't recognize it off the top of my
head but Ben Q is also known for making
great progress we're actually using that
we've been using a pen q 4k monitor for
the live stream for the last year too if
any that's what this motors 32 inch 4k
designer monitor is that what this
monitor is oh is it no oh no no it's not
that's more of a game and as gaming one
stands is a little different yeah that's
a good stand though yeah dude those are
those are both good what's the pricing
difference the Acer is a lot more at
school
to a thousand at least on Amazon right
now the BenQ is 700 but I don't think it
has g-sync
yeah this might be a free single panel
so that's that's just a premium that you
pay for g-sync
so I guess it really just boils down to
what graphics card you have at that
point if if you're not too concerned
about the price between these two and
you are planning and doing a lot of
gaming I would recommend the Acer for
the free sync if gaming isn't mean thank
you for the free sink I'm sorry Acer for
the Jesus juice if you have an Nvidia
graphics card right if you're not
concerned about the g-sync that
absolutely go with the BenQ because say
for a lot less money mm-hmm and the
specs are very similar between them to
otherwise self processing our very own
friend and moderator and chat thank you
for the $10 donation you have to do that
gig so we should be paying you know
happy birthday did you get to draw a
higher line on the wall this year yes
love you man love you too dude you got
Yeller whatsapp whoa taller now
no I think I think he's oh yeah yeah oh
I thought it I read parallel yes he's
making a short joke which is why I love
sell at first I thought he was saying
like are you getting more power from the
wall this year in reference to my
overclocking fail video where I didn't
have a high enough wattage power supply
and kept shutting down but I totally
misread that and now I just realized
you're insulting me so thanks oh thanks
oh I love you leave a job BB ciao when
is Lyles birthday oh yeah it's good
question I kind of forget will he be on
the show after for a couple more couple
of minutes well Paul ever finish his
HTPC find out next time on Dragon Ball Z
and that rhymed well done did these are
all questions that I do not have the
answers to you right now not sure when
Lyles birthday is don't he we haven't
had anyone else on the show so I don't
see Lyle jumping in I've never seen Lyle
and Kyle on the same place but I've
never actually met Lyle and cursings
because I can't stand Lyle I take him in
small dose huh I will finish my HTPC I
was I was doing a little bit of work on
it last week and then all this
oh really see if you launch stuff happen
wow that's a problem that seems progress
yeah I mean I'm trying to figure out
what what next steps are and I think I
need to go back to the place where I got
the wood originally actually but yeah I
wanted I'm I will I will do that
ah next time I Drive elves all right
Thank You TV
thank you Sam settle off settle for 99
happy birthday Cal thanks to you both
have a great content thanks Sam thank
you Sam appreciate it
guys have you Hardware BBQ I like that
name nice a hundred rupees I think I run
a PC hardware review website in India
did you check the AMD system specs on
principal technologies report it's
paired with a Z 370 and Z 390
motherboard page 14 what I thought was
as X 470 yeah are you sure you're eating
that right I mean obviously that's a
typo if that if that is the case um 100
and Indian rupees is a dollar 3500 they
get the Furies I'll take anything I can
get
yeah let's look into that uh Jim frozen

know mari Rubin M $5 no comment
thank you thanks ribbon thank you very
much much appreciated Phoenix 1861 $4.99
the benchmarking issue has convinced me
to wait on my new build for the zem to
Verizon 3000 series great job
PT and Intel hmm I believe he's speaking
sarcastically with that last bit and yes
that does look like sarcasm somewhat
agree where this is the scuttlebutt on
the AMD stuff coming up soon is I did we
we've been told that Lisa sue is doing
the keynote at CES and that might mean
that they have something to talk about
mm-hmm so there's end to stuff we might
see more of it see yes I'm open for that
Libby that would be cool seemed like
that'd be good timing for it new
motherboards do that's all for the
donations from my half of the show so
thanks to all you guys who were sending
that over for me
meanwhile on Kyle's half you're starting
off with the $10 donation from cells so

rule of no more no more face pies from

happy birthday Kyle and Lyle it's not
Lyles birthday we're not the same person
why is everyone think that let's hear
about you guys getting to hang with
Gordon from PC world oh yeah I remember
reading his articles in maximum PC you
used to be a huge fan of his work at
maximum PCB yeah like honestly I I meet
Gordon at events now and he's like hey
Paul and I'm like hey Gordon and I and I
still get this sort of like like oh my
gosh is Gordon happy in fact I used like
maximum PC was was my bread and butter
back in the day maximum pc used to be
boot back in the 90s mmm and then they
changed Maximum PC and I just I always
liked their reporting style I liked that
it was maximum pc minimum bs was the
solution was the sublight line there and
and just Gordon has a very direct style
of writing and addressing things and
he's very honest and forthright so yeah
yeah I like I said I still every time I
see him and get to hang out and stuff
and we've been doing some like
interviews and stuff because PC world
has been actually doing a great job in
the video space if you guys are looking
for other YouTube channels on technology
I highly recommend the PC worlds
yeah to channel and check out the
interview that he did with us that he
brought us on for yeah at the event we
discussed the the launch and the
controversy as well that we talked about
in the first half of the show and we
were also having a few drinks by then so
it's a really fun / funny interview and
informative yeah check it out on their
other age Britain's great yeah like all
his stuff what's next grabbin gremlin
gremlin yeah 10 bucks
granion happy birthday happy birthday
Kyle thank you also had a quick question
if I'm looking at a smaller form factor
for my first build would you go mini oh
Jesus Mini ITX or micro ATX hmm if
you're do you ever want to stream like
I'm assuming you're gonna game
people who are building pcs are doing
gaming PC's do you ever want to do live
streaming that's not to say you can't
live stream on a mini ITX system but
you're gonna be stuck with external USB
based capture cards because you're not
going to have PCI Express slot to do
that on that or I mean there's other
scenarios where you might want more PCI
Express slots to add on to do an add-on
card but that's the main limitation is
expansion so I like I really like micro
ATX as a form factor and feel like the
main drawback there is it's just not
quite as popular so there's not as much
variety when it comes to motherboard and
case choices sure but but they're out
there yeah I mean it's it's really about
like what you plan on doing with this PC
in the next two years if all you're
really thinking about doing is gaming or
if you know that like a Razer ripsaw or
something like that will be sufficient
for you as an external capture card then
you probably be fine with mini ITX and
and it is cool to get like a super small
system together
yeah and stuff that's what I would say
it's like mini ITX go for that if like
you absolutely love the form factor just
so much or there's a really awesome like
little case that you've been dying to
use and you value that more than
potential expandability down the line
yeah because it is limited in that sense
so good luck though with whatever you
choose Phoenix
1861 once again $99.99 holy moly
we need thank you we need to do the last
three on my birthday I know I should
have a birthday every day Kyle have the
happiest of days thanks man
use this to help take wifey sauce out to
dinner now that I've said it out loud
she will definitely hold me to that
happy wife happy life my friend
I'm very true on a channel relevant
topic will either of you two be
reviewing the fantex evolve x case at
all keep putting out the great content
actually I'm planning to use the evolve
X for a very special project that oh
yeah I think I already announced this
I'm using it for hotline - I've decided
I don't know if I'm gonna go dual system
yet with it
because that is an option that's kind of
appealing to me right now but we'll see
I'm very excited to actually test it out
because it was one of my favorite cases
if not my favorite case at Computex
slash or this year so yeah it seemed
like for the initial launch today
only did a little bit of media seating
for that yeah I haven't come up with the
project that I would want to use it for
like a just from what I have kind of in
my pipeline right now mm-hmm but I was
it was one of the cases I was most
impressed with so I imagine if something
comes up like that and I'll probably
take a look at Kyle's work on outline
too and see how that goes and stuff so
yeah yeah thank you very much again
Phoenix
yeah BB Chau once again $5 thanks man
wouldn't it be cool if you went home
after this and Lyle had a surprise
gathering of people for you at home oh
god baby oil baby oil and all happy
birthday beer no beer beer for the next
24 hours at least for me but no that
would be horrifying because if you think
miles bet you should meet his friends
they're not like bad people they're just
just different than us in a bad way
physically physically emotionally
yeah but thank you very much TV Huizinga
x $100 dude 100 more dollars man say
yeah great holy moly
wow you jeez okay I don't even know what
to say now uh Oh what the heck happy
birthday I cannot remember thirty that
was 28 years ago for me have a great day
hmm nice then you were very wise you're
very much respect I have much respect
for my elders not calling you old or
anything but just you know people who
have lived through more and had more
experiences in life than I have was the
Neil deGrasse Tyson thing you were
saying earlier the Neil deGrasse Tyson
thing oh yeah it was a the trending
hashtag that day was I knew I knew I was
old when and I think his was I knew I
was old when I read the day I realized
that I didn't know shit when I was 30
and I read that and I was like I'm
turning 30 in like two days like and I
was like more - tell us what you know
Neil so basically now you know that if
it's like I'm the information that
really matters is the stuff you will
learn from now on yeah that's that's the
lesson early true
I got a start but now I can start paying
attention to
everything around me it's good makes
sense thanks again bazinga
boy boy jj5 cool 1g5 cool one $4.99
about to watch aliens the 1986 version

next week thank you guys for all your
great work
sounds like a fun night out with the
kids how younger your kids I was gonna
say like aliens is like one of the more
terrifying than disease of its day it's
still pretty holds up well yeah
hopefully they did a lot of practical
effects in there so yeah that's a I mean
it's a really good it's a good movie
it's great yeah um yeah and enjoy yeah
if you if later tonight you definitely
get you know get up cuz your kids are
like wake up screaming because they're
having nightmares about aliens just just
record the look on the cashiers face

galovski well $10 happy birthday thanks
man hey thanks Chris thank you I said
thank you even though my birthday Dave
Merc five dollars no comment mr. mark
thank you thank you Dave I like money
your oh tuned 69 woohoo five dollars
happy birthday I enjoy all the content
that's good too soon you haven't seen my
next video never done anything
Jim frozen once again ten dollars thanks
Jim super cool always cool that mr.
frozen if people say Jim is a cold guy
but really he's just an he's he's just
cool like he's warm-hearted to the
center probably like five years yeah the
perfect wine center negative ten dollars
happy birthday kids aisle hookahs aisle
is he clearly has the same birthday as I
do and so I I like him already I think
you negative I appreciate your
positivity just about your name Wyatt
Pete 499 hey guys I've been out of the
loop lately because I got married Wow
congratulations shout out to my wife
Gabby for putting up with me and my new
custom water build hbd
happy birthday thanks and that's great
shout out to Gabby Wyatt's wife hi Gabby
I don't know if she's watching but
having built many custom article loops
that my wife has been pretty tolerant of
thank you for being intolerant to that
because right and it's a it's a chaotic
experience yes deep very messy Magnavox
$10 you read some company happy birthday
I love awesome hardware being watch been
watching forever Thank You Magnavox
thank you that's you remind me your name
reminds me of like those little cassette
tapes oh yeah
Marty Mooney with the five dollar
donation here is some Monday's I like
your stuff I finally have money I can
donate oh my Thank You Marty Thanks you
should also save some money and and like
you know make sure you have a nice
computer because that's also a good
thing for money but we appreciate the
five dollars for sure definitely jmr
1969 ex with the $10 donation have a
2600 K 16 gig rig 16 gigs of ram I guess
trying to hold out for 10 nanometre but
the i-9 looks sweet any thoughts I am
mental before waiting how big will the
difference really be um like the
difference will probably be like 10 it's
in percentage on average from a 2600 K
Oh from from 87 RQ from last gen yeah
that's a it's it's you'd be looking at a
pretty decent step up I begin abuse what
graphics card you're using and then I'd
also be curious what you're using it for
the i-9 is nice but you're also looking
at eight cores which you might not
necessarily need for all of your games
and they got six core options and
everything like that five hundred and
twenty dollars CPU yes so it was playing
desktop territory is pretty expensive so
like I would keep an eye on like the
8700 K or like the 9600 K and 9700 K
yeah might also be choices but of course
you should wait until we have more
reviews on those to actually get a
closer look at the performance tool real
reviews but you're talking about ten
nanometer and I feel like that is really
like the next big jump that Intel's
gonna make and they've really been just
hanging on to 40 nanometers for so long
yeah so and
and and it does seem like that's
probably coming next year so it's hard
to say for you right now but I would say
if you've been holding out forever if
you got the money right now go ahead and
buy right now
because if you are looking at next year
you might also be looking at 25 percent
more if you're in the u.s. yeah
for almost all the products and that
would really suck so you might get a
little bit more for your money right now
versus then yeah okay Marty Mooney $5 oh
yeah I forgot
happy birthday Kyle more monies thanks
Marty Thank You Marty and your last
name's Mooney which sounds like money
just thought I'd point that out that's
true
man II also kind of sounds like money
man II MediaTek all these all these
names are so money ten dollars
happy birthday Kyle sad we couldn't meet
up here in New York City I tweeted out
at Paul yesterday I hope you guys had a
good time here in New York City except
before the weather enjoy and get some
rest I actually like the weather yeah I
was like kind of cold yeah yeah it's
been too hot all summer here Thank You
Manny I'm sorry I did get a few tweets
that came through from people who
realized we were in New York and we're
asking us to do a fan meetup the these
past couple trips we've done to New York
or that I've done a couple recently
they're very short we were only there
for like two nights you kind of fly in
one night and then have a thing the next
day and then fly out the morning after
that and they're also NBA events so we
can't really talk about them before we
go yeah so if we're gonna do a fan
meetup like I feel like we should have
some sort of like for worrying for it so
people if people do want to come they
can write and if it's just like hey guys
we're gonna be here in like 30 minutes
like you might do that and then like no
one can make it because nobody knows
that it's actually happening so yeah I'm
sorry we weren't able to do that but um
it's tricky at events where we do have a
bit more free time we will try to tweet
out early and see if we can do more of
that yeah cuz then person meetups are
cool they were there thank you very much
many Jeff Christiansen $10 donation what
it was you're young eat the head dude
that head is it's just too too rich and
too thick and the textures it's almost
like the texture of chewing gum
but you know it dissolves eventually if
you keep shooting it long enough this is
that like isn't there some material that
like cake artists use that they can like
roll up and sculpt to commemorate a
bunch of different stuff I think right I
think that's what this is it's like a
sculpting type type very even really
suitable or even supposed to eat it I
don't know I'm kind of worried cuz my
stomach's been so marzipan marzipan is
that right Guido Sarducci said it's
marzipan fun fondant fondant fondant
fondant it everyone sends fun fun day
come on find it always on point a
fondant okay well I guess I just had my
first taste of fondant and you're not
too fond of it are you okay Santiago
Perez 25 bucks happy birthday Kyle whoo
thanks man thanks Santiago
I like $25 Jenner's Dave mark five
dollar donation happy birthday what
cooler would you recommend for twenty
nine fifty X I've read reviews on the
inner max TR for failing and what memory
should I use I want the four by sixteen
gig I also read some reviews of the TR
for failing which was a little
disappointing there is a TR for version
two though where they have addressed the
issues and I have not heard negative
things about that one so they did make
an update to it I would say if your
water cooling the 2950 X definitely it's
worth your while to get one of the one
of the unit's that has blocks is
specifically made for it because they
just have wider fin or radius on the
bottom yeah and they're better at that
the like ASA tech based coolers that you
get the bracket for their functional
that work but you're gonna get better
performance out of one that's made for
it so alright yeah and I Rex is the one
that stands out to me that really made
that I have two of the tr4 twos and both
units are performing great okay so
highly suggested alright memory he
should use the running four by sixteen
gig just get something like that's
backed by a good trustable truck trusted
brand you know see if you can get single
ranked dims see if you can get Samsung B
dies the the dims that use that tend to
be a little bit more expensive lease no
flare X is like the guaranteed way to
get that but those tend to be like a
good 50 bucks more than comparable kits
yeah
if you decide on your motherboard you
can use the motherboard qualified vendor
list who finds kits that have been
specifically tested in it you know you
can plug in set the XMP or do CP values
or whatever and they'll just work so
that would be my recommendation base it
on your motherboard yeah they're lower
latency - yeah castle agencies so he's
good and go first like 3200 speed or
better yes Ralph Allen's whele $5
donation happy birthday Kyle have a good
day I love you thank you I love you too
and this I love anyone could give such a
warm warm message very easily bought
Matt s10 door donation with no comments
so thank you Matt for your donations
appreciate it much obliged
luis fonseca $5 donation will well an
i-9 9900 k be good for a guy who is
starting a twitch channel will be gaming
and broadcasting on the same pc yes it
would be good but not in a splatter
there are other options out there yeah
six corn ain't Corizon processors do a
really good job of this but basically we
gonna want six cores if not eight or
more or if not eight so yeah I am
expecting the 9900 kk to be much better
at gaming and streaming then a little
especially like a 7700 k like one of the
quad cores but again it's just gonna be
a matter of like what options are out
there what graphics Carter your
parenting it with a resolution are you
playing at if you're playing at a higher
resolution like 1440 or 4k and then the
CPU actually becomes less important so
you got I can I could definitely see it
you know as a nutri newer chip and
Intel's obviously been testing it
against it's like the Rison flagship the
2700 X so I wouldn't be surprised at all
if it you know the 900k outperforms 2700
X I think that boils down to is it gonna
be $200 better than that chip because
there's a sizable price gap there yeah
and then I think that Verizon 7 1700 was
on sale for less than 200 bucks recently
and that's an eight-core so yeah there's
some there's some very compelling
choices on the rise inside that you kind
of have to look at and balance and look
at your budget and everything like that
that said if like your if if your stance
is like that's not a concern for me 300
bucks versus 500 bucks then you're
probably gonna want to go with the 9900
okay once you've waited for independent
views a bit of course right all right
Dave mark five dollars more money for
your birthday
hey thanks Dave can't complain about
that I like it
we're almost at the end of this guy so
if you are considering a donation don't
because we're gonna cut this up yes
Robin Robin corner $10 hey Kyle thanks
for supporting the little guys happy
birthday buddy and of course there's
even this little guy yeah didn't really
support his head but you
well I supported according to Matt got a
while Thank You Robin shotgun 3301 20
bucks uh happy birthday Kyle Paul I love
you too thank you thank you shotgun ah
you guys have inspired me to build my
first PC and 2700 Z MSI gaming Pro
carpet I think he maybe he means it's
2700 X MSI gaming Pro carbon of course
RH 100 Ivy to 32 gigs of 3,200 speed
ddr4 ram 256 gig m dot 2 by WD and an
msi 1080i duke with the 1000 watt power
supply that's a dream piece here that's
a very nice configuration yeah you have
a lot of extra watts on your power
supply like of like if you were pitching
this to me as a parts list that's the
only thing I would say as you probably
don't need that many watts but right um
there's nothing wrong with that you're
probably sitting at a better efficiency
point with the power that you are using
there but uh anyway thank you shotgun
for your donation very much Jim congrats
on the on the building
Jeff Christiansen $10 says happy
birthday love both your content and got
the girlfriend addicted as that is our
regular Tuesday night event now wow

secondhand but I'm having temperature
issues wanting to water cool but can't
find a GPU block any recommendations
I'm GPU blog I would think 1080i gaming
OC that's a that's a asus strix there
are problems also guards that are gaming
OC it's it's hard to say you need you
need to find out if your graphics card
has the reference design PCB or if it's
a custom design one if it's the
reference design you'll have more
choices for blocks if it's a custom one
you'll have to find a block that's
specifically made for your model of
graphics card right which is pretty
common for a lot of a lot of the custom
cards too and that said we've had good
experiences with EK bits power oh I
can't speak to their blocks but I've
heard other people speak to their blocks
oh I think I mean fantex actually makes
some really good positive and texas
blocks yeah
I had a pretty good experience with my
alpha cool stuff mm-hmm I like that and
they actually just just came out with
new blocks they're older ones are a
little bit more industrial looking and
they're not really see-through they have
ones that are a little kind of more
Akins like the EK style where they got
the acrylic so you can kind of see
through it and they're right there RGB
as well I don't know if they have the
RGB built into them or not I feel like
those blocks the ones that you have in
Riptide those would look really good
transparent with some lighting animism
ow yeah well there's like really
blocking there's like they're large but
those right to the bottom they're
actually big heat sinks girlf in so yeah
you'd lose some of that but I'm critical
Manning yeah Peter hopefully some of
