brought to you by fantex berta gear
enter max be quiet and cable mob you can
learn more about their products and the
links below what's going on guys welcome
back to my coverage of Computex 2018 I'm
here at the fantex booth
however they kind of dropped a huge bomb
on me when I got here that I was not
expecting they're actually launching
their sub brand known as metallic gear
or mg to the public starting today which
is super exciting this is the same
fantex quality we've come to know and
love super high-end premium materials
being used
however for catering to a whole new
audience a sort of a mainstream audience
that maybe can't afford some of the
high-end premium cases that fantex
offers but still wants a very
streamlined build overall with a lot of
the essential features that most
enthusiasts are looking for so let's
quickly go down the line and take a look
at their neo line neo is sort of their
the line of this new sub brand that
we're gonna be exploring today and
there's a variety of cases there's
actually four new cases that we're gonna
be checking out today including the Neo
this is an ATX case you can see it's
very minimalistic it's got some
ventilation on the sides here the front
panel pops out like so completely
tooless you can see we've got two
included 120 s at the front there there
is a an LED RGB LED at the bottom here
which is expandable so you can connect
that up to your to your motherboard and
so forth
very nice accessibility here for your
hard drives that we don't have to remove
either of the tempered glass side panels
that's right you get two tempered glass
side panels on this case which is
fantastic I believe this case is gonna
retail for around $99 power and we set
up here looks like you've got an RGB
button on the side with two USB 3 there
is also audio jacks and it's kinda hard
to take a look inside here do you mind
if I remove the panel really quick now
it's it's pretty clean cable routing
actually there no grommets or anything
like that but they tuck away just behind
this little popped out piece of the
motherboard tray
there's also cutout to the bottom
there's sort of a semi power supply
shroud going on here you definitely get
like a top panel but you still get
visible power supply and things like
that you can stash more cables under
here if you
wish seven expansion slots you get three
included like I said those 120 s at the
front and one more at the back and I
also want to point out that you can do
up to a 280 millimeter radiator at the
front of this case also take a look at
that that pattern at the bottom of the
panel this is sort of a design that is
sort of sort of repeating throughout
these neo cases here is the sort of a
sort of polygonal tessellated feel which
I actually like it also kind of serves a
purpose of covering up the power supply
and the hard drive cage taking a look at
this side of the motherboard tray we've
got a couple things going on here
three SSD mounts actually includes two
trays and you can mount these kind of
wherever you want and have room for
cable management elsewhere or you don't
have to route any cables in this area
you can mount them all behind or route
them all behind this cable cover that
has a looks to be a single thumb screw
there very easy it's on a hinge so you
can easily just kind of pop it on and
off as you see fit and then continuing
with that a nice polygonal design here
at the bottom of the tempered glass so
all together looks very nice very clean
looking and this case will be offered
very much like the micro ATX and one of
the mini ITX cases we're about to look
at and will be offered in both black and
silver so you get your pick of the
leather there here we have the Neo micro
which is a micro ATX version of the Neo
a lot of similar features you get the
SSD mounts now on the top of the power
supply shroud which is kind of cool if
you want to show those off from this
side of the chassis you also get the
same sort of tempered glass on both
sides you're not really sacrificing much
here in terms of functionality but you
are getting a much smaller footprint in
size if you're looking for a more
compact system you get one two three
four expansion slots and it does look
like you have some some room for routing
cables back here with some velcro straps
to tie everything down moving on to the
Neo Mini this is perhaps one of my
favorites the mini ITX version of course
you guys know I love small form-factor
builds this is actually really cool the
first thing that you see here is is the
the tessellated pattern here is actually
now moved to the top but it's serving
the purpose of covering up your power
supply which is mounted at the top of
the case there's also plenty of room for
water cooling here you can do a two
hundred and eighty millimeter radiator
at the front or two forty on the side
where they have those RGB fan
those fans are purchased separately
there's also plenty of ventilation at
the bottom of the case which is actually
really good considering the GPU gets
mounted close to the bottom of the
chassis still get 2 USB 3 mic and
headphone and LED what's hooked up to
that and last but not least we have the
Neogene mini which sort of is a premium
version of the neo mini we just took a
look at the two main changes or upgrades
I should say of this chassis are the
tempered glass front panel with the nice
design and then also you get the
included vertical bracket or I shouldn't
say it's a bracket it's actually built
in never mind it's a completely built in
solution for vertical GPU mounting which
is kind of makes this a showpiece case
if you really want to just show off
every piece of the project you also get
the riser cable included so again a very
nice very nice alternative to a you know
a conventional mini ITX case so there it
is guys that is m-g or metallic gear
from fantex this is a brand-new line sub
line I'm digging it so far I can't wait
to get my hands on one of these cases
and take it for a spin but let me know
what you guys think about it in the
comments always curious to hear your
thoughts I'll go ahead and toss a like
on the video if you enjoyed it also feel
free to get subscribed for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon
specifically from here at Computex 2018
have a good one guys I'll see you all in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
