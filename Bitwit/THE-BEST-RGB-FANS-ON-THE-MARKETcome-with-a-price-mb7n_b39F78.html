get $10 off if you order through the
link below in the next two days what's
going on guys welcome back to the
channel I hope you're all doing well
today I am taking a look at the brand
new LL series RGB fans from Corsair
these are all the rage right now or at
least they're they're a hot topic of
discussion because they look really nice
from all the photos and videos that
we've been seeing online but they're
also fairly expensive in fact I picked
up this LL 140 RGB kit which includes
the two fans the lighting node Pro the
RGB LED hub all the cables to connect
them the screws to mount them for $99
yes I spent a Benjamin on to fans just
for you guys I hope you love me more
than you already did that's not saying
much let's change the subject
yeah I'm really excited to test these
out actually they look great in person
more on that later but also how do they
perform when it comes to radiators
because I was actually looking at the
Corsair page for these fans and it said
that their case fans specifically said
these are case fans but then there was
also a picture of a radiator as part of
an AI Oh with two of these fans slapped
onto it so I'm like okay can they also
be used for rating do they perform well
with radiators as well are they that
versatile is that one of the other was
there a mistake so we're gonna be
testing them out with an H 110 i liquid
cooler later on comparing them to the
stock fans that come with that
particular AIO should be pretty
interesting but before we dive into the
results I wanted to quickly go over the
hardware itself these fans look really
nice they are some of the best-looking
fans i've seen from corsair in recent
years this is all subjective of course
the RGB implementation in my opinion is
the best on the market right now they
look amazing
they look even better in person the
pictures and videos that you've seen
even the ones from Corsair do not do
these fans justice I think the the the
word wifey sauce used when she first saw
them today was mesmerizing they really
do look awesome so good on Corsair for
that in the cosmetic Department
additionally the the frames look good
too they're all black you know their
color neutral which as you would expect
something RGB and then they've also got
these rubber corners on both sides for
anti noise and vibration that's helpful
each of these fans have two cables
coming off of them one is a four pin pwm
cable that you can connect either to a
system fan header
your motherboard for example or a fan
hub fan controller etc and then the
other one is responsible for all the LED
control now you would hook that cable up
to the RGB LED hub that's once again
included with this kit
that particular hub can support up to
six of these fans at a time
you also need SATA power in order to
drive that little hub so bear that in
mind now from that hub you know there's
also a port we would connect with
another included cable to the lighting
node Pro and the lighting note Pro can
support up to two of those hubs so if
you do the maths you get up to 12 fans
supported with a lighting note Pro now
the lighting node Pro also requires SATA
power so now you're down to SATA ports
on your power supply and then there's
another cable that connects the lighting
node Pro to a USB 2.0 header on your
motherboard so that you can use Corsair
link to control the various effects with
these fans so by the end of it even if
you only have two fans that you're
connecting there's still a crow's nest
of cables that you have to deal with and
long story short this is not gonna do
you any favors in the cable management
department so bear that in mind on the
plus side the lighting node pro and the
RGB Hub are relatively small I mean they
can pretty much fit in the palm of your
hand
they're super thin the whole kit does
include some 3m adhesive so you can
stick it pretty much anywhere in your
case without too much effort now as far
as our testing hardware we're using an
Intel Core i7 7700 K overclocked to four
point nine gigahertz at one point three
seven five volts that's gonna be slotted
into a z2 70 gaming m7 motherboard from
MSI along with 16 gigs and Ripjaws five
ddr4 at 3,000 megahertz alongside a 750
watt power supply from fractal design I
believe it's the Integra and a one
terabyte crucial MX 200 SSD I might have
mentioned earlier that we're using an H
110 I liquid cooled a IO from Corsair
which of course features a 280
millimeter radiator now I did test the
stock fans first that was in yunjin
Heaven 4.0 I ran that for about 15
minutes at max settings at 1920 by 1080
and the 7700 K shot up to 77 degrees
Celsius within that time that was the
peak or maximum package temperature
there's a lot of sevens in that 7700 K
at 77 degrees as a core i7 as they're
very lucky very lucky results that we
got
but it's not terribly bad I mean it's
not close to t.j.maxx or anything you're
not gonna overheat or throttle but at
the same time it is relatively warm then
I switched over to the RGB fans and ran
the same test for 15 minutes and got a
max package temperature of 67 degrees
Celsius which is 10 degrees cooler than
the stock fans I was kind of blown away
I reran the tests twice for each fan
configuration and got more or less the
same results within one to two degrees
of variance which is pretty insane 10
degrees off of our CPU going from stock
fans to these pretty awesome now you may
be wondering how noisy were these fans
compared to the stock ones in order to
achieve those temps well here's a quick
sound test so you can hear for yourself
now I don't know if you guys can tell on
your end but the ll series fans
definitely sound a bit quieter than the
stock fans for the H 110 I to me so
that's that's great news and we're still
getting 10 degrees cooler thermals on
our CPU nice job Corsair on that front
it also shows us that the L series fans
for the most part and this in this test
are versatile you can use them out
either as case fans or you can slap them
onto a radiator and will perform
adequately in that department as well
which is of course good news whether or
not that justify is paying $100 for two
fans is you know is still up for debate
but at the very least it's really nice
to see that these are not just for show
so to speak now just for shits and
giggles with these RGB fans installed on
the radiator just to see if the
temperatures would eventually spike up
to what the stock fans were able to
achieve within the 15 minute test that I
ran surprisingly the CPU only hit 74
degrees Celsius after 45 minutes which
is still 3 degrees cooler than the stock
fans after 15 minutes so overall pretty
impressive stuff on this end now as we
approach the end of this video we have
to be honest with ourselves yes you're
impressed with the thermals of course
you're diggin the acoustics but really
all we care about is the RGB tile let's
be honest so let's talk about that for a
moment in my opinion these are the
best-looking RGB fans on the market that
I have seen in person and I've pretty
much seen all the main the main
competitors it just looks absolutely
incredible in person and and everyone
everyone will immediately judge their
pants upon first sight additionally
Corsair link is the one software that
you have to work with this which is you
know of course are linked in my
experience has been known to have some
issues it's gotten a lot better in
recent months or years since I've used
it but I did encounter one small quirk
actually only one and a half of the fans
were lit up I should mention that there
are 16 addressable LEDs per fan which
leads to a whole lot of customization
mind you but only 16 plus 8 that's 24
only 24 of the LEDs were lit up one of
the fans when I first booted it up and
opened up Corsair link one of the fans
only had half of its LEDs on
the other half are completely off and I
couldn't figure out why I'm so within
the courser link software I had to add a
third fan I had to tell the software
that there were actually three fans
connected to the lighting node Pro and
that at that point it registered and all
the fans eventually turned on but as
soon as I took that third fan away and
he I even rebooted just to make sure
that it wasn't a weird fluke half the
LEDs on that second fan were completely
off so some little firmware issues that
you know might might need some some
fixing soon but for the most part of
course Airlink seems to be a bit more
stable than it was in the past of course
you guys will have your own experience
as well feel free to share them in the
comments on that note I did have a lot
of fun going through the various
lighting effects and presets that are
available within the software so here's
a quick look in demo of all of them
I told you guys these fans look freaking
incredible do they not yes they do now
are they worth the money I don't know
you tell me let's quickly go over some
pros and cons before we close this video
out starting with the pros
these fans look great they are the best
looking fans I've ever seen in my life
and everyone should go buy a thousand of
them
additionally plenty of effects honestly
like the effects are pretty pretty cool
and you know they're not super gimmicky
or anything I feel like some effects are
just like meh that's a weak effect I
feel like a lot of the effects of course
there comes up with actually look pretty
good and I could see people using you
know long term or whatever it is
additionally it's they're versatile as
we explained earlier and as we saw from
the data these things outperform the
stock fans on you know at least some of
Corsairs own a iOS so that's actually
pretty nice you can use these for your
case or for a radiator for if your if
you happen to be going to liquid cooling
route
additionally the fans are relatively
quiet for how well they perform so
you're not incurring ridiculous noise
emissions from going down ten degrees on
your CPU swapping these out from stock
fans so that's also really nice if you
happen to have a more open or more
ventilated case where sound leakage
tends to be a problem as far as the
shortcomings you are limited to using
corsair link if you want to take full
advantage of customizing the look and
feel of these fans which does prevent
you from syncing them with a wide gamut
of other RGB devices that would
otherwise be sinkable within motherboard
manufacturer software such as asus or a
sink etc also there's just a wire frenzy
after connecting this and you're
definitely gonna need some some ample
room behind your case or at least a
power supply shroud to mask the excess
of cabling that goes on from just even
hooking up one or two of these guys and
then finally I would say this is
probably the biggest deal-breaker for
most of us is the price these are
expensive yes they look amazing arguably
some of the nicest looking fans on the
market and they cool they do a good job
cooling but they are expensive at $99
for two fans I don't care how good they
look most users most Builders already
looking at this looking at that that
chunk of change and thinking about how
they can use that towards other areas in
their system that are way more important
to gaming performance etc than just
simple cosmetics for example if I could
put that towards an SSD to boot off of
instead of just running a mechanical
hard drive or upgrading that GPU of
yours to the next tier of horsepower and
with that additional you know 75 to 100
bucks most users are gonna take that
over straight looks so unless you're you
know building a high-end system or if
you you know money is really no object I
do find that it's a hard sell for most
users but the ones that are willing to
fork out that that extra dolla for these
guys are gonna be thoroughly satisfied I
think with how they perform and for sure
how they look so that's my opinion on
the matter guys go ahead and let me know
your own in the comments below also feel
free to toss me a like on the video if
you enjoyed it it does help a lot that's
gonna do it for now guys I'm Kyle with
bit wit have a good one and I will see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
