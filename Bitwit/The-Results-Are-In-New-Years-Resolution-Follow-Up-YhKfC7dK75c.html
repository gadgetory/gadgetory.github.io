follow-up video to the new year's
resolution survey that I gave you guys
on New Year's Eve a couple days back and
with much determination I added up all
of the votes to see what monitor
resolution everyone's operating at and
what I concluded is that I'll be using a
survey program next time instead of
counting the comments by hand it's just
that the average comment count of my
videos is like a hundred but then all of
a sudden when I randomly decided to a
poll by hand two thousand plus it's like
everyone's resolution was to me
fortunately I was able to hammer it out
and make a chart showing where we all
lie on the resolution scale out of the
some 2,200 users who participated in the
survey a whopping eighty percent are
running 1920 x 1080 for their primary
desktop monitor that's a sizable slice
of the pie that I was more or less
expecting but I was a bit surprised to
see seven percent of users are still
computing at resolutions lower than that
that leaves the remaining thirteen
percent of users at resolutions higher
than 1080 with 2560 x 1440 being the
popular choice meaning that regardless
of pixel count we still tend to prefer
the 16 by 9 aspect ratio also since it's
probably safe to say most of the people
who took this survey our tech
enthusiasts I'd imagine we'd see a
reversal of sub 1080 and high potentate
II users when pulling a broader audience
finally narrowing things down a bit we
saw 1.5% of us are early adopters of 4k
and given the increasing popularity and
demand for the new resolution I think
we're going to start to see more
competition and thus lower prices so
it'll be neat to see how many more of us
will be using 4k by the end of this year
but until we take this survey again 360
days from now that's pretty much all I
can say about these results in the
meantime feel free to leave me a comment
down below letting me know what you guys
think of these results and if you have
any plans to upgrade your resolution by
the end of this year and if so what res
are you upgrading to and finally before
I go I wanted to make a quick
announcement that I will be attending
CES this week those of you who follow me
on social already know this I'll be
doing the typical run around checking
out booths and getting coverage but to
prevent a tsunami ask flood of videos on
your feed I'll be producing just one
video a day basically a straight to the
point roundup of the coolest things that
I saw that day i'll also be focusing a
vast majority of my content on pc
components and hardware because that's
just what I'm into
apart from being subscribed to the
channel you guys can keep tabs on me for
the entire week of CES by following me
on Twitter at forever a Kyle and
Instagram at awesomesauce net I'll be
posting pictures of CES tech as well as
some familiar faces you might not see in
the videos so I definitely encourage you
guys to find me on social for that full
CES experience and I think that pretty
much sums it up so guys thank you for
