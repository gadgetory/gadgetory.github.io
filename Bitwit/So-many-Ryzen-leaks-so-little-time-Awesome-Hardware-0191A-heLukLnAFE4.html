okay we're good I think so whoa to do
that what did you do what are you doing
firefox firefox has a default thing
attached to f7o so this is the first
time we're using firefox on the stream
right at your place yeah I guess so I
mean I've had Firefox installed I just
yeah not usually the browser that's up
for that so f7 does what in Firefox I
need to know this because I recently
switched to fire burns done
cadet browser what the hell's cadet
browsing your Kirk correct I know is
that for Boy Scouts if your Boy Scout
you use a cadet correct if you're an
ROTC correct correct I don't know what
that is we'll have to look into that
your chats already firing away everyone
our goal was to make the smoothest intro
for today's show and it seems like we've
failed that's ok welcome to awesome
Hardware episode 191 it's a site a and
about half an hour we'll switch over to
site B on Paul's channel youtube.com
slash Paul's hardware you can find the
link in my description or you just join
us so you just stay on twitch just stay
on twitch the consistent platform twitch
on TV slash out some hardware we do this
every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time and if you're joining us
for the first time welcome I'm sure we
have a couple first-timers here so if
you're able to catch us live for the
first time we welcome you and we hope
that that you enjoy us that you enjoy
every moment of in savor savor every
minute of this stream as we toast to
life and all of its prospects I'm
inspired this is an inspirational Kyle
that's what I was going for Paul glad my
TED talk is coming up soon so I'm glad
everyone's here I'm just preparing with
you guys thank you very much for having
me
all right so we also have things on our
stores that we like to sell so if you
would like to
Porter's that way you can go to my store
which is bit with Don tech slash store
I've got the screw with confident shirts
they're both very comfy but very sexy
you will actually screw with confidence
at least 15% more if you buy one of
these shirts there's a bunch of other
stuff on there too so check it out Paul
store is Paul's hardware dotnet all I
read about that
he's got the captive thumb screw still
going strong there's a lot of other
awesome hardware merch on here and
hoodies pint glasses actually the
glasses that were drinking out of the
day are very high quality they hold up
they have very high resistance to heat
so if you put them in the washer the
dishwasher in case your rooms there the
the logos the glasses that we have been
using are the same glasses I've I've
only ever had two of these mm-hmm and
they're still going strong we probably
wash that hundreds of times and it's the
logo still on there is no chipping or
anything so wash it very high quality
merchandise that you will receive a big
a big Johnson from from both of us or at
least one of us if you if you happen to
purchase something from both of our
stores
we'll give you a double Johnson and
those are who were I've heard a trans of
the show her just the experience of that
is is life-changing so um we are going
to jump right in to tech news we've got
some leaks because that's what said this
wasn't my title so I'm not gonna click
bait all right you did my click at a
certain point we'd derail from like
making up stuff in our head to say and
just sort of like what does it say on
the show document then but I feel like
it's a different it happens at a
different time I feel like it's gonna be
like the boy who cried wolf because you
know like for vlogs and stuff I'll get
pretty click Betty and admittedly but
but I'm gonna do it so much to the point
where eventually when I go you know the
title is 3800 X Rison 730 800 X
performance benchmarks leaks people are
gonna look at it and go well what's this
video gonna be about probably how's he
gonna stick me on that he'll be you and
your wife bitching at each other yes
that would be the ultimate clickbait
just Pickering just guys it as useful
tech information and just like wifey
sauce and I just going at it in an
argument rigorously all right let's move
on thinking of this separate talking
about do we do we say
disclaimer like oh yeah okay like
occasionally occasionally adult language
or adult adult themes can be we should
get like an official like pg-13 or yeah
I'd be a rated or I guess if we were a
movie if the show was a movie we'd be
rated at all right mosaic sensor yeah
that'd be nice some shows would be I
think some shows could get away with the
pg-13 or the PG from time to time yeah
agent Lee we forget to curse completely
usually people are disappointed there
and when that happened that it's true we
do and we do have some moments that's
true you have some moments that RPGs so
let's talk about our first story here
which is from WCF tech risin 730 800 X
performance benchmarks have been leaked
to alright some user found that some
asshole who didn't turn his internet off
while he was running benchmarks in
Geekbench what a dick left all of his
results just sitting there for the
taking in the Geekbench database so
thank you to that idiot definitely
wasn't me and then so the resin 730 800
X was tested with an X 470 board so
whoever had this didn't have access to X
570 presumably and he also used he or
she used a 16 gigabyte kit with modest
speeds nothing too crazy and they found
a multi-threaded score of 34,000 just
over 34,000 single-threaded score of
just over 5400 and it's pretty telling
cuz if you look at the the existing
scores for the i7 9700 K which this chip
is competing with because they're both
around the same price 3,800 X is gonna
launch it 399 the 9700 K can be found
for just over that the bullseye throated
score for the 97 97 hundred K was twenty
eight hundred and twenty eight thousand
sorry twenty eight thousand four hundred
so again that's compared to the 34
thousand that the 3800 X scored quite
quite a big uplift there and then the
9900 K which is obviously a bit more
expensive than either of these chips
scored a multi multi-threaded score of
thirty one thousand five hundred so
still not beating out the much cheaper
3800 X some some good standing it's good
good Scott good sign so far however
however
Intel is still about 10 percent roughly
ten percent faster in the
single-threaded scores so if you look at
the 9700 kmno okay you actually see that
they are pulling quite a head of the
3,800 X but not by as much as the last
generation of risin ships so you can see
that the 3800 X and single-threaded
performance kind of has this like almost
almost a midpoint almost a equal
midpoint between the 2700 X before it
and the current generation of night you
know ninth Gen Intel chips under
flagship side so we're getting there AMD
is getting there
I say weak has like we're all kind of in
this we're all sort of rooting for the
underdog here but it's it's looking like
this isn't the only trick up AMD sleeve
they also have the risin 5 3,600 which
hasn't been officially confirmed by the
company however we've been seeing
numerous leaks across the globe
including this one that was summarized
by hexxus net featuring el chapo sus
informatica se for Mexico which is a
Spanish or Spanish or Mexican publisher
not exactly sure which one but they
published a full-blown review these
aren't just I mean it is a leak but this
is like a full like review featuring
Cinebench w prime there's a 264 we got
3d mark applications you age in heaven
for point 4.0 super position and even
game titles
there's Assassin's Creed obviously far
cry 5 total war hammer and so forth so
this is a full-blown review that you
could just read right now on the risin 5
3600 successor to the risin 5 2600
before it and it's it's got some
interesting results here the takeaway is
that it's it's freaking crazy if you
look at the Far Cry I just all you got
to do is look at the Far Cry 5 slide
scroll down to the Far Cry 5 slide that
is doing that that's everything right
there so risin foam there's that back
again the the horizon 530 600 is tested
on X 479 X 570 but you can see here it's
keeping pace with the core i7 6700 K and
it's blowing the the 2700 X out of the
water which is a more top
skew it's actually again creating sort
of a stopgap between 2700 X and 9900 K
it's a lot closer to the 9900 K what
about the what about the nine hundred K
up here though no yeah it's still it's
still fantastic but when you look at the
price difference probably of what the
risin 5 3604 is in a launch
that's the $200 chip 200 L or chip $200
chip versus what five hundred and
something for the 9900 k 485 as of this
week okay 45 oh yeah cuz we'll get to
that but it's still more than double the
price for marginal gains I'll also want
to comparison point out they are using
is really information also we should all
this this is all probably nonsense yep
totally none of this is probably true we
haven't tested anything but they're
using thirty-two hundred megahertz
memory mm-hmm according to AMD the sweet
spot for the rise in three is thirty six
hundred thirty six thirty six hundred I
heard there's an interesting thing that
happens at 3,800 where the the clock
speed ratio between the memory and the
Infinity fabric is one-to-one right
that's why faster memory equals faster
rise and chips and it goes to 1 and 2 it
goes to 1 to 2 when you get above I
think 30 when you hit 3800 mm-hmm so I'm
interested to see some tests to see what
kind of effect that actually has I I
heard from a fairly reliable source that
that the the drop-off in performance
gains really fall short at a higher
frequency
someone who Commodus has me and
explained I didn't understand what you
just said so that that you can actually
squeeze pretty decent performance out of
higher higher frequency Ram like higher
than 3600
I heard the cap is like 4100 before it
really starts yeah I mean I've heard
they've they they've been like what they
said that the event was every kit
they've tried up to 4,000 or 4,100 or 40
200 or something right in that right in
that range they've just plugged in
turned on XMP settings and it's worked
yeah which is that's very good news
because it means hopefully it's not as
finicky with memory kits right but I'm
just saying when it comes to gaming
performance in particular latency
between CC X's
right the court complex is that you know
there's four four cores per CCX
yeah and latency between those is what
cause is what sort of holds it back in
gaming performance right so if you're
switching the Infinity fabric speed from
one to one to one to two then maybe
you're losing
maybe the that's adding some latency
there right and maybe that that will be
a detriment to gaming performance but
obviously no one's gonna know this until
it's tested sure because there's because
computers are weird and you might have
an expectation for something to do one
thing and it doesn't right or whatever
there's it's still very the whole series
is are still very much routed in mystery
we're kind of just going off of whatever
leaks that we have here but but it's
looking like cat is confirming and yes
this is the number 37 33 is the highest
you can go for that stays one-to-one
when once you go up to the next divider
after 37 33 right then then I can switch
this to one to do right so it'll be
interesting to test down yes I believe
there's eight cores per cc Exxon's n2o
so it was four in risin - what was it
four it was four cores in CCS in a
single CCX for the last gen or four I
guess the current yes yeah yeah first
and second gen right but if this is to
be at all true in any capacity it's
pretty exciting that for a tuner dollar
chip you could get pretty decent
performance that rivals or that actually
surpasses a flagship 2,700 X and
obviously the testing here is is made to
show that the difference it's it's made
to highlight the the difference in
performance between CPUs as most as as
much as possible which is why they're
testing with a 20 atti
to make it as CPU bound as possible but
most people who are using it know there
are still four per CC X I'm sorry I
should just know for that makes more
sense to me so somebody in chat said
eight and I just rolled with it but
honestly I'm not thinking very so
there's two CC X's per chip lit yeah
that makes more sense
that's right such an information
overload that it just sometimes it fries
my brain okay but at any rate take this
with a grain of salt but you know still
kind of
citing it almost seems as though like
Intel should be shaking in their boots
right now and should probably take
action based on all the speculation and
they should get a little bit nervous
right watch my video on the 25 new 2500
K oh yeah I caught bits of that video of
us it seemed it seemed good seems like
it was really good really good video
it's a great video yeah everyone go
watch that video but you know I think
maybe Intel heard your cries Paul maybe
Intel watch your video and they they
probably first disliked it because
they're like no just don't tell us what
to do Paul and then they ended up doing
something anyway which was cutting their
prices by 15% on their CPUs what this is
unheard of well like in into Intel
history whoa for the last 10 years or so
it's all thanks to me and it's all
thanks to Paul oh thank you very much
for for lowering the prices for the
world you're welcome um we we owe you a
huge debt that will never be paid and
then this is from digit times they
reported that Intel's gonna slash
desktop processor prices by up to 15% in
response to the competition so they're
feeling the competitive pressures of AMD
of course and sources in Taiwan in the
Taiwanese motherboard market are
suggesting that the prices across eighth
and ninth gen families will be lowered
by around 10 to 15 percent that's around
if you look at the high end of like what
you said like you know a 500 issue
dollar CPU at the 9900 K you potentially
looking at a $75 price cut that's that's
insane AMD has a lot going for it though
besides price to performance and they
have greater core counts you know for
the money larger caches PCIe gen for
support which is pretty huge IPC gains
that are still maybe not rivaling
Intel's flagship parts but are still
much higher than what they were and
energy efficiency right these things are
these things are these have a lot more
performance per watt than they used to
and the scalable platform with am for
being backwards and forwards compatible
and there's a lot to look forward to
with this next generation of Verizon
CPUs and of course Intel has to respond
in in some way in one way or another so
price cut seems seems to be the easiest
and most logical option for now it's
their only option if they don't have a
competing product to release right
response
exactly so we've heard about is the
ninety nine hundred KS or whatever their
comes with KQ whatever the other stupid
letter they're adding on to the name to
make it more confusing
yeah that's not come until like q3 or q4
right Thanks so exactly that's that's a
long shot and then that's what we're
expecting ten nanometers stuff to
hopefully arrive right stop yep and they
start there if the rumors aren't true
that they're pushing it to 2020 what's
up I would not be surprised so yeh Intel
CPUs it'll be interesting to see the
lowered Intel CPU prices and how that's
going to affect the the landscape right
because right now it's like everyone
everyone is so has so much like the AMD
hype train is so full and it's going
full speed right now and depending on
these prices from Intel when you compare
you know the price to performance
because that's what AMD has in the bag
is price to performance but if they're
slashing prayer if Intel's slicing
slashing prices to this degree on some
of their you know hottest CPUs it could
definitely change some people's minds
you know people who are potential rising
buyers that can hear the baby the baby
the dogs have now been studying she's
learning words she's saying many things
like ooh yeah and and and other
fortnight other noises court name for
tonight who's her first words you failed
as a parent I would be able to be over
watching if any he's been if she's been
absorbing any video game there's been
some overwatch League going on her first
words remain diva ya wanna have a song
oh yeah yeah
alright so good luck to AMD and Intel we
look forward to testing all their parts
in an all-out bloodbath but more on that
later for now we can move on to our next
story from Gizmodo about the Raspberry
Pi for everyone's been talking about it
there have been significant upgrades
that could let it finally pass as an
incredibly cheap desktop computer which
is kind of exciting let's just dive
right into the specs here we've got a
Broadcom 1.5 gigahertz ARM Cortex a 72
quad core processor with an option to
step up from the default one gigabyte of
ram look awesome the scaling
options are with Firefox I just zooming
in on the blood page oh yeah it's very
nice I feel Firefox has superior zoom in
and zoom out and no incapabilities in
chrome and no strangers are watching you
do it no that's true and so we also have
the option to go for it too from one gig
of faster lpddr4 RAM to 2 gigs for $45
or 4 gigs for $55 if you want to just
take advantage of more functionality if
you need more RAM they have a standard
there was a standard size single HDMI
port on the Raspberry Pi 3 they've
upgraded that now to dual mini HDMI I'm
sorry Mike I'm sorry micro PMI which is
not my favorite because micro HDMI ports
can be kind of fragile I know you had a
padam fail you had them fail on your ugh
for in the past and stuff so it remains
to be seen if this is really an upgrade
however having two ports instead of one
will allow users to connect up to two 4k
monitors which is kind of cool I'm
honestly like if you're concerned about
micro HDMI get a little dongle like
micro HDMI to standard HDMI and just
leave it plugged in all the time mmm
yeah and save the ports on your devices
that is true and then so those are 4k
you can have two 4k displays at 30fps or
you could have a single 4k display at
60fps I would much prefer the latter but
depending on your use case scenario you
might need to to displace it's using
Eric and Holt's missa V 3d graphics
driver which apparently is a good thing
Mesa Mesa sorry I say Meza yes you did
be two S's 1s is missing a pair of USB 2
and a pair of USB 3.0 fourths micro USB
port has been replaced however by a
power only USB C which I am a fan of
that gives you an extra 500 milliamps of
juice and you have Bluetooth 5.0 which
is an upgrade and dual band 802 11 AC
that would have been kind of cool to see
ax on there but I understand I
understand limitations there the OS
system upgrades or the OS has also had
some system upgrades based on upcoming
the upcoming release of Debian
Debian 10 Buster it's making it more
user friendly to
kind of just you know first-time users
people who are familiar with the Mac OS
or Windows environments may feel a bit
more at home on this new operating
system so that's exciting because the
the raspberry pi raspberry Anor whatever
it's called I forget what it's called it
can be a little confusing there's new
applications or I should say there's
going to be tons of new applications
that people find use case scenarios for
this device it being more powerful more
capable it'll be interesting to see what
people actually use this for that the
Raspberry Pi 3 just couldn't couldn't
deliver on so it's not just for it
doesn't seem like it's just for
hobbyists anymore but potentially you
could be looking at a super budget
desktop replacement I'm sure that's
gonna be tested in full when these
things get in more people's hands but
let us move on to Google pixel for what
Google pixel for rumored to extend
photography lead with P 3 white color
capture okay so this is aiming to
capture a wider color gamut on your
pixel 4 device it's gonna make the
camera in the pixel phones even better
than they previously were which is which
is saying a lot because right now the
pixel 3 is kind of like top of its game
when it comes to camera and picture
quality
I guess Apple is still ahead of the game
in that sense because they're using a P
3 color gamut so they can actually
display more vivid colors with a wider
gamut a wider range than an Android can
so if you took a picture on Android and
tried to display on your Google phone
you'd actually be losing out on some of
that color fidelity so to speak I mean
if you took a picture with an iPhone and
try to display it on an Android phone
Android Club that's yeah I guess because
of the camera the camera can also
capture captures ap3 color gamut as
opposed to srgb I think srgb is the
gamut that's currently in the pixel 3 in
Excel yes DCI p3 is I believe what's
primarily been used for like
cinematography and stuff right yeah it's
the film standard right yes yeah so so
these monitors are so awesome because
they're all b3 there's 90 percent 90
percent the LG technically does
think like 98% it's pretty high
Wow an LG did you do a color test in
between the two panels in your video no
my video sucks no one watched that video
no but I'd be interested to see that
because this is I mean obviously this is
priced higher for different reasons than
color games this is like a thousand
bucks now I like a little less than a
thousand yeah
and that's like right we have 2500 very
expensive but very expensive luggage dr
and that will blow this HDR away if
you're all about HDR you definitely want
that one yeah that's very good at HD I
didn't give a shit about HDR until I got
that LG OLED TV and and then was
actually playing like shadow the Tomb
Raider in battlefield 5 is a cop oh my
god where's Heather oh no what happened
your YouTube chefs being dreams know why
they she's doing stuff okay okay thank
you
she's been alerted thank you there's
porn bots it's not cuz I was watching
porn earlier or anything it's not my
fault I thank you so I know that I'm off
the hook on board bots yes so Google was
dropping hints last month like they were
bombs saying that the sRGB color gamut
at 8 bits per channel per color channel
is just not enough to take advantage of
the display and camera technology on
today's flagship phones and they they
want to stick it to Apple and be more
competitive with their flagship shit so
the evidence is all pointing to DCI p3
color game and coming to pixel four very
soon last year the team at
xda-developers found that photos the
photo samples taken from a leaked pixel
3 contained an embedded display p3 color
profile of course that never actually
materialized with the pixel 3 or the XL
but they're speculating that it was
because of a lack of support in
applications different apps as opposed
to the cameras not being able to take
advantage of it so we're all expecting
that the pixel 3 I'll ship with Android
Q on board which will feature and
support display p3 I guess it's called
display p3 on mobile
I still like the original pixel uh yeah
this I mean the pixel two is great
I had the pixel to pixel one pixel dude
although the battery on this has really
just taken a taking a dive really I am I
think I'm over three years on this it's
crazy
well you do have the excel see the
bigger battery - yeah the battery still
does great on this though
Heather's battery's been better than
mine - and she has the original pixel
she has the same guy as you but I do I
do need to change this out soon because
my my USB C port is starting to fail
really it still works fine for charging
if I want fast charging it's like kind
of 50/50 like really aims out to replug
it and stuff
oh no data transfer like really doesn't
work anymore
that sucks I like if it'll work for a
second but like it like it I needed some
magic like angle in there I wouldn't be
my I wouldn't be surprised at all if
mine was the same because I haven't
tried transferring data over in a long
time but I noticed the connector is so
loose now any USB see fresh cable that I
plug in here it just it comes out so
quickly it's so easily it's just just
worn out USB see was supposed to be the
chosen one
I know never-fail I know what's gonna
might throw like a micro USB as well but
what's going on micro USB at least had
some teeth to it over there okay so yeah
Google pixel four that's the okay we can
we can dive into pin my PC lint I should
check for lint I'll check for winterland
an accent always check for lint yeah
it's like check for checking for lumps
wait you did put my PC yeah so remember
my pictures weren't loading on here so I
said we were gonna do like an impromptu
on-the-fly vetting that is what you said
of submissions so how so now you could
go to my Twitter you don't have to log
into my Twitter but you just go to your
Twitter and go to my profile just go
straight to my profile and then look at
the replies on my my tweet so um yeah
for whatever reason I'm not logged in to
Twitter on this browser do you have to
be logged in to I know that but Twitter
is all freaking wonky today it's taken
forever yeah no Twitter was
shit right before the show so I couldn't
even like look at your pictures they
were all just coming up as grey and
black boxes they still are I can hardly
see anything here so I don't even know
what any of your pictures look like oh
yeah Wow look at that
oh shit that's what Twitter looks like
right now guys no Twitter
oh no Twitter yeah it's weird yeah I I'm
not exactly sure how to proceed at this
point at least for for this segment cuz
um it is somewhat reliant on a
functional Twitter it's like how would
we stream the show if twitch was down or
you ya know yeah so you'd be like I
don't know we just have to like not
actually stream and just sit here and do
the show just the two of us but not not
broadcasting it to anyone it sounds
creepy
that's what we'd have to do it makes it
seem like we're robots like we're just
doing it to be in the motion of it yeah
because it's a task
it's the tasks it's on your you're in
the queue and you have to accomplish
that task before as yeah because that's
what the robot overlords are commanding
we are under their reign after all so it
doesn't look like we can actually do i I
see that I see that people are like I
understand chat that it's not dead for
every baby that's working for you that
some people are loading it just fine can
you try a different browser and maybe
it's maybe Twitter just sucks on Firefox
is that what you're suggesting is Chrome
it's just Chrome's way of retaliating
because it knows that we both defected
now it's a this big old blade slow Modi
white screen on chroma yeah no it's just
black boxes I can't see anyone's
pictures they're not it's like I'm on a
plane we could it's like when you get a
plane Wi-Fi yeah split to slow to load
pictures that's what it's like it might
work on our phones but like then we
couldn't show you guys the pictures so
what's the point of you guys sitting
here watching us we're like yeah that's
a nice build you got there I would
switch the the you know PSU everyone
pulls your eyes and imagine and I'll
just assume like there's ketchup and
mustard cables you should get some you
should get some extensions
oh no you should rewrite that that 8-pin
super supplemental CPU power connector
behind the motherboard tray uh you've
got a decent color scheme going on here
but there's just that one thing standing
out that you should swap out okay it'd
be the easiest thing for like AI for
like an AI bought to emulate like an AI
BOTS could just do the show every week
this is only like ten phrases that we
use you could put those responses just
generically with any yeah just put on a
sound board on a sound board and just
like hit them like change that ketchup
and mustard power support we got to do
it we gotta do we got to do it on that I
think we got to put that thing to real
use it's just sitting there
think about painting your RAM heats
[Laughter]
upgrade your stock CPU cooler where'd
you get a sound board I've got five
blank ones right yeah where'd you get
that case to do that yeah well I think
that was the best pin my PC we've ever
done that was beautiful I honestly don't
know I didn't have a back-up plan that
my pcs never been an issue - that's
loading hold on maybe it's fixed victor
news like 6:10 so technically it's
almost been about half an hour since we
know shit right mm-hmm
well I mean I think it was a good show
so far you know I think yeah I think
it's been no I felt like I really
enjoyed the things we've talked about
and all times
yeah why is it loading right fine right
here we're on the same network see at
least your laptops loading them I'm
having the same experience on my laptop
as you are on the streaming pc but on
this system Chrome or fire I got we got
no difference yeah same same bro same
nil
okay the clear DNS cache what if what if
we clear out some of the Dome
patience if there are any oh wait
there's only one well unless yeah okay
there's there's probably okay looks like
there's only one here I don't know if
wifey sauce has been Mike just donated
and said Cheers Kyle thanks Mike I can
look at thank you Mike envy 67 I can I
can look at super chat right now can i
on my yes so she should be able to do
that all right we're gonna read out some
donations here because our pet my PC the
show is cut short sorry to anyone who
submitted it's not our fault but submit
again next week we'll do another pin my
pet my PC next week and if you submitted
yeah and maybe I'll maybe maybe it'll be
better next week I don't have all the
answers okay I'm just a person
super chat okay okay we only have a few
all right Dom Dom DOM the Goff's key
weren't you in Chernobyl no sounds like
a very Russian name 1989 sense baby I've
got 19 cents in a dollar ain't one um
alright so no comment
thank you getting ready there let's read
this comment and answer it with anything
here you go pup shepherd wags wags
a pop up would you be willing to do it
willing willing willing would you be
willing to do a video comparing quad
cores AMD and Intel CPUs versus the
higher end offerings the test is 60
Hertz gaming hi
quad core there's there's there's some
specifics missing I mean there's quad
core AMD CPUs
there's also quad core Intel's but
there's a wide range of those if you're
talking about any testing that's gonna
be done and the next like two weeks is
all gonna be on the rise and three stuff
the rising three stuff starts at six
cores and I could be wrong but I'm not
even sure we're getting samples of the
six core options we might just beginning
the higher core count ones yeah so
there's validity there you
there's validity to the test that you're
requesting fidelity but I want to
promise anything like in the near future
because quad-core is probably not
exactly gonna be what we're looking at
yeah um although doing a comparison of
like you know what if you're currently
on a quad-core whatever the various quad
cores have been viable in the past five
ten years yeah and if sixteen now if 60
Hertz gaming is your your goal then you
you might be okay with a quad core you
might not need a 16 core rise in CPU in
the first place
depending on what resolution you're
gaming at but I'm sure there will be no
shortage of Rison coverage and content
in the next coming weeks because there's
just there's a lot to talk about and
there's a lot of publishers that are
that are hot on it
so um thank you very much pop though for
the donation in comment except we have
soul slam gaming why so many bad reviews
on the Asus Z 390 Mini ITX I don't know
did you read the reviews
was that Sagan why are there so many bad
reviews on the Asus RZ through ninety
ITX hmm motherboard I don't know I don't
know what is the reviews say that was
gonna say did you read the reviews
reader they just did they leave any
words were there words to use it looks
like I've got a 3.9 out of 4 on Amazon
which isn't bad or I'm sorry 3.9 out of
5 on Newegg it's a bit lower
it's got with three eggs
Jesus Christmas my my friggin like new
eggs not even loading like my web pages
aren't even loading right now I mean it
makes sense cuz Twitter but I guess it
wasn't just I don't know your Internet's
messed up maybe it's fine we're still
streaming of zero dropped frames
maybe that's taking up hogging up all
the bandwidth that's never been a
problem in the past is your baby already
like hacking away
there's computing and there's not gonna
ball your man with absolutely ridiculous
amount of bandwidth for what we're doing
even with multiple video streams going
in and out how is this possible everyone
in chat says to change your DNS server
everyone's got an opinion use the one
dot one dot one dot 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
keep hitting one until you connect I
don't know why the reviews are so bad
you should look at the ones on the
Amazon they're actually pretty positive
I don't know if I'd use this board but I
can't say for sure I don't have any
personal experience with it odd now
usually with boards I feel like it's
weird firmware issues weird BIOS things
BIOS sucks so unstable that's like the
number one complaint I see on boards for
the most part but thank you very much
for your donation let's move on to c3
sure sure
$24.99 thank you sir or ma'am cheers
planning to build better place to build
planning a build to replace a
workstation slash gaming PC 60/40 split
3900 X or wait and see with the AMD 16
core is like depending on what kind of
workstation needs that you have 16 cores
is more than enough for gaming obviously
if you're doing it is 60/40 split so
you're actually prioritizing work over
gaming here depends on what kind of work
you need if you are if you are like
editing video editing and stuff I would
say hold out for the 16 cores I mean
it's still not super far away it should
be launching in September doubling your
BS gets 12 core now and then just
upgrade to the 16 core if you just said
that
not enough for you I mean you can and
that's not for everyone I mean you know
having to go in swap back well about
your CPU and spend that much money and
trying to resell your old CPU or finding
another use for it but not coz if you
need it yeah it is for us I mean some
people you know it's like it's gonna be
a more of a happy kind of like a custom
liquid-cooled system or something you
could you could very well do that it
just depends on what system you have set
up now this thing keeps reconnecting if
you have a decent system right now I
would I would hold out if you're really
desperate and whatever you're using
right now just is on its last leg then
yeah probably go with like an 8 core or
12 core and then upgrade to the 16 core
later if you think it suits your needs
better but we we obviously don't really
know for sure until the benchmarks are
out but good luck on that thank you very
much for the donation shop sonic shown
it short show $5 great start on the Asus
pg3 5v monitor Paul review thank you any
plan to go in depth with LG nano IPS
offering whenever they actually release
the damn thing I would depend on whether
or not LG wants to send being that and
so they're gonna use their nano IPS tech
in that they already have on their TVs
into gaming monitors that boy wasn't
listening to what you said say it again
so so it sounds like I don't know
anything about this but it looks like
from what he's saying is that LG's gonna
use their the nano IPS technology that
they have in their TVs currently and
they're gonna bring in its like nano
cell IPS is like IPS is I believe they
have very they're very dense pixels
mm-hmm I can't talk right now it's it's
new its new its new panel technology
that LG has been teasing but they don't
have any actual products based on it out
yet right so well yeah art from the TVs
it's except for the TVs yeah um I don't
know the exact benefits of nano cell /
IPS or like the pros and
Hans really that's a good question
because I've actually done a video on
nano cell TV before but I I forget
exactly what the benefits are
specifically to just normal IBS but I
know everyone go OLED this way for her
labs trigger she's gonna trigger chat
right now
err err 404 oz Tech there is 8 per CC X
hence the 16 core has to eight core CC x
and an iodine thank you Eric who donated
five Australia's yes we figured that out
it was a long journey to get there but
we eventually used logic and logic made
the most sense out of all the other
things we tried yes
there are two chip le'ts on say a 3900 X
and and each of those chip 'let's have
four cores I'm sorry say 39 50 X could
have eight cores per chip luyt and there
would be two cc x's per chip lit which
would no no I'm doing it wrong
eight cores per CC X 4 4 4 per cc yeah
it's still 4 8 per triplet so he's wrong
- chip --let's per tablet for per
processor for remember to giblets for a
maximum of 16 cores
total right for for no 8/8 no four four
four four
yes yep QC CX is pretty lit four cores
per chip --let all right no four cores
per CC X gives you 16 cores per CPU
because there's two Triplets per CPU
and the I have we're professionals as
anyone elses head spinning or is it just
ours thank you very much
air for Oh for oszi time
jujubee's update on Charlie does I'll
know about him or her Charlie Charlie is
our new pet if you watch today's vlog we
actually found a caterpillar a black
Swallowtail caterpillar at the farmers
market last week and we adopted it
because it was literally just chillin on
a bed of lettuce and someone was gonna
snatch it up and turn it into their
latest protein drink or something so we
took it home we actually got it like a
little tank and stuff and it's now a
chrysalis and so really yeah we actually
fed it and we got like fresh dill for it
make sure that had no pesticides we got
it from the same farmers market and it
turned into a chrysalis it was cool we
actually missed it shedding its skin
like a molting or whatever but we woke
up the next morning one of the mornings
and it was freaking just chill on there
like on the bottom of a branch so in a
few days it should be a butterfly and
then we'll set it free we're just we're
just keeping him captive until he's safe
and then can you know fuck off and breed
and die and you know they say advised if
you take a little worm and it turns into
a butterfly and you set it free and then
it comes back to you then it's probably
not very smart it should go out and find
a mate - yeah I have sex with right if
it comes back to you it shouldn't have
made it in the first place because
that's just gonna further the breed of
dumb butterflies exactly so if it comes
back to you you should kill it if
Charlie comes flying back to us I'm
immediately gonna just electric electric
racket him I don't know if Lyle knows
about him he probably does and it's
plotting to kill him which he showed if
he's done MB 67 thank you very much Mike
cheers Kyle $13 37 cents as always am i
appreciated Mike
Randi bear in depth review of Apple
monitor stands someday I can't afford to
spend the money on an Apple stamp on
Kyle it's the tax right now leave it to
Apple to make you feel like a poor
person do it for work it's a stand it's
thousand dollar stand I need to know
whether or not it's an investment they
should make I just I can't do it you
know what
that's what Linus is for lie this is
their to make all the stupid purchases
so that people don't have to and he can
tell you if it's worth it or not
because they've got they've got the the
funds you know they got the bank to do
it the bankroll I mean I spend a
thousand dollars on the stand why this
is gonna do it that's their that's their
thing that's this thing he'll do a drop
test and everything you know all right
that's gonna do it for my half thank you
very much we're gonna roll over to
Paul's half right now you can follow the
link in my description if you're
watching this on youtube or just stay
where you are on twitch TV and feel free
to do timestamps if you're so inclined
that would be much appreciated oh not a
word all right we will we'll be right
back
okay thanks guys thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
