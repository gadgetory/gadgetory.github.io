msi sponsored PC and was like hey I'm
gonna give this away to one of you and
that's still happening but today we're
gonna be pimping that PC out for roughly
sixty US dollars I'm going to show you
how it's very simple as a quick and
dirty video but for starters here's the
PC now it looks a little bit different
actually swapped out the GPU just for
the purpose of the video this is a GTX
1664 and assign one of their gaming X
cards simply for aesthetics just because
it's it's got gunmetal grey and it
matches the rest of our system but the
giveaway winner will be getting the
original rx 560 also if you're curious
on how to enter the giveaway I'll put a
link somewhere in the cards this video
is brought to you by mod mic modular mic
you can fix to any set of headphones for
the best of both worlds high-quality
voice audio superb noise cancelling and
the option for wired or Wireless models
are just a few reasons I've been using
their products for years mod mic is a
great no compromise solution for gamers
who care about sound click on the link
below to learn more now you can see here
the rig is already pretty attractive
there's nothing hideous about it you
know there's no ketchup and mustard
cables I made sure to get the power
supply that had at least flat black
cables all the other elements in the PC
are matching pretty nicely and all
together it's a fairly handsome rig
having said that there are a couple ways
that you can easily spice up the look of
your build and of course I say this with
a grain of salt because looks are
subjective at the end of this video once
it's all transformed you might go you
know Kyle
I kind of liked the way it looked before
better and that's perfectly fine and if
I may be so bold as to make a suggestion
before getting into the meat of this
video I would hope that before you
actually start pimping out the look of
your rig that you're first and foremost
satisfied and happy with how it performs
that doesn't mean it has to be like a
three thousand dollar system before you
change out the cables you should be more
or less satisfied with where systems at
functionally before you open your wallet
for any cosmetic upgrades with that said
let's pimp this sucker out so I've got
two basic accessories that were swapping
in today the first one is a set of
cables this is from up here that's the
name of the brand up here I've featured
these several times on the channel in
the past I've worked with them quite
extensively
that's a semi pun extensions extensively
anyway this is only a $30 kit and it
comes with six cables pretty much
everything you need to set up the vast
majority of pcs I'm only using three
cables today though so I put the other
ones aside the kit comes with a 24 pin
ATX cable for your motherboard an 8 pin
EPS 12-volt cable for your
to you and to 8-pin and to 6-pin cables
for pretty much any single GPU out there
unless it's got a triple connector
design then you might be out of luck now
these sleeves are using PE tee so it's
kind of that like nylon plastic II feel
which some people love some people hate
I actually am a huge fan of them because
they keep their shape so well they're
not quite as flexible as paracord for
example paracord being the more kind of
cloth fabric II ones that you usually
see but they keep their shape incredibly
well they're easy to train and they just
they stay straight all the time also a
good reminder to check which material
you're getting before you pull the
trigger
the only other accessory we're gonna be
putting into the system today is a set
of RGB fans from Asia horse now this is
actually sent to me by a fan so that's
cool Thank You fan I don't know who sent
it because it was there was no name on
it or whatever it gives me a fun reason
to use them in a video so here we go I
forget exactly the model name of these
particular Asian horse fans I'll put it
down right here now the kit you see here
includes six fans but they also come in
packs of three which is what we'll be
using today you can buy a three pack of
these exact fans for like 30 to 35 bucks
depending on sales and things like that
when you buy them I've actually never
used these fans before but I have used
other products from Asia Horse such as
their cables which are pretty much
comparable to the up here ones they're
very similar in price and quality
these are 120 millimeter fans they have
a sort of the ring led design as opposed
to a fan blade itself which I'm actually
a fan of though LEDs also shine through
the side of the fan so you get some nice
accent lighting as well there's even
some lighting on the back so regardless
of how you orient this in your case
you're gonna get some light coming
through by the way do you like this
hideous stain right here that's actually
from a pack of seaweed like the seaweed
oil from the package seeped into the
wood and never came out like no matter
how hard I try it I tried everything so
yeah that's how the stain got there I
know that probably wasn't your first
guest anyway so if you look at these
fans at the end their connectors are
proprietary which is kind of a bummer
it's a bit of a caveat here come on
focus work with there it is so this
isn't your mama's PC fan with a three or
four pin connector you can't connect
these to your motherboard unless you had
some kind of weird adapter which I don't
think exists these have to plug directly
into the included hub so that's
something to bear in mind comes included
with a nice little remote and this is
the hub itself supports up to 10 fans
which is pretty generous and it's also
got some ports for some LED strips comes
included with an adhesive pad would have
loved to see magnet as well but what can
you do probably my least favorite part
about this entire kit is
molex molex we meet again nice yeah
these things are just annoying they're
old it's an outdated connector say this
way better it plugs in easier it's not
as finicky and yah-yah-yah so yeah I
mean right off the bat there's a couple
things I'm not in love with but you have
to remember that this is a fraction of
the price of what you would pay for like
a pack of premium RGB fans I think a
three pack of Corsair L Series fans is
like over $100 it's absolutely insane so
you do get what you pay for
last thing to notice that I'm really
considering doing like a cheap RGB fan
roundup video where I test the
performance and the looks and features
of various cheap RGB fans these ones
included so if you want to wait for that
comparison video to come out before you
pull the trigger on these just want to
give you a heads up there but I will put
links to both of these in the
description regardless so that's pretty
much what we're doing today yeah like I
mentioned this is gonna be a quick and
dirty video because I actually have a
really short week this week so I'm kind
of slacking on you guys I'm sorry you
guys still love me though I know you do
but in all seriousness I'm actually very
curious to see how much we can transform
the look of this build with roughly 60
bucks so it should be pretty cool
okay smokey dokie the system is
officially pimped but let's let's talk
about how I went about this because
there are multiple ways to approach it
so you can see that I actually swapped
out our static pressure optimized fan
that came included with the hyper 212
black edition which was a risky move I
was like ooh are the temperatures gonna
go up because it's just sort of like a
basic case fan but if you see here I've
also replaced the the rear stock fan
that came with the case with an RGB fan
as well so I took that fan and
repositioned it at the front and now
we've got this direct path of airflow
but a thing about a boom and I did about
15 20 minutes of Resident Evil 2 with
the side panel on and we're getting
around the same or even better
temperatures than we were on our 2600
Verizon 5 2600 overclocked to 4
gigahertz on all cores what beautiful
having said that I would not recommend
putting this fan on this exact CPU
cooler heatsink because it's just not
fitting all that well while it's very
close to the radiator it's actually
hugging it super tightly like if I push
on it there's no gap it's like it's
hugging it super tight so that's not the
issue
it's these brackets that come included
with the cooler that are just not
optimized for these fans it's not the
proper distance into these holes and so
the problem there is that they come
undone very easily if I were to like
just sort of move this system around
just like casually moving on to the
ground or something one of those might
pop out the fan might fall down or
something like that
so not the best configuration and I'm
probably gonna end up swapping this back
with the original fan and moving this
guy big in of which the front of these
fans look great like they are super
bright and vibrant the colors look
awesome they seamlessly transition from
one to another and it's a much better
aesthetic than I was expecting for the
price point the only flaw that I see
here aesthetically and of course is this
objective is the side LED on the side of
the housing looks a little if you can
see the sort of internal frame doesn't
look the cleanest and I'm not just not
so hot about these corners you know
again preference here so in that case
I'd probably reserved these fans for
like the edges of a case like for the
back of the front or the top of the
bottom but not necessarily front and
center in the middle where you can
easily see the sides gosh what do I get
so picking the controller and the hub
work nicely you've got about a hundred
thousand defects to go through you can
do this for five minutes straight and
not see the same
back twice it's kind of insane and a
little annoying too if you know what
you're looking for you just have to like
keep cycling and sitting there until you
get it so it's a bit of a downside
having so many effects but no real good
way to sort through them that being said
most of them look pretty cool you know
you've got options to choose from at
least I did not see white though like
just solid static white because I was
looking for that to match our cables
here and there's no white on the
controller like they've got everything
yes yes I've got everything else there's
no white maybe I missed it but something
to keep in mind if you're interested in
buying these fans for a whitening PC
maybe that warrants further research the
cables are looking real maps like I said
they just have a really good shape to
them they're very cooperative I probably
would have gone with black cables just
all black if this was my personal build
because I think it would match better
and if I was gonna go white I would
probably find other components in the
bill that had white accents on them to
sort of spread that theme around but all
things considered I think these look a
lot nicer than the stock power supply
cables which even though they were black
they were glossy and rubber eating crap
last thing I'll point out here is that
while the system looks very nice they do
have a saying in this world that says
pimping ain't easy and by that I mean
cable management so if you're gonna be
adding extensions for example you're
gonna be adding a lot more cable lengths
potentially to your system especially if
you're not getting them custom-made
where you can customize the links and
stuff so make sure that you have ample
room either behind your motherboard tray
or perhaps a power supply shred like we
did here which makes a lot easy to just
sort of organize the mess that's going
on behind the scenes as for the fans
their individual cables aren't a huge
deal but you got to consider where
you're gonna put the hub especially if
it's a larger sized one whether it be
really tall wide or thick or whatever we
actually put ours right here and you can
kind of I made it oopsey kind of see the
adhesive bleeding through there I might
cover that up it fits just fine there we
did have ample room behind the
motherboard tray and the side panels to
squeeze it in there but not every case
can accommodate any controller or hub so
definitely be mindful but I think that
pretty much does it guys I will say this
though if you happen to be the lucky
winner of this amazing PC I'm gonna give
you the choice of either keeping it as
is or reverting it back to the way it
was before totally up to you so again
guys enter that giveaway again I'll put
a link somewhere let me know what you
think are you a fan of before or after
maybe I'll put a strawpoll somewhere
great now I have to do it because I said
it though everyone's gonna bother me
okay guys
for watching tossed like on the video if
you enjoyed it subscribe to the channel
for more tech stuff comment at you
really soon and I will see you guys in
the next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
