brought to you by fantex all right we're
at the fan tech suite they have a lot of
good stuff today this is the luxe -
beautiful case it actually incorporates
several elements and kind of borrows
some design features from the existing
luxe and the Primo dual system chassis
so you can see here we've actually got I
believe that's an ATX port or maybe it's
a ATX you can actually fit ueb
motherboards and here no problem and you
also have room for a mini ITX board down
there so dual system there's a lot of
flexibility a lot of options here you
can actually mount to four 80s and to
360 rads in here at the same time it's
absolutely ludicrous you can see here
the whole system has been custom
water-cooled you actually have options
for vertically mounting both GPUs if you
want to and I love the fact that they're
both triple slots so it actually puts
the card a little bit further away from
the glass panel beautiful tempered glass
panel I believe it's held in place with
some magnets as well as the option to
screw it down I should also mention this
is a prototype case so if you guys have
any feedback feel free to drop it in the
comments I'm sure I'm sure fan ticks
will read all of them we also have some
really nice mesh here it's actually a
fabric mesh that we actually saw it
Computex earlier last year this is
really nice material it actually helps
with air permeation the air flow can
actually penetrate this a lot better
than a conventional mesh design with
that plastic material so you get full
aluminum construction on the outside and
if we go around here look at this like
this is the nicest right side of a
system I've ever seen
you've got ample ventilation and dust
filtration for any fans or radiators
that you mount right here definitely a
good place to put some RGB fans now look
at this generous window tempered glass
4-3-3 mounted SSDs two and a half inch
drives again this is definitely a reason
to get some RGB SSDs in here looks
really nice you also have ventilation of
course for your power supply worth
noting that you can fit up to two power
supplies in here of course since it is a
dual system chassis and of course fantex
already has their own line of power
supplies that can split you can use a
single power supply to drive two systems
at once or you can just put two of their
power supplies in here for added
redundancy or additional power you can
expect this case to arrive sometime
around q2 maybe towards the end of that
and
the original lux was around 170 bucks us
you can probably expect the price to be
somewhere within that range we've also
got some metallic gear cases here these
are brand-new we got the Neogene the Neo
air and the Neo silent pretty much
similar cases internally actually
exactly the same internal layout but
they all serve a different purpose
externally for example the Neo G has a
lovely tempered glass front panel and
side panel they all feature tempered
glass side panels but this one actually
has a tempered glass front panel with
their sort of iconic design there looks
very nice and over here you've got the
Neo air fully mesh so this is obviously
gonna be really good for for performance
airflow maybe your sticking some hotter
running components in here this might be
the case to get out of the three and
then of course the Neo silence if you're
just going for pure quietness and you're
trying to hit that acoustic profile
strong then go with this it's a little
bit closed off here but still obviously
we've got ventilation on the the sides
and the top of course you're just gonna
have a quieter sound profile they're
over here metallic gear now has fans and
a variety of flavors all three of these
sections are available in 120 or 140
varieties over here you have the sky Ron
120 and 140 pretty pretty standard no no
fancy frills probably going to be a
little bit cheaper than your standard
fan because there's no RGB if you want
to step on up to the big boys you've got
the digital RGB sky runs 120 140 as well
and then you've got regular RGB still
looks very nice and very colourful I
should also mention they're all PWM fans
and they all have black cables which is
important to me so you guys remember the
Eclipse P 600 s that we took a gander at
during Computex last year it was sort of
in a prototype phase then it's ready now
it should be ready to ship in like a
couple weeks or so this is actually
talking up to be one of my favorite
cases we'll be doing a build in this
exact chassis in our hotel suite later
this week so stay tuned for that very
exciting stuff a lot of flexibility here
as well typical fantex you've got these
panels tooless magnetic removable love
it so you can optimize it for airflow or
performance and you've got that nice
fabric mesh once again to let more air
pass through than your conventional
plastic mesh is very minimal like
lighting here you've got a white LED on
the power button that's pretty much it I
kind of like it I'm digging it you also
got a tempered glass side panel with
lovely magnet and inside you can see
this the AC the anthracite gray they've
actually continued the color not just on
the inside but all right not just on the
outside but on the inside as well and
then tons of room for activities it does
come with two 140s at the front and
another one forty at the back all
typical great fantex quality fans there
and this is again the same interior
layout that you'd find with the evolve X
which is a slightly higher end case it's
got RGB and all that stuff but this
definitely gets the job done the other
thing that they didn't have at Computex
was with other other colors so you just
saw that the gray went over there black
and white looks really nice as well and
you can just sort of see if you come
over here just like the different use
case scenarios you can use with this
chassis how they have kind of a server
if they kind of have a server set up
here with all the drives you can fit
tons of mechanical storage in here and
obviously the other one we just looked
at was more of a gaming centric system
so the possibilities are seemingly
endless and of course just like the
evolved X you've got room for a mini ITX
system up there as well you probably
want to pop this top panel off because
we've got an AO that could stand to
breathe a little bit
but options tons and tons of options and
of course black black is classic
everyone loves black the interesting
thing about the black one is that it's
gonna be the only color that's offered
as an option to have a completely closed
off side panel so no glass no frills you
don't care about the inside or what it
looks like anyway you just want it to be
silent because all of these cases will
feature the nice sound damping material
at least on the right side but if you
get the fully closed off side panel in
black you'll it'll be even quieter that
way fantex also has new water blocks for
the RT x series these are launching next
week when you see this video it's
probably right around the corner you can
see they've gone with a lot more acrylic
that's just to illuminate the block
overall of course you've got that RGB
lighting that gets that gets sort of
diffused over that acrylic surface it's
really nice and then they've got these
mirrored finishes just kind of rounding
things out it's a nice contrast I really
like the way that they're looking so far
you can see that these are actually four
third party GPUs so we've got one for
the RT X xx atti Strix from Asus and we
also have one for the 2080 ti extreme
from gigabyte bear in mind that these
cards will already ship with their own
back plates and these these water blocks
will be compatible with those
third-party back plates so you don't
need to buy and
you're one that being said let's say
you're going for a founders edition r-tx
20 80 TI they have blocks for those two
and back plates so you can see that
looks really nice I should also mention
that these all feature a bigger fin
surface area and they're going to be
overall more efficient and better at
cooling your GPUs under any kind of load
and here we have the biggest motherboard
I've ever seen this is this is the Asus
Dominus with socket P that Asus and
Intel been showing off lately but it's
it's absolutely massive and the
interesting about this board is that
when Asus made it they didn't really
think about what cases would be able to
fit it and so they actually contacted
fantex and said hey we think that your
case the end to a lead is probably the
only case right now that could fit this
gargantuan motherboard and as far as we
can all tell they're right the elite is
the only case that have reasonably fits
this this oversized board Asus claims it
to be EB form factor but it's not
they're lying
it's actually a little bit taller a
little bit wider than a standard board
of that form factor but additionally
Asus also had some issues trying to cool
their own board particularly the VRM so
you've got I don't know almost 40
MOSFETs and chokes just going across
here at the very top of the board that
the original Asus cooler just wasn't it
wasn't cutting it so fan ticks came in
once again with their vrm water block
and for the CPU and temperatures are
looking much much better now this will
actually be sold in a kit so it's almost
you know kind of goes without saying if
you're gonna buy a board like this
you're gonna want some extreme cooling
solution and obviously there's different
schools of thought do you want to water
cool a system that's intended to be
reliable and also very expensive that's
ultimately going to be a decision for
the for the end-user but if you are
looking for absolute performance this is
a pretty good place to start so overall
I mean big picture here you've got this
ridiculous board that fits perfectly in
the m2 elite with a fan text cooling
system that can handle the crazy amount
of heat that this thing's pumping out
and you've got the revolt Pro to
actually power everything efficiently
and effectively so it's kind of an
all-in-one eco system if you will if
you're trying to run this this platform
with this board alright MSI they were
showing off their brand new GS 75
stealth laptop
guys are probably already familiar with
the GS 65 stealth the original is a 15
inch this is now a 17 inch and it's been
given the r-tx treatment so the demo
they were showing off actually featured
an RT X 2080
max Q now obviously the max Q has more
stringent power limitations and clock
speed isn't quite as high but it is
still a super powerful GPU that's
miraculously been squeezed into this
really thin form factor the screen is
still 1920 by 1080 resolution but you
are still getting 144 Hertz MSI is also
really proud of a cooling solution that
they have in here they're cooler boost
Trinity Plus actually features three
fans and seven built-in copper heat
pipes which is supposed to do a great
job of keeping thermals in check there's
also a back panel underneath the laptop
that pops off revealing 3m dot two slots
so they're all very accessible if you
want to swap them out upgrade later down
the line they're also touting 192
kilohertz 24-bit audio so very high res
it's got Dynaudio speakers with a
passive radiator built-in the trackpad
has been made 35 percent whiter so we've
got a lot more room to spare there when
you're not using a mouse of course and
they also advertise more than 10
multi-finger gestures just to make life
a little bit easier you could eight
hours of battery life still that's from
productivity of course with white web
browsing and Word documents and stuff
like that if you're gaming it's gonna be
a different story they didn't actually
advertised how long you have if you're
in the middle of a firefight
additionally we don't know the price of
course it's gonna be a pretty penny it
is their flagship model in that thin and
light series however we can expect it
just around the corner at the end of
this month here in January so keep your
eyes peeled for that alright so at the
Corsair suite now and they had a lot of
cool stuff the first thing I checked out
was their new line of RGB Dominator
platinum ddr4 memory it's available all
the way up to 48 hundred megahertz which
is blazing fast these Ram sticks look
great they're sort of a matte black very
stealthy looking but the lighting is
blending is super bright and the reason
why is because they've done something
really cool with the actual LEDs the
diodes themselves that you see on a
regular LED strip there's a bunch of
stuff going on around each of those
diodes it's got a lens it's got a
housing it's physically soldered to the
strip itself of course they're actually
did away with all of that and
just took the diode and surface-mounted
it to the substrate so you can actually
fit a ton of diodes into a very small
space this gives you a lot of
flexibility also because there's not any
soldering material it's a lot more power
efficient so you're actually using less
power for brighter light and richer
color having the diodes in this way also
allows you more granularity when
changing between colors so you can do
things like color temperature changes
with a lot more precision than accuracy
now of course there hasn't actually
crammed hundreds of diodes into each of
these RAM sticks rather they're starting
off small so each stick currently only
has 12 diodes in it but the long-term
plan is to eventually implement this
crazy clustered densely packed amount of
diodes into not just Ram sticks but
water blocks headsets keyboards and the
list goes on I mean if you know of
course they are you know they're
probably gonna slap this technology on
everything they can this is the Corsair
one Pro I 180 this thing is an absolute
powerhouse it's of course in the same
sort of chassis that we've seen the
original Corsair one in very slim very
portable we've got an ml 140 pro fan
that's gonna push air completely through
the entire chassis you can hit all the
components evenly and the main specs we
have here include an Intel Core I 999
20k that's right we're actually on the X
299 platform it's rocking an ass rock X
299 II ITX ac custom motherboard
along with get this a geforce r-tx 28 ET
i do claw both the CPU and the GPU are
fixed with Corsairs in-house liquid
cooling solution for ultimate cooling
potential you also get a quad channel 32
gig kit of Corsair Vengeance som ddr4
2666 960 gig nvme and to drive two
terabytes mechanical storage and one of
course tears SF 750 watt power supplies
no word on pricing but it's probably
gonna cost more than your car of course
there's also showing off their harpoon
RGB wireless mouse it's not a high-end
Mouse it's not super expensive it's a
$50 wireless mouse and it was the first
thing that they showed me when I walked
in here the real special feature about
this product
the wireless technology that's built
into it horse tears calling it their
slipstream technology and it's capable
of delivering half a millisecond of
point-to-point latency which is
extremely fast for wireless it uses a
dual band connection so it's actually
sending twice the amount of signal in a
fraction of the time most other wireless
solutions are capable of this also gives
it an extremely good signal range of up
to 33 feet built-in is the intelligent
frequency shift or ifs which basically
shifts Wireless channels on-the-fly so
you always have a stable and reliable
connection the mouse can house its own
dongle which you obviously take out and
put into your system via a USB port you
can actually connect an additional
slipstream device to that single dongle
in the future they're gonna be releasing
a headset that uses the slipstream
technology that's actually really
exciting because you're gonna get pretty
much Wired level audio quality with your
microphone but it'll be completely
tether free because the amount of data
that you're sending over a microphone is
gonna be a lot larger those dongles will
be slightly bigger
that being said they'll also be able to
support up to four slipstream devices as
opposed to two like with the harpooner
GB Wireless so we're at Thermaltake now
this is the level 20 RGB gaming table I
should be focusing on the table - sauce
is doing a great job demonstrating how
to use a table it's motorized so if you
look over here you do have fully manual
operation look at that this is a huge
table - it can support pretty much all
of thermal takes really big cases great
weight capacity you pretty much see if
there's RGB rope lighting that goes
across the entire perimeter of the table
looks really good comes included with
the mousepad or a desk mat I should say
it's really a desk size mousepad
stitched edging very high quality so you
notice that as wifey sauce is going
about changing different characters and
overwatch the table lighting as well as
the lighting in the chassis is all in
sync next up we have memory Thermaltake
makes memory now what is happening what
universe are we in so this is the first
time Thermaltake has ever made ddr4
memory or any kind of memory for that
matter this is their water Ram RGB
liquid cooled memory it actually comes
included with an addressable RGB
waterblock starting off they're gonna be
available in 16 or 32 gig capacities at
speeds up to 32 hundred megahertz that's
going to increase over time very
minimalistic design completely blacked
out so the way you actually install this
is you put all the sticks in first
where's my finger you install the sticks
first and then
you mount the block to the sticks
because there's two threads two threaded
holes in each of these RAM sticks so you
can essentially bolt the water block
down as for RGB connectivity you can see
that there is actually sort of a Weiss
player that comes off here it's not very
long which I like and then from there
you can choose if you want to connect
this to your motherboard directly or q1
a thermal takes own RGB controllers
what's also interesting about these kits
is that even the 16 gigabyte kit is
gonna come with four dimm sticks so two
of them are gonna be real 8 gig sticks
and then there will be 2 dummy sticks as
well so you still get this fully
populated look obviously the 32 gig kit
will come with for actual 8 gig games
alright so we're at the gigabyte suite
and they're showing off their brand new
Oris monitor model number a d2 7qd it's
actually the first monitor that
gigabytes ever come to market with which
is pretty exciting and actually the
specs are are damn good we've got 144
Hertz 27 inch IPS 2560 by 1440 with free
sync one millisecond response time
HDR DCI p3 as opposed to a lot of the
monitors in this class are actually
Adobe srgb so get a bit wider of a color
space there there's also a lot more to
this monitor than just specs it's fairly
unique in the sense with a ton of
features that we'll cover now I'll start
with the cheesiest feature first which
is their tactical game assistant also
known as cheating you can see here I'm
playing csgo and there's a reticle the
reticle is actually not in the game it's
it's part of the monitors firmware that
you can toggle on and off you can even
change what the reticle looks like you
could make it a happy face or whatever
that way you can get all the 360
noscopes and impress your friends
assuming they don't know you're cheating
the other thing you can do is pop up an
overlay everything's hot keyable as well
so you can make it whatever hot keys you
want this is again all part of the
monitors firmware so you're not having
to run a separate app on your system
bogging things down and it doesn't
matter what game you're playing this
overlay will stay over whatever
application you're trying to monitor
because the game doesn't even know it's
there
essentially it's all Hardware based in
that sense you can see here it just
looks like a regular app on your system
and it's very expansive there's a ton of
options here you don't have to fiddle
around with an annoying joystick on the
monitor itself got general settings Oh
anc active noise canceling built into
the monitor so this isn't so that you
can't hear keyboard clicks and and other
outside noises from your friends or
whoever you're gaming with it's so that
they can't hear you
so it's actually for the friends that
you're playing with or let's say you're
a streamer and you're clacking away you
know what your viewers to hear all of
that ambient noise it's actually really
effective they did the demo using some
really crappy earbuds like $10 earbuds
essentially showing that it works with
any kind of grade of headphones or audio
source that you're using and with the
active noise-cancelling and enabled I
could not hear the the blasting music or
the massive keyboard clacking that the
demonstrator is actually doing literally
less than a foot away from his mic it
was really impressive at the same time I
could hear his voice crystal-clear I've
actually never really experienced any
kind of A&amp;amp;C technology like this before
at least in a demo form especially
integrated into a monitor I think it's
one of the most unique features about
this panel that really sets it apart
from other panels in its class and also
the build quality of the panel itself is
probably top of the line it beats out my
predator X 30 for the entire base and
the stand itself is metallic there's
like hardly any plastic on the panel it
just feels heavy it feels like a really
good solid panel they also have a
feature called aim stabilizer which my
high-level understanding is that it Jex
a black frame at various intervals
depending on what your frame rate is to
trick your eyes into seeing a smoother
image so when you're firing and you're
looking at bullet holes going all over
the walls you can actually see exactly
where those bullet holes are going a lot
sharper with that feature enabled they
actually showed me a demo with the blur
Busters motion test here with the
feature on and off and I could
definitely notice a difference it's it's
objectively better with the aim
stabilizer enabled now just to reiterate
this is a free sync panel I did ask
gigabyte if they had plans to release a
g-sync model in the future and they kind
of gave me one of those like wink-wink
nudge-nudge nods and stuff so I guess
that's a yes as far as pricing we don't
know yet but we won't have to wait much
longer till we find out because this
panel launches at the end of this month
so keep your eyes peeled for that video
cards still a gigabyte they have a bunch
of r-tx 2060s here so you get that full
suite of r-tx technology and some pretty
decent performance if you guys watch my
review you know that the founders
edition card that I tested was pretty
much on par performance while
- a gtx 1070 TI and 1070 is right now
can't be had for less than $400 so if
this can actually launch at it's rated
MSRP of 349 it's actually a pretty good
deal
IMO let's take a look at some of these
cards here they've got four of them on
display starting with the r-tx 2060 mini
ITX OC six gigabyte card actually all
these cards are featuring six gigs of GD
v or six memory and this is a nice
little mini card if you've got a small
form-factor case they're gonna be
selling I believe an external GPU dock
specifically for this card in the near
future so the only look out for that
this one has your standard 8 pin PCIe
connector and looks like standard rear
i/o as well there are no actual specs on
any of these placards so I can't really
tell you much about about those but we
can just take a look at the physical
differences of these four cards as the
r-tx 2060 windforce OC 6 gigabyte model
gots a dual fan heatsink design here
this is actually a longer card than the
non windforce card you can see by about
an inch and a half perhaps which means
you're gonna get better cooling
potentially a nice backplate this one
looks a bit more rugged still plastic I
believe but you know these are supposed
to be on the cheaper side of things so
really targeting the masses and then
finally we have the RT X 2060 gaming OC
6 gigabyte this is probably the top-end
model in the RT X 2060 line from
gigabyte for now still only an 8 pin you
do get upgraded to a metallic backplate
because you're fancy like that and I
believe there there is probably some RGB
lighting under that gigabyte logo right
there
triple fan design triple fan design very
large card again really not sure about
pricing here obviously it's probably
gonna scale up starting from the Mini
going up to the wind force but you can't
expect these cards to arrive sometime
mid-january that's at this money so it's
like in a week well that's CES day one
guys that's gonna be a wrap for now
thanks so much for watching and a
special thanks to fantex
for sponsoring this video it's been a
long day
you guys have never done to see us
before quite exhausting so now it's time
to relax and have some peace and quiet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
