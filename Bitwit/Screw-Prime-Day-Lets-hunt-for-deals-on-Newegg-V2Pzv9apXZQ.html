late I'm not late I am right on time
okay my phone still says 214 okay I'm a
minute early if anything and you always
trust your phone's time you never trust
the desktop time but shits always off
but okay cool I can see myself so I can
see me but can you this indicates that
you can so woah
welcome this is a livestream this is we
are streaming here from beautiful la Los
Angeles no one cares where I am but I
was originally gonna do a stream for
prime day for Amazon Prime day but as I
was gearing up to start the stream the
site went down like completely down like
all I saw were the stupid Amazon dogs
and Amazon was like you can check out
the dogs you can read more articles we
have some articles about the dogs and
those articles are you know those are
loading those pages are loading just
fine but you can't buy anything on the
site and I've heard some people saying
that the site is fine now I was actually
checking it myself just before going
live here and it seems to be better now
but I just didn't want to risk it like I
didn't want to risk the site just
fluctuating and giving us issues midway
through the stream it's just not stable
right now so I hopped onto Newegg
instead here let me you know want to see
my face in fullscreen so this is this is
Amazon okay if it's working now then
then that's great
the other thing is I didn't really see
too many tech deals to begin with
when the site was working so I hopped
over to a new egg just to see what was
what was good in the egg and look at
this fantastic they're having a
fantastic sale fantastic
who's running the marketing a new egg
right now cuz that is genius so I
clicked on the fantastic sale to see
what I would find and I was pleasantly
surprised there's actually some decent
deals on hardware components so I
figured it would be fun today to sort of
just go through the site and and pick
out parts for a full build I
we're gonna assemble a full build today
well not physically assemble it but
we're gonna pick out all the parts for a
full list and and maybe build ourselves
a little gaming PC I don't really have a
budget in mind I was thinking in my head
just like you know maybe a thousand
bucks and if we go a little over a
little under it's fine I'm not going to
be super anal demonetised about the
budget in today's stream but I think
really what I want is a mid to high end
gaming PC something mid-range you know
something that's gonna last a while so I
think we should just go down here go
down the list and I'm gonna you know
apologize in advance for not being the
most attentive to chant it's not going
super fast so I could technically read
it without going crazy but yeah I'm
gonna be focused mainly on on the on the
site and stuff and picking out parts so
forgive me in advance if I don't if I
don't read your comments all that
attentively oh the other thing the one
one last thing that I want to do is I
want to crack open a beer because I feel
like I feel like you got to crack open a
beer every time you start a live stream
that's just that's just that's just my
tradition maybe I've streamed to awesome
hardware a little bit too much and now
at this point but cheers to all of you I
should have cheers first and then took a
sip I'm all over the place today
all right let's let's dive right in here
nothing my rambling that was a long
enough intro so um it looks like they've
got this all sort of organized for the
most part you've got all items different
categories here I feel like we want to
stick to most of the categories on the
top row here so um I'm just gonna go
down the list I think we should pick out
the case first cuz why not so um let's
let's go to components I believe all the
cases if any will be under this section
so yeah we do have a define our six here
for a hundred and ten bucks now a case
is something I really feel you can cut
corners on and still get away with a
high performing or a well performing
system there are some really competitive
budget cases on the market now you don't
need to spend a hundred bucks on a case
if you don't want to so even though this
is a really good deal it's the first one
we've seen here I'm gonna keep looking
going for some little bit cheaper I'm
gonna be frugal Freddy that's a that's a
saying that people use I'm gonna be a
frugal Freddy right now so I don't see
any cases here and holy crap how many
pages of deals are there oh my god we're
not going through nine pages just to
find all the cases let me just see if I
can find if I can just type in a keyword
okay and that seems to yield okay cool
thankfully new egg search can be can be
good when they're having like deals and
the marketplace stupid you know new egg
marketplaces and thrown in there anyway
okay so all right too expensive too
expensive
carbide series 200 are 450 bucks that's
actually not too bad it's a it's a very
basic case though it's not a bad case
it's just very basic oh oh hello fantex
Eclipse P 300 for 50 bucks
I mean it's only ten bucks off but it's
only 60 bucks to begin with and this is
a great case I love the P 300 fantex
makes amazing budget cases and this one
has a lot more features than like the
200 R but it's about the same price you
get tempered glass and RGB lighting
sorry I didn't mean to go back there
I believe it's RGB if I remember
correctly come on that's got to be like
the first feature you point out there it
is okay yeah we are we are in the RGB
zone ladies and gentlemen and thank you
guys for donating I see some people
donating chat totally not necessary you
know say it save your money for awesome
hardware I'm not even gonna like you
know just just it's it's very much
appreciated thank you thank you to
whoever already donated but guys don't
feel at all obligated or compelled to do
so for this stream
save it for Tuesday so uh yeah man okay
let's see what else what other what
other cases are here it's an ATX case
mid-tower love the p300 do you guys see
anything else here that would compel you
over the P 300 for that price I mean
there's you know you know there's a $25
case here but it's DIY PC you don't get
that sexy tempered grass there's a P 400
you know for what 20 30 bucks more 20
bucks more so that's not a bad option
either what do you guys think P 400 or P
300 PP 400 for 70 bucks
either way it's 10 bucks off or P 300
for 50 bucks I don't know I don't know
man you're spending 20 less dollars on
the P 300 and I feel like you're really
not sacrificing that much you're still
getting about the same amount of airflow
you're getting that pretty tempered
glass panel even though it's not going
all the way down to the bottom of the
case let's see what you guys think are
we going P 300 or P 400 here cuz
honestly I'm not seeing that many other
great options yeah there's a spec alpha
or spec Omega blahdy blahdy blah
okay the mesh if I see for 60 bucks
isn't bad oh wow it seems very
polarizing p300 P 400 pieces remember
guys if we if we if we save 20 bucks on
the case here we can spend that 20 bucks
elsewhere on a cpu GPU okay I'm seeing a
lot of P 3 hundreds so P 300 is is the
winner between those two let's let's
just take a look and see if anything
else here stands out the mesh if I see
great case would stand by it 100% any
day of the week it's 10 bucks more
though than the than the P 300 so I
don't know I know I'm still feeling P
300 and I don't know it's also
situational because I've I feel like
I've used the mesh if I see quite a bit
lately so maybe just itchin to try
something a little bit different then
there's some slightly more expensive
cases here all great options but I
really want to save whatever you know
random budget we have for other parts so
and then you can get some really dirt
cheap cases which you'll probably regret
later okay you can donate if you want
Wow $20 nation thank you very much to
Leah you rebel you you guys you guys can
be rebels all you want as long as it
translates to giving me more money
that's fine
I won't I won't tell I won't say
anything okay all right um more more
soso cases yeah yeah and then some we're
starting to get into things that aren't
even cases so okay guys I we need to get
this boot along so I'm gonna go with the
p300 man I don't I don't think you can
really go wrong with the p300 I'm not
gonna add it to cart I'm just gonna I'm
just gonna open it up in a new tie up
all right just so I can keep this going
all right let's move on to CPU let's
figure out what platform we're gonna go
with here I'm going back to components
I'm gonna delete the case keyword so we
can once again see here let's type in
processor okay maybe that wasn't a good
enough keyword nope doesn't look like it
let's let's see here Intel Intel Core
that okay but that seems like a little
bit better and narrowed it down so you
got a 8700 K for 350 bucks not too
shabby
that's still a lot three hundred and
fifty dollars is just a lot even if it's
a you know a good deal on 8700 K and
people are saying risin of course we're
just we're gonna go we're gonna look at
both options come to calm your tits
people all right we're gonna look at
Intel see what's available and we're
gonna look at AMD and see what's
available so I don't think we need
high-end desktop here we'll get around
to it I will do a review on my rs3 mr.
the Nick thank you for the donation
maybe I will maybe I won't I don't know
I'm self-conscious about showing off my
car I don't know to the Internet cuz cuz
I'm not like a car guy I'm getting way
off tangent here but I'm not a car guy
like Jay Jay's two cents he like knows
what he's talking about
oh my god stop calling me so I would
just feel like a car noob and people
would just call me up people call me out
already for it for tech like I don't
want another thing to be bad at
according to the Internet but who knows
you know
follow me on actually I don't even like
tweet about my car at all yeah we'll see
sighs 'red heard you're rocking a nice
hardware in your pants okay
yes the hardware my pants is you can ask
why flea sauce about that um she won't
have much to say uh I I can't I'll save
your comments any comments that you
attached to your donations I'll save for
the end so we don't get sidetracked here
any more than we already have
so okay what are we looking at here two
hundred and thirty five dollars for the
8600 Kay that seems pretty reasonable
Cora nines no thanks
okay so I would consider the the eighty
six hundred K for two hundred and thirty
five dollars but let's see what Rison
has in store for us the deals of rosin
is that is that pun old yet I'm not sure
okay red ripper yeah
1700 x4 189 huh it's usually over well
over $200 for that CPU eight core 16
threads and that's it that's the only
option we have but it's still it's two
more cores it's two more cores than the
8600 k still overclockable and it's
quite a bit cheaper
I don't know bros I don't know bros I
think I'm gonna have to go with the 1700
X sorry Intel fanboys but it's really
just about the best the best we can get
for our money right now and I'm like I
said frugal Freddy okay eighty-six
hundred K is an amazing processor I feel
it I feel it's it's sad that I have to
like justify why I didn't pick the other
part and like amp it up otherwise
fanboys will get really triggered but
it's it's a respectable CPU in its own
right but I feel like we can save a bit
more money going rising while still
getting more cores and threads and
probably get it get you a better
streaming experience for sure yeah and
we could save money on a board too so
I'm gonna open this guy up right there's
our second part and now of course we
need a motherboard who needs X 370
though right let's go be 350 and see if
new egg has any deals on be 350 boards
yes I see yes okay thank you you looks
like you guys are behaving in Chennai
it's got a peek over in chat every every
couple minutes just to make sure like
you're not all killing each other
digitally okay we got a few options here
three options looks like for be 350
boards but that's okay I like fewer
options cuz it gives me less to think
about we have a gigabyte board the a be
350 gaming 3 Rev 1 485 bucks for 5 bucks
more you can get either of these boards
a fatality a be 350 not a huge fan of
the fatality boards nothing against like
fatality himself like he's a cool guy
and stuff but just like the board's I
don't know I just maybe it's the way
they look maybe I'm not a fan of the
design I think that might be it I shop
with my eyes first biostar be 350 gt5
bio stars come a long way you know
giving them the benefit of the doubt
here but what's the put the oh that's
like a racing checkered racing design uh
and the reviews the reviews on this
board just aren't that compelling so by
far in a way the gigabyte reviews look
the most promising I've had the most
experience with gigabyte boards and it's
generally been positive so I think this
is a pretty easy easy pick here we're
gonna go with this board so so far we've
got the Eclipse p300 we've got a rise in
7 1700 X and a gigabyte a be 350 gaming
3 board on a m4 socket so uh alright
what do we need now what do we need now
people let's do memory oh this is gonna
be fun so obviously memory has been
getting just increasingly increasingly
expensive over the last like almost
years now it's crazy just how much it's
gone up in price since like 2016 so um I
feel like that would be under components
as well obviously let's let's get a 16
gigabyte kit in here I think 16 gigs is
the minimum for a even a especially a
high-end gaming PC but even even most
mid-range pcs in 2018 nowadays I
16 gigs should be a minimum if your
budget will allow of course so let's
type in 16 gigs and okay and memory pops
up let's have let's say many pages of
memory okay only two pages but looks
like we have quite a few options cut out
for us so try to see our gb for $185
that is a 16 gig kit 2 by 8 gig sticks
and it's a 3200 speed which would be
great for Rison but 185 is still a lot
granted for the Tritons ERG be at the
speed it's a great deal but I think it
might be a little much if if frugal
Freddy has something to say about it so
we're gonna keep on looking here one
hundred and fifty dollars with the
Ripjaws 5 alright at 2400 that's a
contender that's that's that's the
cheapest I've seen that kit in a while
tbh okay you've also got some similarly
priced options from from Corsair with
their LP X alright which it would both
of these kits would match the
motherboard technically they're both red
alright now that's too important and
then we have Ripjaws 5 here a black kit
for 5 bucks more
that's 3200 speed though hey hey girl
hey this is 3200 speed which risin would
very much appreciate so that's that's a
consideration if we were on Intel save
the extra five bucks my opinion save the
extra five bucks go with the slower kit
who cares Intel doesn't care but Rison
AMD rosin yeah I would get the I would
get that faster kit so I've got my eye
on this bra
alright so 150 okay there's xbg slower
Ram dam 100 okay if you're just looking
for like the cheapest memory kid on
Newegg right now go with the team T
leave this team T for smokin 16 gigs
sixth I'm gonna turn my phone off I'm
just keeping it on in case like someone
needs to hold and get ahold of me like
your stream went down or something so
I'll turn the volume down though 129
dollars 130 bucks for a 16 gig kit what
is this 2016
good lord that is that is attractive I
might just buy that just I'd be losing
money if I didn't buy it okay I I'm sure
teen teen teams a respect mostly
respectable memory group but maybe not
quite as popular as you know the some of
the high rollers like Corsair g.skill
but you know they're they're decent
enough from what I've heard and and
experienced I do have some minimal
experience with with Team memory
none of which no no those six have ever
died on me but so that's a good sign but
to have 129 bucks it's crazy alright
moving on here bloody bloody blah kind
of pricey kind of pricey more the same
or the same mm-hmm okay what is this
okay this is 139 bucks again at another
teen kid but this is 3000 speed that's
3000 what was this 124 yeah so 2400 for
ten bucks more you get into up to 3,000
that's that ain't bad
daddy bet that's 140 and that what was
the G skills okay it's 25 bucks cheaper
what do you guys think man I might go
with this one this seems like the sweet
spot this seems like middle of the road
you've got fast memory potential for
overclocking if the board supports it
which it should it should yeah yup yup
yup yup it says right there we can
overclock it to 3200 if you know of
course the dims will allow not sure if
these are Rock and Samsung B dies or
whatnot but um uh turbody bucks all
right you know what sounds pretty good
thirty bucks more I should do thirty
bucks more for the RGB Ram I don't know
if that's a wise choice g.skill what do
you guys think team yeah do it do it do
it I'm seeing a lot of team bro I got to
go a team come on 140 bucks 3000 speed
16 gig kit what more do you want people
good lord give us a break here
okay I'm not gonna look at the other
options it's gonna take all day let's
move on I think the next item on our
list should be well let's see 1700 X
doesn't come with a cooler does it
let's take a look at CPU coolers up into
his house here cooler cooler right off
the bat we've got an h7 crier ik h7 for
$28 oh that's almost damn that's forty
four percent off
that's almost cut in half holy Corolla
what oh holy Corolla and I come from
I've never owned a coral in my life all
right dude 20 20 bucks for H I really
like I'm a sucker for the cryocoolers
y'all you you have to know that's a damn
good price for that and this is even
this is good too you can get a - okay
wait oh I'm sorry I thought this was a
240 I thought this was a master liquid -
44 55 bucks but if I remember correctly
I thought I saw 240 on here look at this
a 240 for $50 for $50 $50 I mean would
it be
here's alright here's the question
here's the question do I need a 240
liquid a Oh on a 1700 X it is a 95 it is
that is the 95 watt TDP one of the 95
watt TDP chips so potentially I think
the h7 would be adequate enough but this
this just gives us extra Headroom and
potentially I don't know how quiet these
fans are but you could always tune them
what do you guys think I could use your
input here would you go with the 240
cooler or would you go with the h7 for
and again this price you can't beat this
price 28 bucks
so are we are we favoring a little bit
of a little bit of extra cooling
performance that we might not need or do
we go with the cheaper cooler that's
gonna be
you know I don't know it's cuz it's
gonna be I think it's gonna be plenty
what do you guys think - photo - photo
AIO
- photo yeah okay alright alright you
guys have spoken
you guys have spoken we're going with
this 50 bucks man 50 bucks for a 240 AO
okay done
what I mean it's it's originally it's
it's a fairly cheap cooler to begin with
only 90 bucks MSRP but still another 44%
saved and you know you guys feel free to
tally this up as we go along to sort of
calculate how much money we're actually
saving from all these all these deals
because this we're gonna save well over
100 bucks here I think by the end of it
so we're good we're looking good guys
next up on the list we probably want to
check out some some graphics cards a one
of my Canadian again damn it I've been
watching too much LTT alright so let's
see we got a couple options for graphics
cards we could go AMD and do like an rx
580 or do I even dare Vega okay
there's nothing there just I just had to
I just had to amuse myself let's let's
see what five rx5 80s are going for
right now a new egg during this deal so
two hundred and sixty dollars would be
the cheapest and this is sapphire nitro
respectable respectable brand and Odin
card of fairly good reviews you even get
a promo code twenty bucks off
additionally at 260 so yeah that's
that's actually not bad that ain't bad I
would I wouldn't even bother with the
other two because they're probably just
as good or you know marginally better so
holy smokes
okay so 260 bucks not too bad let's see
what a gtx 1066 gigabyte goes foul oh we
only got one option here in the deal
three hundred and five dollars for the
six gig model is also not bad definitely
a bit more steel
than the RX 580 probably a little bit
too steep to make me go the 1060 round
but just to amuse myself a little bit
more let's take a look at what gtx 1070
s might be going for oh okay oh look at
this a 1070 TI from ZOTAC who 8gig card
four hundred and forty nine dollars with
a thirty dollar promo code that's four
hundred and ten 410 dollars for a ten
seventy TI dual dual fan card let's see
it's got a single single eight pin PCI
connector I likey all right looks like
reference reference video outs guys what
do you what do you think about this this
it's a 1070 TI for just about 400 bucks
I see a lot of I see a lot of Wow's and
uh yes do it do it just do it yeah man
yeah man honestly I feel like we've been
doing okay here's the thing I feel like
we've been doing really well like we've
been like frugal Freddie is happy with
like the parts that we have so far like
look at this these are very 140 bucks
for rent
so like 50 bucks for the cooler I think
I think we deserve this we owe it to
ourselves to get this card so I'm gonna
I'm gonna like yeah we're getting this
card we're doing a 1070 TI people what a
what a glorious day where we can buy a
1070 TI for 400 bucks or there abouts
that's that's just awesome okay um
alright we're we're getting there
getting to the finish line here folks so
let's let's check out storage storage
has its own little category it seems um
let's let's take a look at SSDs I think
for a boot drive a proper boot drive I
don't want to deal with 120 gig SSDs
anymore
it's that's that's a little bit you know
2016 as well
so let's let's type in 250 gig in this
category and see what pops up we do not
have to do another search at you know
240 or 256 if we're not seeing many
options here but wow 16 $68 for the
Intel 5 for 5 as it's actually pretty
good 76 bucks for an 860 Evo okay I'm
going to stay away from m2 entirely
unless it's to say to say that I'm about
to drive then I don't think we need nvme
at all let's save some money here so I
don't need a 512 gig either damn 52 53
bucks
ok that's 128 53 bucks for s 700 which I
have no experience with that from from
HP but that's that's a contender as well
okay right now I'm buy-in this Intel jar
this is a really good Drive from what I
recall that's a good Drive let's let's
take a look at 240 gig SSDs because
there might be some more options there
mo options here Wow $45 they're just
getting cheaper obviously we're cutting
shaving off 10 gigs but man who cares
team group and another team item for the
win having one of the lowest priced
components in its class in its category
$45 and you also have a $45 silicon
power s 55 which I have used before and
it's it's a perfectly adequate SSD I
have no experience with the team Group
one I know for sure this sp1 is is
pretty legit and then there's a much
more expensive PNY option ok pioneer
damn Oh what do i do what do I do
all right silicon power s55 I mean yeah
I'm gonna go at the silicon power guys
what's the price per gig on that you
guys can figure it out but it's it's
pretty it's pretty good so we're gonna
go silicon power here 240 gigs for our
boot drive and of course we need some
mechanical storage for games and stuff
so you could go one terabyte if you
really wanted to see if some coin but I
feel like at the rate at which games are
getting larger these days I don't know I
feel like I feel like I want two
terabytes not an SSD I'm too poor people
right now for that oh okay
Wow 40% off on a WD blue 2 terabyte it's
not a WD black but it's still a decent
Drive yeah that seems to be the only 2
terabyte hard drive here interesting
I mean internal anyway okay like I
think I'd be cool with that let me just
see if there's any like 1.5 terabyte
drives which are not very common nope
they're not just wanted to check just
wanted to check really quick so okay
we're I'm gonna go that's a pretty easy
a pretty easy selection here WD blue 2
terabytes and I think the last thing we
need is a power supply is it not holy
moly ok boom boom boom and power
supplies let's type in power supply
alright there's a C X power supply from
Corsair for 55 bucks down from 70 that's
not bad but I want to stray away from a
super budget power supply if we're if
we're pairing it with like a gtx 1070 TI
a power supply is not something you want
to skimp on it's what a lot of it's what
a handful
system integrators will skimp on to make
their margins and it's it's the first
thing I always tell people to check if
they're gonna buy like a prebuilt this
check the power supply and replace it if
it's a garbage one because they often
can be so there's an RM 750 X I think a
hundred bucks is a little bit more than
I want to spend on a deal for a power
supply so there is the TX by 50 M the TX
550 m the is t like I'm not too familiar
with TX is TX the budget is TX a budget
power supply TX budget PSU best budget
PDQ okay I think it is I think it is a
budget peet by power supply so maybe
we'll skip past that and instead go for
something long see sonic is a really
good brand for PS use 550 watts gold
alright
fully modular that's kind of a nice
bonus I usually don't like care if it's
fully modular semi modular because semi
modular you're gonna need to use those
plugs anyway they're kind of essential
so but it's a nice cherry on top
and then we also have more CX units the
CX units got to go another one here
that's a thousand watts don't need that
don't need that 850 oh wow oh that's a
refurbished and I want to go refurbished
let's let's stick to new stuff here and
okay okay this is a little bit more this
is 89 bucks for a 750 watt also 80 plus
gold I will stay away from the Rosewell
power supplies for now there's a 650 BQ
EVGA which is also kind of like the CX
equivalent from Corsair 79 bucks for a
750 watt see sonic here I think see
sonic might be our man well its power
supply but there's also the V 550 from
Coolermaster but this is I think this is
a T plug oh this is 80 plus gold but I
still feel like I would trust see sonic
a little bit
coolermaster can make some good units
don't get me wrong there's a 650 watt
master watt 80 plus bronze however so I
think we can get 80 plus gold for for
about the same price or a little bit
more so I don't know let's see let's
take a look at these see sonic units one
more time there's that's - that's not
the one so there's the 750 watt 480
bucks
there's a 750 watt for 90 bucks but this
is the focus seer they're both focused
series what's the difference oh this is
fully modular don't care I would
probably go with this one let's take a
look at the other see Sonic's power
supplies that were on the first page
which would be this guy so this is a 550
watt and it's only 5 bucks cheaper so I
don't feel like that's really worth it
we can get a whole 200 Watts extra with
the same 80 plus gold rating for 5 extra
bucks so I'm gonna go I'm gonna go with
this one this is this is what I want
this is what I want okay so that's
that's our lineup guys I think that's
pretty much all the parts that we have
here so let's let's do a quick little
let's do a quick little add up shall we
total up the value of of our parts here
and then maybe one of you guys who are
super awesome can can take note of the
amount we're saving here the money we're
saving and if it doesn't pop up then
maybe you can look up the MSRP and I
don't know try to figure out how much
how much money we're saving here because
I really want be able to do it warm
streaming so 50 bucks all right I'm
gonna round up plus 109 day and I feel
like it's gonna be around a thousand
maybe a little bit more plus 80 Ubu plus
140 plus 50 plus 140 plus 50 plus foe
okay I'm gonna count this 30 bucks off
right because so so that's pretty eyes
don't get tripped up 30 bucks off promo
okay for 450 so we're gonna say foe 20
haha about 20
I said 410 earlier I was being bad at
math at that moment so plus 420
and plus 45 plus 60 plus 80 is eleven
hundred and twenty you probably can't
see that at all 1,100 1,100 bucks $1,100
and we're getting an 8 core
multi-threaded CPU with a gtx 1070 TI
that's pretty good that's really good
actually
if someone told me those specs just
those core specs I would imagine 1,500
bucks or more just right off the bat so
yeah you know what I am probably not
going to I don't I don't think I'm gonna
like actually buy all these I just kind
of wanted to deliver this information to
you guys so that you can make a well
informed decision on which components
you might be looking into or which ones
might be a great value if you're looking
into building a new PC I feel like now
is finally the time the first for the
first time this year it's I can
recommend like building your own system
because the prices have definitely
dropped down and especially when you can
find deals like this and especially with
deals like Black Friday just around the
corner
things are gonna get or starting to get
a lot better for us for our community so
that's great that is super super cool
everyone's saying 10 80
whoa okay what's with the 1080 buy buy
or riot did I miss a 1080 was there a
GTX 1080 here that that was like even
cheaper than the 1070 I look at GT X
1080 GTX 1080
alright I feel like you it's like you
guys think I'm gonna actually check out
and stuff okay there's a 1080 mini for
$500 with a $40 off code okay that's
pretty good so that would be for 60
that's 40 I'd still be $40 more than
than the 10 780ti but again you're
getting a 1080 out of it and then you're
getting the same deal on this gigabyte
card here oh yeah sorry you guys can't
see so this is the card I was talking
about 500 okay then there's the amp okay
so there's the amp for 89 but this
doesn't have a promo code all right so
this one so this one would technically
be cheaper in the long run
like how all the ten eighties just
immediately started calming down right
when the stream cut up that's great so I
don't know I feel like this is gonna
come down to personal preference you
know I I think the 1070 Ti is a great
enough card and if it's gonna save me 40
bucks and I'm again it's gonna depend on
your budget does that 40 bucks matter
enough for you to to you know to get the
next card down or whatever I think the
1070 Ti is a fantastic card you can
overclock it and get 1080 performance of
course you could overclock a 1080 and
get closer to a 1080 eyes performance
but but yeah I feel like that's just
we're splitting hairs at this point guys
but thank you for pointing that out
there is always the option to to look up
to look upward at the next tier all
right never narrower ones like Titan XP
to take a look at the site next page
cool
okay okay some other things to consider
that you guys thought I'm reading now in
chat is that this drive is 5400 rpm
which I did not see at first I assumed
it was 7200 because I'm dumb so this
would potentially slow loading times
down if you're gonna be stashing your
games on here which I would assume you
would be so let's see let's see what
what other 2 terabyte hard drives we
could get here I'm just gonna go through
the regular search we are now leaving
the fantastic deal system or page so um
what do we got here those are two
terabyte Seagate Barracuda for about the
same price a little bit more fifty nine
bucks and of course everyone's like
Barracuda well as you know enjoy your
two-month lifespan I've used a barrack
like my one my first hard drive that I
ever put inside of a DIY PC back in 2011
was a barracuda and it never died I
don't even know where it is anymore but
for years and years and years it was the
only hard drive I used because they only
had that one hard drive I wrote it went
through so many write cycles and you
know again I could have gotten lucky but
but you know whatever I'm just rambling
at this point so obviously there are
plenty of other great options there
if you're looking for a mechanical
storage not too hard to come by there so
okay so maybe you can adjust it to just
a little bit more you know our total
figure was maybe a little bit more than
eleven hundred and twenty bucks but at
the end of the day this is I think
loads better than what we would have
found on prime day I don't know correct
me if I'm wrong you guys who are
actually actively looking for component
deals on Amazon right now let me know
like did you find would you have had a
cheaper system getting similar parts I
don't think so I think I think new eggs
where it's at today so that's pretty
much it guys
that's that's the stream sorry I don't
have like links direct links to all the
parts that we looked at today because I
should go back to my face
because I didn't really know exactly
which parts I'd be selecting until until
now so um but you guys you guys have all
the information that you need donations
I told you guys I'd read some of your
donation messages so let me get into
super chat really quick and then we can
um wow there's 4,000 people watching
right now good god good god isn't it
isn't it Monday
like I want your job what the hell you
can just watch wherever wherever you're
at right now you're just don't you have
things to do probably not it's okay um
let's see channel a bit a bit did it it
did it analytics community that's where
it is I always think it's so weird that
super chats like hidden deep into the
Creator studio here okay um let's see
these are all from oh these are July 10
July 16 oh here we go Justin thank you
for your donation have Lyle do a review
of your car yeah you know if Lyle did
the review then I wouldn't even have to
be there for it so I guess that is a
good consideration mr. cheezy sweet roll
now with bacon that does not sound vegan
at all my wife would have a heart attack
right before you did from eating that
cheese roll they have a core i5 8400 and
an MS I'd be three 64 245 bucks
that's actually pretty good that's a
good deal
boy yeah if you don't you know if you
don't mind not being able to overclock
and you know you're still looking for a
bit of an upgrade path there and be 360
in case you want to replace the CPU down
the line that's not a bad option that's
pretty good thanks for pointing that out
scrub chub I've recently built a PC and
it turns on all the fans or it turns on
all the fans are spinning but it won't
connect it to my monitor can you please
help me sounds like it could be a number
of things I would first check all the
connections that's the first thing you
check is all the connections to your
graphics card and your motherboard and
stuff like that and then if that's still
not working try clearing the CMOS make
sure your systems off before you do that
and then from there I would really need
to know a lot more information you know
try try flashing the BIOS if that's an
option those are all basic
troubleshooting steps but yeah sounds
like it sounds like a hardware thing
sounds like something some hardware
based for sure I know we've got uh I
built my first PC Zack I built my first
PC with your build tutorial you're
welcome it's the most detailed tutorial
I've seen wow I have never really been
known to be detail-oriented but so that
is this is a high compliment you clearly
do not know me at all but thank you I'm
glad that that my tutorial helped you
you know I've actually had friends and
family members who have built their
their pcs based on watching my tutorial
and they said it worked for them too so
I'm really glad that it's had long
enough legs and has been just a you know
a good tool for a lot of people a lot of
people have built their first systems
using that tutorial and that that really
makes me happy that's that's what it's
all about guys so that's really great to
hear thanks Zack and congrats on your
first build DMC zero one zero three can
you please check the fantex P 350 X the
P 350 XP 350 AOC's
okay so just so you guys can see P 350 X
is going for $70 right now great case
it's a bit newer I believe than the P
300 fantastic case a little bit more
high-end
a little bit more expensive but there
are no existing deals no no ongoing
deals for it right now so um you know
you wouldn't really be benefiting
financially from buying it now as
opposed to any other time
um but all right thank you DMC Glen
Alzate one hashtag RoR it's very long
and confusing strung out name grab
yourself some pie ah I get it PII he
donated 3.14 pounds give ups great
British pounds
you know what pie sounds really great
right now and you just reminded me that
I have not had lunch so I'm glad this
stream is almost over and then tripping
my seagate caught fire the same day I
cut it right after I was just saying
I've never had a problem alive you know
every every admins experience is
different and unique in its own special
way so um you know compute compute
carefully guys it's a dangerous world
out there
people have gotten you know killed from
trying to crack open their power
supplies and stuff and all kinds of
other crazy madness so uh you know
safety first safety first I've never
really personally experienced anything
life-threatening with with with
mechanical Drive like not even remotely
close but uh so if it stays that way and
that's pretty much it guys did anyone I
don't think anyone donated okay okay
