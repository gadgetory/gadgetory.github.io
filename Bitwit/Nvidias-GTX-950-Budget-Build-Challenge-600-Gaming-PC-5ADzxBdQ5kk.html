today I am building yet another gaming
PC not just for fun this time around or
for my dad I've been doing a lot of dad
builds lately this one is actually
because Nvidia the folks at Nvidia have
called me out to participate in one of
their challenges to be specific the GTX
950 budget PC challenge where
essentially I go ahead and try to build
a system for under $600 that's my
maximum budget that I have to play with
and it has to feature a gtx 950 because
that's kind of what this whole contest
is promoting ah connecting the dots then
I have to send the computer into Nvidia
they go ahead and test it and they run a
few different games and benchmarks I
think they're doing 3d mark fire strike
as well as grant photo 5 there's a bunch
of other ones but essentially they go
ahead and put a load on it and see how
it performs against the competition and
then based on that which is the main
criteria is performance how well your
system performs and also based on your
frugality if you can go even below 5
$600 you get some extra points there and
then lastly there are a few points that
get added due to aesthetics now granted
if you're dealing with a budget build at
this price point you're not gonna be
able to make it look super tricked-out
in fancy you know with like LEDs and
custom sleeve cables and all that but I
think they're what they're kind of
really going for is like cable
management that sort of thing does it
look like you just plug things in and
call it a day or did you actually take
your time and route things nicely and
make it nice neat so based on those
three pieces of criteria I'm going to
totally win this challenge it's just no
contest now I'm totally joking everyone
has a fair chance of winning so why
don't we go ahead and take a look at the
parts really quick of course starting
with the gtx 950 there it is this one in
particular is the EVGA super super clock
this is one that I have actually
benchmarked you can go watch my video on
it if you haven't already nvidia
actually sent this card over to me and
they said that i could use it for the
purpose of this challenge even though
this is a hundred and seventy dollar
card I'm only counting it as a hundred
and sixty dollars in my $600 budget and
that that was approved by Nvidia so you
can't yell at me for that it's not
cheating it is super super clock so it's
factory overclocked now manual
overclocking is allowed in the
competition so I am going to be pushing
this a bit further
granted it's already overclocked pretty
extremely but there is a bit more margin
there that I could go ahead and and push
it to so I'm going to be doing that as
well as the CPU of choice is the core i5
4690k now many of you guys who follow me
on instagram might have seen the picture
that i had recently posted of all these
components set up on this table right
here and you might have noticed that
this was actually a 4690k and this
motherboard in fact was a z97 version of
this h 81 chipset board so why did I
change why did I go from an unlocked
overclockable CPU to a non case q1 well
the fact of the matter is is once I had
added up the entire price range or the
entire cost of all these components the
final cost was 599 dollars and 93 cents
or something ridiculous like I had a
nickel left before tapping out on the
budget so what I decided was to kind of
push back a little bit and kind of cut
the cost down I actually got this to
just over 550 bucks by going with a non
case cue with the processor and an H 81
non non Intel chipset right there so I
think I think that's going to give me
some extra points
honestly the overclocking wouldn't have
done very well anyway because I had I
had barely had any more room for a CPU
cooler which means my temps would have
been awful I mean this was the CPU
cooler I was going to be tried trying to
overclock with and I was just looking at
this thing going yeah I could probably
get like a you know moderate overclock
on here but is it really worth like
pretty much maxing out my budget and how
many points am I going to get docked for
that you know most of these tests are
gaining and a lot of them you know a
couple of them are CPU intensive we all
know that GTA 5 is a very CPU intensive
game but based on all things considered
I figured this would be a better value
and probably get me a higher score in
the end if I went with a non case Q and
a cheaper motherboard to really shave
the cost down so that's what I'm going
to do and that was a bit of a digression
there but hopefully it sheds a little
bit of light on on my product rationale
so moving out of the memory we've got
this 8 gig kit from Team it's their
Elite Plus series it doesn't actually
look too bad for the 35 or 36 bucks that
I paid for it so you do get to-four gig
sticks right there it is 6
hundreds peed so not too shabby for for
under forty bucks there for storage
honestly all we need is something to
boot on doesn't need to be super fast
really we're not testing boot times in
this competition so I'm just going with
a 320 gig WD caviar blue drive which is
actually fairly reliable for the 20
bucks that it costed that it cost on
Newegg so I'm pretty happy about that
and then last but certainly not least
actually this might be leased as well
last and least is the case in power
supply because damn this is like as
budget as it gets this is a lodge
assists where's the box there's a box
it's a large assist that I'm just gonna
call it at that it so that it's that
case right there and you'll notice it
also comes included with a 480 watt
power supply
oh god that's horrifying contemporary
mid-tower case yeah my ass it's more
like more like temporary mid-tower case
I paid 40 bucks it was like $39 for this
I know it's it's it's scary so um here's
here's my other rationale for this it's
a sort of super dirty Wow
here that I think I'm gonna I could
puncture a hole through it with my
finger so the reason why I went with
this setup is because I literally only
need this system to function for the few
hours that Nvidia will be testing it for
if it explodes because of the power
supply five seconds after Nvidia sends
it back to me I'm still in the clear and
I'm still qualified that's also why I'm
going with this this is literally the
cheapest combo I could find like I said
forty bucks for both components so you
can really see where I right where I cut
corners here think about it this was
what is a 240 dollar $230 around and
then 160 170 alright now all of this
combined is probably like a hundred and
fifty bucks or a hundred and sixty bucks
so a fraction of what just these two
components alone cost so just a little
bit of an insight there when you're
dealing with this kind of it's a very
niche and kind of rare instance where
you're building a system like this only
to win a challenge is the only time you
should follow anything I'm saying but
there you guys have it those are all the
parts and I've been rambling on way too
long now so I should probably just go
ahead and shut up and build this thing
let's do it it's the first big pop this
game
huh I'm put your arms yeah it's golden
hello Ginny oh it's beautiful
all right this is this is what I do when
I'm filming time lapses and you watch
all those towel APS's I'm just talking
to myself saying stupid stuff memory
jack so I forget to mention this is a
micro ATX board again the case pretty
much determined what form factor board
I'd be using because I I knew that I
could save a killing on case of power
supply combo and it just happened to be
micro ATX so that's the motherboard size
I went with I'm going to go ahead and
install this super high-end cooler this
is not going to look pretty but it'll
work now let's install the motherboard
so I've got my standoffs already
standing off and we're just going to go
ahead and top this i/o shield in here
all right by the board installation
complete so while we're here having just
installed the hard drive here I'm
actually surprised that these hard drive
trays are not utter shite I mean they're
actually decent granted they are plastic
but they are toolless and go ahead and
just get these little notches it's one
of the notch ones you got notches on
both sides interesting did they snap off
all right these things are utter shite
alright so there we go and pop that in
and then we'll take care of these front
panel connectors here so actually I'm
going to do here I'm going to route all
this through this little opening here
and starting off with our USB 3.0 route
all of them through the bum all right so
we got USB HD audio where you at grah Oh
up here don't tell me I'm not going to
be able to reach there no no I mean I
guess I could get away with it video
card will go right over there but it
does look pretty tight I mean I can try
it you can try it right now might work
does work looks terrible down here but
who cares let's go ahead and hold this
sucker down granted I would suggest
installing your front panel connectors
first as far as like power reset and
your hard drive LED all the little ones
because those are kind of nasty and
difficult to install once you've got
your video card in there but I'm a pro
so do as I say how does that do that go
ahead and rub these guys together Oh
family are driving he put the hard drive
baby in there just like that just like
that thing at the power LED get 2 plus
man you know don't matter hop down there
out there go ahead and pop them in there
what else you got over here you got a
you know that reset switch like the back
ear hang rebooting sit ins all day
alright we're all good front panel
connectors done done deal go ahead and
plug it must say the drought all over
here alright let's go ahead and move on
to the dreadful power supply cables here
studying with our big guy boom met at
the top curving around
dammit - yeah
they're just like dirt okay didn't I say
- poor baby I won't be surprised if some
of you inscribe after watching this
video hell I'm I unsubscribe why the
hell I subscribe from me oh god I'll do
make good videos anymore Kyle
apparently my alter ego in building a
computer is an illiterate redneck so
there is a little bit of a cutout here
for power supply or for the motherboard
now bear in mind this power supply only
has a four pin EPS CPU connector
motherboard on the other hand is an
eight pin now you can still plug in a 4
pin plug from power supply into an 8-pin
connector on your motherboard the only
thing is is that you won't really have
much overclocking potential but that's
ok because we're not over here
beam em in a unlocks Q on your CPU so
that is just fine for now now I can just
get this damn plug-in damn Oh
redneck how will be put right at ease
yeah yeah oh yeah so quick sidenote here
you guys may have realized that since
this power supply only has a four pin
CPU connector it probably doesn't have
an 8 pin PCIe connector either and you
would be correct in that assumption
instead it's got two molex plugs right
here so we're going to use some adapters
to get this video card powered I do have
these two adapters here they are
identical it's essentially molex to
6-pin so we're going to go ahead and
wire these up to our power supply cables
I've actually had these adapters lying
around just for several months maybe
even years they're just kind of taken
from other video cards that I've honed
in the past or that I still own and that
I thought I'd never have a use for but
here we are and then alright so we've
got we've got our adapters wired in
there so now we have two 6-pin
connectors
coming from the power supply essentially
which is one step closer I suppose to
getting connected to the video card so
missing piece of the puzzle is this guy
right here you basically got two female
6 pin PCI II going to 1/8 in male so
we're going to go ahead and plug these
in like so definitely a kind of a
long-winded workaround to get this thing
going but it is going to work I assure
you and now
voila power men crave it
women want it since these little molex
connectors here coming off of these
adapters aren't being used for anything
I'm just going to go ahead and clip them
off just because it'll clean up a little
bit of the cable management to make
things a bit more tidy so here we go you
uh you get squeamish easily suggest
looking away yes of circumcising cables
apparently it feels better for the
female connectors alright then we're at
the final stretch folks let's go ahead
and wrap this up
looking on camera look all right looking
good yeah yeah ah all right
we've made it over to the other side of
the case going to go ahead and plug this
guy in because we do want at least that
pain running for a little bit of airflow
it is set to exhaust I if I was using
the system long term I'd probably flip
it to intake because it is the only case
man I'd rather have positive air
pressure than negative air pressure
speaking of which this is a great time
to mention my you stay positive shirt
which you can see right here
stay positive now for sale on the
awesomesauce merch store look at that
like I see the blue arrows the intake
more intake les exhaust positive air
pressure yeah that's just a positive a
boob sag and and in belly sweat are not
included so you'll be rest assured that
this is a sanitary shirt from the get-go
go ahead and check him out guys I don't
know if I'm gonna be restocking them so
eat that eat it up all right I
think that's pretty much gonna do it for
cable management so then you need one
more guy right here that surprisingly
has a decent amount of room behind the
motherboard tray you don't get an inch
or anything like that it's probably more
like a half an inch I'd say a lot of
cases at this price point don't have any
kind of cable routing options behind
here it's just literally flat but I
think we're pretty much wrapped up here
guys so let's go ahead and try to put it
putting the side panel on it's always a
good indication if you've done enough
cable management properly if the side
panel goes on with relative ease which
it it does I just know you've been I
can't
in there there we go not sure what that
was about all right let's see what test
moot looking in putting in everyone
power on power button down go hmm come
on I hear it there we go
CPU fan looks good and the GPU fans are
spinning yes that is good that is good
the video card is working the adapter
situation here a little Frankenstein
solution has been a success now I'm just
going to go ahead and plug this into a
monitor because that's still still need
to get a video signal that might not
happen I don't I don't yet all right and
here is the computer yes listen to it
hum it's actually fairly quiet and here
it is installing currently installing
Windows 8.1 pro which is a good
indication that I have built this thing
successfully at least for now there are
no red flags like I said it'll probably
give this power supply a few weeks
before it explodes but in the meantime
for the purpose of this contest I'm
pretty happy with how it turned out
honestly this isn't a bad system apart
from the power supply which you can swap
out it's not it's not riveted so you can
just it's got four standard Phillips
head screws there you can just swap this
power supply output a decent one in
there that's maybe 80 plus bronze or you
know from a brand that you trust and
honestly this is a fairly decent system
that can do 1080 gaming at high settings
for most triple-a titles right now which
is pretty damn good for a five hundred
and fifty dollar system if I do say so
myself so I'm pretty happy with what I
accomplished today you guys let me know
in the comments what you think if you
guys think I'm totally screwed in this
challenge or do you think I stand a
chance against the competition and yeah
also let me know what you thought of the
build the actual format usually I do a
time lapse as you guys are familiar with
I've been doing a lot of those lately
decided to switch it up a bit this time
around so let me know which one you like
better or if you would kind of like a
mixture of the two because I definitely
see the the pros and cons to each but
that's gonna do for now guys go ahead
and like this video if you enjoyed it
