awesomesauce news today I'll be doing a
review on this case from Lee Ann Lee
this is their PCB 3 5 8 and I think it
came out at the turn of this year either
late last year or very earlier this year
so it's been out for a few months but I
managed to get my hands on a review
sample so I thought I would give my own
personal take on it
since it's been out for a little while
now there are a few really good reviews
already out online that I've seen
Dmitriy from Hardware conducts does a
really awesome review of this case so go
ahead and check that out if you haven't
seen it yet now one message I did want
to send out to Lee and Lee before we get
into the meat of this review and I say
this with all due respect is to perhaps
consider changing the names of your PC
cases to something other than a random
string of numbers and letters and I feel
like that would be a smart branding move
it would make the case names a bit more
memorable to the average consumer and I
only say that because I love you guys's
products a lot and I would like to see
your company become even more popular
than it already is
so just a suggestion if you're looking
on ideas on where to begin
I really don't have any leads but you
guys are a pretty innovative company I'm
sure you guys can figure it out with
that said why don't we get on to the
review the PCB 3 5/8 is an extremely
well-built full aluminum micro ATX
chassis and an early descendant of the
monolith from 2001 Space Odyssey coming
in at twelve point seven five inches
wide fifteen point three five inches
deep at eleven point two five inches
tall the full aluminum construction
keeps the case fairly resistant to
fingerprints which is perfect since the
simple yet elegant design makes you want
to put your filthy hands all over it at
the front is a slot for a slim optical
drive a power button and two 120
millimeter intake fans both sides of the
case have generous ventilation for your
fans and video card and also on the
right side are two USB 3 ports and your
mic and headphone jacks in the rear our
four PCIe slots since once again this is
a micro ATX case you get some
ventilation above your i/o panel a 120
millimeter exhaust fan and a removable
power supply bracket held in place by
four thumb screws on the bottom of the
case our for circular feet with rubber
pads that have a nice silver finish
around them that contrasts nicely with
the otherwise all-black exterior I will
say however that I'm a bit surprised
that there's no bottom ventilation for
the power supply it feels like it would
have been easy to punch a few holes in
the bottom to let some extra air in but
you know what is all pretty
straightforward as far as the exterior
goes but things start to get a little
more interesting when we
look inside to access the innards of the
case simply pull off the tool as side
panels which pop right off of the frame
from there remove the three thumb screws
at the back of the case in order to fold
down the top and front panel which as
you can see here is one continuous piece
of aluminum and for some reason it
reminds me of those Mighty Max toys that
I used to play with as a kid tried to
survive Dino lab and the killer team
like so true you'll never miss the panel
is held in place by two hinges that like
the rest of the case feels sturdy and
secure the two three pin intake fans are
also tooless and can be removed by
sliding them up and lifting them off of
the mounting holes each fan has a
twist-off dust filter for quick and easy
cleaning which your wife or girlfriend
will appreciate it's also worth noting
that the fans mainly provide air to the
lower half of the case where only the
drive cages and power supply sit so I
would actually recommend going with a
liquid cooling solution for your CPU
speaking of which the PCV 3 v 8 features
a long bracket with mounting points for
either two 120 millimeter fans or a 240
millimeter water cooling radiator
removing the two thumb screws allows it
to swivel away from the motherboard tray
making the installation process easier
for people with two hands right smack on
the face of the motherboard tray our
mounting points for two two and a half
inch drives I see this posing a
potential inconvenience as one of the
drives would be partially mounted right
underneath that 240 millimeter radiator
this could make uninstalling an SSD a
hassle something I haven't experienced
since the time I thought adhesive velcro
was just a mix of superglue and lint the
case supports video cards up to 13
inches in length and CPU cooler towers
up to 13 centimeters tall standoffs are
pre-installed and there are two rubber
grommets in the motherboard tray for
routing cables one near the top left
corner for your CPU cable and one on the
right side for everything else
unfortunately this second grommet is
severely blocked by one of the two Drive
cages beneath it this makes it near
impossible to pass all those cables
through without either permanently
removing the cage or investing in a
portal gun and that brings us to the
lower chamber of this chassis the two
Drive cages come pre-installed with
rubber grommets and support three three
and a half inch mounts each supporting a
total of six mechanical hard drives
one critique here is that the mounts are
solely for three and a half inch drives
so you're really limited to just two
SSDs in this case unless you pick up an
adapter now earlier I was a little
concerned when I saw that there was no
bottom ventilation for the powers
why but as it turns out there's an
elevated rubberized platform for the
unit to sit on so as long as you don't
buy a cheap power supply that shoots
flames out the back this shouldn't pose
too much of a threat according to the
manufacturer the case supports power
supplies up to 20 centimetres long
however that leaves little room for the
cables attached to it due to that damn
hard drive cage that just seems to keep
getting in the way you know that one
friend in your group that no one really
likes yeah this is him so to be on the
safe side I would suggest using a power
supply 18 centimeters or shorter the
confusing thing here is that there's a
lot of free space in the bottom chamber
of the chassis so it seems like it would
have been feasible to place this cage in
a less obtrusive location to sum up the
PCV 3 5/8 is built like a tank with its
full aluminum construction and in my
opinion looks absolutely stunning it
incorporates a thoughtful amount of
tooless design has excellent water
cooling support and manages to fit a
healthy amount of sizable hardware for a
case of its form factor unfortunately it
falls short in accommodating some of the
components with ease in terms of
hardware layout and cable management and
unless you're okay with parting with
that awkwardly placed hard drive cage
the build process can prove to be a
frustrating task let me know what you
guys think about this case in the
comments below and what you'd like to
see in a similar future case from Lian
Li I'm Calvin Bosma saws news thank you
guys so much for watching this video be
sure to give me a like if you enjoyed it
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
