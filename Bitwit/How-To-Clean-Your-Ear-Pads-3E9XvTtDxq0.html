up guys welcome back to the channel
today I'll be taking care of something
that I have put off for way too long now
cleaning the velour pads of my
beyerdynamic dt 880 pros now I bought
these things back in January of 2013
almost two years ago for their
outstanding sound quality and their
supreme level of comfort but in recent
months I've noticed they don't feel
quite as cozy on my ears as they used to
so what changed did my standards for
comfort go up since I no longer wear
pants to work maybe but a more likely
cause is the amount of dust and skin
oils that have built up around the ear
cups over time after all I use these
cans almost every single day often for
hours at a time while I'm editing
amazing videos eventually all of that
accumulated grime makes the velour
fibers clump together and lose their
delicate softness I used to fall asleep
wearing these headphones now they keep
me up at night while pimp Kyle wants to
throw money of the problem and buy a new
pair of ear pad replacements tech tuber
salary Kyle is asking how do we clean
them so I've decided to be thrifty and
make a basic video showing off how to
easily restore a pair of velour your
pads the process is really quite simple
first remove the ear pads from your
headphones the dt8 8e pads have a thin
lip that goes around the outer edge of
the plastic ear cups grab one area of
the pad by its fabric and gently pull
away from the ear cup until it slips off
then bust out a lint roller to collect
any crud that may be resting on the
surface of the ear pads next fill a bowl
with warm water and mix in 1 teaspoon of
laundry detergent now it's time for the
ear pads to go for a swim
squeeze the ear pads when they're
underwater to soak everything in then
gently scrub them all over with your
fingers making sure to get deep into the
fabric remember that gaming marathon you
had last summer when the AC was broken a
good portion of your bodily secretions
produced that day still lives on inside
of your ear pads if you weren't
scrubbing good before you are now once
you've given them a proper washing
squeeze out most of the water and drop
them into a second bowl filled with
water at room temperature rinse
thoroughly before giving them one last
squeeze and leaving them out to air dry
once they're completely dry give them
one last lint roll and reattach them to
your headphones
I should point out that the ear fitting
on the dt8 80s is pretty damn tight so
you'll have to be assertive when putting
them back on after all is said and done
the final result has my two year old
headphones looking and feeling like
brand new this was a super quick way to
revitalize my cans and could have only
been made easier if I wasn't making a
video about it join me next time when I
discuss how to make a video about
cleaning your ear pads as Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
