network today I'm checking out a PC
streaming device from our friends at
NZXT at just $99 dokgo is more than just
proof that NZXT has a knack for
four-letter words that don't make sense
rather it's a device that allows you to
stream from any PC in your house to
virtually any TV in your house
that means tasks such as web browsing
media playback and even PC gaming can be
achieved from the comfort of your own
living room without having to invest in
something like a home theater PC now
this isn't to be confused with a mini PC
since your desktop computer still does
all of the heavy lifting of processing
those various tasks at that point a
signal carrying that information is sent
over your local network to the dokgo to
be decoded and then displayed on
whichever TV it's connected to it may
sound like sorcery but I assure you
there are no hats involved now granted
don't be surprised if the image or
playback quality on your TV doesn't
match up to what you natively experience
on your desktop since sending all of
that data over a LAN connection at full
quality would simply take too long and
introduce things like lag into the
equation the data is first compressed
into smaller pieces in order to achieve
a smooth user experience but this of
course comes with the price of decreased
quality and this is true with any
streaming device not just the dokgo
nature of the beast I suppose at any
rate the doko is capable of outputting a
1080p signal at a continuous 30 frames
per second now by continuous I mean the
frame rate on your TV never dips below
30 nor does it ever go above so while I
speculate gameplay experience on the
doko might be somewhat akin to that of a
console you would be receiving a
constant framerate at all times now that
being said I think it'd be a smart move
on NZXT teased part to make a 60fps
model sometime in the future targeted at
more ambitious gamers the device itself
has a matte black finish with a
rubberized coating and some branding on
the top a power button on the front and
four USB 2.0 ports for your keyboard
mouse and other peripherals you can find
a list on NZXT website of compatible
peripherals but chances are most devices
not listed will also work just fine I
had absolutely no issues using my k70
RGB
and rocket taeyeon neither of which were
on the list finally on the back is a
port for DC power HDMI 3.5 millimeter
audio and gigabit ethernet device also
comes included with power and Ethernet
cables here's a look at the specs which
may seem underwhelming at first but
remember all of the processing is
handled by your PC the dokos main job
again is to decode the signal into a
format that can be displayed on your
television so how do the specs measure
up to the task of hand
join me on my quest to find the answer
to the question that I just asked
alright guys so I have now the dokgo
hooked up to my television in my living
room television who says television
anymore my TV it's hooked up to my TV
and that's via HDMI I've also got the
ethernet cable connected to the back it
doesn't support Wi-Fi so you got to get
that you connect connection going and
also power of course to my power outlet
so right here oh by the way I've already
installed the dokgo software on the
desktop system in my office so that's
the system that I'm going to be
streaming from so with that software
installed and run actively running on my
system you can just power up the dokgo
as soon as it's hooked up properly and
it'll take you to this kind of menu
screen if you will where it actually
shows you all of your connected
computers and you can connect multiple
computers to the dokgo so that you can
basically access any PC in your
household
so just for demo purposes I only have
that one desktop hooked up right now so
here it is there's a nice screen shot of
my desktop as it currently is and you
can hit the play button to initiate the
streaming process happens pretty quickly
and all of a sudden I'm seeing a
mirrored image of what my desktop in my
office is actually showing so here it is
you can minimize the doko software which
is super lightweight by the way which is
nice oh also something I wanted to
mention is that the monitor that I'm
currently streaming from in my office is
2560 by 1440 the doko software did
request that I bump it down to 1920 by
1080 to get the bit the best possible
picture when streaming so I had to do
that just just a note but let's jump
into web browsing here I'm gonna open up
Chrome and just go
and I don't know let's just give us some
basic searching this is really just shut
up phone shut up this is basically just
a really quick real-world experience
this is the first time I've actually
powered on the doko and used it myself
so everything you're seeing right now is
my initial impressions I've not messed
with it before this filming process that
you're seeing right now so everything
you're seeing is it's not scripted it's
not planned I'm just kind of going
through the motions to see what kind of
user experience I get so web-browsing
seems okay there is a bit of input lag
it's just very slight a couple of
milliseconds which doesn't really matter
much when you're doing basic tasks like
web browsing but however if you are
doing like a competitive gaming or
you're even playing a game that requires
really fast paced like response time
then you might want to opt for a
different solution just because you want
to get the fastest possible reaction as
you can but this looks pretty good
I'm pretty there's nothing wrong nothing
stands out to me here oh I opened up
some virtual keyboard oh oh is that kind
of keyboard and obviously audio is
carried by that HDMI connection so you
do get a beautiful audio coming out all
right that's enough that oh you know
what do we do a YouTube video will do
YouTube video really quick so there is a
bit of miss matching with the video and
audio you can see my words don't exactly
line up with my mouth I'll let you watch
a little bit more so it's not exactly
one to one right and that's because
you're dealing with decoding times from
the processing power of the Doku itself
which by the way is just a hundred bucks
so it's not like the state of the art
decoding software or hardware but you're
also dealing with the bandwidth issue of
you know internet speeds and whatnot
your bandwidth there so I don't know
let's let's try to go to something other
than dialogue
so obviously this part is watchable
obviously it's not as smooth as I'd be
watching it organically from my desktop
itself but it is watchable if you're in
a group of people and you want to show
them something but you don't have a PC
connected to your living room TV this
would be a good good solution for that
like I said and as you just witness the
dialog thing when people are talking at
least with YouTube videos doesn't
exactly match up as much as I'd like it
to so bear that in mind but that's not
the only test we're running today as far
as video playback okay so the next video
playback test I want to do is actually
trying to play a video that I have state
saved on to my desktop
locally so I've got a few videos here
let's let's watch theory this is this is
the Brad Pitt one with tanks I believe
very violent rated-r movie so if you
guys are younger than 17 and you're
without a parent make sure that you
respond accordingly and spoiler alert in
case you haven't seen this movie before
and you're dying to know what happens in
the end I won't skip to the end just for
you all right so let's check it out all
right so the audiovisual sync is not
nearly as bad as it was with the YouTube
video that I just showed you and it's
very watchable also video quality isn't
necessarily blu-ray quality as as this
is a blu-ray rip at 1080 but again it is
very watchable going to an action scene
I can skip around here also looks pretty
clean nothing really there's no lag
whatsoever video playback is buttery
smooth which is nice to see and audio
and video is coming through pretty
decent alright so that's good for video
playback now I'm gonna try doing
something that many of you are probably
interested in and which is gaming so I'm
gonna fire up steam actually seems
already fired up and I'm gonna open up
evolve which is like as recent of a game
as it gets just launched earlier this
week and I'm gonna do some multiplayer
so we're gonna stress test pretty much
everything here bandwidth limitations
decoding this is a triple-a title it's
not exactly lightweight by any means you
for like a decent GPU so I'm gonna go
skirmish and we're just gonna see how
effectively I can actually play or enjoy
a game streaming from this little box so
little penis when I make a fast turn
like again a little bit of input lag you
really do sense it a little bit when
you're when you're gaming like that
little jump that I just did had it just
a split second a few milliseconds of lag
that's you know it's just a few
milliseconds but when you're actually
playing a game you feel it a lot more as
far as graphics wise and quality wise I
I would compare this to it to a console
a current gen console like at ps4 and
Xbox 360
I'm sorry an Xbox one whatever they call
it it's it's pretty much on par with
that alright so I'm in the heat of
battle right now we finally got a hold
of the monster i trapped him pretty good
he just evolved then he's pretty pissed
but his back turned to me right now so I
know no he doesn't nobody doesn't
where'd he go
so a little bit of choppiness I'm not
gonna lie it's not the smoothest
playback but like everything everything
else with the doko it's it's not the
best but it is doable and it is usable
and it is washable it is playable just
you know it's a hundred bucks so you
can't really fault it for for not doing
everything at tip-top performance I
probably wouldn't suggest it for
something like this or for battlefield 4
even maybe for smaller games like
Bastion for example a lot of indie games
maybe Portal 2 would be a good option
nothing super intensive especially when
its bandwidth heavy like a game like
Evolver battlefield 4 but all around
pretty solid for a hundred bucks again I
can't stress enough what a good deal
that is for for just the additional
layer of functionality you get in your
living room alright so now that I gave
online multiplayer games a chance I
thought I would just jump into a
single-player game without any bandwidth
limitations so here I am playing
Borderlands 2 this is just a solo
campaign mission so no internet speeds
involved I'm just gonna go ahead and
play play a little bit here and then I
take my time to shoot this guy in the
head cuz he doesn't see me and I totally
didn't kill him
that's cool so now it's on okay those
guys coming here - why hello oh boy so
there was a little bit of lag right
there I don't know if you guys could see
it but there was a tiny bit of lag and I
might die right here
nevermind so I'm pretty much getting
about the same amount of delay as I was
playing balls which tells me that it's
not really bandwidth limited as far as
my internet speeds go but it's just the
decoding power the processing power of
the dokgo itself so maybe you know with
a higher-end model in the future they
can invest a little bit more on
processing power and might have a little
bit less lag as a result which would be
nice but I think that pretty much sums
up all the things that I wanted to say
and all the things I wanted to show you
about the doko streaming box from NZXT
in my opinion like I said before I think
it's a great little thing a great little
device for a hundred bucks that really
brings a lot more functionality to your
living room or whatever room you want to
put it in but what do you guys think let
me know in the comments below what you
would use it for if you think it's worth
$100 price points if you think that's
too aggressive or favorable I want to
hear about that as well other than that
leave me a like on this video if you
enjoyed it feel free to subscribe to the
channel for more tech videos coming
really soon and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
