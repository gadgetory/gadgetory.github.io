live to both like simultaneously okay
that's crazy I don't know what to I
honestly don't think it'll phase YouTube
I think it'll be loose I think it'll be
alright but this is Jean someone's on
equal footing today hi guys hi so you're
a show has now started my show has
started with the burbs and yeah thank
you for being here guys welcome back to
awesome hardware the best tech show ever
yeah weather if you want to call it a
tech show cuz if maybe you've seen other
tech shows they suck yeah they do this
one's gonna be we fully disapprove of
all of it oh you finish your beer rating
I did I didn't well you were you were up
and doing things I was just kind of
couch potato in you here but you'll
catch up Wow by the time I finish that
sentence you had caught up well he can't
can't be a slacker that's true alright
um welcome down some hardware hey guys
this is a live show that Poe and I do
every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time right here on twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware and to our
respective YouTube channels be like to
split the show up in two halves on the
youtubes today we are streaming to my
channel first and then after about an
hour so you can head over to Paul's
channel where will stream the rest of
the episode you can find a link to his
channel in my description or you guys go
to calm slash Paul's Hardware that's not
true and yeah it's gonna be a great show
we like to talk about tech and tech news
things that are trending in in the field
that we love and also occasionally have
a good nice beer or two we do and they
drink beer we curse occasionally yes if
you're the ones around also offended or
some have small children hide them yeah
I don't turn this off suffocate them go
go watch something that's occasional
watcher Barney does Barney still exist
probably not I mean it exists it's not
gone I mean he's not like there's a live
running show little Sardis in
syndication
I can use it in syndication right is it
on broadcast television I mean or
available for streaming I'm not sure I
think Barney but should have
by now the point is you should go back
to Barney he's a dinosaur he should have
been alive in this era to begin with
anyway I'm getting too into this we love
that you are here happened and we thank
you
I'm just watching chips on okay
Jif or gif because I said jiff I don't
even know anymore video and I got so
much patience for it one of this thing
it was like the internet broke from me
saying jiff
it was in the Q&amp;amp;A videos like I can't
it's one of those popular highly
contentious things to argue about that
ultimately is of zero significance like
you know pineapple on pizza or like
whether the dress was blue and yellow or
pink and green or whatever the yeah was
stupid oh yeah right like it's like one
of those things but I also feel like
this is somewhat more defined like I
don't know I feel like there's a deeper
like there's a more real the I objective
I have an objective truth here so I had
always boiled it down to it from what I
understand and I hope this isn't just
like a an urban legend that I believed
or something but I thought the the
creator shit before Matt yeah that it
was jiff that's what stuck ever since I
read that probably like a week ago I
started calling a gift so I've been
calling it gif my whole life until I
googled it just before filming that
video and was like oh it's jiff the
creator of the word of actually not of
the word of the animation of the
universe and the universe called the
jiff and I was like Google wouldn't lie
to me it never has never will trust with
my life I'm gonna start calling you Jeff
now and then everyone hates me now for
calling it that
so anyway maybe this is a disappointed
yeah I know it's even worse but crushed
there the reality you guys sound off in
chat creators from nothing you're wrong
about your own creation I'm gonna drink
this beer you're gonna drink that beer
which has a lovely name what are you
drinking alright so let's let's I mean
we've already began the show but let's
continue to begin the show begin it even
deeper veins I'm using you to the beers
for today I went I went over to BevMo
spent spent some money I got this
orgasmic orange basically because it's
called orgasmic orange so I hope it's
not terrible this is from Indian Wells
Brewing Company that's that's pretty
local here there's a casino over there
the Indian Wells because you know anyway
at six point two percent alcohol it's
it's a premium orange flavored blogger
blogger flavored with orange peels so
tasty see I've got the the old try to
drink great white I'm lost coast
brewings goes great white a lot of shoes
this Paul's hardware emblazoned logo and
bottle opener sure well it is quite
sturdy and seems like a good purchase as
headstrong oh wow jeez yeah yeah puddle
opener does not guarantee a good poor
ladies gentleman I mean I didn't feel
like that was horrible I guess I just
gave it it too too quick of a tilt well
you know it is it is orgasmic or it is
orgasmic so it does tend to yellowed a
lot more white stuff in there that's
aweso again they get a lot of head with
you orgasmic orange there you go I guess
is the point yes haha well played Indian
company you know that's a thing maybe
that's just part of the experience
yes McCrory that's by design it's like
90 percent head I mean I had that on
video so I could watch it back at some
point because I don't I don't feel like
I really gave it that strong of a of a
tilts there but yeah anyway I'm gonna
I'm gonna down drew slow it down this so
Cheers
thank you all for joining us today yay
how was the foam from what you can tell
how's the beer tasty red orange II it's
not bad alright well now he's not
knocking my socks off but well I guess
Paul doesn't love head
much as we thought he did that's okay
maybe it's the type of thing that builds
up and then towards the end see like
that was a very what the hell it's a
very careful poured on the side of the
glass and maybe something there's
something chemistry related going on
here something scientific I can explain
this phenomenon that we're seeing here
but until that exploration comes around
in the meantime let's plug our stores
because we sell stuff oh yeah like like
bottle openers and glasses and mugs and
pints pint glasses and stuff my store is
biblioth√®que slash store and there I
sell all kinds of things the mouse pads
are doing really well the hardware mugs
are doing well these desk mats are very
high quality
stitched edges rubber bottoms and you
know fabric cloth material nice
embroidery and all good stuff and things
all high quality Paul sells check on his
story you saw fitness spinners I still
have a few fish like spinners really
left there's probably like three maybe
that's five you know it's really hard to
sell things that you know but I'm glad I
only have three left I'm not like 100
that's true that's right Paul's hardware
net for my store I also have an
arrangement of various prodigies which
would eat which are very nice I like
that I want I really want a hoodie like
that on my store check out my buddy
but yeah it's really nice because it's
actually but gotten cold here in
California it has this is what we would
consider the logo cool people are making
fun of me on Twitter because I was like
it's 69 in my house lying there were
nine part but orgasmic fleece or
something like that
hmm I like somebody's face off to the
touch I've still I'm still rocking the
rise and one for now until I have my own
my Zune Zune happy reading redesigning
my own my logo soon we will see
unfortunately I'm neither of our stories
can you buy an awesome awesome sauce
awesome sauce Network yeah sure yeah
anyone who owns one of these you're the
real OG cuz and you should probably sell
this on eBay for like
you know that's where the price of a GTX
10800 of money so if you buy stuff from
either of our stores we will yell
Johnson at you at the end of our our
show which is slightly tradition
concerning but also kind of cool ritual
and you will be helping support and
great cause that being us let's move on
though to my first segment a segment
that I actually haven't done in a long
time to fund or not to fund I can fix
this Oh Paul's on it while he does I
will he warms that up who gets ready for
the lower thirds this is a segment where
we take a look at a few crowdfunding
campaigns on Kickstarter IndieGoGo that
sort of thing just to see what's out
there what are people trying to
capitalize on there we go nice a nice
job Paul um and we we talked about it
what are the what's the deal here is
there anything worth your your
hard-earned dollar to actually go out
and fund and obviously we take these
with a grain of salt because anything
that's crowd funded that isn't a real
product yet you know be careful which
everybody you're putting your money into
every crowd funded product or project
that we've recommended on this show has
done very well that's not true we have
not followed up and confirm that that's
inner it's of it's an arbitrary
statements very difficult to prove oh
yes that's why captain captain bacon
that was good I thought you were playing
devil's advocate first oh no I mean I
was I was gonna say something very
specific like you know hazard each
person 1 million dollars that's that's
probably too much everything in this
room this crowdfunding Amway or
something so this this first product is
the GPD
win - it's a handheld game console for
triploid games and hey guys it's Austin
I thought my my system was glitching out
when I first saw this I was like no he
actually did a video on this exact
product I wonder how much it costs to
get get Austin to review your bug to do
your your indeed
that's where all the two million dollars
that they raised went to like they got
all that back just so they could have
grabbed yeah so although they've
actually raised ninety three thousand
dollars at this point two million went
to Austin for this video yeah exactly so
what does this do what it's it's running
Windows 10 so it's running Windows 10
and it's designed to run Triple A games
in a handheld form factor okay so it's
like a DES on steroids right that's
fully PC forward and clearly there's an
interest here because obviously two
million two million dollars funded of
their one hundred thousand dollar goal
blue-blue well past that and it's
rocking sort of a more obscure mobile
processor here the Intel Core M three
seven Y three zero
I have never heard it before and what's
also weird is that it doesn't say it has
a discrete GPU it says it's got Intel HD
graphics six one five okay so it is at
720p to 720p screen you don't need that
helps but till the fact that they're
running games like GTA 5 and battlefield
or whatever and I mean if you're using
medium-low settings you can get a decent
amount of frames that of you know pretty
mediocre hard workers especially at
seven twenty seven twenty is a lot fewer
pixels in anything ten eighties that's
true that's true it'd be interesting to
see what kind of frame rates you would
get although I think their refresh rate
here is sixty Hertz on the screen it is
an IPS screen so that's good you have
eight gigs of memory even end up to SSD
at 128 gigabytes which is replaceable
and there's no capacity ceiling so you
can stick a one terabyte SSD in there if
you wanted to which you'll probably have
to if you're installing big triple-a
triple-a titles here 128 gigs is not
gonna get you very far
it's made of aluminium alloy the body
anyway it's got a forty nine hundred or
two forty nine hundred milli amp
batteries in series and that gives you
about six to eight hours of battery life
you know depending on your usage okay so
it looks like it's got a built in sort
of you know joystick controller looks
like a built-in Xbox controller as often
put in
video and you know you gotta compromise
somewhere with sides like this I need
better pictures I feel like it's for an
IndieGoGo up there there we go
appearance ah like halfway down the page
yeah so um looks like it's got sort of
like a you know a touch keyboard like
actual physical Keys d-pad couple
joysticks yeah and yeah I mean it you
know I feel like it could look a bit
more stylish it doesn't look like a
cutting-edge product it looks a little
dated but functionality wise I'd be
curious to see how it performs um the
other thing though is that it's six
hundred and fifty dollars okay so it's
much more expensive than say a DS which
would be probably you know at least one
of its competitors being a hand are very
popular if not the most popular handheld
gaming device currently so I mean can
you could you argue that since it runs
Windows you could do some productivity
stuff on it and I mean email he met
email and web browser might work how
productive it would be without like now
I don't have any of the Nintendo
handhelds do any of them have like basic
internet capability like like a bright
they do oh I don't know if they actually
little Wi-Fi and stuff yeah I think I
mean Wi-Fi connect to the internet yes
play games but I believe it's there for
a browser built-in can you go on on the
internet and go to websites I want to
say yes but don't quote me on that I
have no idea
I've never never been into handheld
gaming I just I yeah chat saying yes you
can
so okay pornhub is an option all right
well then that makes this that less of
it the selling point for this thing I
would think productivity is more
productive on your phone than this thing
because you I mean it's got a keyboard I
mean a keyboard but so does your phone
right yes and I feel like the
touchscreen now where I feel like I'm
more used to a touch a touch interface
than physical keys I guess whereas you
know 10 years ago it was completely
backwards especially with things like
autocorrect like does this thing have
autocorrect for Windows you know if you
know it's things like that so I'm not
sure if it's gonna be a great
productivity device but if you're
looking into some Triple A games there's
also bumper buttons
the back good old bumpers good for FPS
is and other things so so there's that
let's move on though to the next thing
wait so every family oh yeah $60 750
bucks I'm gonna say no cuz I feel like
it sounds too good to be true like gonna
be 900 bucks when it comes right yeah
that's the early burden that's why I
feel like you could buy a low-end gaming
laptop right with the 1080 screen but
you won't be able to play it in like a
waiting room yeah doctor's office I'm
just gonna do just good - yes
Upolu of them for 1300 I need to go yeah
moving on the LexA PA me mouse that has
two internal joysticks
oh say wha lots of fast-paced editing
that cut cut guy with a Super Nintendo
t-shirt telling you stuff Mouse
he looks trustworthy about this laser
censored mouse that has two joysticks
built-in the one that's more obvious is
on the side where your thumb would go
and so you can you know give up down
left right diagonal and stuff and you
it's all programmer notice sees the old
joystick jump back again I'm thinking
maybe scrolling through your items in
inventory right maybe maybe that makes
it easier than having to use the
keyboard for that or I guess you could
use one for like zooming if you wanted
like you know push forward on the
joystick to zoom in like a first-person
shooter there's a bunch of other things
that you could program it with the other
joystick that's not as obvious until you
get a closer look is actually on the
mouse that under the mouse itself the
map on its axis is sitting on a another
like it floats on a pad there that shows
it right there joystick so you got yeah
exactly so it's kind of like I would
imagine this for like flying game like
flying simulators or maybe racing games
exactly sure fascinating um so it it
looks like it's just stationary there
but you can also move it like a regular
mouse so that's how you know I have to
chive to try yeah like a hundred percent
concern here would be like accidentally
rocking it like right it's a it's an
action you're not really used to
Rekha's I guess most of the time when
you get your hand on a messy usually
it's kind of liable right so
all right well that's I mean and there's
like like if it's a game like GTA 5 I
can see that actually being semi useful
where like flying or yeah exactly like
if you're just running around the city
then tilting your mouse like this
probably won't do anything it just won't
have any any effect but as soon as you
jump into like a chopper then all of a
sudden you get you know you're tilting
yo and stuff like that
yah yah yah mahn yah yah so yeah throw
the yah
so how much how much do you think this
goes for I think we should at least
pledge 1 euro to join their gaming
community oh it's just a euro you know
the early bird price is 99 euro which is
about 123 US dollars right it's pretty
steep that is a lot tomato delivery is
in June there's clearly some interest
that's it's raised a quarter of a
million dollars out of its thirty
thousand dollar goal there are 98 left
so 900 900 people have been like yes
this is worth the money and then after
that it's gonna go up to 109 euro or
about 135 US dollars I as an early bird
on this one I would say no yeah just cuz
you know you you you you wanna you want
do you want more independent you know
review of people's response to using it
and it seems to me like it has what I
would call the steam controller effect
where it's different and innovative and
new and it's like oh if that worked
perfectly as its as it says it does it
would be amazing but the execution is a
different story and as we all know the
steam controller is pretty much unused
by everyone except for our good friend
and moderator self processing in chat
hey he likes it I love the steam
controller for playing minecraft in the
living room although I haven't done that
in a while anyway let's move on to the
next one this is the last item here the
enttec the world's first AO or all in
one sorry
portable smart 4k projector it's 4k
projector okay and you know okay
it's raised almost half a million well
$400,000 of its $25,000 goal with a
month left to go it's fairly portable I
mean it kind of looks like a giant
pancake but taller all right and it it
does output 3840 by 2160 at 60fps that's
on the DLP tech doctor as the technology
it's using and I don't know much about
projectors because I just don't deal
with them very often but this one has a
NSI lumens of 1,500 and I don't know how
bright that is
it seems low to me just off the bat but
I don't I don't know do you know how
bright 1500 ANSI lumens is I feel like I
feel like a full brightness ones around
3000 okay buddy but like you I don't
look at projectors that often so I'd
have to have to yeah gotcha and a lot of
people in chat are kind of confirming
what I already believed that 1500 is
pretty low and I had that feeling also
because they didn't really advertise it
except at the very bottom of the
incredibly long post okay so that kind
of makes sense so that's that's really
the Achilles heel here I think that's
always a problem with this little tiny
portable projector like the one they
have for the the Moto phone you know and
all those like they just you need only
you need pitch blackness you need
pitches and effectively yeah right so um
there's that you know you can whatever
it's got a speaker that's stacks on top
of it it's got bluetooth and Wi-Fi so
technically I guess you could stream
with it it's got built-in storage it's
3d capable 3 ok what's kind of cool
raised 415 million dollars and it's $500
for the earlybird
ok that's a lot like that's it's a very
niche product I think that some people
are gonna get a kick out of who really
like I don't know wanna watch movies on
their ceiling in their bedroom and yeah
right sure but I don't really see myself
using something like this ever I feel
like if I even if I owned one of these
if someone gave this to me for free I'd
probably never use
yeah I mean there's better it's like
your technology interest in a projector
projectors are pretty cool in the right
scenario but that's that's if you need
the right like location and everything
for them yeah it's gonna be that perfect
if you're like baller enough to have a
house where you're like I'm gonna have
like a home theater you know something
like that yeah yeah you want that
projector then you want like a big nice
projector exactly brightness and like
yeah that kind of thing right portable
projector is just I've never I don't
know yeah I've never I've never the most
the most of the time when I see ads for
portable projectors they're aimed at
like business professionals who like go
on the road and do presentations and
usually then you need it to like throw
up you know make PowerPoint a short
video and or a PowerPoint or something
like that so yeah I don't know this kind
of falls in the same sort of category as
the GPD that we looked at just a moment
ago that was you know a mini PC of
handheld or it's like it's trying to
take something but like really high in
technology or that's something that's
usually very large and cram it down to a
portable size for convenience but you
sacrifice a lot of performance that way
and so there are certain components that
I feel certain devices like projectors
or like desktop towers that that just
aren't ready yet to be condensed down to
a small size just because the
technology's not quite there yet they're
not ready we're not ready for portable
4k projectors as my opinion so no I
would not fund this the one thing that I
would fund on this list is probably
nothing
I'd probably fund okay if I had to pick
I'd fund the GPD just because Austin was
on it because Austin endorsed it no he
didn't endorse it because Austin's face
was on it and I like Austin and and you
are just struggling with these orgasmic
orange pores I swear to God like you
it's even foaming up on this move in the
bottle people were watching me right
that was I actually haven't seen you
pour I was like dude dude
getting trolled by your beer sorry sorry
it'll ill it'll go down eventually it's
orgasmic so you know it's worth it
excuse me there you go it feels good all
right so that's the funder not to fund
ladies and gentlemen hooray yay let's
move on to the next segment which is pin
my PC you guys submitted some pictures
of your rigs and Paul and I are gonna
help you out and tell you how cocky they
are yes all right starting with Jericho
sure cool he's got a horizon five 1600 X
with an as Rock Pro for a B 350 and
motherboard 16 gigs of vengeance LED
thirty-two hundred megahertz RAM GTX 970
windforce 3x that's a gigabyte card high
for 212 Evo define mini see from fractal
design and storage and stuff so you know
this is actually a really clean system
to be honest um you know I think I think
the thing that stands out to me is just
the the hyper 212 while it's a very good
price to performance cooler does tend to
look aesthetically on the budget side of
things and yeah I feel like the rest of
your case isn't super budget like it's
pretty nice a 970 still still definitely
have some oomph to it and the the the
fractal case that you've had written
that you have together defined C is a
gorgeous case and so I feel like these
premium parts that you have in here
especially the wind for school I love
that wind force cooler I like this
picture a lot I feel like yeah you get a
good camera there just to accent colors
I don't know everything everything is
working for me here definitely like the
little pop of blue even though the blue
and is is not matching with the the red
LEDs like it still work it's still
working for me yeah it's like a dream
it's like a technology technology-based
red white and blue theme yeah that's pay
patriotism murica America I like the
fact that you swapped out the cooler
master fan for a fractal one and
especially to make them all unified in
throughout your case I think that's
great
yep I just think the heatsink and the
copper pipes are showing on the
faceplate of
cooller are a little uggs but it's just
this is aesthetic thing a little great
cooler especially for the you know you
don't really need a robust cooler for a
1600 X even if you're overclocking
really so yeah and you've already got
the cable thing down I mean it looks
good
that's it I would just maybe upgrade the
cooler like a something work pretty quad
quad Lumi maybe h7 from cryo rig or one
of the ETS t40 from enter max those are
good values or you know just go balls to
the wall balls to the wall with a custom
water cooling loop you never just sell
everything and replace it all with a
single gtx 1060 you textin six that's
about what you get for your money right
now all right thanks doc thank you
Jericho next us with swifty yeah got a
FX 8350 so uh last gen AMD based system
here at gigs of ram an RX 474 gig and
the GT 431 gig is that perhaps your
physics card sir streaming so this is
two systems this is a dual system built
so the streaming part is FX 6300 with
four gigs of ram and an HD 6451 gig a
hauppage colossus to capture card of
course our 540 air is the case FX 6300
hits 54 C under full load even with
limited airflow built from parts he
already owned alright
another cool hyper 212 looks like is it
it's definitely cooler master yeah so
last time but secondary system crammed
here in the back of of your ear air 540
which is a use decent use of that space
there's often lots of extra space in the
back of an air 540 because it's one of
the box style cases so extra power
supply and then this is where the mini
80
system is which apparently is used for
streaming so that would have been my
question would be how hot does all this
get what both of them are running at the
same time
apparently he's saying everything's
staying pretty cool too so props to you
for wedging that all in there how did he
fit the second system back there like
there's no mounting points right it's
not a dual system chassis no he this is
hacked in there so he hacked out the
back to put the second power supply in
he ran some extensions here for the
Ethernet jack and the HDMI out for for
that system and he's also got looks like
a secondary HDMI here as well as a
couple USBs and audio so that's all the
basic connections you need Wow for a
system and there you have it two systems
in a single system that's pretty cool
Gaming is just streaming that's pretty
sweet damn alright yeah I mean I I
applaud you on the resourcefulness you
know this is definitely not cutting-edge
hardware but the fact that it's all
fitting in there and I mean you're most
powerful and part of it the 8350 which
especially if you're overclocking it can
output a decent amount of heat I forget
what the TDP on a 350 is I feel like
it's like no one it's well then there's
a ninety five ninety that also confused
to you because that one has a higher
deep deep anyway it can output a lot of
heat so that and the RX 470 as well
that's a definitely not at the 400
series is 120 595 Watts TDP come on 25
right that's not terrible yeah that
works for 70 you know this is decent and
he out but I should say I'm sorry
so anyway well done and I'm not sure
what to tell you as far as aesthetic
upgrades here because honestly
everything is looking pretty good
oh there's a supplemental fan this is an
antique fan yeah a little USB guy right
now for some X years over the VRMs there
- I like that so yeah I like those
little fans very nice and I still
makeshift power supply basement but
although that's a hard drive basement oh
yeah yeah right
it's the air 540 yeah that's pretty cool
- honestly I have no I have never
commended for you know yeah I mean after
seeing what you've done here and
really tasty not just for anything you
are you are very crafty sir well that's
a thank you swifty thanks man
so we have James James Bowen the Corsair
460 X RGB white core i5 7600 K + AZ 270
pro 4 motherboard from asrock of course
our H 100 IV - 16 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance ddr4 2400 and the GTX 10
seven-day okay alright we got a white
build going on here and I love like the
component choices I think everything
like as far as the components go they
seem to work well together and cable
management is the other thing that was
the first thing I noticed is a little
for the fans the front fans
it looks like the cables are kind of
hanging out a little bit but what case
is this that's the the 460 X 4 60s yeah
Corsair 460 X RGB white alright which
you don't see too often I haven't seen
the white version much so submissions
I feel like kale management's for some
of your fans up here is a little loose
and then you have just a bit of extra
hanging out from from your PCI Express
graphics cable here and then your so
you've got the small motherboard in a
large case syndrome going on although
it's micro ATX on a full sized ATX it's
not like a huge difference like mini ITX
or something but it's still you got a
lot of white space down here and then
the fact that you got the you have to
stream the cables across that yeah makes
them stand out even more especially
since this black on white so that's
what's standing out to me a little bit
here if you really attack the cable
management and you want to make it super
super good-looking even pay attention to
little stuff like this like the cables
that are going behind gaps in the
motherboard tray like those those can
stand out again especially if it's black
and white
yeah like you've got going on here so I
just feel like like a micro ATX case
would would do you well unless you're
planning on upgrading and expanding in
the future I just I don't know that's
that's what I would say because I
because micro ATX I really
that form factor I think it's a nice
balance between size and expandability
but when you put it in a full-size ATX
case it's like why didn't you just get
an 8 full sized ATX motherboard yeah and
then you'd fill out that space and you'd
have a little bit more expansion slots
than everything right
oh that's said overall it's you know
your color schemes definitely on points
and you have a nice last Cal set a nice
selection of components for sure so
mm-hmm
yeah yep I agree with everything Paul
said cool thanks James thank you James
next up we have de'vide or David David
freshly ducted Cory 537 15 degrees 70 K
or that would mean die fast 70 K maybe
he's dyslexic I think you meant 35 70 K
what core i5 35 70 K is what I assume he
doesn't have a motherboard listed so
it's hard to see which platform this is
looks like an AZ rock extreme board
maybe I want to say 3770k 3770k that's
gonna be I mean just mr7 but then that's
weird though because I'd be an i7 it
looks like you're trying to write AI 530
maybe he just missed them 35 70 canes
yeah 35 70 K right that's what I think
okay that's W I guess with the gtx 1070
and a bit phoenix samurai case so the
case looks fairly budget kind of just
tell from the cutouts for the cables and
the drive cage v a quarter inch bays so
it's more or less a budget system but
you know the core i5 35 70 K is still a
pretty good chip you know it still has
some pretty decent single thread
performance for considering how old it
is and you know you've got a decent GPU
to pair it with
I think the 970 still has some
some power to it it looks like your rear
fan is is set to intake actually which
is kind of competing with your CPU
cooler and it's also probably going to
generate more dust in your case because
it doesn't look like you have a dust
filter on the other side of that ban
maybe he reversed is airflow what if the
CPU cooler fan is also pulling but you
can see the arrows on the CPU cooler
Finn you're right you can pointing
excellent detective work Kyle hahaha
we've done it again Sherlock okay so I
would flip that fan unless there's some
really weird specific reason that you
have it flip that way cable management
looks a little hairy down there Oh
beneath your graphics card and your
drives so especially those blue SATA
cables dude I would make a black a trip
yeah definitely clashing SATA cables are
like a dime a dozen like probably
literally at this point so I would I
would say you know grabbing some black
ones or even some red ones that would go
with the kind of black and red theme of
your graphics card Kyle what's your
opinion on keeping the the caps on the
SLI bridges here I was just buying those
you think what do you think and they're
somewhat stylish from MSI cuz you know
they're they're great read/write it
protects those gold contact points right
there's something about it though that
bothers me
like just inside I get just like I just
want to like pick them off you know what
I mean I think maybe it's just because
it's this it's just there for packaging
and I know it's there for packaging
mainly it's not there to be shown off so
I think just like I always take them off
no matter what they look they usually
take them off yeah but you know to each
their own
alright so some some attack the cable
management down here and get rid of your
blue static cables consider some cable
extensions although overall probably not
worth the investment on the system you
probably want to save that for
investment in a new platform so yeah
you're gonna probably enough to live
with the ketchup and mustard if you
really do want to go through and
and redo things consider removing your
power supply yeah sticker as well and if
you read your platform later down the
line I would also upgrade the case at
the same time yeah it'll give you a case
is a bit more airflows this is like it
this is like it gets the job done case
and and whenever you do decide on a new
system you'll appreciates a lot of the
advances that have been made in case
technology yes over the past five ten
years looks like you're missing a couple
expansion slots to help management
covers yeah but thanks David thanks
David next up we've got there's our last
one tape and caveman the i7 6700 builds
with a GTX 1070 eight gigs of a data xpg
RAM and Asus eight 170 pro motherboard
120 gig is a data SSD one terabyte WD
hard drive and asking for judgment we
found first judgements tell us tell us
your case because it was helpful to now
use the NZXT phantom or or switch maybe
yeah it's the one that has like lookit
you can kind of tell it's got go splat
and then it kind of curves in it's an
older case okay hold on zxt case no
rubber grommets or anything like that
but the first thing I noticed is that
Intel's the stock Intel cooler
definitely right on NZXT yeah stock
intel heat sink fan yeah that's a big
no-no on a 6700 I would I would get
something a little better yeah I mean
it's gonna be functional and you're
definitely you'd like your don't have an
overclockable chips so don't don't go
drop in you know a hundred bucks on a
liquid cool or anything like that that's
silly but you can definitely get
yourself some very quiet like like
almost makes no noise performance with
you know a thirty to forty dollar
aftermarket cooler that will also look a
lot better
we got the the clear led fan and we've I
want to make this more of a tradition I
feel like I'm on pimp my PC that we
equate the clear LED fan with like clear
heels like like ladies will well
seek other ladies for wearing the clear
heels not classy at all
no like that's what hookers were right
that's what we're talking about here
with the clear led fan just yeah you're
a you're a you're a geek hooker pretty
much your total that's what we're saying
nerd hooker not sure about the power
supply as well that also wasn't oh wait
it's it's down here this is a high power
power supply so yeah I would I would I
would replace that power supply yeah
this that yeah it's just it doesn't look
it doesn't it does have an eighty plus
rating on the side but I've never heard
of the brand high power before maybe he
got it from like a prebuilt or something
yeah it looks like a power a power
supply that you would find out of like a
cyber or all-in-one yeah so so consider
a power supply upgrade your case isn't
bad you know like like we said you you
have cable routing options but you're
not really using them as effectively as
you could you could just pull a lot of
more of the slack back behind the
motherboard I think from some of the
cables for your PCI Express and your
optical drive and and and that kind of
thing and then housing that's one stick
of RAM of this a single gram stick - oh
gosh
get that get on that dual channel
bandwagon for a little channel is a
thing you're not gonna make a huge deal
for your I think in your case but yeah I
mean it also balances things out I feel
like yeah just you know paradigm it's
good practice and it's it's performance
you're leaving on the table even if it's
not a huge difference and and just last
thing to point out but more more SLI
covers more read SLI covers no no I
jumped about I just jumped back know
even like look at the new one like look
no on this one - he's got him all that
I've gotta reopen it two in a row dude I
think I'm sensing like I don't know
there's a conspiracy going on with red
SLI finger covers I don't know right
there people love them I I don't get it
let's look like those don't even look
like they came with it well I guess it's
an IMSI yeah you know oh that's a msi
gtx 1070 so I guess they're red no
matter even if even if there's no red
accent 170 for like $3,000 yeah and then
just buy buy at 1064 $1000 and then
spend an extra 2,000 on it I'm creating
the rest of your system and that's all I
think that's like it alright thank you
everyone who submitted a guys if you
didn't happen to get picked this week
there will be other opportunities in the
near future but looking forward to it
let us move on to let's do some tech
news all right let's do some tech news
here we've got a few stories here I'm
one two three four yeah but like three
or four stories here for tech news we
got a lot more stuff on Paul's half but
for starters here we've got an article
from videocards dot-com about some new
coffee like CPUs that are ready locked
and loaded and ready for shipping these
are gonna be launching over the next
couple months very soon and we've got
the core i5 8600 non K so probably be a
little bit cheaper it's actually quoted
here 2200 No
yeah $220 us and then we have the i-5
8500 at $200 we have an i3 at the i3
8300 for $135 so definitely drops down
quite a bit not sure if that's a quad
core or dual core want to say dual core
but not sure and at least five Pentiums
and Celer ons there will also be cheaper
motherboards why are you smiling
Oh cuz because here is he where is he he
dragged up he dragged the bed over so he
oh right there
why he dragged it over yeah and he's he
does that doing stuff down there he
doesn't know he's like licking himself
and it just sounds very good - it is but
yeah he asked I can't I need to catch
him moving the bed like he's very
stealthy it's like suddenly like wait
what for being like the biggest dog ever
like he's super ninja
just somehow makes the better a mix of
terrifying anyway and then Sochi from
other boards will be launching alongside
this new wave of coffee like chips so
we're gonna see you know the H 170 or
I'm sorry H 370 and B 360 chipsets which
obviously just makes things even more
confusing than they already are H 370
yep and B 360 and it's like and you
you've got the B the B 350 on on the AMD
side so it's just there's no there's no
healthiness ah
I said I ain't like ex 370 and z3 78
yeah every time I hear one or the other
I have to kind of think like but yeah
that's right aimed okay it's just look
the X and the Z are just two of those
examples that just kind of are
interchangeable or synonymous so it's
just really annoying yeah yeah yeah like
you had 26 letters in the alphabet and
you had literally any three-digit number
and that's though when you picked
I don't know uh hashtag marketing I
don't understand it so I hit it some new
chips therefore all you copy like lovers
it seems as easy 390 motherboards and
the eight core CPU we've been hearing
about are gonna be launching at a later
time it was speculated at one point that
would be launching alongside everything
we just mentioned but rumors are saying
suggesting summer summer release XIII 98
to be 90 mother why is that needed that
I don't know what how does that do I
don't know maybe it's an eight core
coffee like CPU that Intel's just like I
don't know that they I need a new
chipset for right like white why do they
need like what's the new chips that
gonna bring unless the a core CP is not
coffee like and it's what's the next one
latte like
cappuccino cappuccino like I don't know
I had I honestly haven't read any of the
rumors on Z 390 or this eight core CPU I
was just mentioned in the article they
didn't really go to detail about it sure
it's just a video
curds calm just just fucking with us
like yeah yeah let's go make a bunch of
numbers for the new stuff people we all
confused let's send this over to WCC if
to God posted better are you
so that's apparently gonna compete with
the news at the Zen + rising to family
which launches later in April which I
think we have more confidence that that
is actually happening than than Z 390
and and this eight core CPU this mystery
CP were like Mike what my question is
gonna be when they launched these new
platforms like Duke are people like is
our GPU prices and memory prices
affecting investments in the CPUs and
the motherboards right because you have
different companies making different
products but it's all part of the same
they're all part of the same ecosystem
over there right so I'm gonna buy I feel
like at some point you know depending on
whether we actually get graphics cards
back in stock and available for sale
like it's gonna start affecting sales of
other components the other system
components the only yeah it's really
weird
unless yeah I mean it yeah we'd have to
I'm gonna be really curious to see what
I don't know I don't know though would
it
cuz you know the same sort of thing that
you were saying like when I was like why
would they even sell like $900 GPUs and
you were like well they're clearly
selling for that price if they're
putting with that price so would we see
would we really see a drop-off in like
new PC builds if whether or not they're
for gaming like they might just be for
mining you know anything for something
like a like a rapid price increase like
that you can you can just kind of
logically verify that yes they must be
selling because prices don't go up like
that unless yes something for something
that's selling at MSRP if it's selling
it or not that's harder to determine and
it's up to the company to decide whether
how they want to deal with that
sometimes they might deal with it like
all right there's a lull in sales right
now but we don't want to devalue our
product so we're not going to change
your pricing we're just going to kind of
wait this out sometimes they might be
like are
we need to drop prices because demand
isn't where it should be in right so and
you know what now that I think about it
you're not gonna need an eight-core high
end until CPU to mine anyway yeah people
wouldn't be buying the CPU for gaming or
for mining which yeah maybe you're right
we're just gonna see a big you know a
dipping it's almost something that I'd
like not hoping for but just like if
there's anything that can be done to
push GPU manufacturers or whoever else
can have an impact on graphics card
prices to do something like yeah then
hopefully it happens I guess we are
gonna be talking about
Intel perhaps making plans for a GPU of
their own on Paul's house yes probably
it's probably the gaming room right away
but still exciting news let's move on to
our next article from the verge I didn't
realize this was a couple days old came
out from beer 14th but less than a week
ago so still semi relevant sorry this is
about the home pop the Apple home pod
which has been destroying wooden desks
and tables everywhere with this nasty
white ring of death but knowing it
as I'll burn your house down right it's
all it's all ruined something like that
several outlets proclaiming that it
leaves a white ring on wooden surfaces
Apple confirmed the issue with them
stating the marks Canon like like
there's a lot of Apple quotes in this
art and this little article here that
every time I read what I'm just like
really it looks like my initial response
so first they said the marks can improve
over several days after the speaker is
removed from the wood surface okay so it
apparently this is just a
self-correcting issue that you know I
don't know Apple has some invisible
helpers that will clean up the stain
it'll just dissolve apparently over time
and then the Apple also suggests that
users try cleaning the surface with the
manufacturer's suggested oiling meth
method if the Rings persists so Apple
solution is oh our product damages your
table well you should clean it then okay
it's reasonable sure putting it on a
cloth some people are like why don't you
just put it on the little cloth
ya know on your table that doesn't work
as well because the way it's designed it
has the tweeters actually firing
downward so it sort of uses a hard
surface to reflect the sound and to
create a bigger you know a bigger
spatial spatial noise in your room and
having a cloth or you know carpeted
surface underneath it of any kind would
definitely hamper the very impressive
sound from this device so that's not
really a solution I was thinking like
like chopsticks or something like take
two chopsticks you know just two rails
and just like put it on the chopsticks
but that's probably stupid um it's
probably better to just you know ruin
your table Apple updated its support
page for the home pod saying it is not
unusual for any speaker I like how they
say such a star speaker it's unusual
that I knew without vibration dampening
silicone base to leave my old marks when
placed on some wooden surfaces that's
that's the end of the quote so so that's
that's what they're saying it's not
unusual the third agreement so okay the
marks apparently are caused by oils
diffusing between the silicone base and
the table service
surface table surface I don't know what
that is they at the very end of the day
they said they recommend placing your
home pod on a different surface if
nothing else works if you clean it you
try cleaning it doesn't work or the
stains persist just put on a different
surface so they should have like a
supported list official supported list
on the home pod box of tables the
surfaces you can put it on if that's
their official statement does not
support wood home pod they just need not
only does it not support Spotify fully
it also doesn't support you to ship it
with like a home pod condom yeah I could
rubber thing just like stretch it over
halfway roll it up around the outside
keeps it contained
he usually has a minimal impact on you
know the sound ribbed for her pleasure
yeah I think that would I think that's
the solution they're missing
I think protection is what we excuse me
so good job keep it up next up we're
talking about speaking of which we're
talking about Spotify next and how
certain job listings that they posted
recently semi suggest or definitely
suggest really that they have some plans
to launch one or more connected hardware
products Spotify is currently the global
leading global music streaming service
very impressive
they're huge but that's all they've been
up until now they're only the world's
only most popular global screaming
series very small feet um you know you
know what they say about feet so this is
a whole new venture that they're tapping
into here they're gonna try competing
with the Apple home pod which I think
they should because the home pod seems
very is very resistant to working with
Spotify and it very much favors the
Apple music streaming service very much
a locked-in ecosystem so maybe this is
sort of a response or will inevitably be
a response to that product it's also
gonna compete with the Amazon echo and
the Google home that sort of thing but
we don't know exactly what it is yet all
we know is that they're working on some
kind of hardware product we don't know
if it's gonna be a speaker or a
SmartWatch headphones it could be
anything
we don't know um what if it's like a
like a rocket
oh the what if they're gonna compete
with SpaceX the Spotify heavy the
Spotify yeah my theory so um you know
who knows what they're making here but
you know the job listings they have
include things like operations manager
for hardware product project manager for
hardware production and engineering and
rocket scientists and they say you know
in in the actual rocket cycle in the
actual description of the job listings
that says Spotify is on its way to
creating its first physical product and
setting up an operational organization
for manufacturing supply chain sales and
marketing it's also very strong hints
that they're ready and gearing up for
fulfillment and distribution so there's
gonna be a Spotify product soon and
delivering payloads to low-earth orbit
no they're not making rockets but that
would be really funny if Mark get more
companies to the space drink you're not
to be right everyone would think that
you're like an undercover spy or
something Paul knew before everyone
Russian it's a crowded market they're
getting into to be honest I don't think
we really need another smart enabled
speaker for our home that's
voice-activated or whatever so Spotify
is really gonna have to have an
attractive price point it's gonna have
to be a great product and it will surely
have to incorporate some very Spotify
specific features in order to really
sell I don't like I don't like the
consolidation like the vertical that
like the software and the hardware
vertical because it's it's - I like I
like software services that will
function on a variety of different
hardware devices to give you options
there so I I agree I'm less enthused
about this because yeah it seems my car
per device that works for Spotify
exactly and and if you're not using if
it can do things other than Spotify it
will probably always be kind of like
nudging you towards okay you would do
you wanna listen to music guns but
exactly yeah today they're still trying
to their push for their own team so
it'll be interesting to see what they
come up with I personally use Spotify
all the time it's the only streaming
music streaming service that I use so
you're already compromised basically
well not really because I have a Google
home that I love that also integrates so
well with Spotify and an even like
Google assistant done your your pixel
and stuff works flawlessly Spotify so I
really like you
like I don't really see a need to to go
that you know to pick up something like
this instantly again it's gonna have to
have some really juicy features specific
to Spotify in order to get my interest
so more on that later I'm sure we'll
we'll talk about it when it actually
comes out but for now let's talk about
our final article for tonight XXY from
my half about the expo Xbox one X and 1s
oh and this receiving 1440p support very
soon what display articles from hexes
think sexist Microsoft confirm recently
that native support for 1440p displays
was coming was imminent the Xbox one x
targets 4k displays right that's that's
their 4k console using an amusing super
sampling tech deliver some really smooth
visuals visual upgrades on 1080p
displays however a 1440p display is it
is really better is this better 1080 is
better than 1080 smaller pixels rather
than being Goldilocks - according to the
article suffers from sub optimal 1080p
imagery what does that being only locks
to mean I think it means that it's it's
not it's - it's not it's too high it's
stop - is front it's not too cold it's
just right right for a house but it's a
monitor what I mean is in terms of the
resolution maybe because it makes sense
in the context of what the writer was
trying to do I'm just right now I have
been failing to grasp this yeah I don't
know he kind of threw me after the
Goldilocks thing - Goldilocks is uh I
think an important story though I think
need to learn mmm I think that's really
what the what this is getting at this is
a show about learning is it everyone you
know it's all about moderation you know
you shouldn't be too extreme on one side
or the other which is why 1440p is like
masterrace really we should all come
together as people and and and I'll be
nice to each other and I think that's
really what this what this article is
getting and something inspirational it's
really a message to to all the people of
the world
and especially thank you especially Xbox
one owners yes
Xbox one okay just great let's bring
this back in particular are the most
effective diet beckon as much as we'd
like to think that's you know Microsoft
is changing the world with their xbox
resolution support um Xbox owners should
be should rejoice over this apparently
like the upscaling is you know the
upscaling from 1080p to 4k is is what
it's intended for for the Xbox one x the
Xbox go next
so I guess upscaling from 1080p to 1440p
what they're saying here is is not quite
as graceful I mean it just it kind of
just looks more of an in-between I mean
exactly
yeah um 1082 for kh2 see make every pics
every single pixel becomes four pixels
and that's the same thing Rick it's very
simple scale need the Xbox 1s however is
a little too weak to really game in
1440p so that probably has something
more to do with the user interface you
know having more real estate when you're
just browsing around doing video
playback video playback might look a
little crispier and other low intensity
tasks could benefit from the higher
resolution but I think really if your
time I'm gaming here you're gonna have
to be on the Xbox one X to really um
take advantage of that some folks also
in the article were complaining about
pub G players on Xbox using an adapter
for keyboard and mouse and they were
they were complaining that they were too
good like they were Opie like I keep
getting head shot it like from like a
miles away from this dude or all these
people who are using keyboard and mice
and I'm I'm on a stupid game pad and a
rep from Xbox tweeted out that the game
developer is like blue hole who develops
pub G they have the capability to to
either block keyboard and mouse users or
at least separate keyboard and mouse
users from gamepad users in different
servers so that there's no conflict of
you know that's deal level it was
decided weird like back in 2009 or
something like that like it wasn't that
it wasn't that argument was decided just
the the like controller versus keyboard
and mouse and just the the vast chasm of
disparity between
oh yeah right I mean everyone who I
forget you should know that you're gonna
lose Emily I would need to look it up
but there's a there was an early co-op
online co-op game that they did where
they allowed PC gamers to play against
console gamers and like basically all
the console gamers just quit long
because because it was such a ridiculous
slaughter yeah but speaking of pub G and
we're not talking about this on my half
but gamers Nexus just did an xbox pub G
video where they tested the framerate of
it they're doing some crazy software
framerate testing thing nice for
consoles and interests and it sucks
between 10 to 10 to 20 frames per second
at times depending on what was going on
there's all sorts of weird
inconsistencies with it of like textures
showing up and disappearing at different
times and like rubber-banding like crazy
as he went and did different things
Wow yeah I was it was actually a pretty
funny video to watch just because there
was so much nonsense and horribleness to
the Xbox port for it so right it's kind
of fun it is interesting so that's so
that's that and that concludes my half
of the most parts we can go ahead and
venture into Q&amp;amp;A or no yeah yeah if
anyone donated we're gonna quickly
answer your question yes if your
question is complicated though and let's
read it the most read enforces please
ask us very simple easy to answer
questions just so we can get through
this part because it tends to get long
at times it does thank you and we're
gonna try to answer quick okay pup
Shepherd $10 according to my tracking
number Kyle got my gift from uber Prince
about two weeks ago also I got my first
patron subscriber today and passed 700
subscribers I hope you are well
BTC on the rise yes pop I believe I did
get something from you uber Prince that
sounds like a t-shirt thing I checked my
mailbox today for it I didn't actually
bring the mail here to Paul's house but
one of them did seem to be a t-shirt and
I think it was from you so I got it
hopefully we can open that next week
cool but thank you very much
Philip see five GBP bought a KF a to
1080 Hall of Fame for the low price of
only 150 GBP on on one twist is the
switch on the back was snapped off
thoughts on this card the switch was you
what switch maybe like a bios which the
hall-of-fame cards from Galax some of
them on the very back of the card have
like a button switch the pages at turbo
mode right which if it was broken off I
wouldn't care about that because yeah
you know I overclocked it yourself and
do whatever if that's what you're
talking about if you're talking about
something on the back of the card like
back of the PCB or something that
snapped off return it didn't know that
would make sense why it was so
inexpensive for you anyway yeah but yeah
that seems like your great deal the Hall
of Fame cards are good it's very nicely
going Scott dill they got a deal with 66
cents how about them GPU prices they
suck Kyle if you got a truck like Paul
your beard would grow full it's true I
really wish that were the case I've been
trying to grow this thing out for years
didn't happen I like my truck I hate the
MB 67 thirteen dollars and 37 cents
cheers cheers to you and B thank you
thank you for sending the beautiful
photos I don't always reply to them but
I do see them mm-hmm
beautiful photos yeah and he's he tweets
pictures they're issues of the ocean oh
that's pretty
don't get those maybe I do but I haven't
checked you're just a dick I'm super
jealous
Katie's keys who Jesus Jesus is like a
whole Asus Asus spending $10 zb7 z97
with an i7 or just upgrade my FX 8120
getting porked an ATP performance I
would go with a resin platform right now
average 87 or z97 definitely because
it's probably gonna be difficult to find
motherboards that are reasonably priced
and that you know are functional and
yeah you just you have more there a lot
more new z97 barely had like MDOT -
maybe an nvme support on z97 but I'm not
sure it probably depends on the board
but yeah yeah just can't consider
horizon upgrade there's plenty of
options there you'll have a way better
upgrade path to grant and if you can
wait till April this right exactly so
Koretz Studios $10 shutout from Monroe
mi Mississippi Mississippi I greatly

to me you guys Rock
twitter is kmac 202 for a fellow Kyle
Kyle I did not see your tweets today we
kind of scrambled at the end there I hit
my PC was the last thing that I curated
for the show so I missed a ton of
submissions I mean there's like
literally hundreds by the time I
actually go through them so and I pick
like five or six for the show so there's
a really good chance that I just missed
yours but um
keep sending them in don't lose hope
because I switch it up every every week
l.joe low Joe low five dollars I just
want to say that you guys are great
thanks for the show also what do you
guys think to the MSI gaming radio and
rx 488 gigabyte GPU for 1440p yeah yeah
that's not bad I mean it's not it's not
excellent but it's not bad especially
with the a kick model that's fine yeah
and you're not gonna be able to play
everything at high settings but you're
fine thank you for your donation sir yes
John edged it with the $10 donation
happy Chinese New Year Tet Tet I don't
know what Ted is I do know Chinese New
Year it's the year of the dog happy ma I
made a fan art game of you guys on each
dot IO I would be cool if you guys can
check it out sometime keep up the
awesome work hmm okay send to us next
week you know donation or something like
that donation no I know what I mean like
the link to it I mean I'm not familiar
with each dot I am yeah
how to find it if even if I went on
there but that's linked us somehow
that's really cool
oh he says PS search face-off to find it
he did to follow up the nation I hope
that in the first message cool alright
cool thanks man Jay Miller with a $10
donation finally catching a live show up
in a while just sold my PC accepted mesh
if IC and storage can't beat selling a
used $800 1070 wow that is the flip side
of the GPU price debacle situation right
now is anyone who is in a situation to
get rid of one can make a nice pin for
800 bucks for 1070 like it was in decent
condition like I'm so I'm sure some
minor was like I got a hell of a
especially if you bought it
cuz ramen that 10 70s launched and they
were supposed to be three hundred and
eighty bucks and then they came out and
they were all four hundred and fifty
bucks and everyone was like this stupid
video $450 for ten seventy Oh what I
would do oh my god but yeah nice nice
lip there Thank You Jay for your
donation thanks man
automatic Matt $5 hey guys currently
studying CCNA for my exam in three weeks
can't stay to watch but I missed this
show a lot and and beer I miss beer
cheer you miss you Matt we miss you
thanks for your drink care for you mm-hm
Claire mysterium five dollars getting
into fine our six have a 1600 X and rx
580 wondering if I put a CLC 240
millimeter up top versus air cooler on
the CPU what helps to keep the GPU temps
lower probably a little bit typically
maybe a couple degrees but more effect
because it's more effective moving just
getting heat up up and away from from it
yes not really in your case that being
said you're not gonna run into like
overheating issues are throttling even
if you have an air cooler in there as
long as your GPU is still staying well
under t.j.maxx
so don't let that influence your don't
let that be be the main decision-making
factor is what I would say and a 1600 X
doesn't put out a ton of heat anyway
great point John Kelly $5 donation any
suggestions for a 4k media server CPU
must be HEV C 10 compare
I'll keep up to the quality wifey based
content it's always refreshing and
Eden's yes keep alluding my wife porque
media server seep you need anything the
HEV cm are a three or a like a risin
three chip honestly for a 4k streaming
server right you don't need anything
yeah we have it but also to Penn John on
an EP Ewing if you're talking about
media server if you're talking about
just for the content on this um like the
single home theater that you're setting
up for that server to be part of and
deliver content to or do you have a
family with four four kids who are all
going to be streaming independently to
their devices or otherwise that's a big
impact on that and I know there's online
information that has more more follow-up
on that but that's what I would look up
just as like how many 1080 streams in
that CPU support right that's that's
kind of the searches I'd be looking for
when it comes to people who do more
better at discussion a good video for it
hang the rising EP use I probably would
but anyways there's there's if you do
that search you'll find people who have
who can give you better advice than we
can off the top of our heads but if
you're just looking for something basic
then yeah the kind of the lowest end of
the current current platform is what we
go for whether it's a rise in three or
low in pentium or I three yeah yeah okay
sandy a goal and five dollars would love
to see you to come out to our three-day
lana thon in San Diego March 30th
through April first
San Diego LAN net is our site you're
welcome to film thank you for the invite
I've been to a LAN in a while those are
fun um look at San Diego yeah I think I
might be busy cuz April 1st is Easter
and I think I'm doing a family thing for
Easter we just weird Easter is on April
1st this year so I might not be able to
make that but I'll look into it incase
Easter doesn't happen or something
Irvine FTW Irvine for the win $20 Wow
thank you thank you very much I want to
thank both you I've never I've never I
never would have gotten into PC gaming
let alone building my own PC well you
are certainly you're very welcome
welcome and thank you for your donation
yeah
you're glad we could help Shawn Nelson
Nelson with $10 Australian I am a
content creator in Adobe should I follow
Paul's entry-level thread Ripper build
and get a 1900 X and upgrade to a second
gen thread Ripper in the second half of
2018 or should I wait for second gen
rising in q2 of 2018 I love you guys
ah gosh it depends man if you're not a
heavy Photoshop then like Verizon like
second generation Oh
second generation regular burger okay
okay I need high-end desktop if you're
doing Photoshop if you're doing video
editing yeah then yes yes and go
high-end us you're not mentioning
content creator in Adobe could be photos
premiere or could Amir are you doing
lots of video work and lots of video
transcoding and if you want to take all
of your video for example and transcode
it over to like a lossless codec that
you can render and and scrub through the
timeline and have immediate s-- anyway
if you're doing lots of video
transcoding then definitely go through a
dripper if you're just doing photo shops
and you you're okay with your with your
and four months from rising mainstream
resin yep thank you very much though Jay
Bell $5 when do you think that
motherboards will ship working with the
new rising EP use there are already
motherboards that are available in the
stores as well as online sometimes
online can be difficult but you just
have to look and if they label it Rison
Raven Ridge ready basically it'll say
something like that
motherboard boxes they'll put a sticker
on if you're looking at in store and
it'll say that right or and we're going
to talk about this on my side AMD
actually has a program in place where
they will ship you a worse low-end
temporary APU that you can really plug
in to update your BIOS and make your
motherboard ready for Raven Ridge free I
wish I wish we had that kind of support
for for a review like I feel like the
board that they sent me didn't wasn't
fully compatible or supported the APU I
don't know I was having issues yeah
they're definitely so there's definitely
been some stability issues and stuff
like that that various people have
experienced gamers Nexus did a whole
video on it recently
how to work around that bitch sucks that
was like 16 hours of troubleshooting for
them yeah I got up to about 8 hours and
I threw in the talents like I'll revisit
this later so good to be here that at
least you know average consumers are
getting that sticker validated sticker
yeah and things will get easier and
smoother as BIOS updates and and that
sort of thing come out yep Phillips e5
GBP GGG good good good the 1080 Hall of
Fame guy it's the boost button on the
back I'll be pairing it with a 1600 X at
3.8 gigahertz on the 2560 by 1080 at 75
Hertz worth upgrading to 34 40 by 1440
at 75 Hertz I would say that's worth a
worthwhile upgrade a GTX 1080 could
definitely handle that
yeah and 75 Hertz that resolution no
this is probably my bias because I
experienced 3440 by 1440 before I looked
at 2560 by 1080 screen it's been it's
it's a pretty nice update oh yeah and
and the 1080 can can handle it yeah and
absolutely then you're totally golden
with your inexpensive 1080 hall-of-fame
with the broken switch on the back
because honestly that's which it doesn't
matter just just load up the Galax or
afterburner or either of those apps and
overclock it yourself and you're just
fine yeah okay
$5 why don't Frankel noctua etc self
thicker fans say two inches thick as an
alternative to using radiators stacking
fans probably will be as good as an
alternative to use instead of doing
push-pull having just push but the push
fans are twice as thick and maybe the
blades are beefier or something I don't
know if thicker fans are thicker blades
would necessarily equate to they
definitely exist and if you're
especially in enterprise space like the
variety of different fans that they have
that go up to really high rpms and stuff
is pretty interesting and I've seen I've
definitely seen the big big beefy ones
that are super thick that you probably
have really good static pressure and
everything like that I'm imagining
it's a combination of like existing
tooling for manufacturing which makes
the cost for the sort of typical 120 mm
meter 25 millimeter thick fan just a lot
less expensive to make yeah that's
probably what it boils down to it's
possible that a fan that thick might
also be louder than two fans half of its
size yeah if you want to be less cynical
you could say they've probably tested
different thicknesses and found that the
thickness that they're current that most
of the fans currently have is the most
effective when it comes to thickness
yeah compared to effective cooling or
static pressure performance I use switch
but who knows yeah thank you for your
donation though thank you Jason H $5 I'm
currently gaming on a 2013 MacBook are
NZXT pre-built worth it right now
looking for a 1080 gaming / 3d modeling
rig I did a video on this watch the
video it's out oh yeah you're the meal
detail they say that they do um it's
actually sorry I just got a big donation
is yeah it's it's actually pretty good
you can get all the parts for MSRP at
least when I did the video I'm sure it's
still that way so do it now before they
change it before you know you have to
pay double triple the price for a GPU or
something watch the video I posted it
maybe two weeks ago it's up there and
then finally our last termination that
just rolled in Meijin the heat over $200
magic Meijin Meijin my god I mean I
