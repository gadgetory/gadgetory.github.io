channel so a few weeks back my x99 ud5
Wi-Fi board that was in my main test bed
tragically passed away after a freak
liquid cooling accident coping with the
immeasurable loss forced me into a
downward spiral marked by an unkempt
appearance and poor personal hygiene I
think we're still in the spiral but the
kind folks over at gigabyte heroically
came to my rescue by sending me a shiny
new x99 new t4p
so I could continue scratching my
incessant benchmarking itch before I
screw it down to my test bench and let
the dust pile up begin however I figured
I'd conduct a brief overview on the
board for those of you considering a
system build on Intel's enthusiast
platform so what we have here is an X 99
board with a 2011 v3 socket for your
haswell-e CPU that currently retails for
about 270 dollars aboard the matte black
PCB you get eight DIMM slots with
quad-channel ddr4 memory support for
kits up to 3,000 and 333 megahertz with
a max capacity of 128 gigs which is sure
to make us drool over the thought of
readily available 16 gigabyte ddr4
modules above the socket is your VR M
covered by a modest heatsink with
tasteful gold accents and some ultra
durable branding a heat pipe exiting the
right side makes its way down and
connects to the heatsink of our x99
chipset also sporting some gold flair
and a yellow LED that stays lit when the
board is powered on though you do have
the option to turn it off by unplugging
the LEDs to pin wire from the PCB you'll
find plenty of SATA 3 connectivity in
its usual location with six ports
natively controlled by the x99 chipset
but support raid zero one five and ten
and to the left are four additional
ports which support HCI and IDE only
giving a support for a total of 10 SATA
6 gigabits per second drives we also get
a single SATA Express port for such
devices rounding out the storage
Department gigabyte has included a dual
m2 slot that supports either a SATA or
PCIe m2 SSD although we're still limited
by the number of PCIe m2 drives
available the generous number of PCIe
lanes on haswell-e
assures us that this board will be well
equipped for their mainstream arrival
to slot accommodates em key drives
measuring 60 or 80 millimeters long but
bear in mind that occupying the slot
will render your SATA Express and two of
your ex 99 SATA ports unavailable right
beside the m2 slot as an additional slot
intended for an MDOT two Wi-Fi module if
you wish to add one in the future as you
can see here I was able to use the
surviving module that came with my now
deceased ud5 Wi-Fi zooming out a bit we
see that both end up two slots live
right in the middle of our PCI Express
gen3 slots four of which being x16 slots
allowing for up to four way crossfire or
SLI configurations the first and third
slot run at x16 speeds while the second
and fourth operate at x8 this bottom
slot however does share bandwidth with
the top slot forcing it to run at x8
when both slots are populated if you're
doing a 2-way on this board you're gonna
want to use slots 1 &amp;amp; 3 with 3-way
configurations using slots 1 3 &amp;amp; 4 I
should also mention here that having a
5820k installed changes the operating
speed of that second slot to x8 and the
fourth slot to x4 due to the CPUs lower
number of PCIe lanes shuffled in between
the x16 slots you will also get three
PCIe by one slots
though I won't be pumping much audio out
of this board once it's in the testbench
gamers and some content creators may
benefit from the onboard real text sound
chip with built-in rear amplifier which
supports stereo for 5.1 and 7.1 channel
audio as we've seen on other similarly
priced motherboards a trace outline
helps to eliminate noise and
interference by separating the sound
chip from the other components on the
board the trace also plays an aesthetic
role when the various LEDs lining its
path glow yellow when the system is
running I'm already envisioning a white
and yellow themed custom water-cooled
rig with this board I'm gonna call it
yellow snow if you'd rather not have the
LEDs you do have the option to disable
the lighting in gigabytes app center
software moving on to the smaller
connectors scattered about the board in
the top left corner is the first of five
for pin fan headers with the CPU fan
header located just below the socket to
the left of your vrm heatsink is the
eight pin CPU plug and on the far right
you'll find your 24 pin ATX connector
just below that as a USB 3 port and a
CPU mode switch that switches between
the standard
2011 and 2083 pin socket modes which
theoretically grants you hire over
headroom along the bottom of the board
are your front panel connectors
sandwiched between two more fan headers
a clear CMOS jumper 2 USB 2 connectors
TPM header a 4-pin molex plug that can
be used to deliver more PCIe power to
your multi-gpu setups for added
stability and spdif out and HD audio
connectors just above the bottom PCIe
slot you'll find a Thunderbolt header
for add-in cards your CMOS battery and
two chips indicating a dual BIOS a main
BIOS which boots on default and a backup
BIOS in case the other one gets damaged
or becomes corrupted finally to the left
of the top PCIe slot is the last fan
header and a two pin connector for the
LED backlight rear i/o shield which I'll
show you guys in just a moment on the
rear i/o you get two ps2 ports for older
mice and keyboards for USB 2 ports and 6
USB 3 ports the white one takes
advantage of gigabytes cue flash feature
for easily updating your BIOS with a
thumb drive you get an rj45 Ethernet LAN
port an optical s/pdif out and mic and
audio jacks for up to 7.1 channel sound
lastly there's a metal antenna bracket
for that optional and up to Wi-Fi module
just when you thought the list was over
it's time for accessories you get a
user's manual installation guide a funny
looking coaster for black sleeve SATA
cables two of them straight the other
two right angle an SLI bridge and
crossfire bridge both ribbon style too
hard PCB 3-way SLI bridges with varying
sizes for different slot configurations
a hard PCB SLI bridge for four-way
setups an 8 pin cable to prevent over
current protection and that backlight IO
shield that lights up neon blue so you
can easily see your ports when messing
around with cables behind your case like
the audio trace LEDs you do have the
option to turn this off through
gigabytes app center software or by
simply leaving the 2 pin cable unplugged
I was really glad to find out that I
already knew my way around the board's
UEFI since it is the same exact one on
board the x99 gaming g1 Wi-Fi that lives
inside my personal desktop it has
everything you need for a basic BIOS and
there's even an enthusiast mode with
boatloads of additional settings for
advanced CPU and memory overclocking
after getting a good look at the board I
finally popped it into the test bed and
did some overclocking myself I was
quickly able to take my 59 60 X to 4.3
gigahertz at one point to 6 volts on air
using a be quiet shadow rock slim why am
i cooling on air and not liquid you
asked
no reason when booting into the BIOS the
board does boot into an easy menu you
can quickly access things like boot
priority or SATA controller modes but I
always find myself hitting f2 right away
to get into the full and familiar UEFI
overall the BIOS on this board functions
as it should and gave me no problems
from my brief time with it my initial
impressions of the x99 new d4p are that
it's good and that it'll perform well
for what I need it for but there were a
few things missing that I would have
liked to see given the current price
point I mean for one I was kind of
surprised at the absence of any surface
mounted power or reset buttons as there
seems to be plenty of space on the PCB
for them to fit and though the board
does come with a CMOS battery and clear
CMOS jumper it just would have been nice
to see a dedicated clear CMOS button for
enthusiasts who would utilize it
frequently but that being said this is a
beautifully crafted board using high
quality parts that make it worthy of its
ultra durable classification and I'm
definitely looking forward to start
using it to conduct many many benchmarks
from here on out you guys let me know
what you think of this board in the
comments and also which x89 motherboard
is currently at the top of your list and
why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
