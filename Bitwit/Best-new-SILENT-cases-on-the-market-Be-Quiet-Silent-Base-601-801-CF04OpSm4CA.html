brought to you by fantex verdaguer enter
max be quiet and cable mod you can learn
more about their products and the links
below what's going on guys Kyle here
with bit wet here at Computex 2018
rockin the show floor at the be quiet
booth where they've got a couple new
products well let's start off with this
one this is actually sort of a revision
the Rebbe two of the very popular dark
based Pro 900 this is an excellent case
to begin with and they've just made some
some nice improvements here I'm starting
with the front do we actually get USB
3.1 gen2 type-c in place of one of the
USB 3.0 connectors on the last model
there's also the Qi charger that makes
its return I know a lot of people were
really happy about that
if you look over to this side the side
panel the tempered glass is still here
however they've added this sort of black
strip to just cover up the nasty sort of
metal cutouts and whatnot that were
underneath it previously it just makes
it overall look a lot cleaner the fans
have also been improved they were
originally 1,000 rpm a lot of users were
complaining that they just weren't
powerful enough for the high end you
know core I nine processors that they
were putting into these systems into
these cases so these are now 1600 rpm
they'll still default to a thousand rpm
out of the box but they can easily be
pumped up through software other means
controllers etc to get that additional
airflow over here you'll see some
upgraded harddrive covers these are just
like sort of vanity plates that can be
removed if you want to pop in some hard
drive trays you can mount up to five
hard drives right here on this side or
you can even pop them out so they're
still installed if you want to route
additional cables behind them let's say
you have an e ATX motherboard that kind
of overhangs or blocks the grommets
there you still have some room or a
clean means to route your cables behind
those cover plates there's also a power
supply shroud now yeh this is one of the
biggest features that I found was
missing on the first version of the DVP
900 and now this power supply shroud
spans the entire depth of the case
there's these nice cover plates on the
top that can be removed independently a
plate in the middle that if you remove
that there's it opens up the room for a
two and a half inch SSD that you can
mount there so it's visible through the
side panel window and overall it's just
a much more solidified and a matured
case than its predecessor so this is
gonna come in at around 250 260 USD I
want to say but a lot of retailers at
least for the first Rev
we're selling it well under that MSRP so
be on the lookout for that now if you're
already an existing Dart based pro 900
Rev one owner don't be too disappointed
here because be quiet is also selling
the power supply and the hard drive
covers separately if you wanted to sort
of upgrade your existing case to sort of
model this one that we don't have to buy
a completely new chassis the one thing
you'll be missing out on however is the
the USB 3.1 gen2 type-c at the front now
you guys are probably familiar with the
silent based 600 that came out a couple
years back from be quiet but now they've
got the 601 this thing looks phenomenal
it looks very similar similar design
language as the original but just
somehow
much more higher quality hour much
higher quality I should say for starters
we have replaced all of the plastic
panels with very nice metal so it's all
sort of a metal construction which gives
it a very solid weight and feel and it's
tooless removal on the side panels both
of the side panels have buttons at the
back that allow you to sort of remove
the panels to lessly and then it pops
forward haha very nice sound damping
material they've actually upgraded the
material itself as well as made it
thicker for additional sound insulation
there's a power supply shroud that goes
across the entire case looks very nice
tons of ventilation towards your power
supply so even if you wanted to flip the
fan upwards you could do that without
choking your unit
there's also harddrive trace here you
get these really lovely covers that we
saw on the Rev 2 dark based pro 900
again that can pop out for additional
cable routing options you have tons of
radio support here you can do a 360 at
the top and the front you can even
probably mount those simultaneously
because the flexible mounting strips on
this removable radiator tray that pops
up very easily one other thing I wanted
to point out is that you do have a
vertical GPU mounting solution right
here with two PCI expansion slots and a
vertical orientation you also notice on
the front panel we have some ventilation
going down the sides here let me take
off the front panel itself just to see
if if we can show you guys what's
underneath so more sound damping
material same thickness as you saw on
the side pretty much a removable dust
filter that is also tooless a little
latch there there's a look at the front
there's that front intake fan 140
millimeter
not sure if this is a silent wings it's
pure weeks pier wings air wings fans
super high quality as far as the front
panel goes you get a three step fan
controller that can connect up to three
fans you also have USB 2 and 2 USB 3 s
with a nice large power button right
there hard drive and hard drive LED and
reset button as well as far as the top
panel goes you get some ventilation at
the top here it's kind of hard to see
there are some slight slits it looks
like there's a series of six slits
overall and maybe some additional
ventilation yes you got some additional
ventilation going across the side over
here we have the silent bass 801 which
looks very similar to the 601 we just
took a look at although it's slightly
larger so if you have some some more
full-size components then maybe this is
the case for you especially if you're
looking for a very silent chassis these
sort of clear accents here on the front
these are not finished this is sort of
an unfinished piece so actually this is
either going to come in black orange or
silver trim like we've seen from
previous be quiet cases they will not
have this sort of trans transparent
effect at all you also get the fan
controller same thing as as the 601
however you can connect up to six fans I
believe and it is PWM the actual headers
on the fan hub are three pin but the the
master header that connects to your
motherboard is actually four pin PWM so
that's very nice two USB three s and a
USB 2 also let's take a look
this-this-this this unit here actually
has a tempered glass side panel whereas
the 601 did not however both of these
cases are going to be offered in
windowed and non windowed versions so
you can take your pick if you want a
favor silence for aesthetics taking a
look in here again we get a very similar
layout as we saw with the 601 here's
also a closer look at that power supply
shroud with with a really nice sort of
sort of stealthy be quiet branding there
overall just the the aesthetics of the
of these new cases are far beyond what I
would say the last generation of them
was I believe these are coming q3 don't
quote me on that I think they said q3
which will be very exciting launch to
say the least maybe we can get one of
these into the office for some testing
or perhaps a bill
so you guys let me know what you think
of these new cases from be quiet down in
