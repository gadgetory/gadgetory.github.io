an unboxing an overview of this product
from Corsair
this is their Voyager air and in a
nutshell it is a wireless media storage
device so when you break it down it
really is just a hard drive but not any
hard drive mind you you can connect this
thing to your wireless router via
Gigabit Ethernet or you can just connect
it to your Wi-Fi network via Wi-Fi and
then from there you can stream whatever
media if you've put on here movies music
whatever Word documents from whatever
Wi-Fi enabled device you choose to
stream from so whether that be your PC
or your laptop or a smartphone or tablet
you can basically have this thing on the
go or at home just kind of like a
wireless almost like a network attached
storage but not quite in a very portable
form so with that said this is kind of
an interesting new neat kind of niche
product for a Corsair to put out I'm
used to seeing them do you know chassis
these power supplies SSDs coolers and
that sort of thing so this is definitely
piqued my interest so when we have a
closer look alright so just a few things
I want to point out on the box before we
get into it all first of all it tells
you that you can stream up to 5 HD
movies at a time from this thing so
that's really nice right that kind of
promotes this thing as being a nice
little media hub which is very useful
especially if you have multiple people
trying to access the files or stream
video from this device at the same time
so up to 5 videos I'm not sure if this
is what if this stands for music as well
and wonder how many songs you can
simultaneously stream hmm I'll have to
look into that right here it says you
have a rechargeable lithium ion battery
in this link so you could essentially
power this up in the car right without
any kind of connection for power as long
as you have a Wi-Fi signal in the car
it's it should essentially work just the
same so that's really nice they haven't
listed it here but this is a 60 200
milli amp battery and it is offering up
to 7 hours of continuous video streaming
which is pretty good for a little device
like this and even though this is
primarily targeted towards users to be
using it wirelessly you can also act as
a straight-up external hard drive with a
USB 3.0 connection they've included a
cable which I'll show you in a sec so
you're gonna get awesome USB 3.0 speeds
if you don't want to use the wireless
for whatever reason but yeah they're
advertising 120 megabytes per second
read and write
so not too shabby and then lastly here
is just saying you know this is we've
intended this to be a wireless device so
it is 802 11 B G and n compatible and it
does have a wireless range of 90 feet so
as long as you're streaming this thing
from you know whatever Wi-Fi device and
you're 90 feet or closer you should be
just fine
I went on the back I did want to point
out that there is nothing it's just a
bunch of market e-text II salesy stuff
like Flutie Flutie flucos there but this
stuff right here is I know pretty
Specter it's informational but I'm gonna
get into all that right now alright guys
so upon opening up the box you will find
your user's manual the drive itself
which I will get more into you in just a
sec look how pretty that is
ooh Mac's a little travel pouch for I'm
guessing your accessories because drive
doesn't really seem to fit inside of it
maybe maybe just barely yeah okay sure
it's a nice little travel pouch there
for storage or whatever here we have in
wall adapter so it's actually a two
parter it looks like so here's your USB
wall charger and they've included the
add-on attachment your North American
standard metal prongs right there so you
can kind of just snap that in place like
so and voila your wall charger and of
course they've given you a USB to DC
cable to work in tandem with that
charger and oh they give you a car
charger as well look at that so DC to
USB so you can actually charge your
drive while you drive fancy that
and then lastly for accessories you have
your USB 3.0 cable like I said you can
use this drive as a typical old-school
external hard drive so if it won't be
that old school because it's USB 3 full
alright guys and that brings me to the
drive itself this is the star of the
show you can see that it is somewhat
covered in red accents all on all three
sides of them the bottom and it doesn't
really serve any kind of functionality
it's strictly there just for aesthetics
but I think it makes it look rather nice
and you can kind of see they went with
some angular design here at the top of
the enclosure kind of ramps up and then
wraps down once again just for the sake
of aesthetics but it makes it look
rather stylish you've got some Voyager
branding right there
err on both sides and on the bottom here
we've got four rubber feet basically to
prevent your drive from slipping sliding
around on whatever desk you put it on
and it also prevents it from scratching
whatever surfaces it's aligned on the
front here you've got some LED indicator
lights so you've got power so you slide
that over it turns on you got a blue LED
right there and this is your battery LED
indicator so essentially if it's a
hundred percent charge it'll be green
it'll turn amber like it is now if it's
charged anywhere from 20 to 99 percent
and if it gets below 20 percent it will
turn red and at that point you should
probably charger over here you've got
your DC power LED so essentially if you
plug this guy into the wall using that
wall adapter that's included or if you
plug it in to your car and you're
charging it there that LED will just
light up essentially telling you that
it's being charged and it's being
powered by DC power anything other than
the internal battery and lastly you've
got your Wi-Fi LED indicator light there
so much in the same fashion as we did
with the power switch she kind of just
switch it over and now you can see it's
lit up blue letting you know that we are
we have enabled Wi-Fi connectivity on
the back Leslie you have some
connectivity as well you've got your
Gigabit Ethernet USB 3.0 and your DC
power alright guys and now for a very
quiet demo as my roommates just went to
bed so here you can see the drive
plugged into my 600 T via USB 3.0 with
the included cable and it is plugged
into a USB 3.0 port right there on the
front panel and our specimen for this
experiment will be this game of thrones
file that I have it's not HD or anything
but it will let us know if we can
playback this video and stream it so
here you've got the Voyager air just
kind of plug and play this is the first
time we've plugged it in just pops up in
my computer no problem so this is an
included video that just comes on your
drive and you buy it
no need to watch that it's kind of kind
of boring and so let's just drag this
over drag and drop so putting
gameofthrones on the driver right now
it's about half a gig as you can see
there it only took about five seconds or
less so pretty speedy transfer speeds
right there so let's see if we can
stream it from my phone alright guys so
as you can see the drive is still
powered on however we have no more
cables attached to it we've gone
completely wireless at this point so now
we're just gonna try to connect and
access that drive from my phone so go to
my wireless networks here and you can
see right there void your air pops up
right away connect sure why not
just give it a sec okay whatever
alright now basically you go to your
Voyageur air app you can just search for
Voyager air in your app store and it
should be one of the first ones that
pops up it's a completely free app it's
a relatively easy to use so you go to
folders and there you go so you've got
your crappy introduction video and
you're awesome Game of Thrones episode
so we're going to try to play it across
our fingers mmm
alright look at that come on started in
the middle but I think that's cuz I was
messing around with it earlier so there
you go it actually looks pretty decent
to be honest
granted it's on a 4.5 inch screen and
whatnot but there's absolutely no lag
from what I can tell no lag from
streaming so it's actually streaming
pretty nicely you can scroll through
look at how just snappy it is just boom
Tirion about to get effed up
I love the shells Oh chief stated the
brothel alright guys that is gonna wrap
it up for this unboxing and overview of
the Voyager air from Corsair and once
again this is the one terabyte model in
red thank you all for watching
