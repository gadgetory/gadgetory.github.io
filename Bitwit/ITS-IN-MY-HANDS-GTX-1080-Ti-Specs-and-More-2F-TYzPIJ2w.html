channel I am here in San Francisco yet
again this time covering Nvidia and
their editors day and they've got a
bunch of good news
some of which I'm going to share with
you right now I don't have like all the
juicy details I'm pretty much just
regurgitating exactly what they told us
earlier today by the time you watch this
you probably have already seen or heard
about the streaming events that Nvidia
just held where they announced pricing
that's the one spec or the one thing one
detail I don't have right now but
everything else should be pretty much
accurate so right off the bat GTX 1080i
is the main thing I think that we're all
most excited about and there's a couple
interesting facts about this card that
we didn't really expect a lot of the
rumors were actually false which kind of
is exciting other were more surprises
that way first of which we've actually
got a slightly new cooler I wouldn't say
it's brand new it looks pretty much
exactly the same as the Titan X etc
however it does have twice the pooling
area and that's according to Nvidia
going to drop the core temps about 5
degrees Celsius I should say that's 5
degrees over the GTX 1080 if you were ok
with operating at the same low
temperatures then you would basically
just get quiet or acoustic experience so
that's kind of nice we're also seeing
35% more gaming performance this is
again take this with a grain of salt
dissolve from the manufacturing slides
35% gaming performance over the GTX 1080
which is huge I think the gtx 980ti was
only about 25% over what the 980 could
achieve so that's also very nice just
some of the hard core specs here GP 102
so yes we are using the same die as the
Titan X you've also got 12 billion
transistors 1.6 gigahertz on the core
clock speed 28 SM is 128 cores on each
of those with 3584 CUDA cores again same
as the Titan next we thought it was
going to be cut down it's not we also
got 28 geometry units 224 texture units
88 ro PS and 11 gigs of gddr5 X which is
kind of interesting we I don't think
I've ever seen a video card from either
camp that has this this much memory 11
seems a little bit odd but it's just one
gig less than the Titan X had and
obviously quite a bit more than what the
GTX 1080 is currently fitted with we're
also seeing a 352 bit
memory bus with which is again sort of a
sort of new and sort of difference with
a 250 watt TDP with a six and eight pin
PCIe connector so you're gonna have to
bust out a few more cables one extra
cable over a ten eighty again we don't
know the price but NVIDIA has said at
least at the time filming this video but
NVIDIA has claimed that there's not
going to be any founders Edition tax
where you saw a premium price for the
founders Edition card over what the AI
bees were offering that's according to
Nvidia that's not going to be the price
or the case we're gonna be C be seeing
that's a 1080i price very similarly in
line with adding board partner offerings
so in other news this is the last bit of
information I want to share with you
guys before we part ways Nvidia is going
to be selling for the first time ever
overclocked cards which is kind of
interesting but this is more focused on
the memory block itself as opposed to
the GPU for clock sort of using the GTX
1080 being sold with 11 to gibbets per
second gigabytes per second clock speeds
on the memory clock and the GTX 1060 up
to nine so very interesting more detail
soon to come of course you guys should
stay tuned and subscribe to my channel
for more tech stuff and my full review
of the 1080i when it finally launches
very very soon I don't have the launch
date either but you probably do because
you've probably already watched the
stream you can put it in your video
description I'll put it in my video
description thank you Paul and thank you
Paul for holding the camera thank you to
Jay for letting me borrow the camera
because mine died in the middle of
filming the first time and I'm rambling
now so have a good one guys I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
