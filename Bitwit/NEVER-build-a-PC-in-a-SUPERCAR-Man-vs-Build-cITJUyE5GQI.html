versus build I thought you know hey what
better I get a drive an awesome car kyle
has to suffer you know it's a win-win
for everybody
this has been a very interesting
experience the bill was not quite as
challenging as I thought so much as as
was Josh just having to be that close
with him in a confined space so I was
invited back to man versus build and at
first I wasn't really know I was cut
surprised because I'd already been on
the show but once I mentioned that
exotics were involved then I was
today I'm out here in the desert of Las
Vegas Nevada with these jokers and what
what the hell are we doing here so you
two guys got to build passenger seat in
each car on and I'll Drive and then
since these are expensive and I don't
want to buy them the way it works is if
you're driving you're responsible for
damage to the outside of the car if
you're building you're responsible for
damage to the inside of the car pretty
human you realize I am a frickin giant
and there's not much room for me in
these cars
well I can't reach the pedals so you
have to drive anyway okay
oh no I'm cool with that because I'm not
going responsible for scratching the
interior of you know the forty million
dollar car did anyone bring bubble wrap
okay so you're not building them I don't
want to would you be willing to build
and Jase please I mean it's not as fun
but I got a millimeter Wow so then Jay
decides I'm not building so yes Massah
go
okay well didn't swap sides okay I guess
you're on the build team I appreciate
you Jay get over here okay so now you
guys are gonna build passenger seat in
these cars well we have to be tortured
by driving them us versus you sounds
easy
no no no see this is kind of like think
of like a three-legged race right you
guys both have to finish your bills so
to get that done work together in
separate cars mind vibes whatever but if
one of you doesn't make it neither one
of you makes it okay so you know so
tacks helping us out on this and I
originally thought we were just running
down to the Colorado River had to build
at the time but they update me this
morning we have to get from here to the
Colorado River and back in two hours and
we cannot even start the build until we
get the Colorado River see and I think
what they're trying to do is they're
trying to nerf the fact that we have
these cars cuz it doesn't matter if you
have a Lamborghini Huracan if you're
stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
getting them out of Las Vegas it's not
like you guys know how to drive cars
anyway okay okay little man you want to
go there yeah you want to ride in the
trunk hey you can't fit in the trunk I
can't whoa whoa whoa where you going
he's gonna get my car I wonder if your
head than Ferrari dude Jesus man
ok unless you don't want to build now ok
I'm not a Lamborghini guy and so I'm
taking the Ferrari I'm sorry you're
taking ok you're taking this Ferrari ok
least you got a drop top I guess nope
it's Las Vegas I'm putting the top up
I'm not getting sunburned for this
what
the other side is gonna be working
maybe you trying to build while dealing
with this card just Roughness so wants
to roll backwards it's crazy I've never
had an automatic wanna roll back their
support
the card the card is now angry about
life right now why I'm now going faster
you got a Lamborghini your own 62 all
right so we've made it to this pit stop
in a record time but the clock is still
ticking at this point on and I basically
have to build an entire system in each
of these cars while these eggheads tried
getting us back to Vegas somehow hey and
you know while we are busting our butts
trying to drive these cars operate air
conditioned everything you guys let's
put together two mini ITX systems say
you know compact cars compact systems
you got the zotac mini cards so that
should help you out I mean that's pretty
easy it's a mini ITX board which is
small which is easy
yesin ty'lexus all stuff and then we'll
get back to Vegas I'll beat you fun
sized parts for fun sized people exactly
we got this exactly but you know the
clock is still ticking so three two one
go
we got to get down there when we did say
we're gonna stop everything is frickin
timed right now so what are these I'll
pull up
I'll stop quick you hop out pop out you
know get the other trunk
whatever you think you can fit me I
probably won't be and everything so
maybe the case motherboard CPU and RAM
okay okay and then I'm gonna get the key
out so I'm ready to go when we get there
so we don't any issues so it's time to
get out of the car and get all the parts
out of the trunk and for whatever reason
the front is not opening the hood is
just closed Josh's trying to hands me
the Bob I'm trying it's not working for
whatever reason and then Allah and J all
of a sudden just surpass us and all of a
sudden the types of turn and I don't
feel quite as confident as I guessed it
I run out there I see that cow is
already there but examine some issues
trying to open it so I'm just like you
know what I got this so I grabbed
everything I can cancel stuff to Jake go
grab some work come back in it's cramped
inside but we take off and I'm just like
yes I have a head start on this
crap
I can't start it again until you get
back in is it closed all the way
oh my god that was not closed thanks
you're eating it goes down down to the I
don't we don't want this crap anything
like that's carbon fiber
reporter this car rubber here Debbie get
oh man but truancy okay he knows
anything
yes I guess it's better
so basically the idea here is that both
of these builders have to complete the
challenge to win it's not a race so I
can see the intensity in their eyes as
we do this which is kind of surprising
to me because if one gets farther ahead
to the other they're just helping the
other builder out so I'm pretty sure
Kyle is gonna rush this and in the end
he's only helping in it but what they
don't know is that we are planning a
builder switch we're about halfway
through the challenge we are going to
force them to hop in the other car and
complete the other competitors build so
the faster they build the more they're
helping the other person
Kyle seriously how important it is to
look at the road when you're driving a
car like this you look ahead okay well I
was just it was a teaching moment Kyle
driving is sucking more and more by the
minute
no your fingers
your fingers
well you know
not having tested this previously I
figured it would be somewhat cramped on
the inside of the Huracan but what
really turns out to be the problem is
not so much the room it's just it's a
cave you know it's dark inside matte
interior we're building in a black case
of black spruce and house constantly
having to juggle all the components it's
like Jenga of hardware
that's what we have the
we're going over right now
I don't know I'm like then we just need
gas so I stopped building what is this
what's happening I feel kind of stupid
right now because I've just been told
that we're getting gas for a refill and
little do I know that Jay and Josh are
actually plans just swap me and Anna so
that we have to take on each other's
bills three Dukes of Hazzard
sorry there's a freaking computer in
here with me Josh
she's a thirsty girl you got some time
video bathroom
I think I already did but then I see cow
get off the parts of the swell so I'm
just like oh what's going on for
swapping bills it's a mess in here
Tasmanian Devil lived in here so I look
down at Ana's build and hardly anything
is plugged in including the front panel
connectors which I was really dreading
for my build so now it's like oh great
I've already done all this stuff I get
to do it again
remember Jay these are public routes
yeah slide 11 okay well we're not even
on the actual drug game just the parking
lot kind of still so I just just take
her easy all right just ease our it I
don't let you know what I don't like I
will just be fried ever
keep the camera crew in mind we don't
want to get too far ahead of them or
anything
comes
Oh Jay it's a freeway when I first heard
that we were using a GTX penaity for
this bill inside the core 500 I kind of
freaked out but thank God for Zeb Tech
and then making a miniature version of
the cart because it made installation
that much simpler and we were able to
plug into the power supply cables a
whole lot easier
dr. graphics card installed got the
cover of the case on thumb screws
installed build complete man versus
build teaches you nothing else it should
teaches one thing pretty much anybody
can build a PC and these guys can build
one in these exotic cars hammering down
the road one of the best things about
that you can recreate it if you want you
can rent any of these cars plus some
other incredible one squirrel - exotic
so another big shout out to them for
helping us out and making this man
versus build a reality it's been a very
long hot and tiresome day and as much
fun as I had I'm really disappointed
that we didn't get the systems to post
but you know what we both got to drive
in super cars for the entire day so I
still feel like open air fortunately I
don't know if maybe it was builder error
or driver influence of bouncing them
around whether dealing with delicate
Hardware it didn't work but in the day I
got to drive a super car so I don't care
this is a fun experience I have I've
done other challenges in the past which
also put us in a Humvee
goes me in heaven and we nailed it so
you know this is another success I like
it in more experienced
commit up the car like this Wow I think
we're good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
