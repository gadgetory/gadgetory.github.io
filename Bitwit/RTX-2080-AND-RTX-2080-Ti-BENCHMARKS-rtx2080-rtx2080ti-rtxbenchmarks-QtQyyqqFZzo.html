embargo has finally lifted for the r-tx
2080
and the r-tx 2080 TI the brand-new
Turing based GPUs from Nvidia and we're
finally gonna get to take a look at how
these badboys perform really quick I
want to acknowledge that there are
probably a ton of r-tx videos in your
sub bucks right now but for whatever
reason you decided to click on mine so I
just want to say thank you very much I
do appreciate it and I can tell on the
look of your eyes that you're only
slightly disappointed that you've
settled on me but anyway we have a lot
to talk about for this launch so let's
dive into it for starters we will not be
discussing our TX that's suite of
technologies including ray tracing and
DL SS and a bunch of other features
today because that hasn't really been
implemented in many games ahead of this
launch for obvious reasons so perhaps
we'll do a dedicated video or a piece on
that later on that really just leaves us
to look at the raw performance of these
cards today and how they stack up
against existing GPUs on the market so
let's let's just dive right into things
here starting with the RT X 2018 I put
this thing on an open air test bench and
it kind of blew me away I kind of saw it
coming to some degree because of the
seriously revamped cooler here but this
thing is cool and quiet AF it actually
exceeded my expectations in that regard
more on that in a second as far as the
clock speeds go we were hitting about
nineteen hundred and 20 megahertz
consistently after about half an hour to
45 minutes of GTA 5 at 1440p which is
well above the official boost clock for
this card of 1800 I believe yeah it's
about 120 megahertz over at what the
rated boost clock is for this card so
that was really nice as far as
temperatures go 69 degrees Celsius not
only is that the best number ever but
it's incredibly cool probably making
this the coolest running Founders
edition card in history very impressive
stuff and it was really really quiet
while doing it not not 69 but nevermind
the cooler on both of these is whisper
quiet in fact the 28 EP I was equally
quiet as the 2080 they're about the same
in terms of
there's a faint bit of wine just a
little bit of wine on both cards but
it's so minimal that there's no way
you'd be able to hear it inside of a
proper case even if it even on the open
air test bed
two feet away from me I I it could have
been off and I wouldn't have known if it
weren't for the spinning fans so very
good job to end video on these new
coolers I like them even more now
because I was kind of iffy about the
aesthetic initially but now that I know
how well they actually perform in
practice I'm on board 100% of course you
could expect the 2080 TI to get a little
bit warmer than its little brother here
because it's got a much faster chip on
it but not so much so only 73 degrees
Celsius at its hottest underload and I
was really impressed to see that as well
that's that's been as hot as some of the
really good adding board partner cards
from the 10 series we were able to
achieve so again kudos to Nvidia for
that and of course since thermals were
in check we did see some really nice
boosts clocks up to eighteen hundred and
seventy to eighteen hundred and ninety
megahertz it was kind of hovering within
that range under load which is again
significantly higher than the cards
rated boost clock of sixteen hundred and
thirty five megahertz so very impressive
stuff all around let's quickly talk
about our testing hardware I decided to
use the core i7 8700 K overclocked it to
five gigahertz on all cores simply
because it's the fastest gaming CPU on
the market and I wanted to reduce CPU
bottlenecking as much as possible of
course we did encounter some of that as
you'll see in a moment but it did
certainly help bring it to a minimum 16
gigs of tritons e ddr4 at 3200 speed was
also used on top of an asus rog Strix z
390 g gaming motherboard as far as the
other cards that we tested alongside the
RT x GPUs you can see on the right side
we tested the gtx 1070 1080 @ n 80 TI
all founders Edition and all these cards
for today are running stock by the way
and in our only AMD representation here
is an RX vague of 64 that was a
reference card I did have an asus strix
model that was a rx Vega 64 but I felt
it would be semi unfair to use an admin
board partner card along with all these
founders Edition cards last bit of info
here that I promised benchmarks I ran
eight applications six of which were
Triple A games run at three resolutions
each including 1920 by 1080 2560 by 1440
and 3840 by 2160 also referred to as
or k that gives us a total of 20
performance benchmark slides which is a
lot to take in so I'm gonna let you guys
absorb all that data and then we'll
circle back talk about it and close the
video up with some closing words and
that'll be that
so without further ado ladies and
gentlemen here's the moment you've all
been waiting for your benchmarks for the
r-tx 2080 and the r-tx 2080 TI
alright that was a lot of data that I
just threw you guys hopefully you're
still standing if you are great let's
continue let's take a look at the
average performance uplift that we saw I
just combined all the average frame
rates across the board for all all six
of our games in order to get some
figures that show us just how much
faster the r-tx 20 80 and 20 atti cards
are then the other cards in our
benchmark suite today so if you take a
look at 1080p we'll break this down by
resolution the r-tx 2080 saw a 38%
uplift over the gtx 1070 not too
surprising there only a 17% bump over
the GTX 1080 it's direct predecessor
which again isn't too surprising because
remember at this lower resolution were
we're a little bit CPU bottleneck so
we're gonna start to see that gap
widened between the 1080 and the 2080 as
we scale up in resolution and kind of
following suit here the r-tx 2080 saw
just a 2.1 percent bump over the GTX
1080 Ti and you want to pay close
attention to these two figures when
comparing the 1080i and the r-tx 2080
because they're more or less the same
price at least the price that the 2080
supposed to start at and the price that
you can currently find a 1080 TI for
online so it's gonna be a very relevant
cell to be looking at through throughout
the course of this little slide here so
the r-tx 20 ATT I saw a forty seven
point five percent bump over the ten
seventy a twenty five percent bump over
the ten eighty and a nine point two
percent uplift over the gtx ten atti
which i guess you would expect if you're
paying a thousand dollars starting for
this particular GPU at 1440p the r-tx
twenty eighty yielded a sixty two point
nine percent bump over the gtx ten
seventy a thirty two point eight percent
bump over the gtx 1080 which is quick
pause right here thirty two percent
thirty to thirty five percent sometimes
even forty percent in some cases that's
about how how much faster the GTX 1080
was over its predecessor the GTX 980 but
if you guys remember that those both of
those cards launched at around the same
price of $5.99 and the difference here
is that the r-tx twenty eighty is
launching at $100 more than 599's $6.99
that's that's how you math so bear that
in mind we're getting about the same
performance over generation performance
that we've seen over the last three or
four years but now we're paying $100
more for for that privilege so something
to keep in mind and we also have a 7.7
percent bump over the gtx 980ti
very close and performance here that 10
atti and that r-tx 2080 the r-tx 20 ATT
I saw an 88 point seven percent uplift
over the 1070 it was fifty three point
nine percent faster than the GTX 1080
and twenty four point seven percent
faster on average than the GTX ten ATT I
finally at 2160p which is a very
relevant resolution in my opinion for
the RT X 20 and twenty a TTI
because anyone spending seven hundred to
a thousand dollars on a GeForce GPU is
probably looking at the 4k gaming
experience I would have to imagine so
what we see here is the RT X 2080
pulling ahead of the ten seventy by
seventy two point seven percent around
to 41 percent uplift over the GTX 1080
and still a very marginal eight point
seven percent bump over the ten eighty
TI the Big Dawg RTX 2080 T I saw a 116
point eight percent bump over the gtx
1070 a seventy seven point six percent
increase over the ten eighty and it was
thirty-six point eight percent faster on
average than the gtx 1080p i clearly
there's a wide range of performance
uplift here but one thing's for sure is
that these are TX cards really shine
best at higher resolutions when you
become more GPU bound and are less
reliant on the CPU you won't get
bottlenecked as much that's when you
really get the most out of these cards
so some incredible numbers here some
very compelling percentage uplifts over
over the last gen but of course
performance is only one slice of the pie
when considering what GPU to buy and
that rhymes so it must be true we also
have to consider pricing so let's let's
do that so taking a look at our frames
per dollar here we can sort of see at a
glance what kind of value each of these
cards offers that's their price to
performance ratio of course and you can
see the pricing next to each of the
cards on the Left I determine these
prices while the r-tx cards are really
easy to price out because they're
they're official numbers from Nvidia
those are the starting prices for the
twenty eighty and twenty atti
but the other cards I kind of just went
to Amazon and Newegg and tried to find
some of the cheaper the lower lower
priced cards
from each category made sure that they
weren't on sale or anything like that so
the dollar amount that you see here are
pretty indicative of what these cards
can actually be purchased for today so
starting at the top here the gtx 1070 in
the lead at three point six seven FPD
this is still the best bang for the buck
card out of the bunch that's typically
what we've seen from the 70s cues in the
past from Nvidia so it's really no
surprise here it's still a fantastic
card even a couple years down the line
it is the best bang for the buck right
now follow very closely by the GTX 1080
at three point five nine FTD also a very
great value right now the GT X 1080 has
also come down in price all these cards
have really just plummeted in price in
recent months due to the mining Cray
sort of dying off so that's really
helped them come back with really strong
value propositions once again so being
had for as low as 479 if you can find a
deal even cheaper than that a GTX 1080
is still a really strong contender and
offers the great value overall the r-tx
28 II wasn't half-bad itself at 3.1 to
fpd it's definitely a bit lower than the
the two cards above it but it's still
not a terrible deal at $6.99 it's again
at the time of filming around the same
price as a GTX 1080 Ti and you can see
here because the the 2080 has
outperformed the 1080 Ti in most games
that at the same price the 1080i is not
quite as good a value right now as the
RT X 2080 but that could definitely
shift if the pricing for the 1080i drops
after lunch or let's say you can find a
really good deal on one for Black Friday
or something like that then the 1080 Ti
is a very compelling sell over the 2080
it kind of just depends on how the
prices go now the RX Vega 64 didn't
perform too hot here with an F PD of
just 2.74 that's mainly because it
didn't perform quite as well as the GTX
1080 in most of the titles that we
tested and it's also priced a little bit
higher right now than the GTX 1080 which
overall makes it maybe a little bit less
appealing of a purchase right now that
being said I should point out that I
believe AMD has some sort of promotion
going on where you get three free games
if you happen to purchase I believe it's
an RX 570 or higher so Rx Vega 64 would
be included there of course it's going
to depend from user to user how much
value that adds to purchasing an RX Vega
64 but something to be aware of and then
finally I guess we
all expected that the r-tx 28 ET i would
rank at the bottom of this list at $999
starting then again if you're spending a
cool grand on a graphics card for gaming
you're probably not looking at value to
begin with you're just trying to get the
best balls-to-the-wall performance and
you want the latest and greatest
technology that's out there so 2.49 FBD
can't say I'm too surprised now wrapping
things up here I kind of wanted to just
give my own opinion on which graphics
cards out of the bunch that we've tested
today are best suited for particular
users based on their their needs and
based on the resolution primarily that
they're that they're gaming at so for
starters at 1080p I would recommend the
gtx 1070 as we just saw it is the best
bang for the buck option and it still
just crushes 1080p you can even be used
for 1440p as you can see here I think
it's a great quad HD option whether
you're doing 16 by 9 or 21 by 9 and the
GTX 1080 also applies here I think now
bear in mind the 1070 Ti which we did
not test today is also a solid contender
and obviously fits in between the 1070
and 1080 so bear that in mind as well
and while I didn't list it here the GTX
1080 could also be used for 1080p gaming
of course if you wanted to do like 144
Hertz refresh rate and that sort of
thing then having that extra horsepower
would come in handy
now the RX Vegas 64 does have a spot on
this list it performs very closely to
the GTX 1080 so I would recommend it for
1440p gaming as well but since it is a
bit more expensive than the 1080 right
now on average I would only recommend it
for 1440p if you decide to go with a
free sync monitor whether you have an
existing free sync monitor at home or
you plan to buy one maybe on on sale or
just in the near future then you can
save quite a bit of money on a free sync
monitor compared to a much more
expensive g-sync panel alternatives so
in that case that kind of balances out
you spend a little bit more on the Vega
card but you save quite a bit on the
monitor so in that sense I would say
Vega 64 works really well in this
scenario then at 4k at 60 Hertz I think
it's a toss-up between the gtx 980ti
and the r-tx 2080 it's really gonna boil
down to price here because the r-tx 2080
is only on average maybe 5 to 10 percent
faster than
10 atti so if you can find a good deal
on a 1080p I like especially with the
holiday season coming up and especially
with Nvidia trying to push off all their
ten series cards and clear them out by
the end of the year if you can find the
1080i for a good deal I would definitely
snatch it up because I don't personally
think of five to 10% increase in
performance is really worth the an
additional fifty to a hundred dollars
now obviously if you care about the r-tx
technology you want ray-tracing you want
to take advantage of DL s s and that
sort of thing then RT X 2080 is your man
here but if you're just looking at raw
performance then it's really gonna boil
down to what kind of deals you can find
on that GT X 1080 T I finally at 4k at
120 Hertz this is reserved for that one
percent of enthusiasts who have the
money to throw down and they don't care
about spending a thousand dollars plus
on a graphics card the r-tx 2080 Ti is
your hero here and it's really the only
car that's capable of making a dent at
this resolution and refresh rate so
there it is guys the RT x 2080 and 2080
TI you let me know what you think did
the results surprise you did they
impress you did they disappoint you in
any way let me know in the comments
below always curious to hear your
feedback tossa like on this video if you
enjoyed it it helps me tremendously and
get subscribed to the channel for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon
including more coverage of these cards
as always thank you so much for watching
have a good one and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
