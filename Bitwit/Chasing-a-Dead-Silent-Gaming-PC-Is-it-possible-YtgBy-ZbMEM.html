supe gas so on Christmas Eve last year I
put together the electrically festive
silent night build a mid-range gaming PC
optimized for the stealthiest of
acoustic profiles featuring the be quiet
silent bass 600 a passively cooled
macho's ita√∫ CPU cooler from thermal
write and an enter max digit fan list
power supply only a poorly timed racist
joke preferably at a Funeral could make
the room quieter but what if there was
still room for improvement how much fan
noise could we remove from the equation
without setting our system ablaze and
finally would it be possible to make
this Mary Machine silent to the human
ear while it slaved away drying frames
in the unit in heaven-- 4.0 benchmark
perhaps I'd have a better guess if I
weren't distracted by that subpar video
card so the initial card that I put in
this system was the MSI gaming 4 gig GTX
960 and it's about a year old now it's
it's not the worst card ever but it's
definitely a little bit dated so what
we're gonna be doing is swapping that
out as you can see it I mean I don't
know if you can tell from here but it's
actually having a hard time it's
chugging along in Unigine Heaven 4.0 but
anyway what we're going to be doing is
swapping that card out giving it a big
upgrade to this bad boy right here this
is the gtx 1070 extreme gaming from
gigabyte and it's obviously a faster
more powerful card which i think is
going to introduce a bit more heat into
our system no doubt however I think it's
also a bit more realistic of a test for
anyone who's building a gaming PC in
2016
especially towards the end of the year
we do have a couple things going for us
here with this card the first of which
is that it's going to be running its
stock frequency that is out of the box I
should say because of this factory
overclocked we're just going to leave it
at that it doesn't have much ceiling
room so we're just going to leave it as
is
and that'll help us keep thermals down a
little bit additionally it's also just
got a pretty beefy cooler on it you can
see it's it's a rather thick card it's
still a a dual slot GPU however it is
pretty sizable and it does have three
decently sized fans the only issue that
I'm seeing here is that it's an open-air
shroud which most aftermarket cards are
and that'll eject all the hot air or at
least a good portion of it into the case
and potentially heat up the rest of our
components the one I'm most concerned
about being our CPU there like our video
card we have also swapped CPUs for this
build except we're going in the opposite
direction kind of scaling down instead
of up we actually went from the 6600 K
that was initially in here to a core i5
6500 so lock skew still a core i5 quad
core chip on the skylight platform
however we are no longer overclocked we
cannot we're locked at the the turbo
frequency which is 3.6 gigahertz that
actually will help our temperatures of
anything because we're going to be
running at a slower frequency now if I
had the option I would not have made
that CPU change because I feel like the
6600 K is probably more akin to what
most high-end gaming PC's would have
however that chip is currently in use
and I was unable to actually get it in
for this test so we're gonna have to
deal with the 6500 for today as you can
see the memory has also changed what
used to be tried at Z is now ripped just
for both kits of which are from g.skill
this is a 16 gig kit just like the
original running at 26 66 megahertz and
I did have to use that older Ram kit for
something else for a different build
actually was in the giveaway PC that I
that is in my car right now waiting to
be shipped out I should probably not
leave that in my car actually I'll be
right back and the last thing that's
changed about this PC are the fan so
initially we had some peer rings to in
here get some pure rings to action which
are the original fans that came with the
case with the silent bass 600 those have
been replaced with some silent wings 3
also from the same manufacturer there's
one 120 in the front and another 120 at
the rear so those should be a little bit
quieter maybe a little bit more
effective at delivering airflow than the
pure wings - I can't imagine there's a
massive difference but if anything we
are scaling up to a newer set of fans
with newer bearing
design and all that sort of thing so I
think on that note what we need to do
here is run a baseline test with the
current setup that we have as is that'll
give us a basis of comparison for any of
the following tests so I think what
we're going to do here is probably run
15 to 20 minutes of Unigine heaven 4.0
at 1440p
and I'm going to document the frame
rates and the scores that it spits out
and that'll be the level basis of
comparison for everything else that
follows we're going to use that same
test again and again for any kind of
little tweaks that we make to the system
to make it quieter on that note let's go
ahead and fire this bad boy up
and see how she does
you
you
for our initial run the CPU stayed at a
comfortable 41 degrees Celsius on the
hottest core our GPU meanwhile
maintained a core clock speed of 2000
megahertz while hitting a respectable
max temp of 67 C if we plan to reduce
fan speeds in hopes of achieving silent
operation
we'll have to brace ourselves for higher
temps than these but considering the
maximum operating temperature for the
gtx 1070 is a blistering 94 degrees
celsius that gives us plenty of thermal
headroom to work with
still I dare not travel too close to the
Sun so I'm setting a personal cutoff
limit at 81 degrees Celsius we'll also
have to keep a close eye on how NVIDIA
GPU boost response to all of this as our
GPU temp Rises the core clock speed may
be reduced with the potential of
affecting our precious frame rates
speaking of which this initial run saw
60 7.2 FPS on average with a minimum
frame rate of 27 and a score of 1694
certainly some impressive numbers to
boast about and yet our tiny little
system remains humbly quiet
for the average user this rig is
acoustically adequate to say the least
but rarely ever these kinds of
experiments so easily satisfied while
the silent Winx fans have earned their
name and reputation for good reason
they're the only source of noise from
within the chassis apart from the
graphics card so what happens when we
turn them off
so it's not too surprising how much
quieter the system got when we removed
all the case fans in fact at that point
the only fans running in the system are
the GPU fans which is which is pretty
insane of course something is going to
suffer because of that and that thing is
temperatures so what do we get here
basically on the CPU we went from 41 to
63 degrees Celsius almost a 20 degree
hike however still very much within safe
operating temperatures actually the GPU
did great as well even better than the
CPU believe it or not went from 67
degrees Celsius to 73 so only saw a 6
degree bump
however GPU boost was like whoa hey you
can't go that fast at that temperature
so I'm gonna scale you back a bit on the
megahertz so actually the GPU core clock
went down it went from 2,000 flat to
1974 now I don't know if that megahertz
or if it's not a big deal at all sorry
for that awful pun but it really just
depends on if it affects gaming
performance or not so I did run the
heaven benchmark of course and we saw an
average frame rate of 66.7 that's half a
frame lower than than the baseline test
that's nothing at all that could be
margin of error the minimum 27 exactly
the same and a score of yeah 8 points
lower barely a dip so I think what we
should do at this point is start turning
down the GPU fans start lowering that
rpm bit by bit until we hit my cutoff
that I had mentioned before 81 degrees
Celsius on the GPU and we'll see if it's
quiet enough to be completely silent
from a foot and a half away under look
do you think we can do it we might do
this batch I honestly have no idea but
let's go ahead and run that test now
all right so as they say in the limbo
how low did we go in terms of you know
the GPU fan RPMs we actually got it down
to 50% that's when we hit 81 degrees
Celsius is at 50% fan speed the big
question here is was that still audible
the answer yes I don't know if you guys
can hear it on your end through the
sound test but it definitely picked up
for me I can hear it it is not 100%
silence so that's quite a bummer but it
is still one of the quietest gaming
experiences I've ever had on a high end
desktop system which is pretty pretty
damn impressive actually
as far as the GPU clock how much thermal
regulation did GPU boost actually
exhibit upon this spike in temperatures
we actually saw a dip to nineteen
hundred and forty nine megahertz
remember the last test was 1974 the one
before that with all the case fans going
and stuff was a flat 2000 megahertz so
we just dipped about 50 megahertz
overall from our baseline what kind of
gaming experience or what kind of
performance hit did we actually incur in
core that's when someone hands you a
Coors Light you havin incurred that
course what are we talking about so
looking at the benchmarks we actually
saw the exact same frame rates across
the board as we did in the last test
which was sixty six point seven on
average and a minimum of 27 not too bad
at all the only thing that really dipped
here was a minus one point on the
overall score 1686
to 1685 which is really nothing now it
wasn't all rainbows and kisses for
everyone all right there was one victim
in all of this with this final test and
that was the CPU our core i5 6500
actually got only 78 degrees Celsius on
the hottest core which isn't too bad but
it did spike up to 88 degrees Celsius on
the package which is you know the
package the overall temperature of the
CPU as a whole was a little bit too hot
in my opinion now of course everyone has
their own thermal threshold limits like
for me the GPU like I like to keep it 81
degrees and below even like any even
like high seventy is like oh that's
that's too warm CPUs I'm about the same
like keep it under 80 yo some people are
cool totally different yeah let it fly
for you know 89 degrees Celsius for like
five hours who cares it's not shutting
down there's no you know failsafe F
ticking in so we're good to go
but bear in mind that additional heat
will always decrease the longevity of
your hardware
not to mention that heat is gonna get
transfer to other components in your
system so bear that in mind if you're
going to take your CPU to that degree no
pun intended so in the end our attempt
to run a virtually silent gaming PC was
a failure but we did get surprisingly
close with the help of a well designed
GPU cooler it also seems that while the
core clock took a dive when the GPU was
at its hottest this had more of an
impact on my ambient temp than it did
our gaming performance and for every
part that I am disappointed that we
didn't get the silent rig I was hoping
for I'm two parts thoroughly impressed
that the system was able to operate
under load with zero case fans well
under its thermal limits now of course
he will always pose a threat to a
components lifespan but it's hard to
feel too concerned when I've seen higher
temperatures in typical chasse EES where
the case fans are typically spinning now
that's not to say that I recommend you
go unplug all your case fans immediately
but it does make me ponder the
possibilities of a fully fanless system
although I've since recommissioned my
silent wings threes as they're gentle
worrying bothers me no large amount it's
fun to imagine future hardware being so
power ficient that fans are simply no
longer needed for even the most powerful
gaming pcs at that point we'll just need
to replace them with something else to
give our systems that touch a flare but
that is gonna do it for now guys so let
me know what you think of these results
