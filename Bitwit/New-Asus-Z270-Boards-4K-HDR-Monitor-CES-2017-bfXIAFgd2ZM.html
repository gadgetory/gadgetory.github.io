to you by fractal design MSI and cable
mod check out the links in the
description below or half-life 3 will
stay unconfirmed guess where we are this
is the design Oh curve NX 3 8 vq monitor
actually that's just a bunch of text on
a wall this is the design Oh curve mx3 8
vq monitor and it's pretty beastly you
can see it's an ultra wide display it's
an LED IPS so I really good for color
correction makes all the colors pop and
stuff it says it's 29 21 by 9 aspect
ratio but that I think that might be
inaccurate because if you look over here
it says the resolution is actually 38 40
by 1600 which actually gives you a
little bit more vertical space than a
typical 21 by 9 display so I think Paul
said he was going to call this start
calling this ultra wide plus so I'm
gonna steal that for this video look at
this ultra wide plus monitor I know he's
gonna he's gonna hate me but you can
also see here it's a 37 point 5 inch
it's got Bisson built-in eight watt
speakers some people like that sort of
thing there's also an audio chip
built-in so it handles all the the
post-processing
if you wanted to get your sound out of
that in that such way it's also got a
wireless Qi charger I'm pretty sure
that's how you pronounce it actually at
the base the base of it is a built-in
wireless charger right there
I know it's spelled Qi but believe it's
pronounced Qi I don't even know if this
phones on this phone was already here
when I got here oh there it goes so
that's actually pretty cool I feel like
when I'm at my desk I usually put my
phone right kind of on the base anyway
so now we can charge while I do that
assuming assuming I ever get this
monitor in my studio but there's another
cool panel over here I think you guys
are going to really like this first off
just check out the industrial design it
looks pretty stunning this is the pro
art pa3 to you cute bit of a tongue
twister but this is a 4k display and it
is 32 inches 16 by 9 so talking a bit
more of a familiar aspect ratio here but
it's a quantum dot panel that's not just
4k but also HD are supported with Adobe
RGB you can take a look at some of the
specs here it's 85% of rec 2020 I'm
still getting familiar with all these
numbers and what exactly they mean I'm
sure some of you guys could
probably help me out on that 99.5% of
Adobe RGB so gonna be really great for
content creators you can see it's also
got Thunderbolt 3 display ports HDMI on
the video IO which is pretty sweet
this thing is I don't know I hate
actually recording videos of products
like this because it's just impossible
to show you guys how amazing it looks
unless you're actually here in person
but it is pretty stellar even just
comparing it to the LED monitor over
here which is IPS again which already
looks fabulous it looks amazing and you
just look over here like but I want this
one
this is Dawa and I want that quantum dot
with the HDR gets us really gets getting
me really excited for premium HDR
content in the near future hopefully
we're gonna be seeing that come
mainstream in 2017 let's move on to see
what else they got here
alright guys next up we've got some
motherboards here this is a z2 70 board
ROG line of course we've got the Maximus
9 apex and what good old JJ was telling
me about this board is that it is for
the most enthusiasts of enthused
overclockers so this is basically in
overclockers wet dream especially if
you're trying to break some world
records this is actually what probably
the board they're going to be using at
the hardware bot
overclocking contest that's going to be
going on during CES so that's definitely
saying something you can see it's got to
DIMM slots adding more DIMM slots does
add some interference when you're trying
to hit some high high frequencies you're
probably wondering what the heck heck
this thing is this is actually a dim m2
adapter so it's actually the regular dim
slot but they've rewired it to fit an m2
on this little board here so you can
just mount it right there kind of a
clever and interesting way to mount some
some high-speed storage in your and in
your case we've also got this little
thing here they wanted me to point this
out this is kind of like a just a little
plating it's purely aesthetic but you
can customize it however you like just
simply with a straight razor this was
actually done by hand
no like laser etching fancy work someone
just did this with a straight razor I
think they did some they traced over it
so you can kind of make the board your
own which is pretty cool and for further
customizability you've also got
full-blown RGB s all over there's
there's definitely no shortage of that
and that's of course controlled and
tuned in the aura software and it syncs
with any other or compatible components
you may have in your system pretty sweet
so just
take a look at the apex and how that was
really great for overclocking this is a
board that you want to get if you're a
really high-end custom water-cooler and
you just are looking for the most
extreme solution in fact that's probably
why they've called it the Maximus 9
extreme and I think the first glaring
thing that sticks out is this massive
water block that actually covers not
just your CPU but your vrm as well as an
M to drive that you can put right under
under this part of the block that says
extreme you can water pull your m to
drive with this this entire set up and
this is included this whole block is
included and you can see there's an
inlet and outlet here the cool thing
about this is if there's a leak in
either one of these these are at these
ports it'll actually auto shut off the
entire system as to prevent any kind of
further damage from occurring which is
pretty awesome it's all built in good to
go now you'll also take a look at some
of the fan headers here there's a just
ridiculous number of fan headers and
actually there's 12 Paul Paul pulses
there's 12
I assume you already did this board Paul
no I'm waiting really finished so I can
talk together oh but can watch my video
where I talked about in sale the same
things but Chris Chris make sure you
edit out all this part with Paul alright
alright cool bye Paul so according to
Paul there's 12 of these fan headers
what's really cool about them is that
they're actually grouped so um these are
primarily for radiators so you actually
have let's say you have a 480 at the
bottom of your case you plug in to these
4 they will also they will all act
pretty much the same you want them to
have the identical rpm things like that
all the same fan curves there's also a
group of 4 up here so if you have
multiple radiators in your system just
connected to those grouped fan headers
and you're good to go there are 4 pin
PWM all the good stuff there's also an
independent fan header scattered
throughout the board if you just wanted
to connect some basical fans I don't
know the price point on this board I
believe I would have to assume it's
going to be like 6 700 at least this
thing is just an absolute monster so
again for the best of the best you are
looking for extreme water cooling
solutions in the rig alright so you guys
know how fond I am of Mini ITX boards so
when I saw this one I kind of got all
giddy inside and screamed like a little
girl this is the Maximus 9 hero boom and
this is part of the Strix lineup it's
not an rog board but when you take a
get it you don't really feel like
they've compromised for much of anything
of course you've got your typical to
DIMM slots and your your by 16 right
there but if you look at just like the
craftsmanship and the heatsinks they are
freaking beautiful again this is one of
those things you have to see in person
but they are etched very nicely the
shapes are pretty on point look they
even fit USB 3.1 internal motherboard
header right there on the corner that is
pretty awesome and if you're wondering
what this is this is actually a cover
plate for your MDOT to drive there's an
m2 slot right here there's they actually
put it separate heat separately right
here you can kind of see that there's a
space for your MDOT to and there's a
thermal pad on the inside so you can
cool your MDOT 2 as well it's both form
and functions so even if you have a
really nasty ugly-ass MDOT to drive you
can just cover it all up while giving it
a bit more thermal dissipation than you
otherwise would without it I kind of
like the fact that they've switched over
not just MDOT twos from behind the
motherboard they put it to the front and
they've also made a nice elegant
solution for it I almost forgot to
mention this board also has an RGB LED
header all right guys that's going to do
it for me at the Asus booth here at CES
2017 they have a lot of amazing stuff
here but I really wanted to just be
super precise and only cover things that
I really thought you guys would
appreciate let me know if you like kind
of the shorter format or if you want to
see all the things into in the next
video but until next time get the hell
out ere pole get just he you can't take
him anywhere it's just ridiculous
anyway huge shout out to my sponsors MSI
fractal design and cable mod go ahead
and check them out in the description
below have a good one guys and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
