brought to you by fantex berta gear
enter max be quiet and cable Mott you
can learn more about their products and
the links below what's going on guys
calif it went here on the show floor of
Computex 2018 and there's just an
overwhelming number of brand new
products to cover here too many in fact
that I can't actually make a video for
all of them so instead I thought it'd be
kind of fun to walk around and sort of
put some of these vendors or companies
on the spot and sort of ask them what
their best new product is that they're
exhibiting here today so should be a lot
of fun why don't we go ahead
I think Thermaltake would make a good
first victims see what they got
hello hi I don't have an appointment but
I kind of was curious to shoot any one
of your products on if you have any time
to get it featured on our YouTube
channel
just a single product yeah
okay I've seen this one at CES it has it
changed has it changed in CES is there
anything new about it since January or
is it the same okay are there are there
any brand new cases that you just
announced this week all right so the
very friendly rep led me here to this
outrageous case actually truth be told
he initially wanted to show me the level
twenty which we already checked out at
CES so I said no show me something else
so he showed me this which looks like a
smaller much more simplified version of
the level twenty this is the level
twenty GT RGB it's more of a
conventional super tower as he called it
actually I believe that was the level
twenty that he called the super tower
this is more of just a full tower
chassis it's quite impressive there's a
lot of art should be going on here you
get tempered glass on both sides that's
on hinges five millimeters thick it
doesn't look like there's much of a tint
which which I actually prefer looks like
you can walk your tempered glass side
panel as well that's kind of handy if
you're if you're paranoid and stuff
about people jacking your components
there's also tempered glass at the front
here which looks fairly closed off to
air flow I will admit however there are
some some slight gaps on either side
going all the way down the case with
some 200 millimeter addressable RGB fans
that are included and for the price of
this thing which he said around 170 to
200 dollars I would very much expect
these fans to come with the case now you
get front IO or I guess side i/o with a
power button hard drive activity light
reset microphone headphone jacks and on
the opposite side it's kind of weird
they actually have two side to sides for
their for their i/o you get USB 3.1 gen2
type-c 2 USB 3 and 2 USB 2.0 ports over
here let's take a closer look at the
beauty side they do have some custom
water cooling going on right now that's
a 420 millimeter radiator that's mounted
to the back side of the case there's
also room for a 420 at the front and I
believe he he wasn't too sure on this
spec because maybe he's not the the
primary rep for this case but it looks
like you can also mount a 420 at the top
you would probably run into some
clearance issues at some point if you
were trying to mount all three of those
radiators and here simultaneously but
definitely a lot of room for activities
it also looks like there's a pump
reservoir mount bracket at the bottom of
the case that gives you some flexibility
there looks like it's on flexible
mounting strips very nice and obviously
we do get a vertical GPU mount for for
your graphics card so you can show it
off in true true glory and true glory
fashion and then there's also a power
supply shroud that is kind of kind of a
power supply shroud you can still see
there's a cutout there so you can your
power supply sticker is visible there's
a two and a half inch SSD plate on the
top of that for a single SSD and I
believe the total drive capacity of this
case assuming that you're not filling it
up with water cooling gear is for SSDs
and three three and a half inch drives
so so you definitely have some options
here the top of the case you can see
here also has mounts for two hundred
millimeter fans actually a pair of them
can be installed quite nicely they've
got some RGB fans right there which are
not included you only get those two at
the front Sports get an included
Thermaltake ring RGB fans 140 millimeter
at the back of the case for a premium
exhaust and I just noticed this Chris
actually pointed out to me I couldn't
see it from where I was standing but
there's this sort of RGB LED panel by
the motherboard tray kind of behind all
the cables and stuff just peeking out
they're sort of at a slant 45-degree
angle just for that nice little premium
touch attention to detail if you're
really into illumination inside of your
inside of your system so there you guys
have it and apparently this is the best
product that Thermaltake is showing off
at their booth here at Comdex 2018 let's
move on
hi hi hi sorry um I'm in a rush
all right and I know you got a lot of
prizes here but can you show me your
single best products at your at your
booth our booth seriously although those
products are good I know I know but
we're really on a time crunch here and
we just need you to narrow down one
product if that's that's possible
well I think we can do like multiple all
right I think this is the first
motherboard that we've talked about at
Computex so I'm actually kind of excited
it's be 450 so it's not like you know
crazy exciting but it's still exciting
this is the beat the v4 50 tomahawk from
MSI of course and it looks quite lovely
it's kind of got this gunmetal grey
theme going on and there's actually some
functionality to having this extended
heatsink as they're calling it they've
done some internal testing and found
that by extending the heatsink out just
a couple centimeters to the left over
the IO slightly overhanging it that
they've been able to drop some of the
degrees off of their VRM so that's
actually kind of nice there's also of
course we have the AM for socket for
your rise into CPU these are great the
the v4 50 boards are gonna be awesome
because it's basically the successor to
be 350 which allowed users to pop in
their rise in first gen processors but
still allowed them to overclock and do a
bunch of other functionality with a
limited budget so these are gonna be
fairly affordable compared to their x4
470 counterparts so it's very exciting
we've got quad channel memory our dual
channel memory here with four dimm slots
there's also two full-sized PCIe slots
as well you get four SATA ports there's
an m2 nvme slot right there let's count
the fan headers shall we've got one two
three and four five Wow okay we've got
five four pin PWM fan heaters and they
seem to be in rather sensible locations
it looks really nice I don't know it's
it's color neutral but it's not just all
black so there's a bit of styling to it
it's got some character the other great
thing about this board is that they've
included now a BIOS flash back button on
the back which is which is great yeah
that's that allows you to obviously
flash and update your BIOS without even
needing to install your CPU and as we
all know with Rison it gets a ton of
BIOS updates and it can be a pain to
constantly set things up if you just
want to upgrade to the latest firmware
so that also continues down here from
the B 458 Pro which I know I said I was
only gonna talk about one product but
I'll just briefly give this one I
mentioned since it's right here anyway
this is just a little bit more of a
simplified board it's probably going to
be a little bit cheaper than than the
tomahawk obviously got a lot of those
premium features like the BIOS flash
back button and and some rather beefy
heat sinks considering that's B 450
board you can expect both these
motherboards to launch sometime in the
next month or two they didn't actually
say pricing however I'm gonna guess that
these are probably gonna go for around
what there be 350 counterparts did last
year
that's MSI excuse me excuse me
do you work here good enough show me
your best products I'm in a hurry yeah
just to show me your best product where
is it all right so now we're checking
out the desk mini GT X 1080 if you take
a look at just how insanely small this
thing is my hand for scale even though
you guys don't really know how big my
hand is now don't get crazy excited here
this is actually an MX MGT X 1080 not a
full desktop size it's not max Q its M X
M so it is gonna run a little bit slower
perhaps but it's still insanely powerful
for this footprint I'm not exactly sure
what the dimensions are but you can just
tell it's incredibly compact and it's
gonna fit on pretty much any desk and
give you lots of room for your monitor
other peripherals keyboard and mouse
it's also rocking this particular model
is rocking the z 370 chipset it's
actually got in the STX form-factor
motherboard in here as opposed to Mini
ITX so that's even smaller shrinks it
down even further and they've actually
got an i7 8700 CPU in here 6 cores
what's also exciting is that they've
already said or they've already made
arrangements to support Z 390 with the
new core i-98 core CPU that's coming
from Intel later on so that's gonna be
super exciting pairing that with an MX
MGT X 1080 this is going to be an
absolute monster considering its tiny
size it's also got some Esso DIMM slots
I believe there's two of them this one
this particular models kitted with 16
gigs in total it also has three MDOT two
slots on the bottom which is absolutely
insane you could raid those you could
boot off of those it's is it's pretty
awesome there's also I believe a two and
a half inch caddy for an SSD not in this
particular model there's one that's
slightly thicker that they're playing
around with that would allow for that
additional tuna 1/2 inch SSD I
personally like the thinner form factor
though you guys know you guys know I'm a
sucker for that sort of thing on the
let's see there's tons of ventilation
all around
absolutely tons of ventilation you can
see here we've got your your video outs
from the graphics card looks like hdmi
displayport and mini DisplayPort and
quad USB 3.0 and this is your integrated
HDMI integrated GPU HD and
Ethernet and your power so obviously
you're gonna have a sizable power brick
attached to this guy there's no internal
power supply there's just no possible
way they could fit that in here the
other thing they were talking about is
that well here let me show you now this
is the slightly larger model that I was
just mentioning and they may opt for
this particular chassis if they decide
to do a Raven Ridge version of the desk
Vinny the reason for that being that the
AMD stock cooler the race I believe it
be the wraith spire just has a little
bit too much height for this particular
chassis it just doesn't clear the top so
that's why they would probably opt for a
slightly larger case but still very slim
I personally like the slimmer one they
look really nice USB 3.1 gen2 type-c at
the front we've also got a USB 3.0
header or connector power button right
here
very solid build quality it's completely
steel let's take a look at the top
slides off just like that
all that ventilation here's a look
they've got a low profile nock to a
cooler in here right now
there's the heatsink and fan for our MXM
GTX 1080 doesn't look like there's
memory installed at the moment DIMM
slots on that the SPX motherboard or
right over here and of course the triple
n dot two slots would be on the bottom
which we don't really have access to at
the moment
altogether this is going to cost you a
pretty penny now I should mention that
there is a GTX 1060 version that is
$9.99 bare-bones so it only comes with
the MXM GTX 1060 you have to add your
CPU memory and storage yourself or you
can opt for the MX MGT X 1080 version
that we have here for a whopping $1,500
that's just for the bare-bones it only
comes with the case the power brick and
the graphics card so yeah it's it's it's
really steep and it's gonna really
target a very niche market but like
asrock said they're not setting the
prices for for the for the graphics
cards at the very least which is
obviously going to eat up a bulk of the
cost here but you guys let me know what
you think of these desktop minis or
these desk meetings I should say and
that's
what's gonna conclude it here at the
asrock booth next cougars right here
excuse me oh hi hi hi sorry I'm kind of
in a rush right now I'm doing a video
where I'm showing all the best products
at Computex but I only have time to
shoot one product at your booth which
one do you want to show we have quite a
lot of these things don't care one
product only so the Cougar rep has led
me here to their absolutely insane
Gemini X ATX dual system chassis this
thing's pretty crazy looking first of
all I just want to comment on the design
language and the absolute attention to
detail with build quality here we've got
aluminum through and through it's
actually five millimeters thick I mean
this is the definition of thick and
we've also got tempered glass all around
four millimeters thick here I don't even
want to know how much this thing weighs
on its own let alone with a full system
in it or two systems for that matter so
this is one side it's got a dual chamber
design here which isn't terribly new but
you can see we've got sort of a more
conventional layout with your
motherboard your video card in a
horizontal position
there's also 240 millimeter radiator
mounts at the top and the bottom of the
case and I guess if I was building this
I'd probably flip those bottom fans
around just to have just to have them so
this intake that way you can just sort
of travel from bottom to top and out the
top of the case where it would be all
exhausted if you look at the other side
here it's come around on this side you
get a better look at the year your
business end of things where you've got
two power supplies assuming that you are
gonna go with the dual system build
you've got ATX at the top and SFX at the
bottom you can see that your mini ITX
board is somewhere in between and it's
mounted upside down GPU and everything
is inverted but it still looks really
nice and clean you can also see that we
still get the same 240 millimeter
radiators on this side of the case as
well so tons of cooling potential you
might be asking yourself well Kyle where
do the cables all go well they go right
here right in between these two chambers
is
is sort of your motherboard tray limbo
area and yes these do pull apart both of
the chambers can kind of separate that
way you can do any kind of mods and you
can get in there for cable management to
make things look all nice and tidy it's
good for servicing and then front panel
I guess we'll just quickly go over here
this is obviously your your first system
and this is your second system you get
two USB three USB 3.1 gen2 type-c mic
and headphone jacks and a power button
that I'm not going to press the system
will turn off let's take a look at the
back here now they wanted this case to
look good from 360 degrees and they've
actually got these two captive thumb
screws that pops the panel off like that
where you get a look at your i/o and
from here you can actually route your
cables through this large cutout there's
actually two of them and then they sort
of go they kind of create a tail for
your system that way everything looks
super nice and clean this is definitely
a showpiece and not for the faint of
heart this is gonna be releasing in
August for a lowly price of 899 get your
wallets ready ladies and gentlemen and I
can't find the thread on these holes so
I'm just gonna stand here in screwing
purgatory one final pretty cool thing
about this chassis is that it can be
oriented either in the current vertical
state that you see here or horizontally
and I guess just sort of like aggressive
edges and the corners of this case are
really unique in such a way where I
didn't even recognize that these two
cases were the same I thought they were
completely different because they I
don't know just the way you orient it
makes the case look so different
you got the Cougar branding now it's
right-side up and you get sort of a
top-down view of all your components
everything just sort of screams you know
attention and an elegance but in that
sort of cool gamer II way
who ducky let's see what they are lucky
ducky
excuse me hey sorry to bother you I'm
shooting a video actually and I need you
to show me your best keyboard here
they're all the best they're ducky that
was actually a really good answer
you still only get one product though
probably over at the shrine seven all
right let's go all right this is the
shine seven look at this it's a
full-size 100% keyboard and it's got
this gorgeous zinc alloy material all
around I kind of like the green although
these are featuring RGB Cherry MX
switches so I think the RGB lighting
really really beckons or really warrants
a all-black version which I'm sure
they're gonna release as well but zinc
Alawis is super nice looking extremely
durable has a great feel to it and kind
of got these sort of slanted edges on
either side they're not too aggressive
but it adds just that hint of I don't
know something special the switches
themselves as I said all full Cherry MX
and it's gonna be offered in a variety
of switches like we've got the silver
speed switches right here you can also
have your pick of the litter red blue or
brown I believe there might even be more
options don't quote me on that
there's also a lighting effects so I
believe it's this isn't a finished
product by any means so I think it's f11
yeah we have 11 changes through some
different modes and this might not
reflect exactly what the effects are
gonna look like again sort of a
prototype but some nice effects there
let's go ahead and flip it over
USB type-c very nice detachable yep
maybe it's got a nice bite to it there's
no cable channel but it does feel very
sturdy in there
you've also got fold-out feet actually
three levels so there's already a slight
incline from just the shape of the body
under here but you can pop out some
little feet if you want to slight
incline or the larger feet or a more
aggressive angle I believe we have some
dip switches here I think this is for
the function keys you want to just
arrange those however you want and
rubber grips on the bottom as well this
is a very heavy very heavy keyboard
actually which I like I really really am
a fan of heavier keyboards and this one
is super solid feeling let me try
pulling up the feet there I also like a
I also like a good incline on my
keyboards hello how are you I am at
Computex today and these keys feel
pretty damn amazing holy crap I want one
maybe I should just steal it no one
would notice okay I'm getting carried
away here where did the what did the
argv go come back come back to me hard
gb you've you
you've infiltrated my life and now I
can't live without you okay I broke
through I broke through I broke through
I think I broke their demo unit because
the lights aren't coming on anymore but
one of the cooler effects they showed me
RGB wise again if you're into that sort
of thing was an equaliser effect where
kind of looks like the keys are doing
sort of an equaliser pattern at least
the LEDs are which are actually in sync
with your in-game audio or really any
any audio source that's coming from your
system the key caps are also PBT double
shot so very high quality here and kind
of goes without saying that some seeds
in Cherry MX which is you also get that
cherry MX stem so you could swap out
these key caps for your own custom ones
in the future this keyboard is gonna
retail for a hundred and sixty US
dollars you guys let me know what you
think about price point for everything
you're getting here and according to the
rep so this is going to be arriving
sometime in July which is right around
the corner so make sure you keep your
eyes peeled for this one it'll
definitely make it into a segment of hot
and heavy hardware on awesome hardware
because uh because it's heavy and I
guess it's not really that hot it's
actually rather cool to the touch
doesn't matter well guys that's pretty
much gonna wrap it up for this little
roundup of the few products that I got
to cover today at Computex 2018 this is
also gonna be my last video for the
entire event so I just want to say a
huge shout out once again to all my
sponsors for making this trip possible
and to all of you for watching the
videos hopefully you enjoyed all the
coverage toss a like on this video if
you enjoyed it and get subscribed for
more tech stuff coming at you really
soon
have a good one guys I'll see y'all in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
