a brutal man I don't know something
snapped off and it's hurting
yikes sorry about that hey you know some
dogs sort of look like their owners what
a case makers share the same traits as
their cases that's ridiculous
no it kind of works right I mean because
like the peer-based 600 is cool right
and you're arguably cool right
the case is super quiet and you've
always been on the soft-spoken side yeah
Pete it's totally true actually there's
one more thing we have in common
what's that well after the colonoscopy I
think I also supported three sixty
millimeter radiator that like include
push pull or the pure base 604 be quiet
offers a tempered glass side panel sound
damping material and a highly versatile
design ships with a pair of powerful
peer wings two fans and intentional
support for 360 radiators click the link
in the description for more info what's
going on guys welcome back to the
channel today is pretty exciting because
I'm going to be teaching my grandpa how
to use a PC for the very first time now
he's never used a computer in his life
so it should be a pretty interesting
video and ever since I moved in with him
about two years ago he's been sort of
surrounded by PC hardware he's watched
me you know build sections of a PC here
and there as I do it quite frequently
and I think all that exposure has gotten
him curious about actually using one so
on occasion for the past few months he
would ask me if I could teach him how to
use a computer and I said sure of course
and finally we're getting around to it
today I actually built him his own
system which is right here you can go
ahead and check out that build video if
you haven't seen it yet it's pretty fun
and I think it's a pretty pretty robust
system that we have here for him
especially since he's mainly going to be
using the Internet but yeah it should be
pretty fun my expectations for this are
I think since you've never really even
touched a computer in his life I think
he's going to be a bit overwhelmed by
the whole whole thing I think they're
going to be certain things that he's
just been used to all his life doing
analog and now now he's going to have a
digital version of it and I think it's
going to be a lot to unpack it
first but I think overall it's going to
be a positive experience for him I think
a small part of me hopes that he
eventually become so proficient with PCs
that he can then help me with my youtube
channel I mean how awesome would that be
if you could just handle all the gaming
benchmarks from here on out although he
did recently leave tinfoil on the
microwave so I might have to rethink
that idea I don't really have any
reservations about teaching him how to
use a PC I think my worst fear is that
he just simply won't enjoy it or he'll
find it too complicated and give up and
then I'll have no use for the system I
mean literally I'll just have the
dowsing and gasoline and light it on
fire which I never enjoy doing so I
think on that note though we're I think
we're ready to unveil this to him for
the first time and and get his reaction
that should be kind of fun and it will
just dive into some simple lessons
simple tutorials on just how to use a PC
to get them up and running on his own
two feet so here we go guys teaching my
grandpa how to use a computer for the
very first time all right grandpa well
thank you very much for being here I
appreciate you being in one of my videos
and taking the time out of your day are
you ready to see your computer for the
first time yes okay I'm going to go
ahead and unveil for you here it is I
present to you your very first computer
whoa Wow beautiful
yeah you like it yeah cool yeah why I
made it I made it pretty for you Oh your
minute GTX 10ft yeah you like it
why not technically ATI well I just has
figured since you're browsing the web
view let's just hook it up look it up so
the first step is to turn the computer
on and what I'm going to need you to do
is stand up and if you look on the top
of the computer that button right there
go ahead and press that Bravo
that was beautiful now you can see that
the computer is is loading up it's
booting up so you have to give it a few
seconds it takes a while for it to fully
prepare here we are this is called the
desktop the desktop is basically the
first screen that you see when you turn
your computer on and you can put
different icons and different
applications on your desktop so the one
that I have here for you right right now
as Google Chrome that's the program we
use to access the Internet you're going
to want to put your hand on the mouse
and you're going to want to navigate
over to that icon with your index finger
click it twice in a row there you go
this is your your home page your home
page is basically the website the first
website you see when you start browsing
the Internet so right now your home page
is Google it's a search website that
allows you to search for anything what
would you want to search for anything is
anything you want on our talk choice
okay so you can you can click in the in
the box the search box now you can start
typing what you want to search for so
using the keyboard you can type in toys
so go ahead and find the letters for
that now you've entered the realm of
online shopping here which can be very
addicting so if you wanted to the
internet lets you buy certain products
actually there's a lot of products
online that you can buy so if you wanted
to you can add it to your cart you know
like a shopping cart obviously when
you're online you don't have a physical
shopping cart that you're pushing around
but the internet still calls it a cart
because it's something we're familiar
with so if you wanted to buy the Bugs
Bunny DVD you can click Add to Cart and
then at that point it would ask you for
your credit card information and your
shipping address and things like that so
that it can send you the DVD when it's
ready this is a new created content yeah
you can use a credit card exactly so
let's let's so that's kind of a very
basic overview of how to browse the web
just briefly but there's a couple other
things you can do including email
so basically email just as a refresher
is it's kind of like writing someone a
letter but it's all done on the computer
and it's it's instantaneous anything
that you write and send someone will
receive immediately and then and then
they can then proceed to write you back
immediately if they want to sometimes
they don't write back
just kind of sit there wondering why but
let's let's go ahead and get you
registered with an email account now
I've already created a bookmarks bar
here for you these are these are
bookmarks these allow you to access your
frequently visited websites more easily
so I've already made a couple here ones
for your email so if you ever want to
look at your email all you have to do is
click it and it takes you to the Gmail
inbox that we created for you from here
you can see all of your new emails
obviously no one's emailed you yet
because no one knows that you have an
email address and this is also where you
can write emails you can send emails to
people the way you do that is by
clicking on the red compose button just
a single click there and now you see how
this box is opened up so that box is
kind of like it's kind of like you're
the paper oh you can try and kind of
like the paper that you're going to be
writing on prepared art yes exactly so
you're going to have to type and in
order to send an email to anyone you
first need to know their email address
you kind of like the phone number right
yes so you want to send it to let's do
an email to me all right yeah
subject is like the title of your letter
or the title of your email and if you
want you can leave it blank
but it's generally a good idea to put
something in here that way when the
person receives your email they kind of
know what it's about right without
having to read the whole thing and then
you have this big the big window here
this big empty box where you can write
anything you want this you can write
dear Kyle you are my favorite grandson
in fact make that grandchild how come
you make the weak little and you will be
ghetto and oh how how you made a big
letter Oh how do you make it capitalized
yeah so the way you do that is you hold
shift and then press the key oh so like
little T would just be hitting it like
that but a big T would be holding shift
and then hitting T and once you've got
everything there you can just click the
blue send button right here you just
click it and it'll say right here in
this yellow box it says your message has
been sent
so that means probably within a few
seconds the recipient will have received
the email you just wrote so I can
actually check right now on my phone to
see if I got your email yep there it is
says dear Kyle you're my favorite
grandson in fact make that grandchild
period so thank you that was a beautiful
nicest email I've ever gotten so now
let's talk about YouTube briefly and how
to use that because it's a glorious
platform that allows you to watch a lot
of useless videos for free unless unless
it's a little trip that's about fifty a
month first two weeks or freeze it so to
access YouTube you can see I've also
added a bookmark for you right here
where it says YouTube so you can just
click that and it'll take you right
there what's what's something that you
might want to see a video of on YouTube
it could be anything you want
we aren't visual yeah those are all
videos you see about pending trending
nothing good is ever on trending so you
know you want to avoid trending at all
costs it's a long story to get into
right now but let's search for four
monkeys so the Internet's smart right so
if you start typing in monkey you'll see
all of these other suggestions pop up
basically the internet or YouTube is
trying to guess what you're about to
type based on what other people in the
past have searched for
so you've got monkeys jumping on the bed
monkey eating a banana monkey on the car
monkey throws poop at Grandma I like
that one
there you go alright so go ahead and
click on the first one and now we can
watch a video of a monkey throwing poop
at grandma not not my grandma mother
grandma horse but there ej he just threw
the poop oh no it's another graham and
then there there's a guy laughing at her
that's rude that was uh you just watched
you those are twenty seconds you can
never get back but uh welcome to the
Internet what's this what's a song to
you that you enjoy Reese
Elvis okay so why don't we do that why
don't we go ahead and click in the
search bar right here yep yeah getting
the hang of it okay now I've got my
little mini speaker connected so go
ahead and hit the play button a little
uh the little triangle so do you know
this song yeah you do okay now you can
listen to the song and you can actually
watch this any time and you can watch it
as many times as you want there's
probably a 10-hour version of it
somewhere so yeah I mean this is this is
pretty much what YouTube's good for
watching it's for entertainment a lot of
the time or or education as well kind of
like what I do so before I get flagged
for copyright infringement let's go
ahead and pause this okay grandpa I
think we've learned a lot today and this
is probably a lot to take in for you but
you did really good honestly I think
you're going to be a computer whiz in no
time so before we close out the video I
want to quickly just show you how to
shut the system down or how to turn the
computer off the best way to do that
first of all is grab the mouse and to
close this window to close the internet
you want to highlight the big X that's
in the in the very far top right corner
and then you want to go to the very
bottom left corner where you see that
little white
square go ahead and click that beautiful
you'll see that it says power right
there so you want to click where it says
power because you actually want to power
the computer down so click that there
you go and you should see an option for
shutdown I might have to enlarge the
text for you because it's a little bit
tiny I didn't really take that into
consideration we are using a 1080p
monitor so I felt the scaling wouldn't
be quite as awful if we were doing
something like 4k but after you click
shut down you'll see that your monitor
and your computer will turn off you
don't have to print about huh nope in
fact it's generally a better idea to use
the mouse in order to shut everything
down through the software so I think we
have learned quite a bit today we've
covered a lot of ground and you did
really well
you were absolutely fantastic I'm pretty
sure that you're going to be a computer
whiz in no time but what did you think
about your first computer experience
today I think I like it you like it yeah
but which which part that I showed you
today did you like the most cool
you liked YouTube yeah YouTube UT was
pretty awesome it's got that visual
element and there's definitely a lot
that can be seen I mean you mail cool
and unseen the email too is very useful
I think you're gonna you're gonna really
enjoy that once you start messaging your
friends back and forth but on that notes
grandpa thank you so much again for
being a part of this little video I
really do appreciate it put in and
hopefully you enjoy your new computer
from here on out so maybe we'll do
another lesson maybe we'll do a lesson
too if there's enough demand for it I
don't know leave your guys's feedback in
the comments below and be sure to toss
me a like on the video if you enjoyed it
and congratulate my grandpa for his
first PC endeavor
welcome to the PC master-race grandpa it
is a beautiful community that I'm sure
you're going to fit in just fine but
