awesomesauce news today I'll be taking a
look at lamb Tron's FC 5v to fan
controller as you can see from the front
of the box does have four separate
channels they are dial knobs and it does
feature an LCD screen at the front and
you can see that screen actually comes
in seven different colors so this is a
pretty fancy controller it's definitely
not skimpy by any means and you can see
down here there are 30 watts of delivery
per channel so even if you have two fans
that are you know maybe take 12 watts
each you could actually hook two of
those up to one of these channels and it
would work perfectly fine so it's not
much else on the box oh yeah it does
come in two flavors you've got a silver
kind of a silver metallic look right
there and then you've got an anodized
black or yeah I think that's right but
the one I'm taking a look at today is
the black one so when I pop this guy
open and first thing is the user's
manual I won't get too much into that I
am the manual guys you don't need that
thing
here's some temperature leads so you can
actually hook up up to four temperature
leads one per channel and you would
place these yellow ends but various
places in your case and you connect the
other to the other end which is these
are these two pin connectors to your fan
controller and from there you can
actually monitor the temperatures of
various spaces within your chassis
they've also included some fan extension
cables so you can see they are nicely
sleeved black sleeved cables very nice
touch it's got some heat-shrink on the
ends there and then you can see you've
got some three pin extension connectors
right there it's very nice and you've
got a molex power connector of course
your bollocks it's going to be what's
powering this entire controller and thus
what is powering all the fans or other
peripherals that are connected to it and
finally Oh almost forgot these you've
got some mounting screws by the way guys
this fan controller does fit in one of
your five and a quarter inch bays only
takes up a single bay and if this then
will focus and other screws pretty sure
most you know what screws look like and
then here we've got a little jumper
little tiny mini jumper and I'm going to
show you what that is in just a second
here's the main event this is the fan
controller itself forgive the train horn
passing by but here it is got a lamp
Tron FC five little logo up there and
it's got a nice brushed aluminum design
at the front
it actually looks very sleek does this
does not look cheap at all looks very
high-end it'll look really nice in
certain cases if I'm you know I'm going
to tell you right now this isn't going
to look great in any case out there
you're going to want one with a very
sleek maybe a more modern minimalistic
design this thing would pop right in
there but you know it's all preference
people who might a judge but also forgot
to say there's the LCD LCD screen
obviously let me take this little guy
off whoa
that looks much better doesn't it very
nice alright so the real stuff is
happening back here first off you got
your molex power connector your four pin
that's 12 volt and then you can up top
it's kind of confusing with the PCB up
here there's so many little wires and
stuff but you can see you've got four
one two three and four three pin fan
connectors right there one per channel
and a pretty pretty self-explanatory you
plug in your fans right there and down
here is where it gets interesting so you
can see there there are four pins kind
of hard to see because they have these
mini jumpers on when we take the jumpers
off oh I just took off all three at once
skills there you go you've got six pins
and just beneath them are labeled B G
and R or more commonly known as the
acronym RGB and yes those do stand for
blue green and red so that's essentially
how you control or change the color of
your LCD output is with these little
jumpers well plastic jumpers that I
showed you I just took off so
essentially if you wanted blue you would
put a jumper on the two pins that are
labeled blue or B if you want green you
put it on the G you want are put it on
the are but get this if you want purple
you put one jumper on the B and then one
jumper on the are just like that and
just like wise you can do yellow with a
G and our that right yeah I mean see
this is this all goes back to those
Barney days when it's
when you mix blue and red you get purple
you know you're like I'm never going to
use that information but BAM here it is
so pay attention to your Barney kids so
they're basically you have it there are
seven colors I'm going to show those to
you in just a second so I'm not going to
go through all the different
combinations just yet
but over here are more leads you can see
it says select all right you got four
pins now two jumpers one on each and
you've got C and F just above those so
the Seas for Celsius f is for Fahrenheit
basically it's the temperature readout
there'll be a temperature readout of
your temp leads right and so you can
either have them display in either
Celsius or Fahrenheit so if you want
Celsius you just have Celsius on there
just like that and if you want a
Fahrenheit you'd have the Fahrenheit
jumper on but get this guys if you have
both jumpers on like I just did or if
you remove both of them then essentially
you switch to voltage mode so instead of
your LCD reading out the temperatures
let's say you don't want any temperature
leads in your computer or you just don't
care about the temps in those areas
it'll actually revert to voltage mode
and from there you can actually see how
much voltage you're putting out to each
channel so as you turn the knob in
theory you'll see the voltage meter go
up it's very useful but essentially the
next to that is the alarm come on focus
there we go there's the alarm so if you
have a lead on there it'll basically
enable your alarm so if any of your
temperature leads ever goes above 70
degrees Celsius you'll hear a little
beeping noise it'll be like hey it's
getting hot in here and then you should
probably tend to your computer in case
it's on fire or if you don't want the
alarm at all you simply just leave the
jumper off and it will disable that
alarm eight pins up here see that
they're all labeled J s one two three
and four that's where your temperature
leads go so those two pin connectors I
showed you on one end they plug into
each of those and that way you can
monitor the temperatures of course so
that's pretty much it
I hear the mounting points in your five
and quarter-inch Bay so why don't I get
this guy all situated I'm going to
install it well I'm not gonna install
I'm just going to power it up maybe
connect a fan or two to it and we can
take a look at what this LCD screen
looks
like when it's turned on alright guys so
I have the fan controller all hooked up
now it's currently running off of a
fractal Newton r3 600 watt modular power
supply I basically just had to jump it
in order to get things started
here you can see I've got a fan
connected right here and right now I'm
in voltage mode so the voltage is being
displayed on the lower row while the RPM
for the fans are on the top row so right
now I don't know if you can tell but if
I crank this up you'll see the voltage
start to go up and of course our PM will
go up as well if I do it I can't really
tell it's actually connected to a net
this first channel is connected to an
led fan so of course it will also
control the LED because they're both
wired to the same connection but there
you have it and then this channel is a
little bit different though I actually
took a three pin Y splitter so I
actually have two fans connected to this
there are two Corsair fans and if I
crank it up you can definitely tell
there's two fans because they're just
super loud takes a little while but also
you can see that the RPM readout is in
increments of 10 but those seem to be
fairly accurate oh man that feels really
nice nice cool breeze
I'm turning it down so I can hear myself
think and no fan is connected to this
one that's why there's zero rpm and zero
voltage but on the fourth channel we
have a voltage here 4.8 volts but
there's no rpm and you're wondering why
why Kyle why is that well that's because
I don't actually have it hooked up to a
fan I have that fourth channel is
connected to this BitFenix alchemy LED
strip and essentially I just wanted to
demonstrate that you can also use this
fan controller and many fan controllers
for that matter to adjust your LED
accents in your case so you can see here
if I crank the dial up oh you can see
the light and of course you can go full
blast as bright as it can be oh so I
thought this was kind of cool
kind of neat to show off I just wanted
to demonstrate that there you guys have
it let's show you guys some of the
different colors of the LCD screen as I
Pro
most oh wait no I'm forgetting something
I wanted to show you guys like the the
temperature temperature mode so I'm
going to plug in some leads really quick
and I'll be right back
alright guys so I just plugged in two of
the temperature leads and I had to
remove one of those mini jumpers if you
remember had to remove one or the other
in order to get from voltage mode to
either Celsius or Fahrenheit mode as you
can see here we've got a readout in
degrees Celsius the voltage has gone
away and there you have your
temperatures for the two leads leads are
pretty much in the exact same spot right
now they're underneath my desk
seems pretty chilly down there but with
that said why don't we take a look at
some of the cool colors that this LCD
can display
alright guys that is going to do it for
this unboxing and overview once again
