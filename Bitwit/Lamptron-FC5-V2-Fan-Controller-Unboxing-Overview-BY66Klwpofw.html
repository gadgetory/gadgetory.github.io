awesomesauce news today I'll be taking a
look at lamb Tron's FC 5v2 fan
controller and as you can see from the
front of the box does have four separate
channels they are dial knobs and it does
feature an LCD screen at the front and
you can see that screen actually comes
in seven different colors so this is a
pretty fancy controller it's definitely
not skimpy by any means and you can see
down here there are 30 watts of delivery
per channel so even if you have two fans
that are you know maybe take 12 watts
each you could actually hook two of
those up to one of these channels and it
would work perfectly fine so uh it's not
much else on the box oh yeah it does
come in two flavors you've got a silver
kind of a silver metallic look right
there and then you've got an anodized
black her yeah I think that's right but
the one I'm taking a look at today is
the black one so when I pop this guy
open and first thing is the user's
manual I won't get too much into that
I am the manual gasps you don't need
that thing here's some temperature leads
so you can actually hook up up to four
temperature leads one per channel and
you would place these yellow ends at
various places in your case and you
connect the other to the other end which
is these are these two pin connectors to
your fan controller and from there you
can actually monitor the temperatures of
various spaces within your chassis
they've also included some fan extension
cables so you can see they are nicely
sleeved black sleeved cables very nice
touch it's got some heat shrink on the
ends there and there you can see you've
got some three pin extension connectors
right there it's very nice and you've
got a molex power connector of course
your molex it's going to be what's
powering this entire controller and thus
what is powering all the fans or other
peripherals that are connected to it and
finally Oh almost forgot these you've
got some mounting screws by the way guys
this fan controller does fit in one of
your five and a quarter inch bays only
takes up a single bay and if this then
will focus and other screws pretty sure
most do you know what screws look like
and then here we've got a little jumper
little tiny mini jumper and I'm going to
show you what that is in just a second
but
here's the main events this is the fan
controller itself forgive the train horn
passing by but here it is got a lamp
Tron FC five little logo up there and
it's got a nice brushed aluminum design
at the front it actually looks very
sleek just this does not look cheap at
all looks very high-end it'll look
really nice in certain cases if I'm you
know I'm gonna tell you right now this
isn't gonna look great in any case out
there now you're gonna want one that
with a very sleek maybe a more modern
minimalistic design this thing would pop
right in there but you know it's all
preference people Who am I to judge but
I'll also forget to say there's the LCD
LCD screen obviously let me take this
little guy off oh that looks much better
doesn't it very nice all right so the
real stuff is happening back here first
off you got your molex power connector
your four pin that's 12 volt and then
you can up top it's kind of confusing
with the PCB up here there's so many
little wires and stuff but you can see
you've got four one two three and four
three pin fan connectors right there one
per channel and pretty pretty
self-explanatory you plug in your fans
right there and down here is where it
gets interesting so you can see there
there are four pins kind of hard to see
because they have these mini jumpers on
when we take the jumpers off oh I just
took off all three at once skills there
you go you've got six pins and just
beneath them are labeled B G and R or
more commonly known as the acronym RGB
and yes those do stand for blue green
and red so that's essentially how you
control or change the color of your LCD
output is with these little jumpers
little plastic jumpers that I showed you
I just took off so essentially if you
wanted blue you would put a jumper on
the two pins that are labeled blue or B
if you want green you put it on the G
you want are put it on the R but get
this if you want purple you put one
jumper on the B and then one jumper on
the are just like that and just like
wise you can do yellow with G and R is
that right yeah I mean see this is this
all goes back to those Barney days when
it's
when you mix blue and red you get purple
and you know you're like I'm never gonna
use that information but BAM here it is
so pay attention to your Barney kids so
they're basically you have it there are
seven colors I'm going to show those to
you in just a second so I'm not going to
go through all the different
combinations just yet but over here are
more leads you can see it says select
all right you got four pins now two
jumpers one on each and you've got C and
F just above those so the Seas for
Celsius f is for Fahrenheit basically
it's the temperature readout there'll be
a temperature readout of your temp leads
right and so you can either have them
display in either Celsius or Fahrenheit
so if you want Celsius
you just have Celsius on there just like
that and if you want a Fahrenheit you'd
have the Fahrenheit jumper on but get
this guys if you have both jumpers on
like I just did or if you remove both of
them then essentially you switch to
voltage mode so instead of your LCD
reading out the temperatures let's say
you don't want any temperature leads in
your computer or you just don't care
about the temps in those areas
it'll actually revert to voltage mode
and from there you can actually see how
much voltage you're putting out to each
channel so as you turn the knob in
theory you'll see the voltage meter go
up that's very useful but essentially
the next to that is the alarm come on
okay there we go there's the alarm so if
you have a lead on there it'll basically
enable your alarm so if any of your
temperature leads ever goes above 70
degrees Celsius you'll hear a little
beeping noise it'll be like hey it's
getting hot in here and then you should
probably tend to your computer in case
it's on fire or if you don't want the
alarm at all you simply just leave the
jumper off and it will disable that
alarm eight pins up here see that
they're all labeled J s one two three
and four
that's where your temperature leads go
so those two pin connectors I showed you
on one end they plug into each of those
and that way you can monitor the
temperatures of course so uh that's
pretty much it
here the mounting points in your five
and quarter-inch Bay so why don't I get
this guy all situated I'm gonna install
it well I'm not gonna install I'm just
gonna power it up maybe connect a fan or
two to it and we can take a look at what
this L
TV screen looks like when it's turned on
alright guys so I have the fan
controller all hooked up now it's
currently running off of a fractal
Newton r3 600 watt modular power supply
I basically just had to jump it in order
to get things started but here you can
see I've got a fan connected right here
and right now I'm in voltage mode so the
voltage is being displayed on the lower
row while the RPM for the fans are on
the top row so right now I don't know if
you can tell but if I crank this up
you'll see the voltage start to go up
and of course our PM will go up as well
if I do it I can't really tell it's
actually connected to a net this first
channel is connected to an LED fan so of
course it'll also control the LED
because they're both wired to the same
connection but there you have it and
then this channel is a little bit
different though I actually took a three
pin Y splitter so I actually have two
fans connected to this there are two
Corsair fans and if I crank it up you
can definitely tell there's two fans
because we're just super loud takes a
little while but also you can see that
the RPM readout is in increments of 10
but those seem to be fairly accurate oh
man that feels really nice nice cool
breeze and turn that down so I can hear
myself think and no fan is connected to
this one that's why there's zero rpm and
zero voltage but on the fourth channel
we have a voltage here 4.8 volts but
there's no rpm and you're wondering why
why Kyle why is that well that's because
I don't actually have it hooked up to a
fan I have that fourth channel is
connected to this BitFenix alchemy LED
strip and essentially I just wanted to
demonstrate that you can also use this
fan controller and many fan controllers
for that matter to adjust your LED
accents in your case so you can see here
if I crank the dial up oh you can see
the light and of course you can go full
blast as bright as it can be ooh
so I thought this is kind of cool kind
of neat to show off I just wanted to
demonstrate that there you guys have it
let's show you guys some of the
different colors of the
seedy screen as I promised oh wait no
I'm forgetting something I wanted to
show you guys like the the temperature
temperature mode so I'm gonna plug in
some leads really quick and I'll be
right back alright guys so I just
plugged in two of the temperature leads
and I had to remove one of those mini
jumpers if you remember you had to
remove one or the other in order to get
from voltage mode to either Celsius or
Fahrenheit mode and as you can see here
we've got a readout in degrees Celsius
the voltage has gone away and there you
have your temperatures for the two leads
leads are pretty much in the exact same
spot right now
they're underneath my desk seems pretty
chilly down there but with that said why
don't we take a look at some of the cool
colors that this LCD can display
alright guys that is gonna do it for
this unboxing and overview once again
this has been Lam Tron's FC 5v2 fan
controller I'm Kyle with awesomesauce
