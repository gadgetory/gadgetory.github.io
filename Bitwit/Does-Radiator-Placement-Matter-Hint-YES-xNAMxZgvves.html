channel today we're taking a look at
radiators specifically those found on
liquid cooled a i/os for your CPU and
the best place to mount them in your
case whether that be at the top as an
exhaust or at the front of your case as
an intake those are the two main schools
of thoughts are the two main methods on
where to put your radiator in the
majority of modern-day mid-tower chassis
so there are pros and cons to both and
today we're actually going to test both
options to see which one reigns supreme
now the great thing about having your
radiator mounted at the top of your case
as an exhaust is that you're exhausting
all the hot air from within your case
outside of it so it's actually going to
be good for the rest of your internal
components because you're ejecting all
that hot air far away from them however
you're also taking all that hot air and
you're permeating your fin stack in that
radiator with it so that could
potentially be hazardous for your cpu
temps when you actually have things like
your GPU generating lots of heat under
load and that that that warm air gets
circulated inside your case and then
pass through that thin array that could
potentially lead to higher CPU
temperatures we're going to find out
whether or not it makes a difference
today on the other side of the argument
if you have a front mounted radiator set
to intake you're pulling a lot of cool
fresh air from your ambient surrounding
environment which is generally cooler
than the warm air circulating inside of
your case so that's good for CPU
temperatures at the same time once that
cool fresh air permeates the fin stack
it carries away all the heat that was
absorbed in that array and it basically
ejects it inside of your case and they
are getting potentially warmer
components apart from your CPU such as
your your graphics card which in most
mid-tower chassis these days is mounted
right in front of where a front mounted
radiator would be so is this going to
pose a problem for your GPU temperatures
we're going to find all that out today
and as you can already probably tell
there's an additional layer of
consideration here when it comes to your
graphics card are we are we talking
about an open-air shroud or an enclosed
blower style card because that could
also play a difference or play a role on
how your CPU temperatures are affected
whether it's the radiators mounted at
the top or front your case so we're
actually will be analyzing four
different scenarios today top mounted
radiator with an open-air shroud as well
as a blow of style card and frontmen
with both both of those same two video
card options and the school of thought
behind video card being an open-air
Shroud is that it's going to be ejecting
and circulating a lot of that hot air
that's being dissipated from the GPU
into your case so if you were to have a
top mounted radiator and an open-air
shroud is that going to pose an issue
for your CPU now because you're
generating more heat inside of your
chassis that's going to now be funneled
through that radiator at the top of your
case conversely if you're dealing with a
blower style card you don't have to
worry so much about hot air being spewed
out from your GPU into your case because
all that hot air is being ejected out
the back that's just how blower style
cards are designed for the most part at
the same time you generally get higher
temperatures on your GPU with a design
of that style because you don't have as
many exit points for hot air to just be
dissipated all around it it's more
considered it takes one for the team so
to speak for your other internal
components by harboring all of the hot
air to itself and having a smaller exit
window to eject it out of so we're going
to be taking a look at those four
scenarios today to see which one is the
most optimal what you should be looking
out for if it really makes any
difference at all and at the end of the
day which solution works best for your
needs so I already have all the hardware
set up here I guess we'll just go over
everything
so as far as the processor we're using
we've got the core i7 7700 K so we are
dealing with the KB Lake Architecture
the latest seventh generation core
processors from Intel that will be
overclocked quite heavily to 5 gigahertz
and I wanted to really dial in an
aggressive overclock for this test
because I feel like if we were to run
everything at moderate to low speeds we
wouldn't see as much variable difference
between our thermals from test to test
so to really get an idea of how fingers
are being affected I wanted to crank up
the speeds quite a bit so 5 gigahertz is
where we're at I believe at one point
for something volts don't quote me it's
a little bit over 1.4 but it is running
stable of instability tests and all that
so that's going to be cooled by the
corsair h 100 GTX v2 which is a 240
millimeter radiator attached to that
units we're also going to be using the
stock fans that came with that liquid
cooled i/o which are 120 millimeter fans
of course plugged directly into the
wires coming off of the water block
those are three pin connectors there's
no fancy fan curve that we're setting up
here it's just going to be running at
the default balanced rpm
seeds that come right out of the box
additionally for our motherboard we've
got the msi Zi 270 gaming Pro carbon and
that's going to be paired with 16 gigs
of Corsair Vengeance lpx memory at 3000
megahertz we've also got two gtx 1070 s
that will be tested separately of course
the first of which is the zotac amp
Edition which is going to represent our
open air shroud and then we've got the
founders of from Nvidia representing our
blower style card both of these cards
will be running with a 100 mega Hertz
offset on the core clock as well as a
350 megahertz offset on the memory clock
as well as power and temperature sliders
maxed 211 to take full advantage of GPU
boost 3.0 some to bear in mind however
is that the zotac amp Edition card does
come factory overclocked so we'll be
running slightly faster than the
founders Edition but any kind of big
thermal difference that we see between
these two cards under load is most
likely going to be due to the cooler
design and Rainier orientation as
opposed to running at slightly different
frequencies so bear that in mind
additionally we've also got a power
supply in here a fractal design Integra
650 watt units and a 240 gig SanDisk
Ultra 2 SSD which is going to have our
operating system Windows 10 64 bits and
all of our applications loaded up on
there last but not least we've got our
case that we're rocking the case is very
important here it's probably going to be
one of the biggest differential factors
if you guys were to test this at home
you might get completely different
results than I am today based on the
hardware you're using particularly your
chassis and how good the air flow is
within that so we've got the define as
from fractal design we are using some
aftermarket fans here noting the stock
ones that came with the unit so we've
got a rear exhaust 140 millimeter
fractal design venturi fan that is the
case fan not the static pressure one
that's going to be again our rear
exhaust and we've got two NZXT case fans
that came off of the Manta either the
Manta or the s3 40mm but they might
actually be the exact same model fans
but we've got two of those which are
going to their positions are going to
vary based on where the radiator is so
when our test where the radiators at the
top of the case those two fans are going
to be mounted at the front did I say
there were 120 there 120 millimeter fans
if I didn't mention that they're going
to be mad at the front of the case when
the radiators on top and they're going
to be mounted at the top of the case
when the radiators at the front hope
that makes sense and that's also going
to play a huge role if you
we have if you have zero or one case van
in your setup and everything else is
identical here you might see drastically
different results so bear that in mind
this is a very specific use case
scenario but I did try my best to pick
some components that reflect a
modern-day high-end mid tower that is
going to be primed for overclocking
which hopefully is somewhat
representative of some of you out there
so I think on that note ladies and
gentleman we're ready to fire up some
tests with image in heaven 4.0 back here
we're gonna be doing 30 minute runs so
all four of the scenarios that we're
testing are going to get 30 minutes a
piece under load in this particular
application we're going to go ahead and
circle back with the results and we're
going to see once and for all how the
temperatures both on our CPU and or GPU
might be affected by radiator
orientation as well as the type of video
card shroud that we'll be using in this
chassis should be interesting don't go
anywhere we'll be right back
I'll be right back I'm alone I'm always
alone all right shell so we have run the
tests and I have the results here and
very very telling numbers actually um
you guys are going to find this very
interesting so we're going to start off
with the top mounted radiator tests
first so both of those with the blower
style fan and the open air shroud and
see how those compared so with the top
mounted radiator set to exhaust our
blower style card saw CPU temperatures
all the way up to 77 degrees Celsius on
the package and our GPU God is hot as
any 3 degrees Celsius now 83 degrees C
on an overclocked founder's Edition gtx
1070 is perfectly normal especially
since we crank the temperature slider
all the way up with an msi afterburner
so that's not too big of a concern 77
degrees Celsius on the package of our
CPU is pretty warm I mean granted we are
overclocked pretty heavily to 5
gigahertz but I wouldn't want to see any
temperatures go beyond that so let's see
how we fared with an open-air shroud
with our ZOTAC card also overclocked
with the same top mounted radiator
configuration 86 degrees Celsius on our
CPU we went up what what is that nine
nine degree Celsius just from going from
a blower style card to an open-air
shroud our CPU rose nine degrees Celsius
just because we changed the type of
video card shroud we were using with a
top mounted radiator in the mix our GPU
of course with a ZOTAC
to market a danboard partner cooler is
going to be a lot cooler than founder
position which is expected so we had 71
degrees Celsius on that on the GPU which
is going to allow us to hit higher boost
clock frequencies as well so that's good
so a great first our GPU not so hot or
actually very hot in a bad way for our
CPU
nothing's get really interesting when we
switch to the front mounted radiator so
with the blower style card and front
radiator we saw a CPU temperature of 76
degree Celsius on the package and a GPU
temp of 84 degrees C now that's not the
interesting part because that's pretty
much exactly what we saw almost
identical to what we saw with a top
mounted radiator and that same blower
card so we went from 77 to 76 on the
package so we went down a degree for CPU
which makes sense if we're going to be
dealing with a front mounted radiator
this time pulling fresh air again from
the outside ambient environment and then
one degree higher on our GPU which also
makes sense because now we've got
slightly warmer air coming in after it
permeates that CPU radiator that's
that's headed straight for our graphics
card so overall there's a little bit of
a change on both sides but not huge not
it's not it's not that very marginal it
could be subject to a margin of error as
well so nothing too big to fret on that
end however this is where it gets crazy
is when we switch to an open air shroud
on our video card like the zotac amp
Edition and we have a front mounted
radiator again 76 degrees Celsius on the
CPU package so remember with with an
open air shroud on when it was a top
mounted radiator using the same video
card we were at 86 degrees C on the CPU
package so we just dropped 10 degrees on
our on our overclocked 7700 K by simply
switching the radiator from top to front
that is huge that is completely massive
that's the only thing that we changed on
the GPU front we got 71 degree Celsius
which is pretty much staying in in tune
and consistent with what the zotac amp
card has been delivering throughout
today's testing so that's nice to see
and you can see there that that actually
brings up another huge point the
graphics card is hardly affected
actually whether it's blower or open air
it's hardly affected it does not care
where the radiator is it might go up a
degree or down a degree but for the most
part your CPU temperatures your CPU is
not going to be emitting nearly as much
heat inside your case as the video
card is if you're dealing with an
open-air shroud that's why the CPU went
up ten degrees as soon as we had the
radiate the top radiator ingesting all
the hot air through its through its pin
stack so that's really interesting if
you guys are rocking a open air shroud
on your video card which these days most
of us are and you have a liquid-cooled
AIO for your CPU inside of your case if
you have the option to mount it to the
front I would very much do so and I'd be
curious to hear what your guys's results
are if you were to test it yourselves at
home have your met your radiator mounted
at the front do some do a half hour of
image in heaven there and then have it
at the top and do another half hour and
just compare the CPU temperatures to see
if you're getting consistent results
with what I am because that would be
very very very enlightening and very
insightful not enlightening be
insightful I'm using the wrong words now
but at the end of the day there you guys
have it
I already sort of anticipated that the
CPU temperatures would be higher with an
open-air shroud if we were to mount the
radiator at the top of the case but I
did not foresee it being a 10 degree
difference simply from moving the
radiator from one position to another so
that's very interesting I thought this
was a fascinating test despite my
hypothesis already being correct it just
kind of took it to the extreme and went
a bit further than that blew my
expectations out of the water but let me
know what you guys think which which
orientation you have your radiators
mounted in your chassis assuming you
have liquid cooled AOS on those CPUs of
yours and if it seems to make much of a
difference whether it's mounted to the
top or the front or you know if you're
going to be doing any further testing
feel free to also share your results in
the comments so that we can all see it
but that's pretty much going to do it
for this little test guys let me know
what you thought in the comments below

enjoyed this type of experimental
content and that is pretty much we want
to do it for now thank you all so much
