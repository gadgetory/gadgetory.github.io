2016 is brought to you by need for seat
go to need for seat USA comm for the
ultimate gaming chair experience for
your desk in office and Corsair they
make good products and you should buy
them alright guys so right now I am
taking a look at some really cool
technology from a company called Tobi
they've integrated it into this MSI
laptop what you're essentially seeing on
screen is Assassin's Creed syndicate I
believe that's the name of the game very
popular you might see this little bubble
that's moving around the screen what
that essentially is it's it's actually
where I'm looking on the screen right
now in real time and it does this by
calibrating my eyes and where they are
positioned on the screen and that
actually helps you in game do some
really cool things for example you climb
around and you jump in scale buildings
in this game so I can actually jump to
any one of these little pillars here and
you can see how I'm selecting them but
I'm not moving the joystick at all I'm
merely looking at each of these pillars
that I might consider jumping to and
once I find find one that I like I can
go ahead and hit that button and I'm on
my way well actually yeah I'm on my way
Tobi is working with certain developers
to incorporate this technology into
their game so it's not going to just
fire up with any old game but as long as
the technology development support is
there between the two companies you can
start to see just a completely new
dimension of playing games and okay so
right now I'm being chased by these
these little crooks and as I'm running
away I can look at them literally and
just press the the trigger button on the
controller which is why and I just shot
him right there but I targeted them
completely using my eyes only which is a
pretty interesting it's a really cool
experience
granted I'm bad at aiming on with a
joystick and I'm pretty bad at aiming
with my eyes even but it is actually a
quite a bit easier to get him here I
think I am out of bullets I need to
reload Oh No
I'm out of bullets okay so the
technology will not help you if you're
out of bullets another thing I want to
point out is that this this this
technology uses a built-in camera which
is down here kind of hard to see and
three infrared sensors essentially that
kind of track where your eye movement
goes at all times and also as for the
little bubble that you see on-screen
that's more so just in reference for you
guys so you
can kind of see how this demo works but
in reality when this is actually put to
market you're not going to see that
bubble so if you guys heard that but
pretty much as I'm driving this cart the
the camera will automatically pan
wherever my eyes move and you'll also
notice that when I'm looking in darker
areas of the environment they actually
start to lighten up
so I can see them better just like your
eyes would dilate in real life so adds
this completely new dimension to the
game which is kind of hard to describe
but very cool before I go I want to give
a huge shout out to both of my sponsors
