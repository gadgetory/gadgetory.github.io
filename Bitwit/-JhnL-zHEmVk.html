what's up guys so over Black Friday and
Cyber Monday weekend I gave myself the
challenge of building the best gaming PC
I could possibly afford with the high
end budget of $400 being played in a
Palma just won me one bad now searching
for the best deals from online stores
like Amazon and Newegg I was able to
piece together a rather formidable
system for around the price of a gaming
console of course we can officially dub
this a certified console killer until we
see some benchmarks so let's dive right
in with a closer look at the discounted
parts that I snagged for this budget
holiday system for our CPU I picked up
an FX 4350 from AMD for 84 bucks a
quad-core processor at minimum was a
must-have on my end as we start to see
more games utilizing multiple cores
clocked at 4.2 gigahertz this is still a
great bang for the buck CPU that's a
decent overclocker as well those
sticking with the included stock cooler
to stay within budget means we'll have
to hold off tweaking until a future
upgrade in the cooling department given
our CPU of choice I searched high and
low for a cheap am-3 + motherboard that
still had some nice features in the end
I wound up grabbing this gigabyte 7/8
LMT USB 3 a micro ATX board supporting
the 760 G chipset that was on sale for
just 50 bucks
front and rear USB 3 heatsink on the V
RMS and a neutral color scheme make this
an alluring option for the price
compared to the CPU and motherboard
there's really not much to choosing
memory these days find some compatible
sticks with the speed and capacity you
need that's from a brand you trust and
the hardware takes care of the rest I
opted for this 2 by 4 gig kit of g.skill
ripjaws X at 1600 for the discounted
price of just 30 bucks to handle the
bulk of our gaming needs we have the
Radeon HD 7950 from sapphire the card
packs a 3 gig frame buffer and later
went on to be rebranded as an r 90 to 80
which is still a great card for casual
gaming cyber monday discounts and being
a refurbished item scored B this part
for just 140 dollars making
one of my best finds over the weekend
for storage I picked up this 500 gig
Seagate Barracuda for a single Jackson
with a 400 ollar budget I had to make
the decision between a higher capacity
mechanical drive or an SSD with far less
storage with game sizes getting
increasingly bigger I opted for capacity
over speed this time around
although dropping in an SSD at a later
date would probably be the first upgrade
I'd recommend making to this system well
I'm sure many of you are tired of seeing
this power supply reappear in numerous
budget builds on the interwebs the CX
430 from Corsair remains one of the
cheapest PS use with an 80 plus bronze
certification this unit only sent me
back 43 bucks however I will be
returning it to Newegg tomorrow because
I just realized that I already have one
Oh bless you all for staying subscribe
to me I'll never know why finally we'll
be building in the core 1000 from
fractal design which I caught on sale
for just $30 if my last two desktops are
any indication I've developed an
affinity for the brands define line of
chassis x' over the years unfortunately
their level of quality trickles down to
fractals budget cases as well the core
1000 features front panel USB 3 a
straightforward internal layout and the
company's trademark minimalistic design
which looks volumes better than most
other cases at this price point when
compared to the MSRP I saved a combined
total of 150 dollars on all the parts
for this build bringing the final cost
adjust within my $400 budget taking a
quick look at the benchmarks I tested
out for triple-a titles at 1080 using
high settings across the board with MSA
a disabled to our delights the system
topped 40 FPS on average in every game
even topping 50 and 60 FPS in GTA 5 in
battlefield 4 respectively evidently
picking up a three gig video card was a
wise choice as well as our vram did max
out at 2.4 gigabytes
under load given the results I think
it's safe to call this capable little
machine a legitimate console killer
perhaps the only leg up a console might
have here is the acoustic since the
stock CPU cooler here sounds like a
possessed blender while gaming naturally
setbacks like these arise when you're on
a super tight budget hypothetically
speaking if this were my personal rig
the next few upgrades I'd make as I
mentioned before would be an SSD for my
OS and programs as well as a more
effective and quiet CPU cooler and
finally an 80 millimeter exhaust fan to
aid in case air
I think those small improvements would
go a long way for the system and while
that's definitely the direction I would
have gone today had this been a $500 PC
I suppose leaving some room for upgrades
is all part of the fun but that's going
to do for now guys before you go don't
forget toss me a like on this video if
