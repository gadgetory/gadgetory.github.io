2015 is brought to you by WD how's it
going guys welcome back to awesomesauce
Network we are continuing our coverage
here of CES 2015 we've made our way to
the venetian suites where there are a
lot of off-site vendors here
demonstrating some amazing products that
were going to check out today I don't
even care anymore I really don't even
care
alright guys about the AMD booth right
now I'm talking to Omar now we've got a
pretty sweet laptop here I know it's
alienware and a lot of my fans out there
like Oh alienware they're run by dell
and and boo you know right and like yeah
okay sometimes they can be expensive and
whatnot but this is just kind of a
unique in its own right regardless of
the manufacturer that we're talking
about can you explain a little bit
what's going on here sure this is the
alien 15 laptop it's actually powered by
our radeon mobility class discrete
graphics and what's unique about this
laptop is that you can buy this external
graphics amplifier which you can put a
discrete desktop-class graphics in it so
this one actually has an hour 929 DX
graphics card and it's powering the 4k
external panel and it's using a wired
connection a proprietary wired
connection made by alienware and what
this allows you is if you're a person
who likes LAN parties this is a perfect
choice you don't really have to have a
desktop to lug around you can just take
a laptop and you can just take this
little graphics amplifier with you
anywhere what why do you think dell even
bothers making anything else there's you
know different markets for different you
don't have to answer that no thanks for
talking to us and enjoy the rest of your
time here at sea yes alright so we just
made our way to the microsoft booth but
apparently it's not really a booth it's
just a bunch of private meeting rooms
where executives and stuff for meeting
so i'm not gonna be able to get the
latest scoop on Windows 10 but
apparently windows 9 was so bad they had
to skip over completely so at this point
I think we're just gonna head over back
to the show floor and check out the
booth there let's go
alright guys so I'm here at the creative
booth now we're in the south hall and
came across this little guy it's got a
bunch of CES Innovation Awards around it
it's actually a deck it's a
digital-to-analog converter for your
headphones or speakers it's called the
sound blaster x 7 it actually has some
pretty impressive numbers here 127
decibel deck has a 100 watt amp and it
can power or drive headphones up to 600
ohms of impedance so you guys have
really high quality headphones you're
you know rocking something that's far
beyond 50 ohms this can drive those no
problem so definitely worth checking out
if you're at a really high quality audio
alright so i'm at the Samsung booth now
guys checking out their new Galaxy Note
edge and you can see that there's no
dock right here like that usually is
because it's all been moved to the side
and actually the screen the right side
of the screen more or less is curved but
only the right side of the screen so
this might be a little awkward for
left-handed users or if you just like to
hold your phone in the left hand over
your right because it's only curved on
that one side but it's pretty cool these
are all your frequently used
applications and you can swipe to the
left or right it also does things like
music you can play music yeah pretty
cool feature is let's say you have an
app open you can swipe to the left and
it brings up your all of your it brings
up the edge screen if you will this is
really nice because you guys are Android
users you know that you have to click
the button usually to get back to your
docs if you want to open up one of those
but this just makes it really intuitive
so pretty cool stuff
alright so i have a stumbled across
suitable technologies and this is pretty
crazy I'm actually talking to a real
person right now this is reem she's one
of the product specialists reem how you
doing today I'm doing great thank you
just rolling around hanging out on beam
living the dream that sounds awesome not
when I walked by I thought all of you
guys were recordings but you're actually
you're where are you right now I'm ready
you in Vegas come on Kyle I know it
really feels that way it's it's really I
guess that's the point right no I'm
actually in the flesh of in palo alto
california but i'm also hanging out in
vegas so what kind of application does
this product have and you know for real
world consumers great question so
originally when we first had this
product is made for remote workers it
was a way for them to feel more a part
of their should I say their headquarters
that they weren't add with that said
it's actually grown into manufacturing
education government health I mean even
real estate I reckon sometime in the
future we're gonna start seeing these
maybe even on the street or in public
you know at the grocery store or
something you know we're actually
already on the street we have our first
store that we open on university avenue
in palo alto which is our downtown area
with that said it's the world's first
remotely operated stores there's no
physical employees on site yeah be
pretty wild right we even closed the
door at night remotely so we're on the
streets were definitely there this is
definitely bound to freak some people
out at some point so like what's the
best reaction you've seen from somebody
who you've run into here at CES
someone's actually hit against somebody
else cuz they were scared of it actually
I talked them down from the tree and
then they just you know came over and
started talking to me then they were ok
so was this was this like a like a
five-year-old girl or something like a
small toddler was a grown woman run
woman is a grown man props to you guys
for helping people out making such
innovative movements in the in the tech
industry and scaring the living
daylights out of some people have a good
rest of the time here in Las Vegas thank
you she later whoo
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
