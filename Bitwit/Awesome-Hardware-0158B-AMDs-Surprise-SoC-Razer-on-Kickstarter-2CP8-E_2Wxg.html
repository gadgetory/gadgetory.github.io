right here on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware if you're watching this on
youtube we split the show up into two
halves the first half this week has been
on Paul's channel youtube.com slash
Paul's hardware which you can find the
link up in my description below or if
you're just joining us then stay tuned
you're on the Ausmus up nope not up Wow
am I still saying awesomesauce you're on
the bit wait YouTube he'll there's a
little Freudian slip there sorry about
that one guys but just stay tuned
because this is a epic tech news show
that you guys are gonna enjoy because we
have fun while we're doing it which
means you'll have fun too watching us do
it and have fun that's the mo that's DM
up we occasionally like to have a drink
or five on the show like we have already
so cheers to you guys who are able to
drink with us even if it's just water
you can still drink with us please drink
responsive during King is so broad you
could be drinking anything you should
show them what you drink on the first
half of the show I was Paul was kind
enough to give me some brother felonious
which is a Belgian male those male did I
point out this is 9 percent alcohol by
volume I can definitely tell 9.4% my
liver and brain agree with you on that
one
we can confirm now we're drinking some
Saint Archer or I'm drinking some Saint
Archer white ale which is also very
tasty it's dangerous too because it's
fairly low percentage but it's
incredibly tasty and very refreshing I'm
working on ale Smith nut brown almost
done okay alright we also have stores
that you guys can pick up merchandise
from my store it is bit wit dot tech and
I'm selling lots of cool stuff the CPU
cooler shirt is now available in heather
dark gray as a apologist showing there
we also have the bit wit words in a
circle pint glass these are very popular
and they're extremely high quality in
fact I was walking down the hallway in
the office the other day and a nice
young lady said hey nice glasses and I
said thanks they're Persol and she was
very confused because I was actually
confused because I thought she was
talking about my eyeglasses ah so I
mentioned the name of my glasses and
then of course she was like no I was
talking about your other glasses I was
like oh yeah clearly you were talking
about the glasses that I'm holding in my
hands and not my eyeglasses and you're
not
on my fashionable apparel it was very
awkward hello she was stupid I told her
she was dumb and she should have been
more specific next time when you see a
man wearing glasses holding glasses
specify which glasses you're talking
about is what I is what I should have
said to her otherwise you will cause
great offence yeah so buy the glasses
they'll make you very awkward and and
misunderstood I guess there's the moral
of the story you can also maybe just go
to Paul's store and just buy something
there that won't cause as much
controversy at hardware not net-net
this sounds like I said he's got all
kinds of things like desk mats mouse
pads bottle openers the oxblood screw
sure oxblood thumb screw short hasn't
been a hot seller and you buy anything
from either of our stores you will get a
loud and proud Johnson shout out by the
end of the show which always entices
many defends view speaking out wafer we
neglected to do Johnson's for my half
but we'll do them at the end of this
half of the show hmm
so we should proceed let's proceed to
news news tech news and by the way thank
you Paul for curating a lot of these
stories today I was short on time and
Paul was kind of ahead of the game this
morning so he put a bunch of stories in
the Google Docs all over which I was
like yeah free stories Cal did that for
me like a few weeks back to the stuff
yep super cool where we're broan out
always willing to give each other the
reach-around scratch my back I'll
scratch yours all right so AMD has
recently announced a powerful
semi-custom verizon Vega SOC for game
consoles and PCs this is an article from
PC gamer so thank you to Paul for
writing this article Paul Lily that is
all Paul illy of course now AMD
announced a new semi custom SOC
featuring a fork or an eight thread
Rison processor with 24 vegas --use okay
and eight gigs of gddr5 memory this is
intended to power 8 according to AMD a
new gaming PC and upcoming console in
wait for it China so it doesn't seem
like at least for now the US will get to
experience this new SOC but AMD's worked
with the company songshan's who are on
the project still not sure
what other manufacturers it might be
working with in the future the chip in
question the SOC is running at 3
gigahertz on all four of its cores along
with 24 Vega CCU's clocked at 1.3
gigahertz for graphics that's slightly
fat according to the article and this is
I don't know if this is a typo but
they're saying that that's slightly
faster than an rx 580 which does not
make sense to me at all you don't see
wise frequency wise ok that makes sense
it seemed like when you're comparing it
to a graphics car like that that you're
talking about performance which I don't
think is the case Riley just referencing
their frequency probably just
referencing the clock speed so that
makes a lot more sense it's unclear if
AMD plans on releasing something similar
for the global market or if this is just
a one-off side project intended for
China trying to bring AMD products to a
more global audience it's a very it's a
high possibility so if if they have OMS
and China taking this and integrating it
into console like devices I would be
curious to see if those you know if
they're outfitted with a basic bit of
storage and whatever else is necessary
like the power supply if those would be
viable as like little mini PCs you know
I I'm getting a an urgent message for my
wife saying let me in hurry I need to
use the restroom it's ha ha ha all right
yeah you should I should go let her in
yeah you can you can go since I'm since
it's my half of she if you want where is
she
oh maybe I should just go OK you know ok
just be I'll stay here
wife in distress and keep people
entertained ok cool
she just texted back and said someone's
letting her in so I'm leaving her for
dead I'm but I left her alone hopefully
she gets in safe I'm sure it'll be fine
yeah yeah all right so what did you guys
cover what did I miss in the last what
20 seconds uh we went over the
everything we covered the rest of your
show Oh beautiful okay it's pretty much
great Channel well thank you guys so
much for tuning in see you guys next
week
and to a trade yeah I I did it I did it
in my style which is maybe not quite the
same as your style maybe it was boring
just to give people's mommy what they're
what they're into for your half of the
show maybe maybe you should just recap
things real quick okay I'll recap stuff
maybe starting off with the Google story
about the pixel three okay since we
already talked about the the Vega I'm
sorry too AMD SOC that's a great idea
all right cool let's move on
pixel three Jesus Wow Kyle this from BGR
com Google has mistakenly leaked its
pixel three launch date mistake and
confirms it'll copy Apple again is the
headline here this is a this is tech
today that's the name of the YouTube
channel that first broke the news that
the pixel 3 is launching on October 4th
based on a brand campaign posting on
famebit famebit is a company that's
known for connecting influencers with
brands and helping them make and create
campaign videos apparently so famebit
posted a campaign posting basically
asking canadian influencers to create
content on how easy it is to switch to
the pixel 3 and in this campaign posting
it mentions the pixel 3 is launching
October 4th 2018 so there's definitely
some language here that maybe
contradicts with what pixel with what
Google was trying to keep confidential
but basically spills the beans on the
release date for the the long-awaited
new smartphone
apparently Google is following in in in
Apple's footsteps is what this also
tells us because very much like this
campaign Apple also gave a lot of their
iPhone examples to very popular
influencers long before the launch of
their now flagship phone so it seems
like Google is kind of following that
trend where they're like hey we see the
value in online influencers and like the
power they have to influence consumer
base and so we also now want to give our
phones
to these people and have them talk about
it on their respective YouTube channels
or social media platforms for promotion
and shit like that
so I thought they were also copying the
knotch yes so that is not the only way
they're copying Apple I was just getting
to that
they are also gonna be copying Apple and
in a sense design language wise with the
physicality of their phone having a
notch you can see that there's a notch
here on this mock-up of what looks to be
a potential pixel 3 phone and it was
very very popular very very
revolutionary with the iPhone X having a
notch in it and now like how the power
button matches the desktop like the
background image yes yes it does it's
very with it what is this a fucking sand
on the beach does it change color what
is this like a TLD video it was just
super crispy in all ways but um so so
Google seems to be copying Apple a lot
here following in their footsteps
they've also swiped the iPhone X
gestures for Android which also
indicates that they're very closely
following the Apple trend here it's very
unclear whether October 4th is when the
pixel will actually hit store shelves or
if it's just an announcement date but at
the very least it will probably be a
week or so before the the pixel 3
launches after October 4th if it isn't
or forth in fact so um yeah pixel three
what thoughts and opinions on the knotch
because I feel like to me it's such a
small change doesn't seem very
revolutionary to me but people seem to
be making a huge fuss about the knotch
there's so many varying opinions about
this thing that like maybe it's worthy
of discussion like does it change
anything for you do you care if your
next phone has a notch or not what does
this actually mean for the average user
you get maybe a couple millimeters more
of space for your date and time maybe
notification bar like I'm torn right I'm
torn
cuz if I look at my phone because I have
an original pixel XL there's a lot of
space up here at the top sure so that
could be more screen space and if I'm
looking at like my notifications if they
were up there then that would be more
screen space sure screen space is always
nice you know everyone's always talking
about like the edge to edge you know if
you had a phone that actually had the
full edge to edge display right
everywhere that'd be kind of cool right
so I don't like I don't I guess I'm not
opposed to it but like when the iPhone X
came out there was so much discussion
about it back and forth like and
everything like I feel like it was I
feel like the idea of it was tainted
it's tainted now here's my thing is that
often times all have notification icons
at the very top of my screen all the way
across from left to right across the
phone so what happens if you have an
otter in the middle if don't feel dirty
I mean get rid of your notifications cap
no I do but I'm just saying at a given
moment when I haven't checked my phone
in five fricking minutes the
notification icons will fill up and then
it's like this clusterfuck at the top of
my phone what happens when you have a
notch at the top doesn't do the icons
float around the knob that's one of the
added features it's basically telling
you you need to be more of an asshole
like as a
person in order to drive more people
away so you have less people contacting
you for your notification simplify your
life make everything better I'm pretty
sure that's not the the overall message
the overarching message that Apple or
Google we're trying to go through fuck
else with the notch exist Kyle you have
too many friends do you need enough
friends fill up like this many
notifications on the left side of the
notch and that's all the knotch aka the
friend blocker has have been implemented
across many Universal smartphones
worldwide okay let us know what you guys
as thoughts are on the knotch
let's move on to our next article here
Mars Mars pulls ads from YouTube drill
videos now when you first suggested that
I talk about this article on the show
doc yeah I know I initially thought you
meant the planet Mars has pulled
advertisements from YouTube videos
featuring power drills yeah that's
that's what I thought it was about - but
instead you were talking about Mars the
candy company ah not the planet pulling
all their advertising from YouTube after
discovering one of their ads was played
just before a drill music video now what
the hell is drill music I hate to sound
irrelevant but this is the first time
I've personally ever heard the term
drill music I have never heard this term
before I did not know drill music
existed until this day
so drill music apparently from what I
have gathered on the interwebs is it's
basically a type of rap music that
allegedly glamorizes gang violence and
has been used in many instances to feel
rivalries between gangs now this is just
my impression of drill music based on
the article I've read it doesn't mean
that that is what it is I thought that
was all rap music cap that could be all
rap music as well that's a very
generalization type statement Paul and
I'm not sure everyone would agree
everyone would agree with but apparently
the people in this article are painting
drill music in a poor light in fact what
are the members of the group who
uploaded the video in question the drill
Mew
video Siddiq camara was stabbed to death
in South London just a week ago that's
him right there
that guy that guy is currently dead
fatally stabbed and he is part of the
group that uploaded this music video of
which there was a Mars commercial
playing before it which caused Mars to
back out of all of their advertising on
YouTube which equation about this is
picture right as he realizes he's about
to be stabbed it looked I mean that I
would have a much more fearful face that
looks like like the face that maybe like
someone was about to tell him he was
about to be I don't know I'm not exactly
sure what's going on in that picture of
what was happening but at the end of the
day it seems that this is a big this is
a lot of money that YouTube is now
losing that that creators like me and
Paul like me and you are losing now from
a company like Mars backing out
apparently their advertising was worth
about 5 million pounds British pounds to
the to the YouTube website it's a lot of
money it's pretty brutal I mean it's
interesting to see how what I always
find find curious is how brands
associate so strongly with the content
their ads are being played on which I
guess makes sense to a degree but it's
still very much an old way of thinking
in my opinion like just the way ads are
structured like okay for example if one
of my ads was played on like some
YouTube video that I didn't necessarily
agree with I'm like that's like I don't
align like my brand doesn't align with
the beliefs of that brand one of your
ads yeah like just no no like like if my
let's say I created a pre-roll for
myself like subscribed a bit way okay I
created my own pre-roll and my pre-roll
somehow aired on like a PewDiePie video
where he was talking about like Nazis
and shit because that's actually
happened I don't know if I would
necessarily be like my brand doesn't
align with those
and morals and therefore I'm backing out
all of my advertising spend with this
company and this brand and this website
of course I would definitely make a
statement be like obvious I don't
reflect these these these morals or
whatever but at the same time it's just
it's interesting to me how these brands
are so sensitive with the content that's
being played right after their ads which
I guess they can be because people get
to our super cent I feel like people are
hypersensitive these days where it's
like the person who there's probably
like 1% of people who see the Mars
commercial for Snickers or something I
don't even I don't even know s'mores own
Snickers but let's say there's like a
Mars - Snickers commercial that airs
before some vaguely politically racist
content like there's got to be like a
small handful of people who watch that
who see that and like tweet to Mars like
how dare you support and advertise your
your brand on such heinous and
despicable content like it's a popular
thing to you know like don't these
people know these are randomly generated
blue as a public who's a public figure
says something that people don't agree
with to attack their advertisers or to
go to communicate to the advertisers and
try to get the advertisers to pull out
from something but like the implication
here is that like if if advertisers are
hesitant to provide ad money for a
platform where they don't know where
their ads are gonna be placed and if the
ads are gonna be placed in juxtaposition
to something that they've that you know
is offensive or they find out you know
be a negative association for their
brands then they're not gonna want to
advertise there I don't I don't I don't
know that like the you know the upshot
from all this but you know hopefully
it's not the there's no up here
hopefully this hopefully it's not the
kicking off of like some you know second
wave of ad you know companies pulling
ads off of youtube or something like
that because I would suck the ad
pocalypse from was it last year whatever
that right 20
17 I was very inconvenient for many
people and we're still feeling the
effects of it I would I would say
apparently now the music video has been
demonetised no surprise and what this
means for us is that all and I can can
no longer use drill music in our in our
tech videos I'm I'm pissed about I'm
very upset I want to pull my ads from
Mars candy bars yeah I'm stopping all
they're no longer advertising on Mars
candy bars I'm eating I'm eating Abbas
Abbas only from now on show my
resilience okay let's move on to the
next story from bit tech dotnet razor
has turned to Kickstarter in order to
raise funds for their left-handed Naga
Trinity the Naga Trinity is a very
popular Mouse from Leah and the
peripheral giant and now they're trying
to get fans to raise money for this new
product CEO min-liang tan claims that
previous left-handed models have been
created at a loss so let's make the
customers fund it let's create a
Kickstarter campaign where people who
really give a shit and who really want a
Naga Trinity left-handed gaming mouse
can fund it up to nine hundred and
ninety thousand dollars which is their
crowd funded goal actually I've
currently met about thirty four thousand
of they have 24 days to go and it's
gonna be it's gonna be a stretch it's
gonna be a long road seems like they've
got a ways to go
they have a ways to go granted they
still have about a month but that's a
lot of money a million dollars is a lot
of money even for a giant crowd-sourced
campaign audience so um what's what's
going on here apparently Razer according
to them they've been one of the only
sources in the game to produce a
left-handed left-handed Gaming Mouse in
recent years and they've according to
CEO have produced these left-handed
left-handed gaming mice at a loss
so Kickstarter and and sites like it
have become a really popular way for
these bigger brands
to launch new product lines at very
minimal risk because if Razer has been
producing a bunch of left-handed
left-handed mice that they've
essentially taken a loss on and have
been losing money on there's really no
harm no foul in producing a Kickstarter
campaign that advocates for a
left-handed gaming mouse because if it
fails this is an all-or-nothing campaign
if they do not meet the nine hundred and
ninety thousand dollar goal then this
whole project is completely scrapped and
Razer does not lose a dime and they just
get to keep all the Kickstarter money no
all the money will be refunded back to
all the backers Paul but so it's
interesting that they've taken to this
platform for this initiative which I
think kind of makes sense you know if
there's a large enough demand for it but
razors like hey shit I don't want to
like lose a couple million dollars from
something that people aren't going to
want to invest in then it kind of makes
sense again I don't it's not looking
that great it could always turn around
but I feel like I don't know for it
launching a day ago it should be a lot
higher than 35 K if they stand a chance
because this campaign is only gonna
fizzle out as time goes on between now
and the the 24 or whatever 24 days that
they have left to go the funding is just
gonna get lower and lower
after each passing day the Kyle this is
this this dollar amount we're looking at
here was before we talked about it on
awesome hardware you're right Paul and
now that we've given it the promotional
tools it needs from a globally
recognized livestream there's no way
that it can fail gave it the awesome
hardware bump you can feel free to
advertise with us at any time just
contact one of our famous PR agents yes
here's what I don't understand right so
manufacturing processes for something
like this there's a lot of money that
goes into tooling to create the
production lines that can they can spit
the products out right right the
products designed and then they gotta
create the tooling there so there's some
custom work that goes on there once it's
created they can manufacture it and you
know a lot of that cost is sort of front
loaded
right so what I am kind of confused
about when it comes to left-handed mice
because most people who most left-handed
mice are actually just ambidextrous so
they're creative with like sort of a
symmetrical design right left to right
so you know this work sure but like why
couldn't they take the existing design
of the Razer Naga Trinity and just flip
it like great 180 they did all this
design so people you still need a new
tooling with it don't you you need to do
more tooling and stuff what I'm saying
is like like isn't the design work
already done isn't isn't doesn't that I
honestly think this is just covering the
cost of the Tooley okay so you have a
global audience like Razer does
I feel like tooling for a new product
like this could cost upwards of a
million dollars that's totally possible
I don't know about that side of the
industry to say I don't know either but
it just seems to be the case if they're
if they're asking for this much for
their goal I've heard from different
articles and different sources and stuff
that tooling is incredibly expensive for
something like a gaming mouse where yeah
I think a lot of there are Indies sorry
just keep burping I'm just gonna burp my
way through this entire article I think
all their R&amp;amp;D is pretty much done
because they already know that Naga
Trinity works and they already know how
it's gonna be designed but the actual
tooling that they have with you know
whatever manufacturers in China or
wherever they're doing the manufacturing
from I think is a huge bulk of the cost
which is what's causing their losses
with a lot of the existing left headed
mice that razer currently makes so I
think I think what I think Razer here is
just kind of calling their audiences
Bluff and saying hey all of you people
who are like on our forums like
complaining that we don't have a
dedicated left-handed gaming mouse let's
put your money where your mouth is
make it if you if we if you guys show
enough interest in wanting this product
if you're gonna up front like front us a
little bit of money here then we'll make
it happen but you guys got to show us
that there's a large enough market for
us to be for it to be worth it so which
which i think is a fair you know that's
fair if there's a huge enough demand
then razer will do it so I guess the
success of this campaign I can imagine
if you're lefty and you've like you know
been forced to use a right-handed mouse
or something like that then actually
getting a mouse that's designed for left
for lefty is probably we should have we
should have brought in like like an
actual native left-handed user in here
and like gotten his two cents on it
because I feel like a lot of left-handed
users will actually still use their
right hand for gaming purposes I know a
lot of left-handed users that still use
a mouse right-handed just because that's
the only thing that's been available to
them since they were since they were
young you know growing up in school but
you know they didn't have a left-handed
mouse option when you were in typing
class and third grade or whatever so I
feel like a lot of left-handed users are
still using mice right-handed and
they're perfectly fine with it but and
because of that I feel like it makes the
market for like dedicated left-handed
Mouse users even smaller I guess time
will tell to see if if there's actually
a huge demand for that but let's move on
to our last article here because we're
short on time once again Elon Musk has
tweeted the Tesla may go private what
okay let's let's talk about this is an
article who WCF tech right and yeah
private privates private parts all
around and Paul I'll probably rely on
you somewhat for this story because I
don't really know why anything about
stocks or how the stock market works and
even though you don't invest in stocks
yourself I feel like you're still more
well-versed in the matter than I am so
I'm gonna read off a bunch of jargon
that's pulled quite frankly directly
from the article which then you can
paraphrase into words that make sense to
our audience thank you in advance do
saddle me with responsibilities so thank
you very much Paul for all of your help
that you'll be contributing to this
article musk ok Elon Musk the sea
of SpaceX and Tesla and the boring the
boring company most importantly tweeted
recently he tweeted this week am
considering and considering taking Tesla
private at four hundred and twenty
dollars funding secured first of all I
like how he he settled with 420 like
where was like he was just like where
was the hashtag where is the hashtag
blaze it blaze it 420 blaze it at the
end of that tweet
shortly after do you think about this
let the gravity of this situation sink
into your minds shortly after Elon Musk
tweeted a tweet the stock prices for
Tesla surge regulators temporarily
halted trading as pending news from the
company swirled
could you imagine if you just tweeted
something from your phone like you're
you're taking a shit you tweet something
that it changes all of Wall Street like
they stopped all trading for that stock
in particular and and the stock pricing
for your particular company just goes
off the charts just because you tweeted
something while you were taking your
shit Tesla is currently the most shorted
company on Wall Street many investors
will lose money lose lots of money if
the company succeeds in Elon Musk has
expressed many times how this annoys him
he's also said that the the funding to
take the company private at four hundred
and twenty dollars per share was secured
so he seems very confident here the
buyout is good for a twenty percent
premium over the current market price of
the stock and would value the company at
over seventy billion dollars at current
numbers of outstanding shares if the CEO
himself Elon Musk owns roughly twenty
percent of Tesla he would need about
fifty billion dollars in additional
capital to fully privatize the company
alongside with a shareholder vote of yes
on the move so the shareholders need to
agree that this is a good idea and in
how the company moves forward um he
seems pretty confident that the money is
there and as he demonstrated in the
follow-up tweet he said investor support
is confirm
only reason why this is not certain is
that it's a contingent on a shareholder
vote so again the shareholders need to
need to back this up
Saudi Arabia just to make things even
more intense
Saudi Arabia wealth funds brought up to
it
up to a two billion dollar stake and
Tesla recently so it's possible that
musk has in fact secured funding from
overseas and trading for Tesla stock was
reactivated just before the closing bell
was rung so just in the last minute
they're like okay we can trade Tesla
stock again and the automaker closed the
day of 12% so they went up 12 percent in
a single day
realizing a massive six billion dollar
appreciation and market capitalization
tweet one tweet sent from the shitter
and you've now gained a six billion
dollar appreciation and market cap Elon
Musk definitely has some influence there
so uh I don't know what any of what I
just said means I was just kind of
rambling off what the article I mean I
get the gist of it but essentially it
seems like Tesla may go private at that
point what happens to the shareholders
the shareholders would get paid out for
their for their holdings right so
whatever stock they have they get the
money yeah
so if he's taking it private at four
hundred twenty dollars a share then
anyone who owns shares would get paid
for her and $20 per share that they
owned sure as a payout and I don't I
don't know what happens between him
saying I'm thinking about taking it
public in pardon $20 a share and it's
surging like it does and then suddenly
the value of being more than it was
because obviously the price per share is
now more than 420 dollars right I don't
know I don't know how that gets worked
out right what ya know what like what I
didn't really get from this article and
this is just me being a noob about
stocks and the market in general is why
why would he want to go private in the
first place
I think the reason he wants to go
private is because he likes to less
pressure it like it's it's like he likes
to do his own thing a lot of the time
and he also I think likes to take risk
like to be likes to be some trick likes
sure eccentric or just contrary like
sure right so there's been a ton of like
like you said Tesla's the most shorted
stock on the market right yeah and when
you short a stock it means you're
betting on that stock losing value it's
not if you're short of stock and it
loses value you make money right if
you're short a stock and a stock value
goes up then the person who a short in
the stock loses money right so it so so
Elon has certainly from because I follow
him on Twitter and stuff like he's
certainly at times in the past sort of
lashed out at people who have shorted
his stock him like haha you people who
thought the stock was about to tanked
because of model 3 production or
whatever right you were wrong and now
you've lost money right but I think he
also probably has his own personal
opinions about how the stock market
works in general and yeah there's a lot
of benefits to being a privately run
company versus public there's a lot of
stuff that you don't have to disclose
when it's private versus public and
you're blessed beholden to stock owners
and and the sort of the vicissitudes of
the market so to speak and then explain
explain what happened with like Saudi
Arabia wealth funds bringing up to a two
billion dollar stake does that mean they
bought two billion dollars in stock
so if the market cap is the market cap
is the number of stocks that are
available then I'm the quantity of stock
that's available in their company times
the value of that stock that's that's
the market cap right so if the market
cap is at a certain point right now that
anyone who owns stock in Tesla in order
for it to go private would need to be
bought out Elon Musk probably doesn't
have that
my capital capital to just buy all those
all those people who own stock out in
order to go public so he needs an
investor in order to do that and then
he's saying the investor is coming from
Saudi Arabia
I see interesting okay well um you know
Tesla's definitely been grappling with a
lot of issues financially and
logistically they just now ramped up
their model three productions buy new
says spider fan thick spider is one of
our other mods in chat sigh himself he
says Eon says he's not forcing sales so
existing shareholders can keep their
piece yeah a lot of the I haven't read
up too much on the story so arm but yeah
that's good to know as well all right
all right well that's what's going on
with Tesla I guess we can move on to
pimp my PC yeah busy let's start off
with Samuel Sam you well okay let's what
kind of system is this if you get a
Corsair and I get I need to get your
updated oh yeah we just put that one ass
or something um so we've got as of
course he respects your one for our case
in MSI 970 gaming RX 580 and a 1050 TI
for encoding while gaining on the 580
interesting huh what a peculiar setup -
demon and coud at the same time yeah
what do what everybody is talking about
gaming and streaming your game on the
Phi B and set encoding like with envying
me do that though yeah really
so you don't need a second system if you
want to like stream with one and game
with another I don't have GPS I don't
think so okay he's given FX 83-70 hyper
X 16 gig kit and some other stuff
alright okay what I will say right off
the bat is color color is kind of
mismatched here you have red accents on
your heat sinks on the motherboard but a
green LED fan in the back
and what looks to be white up top maybe
blue or blue at any rate I would change
them all to red
I think that would look sweet black and
red is like it's like arguably
overplayed but also tried-and-true and
cannot look bad it's also very easy to
find matching very easy and it will not
look bad it might be common but it won't
look bad
black and red looks very good so maybe
swapping out that green fan for a red
one unless it's RGB then just configure
it to red and having some red LED fans
at the top to make I'd say make all
three the same all three fans the same
model we also we only have a single
picture here so it's possible that like
the colors on the graphics card and the
fans are all cycling or something like
that but yeah I mean lining those up
would probably look a little bit better
I like how full the system looks with
the two graphics cards does it look like
it's graphic like the top card is
leaning on the hard drive cage like it's
using us actually it might be sitting on
that it almost looks perfectly like
aligned with the card which isn't bad I
mean it looks straight yeah zero sag no
sag there that's kind of perfect I'm
your cable management is mostly good I
mean there's there's a little bit of I
mean you might tidy some of the stuff up
back here it's also possibly the angle
of the picture and the fact there's a
flash that's really brightening that up
and making it stand out more so yeah
overall pretty clean looking system I
mean the assortment of hardware that you
have in there and it sounds like you're
making good use out of it so yeah yeah
hopefully some of Kyle's suggestions
help you out if you're having any issues
syncing things up good Samuel Oh next
time we have Hank what does he guys 7600
K Strix Z to 70e Kraken X 52 32 gigs of
RAM GTX 1080 a 970 Evo and a 2 terabyte
nvme Drive alright well then so I
appreciate the the rear shot of the
cable management here yep it looks like
he's using an SSD tray to
his cables here I want to I want to give
a shout-out to that I appreciate that
verse that's the steam added you just
might have a really fun about that yeah
well - or Wow all right
this side of the system way and I'm
confused here all right first off you
got Campbell combs here these really
need to be spaced out if you can push
them all down underneath so you can't
see them at all and the cables are still
still straight do that yeah if not try
to minimize it so you only have one or
maybe two of these visible it's best to
keep these cable come back I'm out kind
of in place to line things up but if you
can then also push them out of out of
sight that's a little bit better it also
looks like slightly different that you
have your 8 and 6 pin for your graphics
card all tidy here and then the 24 pin
here is it makes the 24 point you like
look less yeah bring some of those cable
comes over closer the connector what
what the heck is this why this looks
this looks like an external USB 3.0 but
I don't know what it's plugged into
right there there's I don't know any
motherboard that has a plug on it right
here that something like this cable
would need to be plugged into that's
blue what is this what port is it I am
baffled what word is that
it looks like an Intel main stream he's
got a 970 Evo in there so it's no he
didn't list the he said Strix - Strix -
70 - 70 - II so do skilled memories
looking clean I mean yeah you're you're
you're dead-on view of the system here
is looking very clean and like I think
what a lot of people aim for when it
when they're putting a system together
and throw on the RGB design in there and
everything what else I don't know push
pull on the front end front radiator I
mean I guess that's okay the cables from
that people are saying it's maybe
external PCIe
that's so weird though like that's a
weird why I don't know I'm I really it's
so weird
really not sure about that okay we got
these top fans up here too
I'm not sure so yeah I don't have a lot
of suggestions that set for the cable
combs aesthetically and then I don't
know can you get a 24-pin cable come as
well that's a straighten those out that
might be nice yeah and then I had such
as I'm just so baffled by the little
blue extension down there but thank you
Hank for sending that every night system
though James James for a 760 900 K 4.2
gigahertz at one point two three volts
of Corsair Dominator Platinum 32 gigs at
2400 Asus x99 deluxe MSI GTX 1080 TI a
bunch of other cool stuff in win 303 EK
water cooling goodies alright so first
off I'm gonna say this before Paul does
get your PC off the floor your drop
floor computer a flaw if you really care
about it and Wow like the tubing looks
really nice it's soft tubing so no
elegant hard tubing here but it still
looks really cool I'm you're using like
a matte black tubing which I think looks
really nice with some gold fittings or
what looks to be gold fittings leaves
from the picture here
I think reflection I think okay so it's
actually Chrome but it looks really nice
as far as pimping out this PC I honestly
think that hard line tubing would make
the system look a little bit nicer
because the specs are already there you
don't have to upgrade anything spec wise
you have tons of air flow in this case
looks like you've got two of those mlpro
maglev fans at the bottom which is where
the Inman 303 gets all of its intake
from plenty of are those halos at the
top looks like those are halos at the
top of your top phones are using these
fantex fantex halos which also look very
nice it's very it's a beautiful system
it's a really beautiful system and
honestly the only thing that I could
really say here is to go hardline if you
were really feeling it
if you
up to the task and maybe topping off
your reservoir because the reservoir
looks a little bit low I agree with Kyle
about topping out the reservoir I
actually think the flexible black tubing
I think it looks fine well just because
you built Riptide recently and you're on
a urine a freaking soft tube hi I want
to say the Jesus the graphics card
supplemental power cables look a little
off to me one's gone one way there there
pick those could be tidied up they
should be together there should be a
system over that but yeah I mean they
could build a build oh stand for it get
it up off the ground if you can yeah and
replace these speakers these are like
speakers from 1992 or something
these are beige I think I had these
speakers oh yeah those are all like in
1992 but thank you for the wide shot I
think the man of the set up so we could
critique it more next time we have tray
with an Intel Core i5 3570 and Asus Tech
p8z 77v
Alexa motherboard 16 gigs of ddr3 and
EVGA GTX 1066 gigabyte card and some
storage here ok so you got some really
solid bones to the system the components
selection is really solid but I feel
like your case is holding you back in
terms of aesthetics and performance
perhaps because even though you have a
couple fans at the front panel I feel
like they're just kind of getting
blocked by the hard drive cage there
you've got a hard drive cage even you
know even though you only have one drive
there and I'm sorry one mechanical and
one SSD I can't imagine much of that
airflow is actually getting to your
graphics card for example so maybe
getting a new case would be I think
would do wonders for your system as far
as the other things going on here cable
management could be much improved again
that could be helped along with a newer
case that has better better cable
management maybe with a power power
supply shroud better configured grommets
and things like that
more room behind the motherboard tray
there's also kind of a mishmash of color
here you have green
in the background of your of your case
on the on the motherboard tray but your
memory is blue but you've got green LEDs
on the front intake fans looks like
you're like wrestling with blue and
green I would say just stick to one or
the other it doesn't matter what he his
motherboard is one of I believe one of
those Asus ones has the light blue
accents yeah right yeah yeah he's 77
boards yep
so I was about to say man you could you
could swap your power supply for one of
the 27 even the 2017 version of the
corsair CX 500 mm-hmm has all black
cables reign and get rid of a lot of
that ketchup and mustard stuff and maybe
not have to use the PCI Express
extensions that you have going on down
in sure like a new power supply and a
dusting out and sort of a rewiring I
think could do wonders here but you'd
still be stuck with the blue that that
just doesn't match and doesn't go with
the with the green on the case so yeah
it's hard to tell you maybe just upgrade
your platform as a whole
yeah I mean your if you if you really
want stuff to match and you want to use
this case then you're gonna have to
upgrade some core components here yeah
other than that like I don't know could
you is this back plate here the green
back motherboard tray is that removable
if you can remove that take it out paint
it blue I highly doubt it
take it out painted blue it'll match
with everything else sure and get that
new power supply you'll be golden but it
looks like this system just needs some
TLC it's on the floor again you know you
got a SSD just kind of hanging out in
there and I'm not mounted you got some
dust in there oh just take your system
and give it some love yeah it's really
green and finally we have a Steve Hahn
with the honorable mention with a
fractal design define r6 and Asus z3 70e
with the core i7 8700 k 5.1 gigahertz
Jesus a dual Asus GTX GTX 1080i I'm
sorry 10a and SLI setup of Corsair
Vengeance RGB RAM 32 gigs and which one
shit this is a very very nice-looking
system tubing job is on fleek as the
kids say these days also because you
really need to like bend anything
yourself you're just using like fittings
and stuff to to make all your runs
happen which is totally fine it makes it
look very clean and straight a very
beautiful system interesting how you
have your front two fans as exhausts
particularly yeah
wouldn't expect that I wonder if you did
that purely for aesthetics and that's
what I was thinking is because the white
ring was filling with the window on from
the outside you would yep
you definitely see it which which I'm
sure temps are fine you know yeah and
maybe he's got he's got he's got no
exhaust at the back and there's nothing
at the bottom so if everything is
exhausting then he has negative a
pressure which might give you some dust
buildup in weird places but it's not
necessarily like bad air flow if it's a
showpiece it's fine you know yeah it's
not bad
I'm sure temps are great love that
monoblock I love the the choice of RAM
with with everything like the even the
sli bridge looks really nice with
everything else very very well balanced
and well thought-out system these bits
power believes these are bits part
fittings ideas for the hard lines look
great they're so small like they're like
the fitting the fitting above the the
keep yeah I get so it's like three
millimeters they're like low profile
profile that's pretty cool oh yeah very
very beautiful so thank you very much
for saying that in Steve thank you guys
for sending all of your systems and to
put my PC we'll be doing this again
shortly in a future episode but for now
we can move on to Q &amp;amp; A so let's see
beautiful okay
bazinga X once again I found one the
thermaltake WP 200 case can hold over 48
drives with additional rails
well I have to see this wait what the
Thermaltake WP 200 okay yes if you want
to buy a case like that that's fine uh
the problem the problem with a case like
that that can house that many drives is
that it is still at the end of the day
not as reliable as a enterprise this is
one of the case labs knock-offs
it's still not as reliable as an
enterprise-level disk shelf especially
if you're using a SAS connection which a
lot of disks disk shelfs use the the SAS
connection will actually use as a
redundant connection so even if one of
the one of the connections dies there's
like a backup connection from what I
understand and they're also just like
their enterprise levels so they're gonna
last you a lot longer when you're
talking about 24/7 use assuming that you
are gonna be using all of your drives
all the time it's just it's it's one of
those things where like this is where
the enterprise level hardware really
makes a difference is when you are using
your hardware for 24/7 use so even
though this case can house 48 drives or
whatever
it still is probably not nearly as
reliable as like an LSI disk shelf and
you can confirm this with other other
sources that you find but yes it's an
impressive case in that regard doesn't
mean it's gonna be reliable just because
it has enough Bay housings for 48 drives
but I wish you best of luck in your
server building endeavor and maybe you
can post some pics of it on a future to
my PC that'd be kind of cool
ginger hawk for 99 I have an AMD FX
series PC with Windows 10 and plan on
upgrading the motherboard CPU and RAM to
Bryson update drivers and go
reinstall windows 10 and driver help I
think if you're if you're coming from
the AMD FX series you're planning on
upgrading your motherboard CPU and RAM
then it seems like you're just building
a new system entirely in that sense then
I would just say either buy a new copy
of Windows or if you can't afford it
then maybe look into upgrading your
current system from well actually I
don't know how that would work I'd
probably just do a clean install man I'd
probably just do a clean install of
Windows 10 you can find a key for 30
bucks on kinguin that's pretty much if
you have one if you have Windows 10 and
it's it's activated to your hardware you
can switch it over to a new system oh no
he's plenty on upgrading motherboard CPU
and RAM um you're gonna need to buy a
new Windows 10 just buy a new key on
kinguin yeah same comments as last half
donated twice bazinga
$50 thank you very much for the generous
donation thank you for seeing a charity
challenge Paul Greg Kyle Steve gnj I
will donate $2 per push up that each of
you do within a 10 minute time frame to
st. Jude Children's Hospital the name of
the winner 50 dollars to the winner post
end of August that's actually
interesting who would win in a push-up
contest J me you Greg from South as
science studio or J Greg is the leanest
he's the youngest he's the youngest
ugliness and the meanest he could
definitely he could definitely beat uh
all of us in terms of push-ups I would
think probably him and then maybe Steve
Steve maybe afterwards Steve does bike
riding and stuff more so lower lower
body but I think I could probably get
away with like 10 push-ups so don't
don't put your money on me doesn't get
but thank you for the donation Brian
Alvarez $5 I 787 hundred K ASIS hero X
or 10 16 gigs g.skill 3k RAM and 960 Evo
500 gig build but built but waiting on
the new cards look forward to the
graphics card reviews
uh graphics card reviews on maybe it'll
be 11 80s presumably he's talking about
at any rate I wish you luck on your
system bill Bryant sounds like it's
pretty it's gonna be pretty awesome it's
a nice setup a 200k for sure
mst3k ten dollars if I did one pushup
I'd probably need an ambulance yeah well
I hope I hope I could at least do one I
think would be really sad if we couldn't
could you imagine like if someone
benchmarked us and our physical know the
physical prowess not fair at all like if
we were just resorted like if we were
just boiled down to like graphs and
charts it's like her we're just Paul
stack up on this this Bahamas benchmark
3d mark pull-up extreme I feel
self-conscious right now I know me too
is bringing up that I know ice ability I
know I do too
yeah you just you just have a jock on on
stream and just ask him technical
questions to make this feel better
terrible and ruch where and you know I'm
sorry bazinga X once again $10 greg from
science to do is willing to do the
challenge I guess of course he is
because we just announced that he would
probably win it of course he would be
down to do the challenge anyone who
knows what they're gonna win a challenge
is down to do the challenge
first rule of order I guess the se
techies care more about children yes I
am trying to shame you two into the
challenge is II southeast no we're
southwest if anything he's saying Greg
is southeast oh oh okay okay okay
it's the southeast does he live in never
yet okay
he must be southeast they care yes Greg
cares more about children than polar I
do I hate children I'd fucking kill them
all and you Swire five Canadians from my
last donation I was giving credit to the
person who gave the idea but this will
be my be my last donation for a while
uni is coming up Cheers
Andrew shit save your money save your
money Fuchs dude yeah see pizza for
books for life for children
for books or anything else besides us
this is probably a more worthwhile
investment but thank you anyway
Maddy is 20 to 30 dollar donation Thank
You Kyle and Paul I love your show it
helps kill time at work and makes it
more bearable I work as a system
specialist and my job can be a drag
sometimes keep up the great work I love
your Asian voice Kyle oh well that
doesn't that is just so lovely so you
know I got a feature more lyle on the
channel you know he's been he's been
asking me to be featured more after you
know all of the positive feedback that
he's received i think it's kind of
gotten to his head so we'll see if we
can bring him back down the channel
sometime student that input and
domination maddie i smash
i hope i'm glad that we can make your
your your your work week more bearable
that's what we're here for jj5 cool one
499 my hardline tubes out of the cpu
block melted and leaked it melted Wow
what should I check for 59 30k x99
sabertooth course there's six I'm gonna
see bottom front rad fans on in take
your hardline tubes LT should not have
melted no they should not have that
sounds like something's very very wrong
I wish I knew more I wish I knew what
part which tubes melted which which
tubes that were connected to which
components were actually affected it
seems like there's some serious
overheating if that is the case you
might want to check your your CPU maybe
plop it into a different motherboard and
check the temperature there if you if
it's possible maybe consider integrating
a temperature sensor into your loop so
you can check on what temperature your
actual fluid is yeah and make sure it's
not getting above 60 C yep it's pretty
rough though so good lie that sucks MB
67 13 dollars and 37 cents Kyle I saw
your post on Instagram and I'd like to
know how you were able to get that a a
Oh in that case same a oh but mine was
too big to fit in that tiny space heyo
anyway Cheers
Mb this is the newest version of the dan
case this is v3 it literally just
arrived on my doorstep like a week ago
the v3 unlike the v1 and v2 has native
support for a 92 millimeter a oh yes
that's right a 92 millimeter radiator
AIO which I'll be detailing in a future
video coming soon with August PC of the
month here so this allows you to
basically mount a 92 millimeter AO into
this case without having to remove the
front panel USB 3 which is what v1 and
v2 users were having to sacrifice when
placing this exact a i/o into their Dan
cases so I'm very proud that it all
worked out this allows you to fit that
radiator in here without sacrificing the
the front panel USB 3 I have a
liquid-cooled Rison 7 chip in here with
the GTX 1080i and it's basically smaller
than than one of pulse arms um I'm not
too big a clearance code the tubing
clearance is is negligible it's very
flexible and I've been able to get the
side panel on multiple times without it
ever causing any issue the side panels
include Lee and Lee's pin mechanism
they're their pin technology with the
various latches as well as a couple
couple Phillips head screws that secure
the side panel on there but there's
actually no problem at all mounting the
side panels on to that system as it's
currently built but MB yes it was there
were definitely some challenges building
that system it's it's one of the more
challenging small form-factor builds
that i've done in recent memory and most
of the problems that I had stem directly
from the AI Oh in some way but that will
all be detailed in the August PC of the
month video that's hitting floatplane
later tonight and in you and will hit
YouTube in a week or two at any rate
thank you very much for the donation
finally we have a comment from cell are
a good friend and moderator cat Kyle
happy third wedding anniversary of the
elusive wifey sauce yes
happy Anniversary Kyle today marks the
third year anniversary of my and wifey
sauces wedding three
years we've been married three years
officially now and yeah we were still
we're still not divorced so that's a
good sign
that's that everyone's like hell yeah
you keep you keep that's dang not
divorced part of marriage maintaining
marriage part of marriage is not getting
the work so congratulations to us
thank you very much cell for the
congratulatory words as well as you Paul
and I'm probably I'm probably gonna get
probably gonna get in trouble when I
when I when I end the show because I
spent our anniversary doing a live show
for you guys instead of celebrating with
my wife that's okay the sacrifices that
us youtubers make is clearly on tonight
and I pointed this out earlier but we
got three year wedding anniversary yeah
158 awesome Hardware anniversary yeah so
if you really want to compare how do you
go toe-to-toe heavy balance those
assuming come at me bro Sam we got we
got the numbers members that YouTube
logic okay we got a final donation from
crit fish $5 says great job guys thank
you quit for thank you we appreciate the
congratulatory great job donating no no
no no walk you out of this room okay if
your sauce has been he's left the
building triggered these triggers she's
clearly pissed off okay okay let's let's
uh get ready to wrap the show up here
