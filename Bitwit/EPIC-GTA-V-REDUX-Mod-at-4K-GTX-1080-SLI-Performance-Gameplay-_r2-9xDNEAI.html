channel hope you're all doing well today
we're gonna be testing out what's quite
possibly the most long-awaited and quite
frankly ambitious mod for GTA 5 on PC
that we've seen to date and it's by a
guy named Josh from Edo more on that in
a sec but essentially it's a just
massive graphics overhaul of the game so
everything from global illumination
anti-aliasing you know particle effects
all that stuff has been cranked to 11
and holy smokes it it's pretty gorgeous
in addition to that there's also some
non visual tweaks here including things
like AI behavior weapon mechanics and
vehicle handling and that sort of thing
but I'm not really interested too much
in that as fun as that sounds for the
purpose of this video I'm more concerned
with what kind of performance hit this
is going to mean for any given system
particularly and specifically the one
that I have back here on my test bed
rocking a Core i5
6600 K stock frequency and two gtx 1080s
in sli those are also at stock frequency
the reason for that is because I
couldn't get the mod to work properly
without crashing anytime I would load up
any sort of overclocking utility so
stock frequencies across the board in
case you're curious we've got a Founders
Edition 1080 on there as well as a
gaming X 1080 from MSI and I didn't
they're kind of different heights so I
didn't I couldn't use my high bandwidth
sli bridge so I just used two different
ribbon style SLI bridges specifically
we're going to be testing the game at 4k
the vanilla version of the game as well
as the modified one of course and we're
just gonna see what kind of numbers we
get luckily I looked on the developer's
website and apparently you're only
supposed to expect about a 5 to 15 FPS
dip from the vanilla version so that's
actually not too bad considering how
much better the game looks with the mod
installed and I should also mention that
the mod does come with like a dozen or
so presets so there's of course the
redux the original preset which is the
one that we'll be testing today but
there's also like 11 or 12 other ones
that you can kind of swap out different
en B's kind of like having a bunch of
Instagram filters for your game for lack
of a better analogy so getting back to
the developer himself
Josh Romero is the guy who's stamping
his name on all this that's been created
here but I was reading a couple articles
that
surfaced this morning maybe it was
yesterday I'm not sure and apparently
there's some talk or controversy that he
may have used some stolen code from
other modders in the community without
giving them credit I haven't done any
research other than just reading a
couple articles online so I can't really
take a stance right now but I want to
just separate myself from that whole
that whole mess just because that's not
really what this video is about so just
bear that in mind if you did want to
like donate you know the developer and
support them just bear that you might
want to do some research first just to
make sure that this guy really is
responsible for this entire mod on that
notes I think we can probably dive right
into the benchmark I'm actually going to
show you guys a side-by-side comparison
of the in-game benchmark with you're
going to see vanilla on the left and the
redux mod on the right with frame rates
and all that sort of things so we're
gonna roll that and then I'm going to
get back to you with the performance
results and then maybe we'll actually
dive into the game not just do some
straight up you know pre pre run
benchmarks but actually play the game
and see how it does alright sound good
roll tape
all right a van so hopefully you guys
enjoyed that little comparison I thought
was pretty cool and obviously from the
naked eye it's pretty it's it's so clear
it's so clear how good how much better
the mod looks over this stupid stupid
vanilla version of the game however that
does come at a cost and that cost is
frame rates pitches so how did the two
compare to each other I'm sure you can
see the frame rate counters and stuff
well it's kind of hard to actually nail
down a precise average so the results
that I found was 71 FS with the vanilla
version and we saw 59 FPS on average
with the Redux modification so let's
write it right in there I mean that's
what ten eleven I can't do math right
now look at math but that pretty much
falls into the expected range that the
developer developer warned us about so
that's that's good quite frankly for how
good the game looks is really not that
bad of a performance it's you can see
the frame rate counter on the top left
corner right there we are getting around
50 60 FPS on average roll through the
streets trying to chase down the mark
and it's very playable
it's very playable it looks freaking
gorge of course but it's actually not
too bad haven't really seen too many
dips into the 40's that's when I start
to notice a little bit of chopped champ
you know I'm saying and forgive the
horrible driving right now I mean I
usually Drive horribly because of
half-asian but it's even worse right now
because like I said the dev has also
done some vehicle handling tweaks so
this car does not function like it
usually does I wish I could show you
guys RAM usage of your own usage but I
can't because all the programs that I
try to monitor it with just end up
crashing the game because the mods just
it's a mod you know
just not I would say like I'd probably
probably think that you wouldn't be able
to run this at 4k unless you had a
similar setup as mine with 2gb of GTX
1080s
in SLI even with you know obviously
bonus points if you can get to Titan X
please in that biatch Bart pull that
shit like Jo because then you get a
little bit more be RAM as well plus
obviously the way faster performance so
um things are looking pretty good right
now oh I saw a dip into the 40's just
just for a brief moment there and holy
moly
I believe the cars also get destroyed I
mean the cars just get totally wrecked a
lot quicker in this mod as well I guess
now we're kind of diving into not just
the performance but just how the mod
plays how it handles but if you guys
were curious at all as to the graphics
that the graphic settings that I'm using
when we go ahead and take a look at that
the game the mod is known to crash here
and there in the menu settings at least
for in my experience it's get a little
choppy right now oh oh here we can see
the graphics 4k baby I've pay on I don't
know why I usually don't but NSAA is
that 2x also got cranked up all the
population density everything else is
pretty much maxed out shows on softest
fuction MSAA 2x OOP and yet maxed out
all around advanced graphics take a look
at that on on all the shadows extended
distance scaling I want trees popping
out at me put away so Oh YUM
that looks pretty much more or less
maxed out under than anti-aliasing which
again at 4k is a little bit gratuitous I
don't really think you need 4x NSAA
honestly I do a lot of my benchmarks at
that setting just because for comparison
I just want to push the hardware to its
limits
well that's practically speaking if
you're actually playing the game just to
play it probably don't need the extra
aliasing on there because everything's
already so smooth the resolution just
makes everything super straight all the
lines you have smooth those lines are
no idea I'm going to outrun the cops in
this piece of crap car look at it's like
a like a lunch box with wheels
maybe I'll just run them oh I have to
return the car fuck streets look so much
nicer
we'll look at the road the entire time
because it helps my FPS I also like how
the the Mater put the in real ads like
there's Pepsi on that truck it's just
roll around seeing all the trying to
find all the oh god of mica not what
lose the cops oh my god seriously if it
was a white guy driving if you run
people over slow enough they'll grab
onto the car see that guy grabbing these
old mob into your life oh yeah it's kind
of a fun feature we always need more
incentive to run over people
all the cars looks so shiny everyone in
this mod washes their car everyday like
if your cars in this condition you
should not like you should not be able
to pick up prostitutes like they should
not get in your car because even they
have standards right a similar turns
your car not a scratch on it
alright later come go FedEx I wonder if
this videos gonna get flagged for
copyright hope to god there's not a
Nintendo sign mission first good luck on
a figure if my life sucks living with my
shitty
aunt always doing aerobics stop smoking
home a pot Oh herro oh yes you got the
Audi you been to LD look at the ODI

fun at this point so I'm gonna cut it
off and let y'all go and enjoy the rest
of your day or evening what-have-you
hopefully you enjoyed this video I know
there wasn't too much data wasn't too
thick with information but I just kind
of want to show it off and see how how
awesome our gameplay experience could be
at 4k with this particular mod and those
two GTX 1080s of course if you guys
enjoyed the video be sure to toss me a
like on it and also subscribe to the
channel for more stuff that you're
really soon that's all for now guys I'm
