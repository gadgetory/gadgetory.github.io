that you said that the core 500 toaster
can fit full-sized video cards and AIO
liquid coolers but dude I can't even fit
the motherboard in the damn thing so
what's the deal so if that's not the
core 500 hippie huh don't Barney key
don't get it open up the core 500 from
fractal design provides top-class
cooling and supports full-sized hardware
in a compact design click the link in
the description to learn more bread
toasting only supported with AMD chips
what's up guys welcome back to the
channel this is part 2 of my very
impromptu mini series where I build and
test a potato PC essentially and that's
a bit misleading of a name for this rig
because it's not really a full PC as you
can see there's no case it's just lying
here on my table it's also a mishmash of
components some of which are potato and
some of them are definitely not the
reason why I called it a potato build is
mainly talking about the video card here
the geforce GT 610 it's a 45 ish dollar
video card and it's got two gigs of VRAM
ddr3 memory that is and I guess that's
kind of part of what this video is all
about is is a $45 video card even worth
it what can what kind of performance can
you expect to see in game and is
something like that even comparable to
let's say the onboard graphics in our
CPU here which is a G 32:58 from Intel
very nice dual-core overclockable
processor so it's definitely not potato
quality can still run some pretty some
pretty decent games however it's got
intel HD 4000 series graphics on it and
a lot of people in the comments are
saying well dude Kyle this video cards
probably not even as good as the the
onboard GPU and that in that CPU and
that's what we're here to test today
okay so if you guys haven't seen part
one of the
video go ahead and check that out make
sure you're sitting down for that one in
case you just didn't want to watch part
one for understandable reasons we are
working with some hardware here
including the asrock h 81 and
motherboard initially I thought you
could do some overclocking with this
board but it turns out that's the H 81 M
HDS I believe so no overclocking just
kind of goes right in with the potato
theme here we've got a four gig stick of
Ripjaws X memory ddr3 from g.skill and
we've also got some storage we've got a
WD black 2 terabyte and a crucial m4 SSD
64 gig the other thing that's certainly
not potato in this build is the power
supply it's a 650 watt earth Watts unit
from an Tek and it's a B+ platinum it
probably cost more than all these parts
combined I don't know if that's true but
I wouldn't be surprised again I just had
these parts lying around so that's why
they're in no means a recommendation of
parts you should get for a single system
but yeah that being said why don't we go
ahead and take a look at the benchmarks
because I did run some tests between the
intel HD 4000 series graphics on RG
32:58
against our GT 610 GPU so you're a
little bit far away why don't you get up
closer the monitor here oh okay so
I'm playing half-life 2 right now this
is the first game I tested in 1920 by
1080 this is the only game that
performed actually really well and was
very playable on both the integrated
graphics and our GT 610 where is this
guy die you a sucka you can see the
framerate counter courtesy of fraps in
the upper left corner there I might have
to go fullscreen or something but oh no
I'm out of ammo
oh no damn you damn you would but yeah
we got about average of 52 frames per
second on the integrated graphics and
then up to 88 on the our discrete GPU
there which is a nice bump actually a
bigger bump than I was expecting to be
honest and we saw that same trend
continued with the minimum and Max frame
rates as well so definitely very
playable which isn't too surprising
considering this is a really old game
using that old-school Source engine and
stuff but you know it's it's still
pretty nice that that you can play
half-life 2 with relative smooth
this Y is my crowbar punching bullet
holes into the wall this is weird the
next game I tested out was good ol
brawlhalla kind of like a rip on Super
Smash Brothers if you will very nice
game but I wanted to test out a couple
of these you know two-dimensional games
because I imagine that's the type of
title that people are going to be
playing if they decide to invest in one
of these video cards at that price point
what we found here was actually this
brothel was an anomaly out of all the
games I tested because it was the only
one where we saw it increased
performance drastically increased
performance with the with the Intel HD
400 for 4000 series integrated graphics
which I thought was pretty interesting
so I'm not sure that's just because the
GPU was doing something funky this is
just a CPU intensive game I'm not really
sure but at any rate the game was still
playable even with the GT 610 which got
about 30 frames per second on average 30
or 31 whereas the the intel HD 4000 saw
double that like I said 60 or almost 60
frames per second so but either way when
you're playing a game like this if it's
not like a 3d you know first-person
shooter or something like that you don't
really notice too much the frame rates
unless you're going dipping below 30
then it gets noticeably choppy but it
wasn't really doing that for me I was
hovering above 30 most of the time even
with the GT 610 and I would consider
this game also pretty playable if you
guys haven't figured it out yet
I am gaming with the integrated graphics
right now so the discrete card is not
installed just doing this little demo
here with our intel HD 4000 so the next
game on the list is lovers in a
dangerous space-time so very much like
brawlhalla this is a 2-d game not super
intensive and we go back to our original
trend here of seeing increased
performance with the discrete GPU we
went from 25 to almost 32 frames per
second which is a nice bump over the
Intel integrated graphics and gameplay
was fairly you know I mean like I said
like like with brawlhalla 30 FPS in a
game like this isn't that bad
especially if you're able to hit that
consistently so I would consider this
game very playable on on both the Intel
graphics and the discrete GPU getting
slaughtered right now I'm not really
playing any of these games I'm just
talking while sucking next up we've got
rocket League and unlike the last two
games you can actually change some of
the graphical settings here both
brawlhalla and lovers in a dangerous
space-time have lock settings so I
couldn't really mess around with that
however the last three games that we've
seen so far have all been 1920 by 1080
this one as well
the only title I had to crank the
resolution down was our neck our last
one but we'll get to that in a bit video
you can see I've got everything set to
performance didn't want to go high
quality otherwise it runs like potato
and we've got a 1920 by 1080 right there
so let's go ahead and try jumping into
game so as you can see frame rates are
very bad with the integrated graphics we
averaged about 19 FPS with also you know
horrible min and maxes all around
however we did get a nice bump from
using that GT 610 and it actually was
much more playable with the discrete GPU
that I think that's probably the this is
the game where I noticed the biggest
difference in gameplay over all the
others so yeah and just look how bad
rocket League looks I didn't even know
it could look this bad is that even
possible
this is I mean still better than xbox
one but I mean still come on guys the
last game I tested was good old chivalry
and I got chivalry like really badly
both both the Intel HD graphics and the
the discrete card struggled immensely
with this game and this was the only
game that I actually had to turn the
settings down to 720 and give you a
quick look here at the at the settings
we cranked it down to 720 and lowest
possible settings we could and still
just getting slaughtered on the frame
rates Oh getting slaughtered on my neck
hey hey oh geez I'm giving myself a
that's not right but yeah this game I
would not call this playable as you can
see 17 18 frames per second even with
the
which we call it even with the discreet
card you with the higher slightly higher
frame rates still not playable because
this is not this is a 3d FPS game and
you can really notice the difference in
choppiness here going with with the low
frame rates so before I embarrass myself
anymore let's just up to late all right
my brothers and sisters so what can we
take away from today's testing if
anything at all well for starters I can
confidently say now that I've run the
benchmarks that the GT 610 does
outperform the intel HD 4000 series
graphics in most games there was one
game brawlhalla where it was complete
backwards but I'm not sure why for the
most part you are gonna see some
performance increase with getting a GPU
like this however the performance
increase isn't that great in some games
more than others for sure
but especially due to the nature of
games that you might be playing on a
system like this a lot of to 2d games in
particular you're not gonna notice a
huge difference in those extra frames
for example with brawlhalla and what was
the other game that I tested lovers in a
dangerous space-time I couldn't tell the
difference between 30 and 60 FPS so
really making this upgrade wasn't really
doing anything for me and it was kind of
wasted money in those examples however
if you're doing something like rocket
League something more 3d or FPS even
like like chivalry then you will notice
a bit of a performance boost now is that
performance increase and gameplay
experience worth the forty-five dollars
that you pay for this thing No and
that's why I would not recommend anyone
buying a card like this or in this
caliber if you're really looking to
upgrade from intel HD 4000 series
graphics or something similar then just
fork out the extra this is already $45
just spend like $70 more and get
something like a gtx 750ti for example
because that's going to be so much
better than this thing and your money is
going to be so much more well-spent that
way as well you're going to essentially
open up a huge number of possibilities
when it comes to more games that you're
able to play at decent settings you know
with with a 750ti you can pretty much
play
oh you can play a lot of titles at 1080
on medium to high settings and you know
triple-a titles you can crank the
settings down to make them playable as
well even at 1080 whereas this you're
not playing any triple-a titles I don't
care if you're you know gaming at 240p
it's just not gonna happen
doesn't have the the bandwidth or the
speed so um on that note
ya don't buy this that's the moral of
this story don't buy this just just get
something better and you will be all the
more happy for it so that's pretty much
gonna conclude it for this little mini
PC potato potato PC thing series part
video YouTube yes
but hope you but hopefully you guys
enjoyed it go ahead and toss me a like
on the video if you did and feel free to
leave me your thoughts on all of this
all of these findings in the comments
below I'm curious to hear what you guys
have to say about these numbers and yeah
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already I'll see you guys in the next
video really soon have a good day I love
you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
