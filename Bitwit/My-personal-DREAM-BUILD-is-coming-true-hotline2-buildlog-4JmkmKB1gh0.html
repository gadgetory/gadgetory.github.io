build log for hotline two I'm actually
gonna get some stuff installed and ready
for water cooling inside of the fantex
involve ex over here but unfortunately
we're not gonna get around to bending
any tubes today because I encountered a
last-minute issue so you see the pink in
the custom sleeves here right and then
you compare that to the pink fluid that
used to be in the original hot line very
different this is almost like a fuchsia
there's more purple to this and this is
just like a straight hot neon pink oboes
I looked online I could not find a
single fluid that came anywhere close to
this color they all more or less look
like this however I did find some primo
chill colored tubing in UV pink that
matches the pink in our cables very
closely so I'm kind of leaning that way
now and having colored tubing instead of
colored liquid which is gonna obviously
change the overall look of the system
immensely but I think it might be kind
of cool and I'm willing to at least try
it out not to mention using good old
fashioned distilled water that doesn't
clog up your pipes like a big turd is a
huge bonus
but what kind of sucks about this pink
tubing is that a I don't have it yet so
it's gonna take a few days to get here
and be it only comes in the skinnier
size with an outer diameter of 12
millimeters whereas this stuff and the
fittings that ek sent me are compatible
with 16 millimeter outer diameter tubes
so I'm going to wait for ek to send me
some more fittings assuming that they
want to do that and of course I'll have
to wait for the pink tubing to arrive
before I can actually get bending so I'm
sad to say there won't be any tube
ending in this video but it's still
gonna be pretty fun we get to slap on
the other GPU block for our r-tx 2080 TI
you can see you've already got one of
them done here we're gonna get our 9900
k installed into our slightly modified
motherboard which looks very lovely
except with a couple minor blemishes
from from not masking it a hundred
percent this is uh this is why pea sauce
is doing I'm just gonna throw under the
bus because I'm her husband that's what
they do we're gonna fix this velocity
RGB block onto the board like so look at
just how it just looks so seamless it
looks like it's part of the board the
design language from both these pieces
are so in tune with each other it looks
great maybe we'll get some cables
connected and also the radiator and fans
you can see I spray-painted the
radiators in a light grey trying to
match the the color of the sleeving here
and I actually think it turned out
pretty nice my spray painting skills are
definitely improving they're not a
hundred percent dry it hasn't been a
full 24 hours yet so that's why they're
resting kind of in mid-air on on some
camera lenses but they look really good
can't wait to get them fitted inside the
case as well we've got the thicker
thirty eight millimeter radiator going
top with three fans in in push those are
gonna be the ll1 20 series RGB fans from
corsair and then we have our slightly
thinner 27 28 millimeter thick radiator
that's gonna go at the front of the case
along with our pump res combo that's
gonna mount sort of like this straight
to the radiator it's probably gonna be
like I don't know maybe like this with a
with a longer tube of course to fill up
some of that dead space up top so that's
the plan we're gonna try to get all this
hardware that I just showed off
installed today so that when the tubes
and the fittings come in we're ready to
go and start bending and also once all
this stuff goes inside the case we'll
actually be able to see where all the
parts are positioned in relation to each
other giving us a better idea of how
we're gonna go about doing our runs so
stay tuned to the end of the video maybe
you guys can give me some suggestions
but that should be a lot of fun let's
get her done
all right here is what I got so far
looking pretty darn good man I'm really
diggin it there are a couple things to
note however for example you might have
caught while I was installing the water
block on the 28 ETI that it's not
actually a 28 e TI water block it's
rather an RT X 2080 block that ek sent
me by mistake and I didn't realize that
until I had fully mounted it onto the GP
I don't think it's an issue because I'm
pretty sure that both these blocks are
machined the same way I think the
difference just lies in the user's
manual because you know there's a
different number of memory chips -
perhaps the thermal pad positioning is a
little bit different but I emailed ek
I'm waiting on the response just to
double confirm apart from that I've got
some fractal venturi HP 12 fans at the
front here for our front radiator very
nice and in case you're curious we get
about two to three millimeters of
clearance between our Revo D 5 pump and
the actual water block for our 2080 TI's
it's it's very very close the tail on
the motherboard matches the cables
perfectly now that we have some decent
studio lighting in here it actually
looks really close I do have to go over
and touch up some areas that were missed
on the spray paint you can kind of see
some of the reflective material behind
the paint there that just wasn't masked
off fully properly it's not a huge deal
shouldn't be too difficult to fix
it's also worth noting that this is not
necessarily the final envy link SLI
bridge that I'll be using I may very
well swap this out with something with a
little more Flair down the line we'll
just have to wait and see now this is
the stock reservoir tube that came with
the pump res combo and I was planning to
actually swap it out with a 204
millimeter tall one but that's
definitely not gonna happen because in
order to do that I would have to mount
the pump way down here at the bottom
that the bottom fan mount on the
radiator which is not possible now that
I can see that there's a power supply
shroud in the way so this little guy
will have to do it actually ended up
being the perfect height because it
leaves us just enough clearance for the
tubes that'll be going in and out of
this radiator on a final note I want to
point out that there's gonna be a lot
more pink in the finished product than
what you see here it kind of looks like
teals taking over at the moment that's
just because we don't have the tubing or
the coolant in which is going to be pink
so obviously pink is still gonna be a
very prominent color this is hot line
after all I just thought I'd reassure
any of you who are freaking out over the
abundance of team now let's talk about
bends there's a lot of different options
and my head's kind of spinning I
literally just started thinking about
this five minutes ago so by no means is
the path I'm about to share with you
guys a
set in stone option I'm just sort of
spitballing here this is sort of my my
first impression of how things could
look potentially and obviously you guys
are free to give me some advice
suggestions in the comet that's always
appreciated so here we go we got the
pump right here right I was thinking is
maybe we can come out here just kind of
hug the the back plate of the GPU and
then just go straight in straight into
the GPU and we're gonna go boom with two
tubes essentially cooling these GPUs in
parallel out the top card straight back
left and straight up into the BRM
heatsink and then from there it's gonna
come out here straight to the left
straight up into the radiator out of the
radiator straight down all the way to
the right and then back into the CPU
water block tube comes straight out of
the block straight up and then a hard
right into the radiator and then here I
was thinking maybe we could go straight
down perhaps behind the pump pres and
then come out from underneath and
straight back in might be kind of tricky
but I think it's doable so I did a quick
and dirty mock-up of that path I just
described and I really only drew the
tubes that I think are gonna be the most
visible from from this perspective so
obviously not every tube is represented
here but that's sort of the lay of the
land and I'm not exactly sure how I feel
about it just because again I haven't
really given this too much thought so
far and it's really just hard to
visualize because some of these tubes
are more in the foreground than others
and it's just really hard to see get a
sense of depth of how this is all
actually gonna look in person so once I
get the the tubes in I can start playing
around with it get a better idea and
again this is all subject to change so
guys please share your thoughts and
suggestions in here you know I'm a water
cooling new but I've only done this a
handful of times so I can use all the
help I can get and thus concludes what I
would consider the first real build log
for hot line - I am super excited to get
this under way finally and I'm looking
forward to sharing the rest of it with
you guys feel free to get subscribed if
you haven't yet so you don't miss part 2
coming up very soon until pretty jesus
everything's fine be sure to smash that
like button if you enjoyed the video
guys that helps a lot thank you so much
for watching have a good one and I'll
see you all in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
