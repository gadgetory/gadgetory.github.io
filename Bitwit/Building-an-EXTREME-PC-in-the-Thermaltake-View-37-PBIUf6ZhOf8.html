the drop before it's gone what's going
on guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well today we're taking
a look at this brand new case from
thermaltake this is their view 37 RGB
which actually includes three of their
140 millimeter RGB ring fans each of
these fans MSRP s-- for about 30 bucks
so we're talking about $90 worth of fans
here included right out of the box which
probably explains partially why the MSRP
on this case is 169 US dollars and today
we'll be taking a look to see if it's
worth exactly that so right off the bat
it seems to me that Thermaltake is kind
of focusing on two main components for
this case the first one being water
cooling there's a ton of support which
we'll talk about in just a moment and to
just the ability to look inside of your
system and appreciate all of the innards
that's why we have this ginormous
acrylic panel that sort of spans the the
left side and top side of the case which
we'll talk about more in a moment
but the plan for today is to briefly
talk about the exterior of the case then
we'll work our way inside with the
internal layout we'll do a quick time
lapse build I'll briefly talk about my
experience with that and then we'll
finish things off with a quick thermal
test with the front panel on and off to
sort of gauge the delta between
temperatures for primarily our CPU and
GPU so starting at the outside of the
case we have a really solid construction
it's a steel frame it seems very well
built and we also have acrylic kind of
on the front and on the side here
starting with the front side it's pretty
much just flat acrylic and it looks
really nice it could probably pass for
tempered glass if it weren't for the
little micro scratches I've been very
careful with this case ever since I
unboxed it a few hours ago and still it
seems there's there seems to be freaking
scratches all over it somehow so that's
one thing that you have to bear in mind
with acrylic if you're not ok with
little scratches on the outside of your
case then maybe this is
the one for you but apart from that it
does seem well-built there's no
imperfections in the actual acrylic it's
it's very smooth looking there's no
weird warps or anything like that the
front panel is also to me it seems a
little bit starved for airflow which is
another reason why I want to test
thermals at the end of this video
you do get ventilation on either side
here with some nice mesh if you wanted
to dust that off once it gets all masked
you can just pop the front panel off and
use some compressed air or whatnot but
the ventilation here seems somewhat
limited just because the fans that are
pre-installed here are mounted on the
outside of the steel frame and the
blades are resting up pretty close
against that front acrylic panel which
makes me wonder if it's being if those
fans are being starved for airflow so
we're gonna take a closer look at that
later because I just don't know if this
is gonna cut it at the very front at the
top of the case you get your front panel
connectors including a nice big power
button a small and discreet reset button
which I like two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0
ports your mic and headphone jacks as
well all very accessible right there in
the middle of your case additionally you
have this giant panel this is sort of
where it gets its view name I would
imagine because you have this single
piece of acrylic that sort of spans the
the entire left side and the top of your
case kind of has this nice curve right
here giving a 90-degree Bend and it
allows you to just look inside of your
case from either angle either from the
side or from the top view which is which
is pretty cool
the downside here is for one that the
way they have this actually installed
they have two thumb screws one big one
at the bottom one big one at the top but
then there's also this plastic plate at
the back that has four additional screws
which are just more you know
conventional like power supply screws
with Philips head threads on them so you
pretty much have to do undo six screws
if you want to get the side panel off
which i think is a little overkill if
you're gonna be using this as a daily
and you're not moving it around much
then I would probably just remove this
plastic panel and just keep the two big
thumb screws on there that should
suffice in keeping the panel in place I
mean it's it's it's acrylic after all a
nut glass it's not very heavy at all
despite the way it looks
additionally since this is just all
acrylic at the top here there's no place
to mount any fans or radiators so that
begs the question where's the exhaust
taking place in this case if not for
just this single 140
later fan and to where are you mounting
additional fans and radiators for all of
that water cooling support I just
mentioned for starters you do have a
couple mounting options at the front of
the case you can do up to a three
hundred and sixty millimeter rad you can
also mount a couple one one forty s so
if you want to do a two eighty
millimeter radiator you could do that
there's also options for two two hundred
millimeter fans which looks very nice I
did see a demo of that at the
thermaltake suite at the at CES this
year so you have plenty of mounting
options at the front there and once we
take a look at the inside of the case
I'll show you the additional radiator
and fan mounting areas take a look at
the back of the case you kind of see
what I mean here with the two large
thumb screws and the four little screws
with the plastic bracket holding that
giant acrylic panel in place and then
we've also got our 140 millimeter rear
exhaust fan here on flexible mounting
strips looks like you can also mount a
120 here and lower or raise that as you
see fit here's a cutout for your IO
shield for the motherboard you get one
two three four five six seven eight
expansion slots and traditional
horizontal setup and you have two more
that are vertical if you want to mount a
up to a 2.5 slot card vertically in this
case you could do that it does come with
the metal bracket but it does not
include a riser cable so that you'll
have to purchase that separately
unfortunately this is all held in place
with thumb screws that goes for all
these expansion slots as well some to
bear in mind with most vertical GPU
mounts in the case like this is that you
might sacrifice some thermal performance
if you're cooler especially with just a
simple air cooler is brushing up against
the side panel here then it probably
will be a little bit starved for airflow
you've also got a power supply cut out
here no removable bracket just a simple
cutout you can feel some rubber pads in
here for reduced noise and vibration
there is a dust filter for your power
supply it is removable from the rear of
your case pulls out just like that it's
fairly long which indicates that we
might have a fan mounting point at the
bottom of our case which we'll take a
closer look at in just a moment but very
easy to remove and replace just to give
it a quick dusting to make sure that
everything
is properly ventilated and I'm at a
funny angle right now so I just just get
a moment ere we go
and then lastly at the back here we have
two captive thumb screws for our right
side panel I should mention that the
other thumb screws for the large acrylic
panel are not captive that would have
been nice to see all right so let's pop
off this acrylic panel here and take a
closer look inside the case so once you
have all the screws and the plastic
bracket removed popping it off is pretty
simple kind of just push it push it back
and then you lift like so ah see single
giant piece of acrylic that will surely
get scratched
under any conditions so be very careful
so here we are inside the case couple
things to note right off the bat we can
support up to e-atx ports in here plenty
of space for that and all the way down
to mini ITX if that's something you want
to do the first thing I notice that is
that there's plenty of cutouts for
cables you get to at the top here six on
the right which minds you these three
right here on the inside are probably
gonna be covered up with it a
traditional ATX motherboard we've also
got two more cutouts down here for your
front panel connectors and things like
that only the the the grommets are only
the the cutouts on the right of the
motherboard are grommeted however I
would have liked to see these to at
least be grommeted especially with the
acrylic top panel that you can see
through from that angle I mean there's
no radiator or fans to cover up these
two holes so I felt at the very least
given the design of the case that
Thermaltake would have provided some
grommets at the top here just for an
overall cleaner look so that's a bit of
a bummer but what can you do also
there's one two looks like there's about
six pre-installed standoffs which is
kind of weird if you wanted to install
an ATX board you'd still have to install
three standoffs right here so they kind
of did half the job for you interesting
and then here's your vertical bracket
for a GPU easily removable with with a
couple screws here we also have a look
at our bottom area where we can see now
very much more clearly without any
reflection that this does not have a
power supply basement which is going to
be an issue for some people because
that's such a common thing to see in in
lots of cases these days but at the same
time it might
just work out well the design design
language of this case the whole idea
here is that you want to be able to see
every component in your rig and you want
to show it off in its entirety
especially you know if you're gonna go
with a thermal take power supply with
like an RGB fan on it and stuff and
you'll you're not gonna want to hide
that out but again it's gonna be a deal
breaker for some people or not very
desirable for others so something to
bear in mind oh I almost forgot to come
back to this it does look like we have a
couple mounting areas for either a pair
of one 20s or one 40s from the looks of
it at the bottom of our case here you
can even slide one of those fans
underneath the drive cage or your
graphics card of course that also
explains why our power supply dust
filter is so long we had a hard drive
cage that can support three two and a
half inch or three and a half inch
drives they are toolless and removable
so you kind of just pinch the sides here
to pull it out I shouldn't say
completely tool is because you do stop
to screw this the drive in with physical
screws and whatnot but they're made of
plastic they're not the most durable
looking they look kind of cheap but they
actually feel a bit sturdier than they
look so I guess that's not an issue I
wouldn't imagine that these are gonna
break on you anytime soon or anything
like that so there's three of those
there's more drive mounting options at
the back of the case behind the
motherboard tray which we'll take a look
at later it also looks like this cage is
removable in fact it would have to be if
you wanted to mount any fans or
radiators to the other radiator mounting
spot that I was alluding to earlier
which is to the right of the motherboard
right here you can do up to a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator or
triple 120 fans now as you might have
guessed since we do have a radiator
mounting position right here there is
ample ventilation on the backside panel
which I didn't show you guys earlier ton
of ventilation slots with a magnetic
dust filter that's easily removable you
do have to take the side panel off in
order to remove it but it seems to be a
proper way to exhaust any hot air coming
out of that radiator or fans whichever
you choose to put there so from what I
can tell so far and judging from the
showpieces that Thermaltake had of this
case at their CES suite this year is
that this is gonna be a really popular
spot for a radiator most people are
probably gonna want to show off their
rad fans if they're RGB and stuffed and
looks all nice and pretty to be acrylic
they're gonna want a mountain radiator
right here which means they're gonna be
relying on these
intake fans to sort of deliver healthy
airflow to the radiator otherwise their
CPU temperatures could likely suffer the
question that we'll answer later today
is are these front intake fans being
choked too hard in order to provide that
airflow efficiently so we'll take a look
at that later on and how that affects
GPU temperatures as well and that sort
of thing but for now let's pop off the
right side panel here and take a look
behind the motherboard so taking a look
at the back of the case here we have
plenty of room for cable management it
seems like we actually have about an
inch maybe an inch and a quarter of room
between the motherboard tray itself and
the side panel so lots of room for
wiring you also notice that we have one
two three four removable trays that are
held in place by a single thumb screw
each of these trays can house either a
single three and a half inch mechanical
hard drive or two two and a half inch
drive so you can do eight SSDs back here
or four mechanical drives which is
pretty sweet however bear in mind that
if you're mounting a radiator or a fan
in this area right here against the
motherboard tray then populating these
trays with drives might not be the best
idea because that'll probably block a
lot of the exhaust coming off of that
cooling solution so bear that in mind
and even if you do populate the rest of
the trays there's still plenty of cable
cable routing area right here in the
middle of the case
lots of tie-down points again just a lot
of clearance between the tray and the
side panel so cable management looks
pretty good it looks pretty promising in
a case that doesn't even have a power
supply basement where you can just kind
of shove all that stuff down there but
of course we'll verify all that once we
do the build momentarily now before we
dive into the build I wanted to quickly
talk about the lighting accessories that
come included with this case for
starters we have two lighting
controllers this one right here is say
the power thank God it's not molex
you've got a couple connectors actually
three connectors for your RGB ring fans
and some LED ins and outs you've got
connecting points if you wanted to wire
this up to your motherboard it does
support Asus MSI and gigabyte so that
you can interface with their RGB
software so you can have the lighting on
your fans match the lighting on your
motherboard on your GPU and so forth
or you can just simply leave it hooked
up to the controller and you've got
different
for fan speed lighting mode color mode
and light speed this does not make your
computer run at light speed rather it
controls the speed of various lighting
effects and then you've also got another
controller here in the form of a PCI
expansion bracket which is actually
pretty cool has all the same buttons
that this one does except you can access
it from the outside of your case you
don't have to store it inside you do
have to fish around back there if you
want to reach the buttons but it's kind
of nice that thermal takes giving you
several options for connecting and
controlling your lighting so on that
note folks let's go ahead and dive into
a quick little time-lapse and then we'll
circle back talk about how it all went
before doing some thermal testing
all righty the build is done and it is
lit literally literally lit okay I'll
just stop trying but it looks good it
looks really good it looks a lot nicer
than I thought it would be honest you
know what works here is it since this
that the top panel is acrylic it allows
just the lighting in your environment to
shine through the top of your build and
sort of just kind of create a nice
natural lighting environment for your
components whereas you know
traditionally you only have a side panel
and you're getting sort of light at a
weird angle you know if you've got like
lights in the ceiling and stuff like
that
there's a lot of shadows and and doesn't
look as properly lit as it does in this
case so that's that's really nice but
this is also not very good for being on
camera because of reflections and stuff
so I'm actually gonna remove the panel
before I continue on with how the build
went for me so give me a sec I guess
I'll just start in sort of the order
that I installed things with the
motherboard very straightforward pretty
simple process I did have to install
those three thumb screws that
Thermaltake gypped me on they also
didn't or maybe I just didn't see it but
I did not find a Phillips head to hex
adapter to install the three standoffs
which was kind of frustrating so I just
ended up tightening them with with a
little wrench that I had I have the
adapter as well but I just used the
wrench because it was nearby but that's
weird I think that should be included if
you're not gonna pre install all of the
standoffs the drive cage obviously had
to get removed there were a couple thumb
screws as I thought that we're located
behind the motherboard tray very easy to
remove just standard Phillips head
screws pop the drive cage out as well as
the platform there were two screws at
the bottom of the case so I had to play
it on the side to get that platform out
and that was no problem the mounting
situation for a radiator if you're gonna
mount one right here there is like
flexible mounting strips but they're
very short strips so there's not a lot
of play where you can put the radiator
you can either put it like smack-dab in
the middle at least for a 240 rad like
you see here smack-dab in the middle or
way up top but then you're kind of
blocking this this cutout at least with
the the fractal or that I have here the
Celsius s 24 since it's got you know
your tubing
you're mounting it at the very top
wasn't ideal because you I was then
covering this cutout
and it was like interfering with the
cables or you can put it way down at the
bottom but then you know the tubing kind
of goes over the the GPU and it doesn't
look all that graceful so middle mount
seem to be the best option for me
especially since it's pretty close to
these front intake fans here which you
can't really get a good look at here
maybe I'll throw some b-roll in for you
the other thing is that the motherboard
tray is actually covering up a lot of
the the radiator grille behind it so it
doesn't look like a whole lot of air is
being exhausted I mean granted some
certainly is but I feel like it could
just be a little bit more open the other
thing that I'll mention is that our
graphics card here is a gtx 1080i from
EVGA this is the for the win 3 I believe
and it's a pretty lengthy card I think
it's like around 11 inches maybe I'll
put it somewhere in the video but that's
about as long as I would go if you're
planning to install a radiator where I
have because otherwise you run into
clearance issues so you want to bear
that in mind
routing out with cable management it was
actually a pretty awesome experience in
this case surprisingly I'm so spoiled I
feel with power supply basements now
just shoving everything in there that I
was like oh I wonder how this is gonna
go this is more of a you know an
old-school way to route cables just
behind your motherboard tray it was
actually plenty of room back there like
I mentioned over an inch between the
motherboard tray in that right side
panel so tie-down points where all we're
all very smartly placed so I used three
or four of those and just so much room
to spare granted I didn't mind any
drives back here the only drive I
installed maybe saw in the time-lapse
was an end up to SSD straight onto the
motherboard so I don't have to fiddle
with that but I feeI figure Drive
installation in this case is gonna be
pretty straightforward nothing really
new or uncharted there so altogether I
mean the cabling looks great the case
looks great everything put together I
did install the LED controller obviously
to hook up our three ring fans and there
are a couple different lighting modes
and and other cool things that it can do
so let me show you that really quick
okay so we're running the system full
throttle at the moment it's under a
stress test combination of Unigine
heaven' 4.0 and a 264 so that we were
taxing the CPU and the GPU
simultaneously it's been running for
about 20 minutes on this stress test
without the front panel so just bear
front fans these fans are at a fixed RPM
so they won't be fluctuating rpm based
on you know the temperature changes and
things like that so there's no variation
from test to test and our temperatures
on both processors have pretty much
maxed out at this point it's been about
10 minutes or so since I've seen them
get increasingly hot so right now our
packages at a maximum of 78 degrees
Celsius is the hottest that got on our
7900 X and it's actually right now it's
it's hovering around the 70 degree mark
you know give or take a few degrees so
it's actually not too bad at all then on
our GPU we're maxing out at 63 degrees
Celsius with you know it's sort of
fluctuating based on the scenes that are
in Unigine Heaven 4.0 what is happening
right now but it's mainly I don't know
what this is I don't I honestly don't
know what's happening right now ignoring
this we're getting 78 C max on the
package for the CPU and 63 degrees
Celsius on our GPU this must be a
Windows Update roll sabotage stupid
Windows 10 update assistant so what
we're going to do now is pop on the
front panel and wait another 10 to 20
minutes before rechecking the temps and
seeing how much hotter it gets all right
so we're about 20 minutes later into our
stress test here now with the front
panel fastened and secured and you know
what we're actually in pretty good shape
we only went up three degrees on our CPU
going from 78 to 81 degrees C which is a
lot better than I expected to be honest
it looks so closed off on the front here
but the numbers are proving otherwise
and maybe that's just how I've
configured the radiator and fans to be
right next to the intake fans
so whatever fresh air is being pulled in
is going straight through the radiator
fins and it's it's doing a great job and
that goes double for the GPU we've only
went up one degree Celsius going from 63
to 64 so altogether guys it's looking
it's like if like thermals in this case
aren't really an issue at the front end
good stuff all around good you up there
we'll take and we can close out this
video hey I'm just gonna end it right
here guys I'm not gonna go back to the
egg-cam where Lissette looks all nice
and stuff because it's late and wifey
sauce is waiting on me but i just wanted
to say that two thumbs up for this case
the price is a little steep granted but
if you're gonna want some blingy fans
that perform well and are very quiet
mind you anyway then I mean it's 90
bucks worth of fans here so I guess you
just kind of decide for yourself if it's
worth it in that sense water cooling
supports great I would've liked to see
type-c on the front panel for a hundred
and seventy dollar case but what can you
do and the thermals seem to be just fine
so yeah and it's quiet it's really quiet
especially because you know the
ventilation is on the right side of the
case so especially if we gonna be
putting this to the right side of your
desk then you'll probably hear it a lot
less than a traditional chassis that has
its exhaust on the top you know what I
mean because it'll it literally be
further away from you and there will be
a whole computer tower in between you
and the exhaust noise that makes sense
so I don't know guys let me one let me
know what you think I'm pretty impressed
with it to be honest and I love to hear
