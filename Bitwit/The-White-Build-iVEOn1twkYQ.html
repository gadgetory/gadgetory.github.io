welcome back to the channel today I am
assembling the long-awaited white build
that I've been promising you and teasing
you guys with on social media and
whatnot for the last few weeks now in
fact it's been so long since I first
teased this bill that some of you have
even questioned whether or not it's
still happening but lo and behold today
is the day where I finally put the damn
thing together the essential purpose of
this is just to make a really
cool-looking all-white themed build so
I've carefully hand-picked all the
components to be white or at least
somewhat match with the overall theme
and it is going to be a gaming system so
strictly just for games all the games
and not not much else other than games
because because games so let's take a
look at the products shall we starting
off with our CPU our heart and soul of
this system we've got the core i5 6600 K
so we are rockin skylake again no no
hyper threading here we are just going
to be gaming so we don't really need the
hyper threading all that much could help
here and there but for the most part
this is going to be solid cut cost down
a little bit by going with the core i5
still a very respectable CPU and housing
that guy will be the z170 deluxe from
Asus incredible motherboard by the way I
did a review of this you can go ahead
and check it out there are you know
there are motherboards out there that do
have white PCBs just to make it a little
bit more glammy and matchy-matchy but as
far as skylight goes I couldn't really
find any great options and this board
will have to do what am I saying this
board will have to do this is an amazing
board and anyone should be lucky and and
joyous to be using it in a system also
cooling the CPU will be this airmax ets
t40 fit white cluster I also did a
review of this it's got all white
painted heat sink thermal conductive
paints by the way so you're not going to
impede any kind of thermal dissipation
with it excellent cooler you can go
ahead and check out the review its I
really like it it's just one of what
what better cooler than this one to be
in an all-white build honestly so that
will be pretty sweet
by the way the fans are also strung with
white LEDs so that could be extra blingy
we've also got some Rando here is the
black sheep of the system if you will
haha you see what I did there
because they're not white at all they're
actually black because there are really
no great white heat spreader options for
ddr4 that is skylake rated so I went to
ended up going with these vengeance lpx
the low profile Edition grande this is
somewhat of a white and black themed
build I guess I can't say it's all white
because as you can see from the case
here it does have some black accents
more on the case later so this should
blend in just fine there's some yellow
on the sides but when it's installed
you're not really going to be seeing it
just the white Corsair logo on the front
which looks rather nice also these are
3,200 speed which is super blazing fast
super kick-ass Ram and this is 16 gigs
so we've got 4 by 4 gigabyte
configuration they're moving on to
storage we've got a tude here 2 terabyte
WD black and a samsung yo 250 gig SSD
both really great drives I've been using
these for a lot of builds lately just
because they're tried-and-true I have
gotten some good use out of them
honestly you won't be seeing much of
them because we'll be in the drive cages
but somehow they did manage to end up
matching the overall theme by being
black and white at least at least a
little bit their power supply I've got a
fractal design Newton 600 watt this
should be enough to drive our whole
system
honestly this is an older power supply
unit I use it for all I have used it in
in the past few for the past few years
for a lot of testing but it's still a
really good unit 600 watts is enough it
is semi modular of course we don't have
we do have these ugly ketchup and
mustard cables shame for shame but we
will be using some extensions as you'll
see so before you get an aneurysm don't
worry too much about that awesome little
power supply and you want to really even
be seeing it much because of the power
supply shroud of this case which by the
way is in enthu lux from fantex
beautiful case the white edition I
honestly forgot that they had a white
Edition till I was researching chassis
for this particular build and came
across this guy it's just absolutely
stunning in white I think it looks even
better in white then it doesn't black I
really love it also because it does have
a white painted interior you see a lot
of white cases these days that still
have a black painted interior but this
one's like matte fantex is like neck
paint that white we also have some
some extra case fans that we're gonna be
replacing with the current ones not that
there's anything wrong with these ones
these one 40s but we have three more one
40s here also from fantex that have
white
these in them so again we're just going
for like all tricked-out super white and
glam II some of you guys are going to
hate it when it's all done but I think
it's going to look pretty sweet and just
to glam it up a little bit more we do
have a fan text branded LED kit now this
is actually intended it's a white LED
kit of course it's actually intended as
an upgrade kit of sorts for the enthu
Lux for this particular case so it's
going to be just long enough to go
pretty much all the way around the
inside of the case to give a really nice
even coat coat of light which I'm really
excited to see the finished product and
of course we've got these white
extension sleeves sleeve cables that I
was mentioning before for our 24 pin ATX
as well as PCIe cables that will be in
our video card which I'm going to get to
at the end these are from silverstone
now these are just as good i would say
you know right on par with the BitFenix
alternatives because they have a really
solid fabric construction our material
just like the BitFenix ones and there's
also no heat shrink which I do
appreciate
so uh that should serve us well and then
lastly I don't think I mentioned this
before I glazed right or I grazed right
over it this is the galaxy GT X 980 Hall
of Fame Edition a super super duper
duper white card does have a titanium
backplate it's a bit silver there but
altogether a beautiful card it's it's
also one of those aesthetics that you
either love it or hate it personally for
this build I think it's going to look
absolutely perfect so also gtx 980 is
just just just kick-ass right there so
um that's pretty much it for all the
parts guys let me know what you think if
you think that you know i show swap
something out or like oh this this
choice was horrible i always like to
hear your feedback on this sort of thing
so let me know but other than that i
think it's think it's time to build this
damn thing don't you alright let's go
ahead and do that i'm gonna shut up now
alright here we go
Oh
you
all right boys and girls here is the
finished product in all of its glory
my my my does this look nice this is one
of the nicest builds I've ever made I've
ever built with my own tube man hands
it's freaking look at that just look it
just look
ah yeah it's good it's good guys it's
good look how clean that is gotta put
that flap down put your flaps down look
at that
so yeah this build was incredibly easy
and smooth because just the nature of
this case has excellent cable management
there's just so much room on both sides
of the motherboard tray that you really
just kind of plow through it if you know
what you're doing and everything just
looks so nice in here I mean at the
enter Mattox cooler fits perfectly the
only things that I would end like this
Hall of Fame card I mean there's a
little bit of sag but I mean not too bad
and the cables and the LED fans like
they're like doors so good the one thing
that I would change couple things two
things Lorain heat spreaders I wish they
were white we already went over that
briefly and I didn't I kind of overlooks
getting an eight pin extension for the
CPU up there a little bit of mustard
yeah a little bit of mustard up there Oh
send this guy in to pin my PC pronto so
yeah maybe I'll get one of those in the
future maybe even some front panel
extensions the bottom here even though
they're kind of easily overlooked might
just help everything sink together
everything just looks so nice and this
is the cool thing about all white
components especially in the case like
this where you have multicolored led
options watch this
hi I get sick of white just go over to
teal and everything in the case
magically looks teal as if it was
intended to be that color the whole time
or switch it up to a little blue
everything's blue now yeah I can't do
that very nicely with with like all red
components or even all black components
oh it just absorbs the color all these
white components just just reflect it
actually I'm going to go back to the
purple because purple might be my fave I
see this purple look at that look good
turn that actually gives Hotline a run
for his money
mmm baby by the way I almost forgot I
know some of you guys really like to see
verification that a newly-built system
is in fact working and does post
correctly so for those of you naysayers
or for those of you skeptics out there
we've got an HDMI cable let's go wait
let's follow it that's the that's the
keyboard cable where is it going see and
see how it's going over here I'm not
gonna cut I'm not gonna cut here we go--
wee-ooh
it's fun being a cable and then it goes
all the way in the back
hello again right there no other cables
know where the cables other than the
power cable I'm not gonna follow that
one cuz it's just ridiculous get
ridiculous that point but here you go
boom into the BIOS hosting yes you can
see there's our Samsung 850 Evo yeah
yeah motherboards 30 degrees Celsius
that's shy but that is gonna wrap it up
for now guys so go ahead and toss me a
like on this video if you enjoyed it
helps me a lot also feel free to pick up
an awesomesauce shirt while you're at it
and let me know in the comments what you
think of this build are you as impressed
by it as I am cuz cuz ha damn I'm David
uh grass looks real nice so yeah thanks
guys for watching this video and
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
