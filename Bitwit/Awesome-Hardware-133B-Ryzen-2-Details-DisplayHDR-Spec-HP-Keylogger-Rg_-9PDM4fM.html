show that Paul and I do every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right
here on twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
we also stream the show to our
respective YouTube channels we break it
the the entire episode into two halves
this week the first half was on Paul's
channel which has just happened so you
can go ahead and check that out in the
description below or you can go to the
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware if you
want to check that out side B is going
to be on my channel of course right here
on bit wit so thank you very much to all
of you who have just tuned in and those
of you who have stuck around since side
a we have a lovely half of the show
planned for you guys today and Paul is
gonna eat a bunch of popcorn while I
talk about tech news it's gonna be
exciting
you'll have never seen anything like it
your life will be forever changed it's
really good it's really good popcorn and
today's show is brought to you by
Vermont beer we have lots of beer from
Vermont and cider and cider and cider
it's not beer co cider has its own thing
so cheers to all of you who are drinking
at Holly's if you're of legal drinking
age we're happy to have you along
drinking with us this is a show where we
often swear or use adult language so if
you have little ones around
be sure to suffocate them with sand or
something um you know I mean circus and
sand isn't really a super precious
resource right now we have an abundance
as a cost effective very cost effective
way to suffocate the little ones um and
yeah that's pretty much it we sell
things on our stores which you can buy
objects off of in order to support us
like for example on my store bit Winx
slash store we have new things including
as you also hardware merch offer code
over 50 to save 10% on overs orders of
$50 or more yes or over 100 to save 20%
on orders of over 120 percent or more
guys so take advantage of these holiday
deals that we have going on the new Star
Wars awesome hardware Star Wars shirt is
beautiful this is a design by our very
own Brian maroc suit first shirt to
featuring our Ian hero on it I think
they did a great job it's still not a
pick I kind of want
one of with just just them here oh yeah
that'd be awesome if I might set that up
it's pretty adorable also we have new
mugs new mugs they're color mugs yes the
mugs are super nice quality we actually
have some in stock right here in the
studio the CPU cooler and the BIOS flash
sure the BIOS flash your mug looks to be
just one giant design that goes across
the whole thing whereas the CPU CPU
cooler is on both sides get one on
either side got a black handle white mug
Paul also has the zero insertion force
which looks awesome guys buy things buy
things from our stores it's a great way
for you to get awesome stuff while at
the same time supporting us so that we
have more money to pour back into the
channel buying bigger and better
products I don't know if this one is
even for sale anywhere do you guys want
to be ware of bottlenecks yeah I don't
think it is on sale I think that was
just a sample that we were sent by our
merch guy but I personally like it you
guys let us know what you think and Paul
store is Paul SmartNet I should I feel
so much and we're both selling mouse
pads yeah we're both selling mouse pads
this is the shorter smaller this is the
the short but like fatter one this is
the chod version there's also like a
long ding dong King Kong version that
spans the entire width of your desk or
you know so you can fit your keyboard on
top of it and stuff they actually look
really clean super clean high quality
stitched edging which does not seem very
friable
it's very nice rubber rubber backing and
the print job is fantastic
oh yeah you did you just railed that
mousepad you reeled it hard so guys by
stopping this is the this is how Paul
and I are able to afford crazy things
like the the pair of two terabyte 960
pros and via me assistants that I just
put the elite build that we're what
thirteen hundred dollars a piece because
you guys have been buying lots of stuff
from our merch stores um I just got an
invitation to via twitch affiliate did
you really awesome hardware I just got
invited to be a twitch affiliate
it's just this is not the same as a
partner that's a it's an affiliate is it
okay is that the same as being a twitch
partner I think this is automated you
needed at least five hundred twelve
minutes broadcast in the last thirty
days at least seven unique broadcasts in
the last thirty days an average of three
concurrent viewers are more over the
last thirty days and at least 50
followers that's hilarious any guys
we're taking the next step it's which
affiliate I don't know what that means
is it the same as partners or affiliates
like it's not like we're dating it's
like we're going out like it's
complicated it's like seeing each other
from time to time like if you were to
hook up with someone else it wouldn't be
that big a video that's kind of oh
that's a weird relationship term to use
though for people though like hey how
are things going with you and Amy we're
affiliated what does that mean when
you're like twitch we use the don't
language that many people that you deal
with you know in that way you've got a
you know you gotta introduce the
legalities to some I suppose what this
means potentially guys is that if we if
Paul and I get everybody moats or
affiliated soon then who knows we might
be able to actually give you guys some
like quality options when you're
watching our stream that would be nice
that would be nice for you guys and for
us because law oh yeah again there's too
much to never um so there's other
benefits that come along with being a
twitch partner for sure and it's just
really because Paul and I are both lazy
and they're in genetic it's why we have
an equation that's that coming in right
after oh we're streaming yeah but I mean
damn good on them for having an
algorithm that can automatically detect
like these people are streaming they get
lots of views and they're still not
partnered or affiliated we should send
them an email so good on you twitch you
guys are right on the money with that I
love you twitch but um thank you guys so
much again for watching and tuning in
let's go ahead and dive into some no
wait no I have a quick little
announcement
to announcements so um there's still a
giveaway going on for a full-blown
gaming PC yes so we got we did a huge
charity livestream on last Saturday and
we raised over $10,000 through extra
light for the Children's Hospital of Los
Angeles you guys you guys helped raise
over 10 grand which is absolutely insane
last year we hit about 3
thousand I think and we've nearly
tripled that yeah it's more than tripled
it's insane so Children's Hospital of
Los Angeles and because of beneficiary
yes and because of that we are doing an
epic giveaway we already gave away the
first system on stream that's already
done I'm gone with I've been in contact
with the winner for that but there's
still an entry level entry level in
quotes thread Ripper PC that's still
super high-end about eighteen hundred
and fifty two thank you super system yes
and we'll be announcing the winner for
that when Saturday or Sunday Sunday is
when it's on details so you guys have
another four days or so to enter this
yes the link is on my half if you go to
my half the little Paul channel
description you you need to click the
link to go over to the extra life page
in order to enter on the gleam do entry
yes you don't have to donate to the
extra life charity fundraising thing
that's not a raffle but you can if you
want this number could still go in
courier if you want to the other than
that though just feel free to enter and
it is we it is only open to North
America US Canada and Mexico though so
sorry to international people it's very
challenging for us to ship
internationally especially something
like a full-blown computer yeah but
there will be more international
giveaways coming soon and stuff too from
either of our channels the good way
we've also got a case giveaway a be
quiet sponsored case giveaway on my
channel this was actually announced
about a week ago you guys can win either
a dark base dark base 700 or dark base
Pro 900 both of which are freakishly
amazing cases I think Dimitri from
Hardware connects gave the dark base Pro
900 the case of the Year award last year
426 yeah and I totally stand by that so
these are both fantastic cases the the
dark base 700 is more recent it came out
like earlier this month or last month
it's got USB type-c on the front panel
it's a great case all around I did a
review on it you can check that out so
guys if you're interested in a new case
or if you're just looking to build the
new system and you're not exactly sure
where to start or you'd like a free case
just in general go ahead and sign up for
that so those are the only few
announcements that we have here but
let's dive in to some tech news we have
a lot to talk about
starting with Visa Visa and
announcement that they're gonna be
implementing a new display HDR
specification just in order to make the
display is more consistent with with
with consumer expectations and things
like that this is an article from the
verge Vasa is the standards organization
for displays most of you are probably
aware or familiar with their visa
mounting system that we see on the back
of TVs and monitors and things like that
a vase amount which I'm sure a lot of
people out there have heard of a
seamount but didn't know that vase is
actually an organization that handles a
lot of the spec and the specifications
and Riis standards all the standards for
these panels as well not just the
mounting mechanism per se but they do a
lot of a lot of good work over there at
visa the organization is now trying to
make HDR hardware including TVs panels
monitors and stuff like that more
consistent with its new certified
display HDR standards and this is gonna
help consumers know kind of what they're
getting when they buy a product with a
display HDR certification badge which
kind of looks exactly like what Paul is
showing up there it's being split into
into several tiers three tiers to start
there will definitely be more tears that
come later as the technology advances
and so forth but right now we've got
display HDR 400 600 and a thousand all
three levels are required to support the
open HDR 10 spec or standard in order to
receive the certification but the
similarities kind of seem to end there
in order to hit the display HDR 400
standard a display only needs to offer
global dimming and reach a peak
luminance of 400 Candela per meter
squared or CD / M squared which is a
sort of a metric that you guys see often
it's basically a standard unit of
luminance of brightness or etc aka this
is sort of like you know if you see
display HDR 400 it's basically the bare
minimum of what an HDR recipient would
benefit from so it's it's the bare
minimum it just it's you barely in the
door to HDR exposure but you know it's
not super high-end or anything display
HDR 600 bumps that requirement up
ever so slightly to a peak luminance of
600 CD / M Squared 10 bit image
processing that's actually pretty huge
and specifies a lower minimum black
level and higher color gamut of course
and then finally you've got the top end
for now
display HDR 10 1000 takes that to an
even higher 1000 CD / M Squared and
local dimming so I guess I guess what
I'm saying is we might actually be able
to check out some of these certified
display HDR monitors and panels perhaps
at CES would be kind of cool to actually
see those put into play and and kind of
see what they look like I would love to
actually see the same image on a 400 600
and 1,000 display HDR panel challenge
there's yep you can sell yeah exactly
yeah and I think that'd be a really
interesting sort of sort of content
piece but that that's what's happening
on the vase at end because HDR you know
HDR 10 it's it's I think a standard like
this needs to happen because HDR can be
plastered pretty much on any product but
it doesn't necessarily mean that you're
getting the same benefit or the same
experience or same image quality across
all those devices you could have HDR and
one and on one product and HDR on
another but they could be completely
varying levels of quality and and color
gamut to be honest so there's really a
huge need for a standardization for this
newer technology that's starting to
infiltrate all of our displays so thanks
BAE suffer for for making that happen
next up we've got an article from the
hacker news I should mention the last
one oh yeah I didn't say the last one
was from the bridge
this next articles from the hacker news
calm hacker news this is about an actual
security researcher claiming to a found
of built-in key logger
in several HP laptops and he it started
off as a tweet I guess just a tweet to
his followers then he went fully public
with his findings basically finding that
the key logger was found in several HP
laptops that would ascend
let hackers record your every keystroke
and steal sensitive data which is
obviously bad and this includes things
like passwords account info credit card
credentials I mean this is serious stuff
guys if someone wanted to hack you and
you've got an affected HP model laptop
laptop model that's you know that's
that's prone to this vulnerability it
could be seriously bad news this is long
happened at least two times this year
yeah from HP alone that's it's kind of
shitty it's not there this is buy build
your own computer yeah fire my own build
your own computer you'll have zero
bloatware and you want to deal with
like this all you have to worry about is
Microsoft's buying any key that bricked
the ultimate bloatware your operating
system the key logger was found in the
sin tp'ed system file which is a part of
synaptics touchpad driver damn it's
inept we talked about synaptics and
paul's half had nothing to do with this
but the synaptics touchpad driver is
apparently containing this system file
that has that is basically a key logger
and it ships with more than 460 HP
laptop models you probably have one of
them HP acknowledges that the key logger
exists and they say that it's a debug
trace which was accidentally left in
what a clusterfuck of an accident that
is oopsies sorry yeah well sorry doesn't
cut it for everyone especially those who
have been hacked but fortunately the the
the key logger has been removed with a
patch update the driver updates been
released for all the affected notebook
models you can visit the HP support
website in order to first first of all
to see which notebook models have been
affected and then you can get the driver
update from there as well
like Paul just mentioned this is not
HP's first offense with a key logger
vulnerability in May of this year in
fact a built-in key logger was found in
an HP Audio Driver that was silently
recording all of its users keystrokes
and storing them in a human readable
file so the story the story for the
manufacturer side is these are software
tools that they develop as the product
is being developed right because they
need to do troubleshooting and they need
to be able to track what happens so if
there is an error or a failure or
something like that they can look back
that correct what caused this and then
oops like it just happened to have
stayed in the software and we didn't go
and make it up to the servers a updated
version that purged that or whatever um
and it's up to you dear viewers at home
to decide whether or not your you
believe them in their story but um I
think we need to take a brief pause here
to fully appreciate that Kyle yeah as
promised in my half of the show is about
to crack open a heady topper the heady
topper not the heady an topper I've
learned today on stream but just the
heady topper this is the alchemists
Vermont and I like how just on the top
here it says drink from the can drink
from the can drink from the can they
really just want you to drink from the
can they were saying don't pour this
into a nice fancy glass just drink it
the way it's intended can that's what
it's driven again that's built and I
like what they say on the back and their
little description here as well it's not
it's not intended to be the biggest or
most bitter it's meant to give you wave
after wave of hoppy goodness on your
palate tremendous amounts of American
hops will creep up on you and leave you
with a dense hoppy finish in your mouth
so drinkable it's scary all right I like
I like that mental image of a bunch of
American hops creeping up on me it's
kind of kind of kind of terrifying
actually
but Cheers cheers to you Paul and all of
you at home watching thank you very much
or at work wherever that's a good this
chat still enjoying that cider
oh that's good
believe ycy few sauces of course of
course you have to you just had to try
then good example mmm hey no no no come
back come on seriously
really Wow come on wow you're fired you
walked into my fist this is how spouse
abuse happens it's not your fault Paul
it's not your fault mommy and daddy
would never blame it on you salsa meme
the other day is like you know when
you're at your friend's house and their
parents are yelling at them
oh it's too real in a while it's too
real yesterday well then let's move on
to our next star a which is regarding
the worst piece each case trends of 2017
this is actually on a YouTube video via
Dimitri at hardware connects our good
friend and pal and fellow youtuber he
put together a this fancy intro he's
good this is you know just something he
does in random videos it's not even
something like an intro that he does for
all videos it's just like hey I just
decided to spend five hours on this one
5 second clip in my videos because I'm
better than you it's crazy
yep yep I hate you I hate you Dimitri so
I'm making us look bad well your fancy
 be what be rolling no I
love you I love you so much I love marry
me
so he put together this worst PC case
trends video of 2017 and who better to
really comment on computer cases than
Dimitri I mean he's been reviewing these
things extensively for so long
I would regard him as one of the best PC
case reviewers of all time in current
existence so I really took this video to
heart didn't look out everything he said
what Dimitri's goat
he's a goat was goat greatest of all
time great symbols oh yeah this is nice
a nice fun accurate acronym I'll start
using now um so this is uh this is just
a brief rundown list
I suggest you still give him the view go
ahead and check out the video you can
hear a sexy Russian accent but we're
gonna go down just a brief list of the
things that he pointed out as being sort
of not the greatest
and that we've seen with peace each a
cease this year the first of which was a
lack of USB type-c integration and I
feel like this is a polarizing one
because type C is awesome
it's reversible it has a lot of
functionality and it's it's just a nice
it's a nice connection especially when
you open it up to like USB 3.1 gen2 you
get some really nice speeds 10 gigabits
per second and all that jazz it's nice
to have that on the front panel at the
same time there are not many devices
that use USB type-c currently let alone
you know USB 2 gen 2 3.1 gen2 so I feel
like I'm sure there are but in the grand
scheme of things it seems like let me
just pick up your phone okay okay one
one is your phone single example does
not make your argument of an
overwhelming which is already oh no
mine's a pix like cell uses facial -
it's the same family more or less it's
the same ok I am NOT one to knock USB
type-c ok I have a video that's already
up on floatplane about a slew an
onslaught of USB type-c devices there's
like 8 different products that I took a
look at and actually sort of did many
reviews on and that's coming to the
YouTube channel probably later this week
just lied to everyone no I didn't lie
everyone I'm just saying I'm just saying
it's like the knowledge the information
is still not out there as to how you
know how prevalence USB type-c is it's
still a long ways off to be honest okay
to be fair it's still a long ways off
from replacing micro USB as the as the
number one USB interface like my mom my
parents anyone in my family all my
friends if I showed up to their house
and said hey can you charge my phone I
guarantee you zero of them would be able
to help me so a little adapter that's
why I have an adept that's why I have a
micro USB to type C adapter keychain on
my keys because stuff where you're
peeking
I mean oh yeah I get super I'm peaking
on drugs um no yeah sorry so sorry I had
fun users but I'm just saying
lack of types the integration on cases
is a polarizing matter but I feel like
it's a pretty loud minority that should
still be heard and listened to I would
like to see more types II on on faces I
think especially the ones that are being
sold for over 120 130 hundred fifty
bucks should definitely have type C just
even if even if type C's not quite where
microUSB is right now it's still the
future and you're gonna have a computer
case ideally for more than a year or two
so you're gonna want to have that
built-in functionality ready to go
additionally he brought up that a lot of
cases this year were including cheap
generic black fans but he's not been a
fan of black men even some having molex
connections you know or or cheap LEDs
that's just like right there that just
don't look all that great I would agree
with that
what what he said that really stuck with
me is that he would like to see an oaf
an option for certain cases yeah I like
that and I really like that idea
I think case manufacturers should take
that comment to heart especially with
the super inexpensive cases the fans are
often a pretty significant part of the
cost if you're if you talk about a 40
$50 case that actually comes with two or
three fans in it yeah that's a pretty
decent chunk of the cost but beyond that
the higher-end cases like if you could
shave 15 or 20 bucks off of the cost and
give me it with no fans because I know I
know I'm gonna swap it out with the fans
that I want to buy their 15 or 20 bucks
each anyway then that would make a lot
of sense and I wouldn't end up with just
a bunch of crappy but but the thing is
like they they wouldn't be able to shave
that much off like with the fans that
they're using they'd probably shave like
five bucks off five or ten I would say I
would say like five bucks um but still I
mean it's still five bucks like for fans
that you're never gonna use that you're
just like like Paul said you're gonna
replace anyway I would still like to see
the no fan option just and also just
based on the principle that it's not
wasteful like I have so many case fans
that I just uninstalled immediately off
of my cases because I obviously replaced
them with other
better fans that are just kind of
sitting there collecting dust it's just
a wasteful it's just a wasteful practice
it's just a you know bunch of cheap
plastic just sitting there collecting
dust that will never be used for their
intended purpose but moving on here a
lack of interior variety basically
Demetri was saying that there's sort of
this one formula that every case
manufacturer uses for their interior you
got your motherboard tray right there
you know you've got maybe some cable
management with the power supply shroud
and you know your your rubber grommets
on the right and the top etc you maybe
you got a drive bay on the right side
towards the front of the case you're
mounting a i/o mounts on the top and so
forth and I kind of get that it's it's
also one of those things where I'm like
well it doesn't really it's not like
it's not working out it's not like I
feel like anything's lacking in the
interior department so much rather than
I would like to see more innovation
right it's not like that it's bad it's
just that it's not innovative so I think
I I think that a lot of case
manufacturers this year played it safe
they weren't really trying bold new
risky types of interior layouts because
they were just sticking to what worked
and I'm sort of that mentality of like
well if it's not broken don't fix it
type of thing so I kind of get both
sides of the argument but as a consumer
more than a more than a you know I'm not
a manufacturer at all but more as a from
a consumer standpoint I would love to
see more innovation in the interior
layouts for a lot of these popular cases
I think that's just moving and driving
the the whole industry forward market
forward really and additionally he
brought up the issue sort of the same
thing with power supply shrouds while
it's really nice that we have power ship
power supply shrouds now on a variety of
wide variety of cases where we really
didn't a year or two ago he's saying
that it's sort of the same thing all the
features were seemingly copy pasted from
one case to the next you've got this
lower third shell that has maybe some
SSD mounts on the top you've got you
know a place to hide your cables maybe
you can remove
some of the the top panels like the dark
bass 700 in order to you know like there
you go perfect timing to stash more
cables through or to have maybe like a
reservoir or pump shine through and
things like that open up some radiator
support but you know I feel like there
might be I'm kind of with the mitri on
this one there could be more innovative
things that could be being done with
power supply shrouds he also mentioned
that cases are getting bigger have you
noticed that
have you noticed cases getting bigger
I've seen lots of new massive cases and
I keep turning them away like the cosmos
700 yeah I turned that one away to I
think part of it was because it's just
too big and I don't want it taking up
space but the other thing is that I only
see the value in really huge cases if
you're gonna be doing some custom water
cooling know that sounds sounds
unpleasant though no that's good okay
don't worry all right
well circle back to that I'm sure um but
you know I think I think cases are
getting bigger because manufacturers are
pitching that pitching the size as
having more airflow where that's not
necessarily the case 100% of the time
just because you have a bigger case
doesn't mean you have more air flowing
through it you could have a conversely
you could have a smaller case like a
mini ITX even if it's a larger mini ITX
case having tons of airflow going
through it size doesn't necessarily
indicate air flow abundance or
deficiency in my opinion and I think
that's how a lot of these larger cases
this year were being marketed as having
tons of airflow and we saw that as not
being necessarily true especially with
you know one of his next points being
that the airflow on a lot of these cases
I'm sure gamers Nexus would agree is
just especially for coming from the
front of the case where most of the
intake is coming from he Dmitri
mentioned the the H 500 P
and how that wasn't exactly everything
we hoped it would be cracked up to be
and and having just sort of a cutoff
system at the front panel where your
fans weren't able to breathe necessarily
even cases that seemingly had lots of
ventilation and mesh were not delivering
the amount of airflow that people were
anticipating simply because of the
positioning of the fans perhaps the the
front panel was just encroaching on them
too much even though they had tons of
mesh if the front panel is just a couple
like a millimeter or two away from your
from your fans you're not getting much
air through that mesh anyway any any
useful air anyway and yeah so I
definitely agree with that
and I feel like there was a huge
emphasis sort of an obsession with like
silent cases and having like the best
acoustics ever and so you'd have this
really closed off front panel for a lot
of chassé ease that just did not deliver
the airflow
I think the mesh if I see right there is
is a great is a great case that sort of
stays true to the older type cases where
it's just straight-up mesh straight-up
mesh on the front there's really nothing
impeding any sort of airflow from those
front intake fans which is sort of your
your first defense against overheating
I'm just getting pumping lots of airflow
through that front panel given the given
the reception of the H 500 P especially
with the air flow issues that it had it
definitely made it seem like very kind
of forward looking for fractal to come
out with the mesh if I when they did oh
yeah just being straight solid modern
case with the tempered glass side panel
a lot of the modern features and been
just there like we're not blocking the
front at all she's got air flow there so
right and and you know I think it's a
lot of it has to do with like honestly
it's sad but true but like people buy
things based on the way they look you
know I used to think I used to think
that only Apple fans bought hardware
because it looked good but then like a
while ago I realize like no like PC
enthusiasts buy because it looks
good too I mean why do you think RGB has
taken off and
you know it's kind of like its own beast
now and the same thing goes for cases
like the H 500 P kind of with the
mentality that it looks really nice I
mean it's one of the like arguably one
of the nicest looking cases of 2017 but
as gamers Nexus demonstrated has
terrible air flow and a lot of people
were super hyped about this case because
haribol
okay I know what you would expect given
that it was a case that came from a
series that was previously known for
high airflow okay then yeah I guess
terrible relatively speaking based on
how there was some what you would expect
from a series that was previously known
as AI air blow well and its current
series but because I mean know
everything it's everything that they all
right if you go back to the way cooler
master was pitching it like leading up
to CES and everything like that half
higher flow yes it was a continuation of
that series everything they said
afterwards because they realized like
they test these things themselves right
know to some degree right what the
shortcomings are yeah they're like it's
not actually a high airflow case it's
the H 500 P right and and so on so they
they step back from that like branding
it as a high airflow case yeah and you
know people's response was was what it
was which is you know not the best right
but and I guess you if you're not
expecting it to be high airflow then
what not a terrible case what else would
you expect from the only case in 2000
you're at a new 200 millimeter and run
integrands you're right and playing
devil's advocate everything always been
known to pump out more airflow and
higher CFM CFC yeah CFM then there's
like like smaller fan I mean okay yeah I
get it and there was some sort of
beating around the bush as how that was
marketed but I understand I understand
both sides really I do I'm cracking open
a
nation brewing mosaic IPA an IPA yes
which is not a beer that you hate yeah
might not be yours IPA
this is Vermont brew brewed and it says
we who wonder are not lost which is a
paraphrasing of course of the verses
that go with Mithrandir and end here yes
I love it I love it um okay so moving on
sorry no that was completely incorrect
Aragorn
I was I was gonna say I don't know
enough lore in that fandom my god to
correct you properly yes the blade that
was broken the cider the cider is strong
with this one
and then finally choked oh wait no I
already said that
so I mean honestly it'sit's a pretty
good video it's a really good video you
guys should check it out on hardware
connects thank you to meet you for
continuing to pump out really good
content Sal looks like he's fiddling
with our next link but that's okay
because we're gonna be talking about
some rising to details that were
recently had some light shed on them
this is an article from WCC F Tech this
is about AMD's new lineup of 2000 series
CPUs codenamed Pinnacle Ridge risin 7 5
and 3 CPUs will debut on the 12
nanometer process and it's gonna be in
q1 2018 we're gonna be seeing risin 7
rising to 7 in February risin 5 and 3 in
March and they will be sporting the news
and + architecture microarchitecture
which is fantastic the new family is
said to bring in a nice batch of higher
clock speeds and better overclock
ability to the table in addition to
support faster ddr4 that's gonna be
exciting hopefully ddr4 pricing will
drop because if they're stickin with the
same sort of you know infinity fabric
which I'm sure they are high speed
memory is going to be in high demand and
right now even low speed memory is super
outrageously overpriced or just really
expensive right now
it's gonna be crazy if they're like you
know what Rison to performs best with
4000 megahertz ram people are gonna be
spending an arm and a leg on memory
unless the prices drop soon so hopefully
that also happens by you know hopefully
q1 q2 of next year we've also got you
know this is gonna be a huge rival
there's gonna be a direct rival with
Intel's 900 series the follow-up to
coffee Lake which is gonna be expected
around June 2018 of next year and this
is gonna bring 8 cores to Team Blues
main stream platform for the first time
ever with I mean coffee like just
bringing the six core thing to the page
stream platform for the first time ever
and now we've got eight cores it's gonna
be a huge competitor hopefully it'll be
hopefully it'll bring more competition
to rise in then coffee liked it I feel
like it would especially because we
hardly even have a stable inventory we
can hardly get supply of coffee like
right now I'm hoping that Intel doesn't
jump the gun for the 900 series and they
don't launch it super early and it ends
up being a complete deficit of supply
where anywhere you can find a 900 series
CPU is 20 30 40 percent over MSRP very
similar to how coffee lake is right now
so competition is good even with sort of
risin or I'm sorry AMD being the
underdog I'd still like to see Intel
step up to the plate and finally give
AMD a run for their money in the
mainstream market so assuming the WCF
tech article we're looking at is is
accurate which is a bold allegation fall
you know this this one doesn't seem too
far out there it seems pretty
straightforward but it is worth pointing
out the difference here between the
upcoming series's of processors that are
based on Zen architecture from AMD so
what we have right now summit ridge
based on the Zen the og Zen cpu
architecture what Kyle's talking about
which is coming up codenamed Pinnacle
Ridge is based on Zen Plus which is a
refinement but also appears to
potentially be a die shrink and I don't
believe this is confirmed but seems
pretty likely that they're moving from
to nanometers 212 nanometer mm-hmm and
then again like yeah I already said
maybe maybe hardcore counts we're not
really sure but should still be the aim
for socket and that that's what we're
looking at the beginning of 2018 Xen 2
is the actual second generations and
architecture so that's like if you're
looking at this kind of like the
tick-tock thing like with Intel it'd be
a tickin than a talk I guess comes and
does n+ is into right then to
potentially down to seven nanometer
which would be pretty huge and obviously
this is further out so more speculative
but also 2019 so yeah but but just just
to keep it in your head
Zen Zen plus Zen to like all different
things but Zen plus 28 teens into
probably 2019 yeah it's a little bit
confusing
I get tripped up myself sometimes but
thank you for the clarification Paul the
other thing to note is that there's
still very little known about the Zen
plus microarchitecture though the 12
nanometer should mean higher clock
speeds and better power efficiency with
those transistors being closer together
we've got board makers releasing the X
470 and X 450 models I just lowered my
chair just like shrunk a small mushroom
and X 450 models based on new 400 series
chipset designs so it's gonna be the 400
series chipset that's very exciting I
think the most exciting part about all
of this though or one of the most
exciting things is that we're still
using the same am for socket that we've
seen on X 370 and B 350 I think that's
great
so up grandma so if AMD wants to
maintain goodwill from people who
invested in a.m. Ford when it comes to
these new series chipsets they need to
not feel like you like you need to get
the new chipset motherboard in order to
get the most out of these new processors
right and how would they do that
honestly like maybe disable overclocking
or something like that door or if they
had some ridiculously awesome feature
that was only on 400 series chipsets
it's there's different there's different
different ways they could do things that
they could do but like probably the the
most fundamental change would be access
to PCI Express Lanes and those are laid
out yeah and if if then Plus does have
more PCIe lanes somehow like if you
would need the new chipset in order to
access those or something like that
right which could be a make or break
thing depending on how you're looking at
that potential upgrade path but yeah for
anyone who you know was thinking AMD's
gonna let me take my am for you know X
370 motherboard that I bought at the
beginning of 2017 and still being using
it in 2019 for Xen 2 CPUs with no
noticeable drawback in you know feature
support or or speed or something like
that like I don't know I don't I don't
know how that I don't know how it's
gonna I'm comfortable I'm cool with them
like having additional features with the
400 series chipset that you can't get in
the 300 series chipset as long as it's
not Jamie because you're a extra extra
yeah if you're a power user if you're
like a hardcore workstation freak and
you're doing tons of rendering or you
need those nvme drives in there with
additional PCIe lanes then okay then
yeah like throw that into the 400 series
chipset but if you make it to the point
where it's not even practical or we're
feasible to to drop you know a 2000
series CPU into your X to be 70
motherboard then it's kind of like
you're you're trying to milk you're
trying to milk the truth really it's
like yeah we made it supported yeah you
can it's technically backwards
compatible or forwards compatible but
you're it's sideways sideways what I
don't yeah sideways sideways compatible
but but you're not gonna want to do it
because we're offering so much other
good stuff on the new platform that
you're gonna want to switch anyway so
it's got to be fair it's got to be fair
to consumers and where you draw the line
is kind of
blurry nvme connectivity as far as
number of devices the number of lanes
have to be something that they could
segment out but yeah it just depends on
how they want to do it and what they
want to keep for the next gen versus the
current gen yeah we'll see what they
decide moving on though but yeah fun
stuff with Rison - let's move on to pit
my pc let me take a look at some of you
guys the systems that you guys submitted
on Twitter's and tell you how to maybe
improve the look or overall quality of
your build first up we've got one from
Dylan and doesn't look like he's got any
specs provided so we're just gonna have
to sort of guess here does look like
he's got in asrock rise and Taichi
motherboards so it's probably the next
370 board with perhaps the rise in seven
CPU it's pretty nice board so I'd
imagine with an NZXT crack and cooler on
there looks very nice and then s340
perhaps an elite with the GTX founders
Edition card of some sort I would
imagine it's either a gtx 1070 1080 1080
i does have sli fingers on it so it's
not a ten six feet and yeah looks like
you've got some trident z RGB in there
fantastic components here all around but
let's see what can we do to help you out
here doing I would say the first order
is getting some sleeved extensions
perhaps those can go a long way in
making your system look a little bit
more showy and a bit more presentable
the fans also is a huge thing that it's
a huge factor that can sort of add to
the personality or characteristic of
your overall system so you've got the
pretty much you know the sort of stock
stock fans from NZ Eckstein here the
ones quite frankly the ones that Dmitri
was complaining about in his top worst
trends of PC cases in 2017 s-video so
they're just cheap black fans and not
saying that there's anything wrong with
them but if you really want to sort of
make it your own and you've already got
the beefy main components in hand then
you know it's time to start looking at
aesthetics sure maybe swapping those out
it's also kind of interesting
you've made that top fan and intake
don't really see that too often looks
like it's an intake fan at the top so
you want to bring in some air from the
top inside of your case most people have
that as an exhaust cologne as VR ends
cool and cool of the arms perhaps I mean
or you could be exhausting hot air
coming off of your vrm is either way but
you know sure sure why not I'm not
asking for it because I'm sure that
doesn't make a huge huge difference it
might not be the best if you don't have
a dust filter out there that's what I
was gonna say is dust buildup might be
an issue I was gonna say the the stockin
or the Nvidia reference design a cooler
here is what stands out to me as far as
just clashing a bit with the green
because it's got green oh yeah
other than that we got mostly black
white and it looks like you got some
purple going on with the LEDs although
granted you can change the colors of
those of course yeah yeah that's that's
what clashes most of me other than that
everything I mean things are pretty well
coordinated and stuff and the cable
management I feel like you've done the
best you can with um you know barring
the use of extensions or something like
that right to make just things look a
little little prettier all around so
very nice very nice clean build though
yeah okay thanks Dylan Thank You Dylan
next up we've got one from Takeshi
Takeshi 7um Takeshi thank you very much
for submitting your system the sooner
you feature this one the sooner I can
stop posting it all right great
again no real specs here we just kind of
have a couple pictures oh wait I'm sorry
yes you did include it we've got a
Pentium II or 90 but 965 overclocked for
threads at 4.2 6 gigahertz a GTX 480
from Nvidia and Asus p5q which is on the
p45 chipset from Intel we have 8 gigs of
hynix ddr2 800 speed and it's the cooler
cooler master master liquid 240 Corsair
obsidian 450d nice little case there
raid max Thunder beat to power supply
and it says here that your CPU is
getting attempts over 90 degrees Celsius
I can lower it to 4 gigahertz to drop it
275 see
I think 90 sees a little bit to warm
breath I would I would drop it somewhere
between 4 gigahertz and 4.2 6 you know
if you can get if you can stay under 80
if you can stay under 80 that's
generally what I recommend but apart
from that it looks like you've got
interesting motherboard because we have
a 24-pin connector on the very left of
the motherboard whereas we usually see
it on the right that kind of forced you
to to wire the cable and it's sort of
weird and maybe not so ideal path over
your graphics card and it sort of looks
a little messy also the blue fan isn't
really doing it for me on the power
supply if you want to flip that I know
the 450d does have a power supply dust
filter on the bottom so you could look
into that
obviously the ketchup and mustard on
your PCIe cables and 24-pin are not
doing you any favors so perhaps look
into getting some black slate extensions
if you are if you feel like if you plan
on sticking with your current hardware
like the main platform of your system
for a while you're not planning to
upgrade anytime soon then you know you
can have some spare money to invest into
aesthetic aesthetics
let's see there's a nasty label black
with a sticker on your on your fan on
the rear rear exhaust fan which you
could remove this one it's a barcode
barcode ok barcode and get rid of that
yeah why get rid of that and you know I
think than that I mean you've got sort
of gold color scheme here because your
your motherboard obviously it doesn't
really have much to match up with so I
don't know if you want to go all-out you
could get some like nice fancy cables
that are black and gold sleeved that's
something that you could look into
obviously you could maybe get some new
RAM that has actual heat spreaders
instead of just the bare PCBs that you
know maybe you could spray paint gold or
something like that try to color match
the heatsinks on your motherboard I
think that would look really nice it
would be fairly affordable too you know
apart from having to buy a new Ram kit
that would be expense
actually but yeah that's all I got
anything you want to add Paul get rid of
that red Santa cable yeah not really I
mean it's just it's it's a it's a it's a
much older system when it comes to the
core components in there so you're not
dealing with parts that were designed
with as much of an aesthetic
consideration of mine so yeah it's
harder to it's harder to color
coordinate and it's also harder to say
here's the money you should invest in
this when you know one dimensional
system with ddr2 memory yeah
it's nearing the end of its useful life
right that's weird to ddr's in front of
it ahead of it so yeah I agree with Paul
but thank you for sending him next up
we've got one from Rolando with his
4770k z97 gaming 5 motherboard from MSI
excuse me ROG Strix gaming GTX 1080i and
NP pro M love that case and some
Ballistix sport 16 gig ddr3 kit from
crucial um you know the first thing that
stands out to me here is is that your
top two fans are different top two fans
are different it looks like they have
different blade patterns one two three
four five six seven one two three four
five six seven eight nine you're right I
don't know why that stood out to me one
has nine blades and one has seven blades
and what I would say is just use the
same fans throughout your entire system
so if you have three it looks like you
might have two or three of the same fans
in here I would just say buy more of
those same fans and replace all the
other ones in your case that are not
alike flagging flag and dry and Chet
says it looks like maybe a 140 you know
and a 120 which is possible it doesn't
you have the one on the left is wider
yep than the one on the right yep I
couldn't be unless it's true might be a
wide-angle thing or something probably
not but no I think I think he's right
that's actually true the one on the Left
does look a bit bigger
yeah so that's something to also
consider I mean just for a uniform look
I mean again if we're talking aesthetics
here functionally it looks like you're
pretty good to go man
1080i and a 4770k you're flying you're
good no need to upgrade core components
anytime soon but so at this point you
can spend the extra money or any money
you have on on looks and appearance so I
would say get some new fans in there
extensions extensions are always going
to be something that adds to the overall
look of your system at least for the 24
pin and your PCIe MSI z97 gaming 5
motherboard apparently has a green
debugging debug LED was that thing
really know why I did not know that that
was a thing that why would it be green
that's very strange I've never noticed
that I've seen that before
um disabled yeah disabling you can if
you can because it's definitely clashes
yeah more keep it up beyond that there's
a blue light here I'm not sure if that's
a reflection of something or if that's I
know it's gonna be on the cooler part of
the cooler
I feel like this part of its also
classroom just a little bit it looks
like you have a brace on here to prevent
GPU sag which is mostly it looks like I
still load up here a little bit of sag
going on there
it's hard to say for sure but I don't
know I mean okay the cable management
super-clean yeah good so you know that
looks pretty good there I like the
included a shot of the back kill
management as well nice kill manager in
the bash I think you've done a pretty
good job with yeah so you know I mean
it's good it's not a whole lot to be
done as far as you know other than you
know getting some worse the investing is
a little bit more an aesthetic stuff
like you cable extension is that kind of
thing yeah a very nice building
thanks for Wanda next up we've got
Michael he's the person who donated on
YouTube to get featured oh hey okay
8700 K 5 gigahertz gigabyte Z 370 gaming
7 motherboard 16 gigs of Vengeance ddr4
EVGA CLC 280 1080 GT X 1080 for the win
- and a super nova g3 750 watt with an H
500 P with front panel mesh mod and X 3
R 3 cable mod addressable RGB strips no
all right so you're pretty much decked
out in the aesthetic Department it looks
like and it looks like you have a pretty
nice setup of hardware here something
that most people would kill for let's
see what what could we add we add here
the mesh mod on the H 500 P I wasn't
sure when I saw gamers Nexus do that if
that was something that gamers Nexus was
just gonna make ever if anyone is
actually gonna do it looks like yeah
people follow the suit that's awesome
though that's gonna drop your degrees
according to gamers Nexus is testing up
to 10 degrees Celsius which is huge
so that's great I would say honestly you
have really clean cable management here
the the cabin looks pretty sweet there
are a few little loopy cables up here
that be tightened up below maybe could
be tightened up a little bit also you
got the EVGA close look cooler that has
the unfortunate kind of USB plug on the
bottom of it that this really not a
whole lot you can do with yeah
unfortunate position but yeah I don't
know if you could tuck that down a
little bit maybe but find it a whole lot
I see that there is an additional what
looks like maybe an 80 or 90 millimeter
fan down here at the top for example
it's an interesting addition and I
wonder if time does anything I'm not
sure how much benefit that would provide
but okay sure
also it just seems to be right up
against the expansion brackets or the
the PCIe looks like he's got some red
zip ties yeah
holding it down to the case I like I
like that you've got a little mascot in
here the little skeleton dude ahmud
that's cool
that's Ahmed Ahmed from I think that's
the Jeff Dunham I've been true of quests
that's one of his characters oh yeah
sweet um nice nice I can build overall I
like the kind of black black and white
and silver thing you got going on
I've also the mesh mod just looking at
some of the pictures on the front it
doesn't look as clean as well the
plastics on there but of course of
course you got to take the performance
benefits over the aesthetics I think in
that situation right
so very nice build there Michael well
done done sir
kind of like similar to the last build I
feel like the cable extensions would be
kind of the next step for you right but
not necessarily by any stretch yeah just
to top it off I'd say some some nice
black sleeves extensions would go nicely
but thank you very much Michael next
cryptic ninja with horizon 5 1600 CPU
stock cooler Asus crosshair 6 hero 8
gigs of crucial memory msi gtx 960 2 gig
EVGA a 50 BQ and body blah blah and a
$40 cooler case alright well there's
your problem
yeah the case which I mean $40 it's a
functional case I have built in this I
think I'm not sure if it's exist this
exact case but I've built in a $40
cougar case and it's definitely
immediately the weak points in the
builds yeah but lets you get everything
put together and functional but doesn't
let you position stuff this curler like
$1,000 bill yeah but instead it looks
like a $400 build because of the case
but that said before you upgrade your
case I would add another 8 gig memory
stick just just to give yourself to by 8
I don't know maybe it's miserable if
you're multitasking yeah if you're
gaming
while streaming or if you're gaming
while wiping and browsing the web then
definitely and check here check your
system usage check your resources
see and my maxing out my eight gigs or
my like I'm like Dom only at 50% brah I
also want to say that a 320 gig
mechanical hard drive is is more of a
liability than a benefit at this point
who knows I mean I mean it seems like
probably a drive that was carried over
from an old system or something like
that which I can understand but I would
I would clear that out at some point
just cuz 320 gigs for a 3.5 inch drive
just that the amount of size and power
that that's taking compared to amount of
storage you're getting it's not that
good of a trade-off I think you should
upgrade his GPU first GPU first I think
so I mean cousin say alright 62 just cuz
the risin 5 1600 can definitely handle
more than that you're right and I feel
like if you are if you are gaming with
this system then you could afford to
upgrade the GPU I mean the gtx 960 is
already not super fast as it is but the
fact that you're also dealing with a
2gig frame buffer especially with modern
games i feel like even lower end games
are starting to push the bandwidth of
two gigs so it might be time to upgrade
your GPU before anything else and then
have those things follow suit I don't
know a gtx 1066 cube i it would be a
nice upgrade i think yeah that's not
gonna set you back too much especially
if you can you know sell some parts
maybe the gtx 960 might be slightly more
practical given the memory prices right
now - so yeah true that yeah new case
new graphics card add a little bit more
memory all those things and then
resubmit resubmit - yeah a pc yeah cuz
your cable management already looks like
it's in the right direction so i think
with a better case you'd be even cleaner
yeah very much more to work with day
thanks everyone who submitted for pin my
pc we will be doing this again either
next episode or the one after that so
don't get discouraged if we didn't pick
you this time around but thank you
everyone who did submit next up we've
got the gamers report leave over some of
these really quickly because I didn't
honestly have too much time to take
super notes
each of these articles so we'll just
kind of run through them quickly the
first ones from PC Gamer it's basically
highlighting warhammer two's laboratory
which is a new sort of free Skaven
laboratory update it's the free scab and
laboratory update it's got a bunch of
sliders that you can tweak and this is
to change things like the level of
gravity in the game monster size and
there's a unit slider which will
probably crash your system when max down
so the reason why this this article
caught my attention is because it seems
like a fun tool or a fun toy to mess
with to test your CPU strength because
if you look at that I mean those are
each individually rendered warriors and
you can increase the unit size so that
you have literally thousands of these
tiny warriors on screen it's kind of
like remember like the Total War Shogun
member how that was like huge in terms
of like texting your CPU and seeing how
much you can handle this is sort of the
modern version of that where you can
adjust all these different parameters to
really put your CPU through its paces
and obviously that's not the initial
intent the original intent of the
developer it's more so just for
entertainment because it's a game but
for all of us enthusiasts who are
benchmarking constantly and who care
about CPU performance this could be a
fun toy to mess around with I mean you
could literally mess around I could mess
about with this for hours changing the
different sliders changing the gravity
settings if you change the gravity
settings as soon as like one warrior
bashes into like an army of rats the
rats all go flying and it's just like a
almost like a particle effect of rats
just flying through the air that could
you know affect your frame rate one way
or another that's some super exciting I
would just like to see this many
textures being rendered at once on
screen and seeing how different CPUs are
handling it because often times games
are primarily GPU bound and there are
there are very few games these days that
are primarily CPU bound and I feel like
this is perhaps an interesting tool
that could appeal to a lot of benchmark
reviewers and things like that just
because it is so CPU demanding so I
would like to check this out it's free
I have Warhammer - if you have Warhammer
- Paul already has it he's one step
ahead of the crew and I would highly
suggest that you maybe do a video on it
for something Paul because I think
that'd be something interesting that a
lot of us would like to see if you
tested this sort of download this this
game with its different views sorry are
you know watching porn while I do my
half of the show and porn at all what
are you talking about yes I have my
doubts just just just okay
um moving on though just a quick little
tidbit on Warhammer - let's move on to
our next article which is about
overwatch folks at Blizzard this is from
PC games and comm overwatch is is now re
reforming reformatting it's a reporting
tool one of the most requested tools for
mitigating the toxicity in game has
finally landed as part of the winter
wonderland event event patch apparently
there's like lots of issues with
overwatch players being just dicks being
royal dicks either in the game chat or
from hacking or cheating or whatever
there's a lot of toxicity and finally
Blizzard has taken some steps against
these toxic people because with the
winter wonderland event patch if you now
report a player and Blizzard takes
action against said player and they're
the count
look at these two dudes just sitting
there talking about video games like
people want to hear with that I love
video games I love it I play them all
the time yeah yeah you know we just look
at the posters behind us bro blew the
posters clearly anyway that's what we're
talking about now now if you report a
player and Blizzard takes action against
their account you will be notified that
your report was heard and you'll be
notified in game you've not an email
not some kind of text message but you'll
actually be notified in-game hey that
person you reported for being a dick is
now banned so there you go the show this
kind of shows gamers that they're being
heard and the developers are on their
side it encourages gameplay across
across all of their uh the demographic
dicks will get warnings mm-hmm dick
holes will get warnings if they're being
assholes like the assholes they are if
they're being close to if they're
getting close to being suspended or
banned they will get warnings now saying
hey your behavior has been kind of
shitty because you've been a dick knock
it off or you'll get banned or suspended
or what have you so that's it it's just
that it just it seems like the level of
communication between the developers and
the toxic people and the regular gamers
is just sort of strengthening with this
latest patch update that's good see but
you you report someone yeah you get the
feedback they've been man yeah exactly
then you get a century then you get a
sense of pride and accomplishment pride
and accomplishment and also the sense
that do you feel like your reporting is
actually doing something because I feel
like with me when I report something I
often feel like there's no resolve like
I feel like there's no like that's the
end that's the last thing I'll ever do
and that's the last thing we'll ever see
about this case that I have and that
I'll never know if my report was ever
read or sent or heard or ever acted upon
and this is this is good validation that
people's voices are being heard anytime
they're being they feel like they're
being wronged didn't you know while
playing this game I don't have a sense
of pride and accomplishment right now
you sure do and why should you not also
oh yeah I was getting carried away quite
literally probably slipping slowly let
me out of frame do you just wanna you
just want to scale this whole this whole
room right now and finally our last
story here is from PC gamer once again
about just a quick little review on
fallout 4
Villar this is one of the first triple-a
titles to ever get a VR treatment and it
really does seem according to PC gamer
like a full-fledged ball for yeah we'll
skip we'll skip the let's get the skin
betting cuz it's no one cares about this
baby it's a BBC article
no one cares no one cares maybe see
fallout 4 is getting it right
by including you're implementing VR it's
been a great VR implementation according
to the folks at PC Gamer the VATS system
is one of the best parts about the game
instead of allowing you to target a
specific area or areas on your enemy or
enemies and then watching your attacks
play out into a cinematic view the VATS
system in VR works more like a
traditional bullet time effects the time
slows down and you aim with the
controller you feel a lot more connected
to the action so instead of just having
like an automated like select your
targets and then press a button and then
just watch a cinematic like a cinematic
clip of all your enemies just getting
shot down you're actually doing the
shooting yourself and it feels a lot
more immersive but it's sort of in a
bullet time sort of sense so you feel
like you're just you have like a Deadeye
like a you look at you know like a Red
Dead Redemption type of effect or Max
Payne effect if you will which is pretty
cool it sounds super cool it sounds
super cool I really want to try fallout
4 in VR it sounds awesome the pip-boy
however doesn't translate this well the
pip-boy was like you're sort of like a
menu screen where you you know have it
on your wrist or whatever you actually
have to hold up your wrists in order to
use it and you have to use a d-pad on
one of the the vibe controllers to
actually navigate which I mean if you
would imagine a d-pad versus mouse and
keyboard it's not quite as efficient so
where the that system gets it right the
pip-boy kind of falls or kind of pales
in comparison at the end of the day
though the remarks were overwhelmingly
positive for for this particular title
for for fallout for VR and it's a good
sort of decorating is yeah it's it's
like the sims all-in-one wrapped up into
one so it's a good benchmark for
other triple-a title games to follow if
they're trying to implement they're
trying to make their game into VR trying
to make it be our friendly okay I'm this
is this is the model you should follow
if you're a triple-a game developer and
you're looking to make your get your
next game
vr friendly where as doom VFR or doom VR
has not been receiving the same sort of
positive marks as this particular title
no where as you know duke doom v vr
seems to be more of like a doom
simulator than an actual play gameplay
playthrough of do I haven't read it yet
I haven't tried to get either but I feel
like I've heard that the movement is
really bad like you have to like
teleport and when you're not teleporting
it just feels very you feel like you're
on Rails type of thing where it doesn't
feel like you're actually because
because there's a thing about doom is
that what makes the game is the pacing
you know what I mean you're constantly
jumping around the map you're moving if
you're idle at any point you're dead you
have to constantly move around and I
feel like that's a huge challenge of VR
because how do you make the user jump
around the map without teleporting and
not feel completely nauseous so I feel
like the their their solution to that
was just sort of either make you
teleport anyway or to have you kind of
casually move around the map and and not
really grasp the whole mechanism of a
fast-paced gaming Chetty was
traditionally chat said that doom VR is
poopy do do pretty much accurately
summed up by a lot of the critics that
I've read on online so far so that's an
object yeah it is it is unfortunate and
let's see is it fall off or is the
Fallout series is what Bethesda I
believe so yeah they're both ESDA and
doom is it yeah right okay so two
different developers two different
approaches obviously the one for for the
festive worked out a little bit better
this time around so hopefully we see
more Triple A games implementing they
are in a positive way and and yeah I
mean I think things are gonna just look
upward from here just a
all that doom VR we want a
full-fledged triple-a game in VR we
don't want some sort of simulation of
that game that happens to play well with
VR so uh thank you very much
PC gamer for that article I think we can
go ahead boom is also also Bethesda
dooms also Bethesda so it's a chat says
which is really weird cuz I thought it
was a Bethesda but it just doesn't make
sense to me that the fallout 4 rendition
in VR would do so well and yet they
would flop so heavily on the doom
version of VR they might have ended
their production there might have been
different individual production that's
why I'm thinking maybe ed worked on the
VR version of doom and Bethesda took
control of their fallout 4 version I
don't know I'm not sure the Festivus it
games all this is coming straight from
from twitch chat and I trust I trust
twitch chat holy they are the masses
just the publisher I mean twitch it
might as well be both good luck bit but
this is why we should never do the games
report right so oh yeah yeah I mean come
on we mainly focus on tech tech news and
even that's a stretch so for us to be
report really accurately reporting on
games I mean I think we've been accurate
super accurate alright so let's go ahead
and why don't we do it you want to do

Budweiser faint like if I had to go the
domestic route America domestic is not
my favorite pick a letter but we we have
like what a couple couple options I
would say Budweiser it's the lesser of
all evils
I don't like Coors Light I mean I don't
like any of them but I would drink a
Budweiser before Coors Light or a Bud
Light unless it's the Bud Light Mitch

Spreadshirt bruised blackberry and I'm
not familiar with that lakefront
breweries click Oh click yeah please
please no rocky Brewing Company weekend
at Louie's thirdspace brewing happy
place always black husky brewing spruce
and good City Brewing reward I've only
heard of a two or three of those but I
would say gee I like happy place just
cause it's in west Pale Ale just cause
it's a passion fruit and berry flavors
which balance out the hopper aromas
making this a full body but very
drinkable thing I wouldn't say a happy
place all right that's time ago for you
have our votes now thank you very much
Joseph T for the donation for every
hundred dollars hundred holy crap Kyle
here is wyfy sauce and your $100 Merry
Christmas by the way someone said I was
your nemesis no idea why me there Fred
here's the deal if paul sets up the
straw poll i requested and you honor it
I will give Paul 100 and you 200 you
must honor for either payout I feel like
I'm on one of those sadistic like game
shows or like like Fred rants just a
super like rich billionaire and he's
just now looking for ways to entertain
his sick self by by playing off of the
common people forcing us to do
horrendous things is this for about
amusement is this drop hole the the
question he asked on my half yes one
through four I think it was the options
one through four of what I would carry
pie in the face I think number four was
you know why he sauces choice which but
okay we will keep that request to be
paying my next time in mind for Fred I'm
sure wifey sauce will be in contact so
we have the punishments lined up I am
thoroughly excited by your offer and as
I am terrified k3 7:07 $20 I have an rog
extreme ex 299 and a 79 20x I kept
getting random freezing took out all but
one dim and it works still need to
update BIOS but deep guys think it's the
BIOS or a bad mobo slash Ramji skill RJ
III 632 gigs you met have a bad abetik
didn't ya bad stick memory is often the
culprit for crashing and random freezing
like that you could do you could easily
do a Windows memory test Adam M tests
you can run them check them check that
could help you load it up on a USB Drive
and then load it up that would be a
possibility yeah do you do your BIOS
update though I mean check that see if
it changes anything yeah but look
chances are yeah a bad memory stick
isn't isn't that common also not the end
of the world should be replaceable
pretty easily yeah Rosario $50 you guys
are awesome for the weekend livestream
you hero nailed it now you guys should
switch hairstyles and facial hair in the
future for a screamer to possible okay
me me being Balder
somehow we keep circling back to me
being bald NOT bald but just very little
hair like Paul has I don't know why my
facial hair to be you kind of already
had my facial hair yeah for the stream
sorry I didn't know vem beard already
yeah he already here da da had succumbed
to to the beard member so I don't know I
don't think I would ever shave my head
fault
I just don't know how you sound like
swap for a day or something like that
doesn't seem physically yeah that seems
like it's a trap you're you it's a trick
it's a trick request just shave your
head for a day no it doesn't work that
way then put it back put it back just
just for a day no it's not but thank you
very much for the $50 donation
nonetheless where will we appreciate it
sir is easier hearty for the 10
Australian considering considered doing
a boy or Bo I'd NC grid computing build
I do not know much about that haven't
you haven't considered that myself
that's more reserved a specific
application very niche so yeah we know
to figure out how much interest there is
in that and that type of thing
yeah so not much I guess would be the
answer to grow back in Tosh before you
do one of those right Tom's brems myths
for the 100 Norwegian Cronus sadly watch
only two hours live rests 10 hours I
watched offline because time zones
I work at night so awesome hardware is
so much better than Spotify by the way
why did you why you didn't use to color
fluid in the elite belt the reason why I
didn't use two different colors in the
elite belt was because I didn't really
have another color that I felt would
match the silver there's separate loops
all that well two different loops one
for the CPU and one for the GPUs
interesting honestly I like the uniform
I like the uniform I don't think that
it's mandatory that just because you
have two loops you have to use two
different colors I think a lot of the
appeal for me comes from the fact that
you get two freakin reservoirs right
next to each other that look awesome and
the fact that you're cooling two
separate components main components of
your system independently of each other
which is great for the fact that if I
happen to be rendering or something
we're pretty much all the load is on the
CPU the CPU is unencumbered or the GPU
is unencumbered by one loop or the other
like the CPU gets all the attention from
that loop and the GPU doesn't get
sacrificed because of it I don't know I
guess I was just so happy with the Primo
chilled view and how it looked in one
loop that I was just like let's fill it
up with the other I did consider at a
certain point to fill the second loop up
with just distilled water to have sort
of a more clear look just have a more
crystal-clear look but I just I don't
know I'm very uniform in that sense I
just it was a personal choice it's a
personal choice there's no right or
wrong so but thank you very much hi
nation I need to answer the next two
questions I was about to go and take a
pee break but then I realized the next
two questions are both kind of directed
at me so ah moved for eleven ten dollar
donation said hey guys really enjoyed
playing overwatch with you guys during
the charity stream i moot we enjoy play
with you I remember moot my mood and
annoying Paul as tracer yes yes I he
killed me Congrats on surpassing your
donation goal goal also enjoy that hey
topper we're jealous
oh yeah I'm enjoying it enjoy certainly
am enjoy it well mmm Thank You mood
thanks for joining us and
during the stream and everything it was
really great to play games with all
y'all that was super fun asdf asdf $5
donation Paul from your store what size
shirt do you wear and what's your
experience with shrinking the site has
that info but I'd like your input cheers
I wear a large size large and it shrinks
ever so slightly but not extensively and
this is a large on me and that's just
fine nice this also is a shirt from the
same store by the way oh yeah by my
secret epic pants my secret is like I
actually hang dry I live with some
whyphy sauce I hang dry all my shirts
and my my actual like nice jeans
that's stupid f2p it's not stupid that's
- it's not stupid at all because your
shirt stays the same size as the day you
bought it which like when I'm trying
something on I want it to remain that
size putting anything in the dryer
especially on high heat will invariably
shrink it so all my shirts are the exact
same size of the day I bought them
that's all my graphic tees all the T's
from my own store ones that I've got
from tech syndicate or you know Paul's
hardware wherever I do not put any of my
good in the dryer I hang dry all
that and it was a huge learning
curve for me and sort of something that
I had trouble adopting at first because
it's more time and effort it's easy to
just throw something in your in the
dryer have the Machine do it but you
know it takes more time and effort to
actually hang up all that but the
end result is that I never run into like
a my favorite shirt that no longer fits
me you know especially as I increase in
my in my own personal size and
physicality getting fatter by the day I
need to make sure that the dryer isn't
putting me at any sort of physical
disadvantage on its own so those are my
two cents Jay don't sue me next up we've
got a donation from mV 67 with the
thirteen dollars and 37 cents elite as

Kyle speaking of your discussion of
cases and sizes I'm going to be doing a
couple of small form-factor builds to
challenge myself in 2018 the Dan case a
for SFX v2 excellent choice and
the log ghosts s1 allow now bloger oh
good the damn case a four that's gonna
be fun I wish I had a head one of those
on hand to actually build in I think
that's gonna be a really fun sort of
challenging build the load ghost s1 I'm
not super familiar with so let's see we
got see we got so you've got see we got
Luke Luke okay okay
this looks very similar to what's the
damn thing in the in case m1 it's kind
of similar looks like it still supports
a fully ATX power supply but perhaps
even smaller than the in case m1 not
sure if it has support for an AI Oh like
that case does but okay um honestly I'm
all for a mini ITX challenge I think
it's great
definitely forces you to sort of think
outside the box in how you're going to
you know which parts you're really gonna
use I think part choice is very
important in that sense but I wish you
the best of luck MB 67 be sure to tweet
me some pictures of the system systems
whenever you're done next I'm gonna
dingo my 40 for the 5 bucks thank you
very much no comment
appreciated dingo michael Percoco
happy holidays guys thank you for the
content also thank you to the community
and cell yes the community raised over
10 grand last weekend
holy community's awesome we have
the best fans on the internet
and cell processing is the best
moderator I've ever had the privilege of
knowing or working with so yeah like
cheers Cheers to those guys cheers to
all those all you guys all you guys
watching South you're all awesome we
love you truly you're the best rod 9265
$200 this is my father-in-law he has
been saying he related father-in-law
strikes again with the two hundred
dollar donation I didn't even catch it
in in chat does that does that have like
a whole new color that we've never even
seen before in super chat so I could
still read it's still red okay still red
but still just really just
it just feels even redder than the other
ones I'd be curious what a $500 donation
my would be particularly on pulse half
of the chance Heather and Kyle Merry
Christmas I love you you said no
Christmas presents this year but it
ain't Christmas yet and I'm dad so yeah
Thank You Rodney
I appreciate a man you're the best I
love you you're literally the most
awesome father-in-law son-in-law could
ask for although you're the only one
I've ever had so you know the sample
size is pretty small but no thank you
thank you I'm humbled by the donation

Fred Radley $5 actual question which
would you recommend one thick radiator
or two thin ones if room not an issue
I go to thin this room isn't an issue
yeah I would say you have more surface
area you would have more surface area in
general I guess every room and cost
because if you're talking about radiator
to talk about more fans so that's an
issue to consider as well but and if if
that's not concern then I would go more
radiators yeah I would agree with that
well dome is $5 the the final back here
thanks for all you guys do first tip and
it just feels right yeah hell yeah just
the tip baby please describe the please
describe the ideal awesome hardware
company Christmas party who do you hire
for Santa we hired J's two cents
he's Santa because he's like lovable but
also kind of grumpy yeah kind of grouchy
like Santa you would imagine would be in
a real-life scenario and then we'd have
like we post it either in your in your
place or my place here in the studio
maybe the ability of a bartender be it
build your own PC area build your own PC
area okay but like the host of the build
your own PC area would be dressed up
like elves because they're building like
building toys they're building pcs and

are for sure open bar tons of alcohol
like lots of alcohol and then more

this local deli and get this like tray
of it's like lunch meats that's not
likely it's like it's like nice deli
meats and
and rolls and stuff like that do and
then you just like MACUL sandwiches and
for some reason that always became
associated with Christmas Eve and I know
