show that Paul and I do every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right
here on twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
we also stream the show to our
respective YouTube channels we break it
the the entire episode into two halves
this week the first half was on Paul's
channel which has just happened so you
can go ahead and check that out in the
description below or you can go to the
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware if you
want to check that out side B is going
to be on my channel of course right here
on bit wit so thank you very much to all
of you who have just tuned in and those
of you who have stuck around since side
a we have a lovely half of the show
planned for you guys today and Paul is
gonna eat a bunch of popcorn while I
talk about tech news it's gonna be
exciting
you'll have never seen anything like it
your life will be forever changed it's
really good it's really good popcorn and
today's show is brought to you by
Vermont beer we have lots of beer from
Vermont and cider and cider and cider
it's not beer co cider has its own thing
so cheers to all of you who are drinking
at Holly's if you're of legal drinking
age we're happy to have you along
drinking with us this is a show where we
often swear or use adult language so if
you have little ones around
be sure to suffocate them with sand or
something um you know I mean circus and
sand isn't really a super precious
resource right now we have an abundance
as a cost effective very cost effective
way to suffocate the little ones um and
yeah that's pretty much it we sell
things on our stores which you can buy
objects off of in order to support us
like for example on my store bit Winx
slash store we have new things including
as you also hardware merch offer code
over 50 to save 10% on overs orders of
$50 or more yes or over 100 to save 20%
on orders of over 120 percent or more
guys so take advantage of these holiday
deals that we have going on the new Star
Wars awesome hardware Star Wars shirt is
beautiful this is a design by our very
own Brian maroc suit first shirt -
featuring Ari and hero on it I think
they did a great job it's still not a
pick I kind of want
one of with just just them here oh yeah
that'd be awesome if I might set that up
it's pretty adorable also we have new
mugs new mugs they're color mugs yes the
mugs are super nice quality we actually
have some in stock right here in the
studio the CPU cooler and the BIOS flash
sure the BIOS flash your mug looks to be
just one giant design that goes across
the whole thing whereas the CPU CPU
cooler is on both sides get one on
either side got a black handle white mug
Paul also has the zero insertion force
which looks awesome guys buy things buy
things from our stores it's a great way
for you to get awesome stuff while at
the same time supporting us so that we
have more money to pour back into the
channel buying bigger and better
products I don't know if this one is
even for sale anywhere do you guys want
to be ware of bottlenecks yeah I don't
think it is on sale I think that was
just a sample that we were sent by our
merch guy but I personally like it you
guys let us know what you think and Paul
store is Paul SmartNet I should I feel
so much and we're both selling mouse
pads yeah we're both selling mouse pads
this is the shorter smaller this is the
the short but like fatter one this is
the chod version there's also like a
long ding dong King Kong version that
spans the entire width of your desk or
you know so you can fit your keyboard on
top of it and stuff they actually look
really clean super clean high quality
stitched edging which does not seem very
friable
it's very nice rubber rubber backing and
the print job is fantastic
oh yeah you did you just railed that
mousepad you reeled it hard so guys by
stopping this is the this is how Paul
and I are able to afford crazy things
like the the pair of two terabyte 960
pros and PME assistants that I just put
in the elite build that we're what
thirteen hundred dollars a piece because
you guys have been buying lots of stuff
from our merch stores um I just got an
invitation to via twitch affiliate did
you really awesome hardware I just got
invited to be a twitch affiliate
it's just this is not the same as a
partner it's a it's an affiliate is it
okay is that the same as being a twitch
partner I think this is automated you
needed at least five hundred twelve
minutes broadcast in the last thirty
days at least seven unique broadcasts in
the last thirty days an average of three
concurrent viewers are more over the
last thirty days and at least 50
followers
that's hilarious any guys we're taking
the next step it's which affiliate
I don't know what that means is it the
same as partners or affiliates like it's
not like we're dating it's like we're
going out like it's complicated it's
like seeing each other from time to time
like if you were to hook up with someone
else it wouldn't be that big of a deal
that's kind of oh that's a weird
relationship term to use though for
people though like hey how are things
going with you and Amy we're affiliated
what does that mean when you're like
twitch we use don't language that many
people that you deal with you know in
that way you've got a you know you gotta
introduce the legalities to some I
suppose what this means potentially guys
is that if we if Paul and I get
everybody modes or affiliated soon then
who knows we might be able to actually
give you guys some like quality options
when you're watching our stream that
would be nice that would be nice for you
guys and for us because law oh yeah
again there's too much so there's other
benefits that come along with being a
twitch partner for sure and it's just
really because Paul and I are both lazy
and they're in julik
it's why we have at any points and
that's that coming in right after oh
we're streaming yeah but I mean damn
good on them for having an algorithm
that can automatically detect like these
people are streaming they get lots of
views and they're still not partnered or
affiliated we should send them an email
so good on you twitch you guys are right
on the money with that I love you twitch
but um thank you guys so much again for
watching and tuning in let's go ahead
and dive into some no wait no I have a
quick little announcement
to announcements so um there's still a
giveaway going on for a full-blown
gaming PC yes so we got we did a huge
charity livestream on last Saturday and
we raised over $10,000 through extra
light for the Children's Hospital of Los
Angeles you guys you guys helped raise
over 10 grand which is absolutely insane
last year we hit about three
thousand I think and we've nearly
tripled that yeah it's more than tripled
it's insane so Children's Hospital of
Los Angeles and because of beneficiary
yes and because of that we are doing an
epic giveaway we already gave away the
first system on stream that's already
done I'm gone with I've been in contact
with the winner for that but there's
still an entry level entry level in
quotes thread Ripper PC that's still
super high energy about eighteen hundred
and fifty two thank you super system yes
and we'll be announcing the winner for
that when Saturday or Sunday Sunday is
when it's on details so you guys have
another four days or so to enter this
yes the link is on my half if you go to
my half the little Paul channel
description you you need to click the
link to go over to the extra life page
in order to enter on the gleam do entry
yes you don't have to donate to the
extra life charity fundraising thing
that's not a raffle but you can if you
want this number could still go in
courier if you want to the other than
that though just feel free to enter and
it is we it is only open to North
America US Canada and Mexico though so
sorry to international people it's very
challenging for us to ship
internationally especially something
like a full-blown computer yeah but
there'll be more international giveaways
coming soon and stuff too from either of
our channels the good way we've also got
a case giveaway a be quiet sponsored
case giveaway on my channel this was
actually announced about a week ago you
guys can win either a dark base dark
base 700 or dark base Pro 900 both of
which are freakishly amazing cases I
think Dimitri from Hardware connects
gave the dark base Pro 900 the case of
the Year award last year 426 yeah and I
totally stand by that so these are both
fantastic cases the the dark base 700 is
more recent it came out like earlier
this month or last month it's got USB
type-c on the front panel it's a great
case all around I did a review on it you
can check that out so guys if you're
interested in a new case or if you're
just looking to build the new system and
you're not exactly sure where to start
or you'd like a free case just in
general go ahead and sign up for that so
those are the only few announcements
that we have here but let's dive in to
some tech news we have a lot to talk
about
starting with Visa Visa and
announcement that they're gonna be
implementing a new display HDR
specification just in order to make the
display is more consistent with with
with consumer expectations and things
like that this is an article from the
verge Vasa is the standards organization
for displays most of you are probably
aware or familiar with their visa
mounting system that we see on the back
of TVs and monitors and things like that
a vase amount which I'm sure a lot of
people out there have heard of a
seamount but didn't know that vase is
actually an organization that handles a
lot of the spec and the specifications
and Riis standards all the standards for
these panels as well not just the
mounting mechanism per se but they do a
lot of a lot of good work over there at
visa the organization is now trying to
make HDR hardware including TVs panels
monitors and stuff like that more
consistent with its new certified
display HDR standards and this is gonna
help consumers know kind of what they're
getting when they buy a product with a
display HDR certification badge which
kind of looks exactly like what Paul is
showing up there it's being split into
into several tiers three tiers to start
there will definitely be more tears that
come later as the technology advances
and so forth but right now we've got
display HDR 400 600 and a thousand all
three levels are required to support the
open HDR 10 spec or standard in order to
receive the certification but the
similarities kind of seem to end there
in order to hit the display HDR 400
standard a display only needs to offer
global dimming and reach a peak
luminance of 400 Candela per meter
squared or CD / M squared which is a
sort of a metric that you guys see often
it's basically a standard unit of
luminance of brightness or etc aka this
is sort of like you know if you see
display HDR 400 it's basically the bare
minimum of what an HDR recipient would
benefit from so it's it's the bare
minimum
it just it's you barely in the door to
HDR exposure but you know it's not super
high-end or anything display HDR 600
bumps that requirement up
ever so slightly to a peak luminance of
600 CD / M Squared 10 bit image
processing that's actually pretty huge
and specifies a lower minimum black
level and higher color gamut of course
and then finally you've got the top end
for now
display HDR 10 1000 takes that to an
even higher 1000 CD / M Squared and
local dimming so I guess I guess what
I'm saying is we might actually be able
to check out some of these certified
display HDR monitors and panels perhaps
at CES would be kind of cool to actually
see those put into play and and kind of
see what they look like I would love to
actually see the same image on a 400 600
and 1,000 display HDR panel challenge
there's yep you can sell yeah exactly
yeah and I think that'd be a really
interesting sort of sort of content
piece but that that's what's happening
on the vase at end because HDR you know
HDR 10 it's it's I think a standard like
this needs to happen because HDR can be
plastered pretty much on any product but
it doesn't necessarily mean that you're
getting the same benefit or the same
experience or same image quality across
all those devices you could have HDR and
one and on one product and HDR on
another but they could be completely
varying levels of quality and and color
gamut to be honest so there's really a
huge need for a standardization for this
newer technology that's starting to
infiltrate all of our displays so thanks
BAE suffer for for making that happen
next up we've got an article from the
hacker news I should mention the last
one oh yeah I didn't say the last one
was from the bridge this next articles
from the hacker news calm hacker news
this is about an actual security
researcher claiming to a found of
built-in key logger in several HP
laptops and he it started off as a tweet
I guess just a tweet to his followers
then he went fully public with his
findings basically finding that the key
logger was found in several HP laptops
that would ascend
let hackers record your every keystroke
and steal sensitive data which is
obviously bad and this includes things
like passwords account info credit card
credentials I mean this is serious stuff
guys if someone wanted to hack you and
you've got an affected HP model laptop
laptop model that's you know that's
that's prone to this vulnerability it
could be seriously bad news this is long
happened at least two times this year
yeah from HP alone that's it's kind of
shitty it's not there this is buy build
your own computer yeah fire my own build
your own computer you'll have zero
bloatware and you want to deal with
like this all you have to worry about is
Microsoft's buying any key that bricked
the ultimate bloatware your operating
system the key logger was found in the
sin tp'ed system file which is a part of
synaptics touchpad driver damn it's
inept we talked about synaptics and
paul's half had nothing to do with this
but the synaptics touchpad driver is
apparently containing this system file
that has that is basically a key logger
and it ships with more than 460 HP
laptop models you probably have one of
them HP acknowledges that the key logger
exists and they say that it's a debug
trace which was accidentally left in
what a clusterfuck of an accident that
is oopsies sorry yeah well sorry doesn't
cut it for everyone especially those who
have been hacked but fortunately the the
the key logger has been removed with a
patch update the driver updates been
released for all the affected notebook
models you can visit the HP support
website in order to first first of all
to see which notebook models have been
affected and then you can get the driver
update from there as well
like Paul just mentioned this is not
HP's first offense with a key logger
vulnerability in May of this year in
fact a built-in key logger was found in
an HP Audio Driver that was silently
recording all of its users keystrokes
and storing them in a human readable
file so the story the story for the
manufacturer side is these are software
tools that they develop as the product
is being developed right because they
need to do troubleshooting and they need
to be able to track what happens so if
there is an error or a failure or
something like that they can look back
that correct what caused this and then
oops like it just happened to have
stayed in the software and we didn't go
and make it up to the servers a updated
version that purged that or whatever um
and it's up to you dear viewers at home
to decide whether or not your you
believe them in their story but um I
think we need to take a brief pause here
to fully appreciate that Kyle yeah as
promised in my half of the show is about
to crack open a heady topper the heady
topper not the heady an topper I've
learned today on stream but just the
heady topper this is the alchemists
Vermont and I like how just on the top
here it says drink from the can drink
from the can drink from the can they
really just want you to drink from the
can they were saying don't pour this
into a nice fancy glass just drink it
the way it's intended can that's what
it's driven again that's built and I
like what they say on the back and their
little description here as well it's not
it's not intended to be the biggest or
most bitter it's meant to give you wave
after wave of hoppy goodness on your
palate tremendous amounts of American
hops will creep up on you and leave you
with a dense hoppy finish in your mouth
so drinkable it's scary all right I like
I like that mental image of a bunch of
American hops creeping up on me it's
kind of kind of kind of terrifying
actually
but Cheers cheers to you Paul and all of
you at home watching thank you very much
or at work wherever it's a good this
chat still enjoying that cider
oh that's good
believe ycy few sauces of course of
course you have to you just had to try
then good example mmm hey no no no come
back come on seriously
really Wow come on wow you're fired you
walked into my fist this is how spouse
abuse happens it's not your fault Paul
it's not your fault mommy and daddy
would never blame it on you salsa meme
the other day is like you know when
you're at your friend's house and their
parents are yelling at them oh it's too
real in a while it's too real yesterday
well then let's move on to our next star
a which is regarding the worst piece
each case trends of 2017 this is
actually on a YouTube video via Dimitri
at hardware connects our good friend and
pal and fellow youtuber he put together
a this fancy intro he's good this is you
know just something he does in random
videos it's not even something like an
intro that he does for all videos it's
just like hey I just decided to spend
five hours on this one 5 second clip in
my videos because I'm better than you
it's crazy
yep yep I hate you I hate you Dimitri so
I'm making us look bad well your fancy
 be what be rolling no I
love you I love you so much I love marry
me
so he put together this worst PC case
trends video of 2017 and who better to
really comment on computer cases than
Dimitri I mean he's been reviewing these
things extensively for so long
I would regard him as one of the best PC
case reviewers of all time in current
existence so I really took this video to
heart didn't look out everything he said
what Dimitri's goat he's a goat was goat
greatest of all time great symbols oh
yeah this is nice a nice fun accurate
acronym I'll start using now um so this
is uh this is just a brief rundown list
I suggest you still give him the view go
ahead and check out the video you can
hear a sexy Russian accent but we're
going to go down just a brief list of
the things that he pointed out as being
sort of not the greatest trends that
we've seen with peace each a seize this
year the first of which was a lack of
USB type-c integration and I feel like
this is a polarizing one because type C
is awesome it's reversible it has a lot
of functionality and it's it's just a
nice it's a nice connection especially
when you open it up to like USB 3.1 gen2
you get some really nice speeds 10
gigabits per second and all that jazz
it's nice to have that on the front
panel at the same time there are not
many devices that use USB type-c
currently let alone you know USB 2 gen 2
3.1 gen2 sure there so I feel like I'm
sure there are but in the grand scheme
of things it seems like we just pick up
your phone okay okay one on one is your
phone single example does not make your
argument of an overwhelming on which is
already know mine's a pix like cell is
able to it's the same family more or
less it's the same okay
I'm not one to knock USB type-c okay I
have a video that's already up on
floatplane about a slew an onslaught of
USB type-c devices there's like eight
different products that I took a look at
and it actually sort of did many reviews
on on that's coming to the YouTube
channel probably later this week just
lied to everyone no I didn't lie
everyone I'm just saying I'm just saying
it's like the knowledge the information
is still not out there as to how you
know how prevalence USB type-c is it's
still a long ways off to be honest okay
to be fair it's still a long ways off
from replacing micro USB as the as the
number one USB interface like my mom my
parents anyone in my family all my
friends if I showed up to their house
and said hey can you charge my phone I
guarantee you zero of them would be able
to help me so that's why I have an adept
that's why I have a micro USB to type C
adapter keychain on my keys because so
far you're peeking
I mean oh yeah I get super I'm peaking
on drugs um no yeah sorry so sorry
headphone users but I'm just saying
lack of types the integration on cases
is a polarizing matter but I feel like
it's a pretty loud minority that should
still be heard and listened to um I
would like to see more types II on on
cases I think especially the ones that
are being sold for over 120 130 hundred
fifty bucks should definitely have type
C just even if even if type C's not
quite where microUSB is right now it's
still the future and you're gonna have a
computer case ideally for more than a
year or two so you're gonna want to have
that built-in functionality ready to go
additionally he brought up that a lot of
cases this year were including cheap
generic black fans but he's not been a
fan of black then even some having molex
connections you know or or cheap LEDs
that's just like right there that just
don't look all that great I would agree
with that what what he said that really
stuck with me is that he would like to
see an oaf an option for certain cases
yeah I like that I really like that idea
I think case manufacturers should take
that comment to heart especially with
the super inexpensive cases the fans are
often a pretty significant part of the
cost if you're if you talk about a 40
$50 case that actually comes with two or
three fans in it yeah that's a pretty
decent chunk of the cost but beyond that
the higher-end cases like if you could
shave 15 or 20 bucks off of the cost and
give me it with no fans because I know
and I'm gonna swap it out with the fans
that I want to buy their 15 or 20 bucks
each anyway then that would make a lot
of sense and I wouldn't end up with just
a bunch of crappy that but the thing is
like they they wouldn't be able to shave
that much off like with the fans that
they're using they probably shave like 5
bucks off over 10 I would say I would
say like 5 bucks um but still I mean
it's still 5 bucks like for fans that
you're never gonna use that you're just
like like Paul said you're gonna replace
anyway I would still like to see the no
fan option just and also just based on
the principle that it's not wasteful
like I have so many case fans that I
just uninstalled immediately off of my
cases because I obviously replace them
with other
better fans that are just kind of
sitting there collecting dust it's just
a wasteful it's just a wasteful practice
it's just a you know bunch of cheap
plastic just sitting there collecting
dust that will never be used for their
intended purpose but moving on here a
lack of interior variety basically
Demetri was saying that there's sort of
this one formula that every case
manufacturer uses for their interior you
got your motherboard tray right there
you know you've got maybe some cable
management with the power supply shroud
and you know your your rubber grommets
on the right and the top etc you maybe
you got a drive bay on the right side
towards the front of the case you're
mounting a i/o mounts on the top and so
forth and I kind of get that it's it's
also one of those things where I'm like
well it doesn't really it's not like
it's not working out it's not like I
feel like anything's lacking in the
interior department so much rather than
I would like to see more innovation
right it's not look that it's bad it's
just that it's not innovative so I think
I I think that a lot of case
manufacturers this year played it safe
they weren't really trying bold new
risky types of interior layouts because
they were just sticking to what worked
and it was sort of that mentality of
like well if it's not broken don't fix
it type of thing so I kind of get both
sides of the argument but as a consumer
more than a more than a you know I'm not
a manufacturer at all but more as a from
a consumer standpoint I would love to
see more innovation in the interior
layouts for a lot of these popular cases
I think that's just moving and driving
the the whole industry forward the
market forward really and additionally
he brought up the issue sort of the same
thing with power supply shrouds while
it's really nice that we have power ship
our supply shrouds now on a variety a
wide variety of cases where we really
didn't a year or two ago he's saying
that it's sort of the same thing all the
features are seemingly copy pasted from
one case to the next you've got this
lower third shell that has maybe some
SSD mounts on the top you've got you
know a place to hide your cables maybe
you can remove
some of the the top panels like the dark
bass 700 in order to you know like there
you go perfect timing to stash more
cables through or to have maybe like a
reservoir or pump shine through and
things like that open up some radiator
support but you know I feel like there
might be I'm kind of with the me tree on
this one there could be more innovative
things that could be being done with
power supply shrouds he also mentioned
that cases are getting bigger have you
noticed that have you noticed cases
getting bigger I've seen lots of new
massive cases and I keep turning them
away like the cosmos 700 yeah I turned
that one away to I think part of it was
because it's just too big and I don't
want it taking up space but the other
thing is that I only seen the value in
really huge cases if you're gonna be
doing some custom water cooling know
that sounds sounds unpleasant though
that's good never is that okay don't
worry
all right well we'll circle back to that
I'm sure um but you know I think I think
cases are getting bigger because
manufacturers are pitching that pitching
the size as having more airflow where
that's not necessarily the case 100% of
the time just because you have a bigger
case doesn't mean you have more air
flowing through it you could have a
conversely you could have a smaller case
like a mini ITX even if it's a larger
mini ITX case having tons of airflow
going through it size doesn't
necessarily indicate air flow abundance
or deficiency in my opinion and I think
that's how a lot of these larger cases
this year we're being marketed as having
tons of airflow and we saw that as not
being necessarily true especially with
you know one of his next points being
that the airflow on a lot of these cases
I'm sure gamers Nexus would agree is
just especially from coming from
the front of the case where most of the
intake is coming from he Dmitri
mentioned the the H 500 P
and how that wasn't exactly everything
we hoped it would be cracked up to be
and and having just sort of a cutoff
system at the front panel where your
fans weren't able to breathe necessarily
even cases that seemingly had lots of
ventilation and mesh were not delivering
the amount of airflow that people were
anticipating simply because of the
positioning of the fans perhaps the the
front panel was just encroaching on them
too much even though they had tons of
mesh if the front panel is just a couple
like a millimeter or two away from your
from your fans you're not getting much
air through that mesh anyway any any
useful air anyway and yeah so I
definitely agree with that and I feel
like there was a huge emphasis sort of
an obsession with like silent cases and
having like the best acoustics ever and
so you'd have this really closed off
front panel for a lot of chassé ease
that just did not deliver the airflow I
think the message if I see right there
is a great is a great case that sort of
stays true to the older type cases where
it's just straight-up mesh straight-up
mesh on the front there's really nothing
impeding any sort of air flow from those
front intake fans which is sort of your
your first defense against overheating
I'm just getting pumping lots of air
flow through that front panel given the
given the reception of the H 500 P
especially with the air flow issues that
it had it definitely made it seem like
very kind of forward looking for fractal
to come out with the mesh if I when they
did oh yeah just being straight a solid
modern case with the tempered glass side
panel a lot of modern features but just
there like we're not blocking the front
at all just got air flow there so right
and and you know I think it's a lot of
it has to do with like honestly it's sad
but true but like people buy things
based on the way they look you know I
used to think I used to think that only
Apple fans bought Hardware because it
looked good but then like a while ago I
realize like no like PC enthusiasts buy
 because it looks good too I mean
why do you think RGB has taken off and
you know it's kind of like its own beast
now and the same thing goes for cases
like the H 500 P kind of with the
mentality that it looks really nice I
mean it's one of the arguably one of the
nicest looking cases of 2017 but as
gamers Nexus demonstrated has terrible
air flow and a lot of people were super
hyped about this case because terrible
okay
now you would expect given that it was a
case that came from a series that was
previously known for high airflow okay
then yeah I guess
terrible relatively speaking based on
how there was some what you would expect
from a series that was previously known
as AI air flow well and its current
series but because I mean know
everything everything that they all
right if you go back to the way cooler
master was pitching it like leading up
to CES and everything like that half
higher flow yes it was a continuation of
that series everything they said
afterwards because they realized like
they test these things themselves right
know to some degree right what the
shortcomings are yeah they're like it's
not actually a high airflow case it's
the H 500 P right and and so on so they
step back from that like branding it as
a high airflow case yeah and you know
people's response was was what it was
which was you know not the best right
but and I guess you if you're not
expecting it to be high airflow then
what's not a terrible case what else
would you expect from the only case in
2000 you're at hey boo I knew 100
millimeters in front integrands you're
right I'm playing double with African
head everything always been known to
pump out more airflow and higher CFM see
ya CFM then then like like smaller fan I
mean okay yeah I get it and there was
some sort of beating around the bush as
how that was marketed but I understand I
understand both sides really I do I'm
cracking open a
nation brewing and mosaic IPA an IPA yes
which is not a beer that you hate yeah I
might not be your PA
this is Vermont brew brewed and it says
we who wonder are not lost which is
paraphrasing of course of the verses
that go with Mithrandir and end here yes
I love it I love it um okay so moving on
sorry no that was completely incorrect
Aragorn I was I was gonna say I don't
know enough lore in that fandom my god
to correct you properly yes the blade
that was broken the cider the cider is
strong with this one
and then finally choked oh wait no I
already said that
so I mean honestly it's it's a pretty
good video it's a really good video you
guys just checking it out on hardware
connects thank you to meet you for
continuing to pump out really good
content Sal looks like he's fiddling
with our next link but that's okay
because we're gonna be talking about
some Rison to details that were recently
had some light on them this is an
article from WCC F Tech this is about
AMD's new lineup of 2000 series CPUs
codenamed Pinnacle Ridge risin 7 5 and 3
CPUs will debut on the 12 nanometer
process and it's gonna be in q1 2018
we're gonna be seeing risin 7 rising to
7 in February risin 5 and 3 in March and
they will be sporting the news and +
architecture microarchitecture which is
fantastic the new family is said to
bring in a nice batch of higher clock
speeds and better overclock ability to
the table in addition to support faster
ddr4 that's gonna be exciting hopefully
ddr4 pricing will drop because if
they're sticking with the same sort of
you know infinity fabric which I'm sure
they are high speed memory is going to
be in high demand and right now even low
speed memory is super outrageously
overpriced or just really expensive
right now
it's gonna be crazy if they're like you
know what Rison to performs best with
4000 megahertz ram people are gonna be
spending an arm and a leg on memory
unless the prices drop soon so hopefully
that also happens by you know hopefully
q1 q2 of next year we've also got you
know this is going to be a huge rival
there's gonna be a direct rival with
Intel's 900 series the follow-up to
coffee Lake which is going to be
expected around June 2018 of next year
and this is gonna bring 8 cores to team
Blues main stream platform for the first
time ever with I mean coffee like just
bringing the six core thing to the page
stream platform for the first time ever
and now we've got 8 cores it's gonna be
a huge competitor hopefully it'll be
hopefully it'll bring more competition
to rise in then coffee liked it I feel
like it would especially because we
hardly even have a stable inventory we
can hardly get supply of coffee like
right now I'm hoping that Intel doesn't
jump the gun for the 900 series and they
don't want it super early and it ends up
being a complete deficit of supply where
anywhere you can find a 900 series CPU
is 20 30 40 percent over MSRP very
similar to how coffee like this right
now so competition is good even with
sort of risin or I'm sorry AMD being the
underdog I'd still like to see Intel
step up to the plate and finally give
AMD a run for their money in the
mainstream market so assuming the WC CF
tech article we're looking at is is
accurate which is a bold allegation fall
you know this this one doesn't seem too
far out there seems pretty
straightforward but it is worth pointing
out the difference here between the
upcoming series is of processors that
are based on Zen architecture from AMD
so what we have right now summit ridge
based on the Zen the og Zen CPU
architecture what Kyle's talking about
which is coming up codenamed Pinnacle
Ridge is based on Zen Plus which is a
refinement but also appears to
potentially be a die shrink and I don't
believe this is confirmed but seems
pretty likely that they're moving from
see an animator 212 nanometer mm-hmm and
then again like yeah he said maybe maybe
higher core counts we're not really sure
but should still be the aim for socket
and that that's what we're looking at
the beginning of 2018 Zen sue is the
actual second generations and
architecture so that's like if you're
looking at this kind of like the
tick-tock thing like with Intel it'd be
a tick and then a talk I guess going
from zen to Zen plus is in to write is
then to potentially down to seven
nanometer which would be pretty huge and
obviously this is further out so more
speculative but also 2019 so yeah but
but just just to keep it in your head
Zen Zen plus Zen to like all different
things but Zen plus 28 teens into
probably 2019 yeah it's a little bit
confusing
I get tripped up myself sometimes but
thank you for the clarification Paul the
other thing to note is that there's
still very little known about this m+
microarchitecture though the 12
nanometers should mean higher clock
speeds and better power efficiency with
those transistors being closer together
we've got board makers releasing the X
470 and X 450 models I just lowered my
chair just like shrunk the small
mushroom and X 450 models based on new
400 series chipset designs so it's gonna
be the 400 series chipset it's very
exciting I think the most exciting part
about all of this though or one of the
most exciting things is that we're still
using the same AM for socket that we've
seen on X 370 and B 350 I think that's
great
so if so up grandma so if Andy wants to
maintain goodwill from people who
invested in AM Ford when it comes to
these new series chipsets they need to
not feel like you like you need to get
the new chipset motherboard in order to
get the most out of these new processors
right and how would they do that
honestly like maybe disabled
overclocking or something like that door
or if they had some ridiculously awesome
feature that was only on 400 series
chipsets
it's there's different there's different
different ways they could do things that
they could do but like probably the the
most fundamental change would be access
to PCI Express Lanes and those are laid
out yeah
and if if then Plus does have more PCIe
lanes somehow like if you would need the
new chipset in order to access those or
something like that right which could be
a make or break thing depending on how
you're looking at that potential upgrade
path but yeah for anyone who you know
was thinking AMD's gonna let me take my
am for you know X 370 motherboard that I
bought at the beginning of 2017 and
still being using it in 2019 for Xen 2
CPUs with no noticeable drop back in you
know feature support or or speed or
something like that like I don't know I
don't I don't know how that I don't know
how it's gonna I'm uncomfortable I'm
cool with them like having additional
features but the 400 series chipset that
you can't get in the 300 series chipset
as long as it's not they mean because
you're a extra extra yeah if you're a
power user if you're like a hardcore
workstation freak and you're doing tons
of rendering or you need those nvme
drives in there with additional PCIe
lanes then okay then yeah like throw
that into the 400 series chipset but if
you make it to the point where it's not
even practical or we're feasible to to
drop you know a 2000 series CPU into
your X to be 70 motherboard then it's
kind of like you're you're trying to
milk you're trying to milk the truth
really it's like yeah we made it
supported yeah you can it's technically
backwards compatible or forwards
compatible but you're it's sideways
sideways what I don't
yeah sideways sideways compatible but
but you're not gonna want to do it
because we're offering so much other
good stuff on the new platform that
you're gonna want to switch anyway so
it's got to be fair it's got to be fair
to consumers and where you draw the line
is kind of
blurry nvme connectivity as far as
number of devices the number of lanes
I'm sure about to be something that they
could segment out but yeah it just
depends on how they want to do it and
what they want to keep for the next-gen
versus the current gen yeah we'll see
what they decide moving on though but
yeah um fun stuff with resin - let's
move on to pit my PC let me take a look
at some of your guys's systems that you
guys submitted on Twitter's and tell you
how to maybe improve the look or overall
quality of your build first up we've got
one from Dylan and doesn't look like
he's got any specs provided so we're
just gonna have to sort of guess here
does look like he's got in asrock rise
and Taichi motherboards so it's probably
an X 370 board with perhaps the rice and
seven CPU it's pretty nice board so I'd
imagine with an NZXT crack and cooler on
there looks very nice and then s340
perhaps an elite with the GTX Andrews
Edition card of some sort I would
imagine it's either a gtx 1070 1080 1080
TI does have sli fingers on it so it's
not a ten sixty and yeah looks like
you've got some tread in z RGB in there
fantastic components here all around but
let's see what can we do to help you out
here doing I would say the first order
is getting some sleeved extensions
perhaps those can go a long way in
making your system look a little bit
more showy and a bit more presentable
the fans also is is a huge thing that
it's a huge factor that can sort of add
to the personality or characteristic of
your overall system so you've got the
pretty much you know the sort of stock
stock fans from NZ Eckstein here the
ones quite frankly the ones that Dimitri
was complaining about in his top worst
trends of PC cases in 2017 s-video so
they're just cheap black fans and not
saying that there's anything wrong with
them but if you really want to sort of
make it your own and you've already got
the beefy main components in hand then
you know it's time to start looking at
aesthetics sure maybe swapping those out
it's also kind of interesting
you've made that top fan in intake don't
really see that too often looks like
it's an intake fan at the top so you
want to be bringing some air from the
top inside of your case most people have
that as an exhaust cool it as V RMS cool
and cool of your arms perhaps I mean or
you could be exhausting hot air coming
off of your vrm is either way but you
know sure sure why not I'm like I'm
lucky for it because I'm sure that
doesn't make a huge huge difference it
might not be the best if you don't have
a dust filter out there that's what I
was gonna say is the dust buildup might
be an issue I'm gonna say the the
stockin or the Nvidia reference design a
cooler here is what stands out to me as
far as just clashing a bit with the
green because it's got green oh yeah
other than that we've got mostly black
white and it looks like you got some
purple going on with the LEDs although
granted you can change the colors of
those of course yeah oh yeah that's
that's what clashes most to me other
than that everything I mean things are
pretty well coordinated and stuff and
the cable management I feel like you've
done the best you can with um you know
barring the use of extensions or
something like that right to make just
things look a little a little prettier
all around so very nice very nice clean
build though yeah okay thanks Dylan
Thank You Dylan next up we've got one
from Takeshi Takeshi 7um Takeshi thank
you very much for submitting your system
the sooner you feature this one the
sooner I can stop posting it alright
great
again no real specs here we just kind of
have a couple pictures oh wait I'm sorry
yes you did include it we've got a
Pentium II or 99 65 overclocked for
threads at 4.2 6 gigahertz a GTX 480
from Nvidia and Asus p5q which is on the
p45 chipset from Intel we have 8 gigs of
hynix ddr2 800 speed and it's the cooler
cooler master master liquid 240 Corsair
obsidian 450d nice little case there
raid max Thunder beat to power supply
and it says here that your CPU is
getting temps over 90 degrees Celsius I
can lower it to 4 gigahertz to drop it
275 see
I think 9dc is a little bit too warm
breath I would I would drop it somewhere
between 4 gigahertz and 4.2 6 you know
if you can get if you can stay under 80
if you can stay under 80 that's
generally what I recommend but apart
from that it looks like you've got
interesting motherboard because we have
a 24-pin connector on the very left of
the motherboard whereas we usually see
it on the right that kind of forced you
to to wire the cable and it's sort of
weird and maybe not so ideal path over
your graphics card and it sort of looks
a little messy also the blue fan isn't
really doing it for me on the power
supply if you want to flip that I know
the 450d does have a power supply dust
filter on the bottom so you could look
into that obviously the ketchup and
mustard on your PCIe cables and 24-pin
are not doing any favors so perhaps look
into getting some black slave extensions
if you are if you feel like if you plan
on sticking with your current hardware
like the main platform of your system
for a while you're not planning to
upgrade anytime soon
then you know you can have some spare
money to invest into aesthetic
aesthetics
let's see there's a nasty label black
with a sticker on your on your fan on
the rear rear exhaust fan which you
could have removed this one
it's a barcode barcode okay get rid of
that yeah why get rid of that and you
know I think um that I mean you've got
sort of gold color scheme here because
your your motherboard obviously it
doesn't really have much to match up
with so I don't know if you want to go
all-out you could get some like nice
fancy cables that are black and gold
sleeved that's something that you could
look into obviously you could maybe get
some new RAM that has actual heat
spreaders instead of just the bare PCBs
that you know maybe you could spray
paint gold or something like that try to
color match the heatsinks on your
motherboard I think that would look
really nice it would be fairly
affordable too you know apart from
having to buy a new Ram kit that would
be expense
actually but yeah that's all I got
anything you want to add Paul get rid of
that red Santa cable yeah not really I
mean it's just it's it's a it's a it's a
much older system when it comes to the
core components in there so you're not
dealing with parts that were designed
with as much of an aesthetic
consideration in mind
so yeah it's harder to it's harder to
color coordinate and it's also harder to
say here's the money you should invest
in this when you know they're one
dimensional system with ddr2 memory yeah
it's nearing the end of its useful life
right that's what we are to ddr's in
front of it ahead of it so yeah I agree
but thank you Karen priors
7 for sending that in next to please got
one from Rolando with his 4770k z97
gaming 5 motherboard from MSI excuse me
ROG Strix gaming GTX 1080i and enthu Pro
M love that case and some ballistics
sports 16 gig ddr3 kit from crucial um
you know the first thing that stands out
to me here is is that your top two fans
are different top two fans are different
it looks like they have different blade
patterns one two three four five six
seven one two three four five six seven
eight nine you're right I don't know why
that stood out to me one has nine blades
and one has seven blades and what I
would say is just use the same fans
throughout your entire system so if you
have three it looks like you might have
two or three of the same fans in here I
would just say buy more of those same
fans and replace all the other ones in
your case that are not alike flagging
flag and dry and Chet says it looks like
maybe a 140 you know and a 120 which is
possible it doesn't you have the one on
the left is wider yep and the one on the
right yep I couldn't even less it's like
true might be a wide-angle thing or
something probably not but no I think I
think he's right that's actually true
the one on the left does look a bit
bigger
yeah so that's something to also
consider I mean just for a uniform look
I mean again if we're talking aesthetics
here functionally it looks like you're
pretty good to go man
1080i and a 4770k you're flying you're
good no need to upgrade core components
anytime soon but so at this point you
can spend the extra money or any money
you have on on looks and appearance so I
would say get some new fans in there
extensions extensions are always gonna
be something that adds to the overall
look of your system at least for the 24
pin and your PCIe MSI z97 gaming 5
motherboard apparently has a green
debugging debug LED was the thing really
know why I did not know that that was
the thing but why would it be green
that's very strange I've never noticed
that I've seen that before
um disable ya disable it you can if you
can because it's definitely clashes yeah
we're taping up beyond that there's a
blue light here I'm not sure if that's a
reflection of something or if that's I
know it's gotta be on the cooler part of
the cooler I feel like that's part of
its also clashing just a little bit
looks like you have a brace on here to
prevent GPU sag which is mostly it looks
like I still load up here a little bit
of sag going on there it's hard to say
for sure but I don't know I mean ok the
cable management super clean yeah so
this is good so you know that looks
pretty good there I like the included a
shot of the back kill management as well
nice kill manager in the bash I think
you've done a pretty good job with yeah
so yeah I mean it's good it's not a
whole lot to be done as far as you know
other than you know getting some where's
the investing a little bit more in
aesthetic stuff like heal cable
extension is that kind of thing yeah
very nice building thanks for Wanda next
up we've got Michael he's the person who
donated on YouTube to get featured oh
hey okay
8700 K 5 gigahertz gigabyte Z 370 gaming
7 motherboard 16 gigs of Vengeance ddr4
EVGA CLC 280 1080 GT X 1080 for the 1/2
and a super nova g3 750 watt with an H
500 P with front panel mesh mod and X 3
R 3 cable mod addressable RGB strips oh
alright so you're pretty much decked out
in the aesthetic Department it looks
like and looks like you have a pretty
nice setup of hardware here something
that most people would kill for let's
see what what could we add what we add
here the mesh mod on the H 500 P mesh
I wasn't sure when I saw gamers Nexus do
that if that was something that gamers
Nexus was just gonna make up or if
anyone is actually gonna do it it looks
like yeah people follow the suit that's
awesome though that's gonna drop your
degrees according to gamers Nexus is
testing up to 10 degrees Celsius which
is huge so that's great I would say
honestly you have really clean cable
management here the the cabin looks
pretty straight there are a few little
loopy cables up here they'll be
tightened up below maybe could be
tightened up a little bit also you got
the EVGA close look cooler that has the
unfortunate kind of USB plug on the
bottom of it that this room not a whole
lot you can do with yeah unfortunate
position but yeah I don't know if you
could tuck that down a little bit maybe
but find it a whole lot I see that there
is an additional what looks like maybe
an 80 or 90 millimeter fan down here
yeah for example that's an interesting
addition I don't wonder if time is
anything I'm not sure how much benefit
that would provide but ok sure
also it's just seems to be right up
against the expansion brackets or the
the PCIe looks like he's got some red
zip ties yeah
holding it down to the case I like I
like that you've got a little mascot in
here the little Skelton dude Ahmed
that's cool that's Ahmed Ahmed from I
think it's the Jeff Dunham I've been
true of quests that's one of his
characters oh yeah um nice nice I can
build overall I like the kind of black
black and white and silver thing you got
going on I will say the mesh mod just
looking at some of the pictures on the
front it doesn't look as clean as when
the plastics on there but of course of
course you got to take the performance
benefits over the aesthetics I think in
that situation right so very nice build
there Michael well done yeah done sir
kind of like similar to the last build I
feel like the cable extensions would be
kind of the next step for you right but
not necessary by any stretch yeah just
to top it off I'd say some some nice
black sleeves extensions would go nicely
but thank you very much Michael next
we've got cryptic ninja with Verizon
five 1600 CPUs cooler Asus crosshair six
hero eight gigs of crucial memory MSI
GTX 960 2 gig EVGA a 50 BQ and blah and
a $40.00 cooler case all right well
there's your problem
yeah the case which I mean $40.00 it's a
functional case I have built in this I
think I'm not sure if it's exist this
exact case but I've built in a $40
cougar case and it's definitely
immediately the weak points in the
builds yeah but let's you get everything
put together and functional but doesn't
let you position stuff this curler
looking like a thousand dollar bill
yeah but instead it looks like a $400
build because of the case but that said
before you upgrade your case I would add
another 88 memory stick just to give
yourself two by eight I don't know maybe
it's preferable if you're multitasking
yeah if you're gaming while streaming or
if you're gaming while wiping and
browsing the web then definitely and
check here check your system usage check
your resources
see am i maxing out my eight gigs or am
I like I'm like Dom only 50% brah I also
want to say that a 320 gig mechanical
hard drive is is more of a liability
than a benefit at this point who knows I
mean I mean it seems like probably a
drive that was carried over from an old
system or something like that which I
can understand but I would I would clear
that out at some point just because 320
gigs for a 3.5 inch drive just the the
amount of size and power that that's
taking compared to amount of storage
you're getting it's not that good of a
trade-off I think you should upgrade his
GPU first GPU first I think so I mean
cousin say alright 62 just cuz the risin
5 1600 can definitely handle more than
that you're right and I feel like if you
are if you are gaming with this system
then you could afford to upgrade the GPU
I mean the gtx 960 is already not super
fast as it is but the fact that you're
also dealing with a 2gig frame buffer
especially with modern games I feel like
even lower end games are starting to
push the bandwidth of two gigs so it
might be time to upgrade your GPU before
anything else and then have those things
follow suit I don't know a gtx 1066
gigabyte would be a nice upgrade i think
yeah that's not gonna set you back too
much especially if you can you know sell
some parts maybe the gtx 960 might be
slightly more practical given the memory
prices right now - so yeah true that
yeah new case new graphics card add a
little bit more memory all those things
and then resubmit resubmit - yeah a pc
yeah cuz your cable management already
looks like it's in the right direction
so i think with a better case you'd be
even cleaner yeah very much more to work
with day thanks everyone who submitted
for pin my pc we will be doing this
again either next episode or the one
after that so don't get discouraged if
we didn't pick you this time around but
thank you wrote to everyone who did
submit next up we've got the gamers
report leave over some of these really
quickly because I didn't honestly have
too much time to take super notes
each of these articles so we'll just
kind of run through them quickly the
first ones from PC Gamer it's basically
highlighting warhammer to laboratory
which is a new sort of free Skaven
laboratory update it's the free Skaven
laboratory update it's got a bunch of
sliders that you can tweak and this is
to change things like the level of
gravity in the game monster size and
there's a unit slider which will
probably crash your system when max down
so the reason why this this article
caught my attention is because it seems
like a fun tool or a fun toy to mess
with to test your CPU strength because
if you look at that I mean those are
each individually rendered warriors and
you can increase the unit size so that
you have literally thousands of these
tiny warriors on screen it's kind of
like remember like the Total War Shogun
number how that was like huge in terms
of like texting your CPU and seeing how
much you can handle this is sort of the
modern version of that where you can
adjust all these different parameters to
really put your CPU through its paces
and obviously that's not the initial
intent the original intent of the
developer it's more so just for
entertainment because it's a game but
for all of us enthusiasts who are
benchmarking constantly and who care
about CPU performance this could be a
fun toy to mess around with I mean you
could literally mess around I could mess
about with this for hours changing the
different sliders changing the gravity
settings if you change the gravity
settings as soon as like one warrior
bashes into like an army of rats the
rats all go flying and it's just like a
almost like a particle effect of rats
just flying through the air that could
you know affect your frame rate one way
or another some super exciting I would
just like to see this many textures
being rendered at once on screen and
seeing how different CPUs are handling
it because often times games are
primarily GPU bound and there are there
are very few games these days that are
primarily CPU bound and I feel like this
is perhaps an interesting tool
that could appeal to a lot of benchmark
reviewers and things like that just
because it is so CPU demanding so I
would like to check this out it's free
I have Warhammer - if you have Warhammer
- Paul already has it he's one step
ahead of the crew and I would highly
suggest that you maybe do a video on it
or something Paul because I think that'd
be something interesting that a lot of
us would like to see if you tested this
sort of download this this game with so
it's different views sorry are you know
watching porn while I do my half of the
show porn at all what are you talking
about so I have my doubts just just okay
um moving on though just a quick little
tidbit on Warhammer - let's move on to
our next article which is about
overwatch folks at Blizzard this is from
PC games and comm overwatch is is now re
reforming reformatting it's a reporting
tool one of the most requested tools for
mitigating the toxicity in game has
finally landed as part of the winter
wonderland of an event patch apparently
there's like lots of issues with
overwatch players being just dicks being
royal dicks either in the game chat or
from hacking or cheating or whatever
there's a lot of toxicity and finally
Blizzard has taken some steps against
these toxic people because with the
winter wonderland event patch if you now
report a player and blizzard takes
action against said player and their
account
look at these two dudes just sitting
there talking about video games like
people want to hear with that I love
video games I love it I play them all
the time yeah yeah you know lately just
look at the posters behind us bro blew
the posters clearly anyway that's what
we're talking about now now if you
report a player and Blizzard takes
action against their account you will be
notified that your report was heard and
you'll be notified in-game you've not an
email
not some kind of text message but you'll
actually be notified in-game hey that
person you reported it for being a dick
is now banned so there you go the show
this kind of shows gamers that they're
being heard and the developers are on
their side it encourages gameplay across
across all of their uh the demographic
dicks will get warnings mm-hmm dick
holes will get warnings if they're being
assholes like the assholes they are if
they're being close to if they're
getting close to being suspended or
banned they will get warnings now saying
hey your behavior has been kind of
shitty because you've been a dick knock
it off or you'll get banned or suspended
or what have you so that's it it's just
that it just it seems like the level of
communication between the developers and
the toxic people and the regular gamers
is just sort of strengthening with this
latest patch update that's good see but
you you report someone yeah you get
feedback they man yeah exactly then you
get a century then you get a sense of
pride and accomplishment pride of
accomplishment and also the sense that
do you feel like your reporting is
actually doing something because I feel
like with me when I report something I
often feel like there's no resolve like
I feel like there's no like that's the
end that's the last thing I'll ever do
and that's the last thing I'll ever see
about this case that I have and that
I'll never know if my report was ever
read or sent or heard or ever acted upon
and this is this is good validation that
people's voices are being heard anytime
they're being they feel like they're
being wronged didn't you know while
playing this game I don't have a sense
of pride and accomplishment right now
you sure do and why should you not also
thank you I was getting carried away
quite literally probably slipping slowly
out of frame be just as you just want to
scale this whole this whole room right
now and finally our last story here is
from PC gamer once again about just a
quick little review on fallout 4
Villar this is one of the first triple-a
titles to ever get a VR treatment and it
really does seem according to PC gamer
like a full-fledged fall for ya
we'll skip we'll skip the we'll skip the
skin betting cuz it's someone cares
about this BB it's a BBC article
no one cares no one cares maybe see
fallout 4 is getting it right by
including or implementing VR it's been a
great VR implementation according to the
folks at PC Gamer the VAT system is one
of the best parts about the game instead
of allowing you to target a specific
area or areas on your enemy or enemies
and then watching your attacks play out
into a cinematic view the VATS system in
VR works more like a traditional bullet
time effects the time slows down and you
aim with the controller you feel a lot
more connected to the action so instead
of just having like an automated like
select your targets and then press a
button and then just watch a cinematic
like a cinematic clip of all your
enemies just getting shot down you're
actually doing the shooting yourself and
it feels a lot more immersive but it
sort of in a bullet time sort of sense
so you feel like you're just you have
like a Deadeye like you're like a you
know like a Red Dead Redemption type of
effect or a Max Payne effect if you will
which is pretty cool it sounds super
cool sounds super cool I really want to
try fallout 4 in VR it sounds awesome
the pip-boy
however doesn't translate this well the
pip-boy was like you're sort of like a
menu screen where you you know have it
on your wrist or whatever you actually
have to hold up your wrists in order to
use it and you have to use a d-pad on
one of the the vibe controllers to
actually navigate which I mean if you
would imagine a d-pad versus mouse and
keyboard it's not quite as efficient so
where the that system gets it right
the pip-boy kind of falls or kind of
pales in comparison at the end of the
day though the remarks were
overwhelmingly positive for for this
particular title for for Fallout 4 VR
and it's a good sort of these decorating
is yeah it's it's like the sims
all-in-one wrapped up into one so it's a
good benchmark for
other triple-a title games to follow if
they're trying to implement their or
trying to make their game into VR trying
to make it be our friendly
okay I'm this is this is the model you
should follow if you're a triple-a game
developer and you're looking to make
your get your next game
vr friendly whereas doom VFR or doom VR
has not been receiving the same sort of
positive marks as this particular title
no where as you know duke doom v vr
seems to be more of like a doom
simulator than an actual play game play
playthrough of do I haven't read it yet
I haven't tried to get either but I feel
like I've heard that the movement is
really bad like you have to like
teleport and when you're not teleporting
it just feels very you feel like you're
on Rails type of thing where it doesn't
feel like you're actually because
because the thing about doom is that
what makes the game is the Pacey you
know what I mean you're constantly
jumping around the map you're moving if
you're idle at any point you're dead you
have to constantly move around and I
feel like that's a huge challenge of VR
because how do you make the user jump
around the map without teleporting and
not feel completely nauseous so I feel
like the their their solution to that
was just sort of either make you
teleport anyway or to have you kind of
casually move around the map and and not
really grasp the whole mechanism of a
fast-paced gaming chat sleepy was
traditionally chat said that doom VR is
poopy do pretty much accurately summed
up by a lot of the critics that I've
read on online so far so that's an
object yeah it is unfortunate and let's
see is the fallout 4 is the Fallout
series is what Bethesda I believe so
yeah they're pathetic and doom is did
yeah right okay so two different
developers two different approaches
obviously the one for the festive worked
out a little bit better this time around
so hopefully we've seen more Triple A
games implementing they are in a
positive way and and yeah I mean I think
things are gonna just look upward from
here just a little
all that do be our we want a
full-fledged Triple A game in VR we
don't want some sort of simulation of
that game that happens to play well with
VR so uh thank you very much
PC gamer for that article I think we can
go ahead boom is also also Bethesda
dooms also Bethesda so it's a chat says
which is really weird cuz I thought it
was Bethesda but it just doesn't make
sense to me that the fallout 4 rendition
in VR would do so well and yet they
would flop so heavily on the doom
version of VR they might have been to
the air production there might have been
different individual production that's
why I'm thinking maybe it'd worked on
the VR version of Doom and Bethesda took
control of their fallout 4 version I
don't know I'm not sure
Bethesda publishes it games all this is
coming straight from from twitch chat I
trust I trust twitch chat holy they are
the masses just the publisher I mean
twitch it might as well be both good
luck but this is why we should never do
the games report right so oh yeah yeah I
mean come on we mainly focus on tech
tech news and even that's a stretch so
for us to be report really accurately
reporting on games I mean I think we've
been accurate super accurate alright so
let's go ahead and why don't we do it

Joseph T for the donation Fred right
hundred dollars hundred holy crap Kyle
here is wyfy sauce and your $100 Merry
Christmas by the way someone said I was
your nemesis no idea why me you there
Fred here's the deal if Paul sets up the
straw poll I requested and you honor it
I will give Paul 100 and you 200 you
must honor for either payout I feel like
I'm on one of those sadistic like game
shows or like like Fred rants just a
super like rich billionaire and he's
just now looking for ways to entertain
his sick self by by playing off of the
common people forcing us to do
horrendous things is this for amusement
is this drop hole the question he asked
on my half yeah one through four I think
it was the options one through four of
what I would have Terry pie in the face
I think number four was you know why he
sauces choice which but okay we will
keep that request but to be paying my
next time in mind for Fred I'm sure why
few stops will be in contact so we have
the punishments lined up I am clearly
excited by your offer and as I am
terrified
k3 seven oh seven twenty dollars I have
an rog extreme ex $2.99 and seventy nine
20x I'd kept getting random frizzy took
out all but one dim and it works still
need to update BIOS buddy guys think
it's the BIOS or a bad mobo slash Ramji
skill RJ
let me 632 gigs you met have a bad a bad
stick didn't ya bad stick memory is
often the culprit for crashing and
random freezing like that you could do
you could easily do a Windows memory
test demand tests you can run them check
mm check that could help load it up on a
USB Drive and then load it up that would
be a possibility yeah do your do your
BIOS update though I mean check that see
if it changes anything
yeah good luck chances are yeah a bad
memory stick isn't isn't uncommon also
not the end of the world should be
replaceable pretty easily yeah Rosario
50 dollars you guys are awesome for the
weekend livestream you hero nailed it
now you guys should switch hairstyles
and facial hair in the future for a
streamer to possible ok me me being
Balder somehow we keep circling back to
me being bald no we're not bald but just
very little hair like Paul has I don't
know why my facial hair to be you kind
of already had my facial hair for the
stream sorry I didn't know vem beard
already yeah he already here da da had
succumbed to to the beard member so I
don't know I don't think I would ever
shave my head bald I just don't know how
you sound like swap for a day or
something like that doesn't seem
physically yeah that seems like it's a
trap you're you it's a trick it's a
trick request just shave your head for a
day no it doesn't work that way
then put it back put it back just just
for a day no sign but thank you very
much for the $50 donation nonetheless
Raul we appreciate it sir is easy our
hearty for the 10 Australian considering
considered doing a bunk or Bo I'd NC
grid computing build I do not know much
about that haven't you haven't
considered that myself it's more of a
specific application very niche so yeah
we know to figure out how much interest
there is in that and that type of thing
yeah so not much I guess would be the
answer to be back in Tosh before you do
one of those ok Tom's brems myths for
the 100 Norwegian Cronus sadly watch
only 2 hours live rests 10 hours I
watched offline because time zones
I work at night so awesome hardware is
so much better than Spotify by the way
why did you why you didn't use to color
fluid in the elite belt the reason why I
didn't use two different colors in the
elite belt was because I didn't really
have another color that I felt would
match the silver there's separate loops
all about well two different loops one
for the CPU and one for the GPUs
interesting honestly I like the uniform
I like the uniform I don't think that
it's mandatory that just because you
have two loops you have to use two
different colors I think a lot of the
appeal for me comes from the fact that
you get two freakin reservoirs right
next to each other that look awesome and
the fact that you're cooling two
separate components main components of
your system independently of each other
which is great for the fact that if I
happen to be rendering or something
we're pretty much all the load is on the
CPU the CPU is unencumbered or the GPU
is unencumbered by one loop or the other
like the CPU gets all the attention from
that loop and the GPU doesn't get
sacrificed because of it I don't know I
guess I was just so happy with the
Primeau chill view and how it looked in
one loop that I was just like let's fill
it with the other I did consider at a
certain point to fill the second loop up
with just distilled water to have sort
of a more clear look hmm just have a
more crystal-clear look but I just I
don't know I I'm very uniform in that
sense I just it was a personal choice
it's personal choice there's no right or
wrong so but thank you very much hi Evan
I need to answer the next two questions
I was about to go and take a pee break
but then I realized the next two
questions are both kind of directed at
me so ah moved for eleven ten dollar
donation said hey guys really enjoyed
playing overwatch with you guys during
the charity stream how much we enjoy
playing with you I remember moot my mood
and annoying Paul as tracer yes yes I he
killed me Congrats on surpassing your
donation goal goal also enjoy that hey
topper we're jealous oh yeah I'm
enjoying it a joy certainly am enjoy it
well mmm Thank You mood thanks for
joining us and
during the stream and everything it was
really great to play games with all
y'all that was super fun asdf asdf $5
donation Paul from your store what size
shirt do you wear and what's your
experience with shrinking the site has
that info but I'd like your input cheers
I were a large size large and it shrinks
ever so slightly but not extensively and
this is a large on me and that's just
fine nice this also is a shirt from the
same store by the way oh yeah my my
secret epic pants my secret is like I
actually hang dry I live with some wifey
sauce I hang dry all my shirts and my my
actual like nice jeans that's stupid
it's not stupid that's - it's not stupid
at all because your shirt stays the same
size as the day you bought it which like
when I'm trying something on I want it
to remain that size putting anything in
the dryer especially on high heat will
invariably shrink it so all my shirts
are the exact same size of the day I
bought them that's all my graphic tees
all the t's from my own store ones that
I've got from tech syndicate or you know
Paul's Hardware wherever I do not put
any of my good in the dryer I hang
dry all that and it was a huge
learning curve for me and sort of
something that I had trouble adopting at
first because it's more time and effort
it's easy to just throw something in
your in the dryer have the Machine do it
but you know it takes more time and
effort to actually hang up all that
but the end result is that I never run
into like a my favorite shirt that no
longer fits me you know especially as I
increase in my in my own personal size
and physicality getting fatter by the
day I need to make sure that the dryer
isn't putting me at any store to
physical disadvantage on its own so
those are my two cents Jay don't sue me
ah next up we've got a donation from MB
67 with the 13 no 37 cents elite as
Kyle speaking of your discussion of
cases and sizes I'm going to be doing a
couple of small form-factor builds to
challenge myself in 2018 the Dan case a
for SFX v2 excellent choice and
love ghost s1 allow now loga oh good the
Dan case a four that's gonna be fun
I I wish I had ahead one of those on
hand to actually build in I think that's
gonna be a really fun sort of
challenging build the low ghost s1 I'm
not super familiar with so let's see we
got we got so you've got see we got Luke
okay okay this looks very similar to
what's the the damn thing in the end in
case m1 it's kind of similar looks like
it still supports a fully ATX power
supply but perhaps even smaller than the
end case m1 not sure if it has support
for an AI Oh like that case does but
okay um honestly I'm all for a mini ITX
challenge I think it's great
definitely forces you to sort of think
outside the box in how you're going to
you know which parts you're really gonna
use I think part choice is very
important in that sense but I wish you
the best of luck MB 67 be sure to tweet
me some pictures of the system systems
whenever you're done
next time we've got dingo my forty for
the five bucks thank you very much no
comment appreciate dingo michael Percoco

Fred Radley $5 actual question which
would you recommend one thick radiator
or two thin ones if room not an issue I
go too thin if cream isn't an issue yeah
I would say you have more surface area
you would have more surface area in
general I guess every room and cost
because if you're talking about radiator
and also talked about more fans so
that's an issue to consider as well but
and if if that's not concern then I
would go more radiators yeah I would
agree with that
well dome is me $5 the the final back
here thanks for all you guys do first
tip and it just feels right yeah well
yeah just the tip baby please describe
the please describe the ideal awesome
hardware company Christmas party who do
you hire for Santa we hired J's to sense
he's Santa because he's like lovable but
also kind of grumpy yeah kind of grouchy
like Santa you would imagine would be in
a real-life scenario and then we'd have
like we host it either in your your
place or my place here in the studio
maybe you have a bartender be a build
your own PC area build your own PC area
but like the host of the build your own
PC area would be dressed up like elves
because they're building like building
toys they're building PCs and then let's
see there'd be lots of eggnog which with
alcohol in it of course the bar for sure
open bar tons of alcohol like lots of
alcohol and then more alcohol and then
what else all right call me crazy and
this very specifics and my strippers I
totally wants to Patti oh go ahead
yeah just build just go ahead it's not
exactly what I was going for but okay
yeah I was just joking so we oh we like
when we would have family over on
Christmas Eve every year and my mom
would always go to this local deli and
get this like tray of it's like lunch
meats
that's not likely it's like it's like
nice deli meats and
and rolls and stuff like that dude and
then you just like MACUL sandwiches
for some reason that always became
associated with Christmas even I know
it's not typically that like like oh
