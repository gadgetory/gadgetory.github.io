and sounding okay on your end let me
know if that's not the case and I'll
scramble to fix things but hopefully we
don't need to do that this time around
welcome this is a live build that I will
be doing today
with the help of wifey sauce who's
currently behind the camera she'll come
in front of the camera soon enough after
after she helps me man that for a bit
but yeah we're basically celebrating the
launch of the mesh fic which is a
mid-tower case from fractal design it's
brand-new just launched today you might
have already seen some other youtubers
go live with their their videos or their
reviews but I'm going to be doing a live
build so it should be kind of fun things
will be things will be crazy and
sporadic and impulsive I thank you all
so much for joining everyone hello I see
you all in chat yeah hello hello hi
everyone okay so um price point on this
guy is $89 it features a tempered glass
side panel which is very much a first
from fractal design they finally hopped
on the tempered glass bandwagon this
case is very similar to the defined see
which is also very well highly
critically acclaimed case so the
internal layout is basically defined see
but the outside is a bit different you
can see the front here we've got full
mesh instead of the the typical brushed
plastic so it's all open ventilation at
the front which is pretty nice and it
sort of has like this tessellated design
it's very subtle though you only really
noticed it from an angle you don't
really notice it too much
wifey sauce maybe can punch in a little
bit if you want to get a closer look at
the chassis but yeah I really like the
design it's kind of got this gloss
border around the mesh area which you
know gets finger prints on it and stuff
but if you keep it clean it it does look
pretty nice I really like this this sort
of the fractal design badge on the
bottom here I don't think fractals done
a case with with this sort of badge
before usually it's just kind of screen
printed or printed on onto the case
itself this kind of adds a touch of
class that makes it look a bit more
special than just an ordinary black box
so looks looks pretty swanky you've also
got front panel USB 3 on the top here
two blacked out ports I definitely like
how they're black and not blue kind of
just makes it a bit more stealthy power
button alright but power button feels
pretty solid actually I like it
I like that power button mic and
headphone jacks and a reset button which
is not too easy to press prevents
accidental resetting but has a nice nice
click to it as well then you've also got
plenty of ventilation at the top here so
no Majah vent covers or anything like
that you do have a removable dust filter
that is magnetic comes on really really
easy comes on off really easy and some
flexible mounting strips you get
mounting points for either to 120 s or
two 140 s we will be installing a 240
millimeter AIO in here today most likely
at the top as far as the front I should
mention that you do get mounting support
for three 120 s or two 140 s and we'll
take a closer look at that as well
I believe the best way to get this dust
filter out is oh wait
well first off bottom dust filter which
is really nice because it pulls out from
the front which I very much prefer than
the back or even the side and it's full
length of the case so not only does it
cover the power supply at the back but
there's also a 120 millimeter fan mount
at the front of the case at the very
bottom on the floor of the chassis that
this dust filter will leave it out for
now and that the dust filter will also
support and cover and stuff but the
front panel pops off like so and from
here now you are tethered I should
mention that you are tethered the front
panel is tethered by the i/o cables so
you can see here that front panel is not
really going to go very far which is
kind of inconvenient but fortunately
fractals designed the the dust filter in
such a way that you can just pop it out
it looks like it just comes out like so
the the mesh part itself is filtered and
you can just you know spray that off or
whatever and have a clean looking case
in the end so very nice design we're
gonna go ahead and keep this guy back on
here
let's see there's a way to pop this back
in whatever we'll do that afterwards
it's totally fine totally fine all right
so then there's let's take a look at the
back side as well
pretty standard rear i/o I mean you've
got 120 millimeter fan at the back also
one at the front these are both GP 12
fans they're black notice that this is
pretty much a blacked out case unlike a
lot of other fractals chasse EES which
tend to have white accents including the
white fan blades and expansion slots but
we're getting a blacked-out vibe here
which I definitely like 7 expansion
slots 3 4 5 6 7 with a power supply
mount so this is a removable bracket so
you can actually install the power
supply from the rear of the case that's
simply because you actually get a full
power supply basement or a shroud that
covers the full length of the chassis
which is super nice but I think I think
on that note I'm kind of ready to start
building I don't know about you guys you
can see here first off that I've got a
pile of components just waiting to be
handled we definitely will be doing that
I'm going to be going over the
individual components as we use them
instead of going over all of them right
now but there's also a purpose to this
built I don't know if I mentioned this
yet publicly but I'm gonna be having a
good buddy of mine Chris who helped me
out with editing at CES and Computex
this year he's gonna be interning for me
in a pretty soon pretty soon so I'm
he'll need an editing system it's gonna
be a side editing system I'm still gonna
do the bulk of the editing at least for
now so he doesn't need anything super
crazy but we're gonna build him a nice a
nice editing workstation inside of the
mesh if I see seems like a worthy case
to fit all of this hardware so um with
that said why don't we go ahead and just
start building away let's see oh there
goes the front panel see very very easy
to remove as I mentioned so wifey sauce
you can actually get in on here once you
if the cameras all good on that end
which it looks like it is you can you
know come out from obscurity and say hi
there we go front panels back in
just pops in super easy actually and
then we've got these four thumb screws
on the cases side panel boom take it out
guys take that ready boom
top-down shots isn't that beautiful look
at that eye I can youtubes I can do the
youtubes
alright so wifey sauce is gonna be
moderating chat making sure that you
guys are all in your best behaviors and
she's also gonna be helping me doing
some simple stuff with the build she'll
be my my sous chef but in a PC building
sense so we're gonna just take this
tempered glass off it's a full it's a
full piece of tempered glass which is
really nice and it is tinted so uh you
know the LEDs inside if you do put some
in your system won't be blinding you
that got some nice some nice black
borders all around the edges so you
don't see the the more rougher parts of
of the chassis and there's also some
foam it looks like on either side foams
nice because it sort of reduces any
vibration that that might occur from
when the case is running or when the
system is fully running there's also
some foam inside of the case as well
around the border another thing that
sort of separates this from a lot of the
other fractal defined series cases is
that there's no sound dampening so bear
that in mind might be a little bit more
noticeable acoustically than than some
of the other cases I'm sure it's still
not gonna be too bad alright so I guess
we should prep our motherboard first day
are we keeping all these on the table
right now we can we can take those down
actually if you want to put those
somewhere oh and because I'm super smart
and thought ahead I've already taken out
a lot of the components from their boxes
to save a bit of time here on stream so
I'm gonna try to figure out where this
should go
let's see right there oh it's good all
right so um I guess this should cue you
in on what kind of platform we're using
for today which is at X 299 we're going
with the core I said where's the
processor oh no do we already lose the
CPU yes that is one thing that I want to
leave in the box is because they can be
they can be fragile and stuff so we've
got a core i7 78 20x processor this is
an 8 core 16 thread part now I was gonna
go thread Reaper for this build actually
and totally pimp Chris out with with
AMD's latest high-end desktop platform
but I decided against it because the
only x3 99 motherboard right now which
is currently on a test bed behind YP is
still in use for testing so but rest
assured there will be a thread river
build coming very soon so we're gonna go
ahead and just snug this in I'm not
really gonna like show you guys how to
build a PC in the stream this is more
just just to hang out and chill but
there it is CPU installed also got some
some mammaries but why don't we do the
CPU cooler first s 24 Celsius Celsius s
24 also from the folks at fractal I did
do a review on this cooler if you wanna
check that out
fans have already been mounted to the
radiator courtesy of wifey sauce looks
like you mounted them on very well
properly even with the the cables facing
the right right way that's cool
we've got some that you want to do the
thermal paste alright
go with having the DAAD nothing dude do
it do it just like I showed you make me
proud make me proud right there show
them how it's done
look at that that is beautiful beautiful
nice classic grain of rice method or pea
method I like saying P me that because
cuz I'm saying P because I'm super
mature little boy and then we've got
some screws
you already have you're one step ahead
of me yes I know I just see this is why
I brought you along I'm a woman I'm a
lot more organized than you that's
that's pretty sexist wrong screws though
oh I have once again regain my need but
you know more about computer building
than I do self yeah you've definitely
learned you're a quick learner you've
caught on to a lot of things very
quickly so we're just gonna mount these
guys in this is a pretty standard you
know asa tech om CLC that do bright
alright let's go ahead and you gotta
turn down the brightness just the ISO
just crank the ISO down maybe 108
actually it's on this this camera
because I don't want you tripping on
this thing there's actually a stepping
ladder because YP sauce and I are really
short we're little people how about that
that looks better huh yeah yeah there's
still a little boom give you guys a bit
more of uh yeah that's that shot there
it's a little stripy but it'll do
it's nice let's strike peak let's try to
kill I see you that much oh yeah that
looks oh it's way better actually right
people liking liking the change zeebad
seabass somebody's even us what what
noises do zebras make do they sound like
horses do they may like horses do I've
never heard of zebra tuck what does the
zebra say question all right we're gonna
go ahead and mount this sucker straight
on
hmm all right I'll do one too because we
can do it at the same time that way
there's that way there's even amounts of
pressure on the CPU it's healthy this is
a happy CPU very happy you are double
fisting my wife everyone she double-fist
CPUs in her sleep she's just gotten so
good at the fish station process we can
put these other pigs away spirit LGA
1151 do you think what's up that's
enough that's what she said but yes I'm
gonna I'm gonna say that's pretty good
and then we can install our Rams our RAM
cycles which I think are still in the
box
oh yeah hey don't be so handsy let me do
it I like getting handsy that's one of
the reasons you married me all right
okay I'll take I'll take two all right
do you want all fours to give me all
four kidding me of course I went on for
was this look like a kibbeh accumulate
Knicks keep it like X building something
be kidding me just be Stanley gets you
do what we want on skylake X we get the
whole mobo on skylake X all right going
in
uno mas
all right and it seems that I have
somehow managed to color-coordinate
things that's had with the white accents
on the motherboard and our white dims
here with the tried NZ I should mention
this is tried NZ from g.skill very
recognizable modules that I'm sure you
guys already knew and 3200 speed we've
got a 32 gigabyte kit here so there 8
gig modules four of them that makes 32
and we can math that's that's been
confirmed so now we can just uh we can
actually mount this in the case let's
get that Mischa fast see over here yeah
mr. Fox watching already fractal Josh if
you're watching this screw you and I'm
just kidding I love you you are the best
you are the bestest tall friend that I
have even though you always look down on
me
literally I still love you I I admire I
admire my tall giant friends so what we
could do now is IO shield all right this
is gonna go in yeah it's kind of nice
and silvery is this uh this angle okay
well they don't even say that IO shield
going in out that's it's not the most
excited sup a highlight of a PC build
when the IO shield goes in OH
gets me every time man there's there's
nothing better than when that IO shield
goes in alright
and then uh looks like we've got we're
gonna need some accessories which if I
know my cases like I ought to
accessories are usually in the power
supply basement if there is one and sure
enough we've got a box right here in the
drive cage in the draft yeah open up
damn screws honey open on Veterans groom
so in case you guys are wondering while
she's getting those screws out reason
two cameras obviously both gh fours in
case you're wondering the one it's right
here and of course the one overhead the
one that's facing us head-on is actually
connected to an internal capture card of
the Blackmagic intensity Pro which is
what Paul and I have been using for
awesome hardware for a very long time
now so it's very reliable super high-end
and then this gh4 is actually connected
to an Elgato elgato capture HD external
card which I just bought yesterday so
this is the very first time I'm using it
so far it seems to be working pretty
well quality seems alright - so
everything's looking good so far knock
on all the wood we have to hopefully see
this through to the end of the stream
these look like motherboard screws these
might be motherboard screws
we definitely need standoff so standoffs
are not pre-installed with the exception
of the center one the little the little
nipple the little nipple standoff little
nipple that that helps you now the board
just a bit easier and we're gonna go
ahead and you can be the standoff holder
very important job you do very important
job we actually need the little adapter
here to screw in
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo come on stand off
get in there get in there
standoff is not going in hold on these
are all the right threads right
let's try a different one
come on McPherson wants to know how
heavy this case is compared to the food
of all exits
um it's uh it's quite a bit lighter I
would say simply because it's smaller
like the materials used granted the
evolved ATX has a lot of aluminum but
it's much bigger than than the mesh if I
see or the defined see even though it's
very sturdy like the the side panels
like the all the construction stuff is
pretty much a full steel so it feels
very very durable and there's not very
much flex in this case at all but it's a
little bit a little bit smaller than the
evolved ATX good question good questions
all around there are no stupid questions
class remember that I always hated when
my teachers would say that I always want
to be like yes there are stupid
questions especially when they make us
stay late why thank you
oh yeah yeah maybe you should start a
youtube channel or something
remember YouTube Chertoff I add
subscribe to you like oh yeah I'd have
to you're my wife I'd never hear the end
of it you know I'd subscribe to you
anyway
I'm sure okay some weird weird fun facts
behind the scenes stuff there's like
window washers we're we're high up you
see them no no I haven't yet but there
there are window washers that are coming
up right now we're on a pretty high
floor like you would die he jumped out
of the window on this floor so they are
gonna be coming up this window pretty
soon if we get a good shot of him I'll
turn the camera around so you guys can
wave wave hi at the window washers
hopefully not distract him and make them
fall why if you sauce will have a heart
attack if she's scared of heights
I'm scared for them what if
maybe you should maybe you should call
911 and try to save them there there's
the window washers here I mean I know
they're just doing their job but I think
they're gonna day oh I heard I heard
banging on the window right
I hope those can't those cables are I
hope they're like steel because they
look like they might just be like string
or something I think I think those are
shoelaces
brave men brave men braver than I that's
for sure
let's see we've got a couple more here I
believe this is our guy doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo
Oh Oh God does that mean if they're
close after the look you're gonna go
look after they look to see where they
are
all right you go look I have to
double-check really quick to make sure
that I am in fact installing this in the
right standoffs don't freak out yet guys
I know that there's a couple more
standoffs I have to do and just line it
up initially just to make sure okay
we're good we are good can you see them
no can't see them I know I think they're
starting from the bottom and then
working their way up okay
and voila pretty much don't the
standoffs and we can proceed to
installing in the motherboard I always
want to make sure that your stand
officer firmly in place and mountain
that mobo Oh looks like a cryo shield
actually popped out a little bit yeah
for the most part I mean LEDs I feel
like when it comes to ones that are
marketed towards PC enthusiasts and
stuff have gotten a lot brighter than
they used to be and you'll be able to
see them it just depends on how how
bright you like your LEDs really you
might you might need to add an
additional strip or something like that
if you know if the tint is too dim for
you that is an option but I don't know I
don't think it's like super tinted or
anything it should be good for most
people let's do it yeah let's do it
yeah fractal josh is we were in
correspondence with freckles Josh at the
moment and he is he is behind the scenes
pulling strings for you guys he's got
ideas he's a man full of full of good
ideas usually I've been with him long
enough to know that sometimes they're
very bad ideas but I go along with them
anyway because they're fun there is
there's plenty of room it's actually
designed for a is the top so you could
do either a dual 120 or dual 140 so 240
or 280 millimeter radiators will fit at
the top and you've also got room at the
front of the case for a 360 that's a
triple 120 or another 240 dual one I'm
sorry two hundred and eighty millimeter
a IO
so plenty of radiator options you could
definitely do some custom water cooling
in here and and have plenty of radiator
space for you know cooling your CPU and
your GPU really put fit a full loop in
here relatively easily for 89 bucks
quite a quite a good value from what I
can tell so far all right say cool if
you want to choose winner all right cool
all right so I've just gotten
confirmation from Frank and Josh that
this is now turning into a giveaway
stream so he is agreed to give one of
you lucky winners a new mesh if I see
case like the one I'm building in right
now so he said that we can it's pretty
much up to us how we won choose how we
want to choose the winner obviously it's
gonna be I'm thinking someone in chat
and this is gonna be a worldwide
worldwide giveaway I'm calling it right
now everyone is eligible unless you know
prohibited by local law and stuff like
that but let's see how about let's see
what time is it right now although for
according to that okay so maybe within
the first or within the next few minutes
here I'm gonna choose a winner
hmm yeah let's get creative here all
right you guys have to say something
nice about wifey sauce in chat okay then
you pick out one person who says like
the most I don't know something that
that that you like the most about what
they've said or you can just or can be
completely random it could just be like
wifey sauce rules and that's the person
you pick but but but to enter this
giveaway that's going on right now all
you have to do is write something about
wifey sauce in child or I know what you
know how you do awesome hard for every
Tuesday yeah whoever tweets me the best
I
idea of how to I know that requires them
to have a Twitter account another one
has a Twitter account you will just put
it in a check alright so just as long as
wifey sauce is somewhere in your in your
comment in chat then you are eligible to
win a new mesh if I see from fractal
design PI in cloud space bring off some
hardware you know stuff like that
whoever has the best idea no no wait no
we're talking about two different things
sorry
I like my idea better I already already
said the wifey sauce we'll just we'll
just go with the nicest wifey sauce
comment that will be picked by wifey
sauce yeah cuz you're you're the one
moderating chat so you have to alright
question about the case okay is there
any excess room for a small e ATX
motherboard or is it only ATX um it
looks like you could fit EI TX don't
quote me on that but it looks like
you've got at least maybe two additional
centimeters of board width to fit in
here granted though that will probably
block a little bit of the rubber
grommets going along the side so you
want to be cautious of that but again I
don't know exactly off the top of my
head so maybe just double check it's one
of those things where yeah it might be
maybe doable but it would be pretty snug
doable and advisable or two different
things typically so CPU fan oh this is
just a regular fan this is your regular
old fan will actually put this backwards
later that's why you just have to that's
why you just to click that's right you
just have to click is if you scroll up
watch scroll then it'll stop I know so
so just just pick one at random
you guys are monsters absolutely mad
pick one towards the end of the stream
towards the end you can make a breeze
right now
well okay don't do it right now well how
many people are watching right now Wow
we have 4600 people good lord
okay that's right that's cool well I've
we've often I've put the pressure on you
honey to pick a winner so at some point
how about how about how this how about
this
hi father-in-law I love you how about
this let's wait till we're about halfway
through the build before you pick
someone and you could if one of them
catches your eye if you manage to
actually read one of them completely
then you can save it see it for later so
what hey father-in-law Robby you are not
allowed to donate that here those are
not the rules my father-in-law is making
all you guys look like a bunch of chumps
he could have he could have bought he
could've bought a mess if I see for that
donation amount and then some oh my
goodness
this down for a sec all right go ahead
and switch the camera angle honey f1
boom boom o f1 also opens up Google
Chrome help I should have thought about
that before I assign that hotkey no damn
right they can't alright so the nice
thing about the about this cooler I'll
try to do this so that you guys can
still see what I'm doing as I mentioned
in my review is that there's actually a
PWM fan hub or fan pass-through or
controller I should say not a controller
just
a little piece on give us an advantage
yeah but that's like a given you know
that's that's that's that's all miss
that is true you get to pick I've given
you too much power
too much powerful one for one woman to
have good thing I married you and sealed
the deal you'll be getting you'll be
getting hit up with all kinds offers now
come on you there we go
flexible mounting strips are a thing of
beauty right honey that's okay you don't
need to I'm gonna put these in here for
now we can tighten it up later you know
we do have the oh I'm the best daughter
in the universe yeah what a crappy poo
you know we should do you know we should
do you should install the power supply
let's do that whores
because I'll tell you I
because the the a penny eps connector on
the motherboard is currently being a
little bit blocked by the the cooler
which is why I only put 10 screws in
there to hold it in place for now so
we're gonna get this guy in there so we
can wire up those parts of the
motherboard that would otherwise be
covered up and blocked so this guy will
do it face down we'll do the power
supply face down with the fan facing the
floor of the case because there is a
open ventilation and again we have that
dust filter at the very bottom of the
case power supply screws right here and
people are still going crazy with the
wipey sauce comments man that's crazy
they have to say something about my
favorite Ghibli character we can't no no
we we can't we can't we can't change the
rules yet because now because people
have already entered technically rules
are set in stone don't worry there will
be other giveaways where you're doing
great you've already got the whole chat
reeling everyone's going crazy I like
other bit like I like to sing all
people's like different techniques on
how to how to get spotted like using
like 30 emojis or uh you know yeah all
caps caps is a good one we have to thank
you for all the donations at the end
yeah of course
we do always appreciate any derp
nursing's
what does Josh wants so this power
supply should just go in like so
beautiful there's plenty of room to
spare there too and I've just been
abandoned by my own wife during a live
stream for another man
I'm not salty at all okay cool so now
we've got got some other stuff here
here's our 8 pin which I can route
through the top I love the all the
grommets in this case they're very well
thought out and there is one that's
plenty big in the top left corner of the
case if you're facing it this way which
is perfect for routing things like any
fan cables you might have or your 8 pin
EPS so let me go ahead and undo the a
i/o really quick what does he want
actually everyone is gonna be very very
happy
oh you're I should send a big THANK YOU
to fractal Josh what did he do this time
he's giving away a second no he is not
he said basically I have to think of
something that everyone has to tweet me
you have to send me a tweet okay and I
will whatever I think that person okay
so the first message if I see will go to
anyone who just says your name in chat
and then the second mesh if I see will
go to anyone who has tweeted you
something like this yes so it could be
like my favorite Ghibli character or Oh
how about how about you tweet me
something about your favorite Ghibli
movie
so what is it but what if they're not
into Ghibli what if they don't even know
what that is I wouldn't even know what
that is
knowledge about anime well you could eat
so then for those people who don't even
know what that is you could even just be
like Ghibli is my favoritest thing ever
wow you guys had a rough man if it was
me I just like close my eyes and spin in
a circle ten times in point whyphy sauce
has some criteria that you'll need to
meet so how about this why don't why
don't let's let's give chat a break you
you you pick you pick someone in chat
guys spam chat right now go crazy even
crazier I want to see this go Lightspeed
it's going fast already you were so
close person that we all that we will
not name you you're so close to winning
but you forgot to write in wifey sauces
name in your comment
alright so fire it up which one is dog
you know I must know so found one yo fun
map map okie dokie now we can proceed -
oh now my father's installing this okay
let him know that he's on speaker though
okay dad I just wanna let you know that
you're on speaker live hi Rodney safe to
hide everyone Rodney
oh I like that we already we already
said it the second way everyone's
already tweeting me you're too late
you're too late I'm trying Rodney I'm
trying real hard right now yeah you're
still alive just so you know everyone
can hear you
why thank you sir you sound fantastic my
husband is my dad's favorite child and
and and and my father-in-law is my
biggest fan
yeah hate to break a toe yes he's got a
portrait of my face like in his bedroom
tree we call them the Cal 2.0 is he
watching right now okay Jaime hi little
me we gotta get Kyle I'm gonna miss
dreams one of these days - Kyle's in a
weird sort of way yes sure you do use is
true you you just say his name wrong my
my tutor oh that's how my dad says so
throw everyone that's how you say it but
it sounds sounds accurate to me all
right
anyway you gotta go I gotta pick a
winner yes
no I did not I actually need am a
teacher okay bye what okay I won't
I'll keep it far from her static all
right bye Ronnie so while she picks a
winner go ahead and switch camera angles
honey scene two so it's hard to for you
guys to see right here I'll actually
rotate the case so you can see better
boom we're gonna be installing a an nvme
SSD and to drive we're gonna take the
chipset to cover or the m-dot to cover
which is sort of blending in with the
the heatsink on on the the chipset and
we're gonna remove the thermal pad strip
so that we can perhaps get some lower
thermals on our drive and drive that
we're gonna be using is the samsung 960
Pro and via me SSD which is a fantastic
fantastic super fast like one of the
fastest drives you can get right now in
this warm fact here I do need a little a
little stand off to install that are you
gonna read every single one there's
probably like 10,000 of them by now just
your it doesn't even matter you're not
gonna find like the perfect one just
just do any old random one
you're killing you're killing everyone
right now just so you know pick go who's
it gonna be I don't know you know I just
can I'll do my job you do your now Wow
attitude on this one all right right so
we're installing the SSD here wife your
sauce gets her crap together and we're
gonna just place the cover right back on
which goes like bloop this hey hey I
should also mention that it is a 512
gigabyte model I'm not sure if I
mentioned that but it's basically gonna
be the editing drive or the scratch disk
for for Chris it won't be the boot drive
we have another SSD that will be used as
a boot drive this is mainly just gonna
be the drive that he he puts all the raw
files on as he's editing them it's
always nice to sort of spread across
spread your workload when you're editing
across multiple drives instead of having
it all on one or two so you know
probably gonna have Adobe Premiere Pro
on the boot drive and then I'll have the
scratch disk on the 960 Pro and then
we're throwing into mechanical drive in
this as well just for for mass storage
and backup we can always add another
drive to the mix if we want to raid
later maybe do like a raid 0 raid 1
array just for redundancy but this
should be good for now
oh here's our first plastic peel of the
day oh that's a little baby one
well baby one but we'll do we'll save
the tempered glass for the end we'll go
out with a bang
next up let's do the two drives a what I
keep seeing a I think I think all those
Canadians rubbing off on me
damn Linus and Friends all right so we
can close this up yeah yeah sure
before storage let's do some cable
management let's fire up some cables so
I actually brought along some sleep
extensions because power supply I
believe has some ketchup and mustard on
it which I forgot to mention is the
integra and no yeah the integrity of 650
watt unit and we've got some extensions
for it however so with these nice white
sleeved extensions I believe these are
from fantex don't quote me I've lost the
retail packaging long ago but yeah they
look really nice no heat shrink heat
shrink is the worst wears
so let's flip let's go ahead and put him
in
hey it's firm making any headway over
there wifey yeah has a winner been
selected go ahead and switch camera
angles all right all right who do we got
who is our first mesh if I see winner of
today Oh hold on you are a tease madam
the royalties what please when do you
value my opinion
what kind of parallel universe is this
all right what is it
it's not really about me for this
I think this one is more about great
right as much as flattered as I am with
the other comment and if it was me
choosing I'd probably pick that guy all
right
but so the winner the first mesh if I
see KC fractal design is Daniel mark oh
sorry rest in peace headphone users good
lord
so the the comment that he won with was
a wifey sauce is a great beautiful
person waterfall of comments the power
is in your hands
with a little emoji with the tongue
sticking out congratulations work Daniel
oh oh he well he says it twice yeah I
thought he just like copy paste it twice
or whatever Daniel mark congratulations
I'm sure I'm sure there will be some
wait maybe you can hit a practical Josh
on Twitter at is it just at fractal Josh
I think so I want to double check I'm
pretty sure it is but hit him up let him
know who you want who you is and yeah
congratulations Josh fractal general
there will be another measure if I see
winner later on in the stream I should
start reviewing those as well you should
not make it about ghibli I already did
it's not fair I'm getting a lot of
tweets right now okay you you you do it
loud a tweet there we go got that
extension in there okay um now what are
we doing here we've got some front panel
connectors to deal with so let me just
show you guys how the backend looks of
the case camera angle please
to do okay
so here's sort of the back side of the
define see I'm sorry of the mesh if I
see I'm gonna zoom out a bit okay so um
you can see here we've got plenty of
space in the basement for for routing
cables as well as this nice fat channel
just to the left of them of the
motherboard and you can see it also
comes included with a couple velcro
straps fractal velcro straps which are
very handy and you've also got room for
three SSDs here or three two and a half
inch drives mechanical or SSDs on this
removable sort of bracket it's got a
single thumb screw and it just pops out
I just love how to list that is and how
there's only one screw for three drives
it's really nice additionally you've got
some tie-down points lovely lovely
amount of tie down points actually and
there's a three and a half inch drive
bay or drive cage at the bottom
underneath the power supply shroud as
well you get two trays for those those
mechanical drives and I believe this
this cage can actually be moved back
closer to the power supply if you want
to open up a bit more room in the front
for a three hundred and sixty millimeter
radiator so that's that's actually
really nice you could remove a page
altogether if you want to yeah oh yeah
how many people like have seen this
Ghibli film but it is by thought it's
actually my second favorite Ghibli movie
ok I'm going to retweet it after we pick
it but you ban fox handle is FX FX HD
Legion X T 13
and he says favorite Ghibli moment would
have to be the cleaning montage of the
Latin Quarter and up on poppy Hill
always gives me a giggle seriously one
of the best
besides reasons why I love Ghibli anime
so much is because you can change the
camera angle if you want oh that's true
I love all the food scenes in Ghibli
enemy by far the best did they do it the
best well that was one of the comments
that almost won the first measure if I
see was just a bunch of food emojis
there was nothing but like a thousand
food emojis and that person would have
won the first giveaway case but they did
not actually mention wifey sauces name
which was one of the requirements he's
gonna listen to the instructions
carefully guys read the manual
all the time alright
you can switch camera angles again
because we all know how riveting SSD
installation can be oh man I'm getting a
stiffy just thinking about it alright
get in there
dunno alright and then once your SSD or
SSDs are installed on the bracket
there's two little latches on the right
and that one thumb screw goes back in
beautiful solid solido all right you
know we could do is maybe add a couple a
couple cables to the mix here from our
power supply including see what are we
gonna need here we're gonna need at
least one SATA cable for our SSD and
depending on how this reaches we're
probably gonna need two because we also
have a mechanical drive going into the
cage and no no you're fine for now
you're good you're good but their tables
that I should have admittedly put in
first that's okay go over the part again
hold on one moment oh oh and woman so
the parts list yes for all of our parts
for the build but so far we've got a
core i7 78 20x that's a styling X
processor eight core 16 thread part
since my dad called you on stream who
says he has now eight followers hottest
YouTube yeah how did they find him how
the heck do you guys you guys are creepy
like there's no like he didn't even like
shout out his YouTube channel or
anything he's still managed to find him
dad is crazy you guys are a little scary
aren't you cuz you're a wee bit scary
you know in hindsight I should have
connected these cables the power supply
before inserting the whole unit but you
know what I'm good
we're totally good there's only one more
that we need to get in there actually no
well the PCIe one of the PC I use is
already fixed to the unit so you really
only needed those to save the cables and
we're good so let's uh let's string this
guy up first do our lovely SSD here and
we've got SATA data to the rescue just
go to the flat I like the flat flat on
flats particularly for for these SSDs
that are mounted in such a way boom and
we can put this through I would imagine
right about here just where we need that
to go we'll worry about that on the
other side later for now we can just
sort of tuck tuck this away now because
this is a stream and I don't want to
take all of your guys's time I'm gonna
just I'm gonna be efficient with my
cable management let's put it that way I
will be very efficient we can shove this
guy in here for now
so you need me to help you should I
actually pretend like I'm interested in
Bolinas this no your your your your lack
of interest is quintessential wiper
sauce
anything else would be disingenuous
alright just in genuine so um Nick right
now we can also do our our hard drive
one of our hard drives here wifey you
know you can do is you can mount the
hard drive make sure that it goes that
away holes you know how to do it and
then we've got some front panel
connectors a more Canadians Canadians
everywhere okay let's do yep those are
the ones
could you go switch camera angles for a
moment just a moment okay it's just so
nice having like all this extra space in
the noose in the new place whereas
before it would it was really tough to
do live streams like this with multiple
cameras different angles yes we woman
woman that's right this is a woman's
whip this is a ladies tune all right
yeah usb3 here
thank you Asus for making this USB 3
header a right angle connector I do
appreciate it and the way that these
grommets on the metruff I see are
positioned how it's sort of indented and
angled makes it really easy for these
right angles connections whether it be
for your USB 3 header
or for your SATA cables you have to
shake the data hey dude all right that's
gonna go in just like that Dan the
system is looking pretty sexy already we
haven't even put the GPU in brosefs
massive massive and we do have an HD
audio front panel connector that I am
NOT going to use because front panel
audio is the devil I don't like using it
I think it's bad I don't fault other
people for using it but it's just a
personal choice I abstained in the HD
audio connectives whoo all right
wow I didn't know that you could install
the hard drive with your cell phone I
already did it
jerk I'm just giving you a hard time
it's fun you did looks like you did a
fantastic job I did do a fantastic job
you always do
fun fact wifey sauce and I celebrated
our well we didn't celebrate it but we
had it's been a crazy week we had our
two year wedding anniversary
just yesterday no just two days ago so
Monday Monday Monday is when we
celebrated like I said it's been a long
week that's what I said Monday two years
of marriage seven years together
ah that's that's what drugs are for kids
nope you're stuck with me now us but
we'll celebrate eventually well we'll
find some time after after the thread
Ripper launch like thread Ripper launch
first and then and then everlasting tree
like red river launch everlasting true
love and you know we have to get our
priorities straight
I'm saying it's freaking thread Ripper
let's be real here people top-down shot
please again front panel connectors um
you know what I think we're good you
know we can install that in just a sec I
have to do this great of course of
course
any other questions about this case ask
away LED power switch boom
reset bring sense
boo boo boo boom you know would be cool
for the future is if we could get a
floating cam so that you know when Chris
starts interning for us and we do live
streams like this again you can just be
on the move like with the camera mobile
and mobile setup that would be cool
I'm sure you'd be down that oh yeah well
force him to be down with it
awesome against two-speed do do
well we're speeding through this thing
all right
then front panels be installed you and
wifey sauce appears to have mounted the
hard drive very nicely okay inside the
tray just slide down like that and let's
say it's connected got another seat of
cable right here
no mr. Sato go Kyle I am your friend
okay
see the power turtles in a half-shell
say to power and then we've got oh you
little dude okay my little in your line
and this can go just like this maybe
Mary oh my god forty five subscribers
now forty five writers freaking crazy
guys are nuts
you you you guys be kind to my
father-in-law
he's done nothing he's done nothing to
you
I'm very protective of my friends and
family most of you guys are awesome but
there's there's always like that 1% of
d-bags that ruin it for the rest of us
I'm sure you guys will be very
respectful very respectful no worries
have nothing to worry about I'm sure and
one all died almost positive shell hi
Rachel hello Joe my writing standard
doing her job we should have Riley and
Skylar babies on this stream woman this
is a no babies own babies I don't
imagine a toddler trying to build a
computer that be amazing that would be a
very slow live stream I'm sure some
people would tune in though baby live
stream so if like you know like we had
like a team of like a teat like you and
me versus a team of babies and see us go
because that's pretty much our skill
level is baby we're at the baby skill
level baby rank biatch all right
come on you come on you Santa come on
you dirty save a cable done good there
you go there you go
beautiful beautiful we've got let's see
we got a fan cable that needs tending to
don't we couple here so there's one over
there uh-huh
channel fan ha ha ha
oh this person has a bigger sin icon
I love invader zim Raiders neum and
weevils am okay next up we can do dang
dude we're like already cruisin
we are already cruisin so much so again
you guys are just tuning in this is a
skylake X X 299 build featuring a core
i7 7820 k8 core 16 thread processor from
the folks over at Intel the motherboard
is an Asus primed X 299 deluxe which is
a very nice sexy high-end board with
features up the wazoo why thank you very
much so our good friend and pal cell
processing is moderating chat like he
does for awesome hardware sells the best
he is the most awesome
I love so I love you so much
ok we might need a fan hold on oh you
know what so there is one additional fan
header at the top of the motherboard
that is currently inaccessible because I
should have done that before I should
have plugged in the rear fan into the
top you your beautiful face fragile
beautiful soulless awful face ok so it
looks like there's a pump header down
there I'll be right back I'm gonna get a
fan splitter or a fan I'm sorry a fan
extension cable which
should be somewhere near oh yeah oh yeah
oh yeah oh yeah
this is gonna do it this will do it bros
y'all ready for this doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo
that looks like a fan header to me
uh-huh oh you know what even better
there's one even closer to the area
there this goes in like so II and the
fun part now you know the fun part is
honey what sorry the graphics card wait
I gotta undo these first just tell you
I'm gonna do it that's all right you
tell how it is you do what you want all
right so we've got pretty standard
expansion slot removal here thumb screws
remove the brackets first and thingy
wifey sauce go ahead and install that
guy for a sec address it that's right
yeah this is the right way yeah just
make sure that it's going in so that's
right oh yeah you're good just make sure
that you line up the the slot oh yeah
yeah and push it firmly in place and
then you can actually do the thumb
screws if you like no no just leave it
like that because it's already in frame
for the camera yeah okay so how do we
know if that's the right one can you go
back and view all over no cuz I tried
scrolling up and it wouldn't let me a
certain point it cuts it off okay you
handle it you tend to that let me do
what I do

the GTX 1084 the win from the folks at
EVGA a beautiful card a beautiful card
in every way that is an EPS cable this
looks to be I love everyone maybe wants
the best out at a time
damn Bros this case system is looking

your big mouth keep someone running
shut rap man
we could use some you know you can do
honey could you give me some velcro
straps some velcro straps maybe just
like two of them two should be good uh
yeah those are fine those are fine by
the way did you already pick the second
mesh to fight winner yes he did yeah
you're right you're right mr. Fox was uh

most awesome
he did answer stuff my heart doesn't

cannot sing mmm
you guys want to hear joke no wife you
saw singing sick burn bro wow wow wow it
looks so good it looks so good you're
getting yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
beautiful okay so at this point this is
just a cable management game now so like
I said I'm gonna be very efficient here
because this is just a stream not we're
not going for bonus points here or
anything but even even if you're in a
rush I mean it still managed to make the
cabling pretty tidy back here especially
with all this room in the power supply
basement yes pretty tidy what is this
hey you know pay attention to that pay
attention to all the details you know
what no no comments no comments from the
peanut gallery don't you have a a job to
be doing oh wait yes I am doing my god I
told you to do this oh she hurts me you
saw it here we got evidence I thought
you needed a second one just thinking
yeah just in case you know we could use
some zip ties which come included with
the define or keep calling the plank the
mesh if I see make a minus EE and cable
management again it's just super super
easy get in here who is the real Daniel
mark screenshot that boom and send it to
Josh that's okay as long as you can
oh wait you know what wait go back go
back to his go back to his comment
wherever he is find him my little gurus
oh yeah go again you can't write you
can't what about his name what wait what
about this go to that was that give you
an option
go to channel boom no just copy that
link come to that exact link
jeschill just don't know what to do once
you give him the link we see work okay
josh is a smart man
sometimes josh is a trustworthy man very
sometimes
all right
how long do you think it'll be until
freckle Josh just makes himself at home
here and like we just rolled to work one
day and he's just sitting on our couch
but then at the new studio yeah you're
right
you know what speaking of which you know
how we were talking earlier guys that
wifey sauce and I our two year wedding
anniversary just passed but we haven't
had a chance to celebrate just yet
you can cut here well frankly Josh and
and the two of us and maybe some other
special people will actually be doing a
pretty epic yacht cruise I will be a
will be doing a special a special
activity on the yacht that I think you
guys are really gonna like I'm giving
away too much information breath but it
also did a cool way to you know
celebrate celebrate our anniversary and
stuff drink you some light on the yacht
supercool brizz super cool champagne
stew being all fancy I don't even know
what to do on a yacht right well I know
you're gonna be doing on the yacht well
you already know but I'm gonna be
chilling all the yummy he'll be chilling
like a villain
okey dokey dams guy's dams Ghoulies
alright wifey sauce can you go ahead and
man the camera really quick sure because
our build ladies and gentlemen is totes
complete
ba-ba-boom here's a look at the finish
system and look at that back side panel
goes on no problem go ahead and zoom in
on this puppy go ahead and zoom in on
her
let's see that let's see that beautiful
new bailed yeah
Oh like that that is awesome I should
also mention something here this is this
plate is removable at the front of the
shroud you can remove that if you want
to make room for three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator at the front we've
got that 120 at the front it's gonna
give us a nice airflow over our graphics
card here ya went in very very smoothly
there is plenty of clearance for
everything ram included you're not gonna
run into any air of interference in that
regard and obviously we have pretty much
full length support for graphics cards
and power supplies for that for that
matter
bear in mind that if you are gonna be
installing a 360 at the front they're
gonna need to move your your drive cage
over towards the back a little bit and
so it would benefit you to have a
shorter power supply just so you can fit
all your cables and stuff nicely nice
doesn't look really good it's kind of me
kind of I just literally just found some
parts lying around that I knew would do
Chris and good as an editing machine and
and tried to match it so that it's
mostly black and white and looks great
absolutely nice so why don't we go ahead
and you know we should do yeah you can
go ahead and zoom out wait wait there's
one thing you need to zoom in on
all right let's do the drop down oh yeah
top down you know me up woman yeah as
promised ladies and gentlemen we're
gonna do I think perhaps my first ever
live plastic peeling all right you guys
ready for this um you know we should do
first don't mess up don't mess that we
should do first I need a new little
stand cuz I want to put it on here it's
all messy and stuff all right well it's
kind of weird good it'll have a stance
right okay fine I'll hold it or you hold
it yeah
all right we're gonna do the little one
first the handle with care' sticker
unless it's just on it's part of that
just know it just oh yes part of it all
right here we go you ready guys
oh you know we need it we need it hold
on hold on okay
putting so much thought into this
there's a big deal right here we go
quiet are you an old guy old guy ah it
was too quick I was too aggressive I was
too aggressive oh all right you get that
out why can't I can't sit it on here I
was just gonna get a bunch of things
nice you're right that was a test you
passed
good job you get you get to keep your
job all right so we can worry about that
part later
yes allies saw this okay wife your sauce
wants to put the glass panel back on or
of it wait but before you do it before
you do that before you do that hold on
because you can put that down for a sec
because I'm gonna actually um boot the
system and make sure that we have that
we have everything in order that it
works that it actually powers on and
stuff AC power cable which
here yeah don't put it there all right
done here come here you go thank you
okay yeah
all right here we go is gentleman ready
three two one
Oh power supply switch ha ha ha ha ha
there we go all right let's try this
again 3 that's scared me 2 1 ok ok I
just I just miss cliff dude the first
time it's all good
looks like fans are spinning we got all
fans spinning we got four fans in here
currently
oh you maybe turn off some light so they
can see the LEDs or it would be too dark
in here uh I guess I guess there are
LEDs in here aren't there a little bit
yeah go ahead and close close off the
closed off the blinds well yeah maybe
not so much but that's okay we can we
can maybe all right no worries we'll uh
we'll tweet you guys some pictures in
low light of so you can kind of get the
the full effect of the LEDs that are on
the motherboard which look really nice
and of course there's some LED action on
the graphics card but um ladies and
gentlemen we have here our first ever
mesh if IC system a high-end high-end
editing workstation which can also
probably kick some ass in games if if we
ever need it to so so Chris if you're
watching this is your new system buddy
hope you enjoy it
yeah but holy crap that was that was
awesome uh I mean I don't know how long
was this how long are we have we've been
streaming so far I mean it's probably
only been an hour or two my point is
that we we were able to even while doing
a stream and sort of conducting this
this this production we were able to
build in a full system in the metruff i
see pretty quickly and relatively easily
I don't think I ran into any snags
really so pretty much the same
experience at least for me as building
in the define see so measure if I see
Frank will design you've you've done it
yet again awesome job on the case and
guys if you want to find out more you
can go ahead and visit the link that's
in the video description yes let's do
that
go ahead do you have it all listed and
stuff all you guys who donated let's go
ahead in why are they saying CPU power I
don't know oh wait
CPU power did we forget CPU hold on hold
on a sec
No
I think that's good
where is this actually going yeah you
know CPU is good why are they saying CPU
power so we've been live for an hour and
23 minutes according to self 23 minutes
an hour and 23 minutes hour and 20 hour
and a half not bad
no no guys looks pretty good to me CPU
seems to be getting power CPU power what
why are they I don't know maybe there's
truly you know what do you guys mean by
CPU power the CPU power cable no the CPU
power cables in what do you guys mean
I don't know what you get for smoking or
maybe maybe I'm just missing something
entirely this the 8 pin CPU plug is
powered or it's plugged in from the
power supply looks good to me
are they trolling you oh you guys are a
bunch of trolls I hate all of you you're
all just salty cuz you didn't win at
mesh if I see dicks
no I'm just kidding that was a good
troll but I hate you all the system is
is looking good you know what you got me
all freaked out now I hate you guys you
got me all freaked out so now I'm going
to connect it to a monitor just to
ensure and prove to everyone that if
this is actually a functioning system
with the CPU power ok hold on I'm
getting it getting a damn display cable
in here all right got a monitor come on
there's the connection to the panel
that's behind y'see sauce right now wait
I'm gonna reboot the system resetting
the system
come on come on maybe they should turn
the monitor on
let's go buddy come on hey
Hey what are you doing
it's totally fine it's totally fine it's
all working give me one second I've been
having issues with this monitor from
time to time it's actually giving me
issues with Red River not because of the
CPU necessarily powers on
come on
why isn't working
I swear this frickin monitor he's given
the issues
it's got hella issues brow
come on you know we should try instead
what about another monitor it's not the
GPU power you freaks hold on give me a
moment
give me a moment gosh see everything was
going way too smoothly for it to be a
proper livestream the universe was like
No
he almost got away he almost got away
clean not on our watch we are the stream
police ensuring that at least one bad
thing happens in every live stream
alright now we can go select let's do up
Oh DisplayPort to select haha
look look everyone this is probably not
the most practical way to show you but I
will
can you auditor on that screen to make
sure that it's visible your opponent
wait right now you see it look look
yay we have a post stream you can
actually see it what what yeah peek it
out a little bit more okay
yay all right I feel better now now that
I prove that I built a working system
yes I have a tech channel and I know how
to build a computer that was essential
that I proved myself
let's select here go up to DisplayPort
okay hold on up select display port -
all right y'all all right Joe
weight-wise and now okay guys that is
pretty much gonna do it
shout out yes okay hold up for you pull
it up so we were basically just using
the mount the same monitor that we were
using for monitoring the stream and and
now that's not appearing we're firing
blind here we're firing blindly this see
this is why we need new monitors we're
actually getting what don't say anything
yet we're getting we're getting some new
hardware there we go hey hey totally
fake
you can totally tell that you know there
was no reflection in the monitor when
there should have been all these
conspiracy theories now but we have some
donations to read off nice try guys nice
try
all right donation these are the ones
that sell sent me I don't know if that's
all of them but those are the ones we
have okay cool we only have a couple
here
David Lee thank you very much for your
10 Canadians hi betwen I'm thinking of
getting a new case on top of a new
motherboard CPU and RAM this fall
because I want to install a hybrid kit
for my GTX 1080i is there any
recommendation for a case that's a
hundred and thirty dollars and below why
yes actually the mesh if I see from
Frankland's I'm is an excellent option
if you're looking for a relatively
affordable case with quite a few
features that 89 bucks yeah 89 bucks sub
$100 you're still getting tempered glass
full ATX GPU and power supply support
and a very good ventilation from what I
can tell obviously I would need to do
some more testing to see what like
thermals are like under load and things
like that but overall get plenty of
radiator support as well which is super
nice again up to a 240 at the top 360 at
the front oh yeah you can put that sexy
tempered glass on that'd be a good good
time to do that so um yeah good luck
though David next we've got Rodney for
$100 donation not even any comment
attached to it just here you go son and
daughter
well son-in-law and daughter if it was
your son and daughter I'd be really
creepy I just old me but that's fine if
you only take a second anyway next we've
got sad assassin are you so sad assassin
did you assassinate someone you weren't
supposed to woo you guys are amazing
thank you very much I'm feeling I'm
feeling so hard right now YV sauce is
bailing so hard I'm trying not to touch
the glass we can always rent the glass
down later
stelios deal off 10 euros random symbols
because I don't really know what to say
