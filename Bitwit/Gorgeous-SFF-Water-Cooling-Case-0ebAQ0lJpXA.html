to you by fractal design MSI and cable
mod check out the links in the
description below or check out the links
in the description below it's your
choice
we're now rolling up to the in win booth
I always love checking out anyone
they've always got some cool stuff let's
check it out
alright so many of you guys are already
a fan of the Inman 303 it was a very
successful case that was sort of
unexpected from a company like inland
where it just it just had a lot of cool
features going forward had a really
unique look
well they've actually taken that same
sort of idea that concept of a case and
shrunk it down like a lot of case
vendors do but actually this is really
really really cool this is the Inland
301 and it's kind of like the smaller
brother of the 303 you can see it still
got sort of the same look same case feet
same sort of a matte finish on the front
with the LEDs at the front unfortunately
the LEDs right now or are red and I
think that's just how they're going to
stay of course you don't have to connect
that whether it's a molex or SATA plug
if you didn't want to if you want to
just leave the LEDs off however you also
do get some tempered glass on the side I
do like the the latch system that
they're sticking with that I think that
is a huge plus thank you very much Paul
I'll just get rolled in if you look at
the internals here you can see this is
definitely a case that's built for water
cooling despite being a mini ITX form
factor so you've got a 240 millimeter
radiator at the front there looks like
they've already got a pumping reservoir
attached to the front with a special
bracket that is of course not included
you also get to depending on how much
hardware you want to put at the front
you can get full hardware support for a
GPU you've got kind of an interesting
layout in terms of storage and power
supply power supply and storage are both
at the top of the case you can see
they've actually included a shroud there
so even if you have a hideous sticker on
your unit you're totally safe from it
looking horrendous storage is also right
there three and a half or two and a half
inch right up there at the front and
then at the bottom you've got some fans
you've got air flow actually coming from
the bottom of your chassis other those
are to 120s and you've got another 120
at the back the fans that you're seeing
here are in wins own line of RGB chassis
fans so these are not included with the
case but again the main appeal here the
main draw is to have something that you
can kind of carry around tote with you
if you need to or if you just don't want
to take up too much desk space while
still having quite a bit of water
clothing potential
they're still messing around with the
MSRP for this I told them maybe 70 to 80
dollars I mean you are getting tempered
glass you're getting some decent water
cooling support and it just looks pretty
badass again
the the thing that made the inland 303
so popular is that it was just a really
aggressive price point you know eighty
nine dollars or so depending on where
you got it so they can't go too much
further than that
with the 301 but it's looking pretty
promising so far let me know what you
guys think in the comments below
speaking of user feedback this is an in
win 303 but it's kind of an OEM design
you can see on the front it looks
completely different than what we've
seen on the traditional retail version
so they've kind of got like a gloss
finish here there's also no branding
there's like there's zero branding
instead of having the England logo right
there it's just completely blank and
when was just telling me that they were
thinking about having users designer or
H in their own logo make it kind of like
an OEM feel to customize it even further
internals here all the same the only
difference here is that front panel let
me know what you guys think do you guys
like the gloss finish with the
minimalistic branding or do you prefer
the traditional Inman 3:03 look I kind
of told them like a hybrid would be good
like give users the matte finish without
the branding and I think everyone will
be happy but that could be just mean let
me know in the comments what you think
and this is especially needing your user
feedback right here this is also an in
win 303 however they've messed around
with some of the internal layouts as
well first off RGB LEDs I think that was
just a long time coming I think as soon
as I saw this case the first thing I
thought was why can I only have like red
or white LEDs or red or red or blue LEDs
that just doesn't make sense so RGB I
think is definitely something that many
of you guys will be like kind of roll
your eyes like of course it's now our GB
but at the same time it is kind of nice
having that option to select whatever
color you want based on the the scheme
that you're going for also the other
difference you'll see here it's kind of
hard to tell let me go ahead and take
this panel off doo-doo-doo-doo these
tempered glass panels I always get
nervous at these conventions but the
other big difference here is that you'll
see that the GPU is now mounted
vertically so it does cover up some of
the motherboard however it does also
show off more of your GPU shroud so I
don't know I think this kind of ties in
really nicely with the the fact that the
fans or the radiator support is mounted
in that sort of vertical orientation as
you see
there it kind of just goes hand in hand
in my opinion but some of you guys might
feel differently so let me know in the
comments what you think do you like it
like this vertical orientation or more
the traditional original kind of a
horizontal layout there let's go ahead
and see the last case that were checking
out here at the booth and we'll wrap
this up alright guys this is the last
case we're checking out here today and
when this is the Tao 2.0 apparently
there was a Tao 1.0 that I never even
heard about so when I saw this I was
like ooh brand-new case it's kind of
more of a refined case they made some
updates to since the last one so
speaking of which the first one is this
LED touch sensor which Paul can so
eloquently demonstrate so I guess yeah
that's that's totally functional I'm not
sure if this is just like a prototype
because it's not really working the
power button works because clearly Paul
just turned everything off but
apparently that the finger sensor you
can slide it up and down and change the
LED brightness on there I believe those
are fixed LEDs in terms of color I don't
believe you can change the actual color
of them the other addition that they've
made here or the revision is that
they've actually increased the thickness
of the tempered glass from three to five
millimeters so it does look pretty beefy
I will say it does look nice it kind of
looks like this polygon old texturized
things DVI I don't know it kind of looks
like dark crystal status you know from
from the future the other last additions
they've made here is that they've
included dual three 360 rad support so
you get 360 at the front and the top for
pretty much any kind of water cooling
customization you might want to throw in
there I'm over all a pretty insane
looking rig I will say the one the one
shortcoming that I would say is and this
is kind of just you know constructive
criticism hopefully to in win is stop
making your power supply's proprietary
because I what why cuz that kind of
limits the functionality you can't
actually pop this power supply into a
different case should you decide to do
so in the future however it is a pretty
pretty nice power supply it is 80 plus
certified I believe well uh Platinum
maybe maybe even died sanding I'm not
sure don't quote me I'm not that it is
1065 watts I forget the exact model name
of course inland is also known for their
really high quality power supplies I
would just hope to see less proprietary
versions of that in the future but that
is going to do it for now guys this has
been in Wynn at CES 2017 I'm with Paul
hmm thank you guys so much for watching
stay tuned for more coverage coming
really soon thinking to my sponsors MSI
fractal design
and cable wad go ahead and check out
their stuff in the don't stop it stop it
Paul do not subscribe to Paul's channel
in fact you should unsubscribe if you
are already here to subscribe
nope you go away you stay out of my
videos you stay out all right guys I
gotta go
screw you Paul</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
