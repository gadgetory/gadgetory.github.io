channel today is very exciting indeed
because AMD has just revealed their new
lineup of rising 5 CPUs oh my god
so for those of you who are unfamiliar
this the rising 5 stack falls just
behind the rising 7 family in terms of
performance however we're going to see a
lot more aggressive pricing with these
particular options than rising 7 which
makes it a very attractive deal for
budget gamers or content creators alike
we've got four new SKUs to discuss today
in relative detail
AMD didn't give everything away but we
certainly know a lot more than we just
did yesterday so we're going to be
talking about those four of these parts
two of which are 6 core 12 thread the
other two SKUs are four core eight
threads so definitely a nice range of
options and capabilities between these
various CPUs in the r5 lineup we're also
going to be seeing all of these SKUs
launched on April 11th so mark your
calendars get your wallets ready this is
going to be fantastic and this is really
just right around the corner if you're
watching this video around the time of
upload I also want to mention that all
four of these SKUs are going to be
featuring unlocked multipliers so all
you overclockers out there can go ahead
and tweak and tune your various clock
speeds higher than what they're rated
for out of the box and then lastly I
wanted to mention that sense mi is also
going to apply to all of these parts as
well since mi again is just AMD sort of
umbrella of technologies to really
improve the user experience and the
performance of the chip itself this
includes things like precision boosts
XFR and the like so on that note let's
go ahead and talk about our first chip
here which is the flagship six core 12
thread part the 1600 X the r5 1600 X
which is MSRP that's now word for just
249 dollars and that's very exciting
actually puts it very competitively
priced with the core i5 7600 K however
it's got two more cores and four more
threads which is super awesome we've
also got a base clock of 3.6 gigahertz
with a boost of 4 gigahertz and I
believe that's going to be single core
don't quote me on that that was one
detail that AMD left out but I think
that 4 gigahertz boost is going to apply
to a single core or a single threaded
workload you're probably gonna have to
manually overclock it in order to apply
that frequency to all cores just how we
saw with rival 7 as far as XFR goes AMD
was also leaving us in the dark as far
as what kind
boost we could expect from xfr if it was
just going to be another 100 megahertz
overclock similar to what we saw in the
1800 X for example or if it's going to
be something completely different we
don't know at this point but XFR will in
fact be there we've also got a 95 watt
TDP on this particular chip this is the
only part in risin 5 that is rated at 95
Watts TDP all the other skis are 65
watts so bear that in mind this is also
the only skew and r5 that is not going
to come bundled with any cooler so it's
just going to be the part
Alucard I'm rhyming now and I would
assume that's because the 1600 X is
going to appeal mostly to the enthusiast
crowd and they're probably going to want
to bring in their own CPU coolers anyway
but nonetheless a very exciting SKU that
I can't wait to get on the test bench
and just see how she flies next up we've
got the 1600 which is the other six core
12 thread part in the risin 5 line up
this is going to be retailing for two
hundred and nineteen dollars very
attractive price points here with 3.2
gigahertz out of the box base with a
boost up to 3.6 gigahertz again we don't
know how X bar is going to affect this
particular part the 1600 will shape with
a 65 watt TDP and will also come bundled
with the Wraith spire cooler very
similar to the one that comes packaged
with the r7 1700 however all of the
spire coolers that come bundled with our
five parts will not feature any LED
blinks so to speak so that glowing ring
around the fan will just simply not be
there everything else is this thing and
then we've got two more SKUs to talk
about here which are going to be our
four core eight thread parts also very
exciting especially given the price
points our first one here is the 1500 X
which is going to be MSRP again for one
hundred and eighty-nine dollars very
competitively priced here four cores
eight threads a boost clock of 3.5
gigahertz boosting to 3.7 and for this
particular CPU AMD actually did give us
a clue as to how X bar was going to
function with this particular part so
we're actually going to be seeing an X
afar boost up to 3.9 gigahertz
potentially which is a 200 megahertz
boost or twice as much as the 100
megahertz boost that we saw in the 1800
X for example but 3.9 gigahertz
potentially right out of the box it's
very exciting
like the 1600 the 1500 X is a 65 watt
TDP chip that is going to be bundled
with the Wraiths fire cooler
non LED version now finally we have our
entry-level 4 core 8 thread part with
r5 lineup and this is the 1400 at just
$169 MSRP super-attractive price point
here a base clock of 3.2 boosting 3.4
the 65 watt TDP chip will come included
with the race stealth cooler which is a
slightly smaller version of the race
spire at least from the looks of the
pictures and that's pretty much it those
are all the specs that I have for these
four new parts within the risin 5 family
very exciting stuff I think the risin 5
stack is going to create more of a
disrupt honestly in the desktop CPU
market than than risin 7 did of course I
want to speak too soon on these things
until we have the parts in our test beds
and whatnot but very exciting
nonetheless you guys let me know if you
feel the same way in the comments and
also which one of these skis so far
stands out to you the most and which one
would you really have your eye on based
on performance and pricing and things
like that so that's going to do it for
now guys thank you so much for tuning in
I know this was a short brief and sort
of a high-level video on risin 5 but
it's a huge announcement that I want to
share with you guys so hopefully you
enjoyed it feel free to toss me a like
on the video if you did and I'll be
seeing you guys very soon have a goin
guys I'll see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
