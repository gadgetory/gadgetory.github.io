going on guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well today
I am super excited because I'm actually
assembling my own professional
workstation system for 4k video editing
that's that's gonna be used here at the
studio as of now I'm actually using our
HTPC grant it's a very high-end HTPC to
do all of our editing but it's just not
the most ideal solution we've been using
Google chromecast at home and it kind of
sucks so finally I'll have the dedicated
editing system so I'm really excited
about that let's just dive into the
hardware we've got a 16 core 32 thread
guys Intel Core I 979 60 X CPU that
we're gonna be using it for today part
of the skylake X platform of course this
thing is an absolute beast 44 PCIe lanes
of course thread Ripper has more I know
all the comments are gonna be filled
with that but this is gonna be
absolutely crazy I'm very excited to be
building with this we use the 78 20x the
core i7 part for Chris the interns build
a couple weeks back and that thing has
been kicking ass this is literally
doubling the number of cores and threads
so I'm super stoked to be using it today
we've also got the X 299 or s gaming 9
motherboard from gigabyte also a beast
of a product tons of RGB LED elements
that can be disabled very important and
there's also just a ton of connectivity
most importantly 3m2 slots that are
supporting nvme drives which we're going
to be filling up two of those today so
super stoked to be using that
additionally we have memory
memory 32gig of tritons ERG be ddr4 at
3200 speed this kid is absolutely
fantastic it's just as fast as it is
colorful and yeah it's right the box is
empty or the help dims go well whatever
they're floating around somewhere in the
office we'll have to track them down
before we start building but we've also
got a Radeon rx Vega 64 this is the ROG
Strix variant from good ol Asus this
thing is an absolute monster the
overclocking is a bit weird right now
because they're having some AMD is
having some issues with the V BIOS it's
not a CSS fault but within a week or so
they should have it up and running just
fine and we're gonna be able to get some
really nice overclocks with this guy and
hopefully there are thermals than we do
with the reference model that's for sure
for storage we've got two nvme drives
that we're using today only one of which
is in a box the 960 Evo from Samsung
this is super fast we're gonna be using
it as our boot drive it's a 250 gig
capacity and then we've also got a one
terabyte Rd 400 from Toshiba OCZ this
thing is super fast we've been using it
a lot in just various builds in the past
I think it's finally landing a permanent
home in today's system so that's also
cool and then Aero cool stuff actually
Aero cool is the primary sponsor for
today's build so thank you Eric wolf for
making this possible they hooked it up
with some of their p7 or project 7
Series parts they all look extremely
nice and see very high quality starting
with the p7 L 240 this is liquid AO 240
millimeter radiator of course the
waterblock is super cool I mean
obviously it's full copper design it's
got a micro channel design as well to
help with the heat dissipation the water
block itself is actually it's got a
built-in reservoir that can hold up to
250 milliliters of liquid so you can
actually refill it drain it put in your
own liquid if you want things like that
so really cool it's also supposed to
have a dual chamber design or a dual
wall for the chamber so it actually
isolates the pump noise and reduces the
the noise output significantly which
should be interesting to test out and we
also have two included 120 millimeter
RGB fans which are pretty cool looking
they do hook up to either a 50/50 header
on your motherboard or I think Eric will
also makes their there p7 hub which
we're going to be using today which can
connect up to five PWM fans or to RGB
devices including RGB fans so very
excited to be using that as
we also have a p7 650 watt platinum
power supply a B+ Platinum rated very
high efficiency rating guys fully
modular design has a lot of mesh open
ventilation for that 140 millimeter RGB
fan which is super cool and all the
cables are black so no ketchup and
mustard business that you have to deal
with and finally we have our case of the
our the p7 c0 Pro which is again from
air oh cool it is an ATX mid tower with
dual tempered glass side panels on
either side it looks fantastic it's a
real it's a real looker it's got plenty
of RGB at the front with 3 120
millimeter RGB PWM fans you can also put
a 360 millimetre radiator at the front
if you so choose there's a dual mounts
for 120 s or 140 millimeter fans at the
top power supply basement plenty of
cable management at the back steel
construction and all that jazz for about
a hundred bucks MSRP so quite a steal
for this case overall but those are
pretty much all the parts that we're
dealing with today sorry I had to rattle
those off quickly because we got a lot
to do still but I actually have other
things to take care of so maybe I'll
maybe I'll have wifey sauce build a
system today use that time cool to you
guys I'm gonna get her over here
summoning wifey sauce summoning the
powers of wifey sauce there she is
Hey are you ready to build yeah all
right let's do it
okay cool
when do we get that elevator installed
all right build completes wifey sauce
has done it yet again looks fantastic
and fine it is ready for Windows
installation you did a pretty nice job
here table and look fantastic as well on
this was your first time installing
liquid-cooled a IO
correct good cooler yep how did I go
with the other p7 LT 40 here it was good
but I did have trouble finding out where
to mount the radiator I first tried to
mount it on the top that was having some
trouble fitting it properly
and realized that the motherboard was
actually interfering with where the
radiator needed to sit top of the
motherboard active erm heat sinks and
stuff like that wasn't giving me enough
clearance rice yeah so basically I had
to mount it on the front of the case
instead which for a while the federal
yeah yeah and actually the the water
block when I first came in to check on
you it was actually mounted 90 degrees
counterclockwise to what it is now so
the tubes are actually on the right side
and that was actually not giving you
enough slack and it was looking that the
tubing was kind of cramped in that
orientation cynically it looks better
now that you rotated 90 degrees the
graphics card is looking pretty good
here we definitely get full-length GPU
support in this case how was the cable
management as far as the backside goes I
mean there's a lot of cables and lot of
wires here yeah the only one that made
it a little bit difficult but
fortunately there's a lot of space over
down here by the power supply and also
like a lot of tie downs the basement
yeah I lost a lot of tied downs for all
the cabling so that made it a little bit
better but but yeah so it turned out
good it also kind of helped that we had
the the PC hub or the p7 hub to kind of
like just direct all of the cables for
the fans and LEDs for those fans just to
one spot we actually mounted that hub at
the front of the case just towards the
bottom there it's not really connected
to anything there's no we it did include
velcro if we want to velcro it down but
it's already pretty cramped back there
so it kind of just stays in place on its
own but yeah you know what I put my
faith in you for this because this is my
own personal editing workstation system
now
and he can do a fantastic job so yeah
well well played well played we're gonna
we're gonna shake hands like the lovely
married couple we are yes of course so
thank you guys so much for tuning and
thank you Eric all for sponsoring this
system and be sure to subscribe for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon
also toss a like on the video give it up
for wifey sauce congratulate her once
again for a successful build in the
comments as always I'm going guys and
we'll see you all in the next video
that's my line</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
