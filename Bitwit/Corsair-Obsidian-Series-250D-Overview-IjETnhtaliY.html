awesomesauce news today I'll be taking a
quick look at Corsairs first-ever Mini
ITX chassis this is their obsidian
series 250 d and it aims to provide a no
compromise solution while maintaining a
significantly smaller form factor than
what we've previously seen from Corsair
so let's take a closer look
keeping in line with other cases from
the Obsidian series the 250 d has a
minimalistic yet elegant aesthetic the
anodized brushed aluminum front panel is
sleek and fairly scratch resistant but
incredibly prone to fingerprints in the
top left corner is a discreet power
button and a tiny recessed reset button
on the right or two USB 3.0 ports and
your mic and headphone jacks they've
also included a single five and a
quarter inch drive bay for ample
marshmallow storage you can also support
a full sized optical drive vs which is
probably more practical but not nearly
as tasty the front panel below can be
lowered by pressing the two marked
pressure points and from there you can
just let it hang out or remove it
completely just behind the panel is a
removable dust filter which is held in
place by two sturdy plastic latches
making it easy to remove clean and
reinstall with the filter out of the way
here's a better look at the preinstalled
140 millimeter fan you can also mount a
200 or 120 millimeter fan or you can
just tell the air to suck it and slap on
a 120 or 140 radiator moving right along
to the back of the case are not one not
two but five thousand thumb screws yeah
there's a lot of thumb screws going on
here guys but they also repurpose rust
assured so right here we've got two 80
millimeter fan mounts you've got two
PCIe slots and a removable bracket held
in place with two of those thumb screws
for a full sized ATX power supply
there's also a second removable dust
filter for your power supply fan which
should have plenty of room for intaking
fresh air underneath the case since the
rubber feet hold the case up about an
inch and a half off the ground to the
left of the power supply mount is
another removable bracket which feels
like some kind of secret door that leads
to the drive cage it's kind of got a
hot-swap vibe going on but don't be
fooled
you'd still have to pop off the side
panel to unplug the drives before you
can actually remove them nonetheless
they've included four plastic to list
Drive trays for up to two two and a half
inch and two three and a half inch
drives now Corsair has decided to put a
tinted acrylic window on top of the case
which i think is a good call considering
the motherboard layout of this chassis
because it gives you a better view of
your main components inside and it opens
up the option for ventilated side panels
both side panels feature generous
ventilation and removable magnetic dust
filters on the inside that are as easy
to remove as they
fun to play with delving deeper into the
cavernous abyss of the 250d you'll find
the motherboard tray that sits right
above the power supply it's also got a
large CPU cutout to facilitate these
sometimes tedious task of installing
your CPU cooler tie-down points for
cables line a couple of the edges of the
motherboard tray and there's even a few
more of them below at the front of your
case it's more apparent here looking at
the case from this angle that you can in
fact fit an ATX power supply of just
about any length there's also some
rubber pads for your power supply to sit
on to reduce noise and vibration this
rather spacious area in the front should
also provide plenty of room to house
your excess cables so they don't impede
airflow in your case or suffer a bloody
murderous death from being eaten by the
front fan but as a safety precaution
Corsair has included a fan grill just in
case now to the right of the motherboard
tray our mounting points for two 120
millimeter fans one of which is already
included you could also remove that fan
and install a 240 millimeter radiator
and this in tandem with the radiator
support at the front of the case gives
the 250 D a ton of potential for custom
water cooling loops now if you wanted to
you could completely remove that
five-minute quarter-inch drive cage up
top but you don't actually need to
remove it in order to install a 240
radiator it would simply just give you a
bit more space to work with now at the
beginning of this video when I said that
this case doesn't make compromises I
wasn't talking about its refusal to
negotiate with terrorists or anything
like that
but rather that the 250 D is aimed at
users with limited desk space who still
want to take advantage of top-tier
current gen hardware which these days
generally tend to be on the bulky side
thankfully the case supports graphics
cards up to 290 millimeters in length
and CPU cooler towers up to 200
millimeters in height making for one
hell of a gaming machine the size of a
toaster oven
but like the climate of a refrigerator
and that's going to wrap it up for this
overview guys once again this has been
the corsair obsidian series 250 d and by
no means necessary is this the smallest
mini ITX case that you can find on the
market right now but you would be
hard-pressed to find one that's as
forgiving in terms of full-size hardware
