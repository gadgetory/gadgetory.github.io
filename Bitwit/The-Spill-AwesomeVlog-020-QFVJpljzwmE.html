Network welcome back to the channel this
is a little vlog video because a if
you're watching this video it means I'm
already off on my way to Coachella which
is an annual music festival I attend
every year with my friends so I have a
really short week this week so I didn't
have time to do a proper review like I
usually do so a vlog video was quite
accommodating for for my hectic week if
you will but the other reason why I'm
vlogging is because I actually have
something worth vlogging about an
incident fatal not fatal honestly fatal
but quite tragic and traumatic incident
happened last night on last of the
stream of Awesome hardware that I did
with Paul so in the last like five
minutes of the stream I accidentally
knocked over
Paul's glass of beer and it spilled all
over my Asus gaming laptop made the 50
20 K overclockable yeah yeah thanks
Intel that sucks yeah I I don't know why
I'm having such bad luck with my
hardware lately not that hardware that
this hardware is working fine no
problems totally functional but in
regards to my tech hardware I it's like
I'm plagued or cursed or something cuz
this kind of crap just keeps following
me around but hopefully I can dig my way
out of this one I don't know if it's
working yet I haven't tested it so
that's kind of why I'm doing this vlog
we're all gonna test it together and
we're all gonna either see it fail or
succeed and I'm really hoping the latter
but basically the beer it was about a
little less than half of a glass half of
a pint is probably the third which
doesn't sound like a lot but almost all
of it
got onto the laptop mainly the keys
obviously I was using it at the time it
was powered on so I immediately turned
it off after after the spillage so it
doesn't short anything so I'm hoping
that everything's okay but here take a
look at it it's right here I have it all
gutted open right now I took the under
side panel off as well as uninstalled
the battery you can even see the
underside panel there's some beer stains
right here I typically like the smell of
beer but not when it's on my laptop it's
not good here's the battery now there
was just some some spillage on the
battery itself like around this area
which I got off pretty
pretty easily and unfortunately there
was no beer that I could tell that had
reached the contact points which is
really important so I think the battery
is okay but what I'm more concerned
about are the keys themselves and just
if the system's working properly at all
I don't I haven't even opened up the
screen I haven't opened up the lid to
see if the keys are crunchy or if
they're sticky I really hope they're not
but I'm gonna go ahead and install the
battery again pop the the under panel on
and we're gonna boot this thing up and I
just hope I hope it works because I
really like this laptop and it's gonna
be okay
alright I got I got you I'm here for you
Shh it's gonna be okay Shh I'm here
alright guys so here's the laptop just
installed the battery haven't turned it
on yet I first wanted to just test out
the keys to see how they feel and
surprisingly they feel perfect it
doesn't like no one would even be able
to tell that any kind of trauma happened
here perfectly flawless they're not
sticky or you know mushy or whatever
everything every key sound feels good I
tested every single key and I'm really
happy about that but I think the
ultimate test is will this turn on you
guys ready I don't know if I am but here
we go
oh is it
could it be oh man if this if this like
boots up and and like I use this for
like a few hours and it's just working
fine I'm gonna be so happy oh oh oh my
oh my
thank God everything looks okay right
now I think I think I might be in the
clear guys but let this be a lesson to
all of you and and myself as well keep
keep your distance between your hardware
and your beer you know be be careful cuz
I've had too many encounters in too
short a time with with accidental
spillage on my on my components and my
hardware so and it's not fun so but I
think I got out of this one
I think I'm scot-free I don't say I'm
scot-free not gone I don't have any
wooden here but I hopefully hopefully
this is working okay
and I don't have to find a replacement
for this thing because I really do like
this laptop but that is just a quick
little update I will I will keep you
guys informed and let you know how the
laptops doing maybe a few days or maybe
a week from now and just kind of let you
know whether it's on Twitter or if it
warrants I don't know if it warrants a
full dedicated video like this one but I
will keep you guys informed and let you
know what's going on with it
so I think on that note oh man I that's
scared me for a second why should just
blue screen right now but thank you guys
for watching this vlog I will continue
making more tech videos as soon as I'm
back from Coachella I don't know if
awesome hardware is going to be a
typical show next week because it's I'm
gonna need a little bit more recovery
time so I think what Paul and I decided
is that we're just gonna be playing a
lot of GTA 5 because that game will
finally be out come Tuesday so thank you
guys for sticking sticking with me and
stay tuned for more stuff coming at you
really soon hope you all have an awesome
weekend and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
