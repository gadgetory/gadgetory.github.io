Josh hey what's up man so look I know
that you said that the core 500 toaster
can fit full-sized video cards and AIO
liquid coolers but dude I can't even fit
the motherboard in the damn thing so
what's the deal what no dude I said the
core 5:30 is like the size of a toaster
what the hell are you doing right now
wait so if that's not the core 500
hippie gonna party one one key don't
probably get it opened up the core 500
from fractal design provides top-class
cooling and supports full-sized hardware
and a compact design click the link in
the description to learn more bread
toasting only supported with AMD chips
what's up everybody welcome to the
channel welcome back
yo today we're gonna be taking a look at
the hyper 212 X turbo turbo just means
that it comes with a second fan it's a
CPU cooler from Coolermaster you guys
are pretty familiar with it because it's
the long-awaited successor to the hyper
212 Evo which I have right here on my
5960 X so this is this has been a long
time coming we had the the hyper 212
plus in 20 2009 and then two years later
we got the Evo and then five years down
the line finally we get a successor to
that it's a $40 MSRP so $10 more than
the Evo and I'll tell you by the end of
this video whether or not it's worth it
so obviously this is a super popular if
not the most popular CPU cooler line
ever and the reason why it's it's so
damn you know highly praised is because
of its price to performance for 30 bucks
or so you could buy something like the
the hyper 212 Evo and really have a lot
of overclocking potential I mean right
now I have this this 59 60 X overclocked
240 400 megahertz and then coolermaster
has definitely set the bar when it comes
to value oriented air coolers so that's
why this is kind of an exciting product
to talk about first off let's let's talk
about just the basics it's compatible
with like pretty much every current
socket and like I said it does come in
the turbo edition with two fans where's
the second fan over here so you can get
the turbo edition with two fans and
that's going to cost you a premium I
wouldn't recommend that because the
performance difference between one and
two fans isn't that Drass
it's not worth the extra 10 20 bucks
that you pay for for the turbo edition
so I would recommend you know the the
just a regular type or - 12 X with one
fan cuz I think one fans all you need
you know unless you're a YouTube channel
then it's nice to have many fans haha
and now I have none but why don't we
talk about that what's what's new about
this fan because it definitely is
different than the the one that the Evo
came with so first off we've got a
different housing right so it's not
glossy actually nothing on this fan is
glossy
whereas all you get was glass all you
got was glass on the Evo fan it was
super reflective not everyone's a huge
fan of that I know I'm personally not
the fan the shape of the fan blade
itself is exactly the same however
there's these little ridges these little
uh kind of little mini speed bumps on
the edges of the blades which I guess
creates more airflow or maybe it makes
it more quiet couldn't find any
information on it but it just it could
just be a minor design difference for
aesthetic purposes but it's essentially
the same blade I would say it is gray
that's great color not glossy black so
that's different what's really different
about this new fan from the ex is its
bearing so it's using a P om or palm
bearing I don't know it's it stands for
something like polyethylene something I
don't know but what you need to know
about that is that it essentially is
self lubricating a and that's one of
several features that allows this fan to
have a much longer lifespan than the Evo
so 160,000 hours on the Nu X fan however
you only get 40,000 hours on the Evo so
good shit oh yeah for pin for pin pwm
fan header right there just the same as
the Evo as well and then we've also got
the heatsink so there's a some
similarities here which is the direct
contact copper heat pipes there's still
six millimeters there's still four of
them and they are still making direct
contact with your the heat spreader on
your CPU remember the the hyper 212 plus
still had that direct contact feature
however the pipes were separated a bit
like a couple millimeters apart and that
created some air gaps and didn't really
you know maximize the the surface area
so that's good if they've stuck stuck
with this design here on the X alright
now as for the heatsink this is actually
probably the biggest difference coming
from the Evo 2
X is in the heatsink design so
particularly with the fin array we've
got these little cutouts that are around
the heat pipes little X shaped cutouts
and even though we can only see it on
the top layer here this this actually
goes for every single one of the fins in
this stack they all have these little
punch outs what that essentially does is
it creates little pockets of turbulence
little instances of turbulence around
the heat pipes so that air flow can more
effectively pass through those hotspot
areas because this is really where the
fans where a family fun the most
resistance trying to push through a
heatsink is is these big-ass heat pipes
that are getting in the way and you've
also got these other little cutouts
these little bitches here a little
little perforated holes that form a
v-shape again this goes for every single
one of the fins here and what that does
is it directs air flow towards these two
hot spots so not only is airflow being
more easily passed through it's also
being directed in in those two general
directions for greater heat dissipation
yeah technology marketing marketing blah
blah marketing those are all the things
for for the actual cooler and the
heatsink and the fan the design let's
briefly talk about installation alright
because CPU coolers they're a pain in
the ass most of the time you get a new
CPU cooler it's a new mounting mechanism
or a new mounting system that you've
never seen before it's the only thing
when you're building a computer that you
really have to pull out the freaking
manual for other than some motherboard
shit once in a while but it can be a
real bang when you're building so I was
really happy to see that the mounting
system here for the X is exactly the
same as it is for the Evo in fact you
don't even need the accessory box that
comes with the with the X if you already
have an Evo if you're upgrading from an
Evo or something you can just use all
the same you know the X mounting bracket
the same nuts and bolts and and what
have you it's all exactly
interchangeable super easy to do so
really happy about that moving on a
performance guys I'm gonna give you some
temp numbers some temp ranges and you
even have to take those with a grain of
salt just because the ambient
temperature in my room is constantly
fluctuating so with the with the hyper
212 Evo 59 60 X overclocked 240 400
megahertz we're getting about anywhere
from 59 to 65 degrees Celsius but with
the Evo it's essentially the same same
kind of range except it's maybe a degree
or two cooler so you're looking at
anywhere from you know 57 degrees
Celsius to 63 so not a huge improvement
there is some though I was worried that
it was just gonna be exactly the same
across the board it does seem that this
performs a slightly slightly cooler then
it's a older brother damn someone's
getting the is that a copper is that an
ambulance I can never tell doesn't
matter the ruining my video I also ran
some tests with both fans installed the
new fans of course on the Model X Tesla
don't zooming and not much of a
difference maybe one or two degrees in
that range that I gave you so you know
just - take off a degree or two so it is
slightly cooler but honestly not worth
paying the extra 10 20 30 bucks on
Newegg right now that this is $70 which
is insane and for the to fan from the
turbo version luckily you can just get
the single fan version on Newegg for I
think like $40 which is way more
reasonable and I would go for that in a
heartbeat but don't get the don't buy
the turbo for $70 just don't do that I'm
telling you right now it's I don't know
what the hell's going on with new
expressing right now acoustics I almost
forgot to talk about acoustics I'm glad
I caught myself so really quick the
hyper 212 line has always been known for
not just its performance or its
affordability but also for having a
really silent profile and luckily that
reputation isn't broken here with the
hyper 212 X for example I couldn't even
tell the difference between the Evo fan
versus one of the X fans versus two of
the X fans
it's just virtually silent so especially
with and that's with an open air test
bed mind you so if you're installing
this into a traditional ATX tower for
example you've got a side panel door or
side panel window on it covering it's
enclosed you're not going to hear it
even under load but just to prove it to
you I did a sound test with this boom
mic right here which is super sensitive
I was about anywhere from six to eight
inches away from the cooler so why don't
we go ahead and check out what that
sounds like
so here's here's the deal guys I'm just
going to sum things up if you're
building a new computer then I would go
for the hyper to 12x the non turbo just
get the single fence all you need it's
going to last you a long time 160,000
hours apparently and you'll be able to
overclock again 4,400 megahertz
however if you already have a hyper 212
plus or a hyper 212 Evo and there's
nothing wrong with it it's just old then
I don't see a point in really upgrading
to this because you're in view the
performance is going to be minimal it's
not worth spending 40 bucks four to
three degrees cooler temperatures in my
opinion if you're really you know like a
freaking fiend with that sort of thing
then you got the money then go for it
but for the average user buy this if if
you're buying new but if you're
upgrading just keep your your freaking
Evo it's it's a good cooler still and it
still has a long ways before it's
completely obsolete and that ladies and
gentlemen is pretty much all I have to
say about this here CPU kula yeah it's
good I like it she's a keeper
but yeah if you guys didn't notice I
shot this video in a very similar format
as the last video I did which was the
HyperX cloud revolver gaming headset and
I asked you guys for feedback on that
type of format a lot of you guys like
the unscripted format which I was kind
of surprised about even though the old
you know the traditional scripted you
know write me writing jokes and stuff
those types of reviews aren't gonna go
anywhere I think I kind of do enjoy
doing these more more casual
lighthearted types of videos so maybe
you'll see more of these in the near
future so yeah thanks guys subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already I've
got a bunch more stuff on that product
shelf over there that's waiting to be
videoed and reviewed and whatnot so that
should be exciting and hope you all have
a good day or evening or morning or
whatever time it is thank you all for
watching and until next time I'll see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
