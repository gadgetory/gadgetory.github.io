to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info alright
guys so I just got back from the zotac
suite at CES 2018 and they had a lot of
stuff to show off I think the most
eye-catching thing for me was their mini
box they're super high-end Magnus mini
gaming PC with an 8th gen Intel
processor so we get six cores on this
bad boy
I believe the clock speed is four point
six gigahertz so that's fantastic this
is a full-fledged full desktop CPU and
that's gonna be paired with a
full-fledged desktop GPU which is the
GTX 1080 this thing is an absolute
powerhouse especially just for how small
it is so tech is calling it the most
powerful mini gaming PC in the world I
haven't really fact-checked that yet but
it does sound promising so that's super
fun it's got two DIMM slots if you
wanted to slot up to 32 gigs of DDR 4 in
there you could easily do so it's very
serviceable you pretty much buy the unit
bare-bones and upgraded as you as you as
you see fit we're gonna upgrade it but
populate it as you see fit depending on
your needs it's got a single m2 slot
with a 2.5 inch drive slot as well so
that's really nice gives you some extra
flexibility you're not just limited to
one drive as we often see in a lot of
these mini pcs there's a front panel
that has a large illuminated power
button an SD card reader USB 3.1 type A
&amp;amp; C and your audio jacks on the back you
get a couple of Wi-Fi antenna DC power
four USB three two Ethernet ports a
Kensington lock and of course two
expansion slots you could technically
upgrade your GPU later down the line if
you wanted to but just bear in mind
you'd still be operating within the
thermal and power limitations of the
rest of the system at the end of the day
we're getting an extremely powerful yet
very portable system that's gonna be
good for gaming and even video editing
for example different workstation
applications I wouldn't I would love to
have something like this for CES to be
honest but you guys let me know what you
think about it in the comments below not
sure on pricing or availability yet just
know that it's gonna be out sometime
this year in 2018 as always feel free to
toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it and get subscribed to the
channel for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon
from CES 2018 have a good one guys and
I'll see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
