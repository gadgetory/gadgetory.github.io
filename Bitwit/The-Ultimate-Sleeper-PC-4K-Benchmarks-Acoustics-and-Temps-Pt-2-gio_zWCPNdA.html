just a quick follow-up video to the
original sleeper PC video where I
essentially put sixteen hundred dollars
worth of hardware inside of a
ten-year-old HP Pavillion case don't ask
me why I do the things that I do just go
watch the video if you haven't seen it
yet
now putting DIY components in a chassis
that's specifically designed for pre
build systems presents a lot of
challenges like limited hardware support
acoustics and airflow and while I've
already found ways to cram the case with
more PC parts than it's really built for
it's time to fire up some games to see
if our noise levels and temperatures are
workable enough to call this a practical
and sustainable system and just to make
things more interesting I've gone ahead
and overclocked our 6700 K 240 400
megahertz and our gtx 980ti to 14
hundred and 60 megahertz
we'll also be running our benchmarks at
quad HD and 4k for good measure so with
that in mind folks let's kick things off
with our acoustics test before rounding
things out with a look at performance
and thermals enjoy
all right so circling back to acoustics
while our tests show that the sleeper
build is far from silent the system hums
quietly at idle and is actually
tolerable under load even if it is a tad
louder than today's average mid tower
use some headphones while gaming and the
noise drops out completely performance
wise it's pretty clear that this system
can handle quad HD gaming in its sleep
as we saw the minimum FPS often soar
above 60 heck it can probably even
scrape by at 4k if you bump some of the
settings down though I personally side
with the smoother gameplay at 1440 this
kind of performance doesn't just bode
well for gaming but could benefit an HD
editing workflow as well perhaps where
the system takes the biggest hit is in
regards to thermals not for the CPU as
we saw decent temps in the low 60s
but our gtx 980ti was topping eighty
degrees Celsius in some games putting it
closer to reference temps than the
aftermarket ZOTAC cooler which by the
way capped at a mild 68 degrees Celsius
on my open-air testbed since this case
isn't designed to accommodate a $700
high end GPU the lack of chassis support
for intake fans near the graphics card
comes as no surprise and is ultimately
the biggest shortcoming of this system
let's also not forget that the hotter
the GPU gets the more heat it gives off
to the other components and it should be
pretty evident by now that building in a
tight case such as this one might have
benefited more from a reference design
card that blows air exclusively out the
back while this certainly comes with the
cost of building an epic sleeper rig
it's important to note that these
temperatures still fall within safe
operating ranges and can be further
controlled with the help of fan and
monitoring applications overall I am
very pleased with how this bill turned
out despite the odds and perhaps I'll
even bring it with me to CES come
January to see how well she lives up to
these Sleeper moniker but that's gonna
do it for now guys drop me some love in
the comments before you go and don't
forget to toss me a like on this video
