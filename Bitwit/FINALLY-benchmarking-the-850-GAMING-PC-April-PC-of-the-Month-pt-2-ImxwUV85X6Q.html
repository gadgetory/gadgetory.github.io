what anything no oh the next stuff cool
it makes stuff cool whoa that that's not
supposed to happen
yeah hey where's right I need this this
isn't good you know it's fine it's just
a little wardrobe malfunction nothing we
can't handle
where the heck did this Corvette come
from
the does he even have a life no he does
not we spray put this somewhere say
you're still with the Celsius line of
all-in-one liquid coolers from fractal
design it's easy to stay cool click on
the link in the description for more
info what's going on guys welcome back
to the channel hope you're all doing
well so I got to fess up to something
back in April I built this fantastic
machine this was April's PC of the
monthly budget 1440p gaming rig for
eight hundred and fifty dollars but
unlike most other PC of the months I did
not follow through with a part to giving
you guys the full look at all the gaming
benchmarks thermals acoustics and all
that jazz so yeah that was that was my
bad I'm sorry the some of you guys have
been waiting on that for so long I kind
of got swept up with the Hawaii trip I
took with my family then Computex right
afterwards it's just been complete
madness for the last couple months so
finally the dust is settled and I can
now give you guys some performance
numbers on this PC so you can go ahead
and watch the build video on that if you
haven't seen it yet but just as a quick
refresher we are rockin arisin v 1600
processor that's a 6 for 12 thread part
which I have overclocked for this test
to 3.9 gigahertz on all cores that's
running stable at the stock voltage I
didn't touch the vcore anything 3.9
gigahertz guys so that's fantastic
along with 16 gigs of g.skill ripjaws v
ddr4 and 32 hundred megahertz rated but
unfortunately even with the latest bios
update i was only able to get it to run
at 3066 megahertz which isn't a huge
step down so it shouldn't affect our our
frame rates that much so I'm pretty I'm
okay with that for now and then we've
also got the rx 580 from this is the
power color red devil and this card
comes factory overclocked out of the box
so just to be mindful of the thermal
limitations here inside of the spec Alfa
case from Corsair I decided not to
overclock the GPU any further and just
run out of the box settings it's still
well above reference speed so so it has
that going for it but overall I did not
really touch anything
on the GPU apart from that we are
running on the d3 50 chipset from AMD
this is an asus prime b3 50-plus
motherboard again with the latest bios
and the one shortcoming the one big
downfall to this system that i
specifically even mentioned in the part
1 video was that it only has a single
mechanical hard drive so i did also
mention in that video that if you had
any sort of even like succeed 80 bucks
to spare to seriously consider buying an
SSD and there's the alarm on my phone
going off mother so if you had any
wiggle room at all with your eight
hundred and fifty dollar budget again an
SSD even 128 gig SSD i feel like in a
budget system would be totally worth it
just install your operating system and a
couple basic programs your web browser
etc and leave everything else to the
mechanical hard drive that way you can
still save a ton of money as opposed to
going with like two hundred and forty or
a 500 gig SSD but still benefit from the
faster load in boot times so let's talk
about thermals our risin 5 1600 actually
spiked up to 86 degrees celsius at one
point but it was kind of an outlier i
didn't see it go or reach into the 80s
any other time during our 15 20 minute
run in GTA 5 in actuality the package
hovered in the mid 70s pretty much the
entire time which considering that we're
only using the included breaks fire
stock cooler that came with the cpu
that's actually not bad at all so I'm
happy with that the GPU again all these
thermals were tested with an ambient
temperature of 27 degrees Celsius in my
room and with the 5 panel on despite
what you see here the GPU got up to 76
degrees Celsius so yeah I think there
was there's also a little bit of thermal
Headroom there if we did want to go in
and dial in an overclock to see to see
how much further we could push the Red
Devil here the arts 580 then I feel like
we probably could afford a couple more
degrees before we get into like the low
eighty territory which is where I
usually personally like to cut it off so
after spending a whole day gaming on
this system the thermal seemed pretty
reasonable all things considered which
isn't too surprising because we've got a
really nice airflow path in the spec
alpha we've got to 122 the front one one
120 at the back kind of a nice front to
back path of airflow that we have here
and that sort of leads us into acoustics
so the overall noise emissions of this
chassis we're pretty impressive the case
fans for one are linked up to the
the built-in fan controller on the Speck
alpha which I had on the middle setting
so there's low medium and high
we were running it on medium the entire
time very quiet fans surprising for such
a cheap case and the rates fire on its
own is just freakishly quiet without
sort of any any kind of tuning involved
the one caveat here was the graphics
card which did emit a degree of coil
wine which is not terribly noticeable
with the side panel on you almost have
to be in a room with zero ambient noise
to even pick it up so thankfully it's
not too noticeable in this chassis
however if you're considering this
graphics card and in the events that
these particular models are known to
cause any element of coil line then
beware that you're not picking up a
chassis that has a ton of ventilation
open mesh or something on the side panel
closer to the graphics card because then
there will be a lot of sound bleed and
it will get obnoxious I think so just
something to bear in mind but I think on
that note we can go ahead and talk about
gaining benchmarks I ran six games in
total at two resolutions at 1920 by 1080
and of course 2560 by 1440 which again
this is being advertised as a budget
gaming rig for that resolution for quad
HD so to speak but that being said
there's a you know people have their
different preferences on the framerate
range that they like to game at some
people are perfectly happy with you know
50s and 60s on average other people are
like hell no nothing below 75 IMO you
know or whatever it is so because of
that I decided to run both resolutions
just in case you were considering
specking out a future system similar to
this one but maybe you don't you're not
very happy with 1440p numbers we're
about to see then at least you know what
you could achieve at 1920 by 1080 so
Windows 10 64-bit all the latest
revision drivers have been installed and
we're using the newest BIOS version for
our motherboard on that note ladies and
gentlemen it is with great honor that I
finally present to you the long overdue
benchmarks for our budget 1440p game
and Darby you're benchmarks ladies and
gentlemen what do you guys think overall
let me know what do you think about the
1080p
versus the 1440 t numbers are the
average frame rates enough for you guys
or like where are we at here where are
we at is that is you see those number to
be like could be a lot faster for the
money or do you see me be like that's a
respectable and reasonable average frame
rate to be running at I don't know let
me know what you think in the comments
below my personal opinion I mean based
on the results just to quickly recap at
1440p we were seeing anywhere from the
50s to the 70s in terms of average frame
rates which i think is perfectly
adequate for the the games that we were
running a lot of with many of which all
of which were triple-a titles most of
which we're running at max settings with
the exception of GTA 5 that was a blend
of high and very high no anti-aliasing
things like that but for the most part I
think that's pretty solid and at 1080p
we were seeing I would say 24 25 and
fame rates and even on the the 1% or
0.1% lows going from 50s and 70s range
to now 70s and 90s range which i think
is absolutely fantastic for the money
again but there you guys have it I can't
stress this enough though if you are
going to build a system include an SSD
if you possibly can because it is going
to improve the overall experience not
just with your gaming but with your
general day-to-day tasking and computing
as well so that's pretty much I've run
once again run out of things to say so
I'm just going to call it quits right
here guys
finally the results have been given to
the public let me know what your
thoughts are as always guys pass me a
