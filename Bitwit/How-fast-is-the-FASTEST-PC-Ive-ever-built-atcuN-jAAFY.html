channel hope you're all doing well it is
good to be back here in the studio
never spend eight days straight in Las
Vegas Nevada you will go insane but all
things considered I'm feeling pretty
good I want to talk to you guys about
the enthu elite bill that I assembled
late last year and I think we're ready
for testing it in Boots it's all good to
go it's up and running and it's very
impressive on paper this is about a
$12,000 rig more or less and so now I
want to actually put it through the
wringer to see what it's made of in this
video we'll be talking about
overclocking our CPU and both of our
GPUs that are in our SLI configuration
as well as taking a look at gaming
performance and even some some
benchmarks when it comes to our nvme
raid 0 array which is also quite beastly
if you guys haven't watched part 1
through 3 the the whole build process
from start to finish that's up you can
go ahead and check it out if you want
you can watch it before after this one
at any rates for those of you who have
not seen those videos or if you just
need a refresher I'll quickly go over
the specs we've got a core i 9 79 80 X
II which has been it's the gamers Nexus
Edition because it was a handle it by
Steve aka Tech Jesus himself our
motherboard is the rampage 6 Xtreme X
299 and that's gonna be fitted with 128
gigs of G scale treta and z RGB ddr4 at
3200 megahertz
we've also got two aces Strix OSI models
GTX 1080p is in sli as well as our boot
drive which is a 250 gig samsung 960 Evo
paired with a pair of 2 terabyte 960 pro
m2 nvme SSDs that are in a raid 0
configuration giving us a 4 terabyte
nvme raid 0 array the top it all off we
have our CPU VRMs and both of our
graphics cards being cooled by a dual
custom bloop all of this taking place
inside of the beautiful fantex
and the elite case being powered by a
1200 watt DF series power supply from
banner packs so if that's not impressive
enough just wait till you see the
numbers kids let's talk about some data
but actually first hold on rewind let's
let's do some overclocking first in fact
I've already done all the testing of
course so I will share with you what
kind of OCS I was able to hit starting
with our 79 80
x/e I initially started at 4.0 gigahertz
and sort of worked my way up
overclocking on this motherboard is
extremely easy you pretty much only have
to dial in the core multiplier and you
can set the vcore the voltage for the
CPU to auto and it will automatically
just scale up the voltage as needed and
basically what I was able to come out
with was 4.6 gigahertz as an all core
overclock on all 18 cores 4.6 6
gigahertz was where I found ultimate
stability with the exception of Adobe
Premiere Pro Creative Cloud
in fact I ran all of my gaming met every
single benchmark I ran first and then I
ran Adobe Premiere Pro at the very end
not the best idea now I know to run
Premiere Pro first because it is the
most likely to crash in fact I was only
able to successfully render out a file
from your pro at 4.1 gigahertz so that
was the stable clock speed for rendering
but everything else was able to work
flawlessly at 4.6 gigahertz and that
gave us a vid or B ID of 1.2 to Center I
didn't really see a need to overclock
our memory 3200 speed is already pretty
fast especially for an Intel platform
system you don't really need to increase
the megahertz that fast with ddr4 in
order to pump out more or additional
gaming performance that works more
closely with Rison and and how the
Infinity fabric works there but until
not so much so I just aimed for our
rated speed of 30 300 megahertz it was
very easy I went to the UEFI and
selected the 32 hundred megahertz
profile and boom voila
on the next boot it was operating at
that rated speed no problems as far as
our GTX 1080p eyes are concerned I maxed
out their power and temperature limit
sliders and I was able to get away with
a 100 megahertz core clock offset on
both of them which doesn't seem like a
lot but keep in mind that these are
already factory overclocked so there
isn't a ton of ceiling room once you get
it out of the box so 100 megahertz on
the core clock was the offset there and
then I got a 300 megahertz core memory
clock offset on the memory of course
this was all achieved without touching
the voltage we're using stock voltage
here and with that I was able to achieve
a maximum core clock frequency of
nineteen hundred and eighty-seven
megahertz
and then I think it was what was it
thirteen hundred and eighty-nine
megahertz for the memory clock was the
Mex we hit there that was for the the
top primary GPU the secondary GPU that
was slotted in beneath it ran about ten
megahertz slower on both the core clock
and memory clock frequencies so it makes
sense because even in SLI supported
games you're not gonna have that second
GPU being utilized quite as much as the
primary card in all of my testing that's
inclusive of 2k and 4k tests I only saw
a maximum VRAM usage on either card of
about six and a half gigs so plenty of
gddr5 X to go around on that front now
we can talk about temperatures as far as
the CPU goes we were idling anywhere
between thirty and forty five degrees
Celsius occasionally it would spike up
to you know 50 or something like that
but for the vast majority of the time we
were we were hovering in the 30s and 40s
which is fantastic Oh as far as gaming
loads we saw a maximum CPU temp again
this is at four point six gigahertz with
18 cores and 36 threads guys we saw 69
degrees Celsius was the hottest my CPU
got and I would attribute that to to the
to the dedicated water cooling loop as
well as the delayed process that gamers
Nexus was was able to pitch in here so I
think that did wonders for our
temperature 69 degrees is very favorable
in case you were curious that was after
about half an hour in battlefield one
and then another 15 20 minutes in gta5
back-to-back we did not even hit 70
degrees C on our beastly overclocked ins
CPU there so the only time I really felt
like I had to keep a close eye on our
CPU temps was when we were rendering
some 4k footage in Adobe Premiere Pro
and media encoder only then did I see
the CPU spike well over 70 degrees and
actually hit 84 degrees C at its very
hottest and that was on the package that
was the package temp it was rendering a
10 minute clip so it took about 8 8 to
10 minutes or so for the CPU to get that
hot had I've been rendering a much
longer video for example perhaps we
might have seen the temperatures rise
even further as far as our GPU
temperatures are concerned we saw very
favorable results when idling at just
28 degrees Celsius and then under load
either playing battlefield 1 or GTA 5
for about half an hour to an hour
we actually saw our primary card only
get up to 42 C whereas our secondary
card was a little bit cooler than that
at 40 degrees Celsius so overall we're
hovering in the very low 40s under a
heavy load at 4k these games were run at
4k so it definitely taxes the GPUs a bit
more there but we're still seeing very
very nice results with our dedicated
water cooling loop there it is worth
noting that all of the thermal testing
and all of the the actual gaming tests
that were ran today were conducted with
the side panels of the case on in their
rightful place the top and front panels
everything was on it was an enclosed
case everything was in its rightful
place where it should be there's no open
air testing also the the latest driver
was used the latest wiffle driver for
all of our tests that's three nine zero
six six six six six six five and I did
run tests at both 2k 2560 by 1440
and 4k 3840 by 2160 I did omit all of
the 1080 gaming benchmarks simply
because didn't really feel it was super
relevant for a balls-to-the-wall system
such as this one I just wanted to leave
all of the high-end stuff in on that
note let's roll tape and check a look
and check a look tick tick oh wow and
take a look at the performance
benchmarks for the one and only and
through elite build enjoy
pretty impressive stuff I do say so
myself
so some observations that I'll point out
every game that was run at 2560 by 1440
pretty much topped 70 FPS on average in
fact the average over all the seven
games we tested for frame rates was
about 139 fps
actually but at the very least every
single game was well above 70 FPS when
it came to 4k we saw every game except
one get over 60 FPS on average that one
game being a pub G which makes sense
because pub G is terribly optimized for
SLI at the moment so I think it got like
55 FPS on average which still isn't bad
but when you consider how much money is
in a 1080 TI SLI setup it doesn't seem
like a huge ROI but nonetheless on
average every single game or the total
of our games averaged it out to about 97
fps at 4k additionally one percent in
point one percent lows were kind of
about where they should be I feel like
some of the games looked a little bit
low especially the point the point one
percent lows that could indicate a bit
of stuttering because we are running a
multi GPU set up where stuttering is a
bit more common in that scenario the
only real oddball observation that I
found was in doom where the frame times
were actually worse at to cake than they
were at 4k GTA 5 was the only title that
indicated a significant CPU bottleneck
in the simple fact that there was hardly
any performance drop-off when going from
4k to 2k which is kind of a bittersweet
thing for me because on one hand I'm
really glad that the system isn't
showing signs of CPU bottlenecking as
much as I thought it would but on the
other hand I should have put some tight
next little peas in there clearly the
CPU could have held a bit more graphical
horsepower and now I feel like an idiot
for building a crappy system I can't
even look at it anymore
now while the gaming performance here
has no doubt left you aroused in the
most peculiar way equally impressive are
the numbers we're seeing from our raid 0
array with those 2 2 terabyte 960 pro m2
nvme SSDs so let's go ahead and look at
my cheat sheet right here we're getting
some crazy reason I used crystal disk
mark for the benchmark and
getting some sequential reads and writes
at queue depth thirty-two of six
thousand seven hundred and seventy eight
megabytes per second reads and 3917
megabytes per second writes the other
results using the four kilobyte transfer
size that various queue depths are no
doubt less impressive but they are more
indicative of real-world day-to-day
tasking than the sequential reads and
writes so still very very favorable
numbers all around I mean I cannot
complain now at this point in my lengthy
benchmarking session I could have called
it a day right there since I had pretty
much tested everything that I had sought
out to benchmark but I didn't stop there
I decided to whip out my own
multitasking torture test just to see
how the system would behave so what I
essentially did was I opened up an
instance of battlefield one running at
4k in windowed mode this was on Ultra
settings mind you then I began rendering
a 10-minute 4k file at 40 megabits per
second using Adobe Media encoder on top
of that I started streaming with OBS at
3,500 kilobits or megabits per second
and that was at 1080p 60 frames per
second and as you might expect from a
high-end $12,000.00 system built by
yours truly it crashed at 4.1 gigahertz
the frequency I had deemed stable to run
Adobe Premiere Pro and media encoder act
so I basically had to knock it down to
4.0 gigahertz at that point everything
ran like clockwork no crashes no errors
it actually rendered out the video
granted it took about three to four
times longer than it did when we were
only just rendering and the gaming
wasn't all that smooth granted we had
some really playable framerates but we
did encounter some stuttering mainly
because the CPU was already at a hundred
percent from rendering alone and all of
a sudden we were using we're throwing a
CPU intensive game at it while streaming
which is also very CPU intensive so
there was some stuttering but I mean
there was playable it is all to say that
it's pretty badass system if you're
curious at all it was eating up about 30
gigabytes of my D Ram at any given
moment which is a shit ton of RAM but
you know given the configuration that I
had it's only about a little over 20% of
my overall memory being used and I just
realized something I lied to you earlier
in this video I said that 84 degrees
Celsius was the hottest I saw
CPU get raw during this torture test it
spiked up to 91 degrees Celsius which is
quite toasting at the same time when you
consider everything that it was doing
with an all-court overclock at 4
gigahertz on 18 cores early and that
being said this is a very rare scenario
that I probably won't find myself in too
often that is the definition of rare
good job Kyle are the GPUs we're
actually hitting 32 to 33 degrees
Celsius and you're like whoa wait how is
that possible the gp's are running
cooler when it was gaming and doing all
this other stuff as opposed to just
gaming when it was like 40 to 42 degrees
Celsius that's because the GPU
utilization was actually way down low we
were seeing anywhere from 25 to 40
percent utilization on both cards and
one explanation I have from that is that
we were rendering at the time with the
mercury playback engine feature enabled
in Adobe Premiere Pro CC which utilizes
CUDA so technically these cards were
already sort of being used by the
encoder perhaps that's why they weren't
able to deliver as much output for our
actual game winding things down here
overall this system performs exactly how
I would expect it to which is very good
at everything I'm pretty much convinced
at this point to turn this thing into my
daily driver for video editing here at
the office that's exactly what I plan to
do so guys let me know what you think in
the comments below what you thought of
all the results that we shared today and
also feel free to toss me a like on this
video if you enjoyed it it helps me a
lot don't forget to get subscribed so
you don't miss any more tech stuff
coming at you really soon and feel free
to follow me on floatplane so you can
watch all my videos a week early without
Al's I'll drop a link for that in the
description wood apart from that guys
thank you so much for tuning in I am so
glad to be back because I mentioned
before can't wait to start making some
more awesome content for you guys here
in 2018 super excited for all that thank
you all for sticking with me have a good
one and I will see you guys in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
