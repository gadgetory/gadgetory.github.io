through and the feed is good then hello
and welcome to awesome hardware episode
15 I am Kyle and usually I coast the
show with my buddy Paul but he is away
on business right now in Taiwan for
computex 2015 doing all that fun
business I hope he doesn't get deathly
ill over there from being overseas he's
not a fan of seafood so god help him but
in his place i have with me a very
awesome person this is matt philly matt
how's it going oh it's it's going it's
definitely gone it's always going and
Matt 44 I know a lot of people in chat
already know who you are and what you do
but for those of us who don't I won't
you tell us a little bit about yourself
what you do and where people can find
you as well yes so basically a lot of
people know me as swashing or the pimp
could not not really i just made that up
now the pimp part but uh yeah i do pimp
my setup you know I've had a lot of cool
people on like your name's Kyle right
now should maybe I've had you on pole on
lioness all those people which is
basically how people find me but people
submit setups and then it's kind of the
same thing as this it's it's kind of
funny how that works out right no yeah I
mean yeah you like okay so let's let's
just lay the the rumors to rest if
there's any uncertainty Matt started the
pit my thing first I mean I mean
technically MTV did with ya the pit my
right but matt has been doing his show
pimp my setup on youtube.com slash
watching TV if you wanna check it out
for way longer than Paul and I have been
doing I actually contacted matt DM dim
through Twitter was like hey dude we've
got this great idea for a show it's
basically your show but instead of desk
setups we use pcs is it cool if we do it
and and you were so gracious to to give
us your blessing and that really meant a
lot and I mean not that it wouldn't
really have mattered regardless but it
was a nice gesture for him to ask so I
appreciate that but uh as long as I'm
not getting sued by MTV I think we're
all good that's really well yeah exactly
right I'm still waiting for that
subpoena soon soon some hairy man shows
up at my door but yeah I mean like like
that was saying I was a special guest on
his show oh I don't know month month or
two ago and super fun show and by the
way thank you
not giving me the diss courtesy of
showing up like three hours late like I
did on your show I was like literally
throw like three or two or three hours
late ish and I was great still so sorry
about that but oh good you've been very
punctual I really appreciate it but I
think oh I even I don't know if you have
the stream up right now but I even
created this little text to go under
your name boom might be a little delay
there but there's his Twitter handles
Matt Matt philly at hit my setup as well
as his YouTube handle watching TV please
go check him out he's super awesome he
does great work super high quality stuff
and good streams as well but this going
back to the show itself and the format
we're going to be switched it up because
of Matt's background and what Matt does
I figured it'd be kind of cool if we did
a special extended pimp my pc segment
for this episode so we're going to be
taking a look at many more of your
systems than we usually do on a single
given show and Matt and I are going to
be critiquing it and and poking around
giving you guys advice and suggestions
on how you can really pimp it out and
make it look the way it's supposed to
but Matt I know you recently built a pc
yourself haven't you yeah my first ever
build and it's an x 99 so you know I
starting big I like that and it's ah
it's just you can't even hear it it's so
quiet it's beautiful and I I've had it
for a month and it's just been amazing
that's awesome yeah we hope we all like
it big here on awesome hardware so we're
glad you feel the same way but you you
actually um you streamed your entire
build live didn't you on Twitter yeah
yep all 37 hours of it straight no sleep
okay yeah it was like maybe six or seven
but that's only because I listened to
the community which can be great but
also terrible so yeah it's not like it's
kind of like a twitch plays pokemon
right where everyone is doing but it's
like twitch builds Matt's computer and
because of that it takes like five times
longer than it should have but that's
super cool that's definitely a cool
experience for for your first pc that's
that's definitely memorable I have to
say the least but okay first first off
before we jump right into it there's a
couple things I wanted to go with to
start off with first off is just quick
and
Spence the first of which being Paul and
I are still selling shirts if you want
to go check out our merch store you can
go to awesomesauce network.com slash
store and buy a shirt I'm running out of
a lot of the sizes it's been really
popular lately but I will be restocking
soon so I know there's a lot of mediums
out there a lot of mediums who are
struggling and don't have shirts on at
this very moment but they will be back
in stock pretty soon also Paul is still
selling stuff as well he just got a new
inventory stock supply of these English
pub glasses as well as some mugs he's
got a new logo on there as well looks
really nice it's a thumbscrew very fancy
stuff for reasonable prices as well so
go ahead and check it out at paul's
hardware dot net so yeah I just got to
do that shameless plug right there and
before we we jump right into i guess i
guess the thick of it with with all
these pcs that you guys have sent in
which look great by the way i kind of
want to break the ice a bit for
especially for those of you who have
questions for Matt and open it up to a
Q&amp;amp;A right from the get-go so they can
ask you or me questions I know people
are probably tired of me and sick of me
by now but if you guys have any
questions particularly format or myself
go ahead and fire away in chat and we
will be answering them to the best of
our ability but there's a bit of a delay
so while they're generating ideas and
stuff in chat I have a question for you
how has life been since you quit best
buy because you quit best buy pretty
recently yeah yeah it's it's almost
coming up on a month and let's just say
before the show I was chillin in my hot
tub you know that life is pretty good
because I could I could make my own
schedule and it's you know it's not easy
obviously especially when you're still
under 20 because you're considered like
a kid to these companies where you're
trying to get sponsors and stuff but for
the most part I love it and I just I
need to get more videos going and what
not but it's nice to not be in retail
and have people throwing bags at you and
cursing at you for return policies so so
far pretty good like it seems like
you're in a much less abusive
environment now than you were until you
really need to come it's something it's
like twice as abusive exactly but that's
awesome dude that that's that's
definitely a big step
I remember when I resigned from my
full-time job at newegg it was like one
of the most difficult things I ever had
you know it's just like there's no
turning back at that point and you know
and you don't you just don't know what's
around the corner or if it's gonna
succeed or fail well you can do is try
but I feel like the fear of not knowing
you know if you really reach your
potential or you know explore that
possibility is almost worse than than
failing you know in some respects 2015
you got it you got to try new things
that's right that's right it's a modern
age we're all supposed to you know take
risks and you know it's we have the
internet on our side I think that's one
thing that people back then you know
couple generations ago didn't really
have we can we can make a living online
and it's like well I like being online
even when I'm not working so this seems
like the perfect job for me yeah don't
even to wear pants most of the time I'm
not moving to pants any right now
actually yeah so and neither are you I'm
sure ah you got me we'll do it we'll do
a full you know from the waist down tour
we'll save that for the end though
because people will stick around for
that um all right so what questions do
we got here and if you see any questions
in chat as well Matt feel free to fire
him off um let's see Oh someone a
fractal Josh asked how is the i Justine
book so far Matt oh well as you would
assume Josh still have not opened it but
I'm planning on it maybe otherwise it's
just gonna go sit with Steve like you
assumed so yeah that's gonna is it kind
of like a autobiography or a memoir type
thing or yeah yeah it's a memoir so it's
basically just how she got to where she
is today which is pretty cool cuz she's
pretty successful and she follows me on
Twitter so I also hit me up Justine you
know nice yeah right Matt single hey oh
yeah you know everyone in chat isn't
have disappointed but that's okay yeah
anyone in chat sorry you don't have a
chance against iJustine we all know who
Matt's going what else we got here um
let's see looks like someone was talking
about my mic flag yeah it has a logo on
it it's so beautiful isn't it where did
you get that that's really nice amazon
it's like eight dollars for the plastic
part
it and then I just printed my logo out
on photo paper nice I just taped it on
there cuz that's how ghetto I am but it
works hey it looks way less ghetto than
the setup that we have here's curse to
you for that it definitely adds kind of
like a more professional look like wow
that kinda he's doing oh he means
business making me will you got a flag
see the flag the deciding factor between
amateur and professional exactly yeah
okay what else we got here come on guys
fire off some questions oh I should be
checking my Twitter as well sometimes
people like to ask in Twitter do to do
so they said some people ask questions
that I'm just like I can't say that on
stream come on guys you know that's not
going to get get pushed it's like ninety
percent of them too how do you use your
camera as a webcam I mean technically
you just need you know video cable going
out if it supports it I I have a black
magic capture card in my stream bucks
that were running this whole shindig
with right now and I've got the
camcorder that Paul bought recently
specifically for the show it's just got
a mini HDMI two regular hdmi out going
into the back black magic card and OBS
pretty much takes care of the rest in
that arena so not too difficult I don't
see any like hard-hitting questions you
know life changing right right I don't
either come on guys you guys aren't
drunk enough yet to drop your
inhibitions and just ask us all the
random shits oh hey Matt from your
experience what is the best store to buy
a PC desk ooh um god I'm gonna get so
much hate for saying it ikea cuz where
else are you gonna do it um but honestly
i would also say you don't need to buy
it from you know like a store you can go
to like home depot and just get like a
granite countertop you know do it
yourself and make it work yep that's
very true probably save some save some
cash if you you do it yourself as well
exactly every money every dollar saved
building a desk is another dollar into
your PC which you know considering the
show's called pin my pc right now yeah
it's kind of a big deal exactly just
just don't leave your PC on the floor
whatever you do yeah oh yeah there's
there's some interesting pictures that
we're going to take a look at later
great oh yeah yeah i just recently put
mine up on my desk i have hardwood
floors anyway but i like it up on my
desk so yep safe and sound wet
headphones are those probably asking
both of us so Matt what do you got there
these are brain waves hm nine brain
waves I don't think I've heard of them
or I haven't had much experience with
them are they pretty good oh good oh
good there they're literally like the
the opposite um like the good version of
beats basically okay and I a lot cheaper
so it's good that's that's good I was
gonna ask I hopefully bit cheaper than
beets yeah they're like a hundred in
some box like not not bad at all so
they're they're cheaper than beets but
sound better which is like all
headphones yeah basically and it really
good build quality they kind of resemble
the beats i guess yeah definitely this
thing that compact are they pretty
comfortable as well oh yeah i could sit
here for like 13 hours straight sweet
cuz that's how long the stream is so
alright hopefully your put it to the
gentle yeah exactly I where'd some dt
880 pros from biodynamic
german-engineered open back design super
good studio headphones I use them for
editing gaming or they're really comfy
floor pads and stuff okay what else we
got here HTC vive or oculus cv1 I
actually don't know too much about
either of those I was gonna say the same
thing I'm like one of those awkward
things already we're getting no I i know
i know very briefly about them but i
haven't done enough research on them yet
to to give an opinion one way or the
other and you never want to do that you
never want to give your opinion on line
when you're not well informed cuz then
you just get it's a shitstorm of trolls
and and whores you could just pull a
matt philly and say both both just
confuse the out of them equal
opportunity I'm gonna I'm gonna go
devil's advocate and say neither Oh see
there you go they boil sides both what
are you in there both horrible okay
question Kyle what's your favorite
system you've built to date oh man
that's that's really tough actually
cuz do it thanks i built a lot um
favorite one I built ever man it's it's
really tough to beat your first it
really is just because there's that
whole dreaded dreading feeling of if
it'll work and I think that makes the
the moment when it finally turns on and
actually does work a lot more satisfying
because after that it's like you know
it's like riding a bike it's like well
no one's ever been like it was the 50 of
50 third time riding my bicycle that
really got to me now it's always like
your first time when you finally get it
I think that's at least the most
memorable and probably the most
impactful build that I've experienced
and life changing life changing life
changing um I would totally agree
considering I've only known one builds
up it's also the first build format as
well yes yeah that would make sense what
else we got here all right just a couple
more and then we'll move on to the good
stuff um don't know what that means I
guess something fun I can mention is
tomorrow I'm getting a nice package in
the morning and not okay whoa keeping it
on to hear Matt get a bj I'm getting a
delivery from UPS that's better Jesus
the UPS guy you're all over the place
buddy yeah um what is it though what
sounds getting too very nice brand new
displays so I'm getting rid of my triple
display setup 27 aoc displays and I'm
getting I haven't really said but let's
just say they're ultra wide and the
brand spankin new I'm getting two of
them you know pretty good that's pretty
hot are they are those gonna be your new
primary monitors I'm guessing yep yep
I'm actually uh being a really good
brother in giving all my three displays
to my little brother so you better
appreciate that wow you have a
brother he's like the luckiest brother
in the world yeah so yep he better be
happy all the other brothers in the
world are just getting their older
brothers socks and like oh yeah it's the
back of them anymore
yeah that's that's pretty awesome but
are you gonna be doing any video
coverage on those monitors we check him
out oh yeah tomorrow I should have a
video up of me just setting them up and
whatnot so stay tuned for that yeah it's
gonna be dope very cool says when you're
doing your unboxings and reviews how
many video recording devices do you have
filming from different views at the same
time I only do single camera I'm not
sure about Matt but I only have one
camera recording at the same time unless
I'm doing a build then sometimes I'll
have like two cameras set up I think
that most i've ever had was like three
but that was for a web series that i did
back in the day for system config but
usually it's just one I record one
section of a video at a time I do all my
teleprompter stuff talking to the camera
and then separately i'll record all the
sexy b-roll shots of the hardware and
things like that pretty much like it
should be done yeah that one I mean
you're like old professional you know
like it's just a matter of bandwidth to
like who's gonna be manning the other
campuses well you know for you and me
it's just that's it this is the entire
camera crew you know I can only press so
many things with so many hands yeah so
that's just what works I guess for now
you know that's me once we get to line
his status will have like an entire
camera crew hey awesome that works yeah
okay let's let's see oh this is a good
one for you Matt what was the one life
changing moment in your life that
started you down the road of being a
professional youtuber um I honestly I
always had to throw back to the barn
Cleese he found me and he's like put me
on your show and I was like okay like I
didn't even know who he was to be quite
honest um but I was like yeah and then
after that you know and then obviously
things like lioness and this guy Kyle
just threw me through the roof and ya
know it's just don't have that guy back
on again yeah took the words right out
he was like yeah but now I would just
say getting someone you know big like
Jerry to to kind of be someone that
believes in what I do so that's pretty
cool that's that's definitely got to be
pretty pretty damn Inc
urging I think oh yeah when someone like
so much bigger than you notice his
potential in what you're doing it's just
like whoa like it opens up doors and
makes you think like wow I can actually
do this if this guy who's already
successful thinks I can yeah then it's
definitely obtainable exactly plus he
just in his video yesterday was wearing
my shirt uh when he was painting and he
basically was talking smack he's like I
don't wanna get my good shirt sturdy so
i'm wearing my pit myself it's like
thank you in typical barnacle ease
fashion yeah exactly brilliant awesome i
actually didn't know that i actually
didn't know that he was like your first
big co-host or whatever for the show or
guest yeah that and that he contact
contacted you that's that's awesome yeah
it was very cool guy yeah totally and
let's see let's do one more question
format come on what about uh it's
actually just in general i didn't even
know this was a thing steam doing
refunds that a thing that real I I
briefly heard about this um I well the
last steam refund I heard was for the
mods like when people were paying for
mods when when steam tried to do the
whole paid mods thing people bought some
mods and I guess steam at some point so
that they were going to give people
refunds for the mods because they
realized paid mods were where a bad idea
I think that's pretty much the story but
interesting you know steam steam
definitely is one to listen to their
audience and they don't take what they
say lightly you know their their
business and they're trying to profit
like any other business but I think they
they understand that the only reason why
they're successful is because they've
been catering to their audience a
certain way and their voices are being
heard so uh yes good to me that's I'm
not too surprised that steam would would
be given refunds for like that for
something like that if they felt gamers
how to write gamers Nina were justified
in that cause true but that's super cool
alright cool thank you guys so much for
the questions we're going to shift gears
here and let's just start taking a look
at some of these pc's because we've got
quite a few of them to go if
were already about 20 minutes into the
show I'm going to try to keep it an hour
long just just to be respectful of
Matt's time and your guys's time it well
at home but let's just see how many we
get through here so first off let's go
to this one from Brandon Brandon sends
in his system which isn't a half X be
there it is right there sitting pretty
now we were just talking Matt we were
just talking about having a desk to put
your computer on and not putting it on
the floor at all costs Brandon's kind of
taken like a hybrid approach it's not
really on the floor but it's not on a
desk either he's got wooden pallets
under this system and I'm not sure if
that's where he keeps his system
regularly or if or if that's just where
it is you know you and I don't know why
he'd have pallets in his room maybe his
room is a warehouse great you're never
gonna find out but you know at the very
least it's not on the carpet I will say
that it might not be the prettiest thing
to look at but it is more functional
than than the damn carpet getting
sucking in all that dust and foot debris
oh I like to call it Phil debris don't
say it like that was wounded I know it's
supposed to ruin it it's supposed to
ruin it for everyone but let's take a
look at what he's got inside so under
the head we've got an air cooler here
looks like maybe a hyper 212 evo from
from coolermaster but he's definitely
put some slapped on some corsair fans
there which looked pretty nice it's kind
of hard to see here's a better picture a
top-down view so Matt like the way the
half XP I've never actually physically
built in one before but from my
understanding like half the components
are it's basically a cube it's a
cube-shaped case that the motherboard
mounts horizontally instead of
vertically and it's kind of got two
platforms over two floors if you will
it's like a two-story house so on the
top story you've got your motherboard
cpu and GPU and things like that and on
the bottom are the less attractive
components like your power supply hard
drives and things of that nature where
you can kind of keep most of your cables
so it's supposed to be a really good
case for cable management as well as
promote really healthy air flow as you
can see he's got to intake fans they're
off to the right but this is a
I mean I don't know I think there could
be some work done with the cable
management it kind of looks like you've
got a nice sound card there but I feel
like it's just kind of the cables
routing a little bit too far you
definitely want to cut down the visible
length of your cables if you can see
like a long distance long part of your
cable or a large chunkier cable it's
typically not favorable on the eyes and
in most cases these days I know
especially the fxb offer solutions
around that so you don't have to expose
so much of your cable there might be
another way that you can route it around
I can kind of see towards the bottom
there you might be able to shortcut it I
don't know if you know maybe you had to
take the long route or have to route it
to the right side because maybe your
cable wasn't long enough to route
underneath you know and we don't know
the full story here all we can do is
make judgments based on what we see from
the pictures but apart from that I think
you also would need to clean this system
yes it seems like i can see fingerprints
like on the on the motherboard the
motherboard panel or whatever the
motherboard tray i should say there's
fingerprints like made in the dust like
you know it's great for for crime scenes
if you want to like stop a burglar in
his tracks and you know get the dust of
fingerprints off or whatever but all
together it looks like you haven't
cleaned this thing in about six to eight
months possibly which i think is just
too long these days especially if you're
going to be using this thing everyday
which a lot of us are and that generates
a lot of dust you know i'm probably it's
half of the dust that came with those
two two wooden pallets is probably now
in your system so you have to make sure
to like get that stuff out every now and
then but apart from that I don't see
anything glaringly wrong with it other
than the cable management definitely I
think this think this is the eight pen
pci I don't know that's what is that I
think that's a cpu cable whether it's
the CPU cable or the 24-pin that could
be tucked away i think if you zip tie
that it just kind of looks like it's
flopping all over the place it looks
very loose and i understand that you
know it's it's on the first floor of the
case and it's not going to be visible
from from any other point of view unless
you were to take the actual and closure
off but just just you know for four
principles sake for tidiness I don't
know it feels good to know that all of
your cables are tucked away because even
even though no one else can tell it's
like one of those things we're like oh I
don't I don't care and people try to
reassure you like oh it's not a big deal
i don't mind and you're like I don't
even notice it you're like but I notice
it and that's the problem I don't care
if anyone else notice is it so it's kind
of one of those things here's a shot of
it lit up in the dark which looks really
nice I definitely like how he's matched
his fans together you know what I mean I
think that that kind of makes a more
cohesive theme to it a bit of a color
scheme there I can't tell if they're
blue I think they're blue in this
picture they look completely purple but
based on the fact that he's got a blue
I'm sorry a motherboard with like blue
heat sinks and stuff i'm guessing that
they're they're blue LED fans but all
together pretty nice build did you have
anything else to say about this one Matt
I honestly just think that it's a
badass-looking case like I really really
like that it's so different and that's
to me someone that likes the look of you
know everything not even inside but
outside that looks great in a setup and
yeah it's just it's really dusty
especially the outside of the case it's
killing me yeah yeah there's definitely
something to be said about dust in the
case that has such good airflow too
because it's bringing so much air in
constantly especially he's got I think
that's probably a 200 millimeter fan up
there at the top which you know that's
that's pulling a lot of stuff anything
that you know gets tossed off of the
left side of your desk probably falls
right into there and yeah go ahead and
clean that sucker definitely manage them
cables and you should be good to go so
thanks for setting that in Brandon next
up we've got something from something
weird I'm not making the joke or
anything that says his twitter handle is
something we are going to start off
exactly but his system doesn't look too
weird it actually looks pretty decent he
definitely has some good robust hardware
in there he's got to win forest cards
those might be um I don't know what
those are seven 80s maybe I'm not too
sure but he's got him an SLI looks
pretty solid again
with the dustiness there's just too much
dust in this system that that leads me
to believe it's been way too long since
you last cleaned it I think I think you
again you've got a lot of air cooling in
here I think those are 2 1 40 millimeter
fans at the front and this is this is an
air too I'm sorry an air 540 case I
think just just because you know you
notice Matt how you don't see like a
power supply yeah I was going to say I
think it's because it's on the other
side so you kind of like after seeing so
many cases you realize like most cases
are just like that you could they can be
categorized in certain genres or you
know class classes or whatever and this
is almost kind of like if you think
about like the half xb but on its side
we've got you know the second floor it's
just a house that has now been turned on
its side and you've got a vertically
mounted motherboard but still all your
Messier components are in the back which
you would think leads to clean our cable
management and for the most part this is
definitely better cable management than
we saw in the last system I think
certain things stand out to me more than
others like like the I think that's an
8-pin think you're 8-pin pcie I'm so I
keep saying saying pcie but you're a pen
cpu connector up there on the top right
is just it just looks a little I don't
know how it's a little out of place how
it's crossing over the RAM there if you
could maybe tuck that away a little bit
better also i like how kind of blacked
out this thing is it looks very like
simple and minimalistic again if you
clean it up and shine it up it'll look
way like a million times better but I
think maybe those pcie cables that are
going into your video cards are kind of
throwing me off a little bit just
because of the red connectors I feel
like that those red accents kind of
demand a little bit more red in the
system yo for example if you maybe had
like some some of those corsair airflow
fans that have like the interchangeable
rings on them that you know they can be
either be switched to blue or red if you
had some fans like that just give it a
little bit more accent I think to to
match those pcie connectors that would
be pretty sweet or you can just get some
extensions like some nice black sleeved
extensions
from silverstone orbit phoenix or
something like that or sleeping yourself
and swap him out for those stock flat
flat cables with with the red connectors
and just make it all black black it out
yeah I agree cuz the the red is like
like why why is there like a theme cuz i
don't know maybe does he have lights
that we don't see cuz you know he's only
gave us one photo there's not much to go
off of but it's so out of place normally
you know you see too much of a color
where it's like whoa that's overwhelming
but this is like it's just it's out of
place so i would definitely decide are
you going all black are you gonna had
some read into it so yeah i agree yep
definitely but altogether nice looking
system something weird i still that i
still liked that name is weird yeah now
I see why he did it there you go that's
his name thank you for setting that in
though next up we've got Anthony Anthony
sending in his his r9 290x system he's
got an AMD 8350 corvy 51 this is a
pretty nice-looking system first off we
can take a look at what it looks like in
the dark with all the lights on so we
know here that he definitely does have
some red LEDs going yeah and so we kind
of know like what kind of thing he's
going for now the other one should have
been if you have that read it you know
even with the lights off you could see
the red kind of flows through the whole
pc right exactly I'm not Beth maybe
that's maybe something I should start
doing like having people sending not
just pictures of their rigs in the
daylight but also maybe a shot of it at
night or a dimly lit environment if they
do have things like LEDs because that
might change you know what what Paul or
I or you might say about it when we're
not giving suggestions and things like
that but altogether this looks nice in
the dim and the dimness of the night but
here let's take a look at a brighter
picture can definitely kind of see a bit
more here I like how you've gone the
extra mile and sleeved your own cables
I'm pretty sure that that's a that's
self self done they don't look like you
bought them anywhere because they're
they're actually different the the red
striping in the PCIe cables is a bit
different than the ATX cable on the side
there so I think you did that yourself
so kudos to you that's definitely
it's definitely a tall order to just
leave your own cables like that so a
good effort there looks like you've got
enough room in your case it doesn't look
like anything's competing for space at
this point I see a couple hard drives
there in your cages on the bottom cage
anyway the top cage I don't see any
drives in it maybe there's an SSD or
something but it just kind of looks like
your housing more cables in there and if
that's the case maybe try to route those
behind the motherboard tray that's
that's a pretty big substantial looking
case I think you'll probably have some
extra room for cables back there but
again Oh a lot of these boiled down to
cable management and Matt this is
probably something that I know this is
something that you deal with a lot on
the channel even though you don't work
with pcs directly you're still
constantly talking about cable
management when it comes to people's
monitors and keyboards and mice and and
computers as well and it's just amazing
like how much of a difference that that
alone makes it changes everything I've
been imagined this picture with bad
cable management I mean it it's really
not that bad in this uh this pc at all
um but just imagine with it like all
over the place it kills it but when it's
old nice and clean and it's got that
nice accent lighting in the red all over
it just makes it look like that's hot
that's like you know that's they're
gonna put that on their website you know
selling the case exactly nice it is yeah
exactly yep very nice so all in all I
don't have too much to say if you really
wanted to get nitpicky about it um what
you could do is and this is one thing
that I like it's so nitpicky but it's
one thing that I like is a pet peeve of
mine with course air coolers is their
corsair link cable which is this little
cable off to the left sticking out of
the water block there it just it just
adds another cable is the really the
problem that I have with it and usually
it's located like on the side I wish
that corsair would actually put the port
right next to the fan ports so that you
could sleeve them all together and kind
of bind them but they don't it's off to
the side i'm sure there's engineering
reasons behind that and that's fine so
what we what i would do as a builder if
i was really being picky or whatever and
being super precise azide probably route
this the corsair link cable over to the
two fan cables you have there and just
zip tie them together so what
looks like one slightly thicker cable
instead of two separate cables going in
different directions I think that will
really make it look a bit a bit tidier
overall and you know it's it's the cpu
it's like the main thing that people
look at it's one of the first things
that people look at when they look into
your side panel window so try to keep
that as clean as possible if you can but
I do like this the setup here I like how
you have a bottom mounted fan just
pointed straight at your video card
right at the bottom of the case very
thoughtful and apart from that Oh other
thing I caught is I would probably swap
out that optical drive and the top right
for a black one Paul and I were kind of
talking about this on a previous show we
were like yeah well I don't know why all
the optical drives are beige and then
someone in chat reminded us that they do
have black ones i think asus has a black
one and then i was like oh duh i have
one of those it's just been forever
since i actually had to use it obviously
but they do have black ones and they're
dirt cheap i mean even if you get a blu
ray one you can probably get it for 40
50 bucks just swap that out the beige
honestly is the only thing that clashes
drastically with with this set oh and um
so yeah Bo than that nice job Anthony
well done well played sir all right next
up we got Michael and this is Michael
system I think he might have sent this
in now I look at it this might be a
repeat but I think he's made some
improvements since then particularly in
cable management let's take a look here
definitely has a strong theme going I
like the blue theme obviously he's got
two cards in sli and they're not
matching ones a reference design cooler
on the bottom and the one on top is a
think it's EVGA or they could see vga or
XFX i'm not sure but I I think I
remember him telling us that he got the
the reference card on sale like a killer
deal it was either a 780 or 780 ti or
something and he just couldn't say no
and I would've done the same thing if
you get a really good deal it doesn't
matter what it looks like just buy the
damn thing you're getting a steal but I
don't know if there's any way that you
could possibly get
that same cooler that you have on the
top card maybe buy it after market from
the manufacturer and install it on the
reference card because that would look a
lot better I mean just functionally this
is this blows my computer out of the
water chances are but if you're talking
about pimping can't have no mismatching
cards now I'm saying yeah seriously what
got a match that up but um yeah that's
probably easier said than done but you
know yeah depends oh he also he made a
good point cuz he said he should
probably get a new case cuz yes that's
the first thing when I look at that I'm
like wow good job fitting all that yeah
exactly the clown car you know yes it is
it is and there's this to me clowns in
it I think that that definitely is true
like there's in this system it looks
like the components are competing for
space it really looks like they they
might be starved for a bit of air flow
because they're all so close to each
other even whatever air flow they do get
is probably just more hot air because of
the other component that's sitting right
next to it is warming up the ambient
temperatures inside the case or the in
case temperatures so yeah a 780ti I mean
that's that's like the polar opposite of
this case seven ATT is huge I mean you
can go eatx and it still looks like a
mini ITX board in comparison it's just
so cavernous but it's a great case and
offers really great cooling as well and
just oodles and oodles of water cooling
support and things like that but I think
that's exactly what what Michael needs
is he needs a bigger case because he's
got a lot of hardware he's taking full
advantage of his pc he's got for hard
drives in there on SSD to two video
cards and and i'm sure he'd like to slap
on possibly a larger radiator in there
as well maybe even do some custom water
cooling but yeah kudos on on being able
to fit all that stuff in there and still
get some really nice cable management
out of it as well i think it's super
clean I like how he's tactfully tied the
unused PCIe connectors kind of
underneath the cables so they're kind of
like pointed off to the left and they're
all facing the same way it just looks
really tidy it does
Stefan and I even liked the attention to
detail with the the two blue fan
connector the sleeved fan connectors
right right above the power supply going
off over there see that's how small this
case is he doesn't even have any
grommets underneath the motherboard to
slide those and he's got to go all the
way over to the main grommet for the
power supply to to hide those cables
anywhere but yeah great attention to
detail has even got a blue SATA
connector save it save the cable back
there as well I'm digging it I'm digging
it just get a bigger case try to get a
you know try to match those video cards
somehow I don't know how you're gonna do
it but just try just try a damn it and
possibly even get a you know a custom
decal over your power supply to cover
the red ax because it's a clashing a
little bit but you know or if you get a
case that you know a lot of cases these
days we'll have a shroud that covers the
power supply so you don't see it at all
it's you know something that like
companies like NZXT like to do because
like power supplies are always stealing
the show just we'll just cover the whole
thing and slap an NZXT logo on top of it
that's how mine is but mine mine is just
stealth it's odd that the fantex it is
the lux I think yeah um Here I am
looking like a new because I don't even
know the name of the case but that's so
it looks so nice yeah like hiding that
because cable management wise it's
amazing it looks like a crap down there
but you don't even know that so it's
great I like it hello like yeah oh also
the other thing I was gonna say you
should have people say the name of their
pc you know how like people know that's
a good idea because I want to know
looking at this build what did he call
this cuz I'm thinking clown car but I
don't know like I'm wondering what what
people call their systems I think that's
something people should start doing see
Matt this is this is exactly why I
copied your show is you have great ideas
and I'm starved for them so i'm just
going to plagiarize everything you do uh
but yeah cool uh yeah let's thank you
Michael for the clown car I really love
it just work on those few things and you
should be good to go let's move on to
the next one and let's let's just try to
make up names for these pcs from now on
oh I like that yeah good let's do it
will make him up for them for this round
since that
provided any this is from Ed from
sapphire sapphire ed some of you may
know him on Twitter he's a he's a vendor
rep for sapphire the actual company the
actual GPU video card manufacturer I
shouldn't say GPU but video card board
partner and Sapphire make some really
great cards of course his system is
rocking a sapphire vapor-x hello God
yeah it's a 290x um feel free to send me
a sample ahead if I tell you your system
is perfect is does that increase my odds
of getting a sample to 90 x over 3 90 x
with that XD give me a Fiji card but
this is a pretty nice setup I think this
is in arc midi i want to say it's a
fractal our committee case based on the
feet looks a little bit smaller than
fine define r4 to find our 50 yeah it's
definitely an arc midi because i can
tell from the front panel but a beefy
beefy video card in there which I like
very healthy air flow because it's
completely unemployed you got both drive
cages removed there are no drive cages
so you probably got them in the back
somewhere I think I think he might have
mentioned that they were SSDs which
makes a lot of sense because I don't
know how you'd fit two three and a
half's back there but you can see that
he's prioritized airflow over storage
here and I think that that that works
that's a good solution you know not
everyone's gonna be able to do that
because they're gonna they're gonna need
more storage but ed doesn't apparently
need it so much he's prioritizing
airflow for that 290x as well as the
other components in the system and he
said his card runs pretty damn cool like
it doesn't get above 68 Celsius which is
awesome also a testament to the the
sapphire cooler in there but I believe
those are cougar fans as well very good
airflow and static pressure but I'd say
the only thing here because your cable
management is spot-on ed like everyone
take a lesson from Ed's cable management
even like if you look at the front the
two front fans you can see like the
cabling
like the cables meet at the bottom
corner of Lucy and they just go and like
I didn't even notice it you know they
have to really look at you gotta try to
find it it's like I spy I spy cables and
edson computer one game takes forever so
yeah I think it looks really really nice
the only thing I would have to say is
color coordination yep and I know this
isn't this isn't a big deal for some
people but it is for me personally I
think you know manufacturer is now more
than ever of almost every component go
the extra mile to have their components
colored differently you know offered in
different colors for that reason because
customization has become such a huge
thing personalization it is a personal
computer after all and I think it really
ties everything together when you have a
cohesive color scheme for all for your
entire system but you know I think it's
very functional this is definitely a
very functional epact rig here that
you've got and I know it probably
performs really well what about you Matt
what else would you say about this
system well first of all I'm just
laughing at all the different things
people are saying about the motherboard
color but ed is saying that it's uh the
flash made it look like that it's
actually black which makes me feel a lot
better oh that was like really throwing
it all for me yep you know I didn't mind
like all the clashing colors cuz
whatever but when I saw the motherboard
I was like that looks like it you know
that you read the comments it's pretty
good um but yeah I mean that the colors
at the end of the day if you really like
nitpicking I mean it's really it's like
a rainbow in there so i would definitely
figure that out and I don't like the
wait is this windowed I don't know is it
a week see it's got a tinted window on
it okay so can you see the power supply
from that or is it the way it's cut I
believe the windows a little bit above
it you'd have to like be like right
really close I'm looking down to really
see it alright yeah cuz the power supply
with that label they're just throwing up
but if you can't see it then I guess
it's really not an issue at all so yep
yeah I mean cable management's like 10
out of 10
really nice exactly uh I would
definitely agree um the last critique I
would say is and you know kind of
repeating ourselves here but ed blends
last time you cleaned your system I can
see those fans are getting some build-up
right there which is a good sign it
means you love your system and that you
have been using it frequently I can also
see that you used a cloth or your finger
to wipe off whatever dust was on the
power supply because I can see like a
clean line that was just it just been
wiped that that top layer but but yeah I
mean it all together a really solid
system ad which looks really nice and
thank you for officially agreeing to
send me and 290x everyone everyone heard
it right right here on stream I heard it
yeah matter if your package yep there
you go I have a witness alright cool so
let's move on to Simon thanks for that
ad Simon's got his budget build here all
it says is my budget build and thank you
for letting us know that this is in fact
a budget build and it looks like you've
definitely done a lot here for for a
budget system you've got an SSD in there
which i think is great if you're able to
get something that is super affordable
that you think is a budget build and
still throw an SSD and I think that's
awesome again we've got a sapphire card
here not not quite the vapor x cooler
that we saw on beefs I'm piece on edge
safety card unbe start extra say that in
Viva and we've officially lost all
control um Jesus Christ but yeah moving
back to the system this what were you
saying kindly don't know I can't even
think straight anymore Oh God someone
help me uh but III think cable
management again you know it's probably
tough because I can tell this is a
budget case for sure you can tell it's
just maybe a little bit on the cheaper
side like cheap cheaply made or I Gary
the Jag they're just now see
oh but the microwave friends I get I
think we've just invented a meme oh no
all right I'm minimizing Chad this is
not yet i was gonna say yeah he will not
be able to do the show hey I'm
struggling at Liz all right focus whoo
focus and take a sip here everyone take
a moment everyone taking oh man what a
silence mmm Center your cheek yeah there
you go bring it back down how's it going
ladies and gentle alright so moving back
to this system as I was saying it's a
cheaper case and typically with cheaper
cases they don't give you much leeway in
terms of cable management they give you
really small space behind that
motherboard tray Matt you were super
privileged to build in the enthu looks
amazing case for cable management I mean
you'll see a damn thing if you don't
want to not so much the case with these
budgets budget Chessie's you know he
probably paid 40 60 bucks for this guy
so he's probably got I want to say like
half an inch to you know down to five
millimeters of space back there and you
really gotta you really gotta you know
it's it's a valiant effort to to get all
the cables hidden in cases like this but
um you've also got some interesting
stuff here this this layout calls for a
top-mounted power supply as opposed to a
bottom mounted 1 i'm not sure if there's
ventilation at the top of your case
there if there is i might flip the the
power supply 180 degrees just to have
the ventilation in taking fresh air from
outside instead of sucking up hot air
from inside your case as it runs through
your the componentry of your power
supply it might just be a bit healthier
overall but like i said it's it's a
budget case so you might not have much
to work with there might not be
ventilation holes at the top there you
could do some modding I mean as a fun
project you know it depends how much
effort you want to put in you probably
see a really small return for the amount
of work that you put in but you know if
you're kind of into that DIY you know
adding scene or whatever you want to try
something new might be something cool to
do other than that you know I can't I
can't knock you too hard for the cable
management cuz I know the type of chess
chassis your building and I've built in
you know several of them before and I
know it's difficult I think here you're
also I don't think you I also don't
think you mind color coordination much
it doesn't look like you care too much
about it i know i think there's leds in
there you got some blue leds in the case
so clearly you're leaning towards blue
of all the things of all the colors but
you've also got knocked to offends in
there which by the way don't don't take
them out I would never remove a knock to
a fan for aesthetics purpose the first
etic purposes they're hideous don't get
me wrong i think there's very few
systems out there we're not to a fan on
that's not been modded or modified in
any way looks good with with the rest of
the build but that being said maybe you
could spray paint the frames or and the
blades if you really wanted to give it a
you know an overall blue or black theme
um I also think it's kind of funny did
you notice Matt that he's got two
different colored gems in there like his
memory oh yeah there's a blue one and a
black one I've got a name for the system
black and blue Wow didn't see that one
coming yeah right yeah or or my second
choice was Rihanna Rihanna Rio after you
know yeah chris brown rihanna ik soon it
was a while here so it'll always be to
you soon yeah everyone go tweet that to
Rihanna oh okay mega relive the past oh
boy what have we done like Rihanna
though that's a good that's a good name
for it so right that should stick yeah I
like it might need to might have put I
need to put a few dents there in the
cinema side panel just just to bring out
the theme you know like to mod it you
got to make it worthy of the name yeah
this pc the i guess i'll get back on
topic for you yeah it's like you said i
never built in anything like this so i
don't know how
that it is but yeah it's like criss
cross and it but then again I'm sure
you're reaching you're really struggling
to get it to where it needs to go so I
can only imagine what that's like um I
don't know I is there really anything
you could do in the bottom cuz it's just
so open and empty or is it I mean I
guess it's good for air flow but yeah I
mean if not there's really nothing down
there other than that SSD so right i
mean it almost looks like because
they're so like there's basically
nothing in the bottom and he's got the
power supply on top it looks very top
heavy things there any mean like it
looks like if they were to like if there
was a marginal earthquake or something
that it could easily you know it just
looks really top heavy and i don't know
what you could really do about that it's
just awkward it's very weird it's gonna
be a bit difficult like feeling awkward
when you're you know hauling it from A
to B or whatever picking it up and
things like that but I don't know what
you could really do to to solve that
problem in this case I mean I think
that's just one of the sacrifices you
make for you know buying a really cheap
case and saving a bunch of money on the
bright side if you do have like a fan
mount at the front because chances are
maybe this this case only came with like
one exhaust fan or no intakes at the
front slap a fan on there if you haven't
already and just drive some more air
flow to your video card that's all I
could say and I was also kind of curious
too because you know you see a cpu
cooler he's got that neck knocked to a
fan that tan knocked to a fan to the
left usually i would suggest putting it
to the right of the cooler and blowing
the hot air towards the rear of the case
so that that that rear fan can exhaust
the hot air coming off your heat sink
there but i think in this case it looks
like he probably didn't have room for it
on the right on the right side I think
his he's probably run into some ram
clearance issues if you were to try to
install that fan on the right all I all
I have to say is I hope that fan that's
attached to your cpu cooler is set to
pull and not push every all the airflow
should be going the same direction so it
should be pushing or I'm sorry pulling
air to the back of your case exiting out
that rear knock to a fan that you've got
there and you should be good to go
but Simon a lovely budget build perhaps
one day you can you know that's the
beauty of PCs you start with a budget
build or something really low-key and
you can work your way up you know start
installing component after component
over the years over several months or
whatever eventually get a nicer case and
your your cables will look a hell of a
lot better because of it so thank you
sir yeah appreciate it and moving on to
Dylan every start I'm still scared to
look at the chat I mean it's calmed down
a bit okay good that's good okay good
you guys are you guys are terrible by
the way you're just trying to sabotage
the whole stream don't you know that
Matt and I will self sabotage the stream
without your help exactly sorry that's
that's the only reason why I came on
here that's what I'm looking to do oh
yeah you're here to revive me to pull me
out of my dark place when like that
happens I need an anchor Matt be my
anger you're actually my sponsor yeah
exactly for AAA ok topic here this is
from Dillon Dillon thank you for sending
in the system it's a custom water-cooled
rig you've got a lot going on here and I
I'll be honest I'm gonna level with you
guys I've never built a custom
water-cooled system myself from the
ground up I've helped people build their
systems and you know I've done things
like mounting mounting certain
components and installing things but
I've never done the full thing myself
from start to finish so when it comes to
custom water-cooled builds I always feel
like I don't I'm not like you know in
the right I don't have the authority to
really comment too much on it but I can
give my general opinions based on looks
and the very little you know the brief
knowledge of what I do have dunno about
it so again if we're if we're talking
aesthetics I just said this the noctua
fans don't look good in in ninety-nine
percent of the cases or the systems i've
seen they just don't that said they are
amazing fans and they perform better
than than most fans out there grant
albeit for for a premium price
but um I think I think you can you can
do a lot here the one thing that stands
out to me well i guess i guess i should
finish what I was saying about the fans
again spray paint them or yeah that's
that's pretty much all i would do
spray-paint them or make the rest of
your system the color of the noctua fan
so I make the rest of your components
beige like if they do that like because
it's just no one has a bill of that that
matches that color see you know right no
I don't think anyone's got a system
that's like let's let's do desert camo
what yes I've never seen worse colors
yeah do it do a desert camo mod that's
that's my solution Dylan someone's gonna
end up doing it now I know yeah desert
desert mod with with noctua fans it's
the only thing that'll look good um I
don't know spray paint your radiator
beige oh my god what do you want from me
um okay here's here's maybe one more
serious piece of advice is I I would
probably go with a solid color fluid for
your loop because I think when it's
clear it just it tends to look murky or
cloudy over time um and some people
might not mind that but I personally
just it feels dirty to me or feels you
know like like you should it should be
replaced doesn't look fresh you look
fresh so maybe I don't know get some
beige fluid get some brown fluid you
could call it oh you could call it the
plumber or so gonna say you know you
need to go buy it fluid you could do no
figure that I so I'll just hey I don't
know that's not a budget build but the
last guy if he looks to do some water
cooling you know just go to steal your
own feces liquefy it and drop it into
that bad boy yeah you could do that
pretty quick to the plumber yeah yeah go
go ahead leave you leave your guys's
best names for these pcs in the chat
yeah I want to see what people have to
say about this no the septic tank there
you go there you go that's a good one
nice said that that was ad no I'm sorry
good job beef
me and beef got ed I know the best
mistake that's the thing ever like call
someone beat by how would I even make
that mystique see they could be taking
so many different ways like before like
beef you know like uh wait here I'll get
you back on track I do agree about the
it looks cloudy with the chance of beef
balls you know you never doubt so it
does look a little like especially it
just looks gross I don't know I don't
know what's wrong with it yeah these
girls I don't know anything about water
cooling so no I I agree and maybe some
of it is attributed to the flash of the
camera I know flash tends to do weird
things um but I have known you know that
this is a problem with a clear fluid and
clear tubing and I I would have to guess
that changing the fluid is much easier
at this point then swapping out all of
your tubing that seems like a total
hassle and you know a full day project
so i don't know maybe just drain the
whole thing swap it out with some some
solid fluid and then also maybe replace
those dims the memory modules may be
with with some black ones because you've
you know you've you made the effort to
get some blacks leaving in there and it
does look it does look quite nice i like
how the power supply think you've
recolored it possibly to match the not
to a fan so it shows me you're trying
you want to make this work you want your
conforming your system to the noctua fan
color and i think that's awesome because
probably not many people actually or
have to have the balls to take on that
challenge yeah yeah so do it make it
work do it son Thank You Dylan
appreciate it brother by the way it is
630 it's been an hour so i am going to
we're gonna do two more of these you
cool with that Matt I'm I'm down you're
down all right yeah just I don't want to
go too crazy on you guys people start
getting cranky because it's like
midnight somewhere else or three
everything yeah so we'll wrap up these
last two say some closing words and then
then we'll be out so the
ones from one lon thank you presenting
this in this is his heir to 40 from
corsair that's the case and he said he
tried his best to tidy it up and it does
look very tidy actually yeah this the
hmm I might not have too much to say
about this again with the the Corsair
link cable coming out the the left side
of your water block you kind of this is
a better picture to show you what I mean
it just adds another cable that's going
you know different way so if you could
route that over to the fan cable that's
coming out of the top of your water
block right there and maybe even tuck it
underneath you know just zip tie are
really tight you know you can get some
really thin zip ties that are very
discreet black obviously would work work
nicely and just get that sucker out of
the way um but all together this is kind
of cool i think maybe also if i'm
getting you know nitpicky here you've
got some red pcie cables but you've got
a black HDX cable I would say either do
black and black or red and red and I'm
going to suggest red and red because
you've got red dims already and which
looks sick which looks really nice
however Matt do you notice anything
about this system that that we thought
about that we noticed with ed system we
were actually wrong about ed system on
this on this presumption but it might be
the case for this one they make me look
dumb ah something with the PCB possibly
word it looks brown the piece of the
motherboard looks Brown I don't think
that's cuz a flash to or that's a good
question I don't see the model number I
don't see those look like cocoa butter
yeah please in the shop looks black the
top does look black so I'm saying it
looks black at the top and they kinda
it's like a gradient almost guys in chat
let us know if this is a poopoo board or
if it's a black he isn't chad right now
okay said that he tried to bend that
cable and
doesn't it doesn't want to be bent
doesn't want to be bent yeah like no
Kyle get over it yeah yeah I know right
yeah you should keep of course in
linking their it um okay so he's
saying people are saying that it's
possibly black leather okay so it's just
the flash see you next time when you
guys send in your pictures I want you to
buy like a two-hundred-dollar lighting
kit make sure that shit's lit properly
all right oh no camera phone yeah
get some expensive ass lights when you
send in your tweets because it's worth
it all together though one this is a
nice looking system and it looks I don't
know if you cleaned it right before you
took the shot I'm sure a lot of people
do that but if not kudos to you for
keeping a really clean-looking system I
don't see a speck of dust on there if
you had the lighting kit I'd be able to
see if there was this but I'll let that
one slide because your cable
management's on point next week though
next week next week we shall see all
right thanks I agree yeah it's nice yeah
well done sir and last but not least
this one's from moshe he says he was
planning on replacing the orange fan and
yes he hasn't cleaned in months okay so
he's just told us from the get-go look I
know this thing is dirty as hell that's
okay I'm glad that you were up front
with us so we didn't have to speculate
or whatever and it looks like we've got
another arc midi case here from fractal
awesome cases we tend to see a lot of
fractal cases on the show just because
they're awesome they're really
well-built functionally have good air
flow their silent and they're pretty
damn affordable as well so I'm not
surprised we see so many of them on here
but this one looks like he's removed the
top drive cage opened up the airflow
that top fan there I think that's a
smart move just taking advantage of all
the airflow also I I mean what color is
that motherboard I'd like that one I
don't know because there's no gradient
effect on that one for me right right
yeah just poo poo basic just poo all
around you got ya whoo board my friend
which wouldn't surprise me because I
mean looking at all the dust he might
like it dirty you know that's a good
point I mean look at that SSD uh I just
kind of like want to put my finger over
and see how much dust comes up it's kind
of satisfying I'm not gonna lie when you
just like sing a little bit and it's
nice and clean that's probably what he
did right after he took the pictures i
can now it's just than you think yeah
sweat feeling good drawing images this
is my favorite oh yeah or the extreme
opposite of a smiley face I don't know
sometimes two and two go hand in hand
but uh what else do you have to say
getting us back on track here we have to
say about the sister nude well some
people are saying it's a poo poo board
um and I only saw one person say it's
black so I mean overall I wouldn't be
surprised if was boohoo like I said it's
it's a it's nice i there's really i
would really just want to see it nice
and clean just wipe it off clean it up
um I mean a little clash of colors but
there's really nothing too dominant for
me to be like why did you just follow
through with that so it's just a looks
like a nice you know build with random
parts basically yeah yeah I agree um it
also kind of looks like he might have a
micro ATX board in there that's a that's
a full ATX chassis but he might be a
micro ATX bored so I think that's the
only reason why the like all of this I
owe is like all of his front panel
connectors at the bottom of his
motherboard have to reach such a far
distance to get into those grommets is
because it's a smaller board then the
case was potentially intended for but
that's okay again yeah I think cleaning
it up would be good also that looks like
a gtx 980 in there but you know what it
might be a 960 as well all i'm going to
say is if it does happen to be based on
the other components how they look
pretty budget especially the power
supply i'm going to guess it's a 960 and
if that's the case solid well done if
it's a 980 i think you might need to be
careful on that power supply just make
sure that you if you're overclocking i
would definitely get a higher rated
power supply at least a 500
at the very least and that doesn't even
factor into what your CPU might be and
if you're overclocking on that as well
just want to make sure that you know no
one blows out there their hardware and
catches on fire although that would be
an awesome picture for free show just a
melted week half-melted says to it you
never know you never know what you're
gonna get I'm sure you actually i'm sure
you've gotten some pretty ridiculous
pictures of setups yeah like since you
started the show right disgusting like
literally to the point where you know
even the guy told me yeah that that uh
that plate on the floor under my desk
has been there for about six months and
i just didn't feel like picking it up
Mike well at least you let me know and
now I know so thank you disgusting wow
that's that's not even pimping at that
point that's just like offering general
help yeah it's like Annie Consuela from
freakin family got to come in and just
clean it up you know it's like okay oh
man that's that's pretty gnarly but
luckily we didn't have any any instances
of that like like you said there's
always next week who knows what kind of
Horrors we might find a clue in these
pc's I'm just waiting for like a like a
like someone's finger like just a
decapitated finger and one of them I god
oh no it's been there for months nothing
would mine that's the funny part it's
Rihanna's Chris Brown they got back
together alright that's that's our cue
to uh to wind things down here again
Moshe thank you for sending that in and
thank you to all of you other guys who
sent pictures in there was probably
