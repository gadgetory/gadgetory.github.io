click the link in the description for
more info what's up gasps so this is my
first review since returning home from
Computex in Taiwan and may I just say it
is so nice to be talking to you from an
air-conditioned room in the United
States despite the country's primary
election results thus far this video
also marks my first review of invidious
new gtx 1070 specifically the gaming x
8g model from the nice people over at
msi by now we're all aware of the gtx
1080s processing prowess but if you
don't have the six or seven hundred
bones to shell out 14 greens flagship
card the gtx 1070 is still really fast
but stays competitively priced with an
MSRP of 380 bucks for a custom model
like the gaming X or 450 dollars for the
reference Founders edition and as we'll
see in the benchmarks the price to
performance here positions the 1070 as
an attractive sweet spot for mainstream
gamers running 1080 or 1440 displays of
course GPUs rocking invidious Pascal
architecture will also have access to
new exclusive technologies such as SMP
GPU boost 3.0 and ansel check out my GT
X 1080 review if you want more deets on
those technologies now if you're
watching this video the first round of
1070 offerings have already hit the
market and are now available for
purchase although if this is news to you
they're probably all sold out by now so
for those of you who missed your first
chance
to snag one of these suckers perhaps
you'll find some solace by living
vicariously through me as we conduct to
this review out of the box MSI has
dialed in a factory overclock about 100
megahertz higher than reference speeds
with an alleged boost clock of 1797
megahertz
however without any tweaking GPU boost
took the card to just a hair shy of two
gigahertz which needless to say
impressed me more than a dead wifey
sauce the 1070 uses the same GP 104 GPU
as the GTX 1080 but it's been cut down a
bit with fewer cuda cores and eight gigs
of gddr5 memory as opposed to gddr5 X
being the slower card also brings the
TDP down to just 150 watts and that goes
for both the reference 1070 and today's
aftermarket version according to the
manufacturer's website with the arrival
of Pascal MSI has also rolled out their
latest twin frozer 6 cooler which in
theory should provide improved acoustics
and thermals over the last generation
the cooler features a newly patented
Torx 2.0 fan technology that generates
22% more air flow using steeper curved
blades and the power of teamwork now
that's cute and all but when will we be
able to hit aggressive overclocks using
good deeds like we've seen in the past
the 100 millimeter fans only spin up
once the GPU hits 60 degrees Celsius
promoting silent operation under light
workloads the open shroud rests above
the heatsink and heat pipes and uses a
slightly different mold from what we've
seen the last generation sticking with a
red and black colour scheme but adding a
more textured surface this time around
with some red LED accents
there's also a familiar RGB LED backlit
logo at the front and both lighting
regions can be disabled or independently
configured to display different effects
within the MSI gaming app while I do
like the aesthetic of this card it would
be nice to see a color neutral cooler
from MSI with full RGB LEDs to improve
color compatibility with any system
built I'm just saying this card seems a
little racist for additional power
delivery and OC stability a 6-pin pci ii
connector has been added to the
reference 8 pin plug indicating a custom
PCB on this card which is reinforced by
a sleek metal backplate display io stays
true to reference spec with one dual
link DVI three DisplayPort 1.4 and one
HDMI 2.0 B for testing I ran the card at
its factory overclock speed and rent it
once again after pushing it manually to
see just how much juice we could squeeze
out of the
down GP 104 after some quick tuning our
gtx 1070 hit 20 151 megahertz and stayed
at a reasonable 70 degrees Celsius
throughout our tests eating up just over
six gigs of VRAM it didn't seem long ago
when an 8 gig frame buffer was
considered total overkill so it's nice
to see games utilizing more memory as
the capacity increases with each
generation I'm also happy to report that
the twin frozer 6 stays very quiet under
load and here's a quick sound test to
back it up
all applications were run on my x99
testbed with a 59 60 X at 4,400
megahertz and 16 gigs of DDR 4 on
Windows 10 using the latest drivers
games were tested at 1080 1440 and 4k on
that note I will finally shut the hell
up for a minute so we can see how the
gtx 1070 stacks up with a look at the
benchmarks
I
so there you guys have it pretty
impressive numbers all around what we
can gather from these results is that
the GTX 10 seventies performance is
positioned somewhere between the 980ti
and the GTX 1080 which is an incredible
feat considering the 1070 is launching
at 58 percent of the price of the 980 T
is original MSRP obviously the struggle
is real at 4k but max settings at 1440
and below is a walk in the park the
overclocking results here were a tad
lackluster though I'd imagine this is
due to the card already coming with a
hefty overclock out of the box
admittingly I could have also spent some
more time tweaking the voltage or using
OC scanner to cop a few extra frames
still from what I can deduce the gtx
1070 is the new top choice when it comes
to price to performance and msi has done
a bang-up job presenting this GPU with
their gaming X lineup but what do you
guys think are you planning on picking
up a gtx 1070 or are you holding out
perhaps for something like AMD's R X 480
