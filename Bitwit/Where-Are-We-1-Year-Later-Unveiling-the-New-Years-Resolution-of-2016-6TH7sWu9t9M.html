one year ago when I posted my new year's
resolution video where I took a poll to
find out which monitor resolution we
were all rocking going into 2015 the
idea came about with the rapidly
changing face of the display market as
4k and 21 by nine panel adoption began
to spread like the plague while last
year's video showed us where we all lied
on the resolution scale the lack of any
data to compare it against made the
results less than revealing well earlier
this week I issued the same survey on
social media to see how the market has
shifted 365 days later and I'm happy to
report that the findings have already
started to paint a clear picture of
where we're headed here's the picture I
should also mention that these results
are not intended to reflect
multi-monitor setups but instead focus
on resolutions of the single primary
display that users are computing at so
without further ado here's a look at our
data chart which right off the bat we
can see a lot has changed in just one
year starting with the most glaring
difference is the huge exodus from 1920
x 1080 which plummeted a whopping
twenty-five percent and it's pretty
evident where users have fled as we see
an increase in nearly every other
resolution oddly enough 2016 welcomes a
higher percentage of users below 1080
but what's interesting is that we now
have more quad HD users than those
deprived of HD displays whereas last
year 2k took a backseat this can
certainly be attributed to the influx of
the insanely successful releases of quad
HD panels like the asus rog swift and
the acer xb 27 th you not to mention the
increasing affordability of high res
displays while the 16 by 9 aspect ratio
is still the undisputed champ we also
see some big gains for both of our 21 by
nine contenders many critics have had
their doubts about ultra wide
resolutions in years prior but our
findings point to a sizeable surge in
user adoption that's likely prompted by
the increasing market interest in curved
displays and the fierce competition
among manufacturers like LG acer and
asus as more offerings are released into
the ether and prices begin to fall
within obtainable means you can bet that
these percentages will continue climbing
over the next year of course not every
aspect ratio is receiving the same
the 16 by ten panels in our survey
appeared to have generated little to no
growth in popularity since last year
which really isn't too surprising when
you consider that they were never
terribly prevalent to begin with try to
name some flagship 16 by ten panels that
launched in 2015 off the top of your
head and you'll realize you can't the
stagnation in our data suggests that
while no one's eager to hop aboard the
16 by 10 train these days users of these
high potent ad resolutions probably
don't feel the need to upgrade at least
for now now it goes without saying that
2015 was a big year for 4k monitors TVs
and laptops sporting the resolution
popped up like daisies a plethora of
budget 4k panels were introduced and the
release of some powerful GPU is from
team red and green made 4k gaming more
possible than ever if not a tad
premature it seems sensible then why
more than double the percentage of users
have switched over to ultra HD since
last year granted the thought of owning
a 4k display in 2015 seemed impractical
to most of us and although quad HD still
seems to be the go-to option for
high-end gamers everywhere it'll be
interesting to see how the next
generation of GPU supporting new
architecture and drm technology will
shift our predisposition to 4k adoption
factor in the support of DisplayPort 1.3
and 2016 could bring about a new wave of
4k panels that can be pushed well past
the current 60 Hertz limitation making
ultra HD a tantalizing prospect finally
we saw a big jump in miscellaneous
resolutions outside of the ones that
were outright listed these are
presumably users with uncommon
dimensions that have been getting phased
out for quite some time or impending
signs of these small but steadily
growing army of the 5k master race in
closing it's really quite neat to see
how the display market progresses let
alone how quickly it does so I'm sure by
the end of 2016 will have an even
clearer picture of which pixel
preferences are merely fads of
yesteryear and which ones are in it for
the long haul but that's going to do it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
