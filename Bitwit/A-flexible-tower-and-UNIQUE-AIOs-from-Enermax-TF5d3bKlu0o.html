to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info what's
going on guys so I just checked out the
enter Mac Suites and let's talk about
their stuff saber a it's a new case if
it's up to 80 X boards I think it's a
full Tower it looks like a large mid
Tower or a full Tower I'm gonna I'm
gonna go with full Tower don't quote me
on that it's a fairly large case
naturally there's RGB lighting on this
thing that's you know gonna sync with
your motherboard apps and whatnot
tempered glass side panels on both sides
and there is a plexi front panel it's
actually not tempered glass but it looks
very convincing which is nice umm it
also seems to cut off quite a bit of
airflow from those front intake fans
however enter max includes a swappable
mesh front panel that's very easy to
sort of replace out for the plexi one
there is a five and a quarter inch drive
bay but it is removable if you wanted to
slap some fat radiators in there you can
do a 360 at the front or the top some
nice flexibility power supply shroud of
course and you've got three and a half
inch and two and a half inch drive trays
underneath behind the motherboard tray
you get an RGB hub and PWM fan
controller that supports up to eight
independent fans just to the right of
the motherboard on the back wall you get
a couple Drive trays for two and a half
inch drives or you could use those as
fan mounts you could actually mount a
couple 120s there I believe
enter max is gonna offer a steal side
panel on the rear with some ventilation
so that those fans could actually
exhaust hot air effectively and would
make much more sense the case includes a
trio of 120 millimeter twister bearing
or TB RGB fans those are right at the
front and of course one 120 non RGB fan
at the rear you also get an included RGB
strip which is nice the price point here
is 170 160 170 dollars u.s. and that's
gonna be available at the end of q2 let
me know what you guys think of this case
looks and and features in the comments
below next up they were also showing off
their lick tech 2 all-in-one liquid
cooler it's actually using the same pump
and radiator as they're very popular tr4
lick tech model the cooler will be
available in either a 240 or 360 there
may be a 2a
being released later down the line and
this is gonna go for $10 less than the
tr4 model I mentioned earlier starting
at 120 dollars for the 240 millimeter
radiator model that's actually a pretty
good price and this is gonna be
available early q2 now while the lick
tech 2 is very much performance driven
they also have their liquid fusion AIO
which is a little bit more on the flashy
side it might not have quite as amazing
as a pump as as the lick tech 2 but it
does have some fancy addressable RGB
LEDs the prototype that they had on
there at their suite was not functioning
properly so they couldn't actually show
it off they did show me a video on their
phone of how it's supposed to look and
yes I can confirm that they are
addressable RGB LEDs what I thought was
really cool about this product is that
there's a flow indicator built right
into the water block that allows you to
see if your pumps working so if you're
constantly worried that your pump might
be broken or something like that if the
unit's too quiet and you're paranoid
then that's that's a really surefire way
to see if it is it's also refillable
there's a port on the side of the water
block so you can obviously fill her up
if she gets low now like the lick tech
to the liquid fusion cooler is going to
support a wide variety of sockets on
both Intel and AMD all the popular ones
are good to go
RGB fans come standard the MSRP on this
unit is actually gonna be identical to
the lick tech 2 so you kind of get to
choose a unit that's more performance
driven versus one that maybe looks
prettier
I guess that's subjective of course this
is gonna be available in q2 so keep your
eyes peeled for that guys let me know
what you think about all this stuff in
the comments below as always feel free
to toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it and get subscribed to the
channel if you haven't already so you
