make stuff cool it makes stuff cool whoa
that's not supposed to happen
yeah hey honey this this isn't good you
know it's fine it's just a little
wardrobe malfunction nothing we can't
handle
where the heck did this Corvette come
from the does he even have a life
oh no he does not we spray put this
somewhere safe just go with the Celsius
line of all-in-one liquid coolers from
fractal design it's easy to stay cool
click on the link in the description for
more info what's up everybody how's it
going welcome back to the channel guys
usually with big launches like this I
like to start them off by saying today
we're going to check out the
long-awaited highly anticipated blah
blah blah but as we all know by now the
ex $2.99 high-end desktop platform from
Intel has been a topic of hot
controversy in recent weeks so I am NOT
going to start the video that way that
being said it is pretty interesting it's
an interesting launch it's there's
definitely a lot to talk about we've got
several new CPUs on the market as of
today we've got three skylake X CPUs
that are I think consisting of 6 8 and
10 core variants and we've got two KD
like X chips one of which we're taking a
look at today and that's the core i7
7740 X it is the more expensive or the
higher end of the 2 KB latex parts
though it is hyper threaded it's got
four cores eight threads a basin boost
clock of four point three and four point
five gigahertz respectively a slightly
higher TDP than its 7700 K predecessor
of 112 watts as opposed to 90 and then
we've also got eight megabytes of l3
cache 16 PCIe gen3 lanes which by the
way seems a bit limiting on a high-end
desktop platform especially when you're
paying premium 4 X 299 features and
additional connectivity like m dot 2 u
dot 2 PCIe gen3 lanes or slots and so
forth but only 16 lanes on the CPU which
again is a bit of a head-scratcher
there's going to be a lot of unanswered
questions probably from this video as we
are all still a little bit confused
about this launch another interesting
characteristic about KD like X is that
it only supports dual channel memory so
again here we have a motherboard that
has eight DIMM slots yet we can only
populate half of them and I've only put
two sticks in here for simplicity sake
but again one of one of the biggest
draws for me for Intel's high-end
desktop platform was just being able to
go crazy
with my ram capacity just being able to
max out all the slots and just have room
for expansion in the future but here we
again we have the same sort of
limitations we see on Zee 270 just with
a more expensive motherboard so it's
just again sort of a backwards move here
and then there's no I GPU I'm Caty like
X sorry sorry if you wanted an eye GPU
you don't have one anymore like you did
on regular cable a keen on X now again
most of us are going to be dropping in a
discrete GPU like this one on this
platform however it's still kind of nice
to have in certain situations if you
want to use it for just basic
troubleshooting for example or if you
want to take advantage of any of the
technologies that live on the chip
itself such as click sync if you want to
do some on-the-fly encoding you will no
longer be able to do that again probably
not a big deal for most of us but
something to be aware of if you are
going to be buying into KB like X now
there is something interesting about my
77 40 X here which I've probably already
given away through my title or thumbnail
but it's the fact that it's deleted this
is a deal it'ld chip not by me of course
this was a part given to me as a loaner
from the folks over a gigabyte they were
kind enough to let me borrow it to make
this video it was the last one that they
had on hand and it happened to be the
one that their engineering team got to
play with and delete it so bear in mind
all the performance numbers all the
thermals and temperatures everything
you're about to see all the results in
this video are not reflective of retail
performance because we are dealing with
the deleted chip and for those of you
who don't know be letting is a basic
basically a process where you remove the
internal heat spreader in layman's terms
the the silvery part on top of your CPU
you remove the silver part and that
gives you access to the dye and from
there you can actually replace Intel's
crappy thermal interface material job
with your own before replacing the
internal heat spreader and theoretically
that should give you better thermals and
much higher overclocking capabilities
and as we're about to CD letting
definitely did its job this thing is an
absolute monster
but again bear in mind as you as we go
about looking at the benchmarks
especially that this is not going to
reflect the sort of general average
consumer performance with Kb like X now
moving right along here I was able to
dial in a pretty hefty overclocked to
5.3 gigahertz on all cores at one point
four one five volts that was rock solid
stable again thanks to the help of the
Corsair
- 110 I hear as well as the fact that
this is a deal ended processor that
probably helps a lot now the fact that I
don't have a non belated 7740 ex to
compare this again makes it pretty
impossible for me to tell you exactly
how much of this overclocking Headroom
is attributed to the deleting process
versus just the fact that it's KB like X
and a newer CPU new or CPU so again
that's also going to apply to the
thermal results results are going to see
in benchmarking performance and
everything else now before we dive into
the rest of our testing Hardware here I
wanted to mention that the only CPU that
I'm pitting the 7740 X against today
will be the 7700 K on the z 270 platform
the reason why I'm comparing it to this
chip it's very similarly spec I mean
they're both hyper threaded they have
the same core and thread counts they're
more or less comparable even even
price-wise alright three hundred and
twenty-five dollars on Amazon last I
checked versus around 335 340 MSRP at
launch so again the big difference here
is for performances performance going to
be any difference because that might
sway users one way or another but then
be the platform itself XQ is just more
expensive hands down to buy into this
board like an entry-level X 299 board is
just going to require more upfront cost
than an entry-level Z 270 board now
these are entry-level I'm just just
saying so the question is is if you're
not really getting that many upgrades
with KT like X dual channel memory
support the eye GPU taken away and you
still you're limited to 16 PCIe lanes so
what the hell why are you going to spend
more on an excuse I just don't
understand again this is really the best
comparison that I have right now with
with the CPUs that I have at my disposal
is comparing these two and again even
that's not going to be super relative or
relevant because this is a belated
processor so again it's all I have I'm
sorry if this offends you or disappoints
you guys in any way but it's what I have
to work with it is what it is so on that
note slate and gentlemen I should
mention that I did overclock the 7700 K
to 5 gigahertz that was stable at one
point four to five volts I would
recommend that for 24/7 use but for the
purpose of our testing just trying to
push these guys as far as we can I mean
pretty much all the same hardware was
used on this EQ 70 platform with the
exception of the CPU of course and the
motherboard was the
is the MSI gaming Pro carbon so that was
used everything else is pretty much the
same so on a note guys let's go ahead
and roll tape and take a look at the
benchmarks for our deleted KB like X
processor
so there you guys have it
overall some really impressive thermals
I might add from simply deleting that 77
40 X my goodness but performance wise we
saw the cabling X processor here
outperform our 7700 K across the board
at the lower resolutions where we
weren't quite as GPU bound like we were
at 4k so at AVP in 1440p we saw gains
ranging anywhere from 5 to 14 percent I
think in one game which is pretty crazy
but I feel like even even if these were
off the shelf performance numbers that
you that you could achieve without even
be letting your processor I still feel
like like X 299 and KB like X as a
combination is a hard sell simply
because it just feels like a crippling
combo to me it feels like you know with
only 16 PCIe lanes and dual channel
memory support and all the things that
we talked about it pains me to spend
more on a motherboard that I can't fully
utilize and and for that reason I feel
like Kb like X these two processors that
just launched today they're way more
well suited for Z 270 and I feel like
Intel just for whatever reason as Linus
said in his rant video just sort of
stapled on the Scylla car the Year cue
Lake architecture on to an LGA 2066
socket gamers are very money conscious
creatures and I can't see many of them
paying full price for a new platform and
only getting half the features out of it
so for that reason if you're a die-hard
gamer and that's all you're doing is
gaming then I'd still recommend the 7700
K because it's going to be cheaper for
you in the long run and it's still a
wicked fast processor it's still one of
the fast can you can buy currently and
we can't ignore all of the solid
offerings on AMD side either I mean with
Verizon 5 and 7 thread Ripper coming up
it's it's hard to just migrate to KB
like X and X to 99 when you can still
get you know more than four cores and
eight threads for a much better price
overall better price to performance
better bang for your buck then KB like X
and X 299 hands down so if you are the
type of gamer who also maybe dowels in a
little bit of streaming maybe some video
editing anything else workstation
related then I still feel like Rison is
is the best bet right now and then we've
also got the future to look forward to
there's thread Ripper to talk about you
know more on that when
when more details come to light on that
not to mention in just a few months we
might be seeing Intel's new mainstream
platform replace KB Lake which is going
to be coffee lake and that's going to be
offering much more I think than KB Lake
X is currently with with a newer
architecture or refined architecture 14
nanometer plus plus or whatever it is
and and six cores potentially 6 cores 12
threads why why would you jump on KB
like X now when coffee lake is just
around the corner there's just a lot of
reasons why this one aspect of the X 299
platform just makes very little sense to
me but those are my overall thoughts
guys I can't really say much else here
that won't be a repeat of what someone's
already said in another YouTube video
elsewhere but let me know what your
guys's thoughts are on this whole topic
in the comments below I'm really curious
to hear what you have to say about it as
always and thank you so much for
watching this video be sure to toss me a
like on it if you did enjoy it feel free
to subscribe to the channel for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon and
until next time I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
