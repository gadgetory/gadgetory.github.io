oops uh gas so November specie of the
month is finally here and I apologize
for it popping up so late in the month
but sourcing the parts took a bit longer
than expected so thank you for your
patience this time around I've put
together the ultimate AMD 2016 gaining
machine that utilizes a pair of our x4
ATS that we'll be putting in crossfire
as well as you're going to love this in
eight core FX 95 90 am3+ cpu now before
you blow up the comments am i saying
that you should invest in a multi GPU
set up over a single faster card no
likewise am I suggesting that this is a
good time to invest in the am3+ platform
when Zen and am4 are right around the
corner absolutely not
so then why the hell am i building this
computer today I mean clearly I don't
need any more pcs and my heaters working
just fine well ironically AMD's upcoming
hardware is one of the main reasons why
I thought this would be an interesting
build from a reviewer standpoint the
parts in the system we're building today
represent AMD's latest offerings in the
CPU and GPU market so this PC will give
me a basis of comparison for testing
when Zen and Vega finally hit store
shelves now of course how the new AMD
Hardware stacks up against Intel and
NVIDIA will be a discussion that we'll
be having on this channel for a long
time but I also think it's important to
see team red outdo themselves and having
this rig in the studio will help us
measure their strides going into 2017 as
we welcome the arrival of Zen this build
also seemed like a fun way to pay homage
to AMD's antiquated CPU platform that
I'm sure those of you who bleed red will
certainly appreciate finally despite
this being the most poorly timed PC I've
ever built I'm confident that the
benchmarks in part 2 of this video will
validate it as a formidable gaming PC
I'll be it for a steep asking price on
that note I'm going to queue up some
music as we take a look at all the parts
we'll be using
followed by an obligatory time-lapse of
the assembly enjoy
you
you
you
all right build complete and looking
good I might add but as much as I would
love to install Windows and dive into
some testing right now that's gonna have
to wait for part two so stay tuned for
that
the follow-up video where we examine
overclocking gaming performance
acoustics and of course thermals we'll
see how that 95 90 performs under
pressure thank you guys for tuning in
and a huge thanks to Asus Corsair and
AMD for sponsoring the hardware for this
machine before you guys go don't forget
to toss me a look on this video if you
enjoyed it and feel free to check out my
store for new shirts and hoodies with
the bit lit logo as always thank you
guys for watching subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already and I'll
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
