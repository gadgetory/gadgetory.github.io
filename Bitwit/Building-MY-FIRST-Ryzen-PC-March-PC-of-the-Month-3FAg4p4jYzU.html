the channel today we are doing marches
PC of the month hell yeah just in the
nick of time too right before March
April April rolls around we're getting
this just in time so this is going to be
a rising build obviously celebrating the
new AMD platform on a m4 and it's
essentially going to be a gaming and
streaming sort of rig because I think
honestly that's what the r7 lineup right
now is really excelling in not to say
it's a slouch in gaming by any means but
I think at the end of the day if we're
going to get the most value for our
dollar might as well be doing some
heavily multi private applications for
this particular system so I've got a
bunch of parts behind me let's let's
let's talk about them so comprising the
overall backbone of this PC we've got
the rise in 717 hundred I went with this
over the 1,800 X because a it's cheaper
and B you can overclock it and more
let's get the same or similar
performance as the 1800 X so that's what
we're going with for today that's going
to be on the a be 350 gaming 3
motherboard from gigabyte I really
wanted to get there Oris gaming k7 board
because I think it looks super sexy but
it just wasn't on the shelves in time
and I was kind of in a hurry so we're
going with this one instead and that's
okay even though it's a B 350 or a be
350 chipset motherboard it's still going
to be enough for needs as you're about
to see because really using one graphics
card here and we don't have a ton of Io
that we're connecting to the system so B
350 is going to be just fine plus it's
black and red just like AMD carlo's baby
we've also got some RAM here's a ddr4
kit of vengeance LED this is not the RGB
one that just came out you can check out
my video on that if you haven't yet but
this is a 16 gigabyte kit so 2 by 8 gig
sticks this is the red of course the red
LED cut the red light bar so it's really
the only color that we're concerned with
at this moment and I forgot to mention
that the speed here is 3000 megahertz
sorry that the focus I thought I thought
that was on autofocus but apparently I
have to focus it why isn't it focusing
now whatever you guys get the idea
but here's our video card the MSI GTX
1080 gaming Z shoutout to Paul for
letting me borrow this card actually my
GT X 1080 gaming X is the one that I
gave away in the Nano s build a few
months back so I don't I didn't actually
have one of these cards with the red
out which is exactly what I was looking
for for the theme of this PC so thank
you Paul for let me loan for loan in
this Timmy this is a very very fast GPU
of course it's not a gtx 1080i or
anything but i didn't want to go to
balls-to-the-wall this is more so about
the theme itself and just sort of
celebrating the AMD colors and whatnot
with Rison even though it should have
been orange it really rising colors are
orange I know I know J did it J did it
better than I did I know but you know
red red comes pretty close it's close
enough I guess so we got the gaming Z in
there and then we've also got a cooler
which is the NH or the Noctua Nhu 1/2 s
SE AM for the special AM for Edition
that AMD actually gifted me when I was
in San Francisco a few weeks back and
the reason why I don't have the retail
packaging is because it wouldn't
actually fit in my carry-on so I had to
ditch the packaging and just basically
carry this cooler in my backpack which
was kind of awkward but this is a pretty
sweet cooler I love the black fan I'm
glad it's not brown and ugly like most
not to a fans and he thinks also looking
pretty good I was considering throwing
it in H 110 I in here from Corsair the
liquid cooler
it's a 280 millimeter AIO however we're
dealing with a 65 watt TDP chip over
here I didn't think of 280 millimeter
rad warranted was warranted for this
situation so we're going with an air
cooler instead it does look very nice by
the way
we've also got a power supply of course
fractal design Integra M is a 650 watt
units it is partially modular and it's
got some flat black cables which is
going to be nice because I'm not exactly
sure how the cable management situation
is going to be in today's chassis which
we're going to take a look at in just a
sec 80 plus bronze certification that's
always a good thing so I think you
freckle Josh for providing that we've
also got some goodies from cable mod
thank you cable Mon for hooking us up
with some of these really nice
extensions sleeved extensions as well as
a 60 centimeter to 60 centimeter red LED
strips that we're going to be putting in
here to make it all shine mass and
bright guys go ahead and check out links
in the description if you want to take a
look at any of the stuff for storage
we're going with the 250 gig hyper x 3k
SSD we don't actually have a mechanical
drive here but let's just assume that
one will be added in the near future but
for now this is the bare minimum that we
need so that's what we're going with and
then what was the other thing
oh yeah the case the case is probably
the most
interesting one of the most interesting
of course besides the rising ship of
course is one of the most interesting
things about this PC because I've never
heard of this manufacturer before they
are called
mean it or mean IT I honestly have no
idea which it is but I found this on new
egg as a new arrival and it's the 5:00
p.m.
I'm guessing that the the name of the
case and not the time that this product
was boxed or something I have no idea
it's very strange it's probably like
some Chinese manufacturer that's new to
America or whatever trying to make a
breakthrough in the chassis industry and
the chassis market but I thought it was
a really cool looking case very
minimalistic got tempered glass it comes
with three I believe three or four led
fans that are red and they look pretty
wicked so hopefully there's no surprises
with this chassis it was fairly
affordable too which makes me a little
nervous and there was not a single
review that I could find of this case
online so I don't know maybe up maybe
I'm like one of the first youtubers to
actually build in this chassis it's kind
of kind of exciting I'm for once I have
no idea what to expect with it with a
case so this should be fun
but I think on that note guys those are
pretty much all the parts so why don't
we go ahead and kick it off with a quick
little time-lapse and put this rig
together
Cham Cham Cham coming
jump jump sound coming
all right so here's the build pretty
sexy if I do say something sales yes
everything went or let's move one thing
that is not smooth is the edges of this
dust filter here they are razor sharp so
that's just a sign of manufacturers
trying to cut corners trying to get the
highest margins on their cases you can
really see where they are slacking off
in some areas with the build quality
here but for the most part this is very
similar to there's another type of case
that I've seen recently that I'll pop up
in text right here cuz I can't think of
the name but this seems very similar to
that one now that I've built in it's
probably the same om something like that
but overall not too bad it's a little
bit bare inside it looks like there's
since there's no like sort of drive cage
up here or anything in the top right
corner just looks a little empty but for
the most part I'd rather it be spacious
than super cramped and the grommets here
well there are no real grommets there's
actually no grommets they're just
cutouts which is kind of lame and
there's this weird cover thing that's
held in place by a thumb screw which you
can remove but it's just another empty
slot there's no grommets underneath that
as well so kind of an awkward little
cable routing technique there but
whatever it does the job I suppose I do
like the fact that there's a cutout here
with the grommet this is the only
grommet that I can see in the case
but unfortunately there is no like
there's no little holes in the the
basement shroud for like grounding your
front panel connectors luckily I was
able to route them through this this big
one here but there's none there's one
little tiny one for your HD audio in the
back there but not the most convenient
and the biggest disappointment with this
case really because it's fairly well
designed is the stupid fans I bought
this case because the fans are supposed
to light up all nice and bright and
glowy from the picture that I saw online
but these this is as bright as it goes
and I don't know if you can tell but in
person they're not very bright at all in
fact that's why I have the cable mod
lighting off right now because with it
on it's so bright the cable mod strips
are so bright which is a great thing but
it pretty much drowns out the red the
LED on the fans so you can't even see
them very well most like it's super dim
in your room so that's kind of
disappointing look at this there's
there's an op off setting okay it turns
them off low high low and high or
exactly the same what the hell that is
does great ABS man so I'll open the
point with that near there something we
can do with that in part 2 of this video
stick around for that but hey first rise
and build official rising build 2017 I'm
super stoked let me know what you guys
think of the build in the comments below
and also feel free to toss me a like on
the video wow I really stopped
recording on myself just there I'm tired
but that's going to do it for now guys
thank you so much for tuning in
stick around for part two where we do a
full system analysis of this guy right
here should be pretty fun with that 1700
and all and yeah have yourselves a good
day I already say like the video now you
guys already know the drill
have a good one guys I'll see you later
bye and nothing comes after bye it's
just bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
