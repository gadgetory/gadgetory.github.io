channel this is a much-needed follow-up
video to last week's gaming showdown
between my five-year-old computer and a
modern-day skylake PC which was kind of
like watching Ronda Rousey beat up a
small kitten or watching Holly Holm bait
up Ronda Rousey as expected the results
showed the new PC leading by a landslide
indicating that my old rig was in need
of a sizeable upgrade in order to stay
competitive and while that's still true
to some degree in the video I failed to
specify which part of my old PC would
make the most sense to upgrade and this
might have caused some confusion after
all a typical gaming workload is far
more GPU bound than it is CPU dependent
so there's a fair chance that simply
upgrading the video card in my old
system would have allowed it to yield
similar gaming results as our skylight
build this would be great news for us
because it would mean that we'd have to
spend significantly less money on a
single component to essentially
recommission our old gaming rig so in
order to find out if a new GPU is really
all it takes to get us back in the game
so to speak today will once again be
comparing my old Sandy Bridge PC to our
skylake build this time around however
we'll be using the GPU a gtx 970 as a
constant having the same beefy video
card in both systems will help us
pinpoint any cpu slowdowns of our older
2600 k and ultimately reveal whether
it's worth upgrading to something like
the 6700 k in our current gen pc now
before we look at the benchmarks another
oversight from last week's video that I
wanted to quickly address is my
referring to our skylake build here as a
2016 PC when the system is in fact using
hardware that released no later than
2015 so my apologies for the misleading
Burbidge I should have learned by now
that if you stretch the truth to
thousands of people usually someone will
notice on to our testing methodology
though my old rig has been reincarnated
as my wife's current gaming PC using our
core i7 2670 7 platform with 8 gigs of
ddr3 whereas our current gen system is a
cut-down version of my sleeper PC
featuring the latest 6700 K on the z170
chipset with 16 gigs of DDR for both
systems are using this EVGA GTX 970 for
the win Edition
ethics CAD we're also using the same
overclock settings as we did in last
week's video except the 2600 K has
received a 100 megahertz boost since
then landing it at 4.5 gigahertz our
6700 K remains at a stable 4.4 gigahertz
and our GTX 970 was overclocked just
north of 1500 megahertz in both systems
all games tested were run at full HD and
quad HD on a final note the skylake PC
is running Windows 10 and due to ongoing
driver issues that I mentioned last week
the Sandy Bridge is on Windows 8.1 so
without further ado let's dive right in
with 3dmark fire strike Xtreme as you
can see both computers are completely
neck-and-neck in their overall score
with the old system actually bringing
home a slightly higher graphics score
whether this is due to differently
matured OS drivers or simply a margin of
error I can't be sure but the synthetic
test looks very promising for our 2600 K
that being said if leave it to our first
gaming benchmark to tell us a slightly
different story in GTA 5 we see the 6700
K with an increase in average FPS by 28%
at 1080 the biggest performance gap
you'll see in today's testing move along
to quad HD however and the new rig only
performs 8 percent better on average so
why is the performance gap between the
two pcs so much wider at the lower
resolution well this is actually our
first sign of CPU bottlenecking with the
2600 K with the lower resolution of 1080
our GTX 970 is able to draw frame so
quickly that it's left waiting on the
cpu to send it instructions for more
frames you could say that the GPU is
filling orders faster than the 2600 K
can write them when gaming at higher
resolutions however most of the
additional work required to render those
extra pixels falls on to the GPU so the
CPU is then able to keep pace much more
effectively and is no longer the
bottleneck in fact the system has now
become GPU bound at the higher
resolution and since both systems are
using the same GPU this explains the
smaller performance gap between them at
quad HD circling back to the game though
it's pretty evident that our upgraded
2600 K is more than capable of handling
GTA v with no minimum dips below 30 FPS
even beyond 1080 hitman absolution
yields very similar results where we see
a big leap at 1080 for the 6700 K and a
much smaller performance gain at quad HD
another
I'm example of CPU bottlenecking at low
resolutions all the same the 2600 K
system saw a great overall performance
with no red flags indicating the need to
upgrade our system further in Metro last
light we see the continued trend of a
wider performance gap at 1080 but much
less so this time around this mostly
stems from the benchmark being
incredibly taxing which means our GTX
970 already has its hands full at 1080
since the GPU is hard at work neither of
our CPUs are really breaking a sweat at
this point which is why there's little
to showcase the performance difference
between our Sandy Bridge and skylight
chips finally the results in battlefield
4 parallel those found in the Metro last
light benchmark as this is also right up
there on the list of demanding triple-a
titles performance gains of the current
gen PC are so minimal here that it could
almost be chopped up to margin of error
but either way this demonstrates how
relevant the 2600 case still is
especially at high resolutions or in GPU
intensive games so to be perfectly clear
if you have an older high-end system
from half a decade ago simply slapping
in a new video card can certainly
breathe new life into your PC since GPUs
are seeing bigger improvements year over
year than CPUs and not to mention most
games rely heavily on GPU processing
anyway unless you require additional CPU
horsepower for workstation applications
or you're just an enthusiast who always
needs to be on the latest platform an
upgraded system like this should suffice
quite nicely for the next few years but
that's pretty much gonna wrap it up for
now guys hopefully this quick video
cleared up some things that I left out
last week and hopefully those of you
with ageing desktops found this video to
be a bit helpful if any of you guys were
using older CPUs paired with newer video
cards by the way feel free to share your
setups in the comments below and let us
know how that's been working out for you
