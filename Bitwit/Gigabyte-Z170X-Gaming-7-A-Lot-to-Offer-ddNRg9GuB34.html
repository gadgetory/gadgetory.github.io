launch of Intel skylake CPUs we have
seen a flood of z170 motherboards follow
suit so today I'm going to be checking
out one of these mid-range options from
a team over at gigabyte this is their
z170 X gaming 7 which comes densely
packed with some exciting features for
around 220 USD I think the last time I
saw this many features in one place was
the dashboard of a cop car while I was
in the front seat as you can tell
gigabyte has a door to their z170 line
of gaming motherboards with a red black
and white color scheme accompanied by
silver accents on the heatsinks
shielding the i/o is an oversized
cosmetic cover plate that resembles a
slab of futuristic armor leading me to
believe that this board might have been
a transformer in another lifetime if
you're a fellow of simpler tastes like
myself you can remove the three small
screws in back of the cover plate and
voila
I guess this board is a transformer
although that's got to be the saddest
transformer ever when you think about it
you're a transforming car that's amazing
what do you transform into um a car
without a bumper Oh
while everything on the board including
the matte black PCB feels incredibly
sturdy and well built all of the white
you see on the motherboard is coated
with a reflective gloss which in my
opinion makes the board look a bit
cheaper than it really is
perhaps a matte finish or more metallic
pieces could spruce up the aesthetic in
future iterations up front and center is
our LGA 1151 socket for Intel 6th
generation of skylake CPUs though the
socket isn't backwards compatible with
previous gen chips the heatsink mount
has stayed the same so you can still
bring over your 1150 1155 or 1156
CPU cooler when switching to the new
platform next door are four dimm slots
for ddr4 modules that support dual
channel mode and XMP 2.0 profiles and
with the higher density of ddr4 the
gaming seven also supports capacities up
to 64 gigs and speeds up to 38 66
megahertz of course at the heart of this
board is Intel z170 chipset which now
supports 10
native USB 3 ports and 20 PCIe lanes
over the eight lanes that were available
on z97 this increase has led gigabyte to
include not one but two X 4m 2 slots at
32 gigabits per second which is great
news with the availability of PCIe m2
SSDs on the rise supported drive lengths
include forty to sixty or eighty
millimeters if you don't need these
super fast read and write speeds however
each slot does support the cheaper and
more widely available SATA protocol as
well on the right side of the board
you'll find six SATA six ports which are
natively controlled by the z170 chipset
two more SATA six ports running through
an AZ media controller and three SATA
Express connectors 3-way SLI and
crossfire configurations are available
with the board's PCIe by 16 slots with
the top slot running at x16 the middle
slot at x8 and the bottom at x4 bear in
mind though that the top slot runs at x8
in a 2a setup and the bottom slot shares
bandwidth with the nearest m2 slot
meaning only one of them can be active
at a time Universal to their gaming line
of motherboards gigabyte has also
reinforced all of their PCIe by 16 slots
with metal shielding to provide extra
strength when supporting heavy graphics
cards since I've personally never had a
PCIe connector give out under the weight
of a hefty card this alleged support
system seems about as useful to me as a
jockstrap designed for little leaguers
now that being said I don't particularly
mind the extra eye candy that this
metallic plating brings to the board by
the way you also get three PCIe by one
slots cool story bro for onboard audio
gigabyte has added a creative sound Core
3d quad core chip and next to it is a
removable cover plate with a stylish
tray slight cutout you can also change
the color of the LEDs in the included
audio suite although I can't imagine
anything other than red or white
complementing the rest of the board's
aesthetic now before we hit all the
little trinkets scattered around the
board here's a quick look at your 5 for
pin fan headers with pwm support now in
the upper right hand corner you get 8
voltage measurement points surface
mounted power and reset buttons a clear
CMOS button and a debug LED all of which
are great features to have whether
you're doing a test boot outside of your
chassis or just trying to figure out why
the hell your system won't post just
beneath is an OC button that grants you
a quick and easy automatic overclock and
next to it is an eco button which
essentially kicks your system into Prius
mode
moving on you get two USB three headers
a dual BIOS switch an audio gain control
switch that you can configure depending
on the impedance of your speakers or
headphones and a removable op-amp which
you can easily replace with one of your
own to create the sound signature of
your preference finally on the rear i/o
you get a ps2 port 5 USB 3 ports with
the yellow ones for USB Dax DisplayPort
and HDMI video outs 2 rj45 Gigabit
Ethernet LAN ports with a killer 8 2400
controller a USB 3.1 type C and USB 3.1
type a port for 10 gigabits per second
transfer speeds 5.1 analog audio jacks
and spdif out so like I mentioned
earlier there really are a ton of
features on this board unfortunately
many of those features are actually
quite useful to the average enthusiasts
and overclocker
when you consider the wealth of next-gen
functionality you're getting out of this
board compared to let's say a similarly
priced z97 option the sheer value of the
z170 X gaming 7 really starts to sink in
now if you were considering gigabytes
flagship offering you'd have to shell
out more than double the cash for their
gaming g1 model and while it does pack
in some useful features like BRM water
cooling support I personally feel that
the gaming 7 yields far more bang for
the buck so if you're like many other
system builders out there who are
looking to switch to skylake without
breaking the bank
this boards excellent build quality and
impressive feature set should keep you
gaming happily for years to come but let
me know what you guys think of this
board in the comments and don't forget
to test me I like on this video if you
enjoyed it before you go feel free to
check the description below for an
awesomesauce shirt like this one at the
moment I am nearly sold out of all of
the CPU cooler shirts but rest assured I
will be getting those back in stock in
all sizes in about a week or so also go
ahead and bookmark my Amazon affiliate
link and use it to the next time you buy
your portable air conditioner thank you
to whoever bought that using my link by
the way you basically just paid for my
internet this month as always I'm Kyle
with awesomesauce Network thank you guys
for watching and subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already and I'll
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
