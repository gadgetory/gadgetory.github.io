channel so you remember my PC of the
month for December of last year I'm sure
it wasn't too long ago this is the epic
RGB build I don't even think I need to
say that anymore it's just pretty it's
pretty obvious just from looking at it
but I didn't really do a true follow up
video to the part one I did do an
overclocking video with the daleks gtx
1070 in here as well as the 6600 k go
ahead and check that out if you haven't
but what i want to do today is just
focus on the RGB LEDs and i know i know
it's gotten way out of hand
I agree and I admit I'll be the first to
admit I'm part of a problem that being
said I did want to check out some of the
lighting profiles that we can configure
in here there's a lot going on I've got
the NZXT hue plus as well as their RGB a
or fans there's two of them in there
they're 120 as well as the the Kraken
pro not the Kraken pro 52 Kraken X 52
and the latest addition is the RGB kit
from g.skill so they're tried Enzi RGB
and they just send it over to me it's
brand new brand spankin new and that's
why I actually waited so long to do this
video because I was waiting on these
modules to get in and I never thought
they would get here but they finally
have so thank you to g.skill for sending
those here their software isn't fully
ready yet but they did send me a copy as
long as I don't show you the actual UI
I'm free to use it but you don't even
need their software really you could
also configure the LEDs through Asus
aura so the aura software does support
the tried NZ RGB modules and can do a
bunch of different effects that way as
well but we're going to be doing it
straight from the g.skill app and so
yeah we've got a lot of stuff to tinker
with here and I actually just tweeted I
sent a tweet to all you guys asking you
to give me one word to describe the type
of lighting profile you'd like to see me
set up in here and I haven't even
checked the tweets yet so I have no idea
I am super intrigued and a little
nervous as to what kind of suggestions
you guys have given me so I'm going to
be reading them aloud as we go about the
video and configuring the LEDs all the
same time so let's go ahead and jump
into the software so here we are in the
NZXT cam software you can see we've got
our Kraken in our Q plus that we'll be
configuring within this app we've also
got extreme tutor Plus which is going to
control the LEDs on the galaxy gtx 1070
and of course the g.skill app which I
cannot show you but I will be
using of course to customize those
modules so let's go ahead and take a
look at our first suggestion in Twitter
on Twitter which is from rooster and he
he suggested Miami
oh good ol rooster I believe he actually
lives in Miami and this is a great
suggestion I think because I'm a huge
fan of my like retro Miami colors of
course hotline my custom water cooled
build and can't forget hotline Miami so
I'm going to try out alternating let's
go ahead and see how that looks
let's do so this is very reminiscent of
slot machine the lighting effect that I
did for hot line back in the day but
we're going to go ahead and start off
with that and now to mess around with
our x52 I'm going to select logo LED and
let's see let's cue fading sounds good
and we'll do the same colors apply so
that's the that's just the center logo
the NZXT branding on the middle of the
water block there so then we got it also
do the ring LED let's do yeah fading we
do the same thing I could just sync them
of course I could crank up the speed
here oh yeah that looks nice and then in
extreme tuner plus I say the options
here are very limited of course you can
do any color you want but it's in terms
of effects and speed and things like
that there's not much granularity with
control so I found that breathing is
pretty much our best bet and
unfortunately none of these these speeds
work whether it says three seconds or 10
seconds the cycling period is exactly
the same so let's keep that but this is
looking pretty good so far and then
finally we're going to jump into the G
scale software some of the music options
here under hip hop I think I was looking
around and I thought this one would look
pretty good especially because it's
already preset to basically the colors
that we're already using for this theme
so it kind of just fades back and forth
there's a little bit of a wave looks
really cool and there we have our hot
line theme one down let's see how many
more should we do let's do like four or
five more our next lighting theme will
be vomit vomit good ol thanks cream ale
for that gem of a suggestion I don't
know why we're doing it but
let's go ahead and try to make a vomit
lighting profile so let's do a marquee
this time around and we'll do kind of a
see these greens here we want it we want
what I think of vomit I think of like
not just green but like a yellowish
green extend with some brown so let's do
like this see how this looks so yeah
that looks that looks nauseating that's
quite disgusting so I'm group size let's
try five this is a how many LEDs are
moving at a time the ones going around
the trim of the case and then we'll do
go backwards let's let's do something
different with the fans actually let's
uh let's see let's also do a marquee
because I like the way that looks let's
change up the color to make it a little
bit more
well more disgusting let's put some more
disgusted in there let's go ahead and do
the brown Oh God
test the worst thing I've ever seen
let's go ahead and sink both the logo
and the ring will do a fading effect do
that yellow yellowish green again to
brown will fade fade between two hideous
colors boom boom okay yep this this
whole system all of a sudden it went
from like really nice retro Miami theme
to looking like something you'd find in
the toilet but we're not done yet what
do we do for the video girl let's do the
ramp first Ram will do breathing you
breathing
there we go oh god this is hideous oh
that's it this is so sick yeah that
definitely looks like vomit to me or at
least it makes you wanna vomit so there
we have our vomit theme actually let's
hold on let me change the via the color
of the GPU of the graphics card to try
and find the right right shade of crap
here that'll do that'll do I'm not sure
how well it's picking up on the camera
but from here it looks disgusting so
mission complete thanks cream ale for
that awful suggestion let's hurry up and
change it to something a little bit
better that's not going to affect us
negatively oh great this next suggestion
is you
even worse seizure I knew this was going
to come up and this is from the one and
only gamers Nexus I have a feeling the
infamous Steve is behind this one so
let's go ahead and try to do a seizure
all-out inducing nightmare let's go
ahead and sync up fans and LED strips
again and I think pulse is the only
option honestly let's go ahead and make
that white and apply oh you know it we
got it we got to pick this up we got to
pick this up there we go now we're on to
something just do a fixed profile for
the kraken logo let's do these
independently we'll do the logo first
and white I think I'm just gonna make
this all white and then for the ring
covering marquee perhaps let's see what
this looks like save okay we needed
obviously to go faster oh boy yeah
that's that is quick so with the
graphics card again there aren't many
options we're just going to do I would
do strobing but unfortunately you can't
make it going faster than this and it
changes colors it doesn't stay white it
it's like oh so I think we're just going
to do breathing and then I think that
just leaves us with the g.skill RAM so
so go ahead and see what we got here
whoo there's a strobing effect and boom
there we go unfortunately we can't make
the the effect on the RAM go any faster
but we do have a nice strobing effect
kind of goes across the the four sticks
in white so there there's our there's
our seizure our seizure build or a
seizure profile hope your hope you're
all satisfied specially you Steve this
one's for you I am going to change this
let's skip the hell out of this mode so
moving on to our next theme we've got
actually this one was pretty popular we
got a couple people suggesting these
particular themes acid we had acid and
from from good ol ancho our buddy ancho
and LSD okay why do all the things that
are bad for you make such great led
profiles I have no idea
where's the connection I'm not seeing it
but I guess we'll just go ahead and try
this out this is this also kind of falls
in with like rainbow people were saying
rainbow or skittles
so we're I guess this kind of
all falls into that but what kind of
create some sort of psychedelic theme
here that's obviously going to heavily
rely on the spectrum wave I think let's
do let's try this out first though it
might just be good on default we might
just be good to go here and I think I
think the speed is good if you go too
slow
gets a little chop-chop-chop at a chop
but if you go too fast just I mean that
doesn't really remind me of an acid trip
acid is a bit more gradual it's a bit
more slow-moving and methodical things
are melting they're not it's not cocaine
so let's just try that level forward a
foreword for it I guess smell let's do
backwards screw it we're going back to
the future okay that looks pretty good
so far and jump into the creation let's
do again the same speed Save Changes on
that bad boy oh yeah that looks good and
then was you all or what are we gonna do
for our frickin graphics card oh the
here we can do like a cycle breathing
effect because cycle breathing just it
just cycles between different colors so
that's that's looking good and then
finally with the rams let's do um wave
maybe wave ooh that's pretty that's
pretty yeah I could look at this all day
just hold this will put me in a trance
that looks glowing yo yo hey I actually
kind of like that let's do that I'm
saying this is done this is our acid LSD
skittles taste the rainbow see it kind
of creates the perception that the
hardware is a living organism makes you
wonder how we even know the difference
between reality and what's in our minds
man next up we've got a portal
suggestion from Bernard that's a good
one I like the way you think Bernard
let's try going with just a fixed oh not
red straight white yeah yeah that looks
see this looks like aperture
laboratories right here just like really
bright fluorescent lighting you feel me
but you know what we haven't done in a
while let's go ahead and unsink the fans
from from the strips and do something
fun with the fans independently of the
strips what's breathing
let's do fading and the robot colors
from from Portal which is orange and
kind of a light blue I was going a
little slow speed that up I kind of like
that it brings it to life a bit more
than just a straight fixed white LEDs
and alright so then let's do the Kraken
breathing effect blue and orange let's
just do white for our GPU and finally
our key skill try that D alright and
there's our portal theme guys looking
good whoo
if you want to slap like a big aperture
labs decal on the front of the case but
we're about to change up the theme one
last time let's do one more and let's
see suggestion rave let's do a rebel of
course of course we got to do a rave one
this could also be ecstasy or Molly some
of you guys were suggesting you guys are
so bad you guys terrible terrible kids
so naughty all right let's do rape
though it might be a good opportunity to
show off the new base feature within cam
so we're going to need music for this
though so I'm going to this is only
going to react when there's music
playing within the operating system so
we're not going to know exactly what
this looks like
until I fire up some tunes so let's just
do let's do purple
I think purple sounds like a good rave
color to me and then let's do the same
thing for de dooda dooda how much should
we do purple again let's do white let's
see white on that boom alright and then
for the GPU I will just be stupid
breathing let's do that in let's see
like a green could we do like a neon
green alright let's just go with that
and hmm let's see you play let's see
here I'll show we do some around oh hey
yeah that's for you rabies
that looks pretty gravy to me breath oh
you can actually do up and down instead
of just flowing down so now it goes up
and down
cycling bouncing back and forth and of
course we should increase the speed
obviously whoo
okay there we go all right let's fire up
some tunes really quick and see what we
go what kind of monster we've created
well there you have it guys those are
all the profiles that I have for you
today let me know which one was your
favorite tell me in the comments which
one did you like the best
and maybe we'll do this again sometime
perhaps not with this bill but if I ever
do another system in the future that has
lots of RGB maybe we'll do another kind
of like maybe we'll do it live next time
you guys can give me your suggestions
and chat and I'll just do it on the fly
right there that might be kind of cool
so um again as white list says this
video was I had a lot of fun making it
so hopefully you enjoyed watching it be
sure to tUFF me a like on the video if
you did and also feel free to subscribe
to the channel for more tech stuff and
all that good stuff have a good one guys
I will see y'all in the next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
