microphone right here it's a boom Pole
it's on a boom pole right now so the
audio might shift as I walk around the
room you might see it that it doesn't
sound as clear over here as it does when
I'm more centered but this is my first
vr livestream ever
I have never live-streamed a virtual
reality experience before so forgive me
for all of the technical difficulties
that are probably about to ensue but
hopefully everything's okay for now I
don't see any dropped frames in xsplit
as of now but let me know how everything
looks how it sounds you should be able
to see me on the left side of the screen
and then some some gameplay footage on
the right I've got the HTC vive right
here all set up and ready to go I am in
my office right now as you can see I've
got my - my two sensor my two sensors
mounted in the appropriate positions on
opposing corners of my room and we're
gonna be playing some hover junkers
today however junkers is basically kind
of like the Wild West
in the future and you're essentially
Manning a single hovercraft and you roll
around a map you know an enclosed map
basically killing other hovercraft
pilots and and picking up loot along the
way to armor your vehicle get better
upgrades weapons things like that it's a
very straightforward game but it's super
fun especially with the HTC vive and
you're about to see why if you don't
already know the wonders that it entails
but let's say no we're not doing VR porn
Joker I'm sorry that's gonna be on this
that's a special thing I have worked out
just between you and me man I'm not
gonna show that to the public right
that's that's you and I is let's let's
not talk about that right now but yes so
everything looks pretty good on your end
according to you guys so I'm going to go
ahead and just jump right into it and
see what exactly I can do I've only
played this game about three times
before I think this is my fourth time
playing and so I'm not very good I get
lucky I got lucky the other day I've got
a pretty good kill streak for a while
but that's probably all gonna fall the
shit now that I'm live-streaming in
front of an audience
if you know you know how that goes so
I've got the headset on right now and
forgive me I'm not going to be able to
read or reply to any of your comments
and chat simply because uh well you know
so I'm gonna go ahead and feel around
for my headset I'm using a steel series
H Wireless there is a connector for a
3.5 millimeter audio jack that's that's
connected directly to the HTC vive
however I just found going Wireless in
this case is just so much nicer when you
already have this big-ass cable that you
have to worry about coming straight from
the headset so the wireless works for me
go ahead and situate these alright and I
got to go reach around for my
controllers reach around pay okay so um
it's really quick I just want to make
sure that this is all tracking correctly
in YouTube on the stream okay let me
read your comments really quick okay
cool none of you are writing in chat so
I'm guessing everything's looking good
so far okay I'm in the target practice
section right now which is which is
pretty cool
I'll see see if I remember how to do
this so if you're all my weapons I
basically got you know you go to hand
hands are useful for pressing buttons
and things such as that that's a target
that I can try to go up up wasn't
reloaded let's try to this again yeah
yeah yeah okay so things are working
this is a really cool game and takes
advantage of the motion controllers very
nicely so for example you've got this
revolver here and once you're out in
order to reload you basically hit the
the TREC the trackpad circular trackpad
once that opens up your your chamber and
then you simply use your thumb and spin
it around the trackpad in a wheel until
all of your bullets are now reloaded in
the chamber and you simply flick the
flick the the chamber back into place
with your wrist it's it's so intuitive
that the first time I actually let my
wife try this I didn't even need to tell
her to flick the chamber back in place
he just automatically like just based on
response was like alright this
sense to go like that and sure enough it
works and it's pretty awesome how
they've done it there's also the shotgun
which it works kind of similarly not
really like this gun because there's
only three bullets but in order to
reload press the trackpad and then three
you just tap it in three more times so
one for each shell and then you simply
cock it back like so so again let me
just show to you yeah it's it's it's
pretty pretty fucking sweet okay let's
let's get out here and actually try to
play some games how do I do this and
press here to leave it also takes
advantage of the room scale as you can
see I'm standing in my room and have
some a bit of freedom to walk around and
do things essentially the hovercraft
that you're usually piloting is pretty
small but you can still walk around in
that limited space to make it really
feel like you're aboard a ship and not
just sitting in a cockpit for example so
we're gonna go ahead and enter at our
own risk this is one of my favorite
parts about this game is the lobby area
the matchmaking area it's just really
cool how they've done it so there's
there's this guy Gunther Gunther he's
the the bartender the robotic bartender
and it's just it's just too easy to
abuse him there's like no reason why you
shouldn't you can throw them over the
counter you can literally pick them up
and just start you know you want them
around and whatnot see if I can throw
him out the window
yeah I'm not I'm not really being the
best role model for all you young uns
right now don't don't treat people like
this or robots they don't deserve it but
this is just I laugh my ass off like and
just couldn't stop laughing once I first
saw this and figured out that you could
do all this stuff to him it wasn't until
other people were actually in the lobby
with me in this bar with me when I just
started seeing him getting the shit beat
out of him
very sad poor poor Gunther and there's
also cool things you can do here like
this is just a matchmaking area but it's
like a minigame in itself there's a
whole a bunch of little things you can
do it so for example you can umm well
he's he's seizuring out now so you can
like try throwing something in the
and the basketball hoop up there I am a
horrible shot but ideally if you can get
something in there
all right this gives you an indication
of how good I'm gonna be at this game so
I got a point right there so you can you
throw things in the hoop to exit you
simply just hit the exit sign man even a
juke box which you can pause or change
the track which is super cool
it does have boy so this is a
multiplayer game guys I should have
mentioned that obviously you probably
figured that out once I said the word
matchmaking but here you can see I've
got my little server's going on here so
we've got three people in this server
and that looks that looks pretty good
but apart from that you can choose your
character there's only three three
selectable characters for now different
ships so you can't get a larger ship and
I do believe you can have multiple
people on a single ship so you can have
one person essentially piloting the ship
and another person you know primarily on
guns on the on the offense so we're
gonna go ahead and jump into the server
just a single man hovercraft
oh wait am i oh I didn't want a medium
ship I want this one the Gopher oh did I
accidentally select the big-ass ship I
hope not all right so this is just a
loading screen and I think you guys are
over there I'm pretty sure the cameras
over there I've kind of lost my bearings
no it's not it's it's over there okay so
you guys are in this area
how's everything looking so far similar
looking all right huh huh some one way
what's happening what's going on
oh no what's what's happening what's
wrong with the stream is it not working
uh no good thing I looked you can't see
shit now why the hell isn't this working
can you guys hear me still it's been
frozen since I entered the lobby let me
go ahead and try refreshing this guy's
hey is that working now you see my head
moving
should be working all right saved it all
right hold on I think it should be good
now let me know come on rip rip rip
frozen yes yes yes
okay everyone's saying that it looks
good now okay you can hear me yeah
Wow there's a lot of people watching
right now aren't there there's too many
of you guys get the hell out of here
this is supposed to be intimate okay
works now we're back in yeah I'm gonna
try to check it as regularly as I can
guys I'm gonna try to check the chat
it's really difficult when you're in the
headset and you're you're kind of locked
in you know with the with the uh with
the whole shebang
but I'm gonna do my best every you know
every time I die maybe I'll take a
glance at the chat although it's it's
easier said than done it really is okay
so good for now okay then I'm gonna I'm
gonna go ahead and proceed do I have
your guys's blessing to go ahead with
with trying this out I'm gonna put it
back on now putting the headset back on
engage but you know what's interesting
is now now I'm getting a little bit of
like stuttering when I look around which
is kind of strange now why is that why
is that why is that what's happening
I've been waiting for too long so I'm
gonna go ahead and just reboot hover
junkers I think cuz maybe the game just
froze because it's it's really not
perfect quite yet I mean it is retail
ready and things like that but if
there's a couple bugs in the game as I'm
sure there are in many of the launch
titles for the HTC vive as is gonna be
the case for the oculus rift it's just
nature of the beast guys so I'm gonna go
ahead and restart
however junkers let's reboot dish up
let's boot into
there there there dad dad dad yeah yeah
so that's a good point about the the
eyeglasses you know how how's the
comfort level with with eyeglasses these
aren't like huge frames and they're not
the smallest either they're average size
and you can definitely get away with
playing in them it's perfectly
comfortable it's maybe maybe adds a
little bit of tightness to to your
comfort level however I'd say the
biggest issue with having glasses at
least for someone like me is that I tend
to get very hot very easily I sweat a
lot
you know there's steam coming off of me
within the first five minutes of playing
a game like this so what happens is my
lens is actually fog up and at first I
thought it was the lenses on the HTC
vive but they're actually pretty pretty
fog resistant from what I can tell they
don't fog up too easily it's just the
lenses of my glasses are not are not
eyes are not as awesome so that would be
one reason why I'm really considering
replenishing my contacts in the near
future so let's see do we have do we
have hover Junkers what's going on here
come on own app is already running my
ass steam son of a bitch bitch I do not
see hover Junkers at all
Plan B are you dick no we're not doing
any fat chick VR porn I told you that's
that's reserved for me and Joker all
right that's our that's our sexy time
alone wow this is really bizarre I feel
like the Cowardly Lion from Wizard of Oz
maybe perhaps I will try relaunching
steamvr steamvr is also it's got its
quirks you know it's not perfect for the
most part I like it a lot but it does F
up from time to time I've had a few
crashes and games like hover Junkers for
example job simulator a couple others
all right
let's launch this shit come on come on
the components from the yeah okay all
right that's back on
saying a component is not working
properly which is total bullshit because
it was working fine a second ago come on
come on sense it since the things
come on sensors laser beam me up huh
what come on what is this
okay the key component of steamvr isn't
working properly how weird it was
working fine a second ago
what is theis
let's try restarting steam then oh man
I'm already sweating ballsack and I
haven't even started playing the game
yet it's crazy it's also because I
usually have the AC running in here but
it's it's kind of noisy for you guys so
I turned it off I don't know why you're
all fapping together in chat but it's
very strange and maybe it's just my PC
this is I should also mention this is
the first time no this is the second
time I've streamed to this particular
system I was streaming to hotline when I
first got the vibe but for streaming and
stuff I decided to hook it up to the
same PC that we use for awesome hardware
which is airing tonight by the way
and that's the the silent night build
silent night PC is handling this at the
moment and it's totally equipped to do
it I did swap out the GTX 960 for a 980
TI so there's that
and if you hear that rumbling noise
that's the garage door opening
underneath me
look my grandpa's fiddling around in the
garage okay that looks good good
watching turn the controllers on battery
life on on the controllers is very good
I would say five to six hours of
straight game play and they recharge in
you know an hour and a half tops maybe
two maybe two hours but very impressed
with the with the battery life there
okay it looks like steamvr is working
now it's decided to work high CPU usage
detected let's see what we're running at
so we're at about yeah we're almost
maxed out here on the on this here CPU
usage so it looks like that's working
I'm gonna go ahead and let's get this
started
get this party started y'all we do very
strange way that you actually log in
here you have to look into the thing
boom boom boom and I should probably get
my headphones on headphones where are
you
headphones uh-huh alright come hipbones
I music let's go enter I forget now I
haven't figured out yet how to activate
the little camera so that I can actually
see without having to take my headphones
off or my headset off I should I should
have robably figured that out before the
stream but I really think about it but
is it black again wow that's really
weird
I have to keep refreshing it in exploit
just having a hard time processing it
okay so we're gonna go small Sparrow
looks great looks great let's go into
this one now it's four people
join ready so in about ten seconds maybe
I guess we're gonna jump it in here
pretty soon but the hell he's saying
alright put my headphones on how's it
looking on your end looks good back on
okay and my headphones are on my
freaking cheese so disoriented while I'm
waiting for that for a sec let me go
ahead and clean off these glasses cuz
they are they're all nasty now they're
all nasty Wow
I did I did preface this video by saying
that there would be tons of technical
difficulties and I'm so glad I did you
all you all can't say you didn't expect
it you weren't warned okay what's going
on why why is it just stuck at 10 see
here boom boom boom oh it's really hard
to do this without actually being ready
i readied up fool why the hell it's
doing that alright let's go ahead and
put this on
grab my hands boom boom all right I'm
gonna leave the lobby because the lobby
is being a dick right now let's try this
one
join this one's actually going down okay
and Who am I I am the robot I'm the
robot in the small sparrow hover craft
let me just make sure that this is gonna
blow it up for you guys okay it looks
like I'm in and you guys are seeing
things clearly alright I'm in there we
go alright so I've never been on this
map before it looks like we're in a
lagoon or something so this is kind of
like your multi-purpose tool it also
serves us like your engine key so you
use it you basically pull down the
trigger of the vibe and point it in
whatever direction you want to go and
the first time I ever did this I have my
body literally shifted forward to try to
counteract the balance as my mind was
convinced that it was actually moving
pretty fast speed on the surface but
it's a really weird sensation doing this
for the first time but you get you get
the hang of it pretty quickly should
probably pull out a gun I usually like
to go through revolvers Oh what am i
doing
this comes with loot I have loot in here
don't I so let me get the loot out this
is basically just stuff that I can put
as a wall of defense up in my ship I can
place it wherever I like this is kind of
a shitty job that I'm doing here but I
don't nothing I guess okay good that's
real was it later anyway gone out to
kick some ass
let's kick some ass alright looks like
some shits going down here oh oh
ha boy huh
damn it
all right I got kilt you got me if
someone's really good second second boom
Oh backpack guy he's kicking ass right
now
he's clearly played this more than I
have all right so there's also a loot
scattered around and it gives you it
gives you more shit like this like the
barriers that you can place on your
hovercraft as well as a little defensive
shields that you can actually hold and
move around looks like there's a guy
over here Oh where's ya oh this is the
guy that's really good where's yet
got him huh so yeah this this game made
me I'm super sore the other day after
playing it for like an hour straight
just my knees were completely wrecked
from all the crouching and stuff but now
what you need to do Wow all right good
oh wow you got me you got me good that
time whoever that was dizzy dizzy
Technicolor okay let's try to find some
loot for a sec take a step away from all
the chaos and hold on before we do that
how's the stream going stream still
going I'm a zhing amazing
Oh sky coming towards me the hell away
from me
I'm gonna go this way oh it's nobody got
over there oh he's coming to get me
he'll know shit
let's try to mess with this guy damn it
oh I got crossfire huh that's cool I
have four kills it's it's okay I guess
whew I am I'm getting a workout that's
for sure
I know it doesn't seem like much because
you know I'm kind of standing in one
little area but you are moving around
quite a bit and when you've got the
headset on plus the headphones and you
know you're moving your arms and stuff
it's uh can get pretty tiring though
it's just so fun you don't really mind
too much this guy oh I saw a wee bit to
the mag a little bit close right now
whoa where'd it go Oh shitty plate I
can't tell if he's joking me out if I'm
lagging I'm probably probably both
asshole what
hey all right
oh hello nice nice dizzy that stuff's
giving alright alright let's get the
hell out of here
it's really weird when you go over like
a little hill like when you change
elevation like when you're going like
this and you and you go down it really
messes with you it's cool feeling now I
see you guy over there I'm coming for
you coming for you
the hell
god I don't know if that counts
Oh too
oh shit that's that's game oh my
goodness okay so I got my KD was five
and four I got the second most kills
dizzy just raped everyone but I'm pretty
happy with that score they might hurt my
fourth time playing and you can see
those people here in the lobby you could
see their glasses and stuff you can do
other little gestures like you can give
them thumbs up like yeah thumbs up buddy
or you can flip them off
I have robot hands so it's kind of weird
but that guy's doing that hang loose
sign sure like that but go ahead and
check on the stream really quick to make
sure I keep thinking that I'm facing you
guys how's this how's this looking how's
this looking and sounding guys is
everything looking all right it looks it
looks good on from here it looks like
we're still streaming we have zero drop
frames which I'm happy about
alright cool let me let me take one
minute to clean the the headset here and
my glasses I'm dying of sweat but it's
so fun I can't I can't stop now I can't
stop I'm gonna do I'm gonna do at least
one more maybe maybe two more rounds see
what we can do here oh I'm already in
game mardian all right I just I just
remember that I didn't even like have
any limp last game so you do start off
with loops
yeah there huh uh-huh and a little guy
cool
can you put it in front no I don't think
he can all right it's just on the size
oh shit my god this guy's not put his
armor at all we love damn you this is a
Wiley here's a way anyone
it's moving around I'm hitting shit
there'll be some good gameplay video
shit the hell's this chick doing
Wow I cannot believe my coffee right
there beautiful damn shield and who else
who else wants to mess with this yeah
Oh Luke all right so there's loot here
and try to pick up the loot close it
like that use your tool opens it up oh I
got company hurry up hurry up what I put
this here no I cannot here I can put
that there and I can put this nowhere
here ha ha
okay oh just in time OOP
key the key
what I guess so all right most be going
hold on we're loot I don't even need to
look right now you kill people I must
kill everyone
yay all right is that a guy just like it
oh nice nice nice nice
all right doing pretty good how's my
first step not bad not bad
uh-uh
go this way oh shit bitch is that oh
there's a guy whoa whoa my screen just
went blue let's get a piece on hold on
hold on I'm seeing nothing I see blue
I'm blind
why is it all blue there's nothing but a
blue screen right now guys oh here we go
I think my headset must have lost
tracking at some point I might need to
reposition my cameras a bit I really
threw me off I can get it back though
now the crossfire
when they see olive blue again it's blue
I can't see anything
why why shit man out oh I'm getting so
raped getting still messed up right now
dudes I can't see anything
what's happen it's back it's back again
why isn't keep doing that move again
oh man this is not happening before I'm
thinking maybe it's um I haven't moved
the cameras or the sensors never so what
it's saying that these are not tracking
properly the lag is real come on guys
come on come on dudes this is bullshit
okay headset says it's connected but not
tracking and of course now it's working
handed but I go in somehow we put this
over here headphones
now
bitch it's just so weird oh do you see
when I put my hand over here my screen
goes blue
I just went blue I can't see anything
again okay
alright I'm gonna stand in the middle
and in front of the room very much
that's gonna be my strategy even then
the hell's going on so weird yeah yeah
man I'm sorry guys this would have been
more promising had at my tracking that's
not diet every minute or two it's really
unfortunate
see you Oh
kamikaze that shit
ten seconds all right
excuse me enough plane to do nothing
well I guess I still didn't do too bad
considering I was blind half the time
nineteen six have a feeling I would've
gotten closer to first place huh
oh yeah alright so I am still a little
too shows you how much experience I have
in this game yeah okay alright guys so
is it still watch this whole time I'm
not even streaming anymore oh cool you
know what um later up see you later I'm
gonna go ahead and try repositioning the
can't the sensors really quick I'm just
gonna give them a little exactly what
its gonna do
Matt okay you guys think it's a loose
cable I don't think it's a loose cable
because it was really it was really
happening a lot when I was moving my
controller out in front of me I think it
was in this area actually I completely
lost my bearings I don't know if I was
facing this way or somewhere else at the
time but um I just gave my my sensors a
little tweak
hopefully that fixes things we're gonna
do one more of these bad boys
whoa and see if that changes anything
and then I'm gonna shower and then burn
all my clothes that I'm wearing right
now all right what do you guys think so
far pretty cool right pretty cool okay
and my frickin headset is over there my
headphones in case you guys didn't know
the vibe has a built-in microphone so
you can VoIP and stuff without having
you use a microphone elsewhere like on
my SteelSeries headset here which is
pretty cool
let's go to view this one join
join join join ready fire it up let's do
some tracking testing so ok looks decent
I should really open this no no no no
shit are you coming from oh no man
and they have two dudes on that ship
that's not fair well I feel like such a
loser team deathmatch okay
stick them out one at a time
again okay you know I don't like the
team one so let's let's back out of the
teams cuz I don't think that's really a
good thing to show right now also I'm
getting my ass kicked
how the hell do I get out of here that's
one thing I never figured out how to do
is how to exit a game mid round but not
go to the oh quit quit match ha ha ha
really ok because it's got to people see
how it's got like to to people icons
there I think that means it's um two
person per ship max so we'll go to this
one ass xxx looks like more like a vr
porn server but I'm game
we'll give it a shot ah jeez hope I
didn't just butcher the stream right
there still going strong
alright
boom boom here's something I hear
something
it's um gonna itch in my eye it's not
good it's itchy oh shit
all right we've got company here haha
go back away
what
we're right
finally got killed all right not bad I
think seems to be a bit better in this
round I haven't gone this screen hasn't
gone blank
yet it's good look wow that was quick
yeah lone gunman he's pretty good well
lag Holy Mother of lag what's happening
got her she wasn't really doing much oh
it's like there's a gangbang going on
over here someone's getting initiated
let's try the shotty
quite as powerful as I thought wow what
if I would have knocked him out probably
in like two or three shells but seems
kind of bullet spongy to me let's do one
more shot it all tangled up in this mess
ah are you at bro what oh my god it
could also be because I'm suffering from
major lag another thing Wow okay
Oh
all right one minute to go already
jeez what the hell is going on over
there
you just spawn means that the like make
sure no one's sneaking up behind me Oh
God lone gunman you're a bastard eh
ah oh my god the lag is real yeah it's
probably maybe because I'm streaming
while playing a freaking VR game to
youtube but okay I didn't do so horribly
not as bad as Ino dudes not bad
considering I was lagging something oh
that hurt kind of actually it didn't
hurt it was just very Jory someone make
a gif of that pronto that was amazing um
okay let me just see if you guys are
actually still with me I don't know
where you guys are Oh
oh my god welcome back to reality Kyle
woo that's that's also a cool feeling is
when you finally take the headset off
after playing for like a good 45 minutes
to an hour plus you really feel like you
you are just teleporting back into
reality it's a really trippy feeling but
um damn guys I think if I play another
round I'm probably going to melt and
I'll just turn into a puddle right here
on the ground which would be very
exciting to see you however uh it's not
something I'm really into right now so
on that note I'm gonna close out this
video sorry for all the technical
difficulties but I really just I was
feeling pretty greedy just playing this
locked in my room and just enjoying the
vibe experience by myself and not really
sharing it with you guys so I'm really
glad I got to do this as off-the-cuff as
it was so hopefully you enjoyed it let
me know if you want to see more VR stuff
like this I know it's it's still
technology but it's not necessarily DIY
PC however I'm more than happy to make
as many VR videos as you guys want to
see so just let me know in the comments
feel free to test me like on the video
as well and I'll see you guys later
tonight for episode 61 of Awesome
hardware with Paul at Paul's hardware so
thank you guys so much this has been a
lot of fun I'm gonna go shower hope you
all have a good one peace now I gotta go
