we live are we now live are we nice
blink twice if we're live blink once is
your dad down tell us up we are
definitely live except right now we're
on the run that we're on that view no
one wants to see that view that looks
much better and actually we're not even
centered you scoot over a little bit to
your right uh-huh
we totally planned this out what's up
guys welcome back to the channel today
i'm joined by wifey sauce and we're
gonna be doing a quick little unboxing
of the gtx 1070 TI this one in
particular is from EVGA so they actually
sent this to me I didn't even realize
that they were sending me one until it
arrived at my doorstep this morning as
we were leaving the house to come to the
office and I thought hey I should
probably do an unboxing of this and lo
and behold today is actually the
unboxing embargo it's kind of silly that
they have know that they have embargoes
just for unboxings now really that's a
new thing that it's relatively new it
didn't I've never done one of these like
last year so apparently we can unbox it
we can show off the hardware itself but
we can't actually show any performance
so benchmarks are gonna have to wait
until the performance embargo lifts on
November 2nd which is a week from a week
from sometime around now November 2nd
it's about a week next week yeah so so
you guys are gonna have to sit tight for
the till then to actually get the scoop
on how fast this thing is or what kind
of thermals we're seeing but at the very
least we can take it out of the box and
be like ooh shiny pretty look at it's so
fancy and look it's a video card that
looks just like all the other EVGA cards
but it's still exciting them the less
because it's a new it's a new it's a new
graphics card kind of and it's still
using the same GP 104 GPU that we saw in
the regular gtx 1070 and the 1080
however i believe it has one disabled
cluster so we actually only have 20 432
cuda cores slightly cut down from the
GTX 1080 but still kind of high up
compared to the 1070 with like nineteen
hundred and something CUDA cores
so that's actually pretty nice but let's
let's stop yappin people want to see the
fricken the freakin product okay oh you
want to do it okay hold on first off we
got to change camera angles okay number
two and you're gonna go ahead and I know
how to open a box Kyle all right just
just making just making sure I don't
know I haven't I do all the unboxings no
that would be I mean that would be the
only way to top the cork incident with
would be if like you know wife stabs
husband on stream while opening up
graphics card box accident or not the
world may never know um but they know
you guys at home watching you know you
know how all right let's say it this is
exciting
okay all right first I'm gonna I'm gonna
really milk this because there's well
there's really not much content we can
provide for you guys other than our
stupid entertainment and and just
yapping yapping along she has a knife
down some EVGA likes to include posters
with their with their products so turn
that guy around superior hardware is
that a euphemism so looks like a like a
robot guy all right EVGA is like a movie
poster um not right now it's kind of
wrinkly we might need to iron it out of
it that's why I was never understood the
whole poster in the box thing you get it
out to me it's just got all these
creases right away but but hey maybe
maybe someone just wanted like one sixth
of that poster and they cut it out and
there was no creases at all and then
you've got and then we've got some some
documentation here your users guide
whoever reads a user's guide from a
graphics card I'm sure someone does and
then the stickers these are these are
nice stickers nice and big enthusiasts
built of course you get an EVGA badge
it's kind of you know be cool be fun to
do a video on how the badges have
changed over the years it probably
wouldn't but I was like but no one's
done it yet but there's probably
for that and then you also get what
looks to be looks like a four pin two
dual 6 pin PCI adapter beautiful crinkly
super crinkly is anyone complaining it's
about like you know camera feed or the
audio the exposure it's too exposed
is it really too exposed oh well that's
just because that's just because the
plastic is super reflective let me get
it out of its clamshell case that's your
way we're getting zebra lines yeah see
wait why is the camera showing zebra
lines on stream that's weird that's not
right let me go ahead and fix that
really quick wait give it a sec it looks
like they're sort of fixed on oh yeah
that's because it usually takes a couple
seconds to catch up alright zebras are
gone I apologize we did not mean to
bring wildlife into this but here we
have the graphics card now there's been
a lot of rumor and speculation I don't
know where this came from
but people were saying that the gtx 1070
TI would be unlockable which is now a
word that i just made up
that's not true it's already been
confirmed that you will be able to
overclock the gtx 1070 TI and i don't
know there might there might have been
some truth to the fact that nvidia might
have might have been like trying to get
ed board partners to settle down on
their factory overclock because you
wouldn't want nvidia for sure wouldn't
want a 1070 TI to outperform a gtx 1080
out of the box that would sort of
cannibalize it that would not be good
for them but you will be able to
overclock this guy in fact EVGA is
already working on the latest version of
their
Oh see scanner as Oh see scanner X and
precision XO see so that you can
basically do one-button overclocking so
instead of having to fiddle around with
you know your own your own hardware that
that sounds it sounds funny you should
just be able to click a single button in
precision X and it'll do it'll it'll
scan and detect the optimal overclock
for you but here's the card itself
I believe it's shipping with a base in
boost clock of 1607 1607 megahertz base
and sixteen hundred and eighty-three
boost respectively
and look at that it's got a dual dual
fan design this is rockin an AC X 3.0
cooler as we can see I actually really
like these EVGA cards they were very
polarizing when they first came out just
the style and stuff I'll always be a fan
and then we've also got a single 8-pin
connector this is actually a reference
connector so the reference design will
also be a pin very similar to the
existing gtx 1070 and 1080 so that's
great this is not I should for the
record it does not say anywhere on the
box that this is a super clock or
SuperDuper clock yeah I know that's not
correct or a for the win Edition so it
just looks like this is a standard gtx
1070 TI EVGA you know basic basic model
here but that's cool i would imagine
that your power requirements are gonna
go up as as the as the tier of graphics
card scales up as well oh I'm an idiot
because it says SC right there
I forgot that EVGA EVGA does that now so
this is a super clock but which is cool
that for a super clocked card you still
only have an 8-pin connector you do not
get a backplate but you know boohoo
aesthetics is aesthetics are just
aesthetics after all there is an SLI
connector two fingers there which
indicates that this is going to be
supported with 2-way SLI so you could
drop two of these guys back to back and
theoretically improve your performance
quite a bit of course we won't know
until November 2nd and then we've got
let's see looks like a heat sink and
stuff of course the heat sink looks
pretty nice looks like one two three
maybe four or five copper heat pipes
it's kind of hard to tell from here
why don't we why don't we correct this
guy open should we do that should we
crack him open honey I guess so I didn't
let me help you if you if you promise
not to break anything I promise I'm not
breaking I'll hold you personally liable
if if anything goes wrong three display
ports one HDMI and you get a dual link
DVI five video outs right there that's
pretty nice let's say let's take this
guy apart shall we hey I'm gonna zoom in
a little bit for you guys whoa whoa whoa
does that look a little better and I'm
gonna I'm also gonna like autofocus
they're crispy not really but someone
slap you we're getting there
don't do that no don't listen to them no
no see now now you've given in to their
demands only one only one yeah but you
given to one demand and then they all
put in their own they all put in their
own special request she'll never do
he'll never do it again she says I'm the
only one she listens to she said that's
true Who am I kidding
so let's go ahead and take this guy
apart really quick I'll be speedy about
it guys I know undoing screws isn't the
most riveting thing you've witnessed all
day my point exactly
I rest my case the entertainment value
of screwing well you know actually
depending there was no anti anti static
that was a good observation I have had
graphics cards come with without his
anti-static bag in the past I've never
had any issues with that how
I wouldn't be surprised if somebody out
there has there's always one person's
like mine didn't come with an
anti-static bag and when I open the box
it exploded in my face
but let's let's just hope this thing
boots when I finally get it on the test
bed what do you want to get demonetised
is that is that what you want for this
channel YouTube YouTube hates music and
I hate joy okay
you can't show them that you're enjoying
anything it'll come down and demolish
you
so let's undo these guys see this dude
Jacob said gave donated five dollars and
he said by yourself I make that a
magnetic screw slash tool holder which
we do have one actually yeah we do but
it's currently filled with screws as it
should be but we can definitely use more
of them so thank you for that donation
Andrew Jacob Jacob Jacob Andrew yeah
there I'm sure there's a Jacobin Andrew
related some it doesn't matter thank you
thank you
Thank You Jacob I love you alright we're
just about ready here alrighty alrighty
wait
I think this guy can come off now oh ha
ha ha ha ha so we do have a couple
cables that we need to unplug really
quick there's this guy which I believe
these are both for the fans there's this
one boom that is for okay so this plug
right here is for both of the fans we've
got a dual fan design which this plugs
responsible for and then guessing this
one is for our LED because the faceplate
right here
theoretically lights up perhaps in white
once the unit's powered up I'm gonna
unplug that whoo there we go and here we
have a beautiful shot of our sort of our
base plate here and the heat sink the
underbelly of it all go in full tear
down here looks like an appropriate
amount of thermal paste was applied you
can see our power delivery right here
it's a five five phase power that we're
dealing with all righty
so I was wrong it's actually three
copper heat pipes but they seem to be
fairly fairly wide fairly wide fins
aren't too dense or anything this is not
an icy X card by any means so you're not
getting some of those additional
features there's no like you know MCU
sensors you only get one sensor on the
GPU and let's go ahead and wipe that
wipe that Tim off Tim so we can get a
nicer a nicer look at the dye itself
what are you doing over there some
reason I can't leave vomits right now
it's weird but just in case anyone's
wondering you can send a super chat by
clicking the little money sign in chat
yes I I brought life sauce on to this
stream so she could Panhandle and beg
you guys for money not true yep you're
doing a great job honey keep keep asking
them for money make sure that they know
all the ways to do back what yeah is it
because of this that's cuz of the copper
well you know what I'm movin it right
here for now
lean it against the cup of cup of scotch
there which looks great
alright so base plate comes right off
and look at that we've got a pretty nice
coverage of thermal pads so you got
thermal pads over here for definitely
our memory some of our power delivery
looks pretty nice looks purty Ananas and
let me give you guys a close-up look
here we try to position the camera and
I'm gonna though I don't focus do right
there last yes you did it correctly you
gonna do five dollars thank you last
thanks appreciate it man
all right well we should have some fun
with this guy guys let me know and chat
what kind of benchmarks you'd like to
see I'm definitely gonna be comparing it
to the gtx 1070 and the 1080 I think
that's a given I think a lot of
reviewers are gonna do the same and the
other thing that I'd like to compare
this to is RX Vega 56 I have a feeling
that's why this card even exists I feel
like it's sort of invidious response to
that card because as we've seen even in
my own testing the RX Vega 56 does pull
ahead of the gtx 1070 in certain titles
under certain configurations and such so
you know nvidia has definitely got a lot
of silicon probably left to spare and
then factories and they're probably you
know we can make a new SKU out of this
same same silicon and all that but you
know hashtag marketing and all that but
there it is folks that's that's our gtx
1070 TI super clock edition from EVGA
fully nude fully fully nude in the flesh
guys so um let's see if you guys have
any last-minute questions oh I should
mention price EVGA told me that I could
mention the price of their card here
which is gonna be four hundred and sixty
nine ninety nine and if we look at the
pricing for the GTX 1017 ten eighty ten
70s going for about four hundred and ten
bucks for between 410 and 420 I did see
a 410 dollar gtx 1070 on Newegg like
right before we started streaming so
that's on the low end that's on the
cheap end is you can get a 1070 for 410
GTX 1080 a little bit more than that 560
was the cheapest when I saw between
Amazon and Newegg so this is pretty much
smack-dab in the middle at four hundred
and seventy bucks if we can overclock
this guy and get within three to five
percent of whatever the GTX 1080
whatever the 1080 can pull I'm thinking
this is gonna be a pretty good bargain
but of course there's also other things
to consider like I'm sure thermals
aren't going to be a problem I believe
this card has a the same tbp as the GTX
1080 at 180 watts so that's not much of
a concern either but if there any other
last-minute questions everyone's just
everyone's just saying everyone's just
saying 69 in chat yeah because because
of the price $169 you can't possibly put
all the people who say 69 in chat
timeout someone someone said 420 blaze
it make him a moderator no okay well not
all right I tried I tried 420 blazeit
guy I tried no we cannot benchmark I
will not run minecraft
why do I even ask you guys to ask
questions you're all useless you're all
dead to me no
you guys look at now oh you know what
there was a question or something that I
caught just briefly about floatplane
somebody asked me about float plane
which is LTTE or Linus tech tips --is
new platform that is kind of like paid
YouTube in a sense it's kind of like
vessel in a way the guys over there
might might hate me for saying that but
in a nutshell just to explain it quickly
you can go over to their platform once
it launches later this year and get a
lot of cool benefits that you don't have
on YouTube and a lot of your favorite
creators will eventually be there
perhaps myself included in fact you guys
heard it here first I'm allowed to say
this Linus knows I am allowed to say
this this is impromptu announcement
impromptu announcement there will be an
official video on this later this month
but bit wit the YouTube channel is the
first channel to be officially partnered
with Linus tech tips float plane Club
also we will actually be the first
channel up on their site when it
officially launches whenever with
whatever Linus to Luke get their
together honestly know it should be a
lot of fun I'm super honored to be on
board and to essentially be the guinea
pig
this platform I'm also kind of terrified
but it should be a lot of fun and I hope
you guys really enjoy it we're gonna
have some really cool incentives for you
guys there they've already shown me a
lot of the like the web pages in the
layout and it looks fabulous it looks it
really looks great the video player
looks great too so there'll be more
details coming soon Oh half a says how
about benchmarks with disasters Creed
origins
that's a good question jefe um I don't
have that game I don't think I hope that
game is in my library so I don't know if
I'll have time to purchase and download
it but I do have a pretty nice suite of
existing games that I like to run for
benchmarks that usually show GPU
performance adequately which I'll
probably resort to for this for this
video we
they have about a week to do all of our
testing and and shoot the damn thing so
but yeah doesn't good question five
dollars from an old gaming thanks NL I
appreciate it I honestly it was not Burt
I had a Caesar salad it's probably the
Caesar garlic authentic anchovies
dressing so that's probably you're
getting like you know a dead fish that
lingered inside of my stomach acid for
too long it's strong they're like turn
your head away or something like do you
have some scotch well guys this was
supposed to be a pretty short stream
because it's Friday evening you guys get
on with whatever plans you had come on
what am I talking about
we're all nerds we don't have plans we
don't have plans after this we're
probably gonna go home and just do 0 or
continue working
alright so wifey sauce has very popular
lifestyle very important and lots of
things to do and she knows people but
I'm literally gonna go home and just
chill oh we have to watch stranger
things oh my god stranger there's
everyone go home and watch stranger
things it's gonna be awesome
so guys here food salad couch it is
chill that's why I married you um so
guys thank you so much for tuning in and
we'll be seeing you guys very shortly a
new video going up on ultra in a couple
hours and a new video on the main
channel right here on bit wit goes up
tomorrow stack attack stack attack
episode true and then after that is the
evil build which is yeah epic AF bros so
guys thanks a lot have a good one boy I
didn't show you how to shut down the
stream yet did I okay I'm gonna have to
accurately do it this is one of those
things where it's like this we're like
everyone you know when you're like
hanging out with friends and you all say
goodbye and like hug but then like you
forgot something so you have to go back
to their house but hey I forgot my keys
and it's like really awkward like wait
do we hug and happy thing okay I'm just
gonna uncut</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
