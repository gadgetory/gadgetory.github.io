it's just like the first five minutes of
every stream just like it's like when
you go to when you wrote the orchestra
and they're all down in the orchestra
pit just making all those horrible
sounds at the beginning and it confident
yeah we'll just do that but with our
voices that at the beginning and that's
that'll be our grabbers that'll be what
people see and they're like I want to
watch more of this whatever that is more
I need that in my lot more of it good
shit that's my thought yep
all right guys welcome to awesome
Hardware episode 137 this is side B we
just got done stream inside a on Paul's
channel if you're watching this on the
youtubes you can go ahead and check out
youtube.com slash Paul's hardware or you
can follow the link in my video
description below if you're watching us
on Twitch just stay where you are twitch
you're lovely both of you guys are
lovely and it's gonna be an awesome show
it's gonna be an awesome continuation of
the first half of the show where are we
talking about with some tech news we're
gonna be doing some pin mop piece see I
kind of set it up for you guys earlier
but yeah we like to have fun and
occasionally have a beer or three or
four and if you are of legal drinking
age we'd love for you to drink with us
it's always fun cheers to our happily
though you have to we don't want you to
feel pressured no you have to just drink
it just be a man and drink it I mean you
don't get ya if you hang out with the
cool kids all we're all about peer
pressure here I think they're forcing
you to do things you feel uncomfortable
about um that's not true at all today's
theme occasionally we will say words
like hey your life like hey your life or
words like again a notification I got in
to get a notification when my video went
live I don't know what's weird lame its
YouTube being racist somehow will swear
in the show not like a gratuitous amount
profanity sometimes it gets cartoons
only when warranted yeah of course we
pick our battles strategically and the
words we say so if you have little ones
around I mean you know make sure to
throw them in the pool or something
and what else you should check out our
stores we sell stuff on bit with tech
slash store and you can you can buy mugs
glasses decals mouse pads crystal RGB
shirt still on sale for $14 sure is
mouse pads yep the new mugs are nice a
lot of awesome hardware merch RGB
everything sure it beware of bottleneck
shirt BIOS flasher fidget spinners are
still there we have about five or six
left so we're trying to clear that out
so we can make room for new products you
can buy two at a time you can buy two
you could buy they'll let the remaining
five if you buy the remaining five all
you can't do that because it only lets
you select one or two I guess you could
do a quantity two and then edit twice
and add all these edit edit two or three
times so that's my store pol also sells
it's on a three of that I am available
see told you there's only like what an
intelligent web store we have good ol
Squarespace Paul's site is Paul's
hardware dotnet sells shirts and hoodies
and mouse pads and mugs and glasses and
decals and bottle openers and a bunch of
other good key caps so many so many good
things so many good things everywhere we
will shush out Johnson at you at the end
of the show if you happen to pick
anything up from either of our stores a
double Johnson if you get something from
both of our stores and that's how that
works
so I think with that said we can jump
right into more tech news starting with
an article from overclocked 3d net which
shows us good news some leaked images of
some new rising Vega CPUs Rison and Vega
combined these are the the AP use I
would I'm gonna call them ap use because
that's the calls of what they are I feel
like like when we were at the press
event though they refrain from using the
term ap you at all and I was like is
this a marketing thing are they trying
to stray away from that because it just
seemed like a really easy acronym really
easy thing to say and I didn't hear
anyone say it once they just are they
facing
are they phasing out that branding
that's what it seemed like to me and I
was like I don't care I don't give a
shit I'm gonna keep calling an AP use
because it makes sense but I didn't hear
them say once during the whole eight
hour whatever
find our press event anyway I don't mind
APU I but it's not it doesn't like it
doesn't apply to Intel right because
there's AMD thing even though it's not
really brand centric it's accelerated
processing unit which doesn't mean
anything it just what it's the name that
agencies made at a and yeah before a CPU
with an integrated graphics right it's
like hyper threading versus SMT yeah
sure yeah I agree I agree with that but
AMD fit at least continue using their
own acronym so these are leaked images
from the Chinese forum Baidu which we
have seen many leaked things come from
there in the past and it's about the to
these skews here they're meant the
mention right there the rising 320 200 G
in the rising 520 400 G these are I
believe 65 watt parts and they have
integrated
Faga graphics on them 2200 G says 45 to
65 watt so that's ok probably it hasn't
been confirmed sure or that's impressive
I don't know this overclocking states
that that might affect the TDP but not
but I'll probably have a static TDP I
feel like yeah it's I would think so but
these are exciting chips it's the first
ApS we've seen from AMD in a long time
the first one's ever to feature the rise
in Zen's and architecture this is I
should specify this as a rise in first
generation stuff we're still on 14
nanometer here we are not doing the rise
in second gen CPUs so we're still kind
of like tapping into the the surplus of
Rison first gen cpu that they have just
combining that with integrated Vega
graphics those are 14 nanometre
precision boosts to however you will get
which is going to be something that's
featured on rising second-generation so
there is a bit of rising rising to
features and qualities that you'll get
from these ap use the memory controllers
have been refined so this was actually a
huge issue with first gen risin is that
the memory controllers weren't optimized
to their fullest so you couldn't
actually have really high speed memory
in a lot of cases running with our eyes
platform which did dampen the the gaming
performance for example with the
Infinity fabric integration so that's
all been refined to support higher DRAM
frequencies which is excellent it's
fully overclockable not just the cpu
portion but the GPU side of the of the
apu as well are fully unlocked so you
can get some pretty nice gains they were
showing us some some pretty nice
farik numbers correctly the GPU runs at
1250 megahertz
by default and they did some
overclocking with us two demos at the
CES tech day where they were pushing it
to 1400 1450 which yeah that's pretty
huge got them a nice nice performance
boost that's really nice on an APU and
of course you know the Vega graphics
here are just gonna absolutely crush
Intel and their integrated graphics it's
gonna be a great option I think for
super budget gamers or even gamers who
want to have a higher end experience but
don't have the money to fork out on a
discrete GPU right now because the
prices are so screwed but hey I mean
there's still a bunch of a.m. for
motherboards out right now that have
display video outs and and things like
that where you could pop one of these in
there these are going to be backwards
compatible with existing a and for
motherboards where you could do some
light gaming on these I mean granted
it's like maybe the prettiest thing
you've ever seen or the the most smooth
playback that you've seen but again
it'll blow in telling the grete graphics
out of the water and get a lot of users
I'm sure a temporary solution for PC
gaming until GPU prices either come down
or until you're able to find you know
luck of the draw GPU that's reasonably
priced anyone who's trying to save up
just enough money to build a gaming PC
right now but like obviously has no
choice when it comes to a graphics card
just because they're also overpriced
yeah this is a great entry choice that
will let you play games at you know 10
80 and maybe you can't crank up the
settings to max or anything but Polly
can play about medium and low and he can
still play that's not ideal but you can
still build a gaming PC and then
hopefully hang out for a couple months
then graphics card prices come down
hopefully they will at some point and
then you can drop a GPU in it
and you're still good to go yeah and the
nice thing about these chips is that you
know even if you already had a let's say
you already had a discrete GPU they're
pricing these pretty similar to first
gen Rison but you're getting that bonus
integrated graphics feature with Vega so
that which is good for like
troubleshooting in stuff it's nice to
have an integrated GPU sometimes even if
you do have a discrete graphics solution
and there are also promising higher
clock speeds out of the box so similar
price as rise in one but you're getting
a lot more for your money at the same
time so that's exciting as well and you
know these pictures are obviously taken
from just some random person on the
internet so take that with a grain of
salt but it looks it looks fairly legit
from whatever we can tell the same
Wraiths though the Wraiths stealth that
comes included with both of these chips
is also being featured here in these
link pictures and it looks pretty much
to have the same design as the existing
wraith stealth not much has changed here
not really any reason for it to doesn't
need to get bulked up because these
tvp's are about the same or even lower
potentially than the last generation of
verizon so good stuff all around looks
like you know China is already getting
these we're pretty much on we should be
on track to see these on their release
date February 12 cool sweet moving on
there's I'm just gonna go through this
article quickly cuz you know it's it's
kind of kind of thick in some areas but
basically the feds have shut down a six
hundred million dollar cryptocurrency
scam or they believe to be as a scams
from Ars Technica the SEC Securities and
Exchange Commission they just shut down
an initial coin offering for a
cryptocurrency project called arise Bank
arise Bank claims to have raised six
hundred million dollars for the project
although this was never confirmed by the
SEC this arise Bank project was also
endorsed strangely enough by boxer
Evander Holyfield earlier this month
which he's my go-to when it comes to
cryptocurrency absolutely I trust
anything he says on that topic in
particular sure he's an expert SEC says
the ICO or initial coin offering wasn't
registered with the agency and the
founders of the project have have made
at least two fraudulent claims as it
sold its new cryptocurrency so these
guys are a little sketchy to begin with
the people who are operating this whole
thing
the SEC basically what this means is the
SEC is cracking down on the sort of
crypto projects that have red flags of
being a potential cyber scam to
thousands of people one of the founders
for example jared rice was charged in
2015 with a felony theft and tampering
with government records on top of other
accusations of fraud tampering with
government records that seems like like
you're definitely up to something
tampering with government records and
stuff that's unique but if you just
found some errors and he wanted to
correct them sure maybe he has OCD that
could be it was just very high attention
to detail this guy can can't jump to
conclusions it was just a random typo on
something the project revolved around
its digital currency called a rise coin
they also had an identification platform
called a rise ID an operating system
called arise OS there were there were no
signs really that the project had a
substantial following there was only
about 45 subscribers on there their
subreddit their rise banks I've read it
some other red flags include the fact
that they claim to be working with a
financial tech company called marquetta
to enable payments that would allow
users to to use the visa network to make
payments but marquetta upon learning
about this claim by a rise bank
completely denied it and said we have no
idea we're not working with them at all
and some other just shady things I'm not
going to get too much into detail here
but this was a texas-based company
texas-based project and texas regulators
have already ordered a rise bank to
cease claiming itself as a bank and to
avoid doing business in Texas so
basically saying just shut your
operations down you are most
definitely a cryptocurrency scam and we
don't want you doing business anymore in
Texas is usually so business friendly
yeah and they certainly are and so it's
definitely saying a lot there so just
guys be careful you know this is
uncharted territory a lot of this crypto
mining stuff if you go if you are gonna
be investing time or money specifically
into the whole mining world just be
careful make sure you do a lot of
research don't take everything just for
truth and yeah stay safe out there the
Internet can be a scary place especially
when a lots of money is and potential
for making money is involved but moving
on here this is an article was kind of
circling back to Newegg actually it's
funny cuz I was actually gonna talk
about this I put a note on my site yeah
I mentioned this it didn't much forget
or I just forgot because I I got the
emails about this from knew I could fill
it cuz I joined the new affiliate
program background Black Friday and I
still don't linked to anything there but
I just joined I was like well I might as
well have this set up so I got the
emails about this but yeah so so so
basically this is an article from
hardware and essentially in a nutshell
we'll go over this quickly Newegg is
cutting off their their GPU category for
their affiliate program so if you were a
new egg affiliate and you were let's say
some sort of reviewer or an influencer
online who you know was promoting
products and getting a kickback for any
to any time you would refer a new egg
product to your viewers and they would
buy it
GPUs are now excluded from that program
entirely when it comes to new egg and
they issued a statement saying you know
basically Bitcoin mining has gone
mainstream it's literally a quote that
they said and the limited nature of
these cards has caused a shortage in
which supply can never meet demand and
thus many users are actively buying
these cards as soon as they get in stock
so this means effective in seven days
from now all vga cards will be marked
non commissionable for the foreseeable
future on all business units so if you
were a huge if you were hugely a user of
the Amazon I'm sorry the Newegg
affiliate program you can now no longer
make
any affiliate money or commission off of
graphics cards anything the VGA category
is off-limits because they simply just
can't meet demand and you know they're
probably well because I say you say
because they're but like this is this is
this is my this is my kind of irritation
with them right so I got the Commission
Junction advertiser update here which
has all of their existing terms their
existing terms for new customers for
train customers everything like that and
basically Commission with new egg is
about usually about one to two percent
it's not that fantastic Amazon is much
better when it comes to Commission
that's provided but they have exclusions
listed which includes actually doesn't
include Apple products video game
consoles and they have an item list
called loss leaders so basically if it's
a loss leader if they're already losing
money on the product which means the
salient really cheap just to get people
to come to the website and buy stuff
you're not going to make you Commission
on that so all these lists all these are
so these lists and then they're updated
terms which is basically everything
exactly the same but 0 USD Commission on
item list VGA 0 USD item on item list
video cards because new a glice likes to
have two separate lists for VGA and
video cards because item maintain is a
piece of crap but never mind about any
of that point is the initial email they
sent out about this which I was trying
to pull up here because I had it but
they sent an email about this which
lists like Kyle was saying like oh you
know they're just selling so well and
everything so blah blah and it's like bs
like absolute BS i know they have to say
something in the email to be like here's
why we're doing this or whatever but
just bullshit right yeah these cards are
flying off the sell off the shelves we
have no need to pay you any Commission
for them for referencing sales to our
website right that's what they're saying
yeah there's nothing in there but like
oh they're selling
first so quickly so just we can't it's
too quick we can't calculate the
commission for you guys because they're
selling so fast or whatever no like no
oh these cards are suddenly selling for
twice as much as the MSRP so it's just
really hard to cut you guys in on the
margin no yeah they're making double the
margin if not more than that right
they're just being like look we don't
need your help selling these so we're
not gonna pay you for it that's right
that's that's what it boils down to yep
so in a nutshell these GPUs are selling
themselves right exactly yes so we're
not gonna lose any money off of you
trying to push him
it sucks for affiliates it does I mean
yeah and like you said like the payout
for new egg is so small anyway to begin
with 1 2 % it's like ever been thanked
some people a lot of people are I'm sure
there are a lot of creators out there
publishers whatever journalists that are
relying on their affiliate sales to some
degree and yeah that's just kind of its
kind of shitty just another way that the
situation's just screwing people over
it's freaking crazy man but hopefully
know you guys are affected too badly by
that but we can move on here because we
have some additional stuff to cover this
is the last article from tech news the
tech news segment about Dell considering
to sell or considering this sell a sale
really to VMware in what may be the tech
industry's biggest deal ever
I guess steel ever um so basically Dell
right now or merger yeah it's a reverse
merger because right now Dell owns about
80% let's reverse herpes kind of but it
stays with you even more than that
around it's like ghost turkeys so um
right now Dell owns 80% of vmware but
now vmware might actually buy Dell the
reason why that might happen is by doing
that it would allow Dell to be traded
publicly because right now they're a
private company and so a VMware bought
Dell they'd be traded publicly without
having to go through a formal listing it
would also be
obviously like I said the biggest deal
ever in the history of tech giving the
investors who backed Dells move to go
private back in 2013 a way to sort of
monetize their deal while helping Dell
to pay off some of its 50 billion dollar
debt I should mention this article is
from CNBC thank you guys very much
so yeah 15 to 50 billion dollars in debt
I'm sure that has a lot to factor in
this shit out what do we do this reverse
merger here now that is to say that you
know Dell still could go with a more
traditional IPO but the reverse merger
would let the company dodge yet another
public offering the board the Dells
board will meet next month to explore
all the various options and it's still
unclear what the exact valuation of Dell
as a company is because they are private
so there's no real way of knowing but it
did take itself private in a 24 billion
dollar deal in 2013 before acquiring EMC
for 67 billion dollars or so which was
at the time the largest tech acquisition
ever Fernet and it will be it still is
for now if this reverse merger happens I
I would imagine it's gonna be a lot more
than 67 billion which is a lot of a lot
of billions many many billions many
billions of dollars so who in who's to
say what that would do for Dell as a
company as a hardware manufacturer you
know is it you know are they still gonna
make same quality products well that
change is is alien we're still gonna
suck we don't know so you know this is
also say that big big money big money in
the tech industry might be floating
around and that could potentially change
some things so when you look at all the
like system integrator companies and
whatever especially the ones that were
around in like the late 90s and 2000's
like Dell still around there's logic
there's lots of other examples of
companies that have faded out you know
totally bit the dust
as as times have progressed but right
yeah like I just my wife's my wife's
Dell monitor that I got her she really
likes that yeah
43 inch and they still make a killing
off of their uh their pre belts and
stuff yeah but that's all for strict
tech news for now and we can move on to
our next segment which is pimp mop
please look I have lower thirds for it
whoo yeah are prepared af brah to some
degree hell yeah
this is where you guys send in pictures
of your rigs and pollen I'm Aki for it
while also trying to give you some
constructive criticism
starting with dick Oh his name isn't dad
' it's difficult to birds he's foreign
he's a foreigner 10 white Dan liked a
very very white name haha he's gonna
rise in five 1600 with an R X 588
gigabyte model that's expensive now 16
gigabytes of ddr4 Samsung 850 500 gig
SSD 2 terabyte Louisville and NZXT s340
alright so let's help dad out here the
first thing I'm gonna say is ketchup and
mustard because my eyes are immediately
drawn to that 24 pen ATX cable right
there yet which is cancerous to the enth
degree dan get yourself some sleeved
extensions maybe black would do good
because it looks like you've got a lot
of black going on here you can even do
black blue you've got a single PCI
Express power connector here I believe
that's a 6 pin what's our excit default
have six or eight four all right for
what I meant I was I was thinking about
Rose I was like a pimper rush yeah okay
four and four
anyway that would solve your problem
here repent fact that you've got a daisy
chain PCI Express power cable with the
extra nubs hanging off there right it
doesn't look that great so that would
solve that problem too other than that
your cable management is pretty tight
okay
your if you're going all out you can
match you match you the fans a little
bit more you've got a couple LED fans in
the
I'm an LED fans yeah but make them all
LEDs or make none of em LEDs I guess ya
would be my my choice then to for birdie
is your friend finally you got a clear
mastery what I believe is a hyper 212
which is a very solid and perfectly
adequate CPU cooler but in this type of
build that's the thing that's standing
out a little bit just slightly less than
that than the ketchup and mustard cables
as not not the prettiest yeah you know
there's other options in the 30 to 50
dollar range when it comes to air
coolers it might look a little bit nicer
if you decided to upgrade that
definitely but again only for aesthetics
right functionally your high pitch is
what was too loose oh yeah
we're very much emphasizing the pimp
aspect of all this Santiago thanks Dan
Santiago yeah the core i5 7400 and gtx
1070 with ace districts let's see you've
got a good bite z170 XP sli motherboard
a master box 5t planning on moving to an
i7 7700 K and a IO maybe a Kraken x64
potentially thrown a two eighty
millimeter rat in there okay what do we
got here Oh interesting um a lot of
stuff going on it seems that's a GPU
support I believe so why is that yeah
MMD custom very pretty positive that's
that is custom made I can't I can't
mouse over it because it pops up the
damn thing yeah I see because it's
screwed into the other yeah turn into
the PCIe slots and it's it's half
decorative haven't laughs well I guess
mainly for something asus would've made
probably not I'm guessing it's either 3d
printed or maybe there's some small
shops that does it or something I think
it looks fine it's a little rough the
finish looks a little rough on it but
yeah but it's key it's preventing GPU
sag and I will always approve of that
sure beyond that you're definitely 100
percent accurate when it comes to next
potential upgrade swapping out your
stock CPU cooler for something nicer
would be
nice yeah bear in mind though that you
don't have another claw Keable cpu so
dropping say a hundred and fifty dollars
or so like a crack at like a crack in it
would cost you I feel like would be a
little overkill boy yeah but he was
considering it for the East 77th oh okay
oh yeah yep if you upgrade your CPU as
well then then yeah go for it something
like that beyond that if you want to
keep your CPU if you're fine with the
performance then something like a
reasonable 35 to 50 ish dollar air
cooler might make things I want to get
cooler a little bit quieter and look
look a lot nicer yeah so something like
an enter max a TST 40s or Claire rig
each 77 or what else be quiet quiet
let's let's be quiet um a more slightly
budgeted would be like the slim rock or
shadow rock shadow rock slim slim
something like that yeah so one of those
I go with one of those you know but
definitely if if you drop a 7700 K in
there than the Kraken X 62 would be
would be a very nice pairing to go along
with that yeah it's a mansion set up to
get some more matchy-matchy fans in
their eyes that I'd love to see you get
the computer up off the ground or at
least even if it's not on the grounds a
little bit higher up than that you've
got some I don't know how much space you
have just getting it a good you know
1218 inches up off the floor I always
recommend it if possible but it doesn't
look like you have a whole lot of space
to work with there so but yeah nice
clean build overall you got the
accessories in the case and everything
looks really nice just that see people
who are upgrade yeah thank Santiago next
up we have mr. mark no simple silicon
simple silicon um let's see mine and
stream so he's clearly mining and
streaming with this system again we're
sort of suffering with with that you
know Intel stock cooler computer off
floor doesn't look like there any specs
attached here so we kind of just have to
sort of guess on the CPU looks like
probably a you know as easy
to 70 based chip or something like that
MSI motherboard GTX 1080i I don't know
what AIB that is maybe pay late or
something like that it's their memory
installed dude there's tons of just tons
of is this like a single stick of memory
is that am i seeing a single stick of
memory there it looks like there might
be like oh maybe you're right I'm yeah
yeah like this either no memory or a
single I think I think you're right I
think it's just one stick yeah so you
know maybe upgrade to some dual-channel
Ram that would help you with the
streaming and and other things in
general queue management insane it's
really bad it's really really really bad
it looks like you i I don't know like
this is a modular power supply so I
can't imagine what all these cables are
doing up in here there's he hasn't
really he has a fairly high end power
supply for a fairly budget case yeah an
HX 5 minutes it's a nice parcel but like
look what you got 2 drives here and an
optical drive I just I'd why are all
these cables right here it's like he
thought he had to plug them all in maybe
like Oh full e modular I guess I gotta
like fill them all up no it's the
opposite of what you want to do with a
full power supply so this once this
wants a complete recap job and I don't
know if you have any behind the
motherboard options here but but please
take advantage of them if you do if not
like you've got some space down here at
the bottom just take all your excess and
just tie them all up down here at the
bottom and then beyond that like reduce
some of these cables you got lots of
just kind of loose floppy cables
everywhere you know it's not looking
very also redo your floor and your
carpet flooring the crack just looks
like a bomb went off like what happened
is some stuff over here in the corner
did like did you get swatted and did
they like break things
it looks like was there there's that
blood on the floor it's like clean the
place like that's also why the case and
the system overall probably looks
a little bit shoddy this might be blood
that my view that's probably a blood
stain okay or worse yeah some help in
that department I think that looks like
you know
a life decision that needs to be made
not just for your system but for your
own well-being but simple silicon we
wish you the best
I hope our recommendations have helped
you yes thank you for the picture Mark
Stephens Thermaltake Corp III based
system rise in 1700 x EVGA 16 gigs EVGA
memory is that another thing Yugi all
right
I mean sure or sk5 motherboard a micron
I'm 600m Natsu SSD thermal take the
tough power RGB 650 watt power supply a
GTX 1078 100 IV to coolermaster with RGB
fans k 65 RGB m65 RGB so many RGB things
boy the Yellow Jackets alright so void
wait wait let's go yellow just little
voices the Yellow Jacket RGB boy just is
that the corsair void oh yeah ok
probably ok so he's got figurines and
stuff in here so um no it's like your
ear down looks like you're down with the
sort of mismatched colors I wouldn't say
mismatched but it looks like you've got
a 2-tone thing going on here you've got
that sort of hot pink in one picture you
have green LEDs on the motherboard and
two power supply but red LEDs on your
radiator fan and then another cycling
they're cycling through our RGB scheme
or something essentially yeah because in
the next video or a picture sorry
the colors are completely swapped where
you have pink LEDs on the motherboard
and power supply and green on the
radiator fans so maybe you're just
switching between those two that seems
better than this one and this one isn't
blues blue so I'm guessing it's just RGB
in it's cycling sure which is fine
totally fine it seems like the rest
that's fine because the rest of your
components seem to be color neutral
anyway yeah right but what pisses me off
about this thermaltake RGB power supply
is not the fact
that it has RGB lighting but the fact
that the PCIe connectors are red yeah
that's stupid
why if you're gonna make up thermaltake
has had red PCIe connector is on so many
other power supplies for way too long
and it's stupid I know it's really
stupid it's very triggering I don't know
what to do but if you if you have a pin
extractor you can get us you can get a
different PCIe connector extract the
pins and swap them yeah I mean it's or
just get some clean extensions and you
solve two problems with one yeah two
goes to to a data birds with one stone
so to speak I do like to ate ate a bird
I think it's yeah I like it something
like the bird add some flare for the
dude guy will do neither it's slightly
different than my doom guy my doom guy
is
I like the controller assortment things
going up front you get the PlayStation
and then in Nintendo yeah giving some
love to the rec room but yep thanks mark
thank you Mark you're good sir
next up we've got Oliver Olli there holy
Viera Zeon built all right X 56 50
overclocked to 4 gigahertz GTX 1050
overclocked to 1962 megahertz 16 gigs of
generic with stars
jun'er generic love that Randy loved
that brand gear by x58 USB 3 motherboard
paper to 12x and NZXT century fan
controller 3d printed power supply
shroud and CX 430 power supply 2
terabyte Seagate hard drive and a 100
kick generic he really likes the generic
labels do we know oh it's a fractal this
is interesting is that a duct tape power
supply basement no it's 3d printed I
would sweet but it's a 3d printed power
supply shroud
oh yeah three frames do you even said it
sorry
what is that cable coming out of it for
though what there's a that's like a
power cable it's going to do some card
going to an expansion card maybe that's
a magic card maybe it might be USB 3
I've seen USB 3
expansion cards that require an extra BR
connector and that would be a reasonable
upgrade for an ex 58 system because you
don't have any oh sorry us Matt Sorum
that so that's my guest there all right
Christian yeah definitely a fractal case
this is a this one is this one of the
arcs
it's my P an art you might be right
haven't seen this case in a while kind
of just like disoriented right so the
thing about this system that struck me
upon reading the specs was it's an ex
5650 Xeon which is overclocked decent
amount of memory not a super high part
graphics card CX 430 power supply just
seems seems like the lowest and lowest
common denominator like it's it's
adequate it's getting the job done but a
DES and any higher end graphics card
here and I feel like the CX 430 becomes
this limiting I don't know how much
power draw that Xeon processor has that
you'd be dealing with there but
aesthetically the cable management is
very clean all things considered you
know you've got some ketchup and mustard
there but there's not a lot of excess
cable that's just hanging out
unnecessarily the cables that you can
see seem to be in the locations that
they're in because that's the only
option that you had right especially
when it comes to your expansion card
that's down at the bottom power supply
shroud that's 3d printed I'm really why
not play yeah why is it a black it's and
it's all still lines you can see this
sort of like you can see the alignment
and that down see why there's like
airflow consideration there but it's on
the top but you know power supply fan is
facing up but it's not I don't know it's
confusing that's Kim it confuses me I
don't know what to say about it seems
kind of pointless yeah it doesn't seem
like it's doing a whole lot I mean I
guess if you got a bunch of ugly cables
coming out of the Pirates play right
there that's probably the main reason he
did it
I feel like to cover those if you could
bundle those cables
and zip-tie them like neatly it would be
less distracting then that then the
power supply shroud but you've also just
got a situation where you have an older
Zeon x58 build and the motherboard is
all blue and light blue and so you're
never gonna get all that to match up
very nicely I mean I give props to this
build because it's probably a very
functional system with some parts that
aren't necessarily parts that you would
expect and I don't know Oliver if you've
been sort of partying this system out
for a while or if you got some good
deals on stuff or whatever but I'm yeah
yeah it's it's definitely unique cool
you'd have to have good the entire
platform I think if you want to make
some huge aesthetic leaps
thank you that Oliver thanks man and
then finally we have rail Yoram rail
grim relig ran with an 8700 k h 100 I
beat to an asrock extreme for 16 gigs of
Ripjaws 5 GTX 970 and a Corsair c70 case
alright um okay what do we got here uh
cable management right off the bat my
eyes are drawn to your power supply
cables and just sort of how loose those
are I feel like that could be tidied up
a little bit maybe zip ties zip tie that
bunch together your HD audio cable looks
like it's stretching a little bit you
know things are a little bit
loosey-goosey and you know obviously
some sleeved extensions would help you
clean up the look of the build overall
for your ATX
24-pin your your GPU let's see what else
we got here it looks like you have lots
of airflow which is nice
to those fans that you've kind of
mounted to the left of your drive cages
I'm sure that's gonna add some more
airflow to keep EU the red Ram sticks
I'm not a huge fan of just because there
isn't much else in your system that's
red other than
one of the LEDs on your motherboard
because I feel like this isn't count too
much um I take the power supply sticker
off and there's a there's an interesting
like Fame controller thing done here in
the drive cage right I've Cajon right
I'm wondering if there's a point it's a
3.5 inch front panel but he's just stuck
it into one of the 3.5 inch drive I mean
that spare I don't have a problem with
it I mean if you needed that in order to
get all your fans working many fans are
in here you got an exhaust rear exhausts
might be a couple up here in the front
for intake yes maybe 7 I did it just
it's a Z 370 board I don't feel like it
would be that short on fan connectors or
anything I don't know that's like with
like he had it in an old build and so he
wanted to keep using it or so it could
be that some people just prefer Hardware
control for their fans which I guess
office and header here is honestly and
hit her here oh yeah cuz sometimes like
fan software can just be garbage or just
not work properly okay and can be
finicky so I understand like it's sort
of peace of mind if you if you turn that
knob half way you know it's gonna be 50%
fan speed and you can sort of easily
measure that out and it's like sometimes
fan fan software works perfectly fine
other times it could be finicky or give
you bad bad readouts and stuff like that
I've had some negative issues with it
but um you know it Paul could be right
maybe you're recycling this from an
older system I still have a couple fan
controllers from you know 2012 that what
do you think of the red okay that's why
I said minimal red accent that's why I
said I was like I'm not a huge fan of
the Red Sticks
because all it really matches with is
that one red LED on your motherboard
which doesn't really count in my opinion
that red LED taped up or something
so deliberate and
I think it would look cleaner overall if
they were just black dims to be on black
or silver because you do have some nice
silver on your your your i/o shield why
is it say Intel on that on that
motherboard there on his i/o shield
because it's an Intel motherboard really
he's got Intel Gigabit Ethernet this is
a it's a smart board I didn't realize
that board
I didn't realize 17 there was an azrog Z
370 board the hedge so such like potent
Intel branding on it I haven't seen that
very often it's because of the that's
specifically advertising the Gigabit
Ethernet controller I imagine that's is
it
that's an Intel Gigabit Ethernet
controller on here yes is it 10 I don't
know I'm not I feel like it'd have to be
tend to warrant that big of a may cause
I mean it's funds and other boards have
big effects and asrock is known to you
know throw a 10 gigabit NICs onto onto
their boards yeah but I'd have to
double-check the stats yeah but um you
know I mean there's a lot about this
bill that's good too
you know yeah I know I wonder I feel
like the radiator placement for your i/o
looks a little bit too far to the right
I feel like if you can move it towards
the back of the case like you wouldn't
extend the tubing so much and it would
just like a little bit more balanced
that's layered that's probably a weird
personal core combined though I disagree
with and I like it you like it
the radiator is centered as far as the
case goes there's a gap in the front
there's a gap in the back also the
tubing length is it's this it's fine I
think because you you see the center
there's a nice there's a nice curve to
it if you if you change it too much it
might get droopy you don't want it you
know droopy tubes I I'd rather have some
slack to my tubes than have them pulled
taut IMO it's like I don't even know you
anymore
I call you drippy who are you droopy
tubes day I'll call you droopy colors
your boo tubes day Kyle straight
stranger Pyramus I don't know
keep your bill the way it is don't
listen anything either of us are saying
but thank you nonetheless real grim for
that submission that's going to conclude
pin by PC I think you all for seven
those pics we'll be doing some more next
week or in the future also Brian from
bps customers wanted to send me a
picture of a rig that he's been working
on he likes to show them off on her show
which I was like totally down for but I
don't know where where that tweet is so
Brian hit me up next week and we'll get
you featured on the count's press all of
it gets so I say we just I'm super
hungry so let's let's get faceoff once
again I like that is the most skippable
segment ever and we could dive right in
to Q&amp;amp;A and Johnson starting with some
donations here
oh yes Brett lomez for the $5 how long
were you and wifey sauce actually stuck
on the ride
Brett is referencing our Disneyland vlog
that we uploaded today which you should
you guys should definitely check out I
spent a good eight hours editing that
really and it's a 10-hour video yes I
spent a long time editing that well I
mean you don't really realize it when
you watch it what's lots of footage and
trying to just make it non stop
entertaining by cutting like every
single piece of dead space takes a lot
of time and I threw in some like you
know random things here and there that
are funny but guys check that out he's
talking about us being stuck on one of
the rides that shut down that broke down
while we were on it it was the Big
Thunder Big Thunder Mountain Railroad we
were stuck on that ride for about at the
Pirates eat the people no they did not
there were no pirates on that one that
was prior to the Caribbean but you're
stuck on them right for about 20 minutes
before someone came and got us must have
been hell it wasn't too bad we were all
kind of like talking to the other people
on the on the ride and just shooting the
shit and having a lousy cannibalism did
you have to resort to there was no
cannibalism as I suspected initially
they did they did look hungry when they
when they showed up but fortunately it
was not for the human flesh you got
lucky
we did those cannibalism stories
Disneyland but thank you for your
concern Brent and your donation Robert
rule for the five bucks no comment
thanks forever no comment back to you
sir other than thank you you ruled
Joseph - sure five dollars would you be
in mr. Rogers Network neighborhood why
for our Strix graphics card shroud so
oversized with no purpose happy Tuesday
yes I would mr. Rogers Network
neighborhood no area very trustworthy
nope and strict sorry for Harry crowds
and they they look they liked a big
surface area size matters to a lot of
these manufacturers what I understand
it's about surface area surface area and
you
from the fins and stuff Biggers better
sometime
bazinga Xing yeah $25 here's your 25 for
breaking the ride at Disney I take full
credit for that stunt and you got paid
for that easily I'm gonna need a lot
more than $25 to fix all this shit I did
to them
Robert rule how he commented this time
Rob rule five dollars I already have an
RX 570 but it's in my i-5 760 Linfield
should I bite the bullet on ddr4 and
build something ah Linfield man Linfield
was just before Sandy Bridge and it's
probably getting to be pretty old at
this point I haven't looked at any
direct to numbers on it but definitely
if you can hold out for a bit longer
it's probably worth it to weights and a
couple months and see if memory prices
start to die down a little bit right
memory and GPU pricing are the two
things that are keeping building your
own PC and a realm of hurt hurtfulness
and hatred right now but we're told you
know ddr4 production bike ramp back up
demands might might taper off a bit
prices might normalize hopefully that
actually happens yeah we can only do
jubie's 13 dollars and 37 cents Coursera
ll series fans or fantex halos by the
way will you guys ever attempt a 24 hour
extra livestream both both jujubee's you
should definitely do both do both both
fans um it just really there's different
they're different things
they're two different things yeah you
commercial ll series fans are fans
fantex halos or fairness brackets that
go around the fans right fantex halos
are made to add on to fans that don't
necessarily already have lighting on
them I don't know of course their makes
ll serious fans that don't head of
lighting they don't they don't but let's
say for example you wanted the
performance of something like Corsairs
ml or Maglev series fans yeah but you
didn't like the fact that they didn't
have RGB or
any sort of aesthetic bling you could
put the fantex halos on those ml series
fans and have the best of both worlds
essentially the two don't really rival
but they complement each other yeah or
like like knock two n ff12 s or n FF for
teens like the industrial versions that
are all black yeah B plus the hills
would be a great combination of really
nice really nice well performing fan and
cool aesthetics the third part of that
which is the sucky part is how much it
would cost to get ya the halos and the
fans operating 24 hour extra livestream
I don't have currently plans 12 hours I
feel like is reasonable we're getting
old now I know we don't we don't do the
24 hour stream I would only do 24 hour
stream if it was a group thing if we had
like five or six people training yeah
like you didn't the fulbright didn't
always have to be on yeah you know all
the time or whatever which would be fun
we should consider that yeah maybe
possible MB sixty seven thirteen dollars
and 37 cents l wifey sauce is getting
hungry so here's a small donation to
help feed her and yourself
Cheers that is the one true way to my
wife's heart is through her belly so you
hit the nail on the head there thank you
very much MB should be both appreciated
Ethan L $5 you guys have inspired me to
create my own tech channel near the end
of this year looking forward to being
part of the family someday you're
already a part of the family that way if
you haven't it now part it built to your
system good luck on that though Ethan
hope it goes well pup Shepherd $20 hi
wags wags if you're kinky I do a weekly
show called pup talk new guests every
week we are on episode 202 203 well I
was out this Friday more episodes we
have of awesome heart midnight EST I
have I even have high-profile guests
such as Matt Baume pup struggle hexie
and more good to know
thank you very much pump Thank You pop
I'll be sure to check it out when I am
feeling extra kinky only if I'm feeling
I can keep hopefully though only how I'm
usually feeling yeah of course we should
host them tonight I have to watch that
yep Tyler Farnsworth $5 Kyle did you
ever get your GTA art hung up Paul is
the htpc still coming well this guy's
keeping us on our toes
Wow hippin at the heels cheers guys keep
up the great work PS boobs are awesome
and can't argue with their gta5 artwork
will be hung up as soon as I get the
little command poster strips I should be
here tomorrow or Thursday and they'll be
going those those the artwork will be
going right up behind all the video
cards and figurines and stuff there
it'll look really nice
HT PC is still coming I've had a really
hard time kind of getting back into the
swing of things and in this past month
but I've got some stuff planned for this
week so htpc yes is still among my
upcoming planned projects hopefully more
in that basin we should just do a bunch
of videos with boobs because boobs are
awesome that's probably the best the
best idea ever
probably more ROI on those Omar $10 gtx
1050 TI
or a used GTX 970 to get by for a few
months
right now I'd go for the used GTX 970
cuz even tempted DTI is overpriced or
like yeah like 200 bucks I don't know
how much used 970 s go for but that's
still still a solid card yeah bazinga X
$5 Kyle for April 1st April Fool's you
should break in and put all of Paul's
computers on the floor well I can't do
that now that you already said it with
him here I know roux is boiled darn it
you also have to set up a bunch of like
like cameras to record my reaction
everything's good I you just imagine you
walking in seeing the first computer oh
my god Oh what am I gonna do you know I
turn to the next one
oh my god another one oh my god it's
like 15 times 3 we have 2 mini computers
a floor we do house all do Chi once
again 13 dollars and 37 cents by the
Twitter of that guy with the messed up
room and the 1080i with one stick of RAM
and give him half of this money to buy a
broom oh that should be enough to fur
broom I would think you would think of
Elite broom unless unless but you know
sometimes you give someone like that the
broom and then the broom just like goes
on the floor and joins the
oh crap so as far as the problems having
I think to the chaos good suggestion
nonetheless thank you for the donation
guido trevor Claussen we have a
five-dollar information here what do you
think about frozen CP you saw them tweet
about for Pitt my PC I did not see them
to eat about to my PC did they but what
did they what did they tweet what did
they tweet I'm not sure Paul's gonna
look it up while we go to the next one
Danny Stanberry $5 I'm building a
nucleus for my fiancee should I wait for
rising too or just get rising 1.0 wait
for rising to the price hike is not
going to be substantial you'll probably
get a bit more for your money and there
will be a wide variety of options with
Rison just like we saw with the first
generation with rising to to really suit
your your needs and your budget okay
wait a minute my PC three arrows cool
they submitted frozen CPU if you're
watching this I would have totally
hosted you guys on the show and had I
caught it in time I think this is like
for me like I had already got all the
submissions I needed to before you
tweeted but cool hit me up next time
we'll be doing this probably again next
week of course they have all like these
nice water quick systems I like frozen
CPU so do I have ordered some stuff
there before oh yeah half of half of the
elite build was made with parts that I
bought from them but thank you very much
Daniel Danny and Trevor next we've got
Cody zero seven one two five dollars how
to place fans in a i/o cooler on front
of case assuming that your case has no
limitations on where those fans can go I
would say mounting them inside of the
case like not directly underneath the
actual front panel of the case but
inside of the frame itself would be the
best whether you're doing push or pull
try to get them as far away from the
front panel as possible to ensure that
you're getting ample airflow and intake
to that front area as far as push versus
pull that's an age-old debate some I
think I think the common consensus is
that pushes more effective but there's
also an equally strong argument for it
doesn't really matter all that much
you might be shaving off a degree or two
but as long as you're well under
t.j.maxx neither of that should matter
it kind of just boils down to your
personal preference and your you know
whatever limitations are dealing with so
try it out you know I mean it's an
ongoing thing a build is never done try
it and push first and and then after a
week or two after you've monitored the
temps try pull see if it makes a
difference but thank you very much for
the donation and the less strong storms
ooh I give up would a cheap 3770k be
worth it coming from a 2,500 K or should
I upgrade GPU got a z77 board and a GTX
970 thanks boys love from Scotland hmm I
would say if you've already got the if
you've already got the board then you
could do that I mean it'd still be fun
those it doesn't cross-compatible
I think bridge in San Dimas and a bridge
for cross compatible so
I would say it depends
it is raining or some would say right
now because you can compare these like a
3770k on its way to 500k because you can
pair them right now it's like rising
CPUs with 6 and 8 cores with
hyper-threading and the amount of
performance you get comparatively is a
lot more granted you might not be able
to get the same prices we're talking
about used parts so it's not exactly you
can't exactly say what's what with that
but I would say I'd say stick with your
2500 K overclocked rod Bloo Blee
adequate for you for now and it pairs
well with a GTX 970 and then save up for
a platform upgrade either something
current gen from Intel or AMD you know
yeah that would be my recommendation
okay Kevin Guzman Kevin $5 how hot is
too hot for hard drive and SSD new Mini
ITX PC makes my drives hit 65 degrees
while gaming once it hit 72 going back
to a mid tower PC soon Mini ITX was a
mistake that seems fine to me for drives
yeah nothing 570 no red flags there
that's on the warmer side they could
definitely be cooler but I think drives
need to get a lot warmer than that and
to actually start encountering issues
yeah whoa oh God talk about mechanical
drives very particular yeah one Oh ten
dollars thank you both for all your
videos I remember learning my sandy 2500
K and 580 GTX build which I still use
and I owe all the learning to you both
thank you you're welcome
now we're getting a much you owe us now
everybody stop donating there are no we
love your donations they're wonderful
but but there's so there's more rolling
in Cobra we're gonna cut this off after
after ahi Odie's ahi o DS is the last
donation I don't even see that one
visits in the chat Oh turbo sauce five
Canadians beginning beginner at peat
building a PC and building one next week
what's a good graphics card and CPU to
get on a $1,500
Canadian budget
building my first one next month 1500
that's like what 1100 us or something
like that maybe even it even less more
than that I think but okay
honestly it's really really hard to say
because good graphics card plus CPU
mainly is gonna be questioned what the
graphics card costs yeah how are you
paying more than MSRP how much more
what's available you're in Canada so
that check out some pre builds to be on
yes check out pre check out PLC's
compare that very very keenly against
the current GPU prices you know and and
maybe consider waiting if if you really
can't find a GPU that's a reasonable
price yeah I have a video coming out
pretty soon on NZXT T's BLD service
which is their pre built service okay
which is actually pretty interesting and
you can get cheap use for MSRP through
that nice that'll be coming very soon so
keV party right six dollars and sixty
six Canadian I love the show guys keep
up the good work wasn't there supposed
to be a mail section this week since
Kyle Headen check his fuel box a month
yeah thank you for bringing it up
my PA box because I been a slacker and I
haven't checked it in about two months
actually closed they closed my p o-- box
all the fan mail that was sent to there
in the last two months
got sent back no no so yeah
the good news is that i'm now aware of
the issue i've reopened the p o-- box i
got the same p o-- box actually oh good
they didn't give it to somebody else it
was still available that's still to
change it's still 1449 everything's the
same
so just everyone who got fan mail sent
back to them it's not because I just
didn't like you so just send it back to
me and I will open it on a future
episode of the show I do apologize and I
will be much more diligent in checking
my P o box I just didn't get the renewal
slip I thought because you know
everything else in my life is on
automatic renewal so I just don't have
to deal with anything all my
subscriptions licenses and stuff P o
boxes it's the post office they're still
old-school so they like slip a little
Renu
we'll notice into your PL box at the end
of each year for you to renew the pl box
and keep it so I just missed it in the
last CES with Christmas New Year's I
mean it's been a hell of the last two
months and I'm usually not that bad but
just happened to miss it this time
around so guys keep sending us stuff
we'll be checking it later my PA box is
still in good standing he is Paul's not
a fuckup like I am um i ddod $25 Paul I
remember watching your videos on Newegg
way back when I got started great to see
you making it on your own
Kyle the wife saw me watching your
Disney video now we have to go this year
you're on my list for a day huh
JK it's expensive it is was it's like
over a hundred bucks a day for one park
now yeah it was uh
is about a hundred bucks for for me and
wife is sauce each that's crazy just to

pretty much the show before we sign off
we're gonna do a twitch raid this is one
of my favorite things I do on this show
is raid the shit out of someone who has
way fewer viewers than we do so that
when you finally do raid them they
usually give this crazy reaction like oh

entertaining so today I don't know it's
not a guarantee sometimes they're just
like sweet if they don't react like as
at least as intensely as they were not
worth our rate and they should go to

self-confidence absolutely and anyone
