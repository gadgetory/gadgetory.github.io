figure that but it's fine no idea fine
it's the weirdest thing ever all it'll
all work itself out
sure welcome are we each streaming to
both probably all right it's good enough
for me probably is all I need are as I
can tell
welcome to side B of Awesome Hardware
episode 175 the live show that Paul and
I do every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
just epic time right here on twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware we also stream
the show to our respective YouTube
channels site a was on Paul's channel
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware you
can check out the link in my description
this after the fact and then now we're
streaming to my my channel so it's all
fun and dandy we split it 50/50 because
we believe in fairness like streaming
communism Richard goddamn socialist
goddamn exactly and we also have our
stores if you like what we do on YouTube
you can also support us by buying
something from either of our stores my
store is bibliothèque where I've got a
variety of really nice merchandise that
is a quality mate quality made to auto
and yeah there's a lot of good options
here the fidgets spinners are still in
stock somehow handcrafted hand attitudes
it poor section of everyone act your
fidget spinner stock
I have not look at that action shot look
at it oh yeah it'll look like that in
real life I just feel like the fidget
spinner thing it's gonna reduce kind of
a resurgence in 2019 everyone buy stock
everyone go buy stock and fidgets
spinners right now it's on the up and up
if you don't want to fidget spinning ER
but you want something with a pulse
Hardware thumb screw logo on it which is
timeless and always classy
check out Paul Simon Milo goes timeless
and always classy as well that me saying
my logo has those attribute attribute
does necessarily mean there's does not I
was just trying to sell my shit all
right mm-hmm
thumbscrews shirts we got olive green
now available as well as some hoodies
and some pint glasses and beanies the

made with the organs of real cotton
plants I'm not sure that's what organic
means but
follow us that later will give you a
Johnson at the end of the episode if you
happen to buy anything from either of
our stores and thank you to our good
friend and moderator cell processing in
chat for keeping things together look
like you guys are on pretty good
behavior today is your video unlisted
Kyle check my video that says your
videos unlisted oh is it unlisted well
see Jen about now I read chat yeah you
know I don't expect anyone to watch my
my house it's a pity party now yeah
everyone feels sorry for me
no it should be public now thank you
very much chat for looking out paramedic
thank you for purchasing the thumbscrew
mousepad and I really hope you enjoy it
who knew a thousand people catch more
things than I do all right we should be
we should be public now fully fix all
right let's talk about tech news we've
got a couple stories here starting from
hot hardware they've done an article on
DJI a lot of people are talking about
this DJI was rocked by a massive fraud
scandal recently which could lead to
some really big losses so the world's
largest producer of consumer drones just
realized that there are several cases of
fraud within their own company they
could lose more than 150 million bucks
due to corruption this is a pretty big
deal within the company a very
well-known popular and respected company
very I mean they're just all over the
place so they had a big they usually
have a big showing at CES always have
some good stuff to show off so much
corruption is going on right now within
the company DJI is currently
investigating themselves and and they
have they've already contacted law
enforcement so they've called the cops
on themselves they called the cops on
this way you gotta get down here I'm
really fucking up I need some self help
you know great feed from the drone
recording the other drones which are all
engaging in drone drone sodomy right is
that does that involved uh actually yeah
I think so because it does say that that
the company created a high-level
anti-corruption task
Oh to investigate the corruption further
which I would imagine is just a fleet of
drones that you know you know how that
like you know how like DJI has has their
their Matic pro they've got their
phantom Pro they also have the inspire
one I think now they have the Enquirer
one probably that they're just like the
drones going around just asking people
like are you correct the DJI inquire
it's the exactly the same as the inspire
except it asks you interrogate of
questions like are you guilty that
they've kicked off like the drone ish
Inquisition that's what you're saying
exactly the diffuser somebody expects
the drone Inquisition that's exactly
what's happening here I think it's a
very effective method that's where I'm
going with this
they're they're drones made for fun and
to intimidate but at the same time so
and see this is all probably brought to
light by my by my killer robots of CES
video exactly which obviously was
squashed by the YouTube algorithm
because I had the word killer in the
title but I didn't really not do as well
as you'd hope no I did very poorly
really I mean compared to the rest of my
CES coverage
I wanted it sure you're probably right
killer sure it's because it's a killer
in the title on YouTube you know that's
a bad that's bad it's it's a bad I don't
know though because I've been watching a
lot of the or a serial killer like
serial killer Chronicles that have just
millions of views from like the Chris
Watts case and shit like that on YouTube
on YouTube and this is the word killer
in the title all the like big massive
killer so I don't know maybe you're
saying it's the killer robots themselves
it's probably the killer robots to
squash my video because they don't want
to shed light on how close they are to
destroy I am happy at least that that
hot hardware is is backing me up by
publishing this story now on DJ eyes
drones which we're not saying they're
gonna be killer drone are killer drones
but I think it could be done he's saying
in the future we're just saying that the
world's biggest producer of of drones
and a massive 50 were gentle obviously
where I wouldn't put you in the best
situation if you were
to prevents killer drones because I feel
like if you wanted to cover up fraud the
best way to do that would be killer
dramas that's how I'm wrapping this all
up that's its that's all I'm saying I
have a feeling to see you of DGI
is a drone like heat like the drone just
created this whole company from the
ground up and he's trying to blow the
lid off of himself to make the humans
look bad so that the drones have more
power and can eventually take over does
the CEO drone actually know that he is a
drone himself or does he believe is just
a human as one of those stories like the
people go to the office there's this big
like massive drone hovering they're like
what is your report and like sir
everything I feel like it's situation
I'm getting out of control but I think
it's like like ah get me a drink of
water I don't think we should do that
sir like I need water I'm thirsty and
that that see well like it's the other
sap I feel like it's equally terrifying
either way like okay there's this guy
Hitler he's killed millions and millions
of people yeah but is he self-aware does
it change the fact that he's threatening
force I'm saying and I know you fear
your beard in the Hitler territory
that's just like I Hitler the ultimate
trump card yeah oh they're a play on
words somewhere in there all right we're
getting off topic what's best of luck DJ
I love your products thanks let's see
there's a YouTube video that I found on
the the hardware subreddit thought I
thought I thought was interesting from
the partings I think it's pronounced
ratings but I have no idea our things
are things they tested 25 freesync
monitors with GeForce GPU to see if the
updated driver from Nvidia actually does
allow you to run free sting support or
half racing support with a Pascal or
newer GeForce GPU and this guy is very
short video because they've linked the
full article the written article and
stuff you if you want to check that out
it's in the video description
Daniel this is Daniel which who I am not
familiar with you do you know Daniel do
you know him
no okay how do you know his name is
Daniel he just because I've jumped to
the part in the video where they put his
name oh okay so you just watched the
first five seconds the video which I
clearly failed to do so so basically
they it's it's pretty straightforward
here bottom line is that most panels
most racing panels function the same
regardless if you're using a geforce
card or an AMD GPU it doesn't really
matter there are some exceptions however
for example you can run free sync over
HDMI yeah and there are some free sync
displays and TVs especially that only
have HDMI ports but support free sync
you cannot take advantage of free sync
adaptive refresh rate with a geforce
card using those panels because it's
only available via display board that's
how the Nvidia engineers our coders
optimized it or added support was
through the DisplayPort as article
acquirements cuz exactly she sync has
never been HDMI compatible yeah do you
think is always required DisplayPort
correct so that's an exception and they
did have they did encounter some
glitching and stuttering and things like
that with a couple of the panels maybe
like two of them I think is is are the
ones that they listed the Samsung UJ 590
that they found constant tearing and
artifacts with the gtx 1060 as well as
the samsung youíve 590 they found
similar artifacts with the geforce card
when it was when they won those panels
were working perfectly fine with AMD
equivalence so this also ties into the
geforce compatible standard that nvidia
is created for for for this added
support which it's it's still kind of
unclear as to what ticks all the boxes
and what's required by nvidia
specifically to become a decent
compatible display but and they've only
verified about 12 of 12 of the freesync
monitors I think in out of hundreds and
hundreds 400 plus 400 plus to be fully
you know g-sync compatible
nvidia has their high standards about
them but it seems to be the fact that
most free sync panels will work
perfectly fine regardless of the type of
GPU you're using and that's pretty much
it I did want to also highlight that did
our friend Daniel says he pronounces the
word Nvidia very very interestingly if
you look at if you I don't know if
there's audio history of it
they didn't misspell it but he says it
in such a way that sounds like the top
comment is Nvidia Nvidia he says in a
video which I've never heard it
pronounced that way and I'm unsure if
it's like and he seems like he has a
British accent so I don't think it's
like a an accent thing where he cannot
physically pronounce the ends like in
Nvidia like Swedish people can't
pronounce why is they say or J's they
say yeah but uh it's just very
distracting it's very distracting in the
video he says the Nvidia Nvidia g-sync
supported cards eaten a video desync no
I'm gonna call it guessing Nvidia go
sync just just sync when paired with an
Intel CPU with the get expects 20/80 ty
we could probably find other examples of
that and but a seuss motherboard okay
I'm getting I'm getting off tangent here
let's move on to our next article which
is from hexxus about Corsair announcing
their new range of premium PC
accessories premium cables looks like
they're being in a call from spam you
could answer it on stream yeah
your hemorrhoid appointment is two weeks
away Paul it's really I don't have
hemorrhoids you can't no I know I mean I
wouldn't know either way I shouldn't say
I know I don't know the inner workings
of your butthole but what are you asking
about just you just letting the vibrate
you don't just like silence it so that
it doesn't vibrate any more that would
give the caller some indication that
there is actually someone on the other
line that they're calling from that they
might call back I disagree I think if
they knew that you purposely axed axed
their call that they'd be like this
person clearly isn't interested whereas
if you didn't then interfere they'd be
like oh they dish they weren't around
they were out of town they were at
Italia to call it might I'll call the
back what tomorrow my personal stance is
if that there is absolutely zero
indication that there is a human at the
other end of the number that's being
called that there will be less
likelihood that they attempt that call
again but that's just me love to
benchmark that at some point I mean what
would be nice is if the FCC was
continuing to go after Robo colors that
you know do you have Mr number or a
similar app installed no it's very handy
it'd be kind of annoying sometimes with
unprompted pop-ups but it'll tell you
it's like it's like ways but it's like a
crowdsourced
phone caller ID so you'll get a call and
like people just you know based on what
other people have said about that number
like this is a spam fake bank account
where this is a spam telemarketer from
India I would be worried about that
service being compromised and then my
name being somehow added to lists like
this person really doesn't want any
phone calls they should be added to like
the bug them more often list because
that's probably what they have because
it has a list of people like these
people super in our long gang calls so
like bug the shit out of them that's
that's my opinion
probably it's probably what's going on
there yeah I agree all right so Corsair
has got a new line of premium cables you
can see is lovely lovely cable cable
offered in both full-length and
extension models they they also do
feature inline capacitors for the 24 pin
ATX EPS 12 volt and PCI Express cables
for clean voltage delivery and
consistent stable power they look to be
paracord sleeves IMO if you look at the
close-up shot up top they look kind of
paracord II and they're kind of more
that fabric material because they're
sort of wavy you can kind of see have a
sort of wavy they look a bit more fabric
II tell you I wouldn't I wouldn't assume
that but I don't never sure
well maybe not paracord but at least
that sort of like more cloth fabric
material I would think that like a
picture that they're distributing for
people to show like hey look at these
fancy sleep they do everyone that they
would like they they obviously have
cable comb going up to this point but
everything beyond that is like oh this
is just go just go whichever way we want
and I have no idea if this is a promo
shot some Corsair this is Jeff I'm not
impressed
no no definitely not which is also kind
of why it was reverse air that's
directly from Corsair I know because I
picture I got the email that they sent
out oh no it's all your stuff that's
part of the fun thing I've sort of come
to realize that I use the same picture
as I am on some of these mailing lists
sure as I wake up in the morning and
I'll see an email that's gone out from
Corsair it's like hey of course there
has these products this product and this
product and this product and this
product and then I'll wait right and
like an hour later all of the tech like
written tech sites would be like Corsair
stuff and they basically have taken and
paraphrase the Corsair press releases
they put up but just how it works I mean
that's right work I just I just find it
interesting cuz of like oh I got that
email already right so I know what
they're talking about right no that's
true
now you have a valid point there Paul I
cannot argue with that you can't can
argue with your irrefutable can are you
with logic it's in there in arguable so
I I hope that you know I'd like to see
companies like Coursera because the
thing is like Corsair like if you're
gonna release custom cables I don't know
how well you can compete with
a company like cable mod which isn't
brand specific because your full-length
cables are gonna be I would I would
think wired directly to your PS use
whereas cable mod offers a variety the
extensions yes the extensions I could
say are universal that's safe to say
but I also feel like if you're thinking
extensions your first the first place
your minds gonna go is like a non brand
specific brand like cable mod not I'm
looking for extensions let's go to
Silverstone you know I will say that the
cable kits that I've gotten that kind of
like EVGA has you know cable extension
kits that you can get to come with that
that work with their power supplies I
just worked with the Asus Thor 1200 watt
power supply I kind of sleep cables
pulling cables as well as cable mod
combs that you can bring used to comb to
comb it up if you want to train them all
the right way sure none of those kits
that have come directly from the
manufacturer have had the same premium
feel and I would say thickness and yeah
it comes down to thickness thick of the
sleeving
right because those are they're just
like they're wrapped they're sleeved but
it's thinner then and like it doesn't
seem to fill out the cable comb right
maybe spaced apart and there's these
couple millimeters between these cable
like you can't wire but compare that to
like like you've got a kid over there
from in source that you just sprayed
from pollen to your hot line to write
all those kits that I've gotten like
they just they're just I don't know just
types of material yeah it's nicer that
whether it's paracord or otherwise rings
it just fills it out more yeah it really
is just that a little bit of thickness
that I feel like really had so much once
to that premium feel so definitely yes
yeah thick thickness it's very important
but for that reason I would say if
you're looking at like spending that
extra 50 to 150 bucks on custom sleeve
cables might as well really concern
about the aesthetics like go was one
with one of the smaller companies that
have been the dozen by hand resin to
order because so worth it it's really
worth it absolutely I agree
apart from that
you know they've got a bunch of
different things they have their own
branded thermal paste now which is which
is TM 30 the TM 30 which is supposed to
be you know high low velocity and or
viscosity sorry and yeah I mean I don't
know if we're gonna have to actually see
how it how it does compared to other
other options out there but Corsair
thermal paste is now a thing people are
obsessing that it's not 30 why is it
tiem 30 um I think that's just the model
name are they talking about the oh sure
30 indicates here for the TM 30 keeps
you it oh maybe it's the temperature
that they're promising who knows could
be I feel like the decimal point is in
the wrong place here point 0 to 9
degrees Celsius that is that accurate
well below freezing accurate to me yeah
that might be a typo I don't think that
if it is accurate they're basically
saying our thermal paste will give you
performance that is point zero zero six
degrees Celsius that's like that's
insane that's what it doesn't make sense
at all
point zero six degrees Celsius there's
no way in freezing hell I feel like
that's negligible like no it has to be
wait did you feel that what I just got
point zero zero 16 must be this it's
from an evil spirit oh yeah that's
probably a typo no I have to imagine I
mean but what if it's not what if
they're actually sticking to that like
nope this is this is maybe that's for
engineers for legal purposes you know
they can't claim anything more than that
so it could yeah you might be right
actually doing I'm just buying a game a
game yeah it's not so important it's not
important all right so so Corsair also
has nothing that's all they have I just
feel like they can't you know they're
like a lot of others it was kind of it
was kind of a mix of things a lot of
them right oh you got thermal face now
you've got a few other things now there
was nothing that jumped out to me they
they have a key they have a PCI Express
extension cable now Anchorage is like
did you can buy that anywhere fine
there's a lot of companies that have
those there's nothing unique there's
nothing it looks like a clean design for
I like the individual bands for the 5
for the for the PCIe leads going through
there
what's a clean looking cable and premium
it is important to get a premium PCI
Express extension these these like
sleeve to SATA cables like wow that's
only available in red white and blue
though and black which I find kind of
bizarre I mean you got a problem with
the red red blue cow no but I just feel
like why not like green or yellow or
orange there's so many other colors that
people use that's true these must be the
most common colors people use those are
the same colors that they offered in
their their AF and SF series fans when
they first came out we really have the
Rings the detachable rings on their fans
oh wait people are hold on I also make
no plans colors temperature rise per
watt
all right to clarify what we were making
fun of earlier and that chat has now
pointed out well this is the temperature
rise per watt so that actually is
accurate temperature Oh temperature rise
her water what that okay
so why didn't I don't catch that sorry
chat did not it was fun to make fun of
briefly though until you guys pointed
out that it actually was listed yeah way
to use logic and shit now we've stupid
now we've no we have nothing to laugh at
anymore way to ruin our fun and it's
your fault it is all right so I'll let's
move on to the next story which is about
gigabytes this is an article from
overclocked 3d dotnet covering their
Oris r-tx 2070 gaming box this is a GPU
enclosure desktop GPU enclosure that
comes included with an RT X 2070 that's
branded by auras of course uses
Thunderbolt 3 connectivity to your
Ultrabook or ultra-thin laptop to add
the gaming horsepower of of a full-size
desktops
so they see this looks like it's not
like there's a separate discrete
graphics is there a separate discrete
graphics card in there yes could you
pull it out of there
yes well I don't know if you could pull
it out so she said but there is a
desktop GPU in there RTX 2070 that has a
custom heatsink and custom fan in there
that wouldn't be ideal for a desktop
situation this looks like a large fan
yeah mm-hmm it's got its own unique
cooling system but it is a desktop RTX
27 t in there all right which sure why
not I'd be curious to see more pictures
of this we do everything because yeah I
mean I guess you could assume that if
somebody is buying something like this
pardon me to use with a laptop right
they don't care about having the
flexibility of like a separate discrete
graphics card in there that I could pull
out no and drop into a gaming desktop PC
or something like that
yeah all you care about is the
effectiveness and the functionality of
this little unit itself so they're
building an entire external unit
specifically designed with with the idea
in mind that it is gonna be an external
unit so they're putting a big old fan in
there that's that's somewhat interesting
I mean it's kind of cool that they've
gone the extra mile to optimize the
cooling for this particular structure
and environment and form factor and
stuff they didn't just stick a GPU in
there so for which leads me to believe
that it's gonna be cooler and quieter
then if you were to just have stuck one
of gigabytes
RTX 2070 models in there well if you're
able to like most graphics cards are
made to fit within a footprint that's
you know the height of a PCI Express
expansion slot by you know 10 to 12
inches right maybe a little bit higher
than that if it's a custom PCB or
something like that but right you know
they keep it within those specifications
to have the maximum amount of inter
compatibility true with lots of
different installations if you a home
builder you can drop it in there you can
sell that to an OEM who says we're gonna
make you know several thousand of this
this system at the specs with this power
draw right and we want this graphics
card to drop in there so taking that
away you don't have to build
specifically to fit those that wide
variety of scenarios sure probably have
a lot more flexibility with the cooling
solution and one of the best things to
do when it comes to fans is just make
the fan bigger sure looks that that
looks like a much larger that looks like
180 millimeter fan to me maybe right
give or take yeah it's hard to say how
big that cold enclosure is but it does
look like a pretty big much larger than
a conventional fan a decent amount of
space here with some exhaust at the back
so yeah that's that's an interesting
product that differentiates it a little
bit more from those like hey we built
this external we have this external box
connects via lightning in just any
hydro-zone GPU graphics card drops in
there which there is some appeal to that
and I think it still remains to be seen
as to whether you could swap out this
r-tx 2070 for a different GPU down the
line it seems like you might not be able
to because it's got this custom cooler
on it so there's a bit of a drawback
there this eye or I should say a trade
off you get maybe a more robust cooling
solution but a proprietary GPU the
flipside might be now you're stuck with
the graphics card that's in there and if
you ever want a deaf grade to a 20 atti
while you're screwed because you have a
custom
proprietary cooling so it's an
all-in-one solution you got to buy a
whole new that's device that's the flip
side to that yeah so let's move on to
our next article here which is from
hexxus Dutton and once again AMD has
responded to the Radeon seven short
supply rumors because as we mentioned in
in last week's episode there were a lot
of there's a lot of speculation that
there'd only be 5,000 units made of the
Radeon seven which is not a lot and that
there would be no adding board partner
variants available so
AMD responded pretty quickly and they
said while we don't report on production
numbers externally we will have products
available via via Adam board partners
and AMD comm at launch of February 7th
thanks for reiterating when these will
be available we already knew that
and we expect Radeon seven supply to
meet demand from gamers which is a
fairly weak and underwhelming response I
would say because it doesn't you don't
necessarily you could still consider
like they might be saying like yeah
we're gonna have added board partner
variants but they might be meaning like
like the rebranded reference designs or
it's exactly the same cooler but it just
has an EVGA logo on it or something
similar it doesn't mean anything and
they also didn't confirm or deny if
there were only going to be 5,000
samples made or 5,000 units made or a
very limited quantity the fact that they
say you know there's going to be enough
to meet demand could literally mean
anything that's so subjective
what if they expect demand to be 5,000
units exactly exactly what if they're
just not expecting you know there to be
a bunch of demand based on whatever
performance and pricing that they're
offering it's it's basically saying
something without saying anything
they're just saying to say it and it
still remains to be seen this doesn't
clarify anything so it's really a this
is a news news or article saying that
there is no news apart from AMD being
just slightly dodgy about the situation
Nvidia CEO
however Jenson Huang claimed that his
competitors new card of the Radeon 7
and I quote lousy performance while he
confidently says will crush it some
fighting words there from from from the
leather jacket wearing man himself
lousy performance and will crush it
which to me means okay does he already
have a sample of the Radeon seven does
he know what it's capable of like how
would he know does he have like inside
insider spies that steal Radeon sevens
or competing products give them to hater
Jensen this is what we found from all
competitive look at it then he can
verify then this is clearly I think I'm
it's safe to say you know publicly that
this is lousy right
as I already know the performance how
does he know how does he know what the
Radeon seven state Belov it's
interesting any time I see something
like this from a competitor talking shit
talking smack on one of the rivals like
do how how subjective or objective is
that and and how how good how well
performing does the Radeon seven need to
be to even stay competitive with Nvidia
at a $6.99 price point $6.99 is I mean
you could I looked at Newegg earlier
today and I found two maybe one or two
r-tx 2080s for about 700 bucks
maybe for 720 safe to say within the
seven hundred dollar price range if
you're looking about if you're talking
about gaming or you're interested in
gaming first and foremost the Radeon
seven has to compete with an RT X 2080
yeah to be competitive in my opinion has
to at least like chase it close enough
to where you could overclock it and get
really close or right on par with that
performance otherwise people are just
gonna buy the RT x 2080 we don't know I
don't know I don't know has anyone ever
tested a instinct was it M 150 mi 150 in
gaming it's not it doesn't it's not a
fair comparison scale one to ones and
the drivers like right like my optimized
for gaming completely different and yeah
gaming drivers are optimized for games
so that's a pretty significant impact
how many streaming processors does the
Radeon stuff of that much I never get
it's an it's in the video I don't
remember off the top of my head I don't
listen
at any rate like everything that AMD has
come out with when it comes to the
Radeon seven that they have been
comparing to moderate you know two
recent Nvidia stuff has been comparing
it to the 20 80s right bring some to my
from my perspective that means
AMD has a graphics card mm-hmm they're
able to produce in a reasonable volume
whether that means five thousand cards
or whether it means more than that
remains to be seen
they find that it has reasonably
competitive commence against a twenty
eighty and they're able to sell it for a
price that is in the same range as a
twenty eighty and they're definitely
pushing not just gaming performance but
also like content creation stuff with it
and I think that has to do with the the
16 gigs of HBM to memory which is a lot
of memory for a gaming graphics card so
it could be a very nice product there
they're pushing sort of a crossover use
case scenario sure but I think that is
also a use case scenario that you know
there's a reasonable amount of people
who might be interested in right now
because there might be reasonable number
of people interested in a graphics card
that can do pretty good at games and can
also like you know we run the shit out
of some some video processing or
something like that or 3d rendering or
anything in that rep problem so that's
so niche
point being you know we'll have to wait
and see when when it comes to the card
itself right anything Jensen has to say
about this right now I would have to say
is pretty heavily slanted based on the
fact that he's a CEO of the number-one
competitor it's AMD right so trying to
make a just know your wine from the he's
just trying to throw something out there
to throw some shade to the throws and
also feeling very confident because you
know NVIDIA has been doing very well and
they've been pretty unmatched in the
high-end market so far yes
don't you see we'll see you very soon
just adding the how that because the
launch date is February 7th yes so stay
tuned stay tuned stay tuned stay tuned
next segments though necks hauled hit my
porn no have my definitely not it not
take of the day ask the audience ass
we're asking you guys some questions I
came up with these questions five
minutes before the show started so the
all really bad but I don't care you
don't have a see audience in here Cal I
don't have asked the audience yeah
whatever happened time to ask the
audience really yeah have we never done
that segment on maybe never over at my
house weird oh it's all right just just
throw up a random one that we haven't
done in years cool story bro story bro
sure yeah so this is where we ask you
guys a series of three questions you
answer as honestly as possible that's
what makes it fun and then Paul and I
try to speculate and argue over what
your answers are going to be q and egg
oh my god Wow whoo Wow
Rafi Wow last one last that's something
to stall juh it's a straight double shot
and nostalgia without a chaser right
there so we're gonna ask you guys some
questions we're gonna post some polls
and chat you guys answer honestly and
then Paul and Paul will speculate over
what your answers are and whoever is
farthest away from determining what the
actual audience response is we'll have
to take a swig of their drink so the
first question I have here is I think
it's a pretty it's it seemed like a
stupid question at first but then I
realize like this is actually a pretty
good question that probably doesn't get
asked enough what's the perfect size the
perfect size for an SSD boot drive so
you got an SSD that you're putting your
operating system onto what's what's like
the good size like what's the sweet spot
happy medium perfect size that's not
gonna cost you too much but also gonna
give you enough room enough ceiling room
for all your applications all your
frequently used apps and software's you
know based on 20 19's pricing and trends
and things like that I think this is a
pretty good question after all so we're
good Paul and I are gonna speculate on
that I feel like that has that link that
looks like that links already gone out
in chat thank you very much talent at
all do we want to talk about this first
or should we ask the second question
next what you think I do think we should
ask the second question all right we'll
ask the second question next this is
totally off on a tangent completely
unrelated to
to the PC space but I just popped in my
mind because I was kind of curious to
hear you guys as thoughts here would you
actually legitimately volunteer to be on
mankind's first journey to Mars would
you actually step volunteer to step on
foot step on board that spaceship that
rocket and go to Mars and be the one of
the first humans to ever attempt landing
on Mars keyword attempt no guarantee
that you're gonna get there you're just
you're just volunteering your guinea pig
in here I don't know I think it's kind
of a provocative question there's
there's some things to be gained very
provocative some things to be lost so
let's go back to our first question here
what's the perfect size for an SSD boot
drive Paul your thoughts I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say one terabyte because I
love one terabyte SSD that's you're
following your heart yeah and I can't I
can't knock you for following your heart
what I feel you're gonna have a hard
time convincing me otherwise you know
yeah one terabyte SSDs are just they're
just they're awesome they are sexy
because you install windows and you know
and then you download like a game like
like call of duty black ops 4 which is
80 freaking gigs or whatever yeah I mean
I I don't care and I have a 1 terabyte
SSD yeah there's just so much room sure
I don't even have to think about it true
um until I start copying a bunch of
video files to the desktop yeah yeah in
which case you know it starts to fill up
and then you're like oh crap I need to
copy those files to an eternal Drive and
once you do that you can delete them you
have any free up some space and then you
get into sort of a back and forth where
that's sort of a never-ending thing
because you've had so many so many video
files to copy there's just so much every
time you make videos
like 80 gigs worth footage 120 gigs
worth of footage never stops where do
you put all the video fuck gotta put
them on the desktop gotta put it
somewhere you know that's dusty you
gotta gotta copy them
make sure the copied into locations
because one of the SSDs dies would it
what happens then
well like you lose like your video
footage B if what you've done I feel
like you feel like you're definitely
pitching this from a content creators
perspective which may not be
representative of the average user just
how I feel okay but but also very very
passionate very passionate response
thank you I'm gonna say I'm gonna say
500 gigs I'm gonna say 500 gigs as a
sweet spot 500 get like the price on
SSDs in general has come lay down where
you can buy a 500 gig SSD for the price
you you were able to buy a 250 gig or
even a 120 gig SSD way in the past and I
think 500 gigs is great because you know
you maybe you get 10 to 30 gigs for your
OS and you've got your frequently used
applications and programs maybe you know
another 10 20 30 gigs there and you've
got you've still got some room maybe
your frequently used games that you can
you could install them there but it's
also gonna be significantly cheaper than
a full one terabyte drive I think you
know mechanical storage still very much
has its place and I agree with Paul you
should get a one terabyte OS drive if
it's your only drive or for some reason
you have a very small a smaller size
companion Drive to accompany it but I
think as an OS drive 500 gigs is the
current sweet spot if you're talking
about the mid to high end build if
you're if you're still on the more
conservative budget level I think 250
gig is pretty solid but I think if
you've got the just a little bit of
extra cash flow there 500 gig gives you
that extra ceiling room and that peace
of mind because there is also
performance degradation over time as you
fill up your drive and I feel like 250
gig drives can get filled up pretty
quickly and that's the last drive you
want to get performance degradation on
is the
that you're booting your operating
system from so 500 gig is my thoughts
should we look at the results now or yes
go to now before people you know change
change all their minds to 50 Wow to
fitty we were both wrong to fitty but I
was closer here both wrong it's closer
by a lot though we're both wrong we both
lose but I was wrong you were wrong her
doesn't it doesn't matter Kyle does
that's how it's how it works
whoever's the wrongest I mean it has to
drink if the penalty for losing was
death would that mean that I would be
more dead than you yes no it wouldn't
mean you were more the dead you'd just
be dead and I would keep my life they'd
both be dead no because in it we both
lose but in this case whoever is the
most right wins the dude the dude who
picked 250 gigs would win no he'd be
alive no whoever is the least wrong its
whoever is the least wrong wins
that's how you win is you be the least
wrong so you would be dead this wasn't
me and I would be fortnight dancing over
your over your rotting corpse this
wasn't made clear to me before we
embarked upon this you shouldn't have a
contract for meliorate that both of us
lost
therefore we both are dead and one of us
lost by him much I went with the Irish
Mike a good answer just because not
enough people recognize the good answer
do you know Mike circumstances no what
you know no one likes the underdog in
that that should be held against me
what's the third question we're gonna
answer question is all right I really
like this question it doesn't make any
sense which which PC part like out of
all the parts in a PC which which part
would die first in a battle royale match
cuz battle Royales all the rage these
days we've got the sort of like eight or
nine you know commonly used components
in a build CPU motherboard memory video
card CPU cooler power supply hard drive
SSD case which one would die first if
they if they had an all-out brawl I see
which of these parts would die first but
so we'll get that out in chat you guys
can go ahead and vote on that
let's go back to our our first or second
question here would you volunteer to be
on mankind's first journey to Mars and I
think I think we should do a percentage
here you should say yes or no and then
the percentage you feel is going to be
accurate so I'll go first this time
okay I I feel like most people would say
no but not by a lot especially with our
tech savvy audience I'm gonna say no and
I'm gonna say 42% 42% no 42% say hell no
all right I'm gonna go with what I
originally thought I was gonna say
before I heard your answer okay which
was which was 37% not 37% 37% no all
right that's because if you're asked to
pick a number between one and a hundred
you pick there's a very high percentage
chance that you'll pick the number 37
that's just statistically accurate all
right click vote before they skew their
reviews if you want to like trick your
friends and family and some thinking
that you're psychic or something go to
them do like pick a number between one
and a hundred and then think 37 and
there's like a pretty good chance that
that's what they picked I will try that
next time try it out and blame you try
it out results results
34% Oh which means I win I'm much closer
I sent 37% for hell yes you said 40 yeah
for hell yes right yes okay you said 40
something I did this is 43 Thank You
last number I was only off by obviously
isn't borne out but as Mystics 8% not
bad not bad
still you lost still lost it's really a
third really third of you okay and go
into the going to Mars
all right do you take your squig of
course it it
that's right thought
I have to pee now
Oh welcome to my world alright last
question which PC part would die the
first die first
in a battle royale match okay I'm gonna
say hard drive I thought you might I say
hard drive because it is of all of the
parts on this list the one that is of
the most outdated and also the one that
you could get by without if you had no
hard drive hate it you could you could
get by with everything else and on this
list like you have to have a CPU you
have to have a motherboard you have to
have memory you're going for making a
very pragmatic example you could get by
without a video card yes but I don't
feel like that is the first to die in a
battle royale match sure that you know
CPU cooler yeah maybe as well but I just
feel like her drive is gonna be the and
also if you hit if you punch a hard
drive while he's running you know he's
bound to get screwed up there exactly
thank you for proving my point Catherine
well no I mean stupid still stupid I I
would say I would say the motherboard
because the motherboard gets attacked on
all fronts it literally has every other
component in the system going for it
it's literally getting just like railed
it's like a it's like a royal gangbang
really the motherboard has to endure
it's not very it's not how you picture
your mother at all it's uh you know
every as our good friend ins and
moderator style always says every every
hole is a goal and that's it's not
necessarily the first thing you want to
hear when you're trying to protect those
holes and not get royally screwed and
all your mother ports
I I rest my case
that's all that's my strongest argument
at the moment I think I did I think I
did okay all right yeah that's
reasonable
so do we look at do we look at third
third results yeah let's look at the
third one results are drying oh you win
33% you win again anything close oh not
even close more than double damn the
number of votes is the next follow up a
secret CPU motherboard coming in third
so you weren't like that far off I guess
no not not too bad that horrible okay
all right here we go all right I win I
went again all right I drink this with
pride well done Cal and that that's it
is all four cows half of the show my
house thank you guys for watching
Kyle's half of the show ah we're still
gonna continue on some hardware with the
after party yeah which is linked in the
description yes no it is not in the
description it's public it's frickin
public you can do it find Italy in
public its public and you can find it on
the damn live streams first all right
and I'll put it in the damn description
right now cool
thanks for watching guys thanks thanks
for the time stamp maker as well please
do time stamp time stamps in the comment
section also donations and Johnson's
will be shattered out in the after party
yes so stay tuned for always very soon
all right bye guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
