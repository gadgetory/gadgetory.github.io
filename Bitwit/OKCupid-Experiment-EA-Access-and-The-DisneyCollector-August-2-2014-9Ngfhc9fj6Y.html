admitted to conducting experiments on
its users and social experiments the
service like many other dating sites
displays a match rating which calculates
the compatibility between users based on
their profiles and while the rating is
fairly accurate OkCupid co-founder
Christian rudder has been having some
thoughts maybe it works just because we
tell people it does maybe people just
like each other because they think
they're supposed to I sent some mind
games coming on get out of my head jobs
test their theory the site falsified the
match ratings for some users to see how
it would affect their interaction sure
enough highly compatible couples who
were ranked at just thirty percent
compatibility only exchanged a couple
messages before the conversation fizzled
out whereas incompatible users who were
shown having a ninety percent
compatibility wouldn't shut the hell up
because they thought they were soulmates
Oh dating commercials are already bad
enough we don't need them getting any
more awkward the site said that we were
ninety percent match so we started
chatting and here we are I'm not gay by
the end of the experiment rotor was
clearly able to deduce that if you have
to choose only one or the other the mere
myth of compatibility works just as well
as the truth controversial tests such as
this one raised the question if there's
a line to be crossed when experimenting
on users and where that line is we need
to set some boundaries people what's
next our dating sites going to start
posting fake profile pictures oh aight
everyone already does that depending
it's a scary place folks one minute you
could be chatting with the suggested
love of your life and the next you can
find out at your mom try sleeping now
bro Electronic Arts everyone's favorite
dev and publisher recently launched
their beta of EA access a subscription
service that grants users unlimited
access to a vault of games for just five
bucks a month how cool with that but you
can only play for games right now huh
and it's only for xbox one the five
bucks didn't seem that bad at first
right just label titles include
battlefield 4 medan NFL 25 fifa 14 and
peggle 2 subscribers of the service will
also get to play some unreleased titles
such as dragon age inquisition prior to
launch will then be able to carry over
their progress once they purchase the
game now if you're not a console gamer I
won't blame you for skipping this part
of the video all hail the pc master race
but this netflix approach to video games
does bring about some considerations for
console and PC gamers alike what a
monthly subscription service like this
being effective way to play games and if
so how much should it cost in a war
we're gamers have unlimited access to
every steam game available how much will
one man pay per mon fer absolute gaben
gluttony obviously this largely depends
on your wallet and how often you game
let me know what you guys think about
the concept of gaming subscription
services and how much you'd be willing
to pay for one at the YouTube partner I
frequently visit analytic sites like
social blade and vid stats X and I
always seem to find myself once again
looking at that list of top youtubers
typically with a great sense of
bitterness and loathing PewDiePie
talentless prick Smosh shut up jenna
Marbles yeah i watch your videos on mute
but then i come across the channel
called disney collector BR and it blows
my mind every time because we'll watch
this then sofia the first tea party set
from play-doh that's all it is that's
the whole channel just about your first
person toy porn starring a creepy voice
in a bad manicure and it has 1.8 million
subscribers and 25 billion video views
and this angered me for a long time
because i want that i like money lucky
for me BuzzFeed posted an article this
week discussing the identity and bizarre
success of the youtuber which laid to
rest some of the questions I've been
asking for years like who watches this
crap oh yes it seems the majority of
channel views comes from toddlers ages
two to six most of them using their
parents tablets or smartphones to watch
princess Sofia pop play-doh out of her
but this video of plastic eggs has over
91 million views I've been unboxing the
wrong things my entire life experts
speculate that the mystifying success of
the channel stems from a primal feeling
of excitement the toddlers get from
watching the videos it's almost as if
they're getting high off of the feeling
of actually being given these toys and
after the video ends then you've got to
watch one more and one more and one off
it's like toddler crack what's equally
fascinating is that the woman in the
videos never reveals her face or
identity and none of the YouTube
networks like full screen or maker have
ever been able to contact her making her
the biggest unaffiliated anonymous
youtuber in the world I mean still not
fully understand the phenomenon or how
to target five-year-olds without feeling
like a pedo but I can at least say that
after reading the article I have a
newfound respect for this woman and her
efforts to help a cookie monster with
portion control so from one noble
youtuber to another I tip my hat shake
your poorly painted hand and say
congratulations disney collector whoever
you are that's gonna do for now guys be
sure to like favorite and subscribe feel
free to blow up the comment section down
below thank you all for watching and
I'll see
all next week
you
do on your knees dirty console peasants
bow down before the glorious pc master
race who watches this crap</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
