what's going on guys welcome back so the
other day I was thinking about gamers
who are at a fork in the road trying to
decide between whether they should buy a
new laptop or a new desktop and there
are pros and cons to each obviously with
the desktop you get sort of this
potential for unkept power there's an
upgrade path you can connect all these
cool peripherals to it for just an
overall richer gaming experience but
laptops have their place too if you're
an on-the-go user or if you just prefer
to game afk once in a while so what I
want to try doing today is setting up a
fully dockable battle station that sort
of gets us the best of both worlds and I
want to do that by taking an arsenal of
premium peripherals and connecting them
to this high-end laptop which is the msi
ge62 5 stealth what I hope to gain from
all this is is really a gaming
experience
that's indistinguishable from a desktop
if I can do that while at the same time
allowing us to undock this laptop at a
moment's notice should we want to take
advantage of on-the-go gaming then
that'll be awesome so that's kind of
what we're about today and it should be
pretty exciting I'm stoked
you should be stoked we're all still
alright without further ado let's get
things rolling and start setting things
up now as mentioned the msi gs70 days
setup and it packs a mighty punch with
an 8th gen 6 core i7 8790 h 16 gigs of
DDR 4 memory and a gtx 1070 max q it's
incredible power paired with a beautiful
15.6 inch 1920 by 1080 144 hertz IPS
display though we won't be staring at
that much today
my second favorite piece of tech from
this set up is the pluggable Thunderbolt
3 docking station which is what we'll
connect our peripherals and cat6 cable
to before routing all of it to the
laptop over a single Thunderbolt 3 cable
this is a perfect way to take advantage
of the Thunderbolt IOT's versatility in
high bandwidth while drastically
cleaning up the cable management
and simplifying the docking and
undocking process the one limitation
here is g-sync which is not currently
supported via thunderbolt 3 so we'll be
using the laptops mini display port for
connecting our monitor speaking of will
be hooking up to the asus rog swift PG 3
for 8 q for ultra wide adaptive refresh
goodness additional proofs include the
Logitech G pro mechanical gaming 10
keyless keyboard the corsair m65 pro RGB
and the super exclusive hyper x cloud
alpha gold edition headset which matches
our laptop o so beautifully oh and i
guess we can't forget the highly coveted
bit with super wide desk mat either like
your the description just saying those
my friends are the ingredients for one
ultimate dockable battle station now
let's fire it up and see if it works
all right guys we're all set up here
everything's looking pretty glorious so
far I've got my PC master-race wallpaper
looks beautiful all right let's talk
about this for a minute the GS 64 no CG
is 65 I'm already off to a great start
has a gorgeous display 144 hertz IPS
however it lacks g-sync support
fortunately the gtx 1070 that's inside
of the laptop does support g-sync
and with Ag sync supported display we
can still leverage adaptive refresh rate
with this setup which is beautiful if
you if we open up the Nvidia control
panel here we can see G sync pops up
it's enabled we only have three cables
connected to our laptop which is power
obviously the display port and the
Thunderbolt three of course everything
else is plugged into the pluggable
docking station everything is pretty
much plug and play the only things we
really had to fiddle with were apart
from enabling g-sync where the
resolution stretching that 234 40 by
1440 and our scaling was 200% initially
so everything was all large and
nasty-looking swap that to 100% and
we're good to go now one thing that we
are losing out on actually from this
setup is a bit of a bit of smoothness
perhaps in our refresh rate as I
mentioned the laptop supports up to 144
Hertz whereas this beastly monitor only
supports 100 Hertz but that's okay
because I'd much rather take that small
hit in exchange for juicing support
that's my personal preference you guys
can probably argue about it in the
comments but on that note why don't we
go ahead and jump in to some Far Cry 5
and see how this thing games all right
we are in the game looks like we're
getting around 4050 FPS frame counter
top right if you're interested things
are looking really nice super smooth
right now and you know what the laptop
is is audible very audible but it's not
super loud and even if that bothers you
I mean you're gonna be wearing
headphones or a headset anyway within
game sound and it completely blocks out
any of the white noise coming from the
laptop alright I'm gonna take the
headphones off throw elbows to noise
canceling I can't really hear myself
talk but this feels really smooth I'd be
very curious to see if we could trick
hardcore PC gamers into thinking that
their gaming on a desktop with a setup
like this maybe an apart to follow up or
something like that but I don't know it
might fool me I mean obviously gtx 1070
max-q with lower clocks and stuff is not
going to perform quite the same as a
discrete GPU equivalent but I don't know
this is pretty damn convincing now of
course this setup isn't without its
flaws for one you still do have to dock
and undock the laptop as easy as it is
actually time myself it took five
seconds to dock the laptop but that's
still five seconds of messing around
with three cables and and maybe having
to do that on a daily basis which some
users are not gonna want to have to deal
with the other thing is that it is a
laptop so there's really no easy way to
upgrade the core components like the CPU
or the GPU for example when this GS 65
gets slow one day maybe 2 3 4 years from
now pretty much the only option is to
just buy a new laptop or desktop it's
not very serviceable or upgradable in
that regard the only other problem I
could see running into off the top of my
head here is that you only have one
laptop you only have one device so to
speak it's it's there's no redundancy so
if your laptop goes down or it's out of
service for whatever reason you are Sol
you don't have a backup device whereas
if you had a separate laptop and desktop
you would kind of have sort of a plan B
should one of them kick the bucket and
I'm sure that there are other pros and
cons to this setup that I just haven't
thought of yet in this video so if you
guys have anything in mind share it with
the class down below so now that the Sun
has come up or in the daytime here we're
getting around still around 40 to 50 fps
which isn't that bad when you consider
how many pixels were pushing here
obviously with a lower resolution
monitor I mean not everyone's gaming on
34 40 by 1440 ultra-wide you would see
that start to go up and you could get
you know a pretty good 144 Hertz 1080p
panel for not too much changed these
days and this is really more of a
testament to the horsepower that's built
in to the GS 65 because it is it is
pretty damn smooth all right well this
game is seriously making me nauseous
right now so I'm gonna end things here
this is a cool little experiment that I
think was a huge success I feel like
this whole setup seems impractical but
in practice it actually works really
well and I'm kind of curious to know if
you guys would ever consider using a
setup like this for yourselves let me
know because I feel like it's it's a
very sort of niche appeal here and I'm
kind of curious what you would use this
setup for what's your lifestyle like
those of you who would actually consider
putting something like this up in your
house or apartment or wherever let me
know in the comments below but that's
all I got for now guys so other than
that house like on the video if you
enjoyed it get subscribed so you don't
miss any more stuff like this in the
near future and check us out on
floatplane if you'd like to watch our
videos a week early without ads I'll put
a link for that in the video description
till next time guys thank you so much
for tuning in have yourselves a good one
and I'll see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
