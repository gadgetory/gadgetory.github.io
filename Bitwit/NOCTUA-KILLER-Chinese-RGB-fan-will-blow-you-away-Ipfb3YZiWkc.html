said I was thinking about doing a cheap
RGB fan roundup video until I stumbled
across these guys these are the PC
cooler Corona RGB fans got our own ass
no relation to the Mexican Alcoholic
Beverage but these fans look so good on
paper I figured there was no point in
doing a roundup video if these were just
gonna blow away the competition pun
intended I still got it so before making
said roundup video I decided to pull the
trigger on these and test them out
myself and I gotta say these are the
best budget RGB fans on the market
hands-down nothing has ever come close
or ever will come close and I definitely
won't regret saying those words one day
okay maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit
but these are seriously great fans so
today I'm going to tell you all about
them and why exactly I think they're so
cool pun again oh my god it must be so
great being you watching me I'm jealous
so that's what's on the agenda today
let's start by talking about the fan
itself but not before a word from our

500 there's absolutely nothing to lose
so in the words of Shia LaBeouf just do
it and then the words of Arnold
Schwarzenegger do it now let's talk
about the fan this is the box there's
stuff on the box
these are 120 millimeter PWM fans they
come in a kit of three for 36 US dollars
making them twelve bucks a piece that is
how you map ladies and gentlemen that's
why they used to call me Rain Man the
carry a max airflow of fifty four point
five one CFM a max fan speed of eighteen
rpm and they're using hydraulic bearings
which promotes longer lifespan and
better overall performance the first
thing I noticed when I took these out of
the box was just how high-quality they
look and feel these don't look like $12
RGB fans they look like they could be in
the 15 to 20 maybe even the $25 range
the plastic housing is super solid
there's no flex to the fan whatsoever
however you can probably tell that
they're on the cheap side based on the
side of the fan just on how it looks the
plastic molding isn't quite as premium
looking as say you know your invest in
class not too of course air fans for
example still I would say they look far
from bad and still much better looking
than other fans in its price range each
fan has nine blades that have the sort
of stripe design underneath them and it
looks very similar to like a be quiet
case fan if you guys knew what I'm
talking about there that's the immediate
first thought that I had and if I
remember correctly be quiet uses that
design in order to maximize airflow
while keeping noise to a minimum both
sides of the fan have rubber pads on all
the corners to reduce operating noise
and vibration and the lighting on the
fan itself is actually sort of a ring
lighting kind of like the thermaltake
ring fans that we're familiar with but
these rings are a little skinnier
they're definitely on the thin side
which isn't a bad thing necessarily as
long as the lighting looks good and you
can see it's not a complete ring either
but rather it's broken at four points
along the fan in each of the corners
just to give it more of a stylized
appearance which i think looks pretty
good now one aesthetic choice that I
could see raising some eyebrows here
because it did so for me are the corners
of the fan they kind of have this unique
concave hollow design that I can see not
everyone being into I really didn't like
them in pictures and even in person that
took a while for them to grow on me but
eventually I came around and became a
fan we have two cables coming off of
each fan both of which are sleeved in
black which is very much appreciated we
had a four pin pwm connection this is
fantastic
a lot of RGB fans in the 30 to 40 dollar
price range do not have four pin PWM
connections rather they have some
proprietary plug that goes into a
proprietary included fan controller or
hub that if the hub dies you can't plug
it into a motherboard for example
whereas this you can the other cable
terminates to a three pin connector for
RGB goodness and this is where we can
get into accessories so included is an
adapter that you connect your fans to
and that adapter terminates to a 5 volt
3 pin addressable RGB connector that you
can connect to your motherboard assuming
it has the header or you can plug it
into the included RGB controller that
has mode speed and color selection
unfortunately it is molex power which is
the worst possible thing I have ever
seen in my life
I'm probably being dramatic but it's not
as good as say that most people already
have a few free SATA ports in their
system so requiring molex just forces
some users to have to dig up a molex
cable plug it into their system is it's
a pain in the ass you suck molex you
suck finally you also get a vdg adapter
so you can plug this into a gigabyte
board that supports BBG headers because
they're weird and there's a 3-way 4 pin
PWM splitter so you can plug all three
fans into a single motherboard header if
you want now let's start talking about
performance I actually tested these fans
inside of a system that I had very
recently built for a case review
actually it was for the fractal design
to find us to vision RGB case which you
should check that review out if you
haven't yet but the rig I built in that
video is the one I'm using for all of
today's testing and that system features
a rising 7 1700 yes I know I'm so old
school that's overclocked to 4 gigahertz
on all eight of its core so we have a
fixed frequency that doesn't fluctuate
or give any variance in our testing
cooling our CPU is the asus rog region
360 millimetre liquid AO featuring three
of those fancy Noctua nff 12 IPPC 120
millimeter fans it's also worth noting
that i mounted the radiator at the top
the motherboard is the asus rog
crosshair 7 and that's being paired with
16 gigs of g.skill Trident z RGB ddr4
3200 speed along with an asus rog Strix
r-tx 2080 bear in mind while the CPU is
overclocked or GPU is running fully
stocked for all today's tests and oh
yeah we should also talk about the fans
that's important in a fan video so
there's the 3 Noctua fans that are being
set to exhaust at the top of the case is
part of the AO and then we have for the
prism of fans from fractal design that
came included with the vision of the s2
vision case so we've got 4 140
millimeter Prisma fans at the front and
then one more at the back for exhaust
all those fans are connected to the
Nexus fan hub that came included with
the s2 vision K stand that's what we'll
be connecting or Corona fans to as well
for today's tests now I ran 2 major
tests here one for airflow and one for
static pressure so I tested these both
as case fans and radiator fans just to
see how well-rounded they are for the
airflow test I benchmarked these fans
against the 3 Prisma fans that are at
the
front of the case so I actually did a
10-minute run of GTA 5 at 2560 by 1440
max settings across the board with the
prism of fans initially and then I
swapped them out for the Coronas and ran
the exact same test before checking our
CPU and GPU temps what I found was I
don't have those numbers pulled up let
me just double check sorry okay so with
our Prisma fans our arisin 7 1700 got up
to 59 point eight degrees Celsius and
the corona RGB fans resulted in a
maximum CPU temperature of 60 degrees C
so more or less identical
that's 0.2 degrees certainly within
margin of error the RT X 2080 got up to
58 C under the cool breeze of the
freckled prism of fans and we hit a
maximum 59 see with the Coronas so again
extremely close results here very
impressive when you consider that the
Prisma fans are 140 millimeters as
opposed to 120 on the Coronas the next
logical question is how loud did these
fans get compared to the prism --is
under low now's your chance to flex
those big beautiful ears of yours with a
sound test
imperceptible is a word that I would use
to describe the difference in sound that
these fans delivered compared to the
prisoners I really could not tell a
difference whether I was gaming or
listening to the test that you just
heard in the second benchmark I tested
for static pressure where I pitted these
fans up against the big boy not to us on
our asus rog ryojun 360 AIO and what I
found was holy moly same temperatures
again this is again after the same
10-minute run in GTA 5 at all the same
settings sixty point nine degrees C for
our NOC Tua's vs. 61 C with the Coronas
this was truly surprising because these
are first and foremost advertised as
case fans although on their product page
I do believe they say that they can be
used for static pressure optimized
environments as well but a lot of case
manufacturers say that it doesn't mean
it's necessarily true or that the fans
work well in those environments so I was
very surprised to see that these are
competing performance wise or thermal
wise I should say with much more
expensive not to us that being said
there is still the noise factors so
let's take a listen to our second sound
test
I don't know how well you could hear but
I could definitely tell if the Noctua
fans were noticeably quieter than our
fan of the hour I could even see the
difference in volume level between the
two fans using the decibel meter in
Adobe Premiere Pro having said that
these fans are still super quiet in
practice I mean it literally took me
wearing really nice headphones with a
thousand-dollar microphone position six
inches away from the fans in order to
hear the difference between these and
the nock to us I mean I'm not sure what
else to say here because the benchmarks
really speak for themselves in the fact
that these are performing on par
thermally wise with other fans from
well-known brands that are much more
costly they've also proven themselves to
be acoustically sound so you're not just
getting cool but quiet operation as well
after seeing the raw performance of
these fans I honestly could care less
about the RGV but sure enough the RGB is
impressive too I mean very rich bright
vibrant colors they all transition
smoothly no hot spots whatsoever for the
record I did test it out with both be
included controller and with Asus or a
sync plugged in directly to the
crosshair seven motherboard and
everything worked without a hitch I
think that's all I have to say at the
same time I cannot say enough about
these fans and how impressed they've
left me so guys if you want a link I'll
put it down below if you want to find
out more at 36 bucks 12 bucks a pop
unbeatable
speaking of unbeatable if you think that
these fans can be beat by another budget
RGB fan option in the 30 to $40 price
range leave the name down below in the
comments and maybe we'll have a duel
we'll have a full-on bloodbath okay this
thing has nine blades it will cut you
guys thank you for watching this video
toss a look on it before you go if you
enjoyed it and get subscribed for the
little bit thank you guys for watching
have a good one and I'll see y'all in
the next video baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
