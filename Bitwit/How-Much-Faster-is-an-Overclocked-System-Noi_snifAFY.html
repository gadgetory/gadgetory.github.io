channel today we are doing some
overclocking yes that's right the
age-old topic that's been discussed and
exhausted through and through but we're
going to talk about it again today
there's a couple of reasons why first of
which is because I'm just curious to see
how good this freakin video card is at
overclocking and how fast it is really
this is the galaxy gtx 1070 this is
their EXO c or extreme overclock which
is very hard to get in the u.s. actually
i was only able to go to the gallic
store I had to go there and purchase it
and have it shipped all the way from
China or Taiwan or wherever it comes
from so it's not a very talked about
card however it is gorgeous it's
completely stunning and it's supposed to
be a pretty damn fast GPU in terms of
gtx 1070 speech so today we're going to
be overclocking that as well as the core
i5 6600 k that's in the bill that we
have here of course this looks a little
bit familiar this is December's PC of
the month the epic RGB build and yes
that was the best name I could come up
with at the time I am sorry but the
other reason why I want to talk about
overclocking and how it impacts frame
rates in terms of gaming performance is
because there probably a couple of you
guys out there who are relatively new to
PC building or new to overclocking in
general that might still be on the fence
of whether or not to go ahead and
manually tweak these settings in your
system or your BIOS in order to crank up
the frequencies on your various
components so hopefully by the end of
this video you guys will feel a little
bit less intimidated by overclocking
while seeing what kind of performance
gains it offers at no extra cost to you
now while I'm not touting this video as
a guide or tutorial by any means it
should help you guys understand just how
easy it is to overclock your system
while also understanding its impact on
gaming performance that said before we
dive in just a quick little tiny
disclaimer make sure you understand what
you're getting yourself into the risks
involved with overclocking and how
overclocking a component in your system
might affect your warranty with the
manufacturer every manufacturer is
different and there's a number of
components from different companies that
can be overclocked but they each have
their own set of terms of agreement and
operating standards so make sure that
you do your research before actually
diving in and tweaking anything yourself
so make sure you avoid voiding things
that you don't want voided on that know
let's go ahead and take a quick look at
the specs for rocket here in the RGB
they'll go ahead and watch that video by
the way if you haven't yet we're rocking
and s340 elites from NZXT that is the
chassis all of this hardware is laid
inside of we've also got an asus z170
deluxe motherboard rockin the core i 6
Wow Core i5
6600 K on the skylake platform that's
being cooled by a kraken X 50 to 240
millimeter liquid AIO additionally we've
got 16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance LED Ram
at 3000 megahertz a 1 terabyte crucial
MX 200 SSD with Windows 10 and all of
our applications loaded up on there and
we've also got I believe a 509 in 850
watt power supply don't quote me on that
there's a power supply route so I can't
see it but at the end of the day it
doesn't matter it's a power supply who
cares
so let's go ahead and reboot the system
we're going to boot into the BIOS this
time I'm going to give you guys a quick
little glimpse at my overclock settings
for our 6600 K in there alright or in
the BIOS no we're going to go ahead and
jump into Advanced Mode again this is
the BIOS on the AC so z170 deluxe
motherboards so we're dealing with an
ACC UEFI very nice little BIOS we're
going to go into AI Tweaker so we're
going to go ahead and head over to the
CPU core ratio which is by default set
to auto we're going to go ahead and
switch that to sync all cores and that
essentially applies the same multiplier
to all four of our course which is
exactly what we want we want our
frequency to run on all four of these
cores not just one of them so you can
see here I've already done some dabbling
I dialed in 47 for our multiplier and if
we go up here in the top left it shows
us what our target frequency is once we
boot into the operating system so right
now with a B clock frequency of 100 and
a multiplier of 47 our target frequency
is forty-seven hundred megahertz or 4.1
RF I'm sorry 4.7 gigahertz then we're
going to have to change the voltage as
well
now our CPU core voltage is by default
set to auto we're going to switch that
to manual and you can see I've already
got dialed in one point four volts here
which is the minimum voltage that I
found necessary in order to run this
chip at 4.7 gigahertz stabili anything
less than that and there is a little bit
of instability in certain applications
not all of them and I'm sure depending
on the CPU the 6600 K that you have on
hand you might be able to get away with
more or you might not fare as well
depending on the ASIC quality of that
particular chip which we'll talk about a
little bit more later
now some to bear in mind with manual
mode is that whatever voltage you set in
here will
on 100% of the time it doesn't matter if
your CPU is under load or if it's idling
it will run at one point four three
volts 24/7 and that introduces
unnecessary heat into your system and
there's no real reason why you need to
run at this voltage all the time so what
I would suggest to you guys at home is
actually go with offset mode and what
that does it allows your voltage to
scale dynamically with whatever your CPU
frequency is so as soon as you go from
loads to idle it'll actually scale down
and roll back your frequency as well as
your voltage in order to keep things a
little bit cooler and more reasonable in
terms of the voltage that's being sent
to your CPU while configuring your
voltage with offset mode can be a little
tricky at first there's plenty of guides
and tutorials on how exactly to do that
but for the purpose of this video just
to keep things simple so we can jump
right in
we're going to stick to manual mode at
1.43 volts we're going to go ahead and
save our settings into the OS and run a
quick little stability test so here's a
look at our CPU running prime95
and just a quick disclaimer if you are
going to be stress testing with p95 I
would suggest using a version that's
26.6 or earlier because anything after
that is known to produce just extreme
extremely high and unrealistic
temperatures for for reasons that go
beyond my head right now that I can't
really remember but I would have liked
to use 86 before but my free trial ran
out and I'm too cheap to buy a license
anyway cpu-z right here forty-seven
hundred megahertz right where our target
core clock was supposed to be that's
looking good and our core voltage has
gone up to one point four four bolts
actually again this is a high voltage
for you to be running at 24/7 but for
the purpose of this video that'll do
just fine
so I think on that notes we've been
running this for about five to ten
minutes now it's looking pretty stable I
think we're safe to go ahead shut this
down at least stop the test here and
start overclocking our gtx 1070 alright
so i've got the image in heaven-- 4.0
running in the background here and we've
got msi afterburner open as well as GPU
v and just a little background a little
context on the galaxy CX 1070 that we're
dealing with here today it actually has
a boost clock out of the box it is
factory overclocked with a boost clock
of 1700 and 83 which is about a hundred
megahertz higher already than the
reference stock speeds of the gtx 1070
but you can see here due to GPU boost
3.0 we're actually seeing a boost clock
of 1923 which is significantly more
then what the out-of-the-box spec says
simply because we are well within our
power and temperature limits that we can
set manually so I'm going to crank these
to 100 just so we can continue getting
the most out of our boost clock there
and then we're going to we're not going
to touch voltage for this video that's
for topic for another video
we are going to go ahead and tweak our
CPU core clock here so our GPU core
clock I should say I already set this to
130 I believe and that seems stable
that's anything more than that I was
started starting to artifact and
actually crashing out and also 375 I
believe was the no no 360 360 I can just
type this in 360 megahertz on the memory
clock was the highest clock there that I
was able to achieve fan speed on auto
we're going to go ahead and save that
you're going to see our boost clock jump
up from 1923 to hopefully something more
impressive than what you see here did I
applied that correctly boom alright
there it is so now we're running at just
over 2 gigahertz on the GPU core clock
and twenty one hundred and eighty one
point six megahertz on the memory clock
the GPU temp is also going to go up a
little bit just because we are running
the card a little bit faster now but
still seventy-six degrees Celsius up
seventy-seven oh boy
getting warmer that's still relatively
safe operating temperatures again this
is just to see how far we can take this
and it looks like Unigine Heaven 4.0 is
still running just fine I don't see any
artifacting from too high of a memory
clock or anything like that so I think
at this point we have our CPU and our
GPU clock are over clocks running stable
they are set and I think we should just
run some benchmarks comparing results
with the fully stock version of this of
the system versus the over clocks that
we've just put into place right here and
we're going to go ahead and circle back
talk about the results and close this
video out with some closing words and
conclusions so in that notes let's fire
up the benchmarks and see how our frame
rates were affected by our over clocks
alright so there you guys have the
numbers and clearly every single game
that we tested saw some kind of benefit
from simply overclocking our system
obviously some games benefited more than
others but at the end of the day there
was still a positive percentage increase
in terms of our average frame rate the
overall average percentage increase
across all six of those applications was
seven point six percent so we saw a
seven point six overall seven over
between seven and eight percent of an
increase just from simply tweaking our
clock speeds here now while that's all
fun and dandy something to be aware of
is that your mileage when overclocking
may vary depending on a number of
factors the first of which is ASIC
quality so not all chips are created
equal some chips whether it be CPU or
GPU overclock better than others and
that's why you see companies like EVGA
for example with their lot with the last
generation of Nvidia cards we're selling
the kingpin editions of their graphics
cards I believe that was the gtx 980ti
that they were doing that with but the
kingpin editions basically promised
users a higher ASIC quality chip that
would be good at overclocking definitely
better than something that you would
just randomly by that wasn't advertised
as being a great overclocker
that's not to say you can't get lucky
and hit the silicon lottery so to speak
it happens all the time but it's never a
guarantee unless the manufacturer or
vendor specifically says it is a big
chip and granted again you will be
paying a premium if that is the case
another contributing factor that helps
determine overclocking potential is your
cooling situation so if you have an
Intel or AMD stock cooler you're not
going to be able to get away with the
same clock speeds that we hit today heat
is essentially the arch-nemesis of
computer hardware and if you're
increasing your clock speeds and your
voltages you're making your system run
faster and work harder which produces
more heat and if you don't have the
adequate or proper cooling solutions put
into place then you could run into
things like thermal throttling which is
when your Hardware actually exceeds it's
safe operating temperature and thus has
to automatically dial back or dial down
the clock speed in order to get back
into that safe thermal zone pushing your
system to the limit without proper
cooling can also cause your system to
shut itself down as a fail-safe in order
to prevent any kind of physical damage
from happening on your hardware so
always make sure you stay cool stay in
school and they'll be a fool I'm gonna
go jump in the pool
so with that said guys I think that's
enough Kyle rambling for one day so I'm
going to leave you guys with this
overclock your should
do your research first don't be scared
and enjoy the extra performance it's
totally worth every single penny that
you won't be spending on it but here's a
question how many of you guys are
overclocking your own systems at home
and which components do you find
yourselves overclocking the most your
CPU your GPU your memory cat I know
someone's overclock overtaxed so please
do share your specs and your
overclocking settings I can't wait to
read all about them in the comments
below until next time guys be sure to
toss me a like on this video I know it
was a little bit more like introductory
beginners high-level contents but if you
want to see more of it let me know in
the comments and I'll be sure to think
of some more stuff along these lines
till next time guys have a good one
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already and I will see y'all in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
