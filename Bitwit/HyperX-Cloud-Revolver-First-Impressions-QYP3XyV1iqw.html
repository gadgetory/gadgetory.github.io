welcome back today I'm going to be doing
a first impressions video on this
particular gaming headset this is the
HyperX cloud revolver it just went on
pre-order April 1st April Fool's Day so
it's not a joke you can actually
pre-order it now and many of you guys
are probably already familiar with hyper
X's cloud line of gaming headsets
they've already released the original
cloud and the cloud twos a few few
months back and both of them are really
well praised by the the gaming community
and we're going to take a look at this
one this is the newest addition to the
family the cloud family however you'll
notice from the box right away that it
looks very different than the cloud that
we're used to so hopefully we still get
the same amount of performance in terms
of sound quality that is as well as
build quality that we've seen from that
line of products so without further ado
I'm gonna go ahead and slice this guy
open
OOP I should I should preface this video
by saying that I have checked out this
headset once for a brief moment at CES
this year back in January I stopped by
the Kingston slash HyperX booth and they
let me put these things on give him a go
however I was in a really crowded room
in a tether suite and it was noisy so I
didn't get a really good gauge on how
they actually sounded they sounded good
from what I could tell but I really I'm
really excited to check them out in a
more controlled environment today so if
I can get this thing off there we go
comes in a very nice package you've got
some nice little writing on here message
from HyperX that no one will ever read
here this is what it looks like in the
box I also haven't done like an unboxing
just a straight-up unboxing on the
channel and while that's not exactly
what this is it's kind of nice to be
doing one of these after a while let's
see we've got the headset and a boom mic
which obviously it's a detachable and is
there anything else underneath this
beautiful foam nope that's it so I guess
we'll talk about the mic first since
it's already detached in stuff it's a
boom Pole it's flexible you can kind of
flex it and it stays so you can position
it you know either further away or
closer to your mouth it's got a 3.5
millimeter jack right there and oh my
favorite part of unboxings is taken the
plastic plastic wrap off I don't know if
it's the note it's got to be the noise I
think the noise is what's satisfying
listen
Oh every time who even got bonus rap on
the edges of the ear cups like a bat
look it this is this is I would pay 120
bucks for this I don't know if I
mentioned that it's 120 bucks so it's
about what the cloud choose where I
think the cloud choose were maybe a
hundred maybe the cloud twos were a
hundred and the original clouds clouds
were discounted to like 80 I think after
the cloud to use came out but let me go
ahead and just put these suckers on
first give him a go ah are these even on
the right way
okay these are on backwards I got this
you know what they're they're a lot
lighter than they look because they're
they're a little bit bulky just because
of the the giant headband but you
realize that it's completely Hollow and
it's super thin because it just uses
this elastic band on the inside with a
with a foam with a foam headband so it's
very light even the ear cups are super
light almost to the point where like the
build quality doesn't feel quite as
strong or durable as the cloud of the
cloud toos I would say however they're
equally comfortable at least you know in
the first five seconds maybe even more
comfortable than the cloud twos because
I remember the cloud twos the one gripe
I had with them was was clamping force
they were a little bit snug on my head
particularly jeez sorry about any cars
driving by load by a busy street but you
know that's not a problem as much
clamping force I can deal with the cloud
tubes because you can just stretch that
out over time but these are super
comfortable there's a memory foam I
believe on the ear pads I've also got
like I said cushioned head pant headband
the the frame here is actually steel so
um that's nice I was worried that it was
gonna be plastic I couldn't remember
from CES it was plastic or steel however
something to be aware of is with the
stretchy ear ear headbands whatever it's
called the headbands the elastic ones
elastic will deteriorate over time you
know depending on how much you use it
and also the quality of it will
determine how much mileage you get out
of it and I think these are going to
last you know long long as you need them
to but that's something to be aware of
if you plan on having these a pair of a
gaming headset for ten years then the
elasticity on this is not going
be the same as it is out of the box so
that's something to be aware of as far
as the aesthetics go I am I don't know I
think it looks a little kind of cheesy
just on the ear cups of bits kind of
glassy I don't like the gloss if it was
matte there was more matte pieces like
the other cloud to use I think I'd be a
little happier with that complete
preference that's the thing about gaming
peripherals is that a lot of it's
subjective so what I'm saying right now
could not apply to any of you it's not
like I'm running benchmarks here so the
ear cups themselves are plastic the like
I said the the frame around the headband
this really thin piece is a steel which
is nice and it feels very very rugged
even when I flex the ear cups like so so
that's good but the the ear cups
themselves are plastic as well as the
the HyperX emblem kind of design stuff
on the outside there so moving on to the
cable we've got a nice a very nice
sleeved braided cable which is not
detachable from the ear cut piece so
that is tethered there I like the fact
that HyperX what do they do with it
where is it where's it fell on the floor
so I like the fact that they included
this adapter here so it's a microphone
clip it's got your your audio adjustment
you can also mute it as a mute switch on
there but the fact that this has to has
has both the audio and a microphone jack
means the headphones themselves don't
have to have two plugs which makes them
more convenient for for traveling and
listening to audio and stuff like that
another thing about these is that I'm
pretty sure that they're closed back
which makes them also kind of forgiving
when you're listening to them in public
if you're wearing them in public people
next to you won't be able to hear every
little bit and detail of what you're
listening to and I think on that note
I'm gonna fire these up with my with my
phone here listen to some tunes oh it's
not playing play oh so I think I know
the problem guys basically the mobile
data
my mobile data doesn't work for crap in
this house so I'm always connected to
the Wi-Fi however right now I can't
connect to the Wi-Fi because my phone's
currently connected to the gh4 that's
filming me right now so I'm because I'm
using the image app to you know record
and focus myself and things like that so
we're gonna need a new sound plane what
are those things called but alright
nexus7 you're up do I have spot don't
tell me I don't have Spotify on here yes
I do
login I don't remember my login we're
good
no what happened unable to login
oh I'll just try again did it work yes I
think I'm in playlists uh II D em yeah
yeah guys it sounds it sounds pretty
good I mean I don't have the cloud to
use on hand with me to actually do a an
a/b comparison directly but it's it
sounds about as good as I remember the
cloud to sounding if that helps anyone
bass is super tight and punchy and
granted I've only listened to one song
but I mean instantly I can tell you it's
probably good for listening to music
just as well as it is for playing games
and stuff like that on that note again
on that note on that note let's let's
play some games with this well not with
this we're gonna plug this into computer
and we're gonna play games on a computer
so we can listen to these alright
friends
we've got h1z1 firing up right now this
is probably the best first-person
shooter that I had on hotline but this
game does require you to use your all
your senses well not taste but you
definitely have to like use your ears I
guess have to use your ears and lots of
games I don't know what I'm saying okay
so going down two minutes in and the
headphones are still comfortable I can
confirm you guys forgive me I'm really
really I don't know how to play this
game I mean Steve briefly walked me
through it
oh now my phone's ringing go away no
that song is copy written oh I see
someone that is not a homie
okay I can hear the gunshots I believe
they came from this direction if I'm
right then that's that's a good good
mark for the headphones oh hey hey don't
kill me oh geez
come on man well you know what this
proves it proves that you can hear where
the gunshots are coming from with the
cloud revolvers that's so my death was
not in vain
Oh people getting shot people dying not
me I'm a survivor
Oh oh no no no I should probably get the
hell out of here let's just run on this
wide-open bridge where there's
absolutely no cover whatsoever
completely exposed that's okay because
you know what they don't have a cloud or
bulb or headset and they don't they
can't hear where I'm coming from because
their audio sucks oh it's so bright my
eyes
oh dude dude I heard that I heard that
louder ballers and it sounded it sounded
like an explosion so that's that's a
good sign oh oh I see someone I
heard him with the cloud revolvers I
knew exactly where he was look at him
look at that he's coming here oh
 no
my god
oh he sees me
oh no come on what what what happened
what what what all right well um I'm
pretty happy with how they sound
honestly I could hear everything fine
and don't let my poor gaming skills
reflect the sound quality of the headset
yeah they sound good I could easily tell
where gunshots were coming from and and
footsteps as well but yeah I would say
overall pretty solid as you can see
we're loading up GTA 5 right now because
as you all know part of a gaming headset
isn't just the cans themselves but also
the quality of the microphone so we're
gonna jump into a public server see what
people think can anyone hear me anybody
is anybody helped uh here's anybody nope
no one's in the server I'm talking to
myself hey can you guys hear me
no do I sound alright how do I sound
fine
is there any kind of like static or
ambient noise though the others files
kind of quiet just kind of quiet alright
that's probably just lying alright
thanks guys see you later I love you dad
I love you too you son all right guys so
what's the deal with these things um
honestly it's a good gaming headset I
don't have much to complain about in
terms of the execution it sounds good
it's comfortable I was wearing it for
about half an hour while I was playing
games and I didn't get tired tired of it
at all the ear pads are super comfy and
the the headband as well the microphone
we know is at least good enough for
people to understand what the hell I'm
saying in-game so that's a good thing
and overall it's just it's just solidly
well packaged unit now the gripe that I
have with it however is at 120 dollars
MSRP it's only 20 bucks or it is 20
bucks more than the cloud tubes which
are already a really good headset so the
problem I have here is I don't know if
the 20 bucks is worth the revolver I
think I would just probably go with the
cloud 2 simply because the sound quality
is about the same in my opinion from
both headsets and comfort level is about
on par as well the the big differences
are the design the aesthetic you know
the cosmetically which one you like
better and also maybe personal
preference on whether or not you like
the elastic type of headband or just a
fixed one like the cloud twos um so yeah
but that's pretty much it guys those are
my first impressions if you want to get
if you want to catch a deal on these
maybe wait for them to be out for a
little a little bit before you pull the
trigger but if you want more information
or you want to buy them or pre-order
them I should say there's a link in the
description below but that's going to do
it for now guys let me know if you like
this kind of first impression super
unscripted type of video I know it's I
mean I know it's like off-the-cuff and
kind of crappy but I don't know I had a
fun time making it and hopefully enjoyed
watching it so if you did toss me a like
on this video feel free to subscribe to
the channel for more tech videos this is
making making too much noise on the mic
me moving around my too fidgety for you
much more fidgety again thanks for
watching guys stay tuned for more tech
videos coming at you really soon and
I'll see you all in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
