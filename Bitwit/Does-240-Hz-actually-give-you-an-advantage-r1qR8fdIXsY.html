the channel hope you're all doing well
today we are going to be discussing high
refresh rate gaming what it all means if
it's worth your hard-earned dollars can
you even see a 240 Hertz display for
example which is exactly what I have
behind me here this is the asus rog
swift PG 2 v 8 and that's a long model
number so I'm just going to call it the
PG the pig we'll call it the pig so I
get the pig over here 240 freaking hurts
can you even see that or how does that
even compare to say a hundred Hertz
display and that's what we have over
here on my right which is the Acer
predator X 3400 Hertz display both of
both of these are g-sync supported so
we're going to be comparing and
contrasting the two of those today to
find out is 240 Hertz worth it can you
actually see it now before we actually
get into that I kind of want to just
take a step back for those of you who
might be new to this whole high refresh
rate gaming thing and just talk about
refresh rate and what it exactly means
and I think we have to rewind a little
bit further even and talk about frame
rates first because often times frame
rate and refresh rate get confused and
they're really not the same thing so
frame rate which is often analyzed in
terms of frames per second is really how
many frames your GPU or your graphics
card can render in one second and then
all those frames get sent to the display
via a display cable we're using
DisplayPort for both of these panels in
this instance and then your monitor
determines how many of those frames get
displayed to you per second so we have
right earlier I had csgo
fired up on here with both my gtx 980ti
s in sli and we were easily hitting the
300 frame rate cap we are getting around
300 frames per second now does that
necessarily mean that your eyes are
seeing 300 frames per second no it does
not because the monitors refresh rate is
actually sort of the limiter here or the
bottleneck if you will so even though
let's say on the the Acer predator X 34
here even though we're getting 300
frames per second at a hundred Hertz
refresh rate we're only updating or
refreshing those pixels 100 times every
second so really there are 200 frames
that are not being accounted for though
your eyes never see there's a bunch of
lost data in that process whereas with
the 240 Hertz display you're getting a
lot more than you would with a
Hertz display and refresh rate is really
just how many times a second it's
measured in Hertz first of all and it
measures how many times per second are
the pixels on screen being updated or
drawn in a way you could say that even
if you had a super robust graphic
solution like the one I'm running right
here you could still maybe not get the
best experience if you're limited by a
low refresh rate monitor let's say a 30
Hertz or even a 60 Hertz display could
lead to certain symptoms if the refresh
rate is low enough and your frame rate
is exceeding it bye-bye enough then
certain symptoms you might experience
could be visible choppiness or perceived
stuttering things like that or the image
could look blurry that's you know that
blur is essentially your brain trying to
make sense of these images that are
being displayed in sequence and trying
to turn that into the illusion of motion
another issue that you could experience
with low refresh rate panels is input
lag and input lags basically the time it
takes between a user's action let's say
clicking the mouse to fire your weapon
and the time that that's displayed on
the screen to provide a quick example
those of you who own home theater pcs
that you've connected to your TVs may
have experienced a significant amount of
input lag especially if you've tried
firing up a fast paced shooter not only
is this effect super annoying but since
you're essentially gaming out of sync
there's a disconnect that's happening in
your brain that can negatively impact
your accuracy or your precision while
you're gaining it can really hamper the
overall experience on top of input lag
there's another symptom that I like to
refer to as enemy lag which is sort of a
made-up term by me and that's
essentially the latency or the time it
takes between in enemies actions or
maybe even the in-game environments
movements or changes and what you're
seeing on your screen to set up an
example of what I mean by this let's
take a look at this mouse cursor that's
moving back and forth rapidly across a
screen let's say this is a 60 Hertz
display that we're looking at now you
can see that there's several instances
of that mouse cursor so you can actually
see that there's several copies if you
will now each one of those copies sort
of is a point where the monitor has
refreshed all the pixels on screen now
if we do that same thing on a 240 Hertz
display you can see that there are many
more copies of that cursor and that's
because even though both of these
displays are being fed the same amount
of data the 240 Hertz panel is able to
update the pixels four times
faster than the 60 Hertz display which
explains why we're able to see the
cursor movement with finer granularity
now applying this test to gaming let's
say the cursor is now your enemy that's
running across the screen and so let's
say he's starting behind a wall so you
can't quite see him yet but he's about
to run out from behind the wall so that
you can take a shot at it now assuming
you're gaining on a 60 Hertz monitor
that means your retinas are receiving an
updated image of your enemy 60 times a
second or every 16.6 six milliseconds so
it would look perhaps something like
this at this refresh rate the enemy
almost seems to teleport out from behind
the wall giving you your first
opportunity to shoot them in the face
now it's not that your enemy actually
teleported that's just how long it took
your display to send you the data and
the information of his whereabouts now
if we pair that scenario with the 240
Hertz display you're now being updated
with your enemy's location around every
four milliseconds or 240 times per
second which is why you can kind of see
him come around that corner a bit sooner
than you were able to with the 60 Hertz
panel giving you a clear shot of his
face a fraction of a second sooner now
before you start saying oh no wonder I
keep getting killed in csgo it's because
everyone must have 240 Hertz displays
that's not necessarily the case because
in order to actually take advantage of
that super fast refresh rate your own
reflexes need to be able to keep up with
it essentially what I'm saying is the
one bottleneck of 240 Hertz gaming is
you that's why these super high refresh
rate panels are often aimed at
professional eSports players who have
lightning-fast reflexes where the
difference between life or death boils
down to a matter of milliseconds but for
the vast majority of us I would say the
real benefit of high refresh rate
monitors comes more so from the visual
improvements like the added fluidity the
overall smoothness the perceptible
sharpness that you get more so than the
competitive edge that really only those
with super fast reflexes are going to
notice and take advantage of so
hopefully that information is digestible
and clarifies a few things for those of
you who are new to all this but before
we close a video I want to quickly
address what my own personal experiences
were with 240 Hertz gaming so going from
a hundred Hertz to 240 was a very slight
visual improvement I noticed a bit more
sharpness it was visibly more fluid
smooth but overall I was like why would
I pay extra for this and then I
continued to game on the 240 Hertz panel
for the next 35 45 minutes and then when
I switched back to the 100 Hertz display
it seemed like a sluggish nightmare okay
it wasn't that bad but it definitely
felt slow in comparison to the pig over
here giving my brain enough time to
adjust to a high refresh rate allowed me
to see how slow in comparison 100 Hertz
was on a gaming monitor now that being
said I'm gonna categorize all gamers
into three groups and this is just my
own interpretation it's by no means an
end-all truth or anything like that this
is just what I would think there's my
theory here so I think there's a small
group of people who will see no
difference whatsoever going from a
hundred to two hundred and forty Hertz
and then there's another small group of
people about the same size of the first
one who will see a drastic improvement
visually going making that same jump and
then there's the majority of us who kind
of fall somewhere in the middle where I
would put myself that sees maybe a
slight visual improvement going from a
hundred to two hundred and forty now
that improvement for the majority of us
is so slight that I wouldn't call it a
worthwhile investment to buy a 240 Hertz
display at all I think maybe a hundred
Hertz is great because I think going
from sixty Hertz to 100 Hertz for most
people would agree that there's probably
a bigger visual gap there than there is
going from a hundred to two hundred and
forty it gets increasingly expensive if
you go from one hundred and forty-four
Hertz to 240 you're paying more
considering that all the other specs of
that of those panels are the same I
think professional gamers and those with
super keen eyes are going to see the
most value out of these types of
monitors and at the end of the day guys
you just got it's something that you got
to try for yourself go ahead and see and
experience a high refresh rate two
hundred and forty Hertz display for
yourself and that's really the only way
that you can measure how valuable it is
to you because everyone at the end of
the day with this sort of thing is
completely different but that's going to
do it for now guys that's we're going to
wrap things up and thank you so much for
tuning in be sure to toss me a like on
