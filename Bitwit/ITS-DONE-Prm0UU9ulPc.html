been waiting for for so long and you
guys been waiting a long time to I'm
sorry to have dragged this out for so
long
but today we're both you and I for the
first time we're finally gonna get to
see hot line to complete and pop top and
the last big thing we have to do for the
build is figure out the fluid color so
we've got some ek cryo fuel solid white
this is a pastel color and we've got a
few dyes to mix in to try to get the the
exact same pink that's found in our
custom sleeved cables from the folks
over at and sourced it's gonna be tricky
because this is a sort of neon pink it's
unique to end sourced and you can't just
find a premade fluid that matches that
color so we're gonna have to make it
ourselves which is hopefully not gonna
be too big of a problem now there is a
concern here with colored coolant of any
kind clogging up your loop and degra
nating performance over time which I've
seen firsthand with the elite build and
I am definitely concerned about that and
thinking about that as I go about this
project but here's the thing
hot line too in my book needs to have
pink fluid in order to pay proper homage
to the original that being said that's
just for the video that's for all the
sexy b-roll and once I'm done with this
video and done with production I may
very well swap out that beautiful pink
fluid for basical distilled water just
for long-term use if I'm gonna be gaming
on this thing for the next year or so I
don't want to have any problems down the
way I want to sort of minimize the
amount of risk it kind of takes both the
boxes that way we get to see the rig the
way it's intended to look with the nice
pink fluid but we can swap it out
shortly after so we don't encounter any
issues down the line so that's what
we're doing today I can't wait to see
this thing finish I say we just jump
right in and start playing with our
fluids wow that sounded really
disgusting I'm sorry
okay well that was surprisingly quick
and easy we only had to do one testing
run we didn't even have to use our our
second test tube right there it was
really straightforward we just started
adding dyes that we thought made sense
starting with red and once it got to red
we started balancing it out with a
little bit of pink this pink is sort of
like a fuchsia so there's a bit of
purple to it which there's also a bit of
purple to these cables as well so we
just kept you know guessin checking
taking a look at it just sort of
eyeballing it a head white piece Austin
you're helping me as well until we found
what looks to match almost perfectly and
what we did to get that was four drops
of red and nine drops of pink and that
was with this amount of fluid of course
which we should measure right now so
we're gonna measure this out it's a
right about 100 milliliters so for every
hundred milliliters of fluid we need
four drops of red and nine drops of pink
meaning all we have to do now is drain
the system measure out how much fluid is
actually going into this loop do some
quick math and they'll be able to tell
how many drops of each dye we need to
make the color just right all right
all right the build is done and it looks
beautiful you guys will see the whole
spread of b-roll in just a moment but a
couple things to point out before I show
to you guys the first thing is that the
dye the dye color put it in the loop to
discover that it was still way too dark
the color was right it was just too rich
and dark so I lightened it up with some
additional white coolant until it became
the color that I wanted and now it is
matching beautifully also the internal
LED strip on one of the r-tx 20 80 TI
water blocks actually had its wiring
come undone it just completely popped
off and I attempted to solder it back on
it took me I spent about an hour hour
and a half trying to do this guys it's
really pathetic but I could not do it
I'm just a new bit soldering and I don't
really have a good solder kit it's a
really cheap kit and the solder points
on this LED strip which is very tiny for
inexperienced solder er solder is so not
being able to get one of the GPUs
illuminated I felt it was only right to
disable the other one to make it fair it
also just doesn't make a lot of sense to
me to only have one GPU lit up I turned
both of them off so you'll please
forgive the lack of our GP on the GPUs
but everything else in the system is for
lack of a better term lit and I do mean
that in the most literal and figurative
way possible I am absolutely in love
with the end result I hope you guys are
too and I'm sure you're dying to see the
finished product by now so without
further ado ladies and gentlemen it is
my great honor to present to you the one
the only hot line to
and there she blows
Letty's well well well not too shabby eh
maybe maybe you guys hate it I feel like
this is a lover hate belt I completely
understand it people are like yeah but I
like it I really do but a couple things
note here
this is looking a little bare this
little fan mounting area and there's no
way that a standard 25 millimeter thick
fan can fit here because of the two
fittings coming from the radiator which
is kind of a bummer I would have loved
to put another ll series fan here to add
some more lighting to this side of the
case but what can you do I was kind of
thinking it might be cool if I got the
old CPU from hot line one and like
somehow mounted it back here just kind
of again to pay homage to the original
might be a cool little thing to add in
here I'm not exactly decided yet but
we'll figure it out in case you're
wondering all of the RGB elements in
this system are connected to the
motherboard with the exception of the
LED strips and the l-series fans which
are both from Corsair that's hooked up
to a lighting node Pro so it's all being
configured within the IQ software but
everything else that's connected to the
board is being controlled with Asus aura
and between both of those softwares I
was able to get a very consistent shade
of pink for all the devices and nto I'm
teal for that matter so it's matching
pretty nicely and I think it's it's
looking good I am gonna try my best to
get a replacement LED strip for this
bottom GPU here so we can actually
illuminate the end of these cards as
well as the actual text here the GeForce
r-tx
I believe the ek logo on the side lights
up as well if I can get that sort of out
great and if not it's not a huge deal
honestly I'm happy with how the system
looks as is I don't know how well you
can hear it but the fan noise right now
isn't the best because I haven't
configured anything on that end so
they're all just spinning up their fixed
rpm we got six bands in here total so
it's a little noisy at the moment but
that's something we'll address in a
future video as well as overclocking our
9900 K and our SLI RTX 2080 ti setup
should be pretty awesome we'll be doing
some benchmarking thermal testing as
well you can sort of see the the CPU
temp readout that digital readout on our
Maximus 11 formula it's hovering around
the low 30s sometimes even in the high
20s so things looking good so far but
to tell exactly how this thing performs
under load but I think that's pretty
much it so I'm gonna end the video here
guys thank you very much for watching be
sure to congratulate me in the comments
on my new build I'm very excited I need
to fix this damn table
why does I walk before you go be sure to
toss a look on the video if you enjoy it
and get subscribed for more tech content
on the way including a follow-up video
to this guy where we finally get to see
it in action should be pretty sweet
guys thank you so much for watching have
a good one and I'll see you all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
