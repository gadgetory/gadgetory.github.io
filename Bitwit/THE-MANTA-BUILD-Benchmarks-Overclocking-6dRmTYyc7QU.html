channel apologies in advance I'm not
going to be showing my face much in this
here video nor is it going to be a
particularly lengthy or detailed video
because I'm sick I'm super sick I'm all
nasally and congested it's is disgusting
you guys definitely don't want to see
what's behind this camera right now but
making good with my promise I did want
to show you guys some benchmarks and
some just some follow-up information on
the good old man to build which I'm
still thinking of a name for honestly I
haven't given it too much thought and
you guys had some really good
suggestions on the last video where I
asked you for some for some ideas
however I'm pretty sure PC make a pee
face is not going to make the cut sorry
about that but I will let you guys know
whether it's on Twitter or in another
video what I decide on to call this here
system so for now I just wanted to give
you guys a bit of a rundown on what I've
been experiencing so far what the data
looks like after testing this thing for
an entire day so I've got a couple
things up here right now I've got two
instances of cpu-z on the right we just
see our memory we've got 16 gigs of DDR
4 it's running its stock speeds we
haven't overclocked it at all and then
on the left here you get some
information about our CPU itself the
core i7 6700 K which is what we're
rocking in here you can see right here
it's it's spiking up to 4.6 gigahertz
which is what I've overclocked it to
that is dipping a little bit below that
because we're not fully maxing out the
CPU here in Unigine hebben 4.0 this has
been going for about 15 or 20 minutes
now mind you so we dialed in a 46 core
multiplier and that's that believe 1.38
bolts on if you look over here we can
see our temperatures for each of our
cores on that on that CPU and we're
spiking up to 64 degrees Celsius on the
hottest chip now that's actually not
terrible however when I was testing this
earlier yesterday I did notice it
getting into the like high 70s actually
two or three of the cores were thin high
70s and I don't know if that's exactly
kosher for a custom water-cooled loop I
mean I don't have too much experience
with these things I know hot line gets
to maybe about mid 70s low 70s at the
very worst when I'm gaming
however that's on a 59 60 X and it's
clocked much slower than the 6760 700 K
here so let me know guys all of you
water cooling aficionados if like high
70s for an overclocked 6700 K custom
water-cooled is normal but apart from
that performance has been really good
I'm about to show you guys the
benchmarks in just a bit but before I do
that I wanted to bring up the overclock
settings that I used for my GPU as well
let's take a look here these are
precision decks to do my overclocking
and of course we maxed out the power and
temp target sliders to 120 % and 92
degrees Celsius respectively and here
you can see I've dialed in a 210
megahertz offset which is actually
pretty nice as well as a 200 megahertz
offset for the memory clock speed also
over here I usually don't mess around
with the voltage on my GPUs just because
I prefer the longevity and I usually
don't feel like I need the voltage all
that much but it's a special occasion
with the Mantid belt so I've cranked it
up to about 30 millivolts here and
that's helped us to achieve a few extra
megahertz in the the clock speed of
course and a bit more stability for our
overclock and over here you can kind of
just see what what we're looking at here
in terms of the output for these
overclock settings so our core clock we
were able to hit 2.1 gigahertz just
barely I did see it go above this just
maybe about by about 13 or 14 megahertz
in our testing yesterday but right now
it's hovering at 2100 megahertz and even
when I'm not I guess when I'm not doing
the max and you're just seeing it go
regularly it's it's stabilizing at 2088
megahertz it does spike up to 2.1
gigahertz occasionally but but it's not
too bad and then also we've got 1300
Flatts megahertz on the memory clock now
this is a pretty toasty right here 52
degrees Celsius compared to what it was
yesterday oh you can actually hear the
system ramping up right now it's getting
a little hot in here it's also because
it's let me check
it is 81 degrees Fahrenheit in my room
that's the ambient temperature right now
81 degrees which is pretty warm actually
I just woke up the a/c hasn't been on
all night
so granted you might need to cut it some
slack in my testing yesterday I ran
through seven applications and I didn't
see it get past fifty degrees Celsius so
it's a little bit warmer right now
because the morning and you know a/c
hasn't been running that ambient temps
are a little bit high as far as memory
used it's only showing about two gigs of
memory right here but actually yesterday
the vram maxed out at six and a half
gigabytes so I'm getting close to
utilizing that full eight gigs of DDR 5x
which is kind of nice to see us actually
taking advantage of all that I believe
that spike during GTA 5 with everything
maxed out which is definitely a VRAM
eater and then down here we're at 118 %
TDP of our power consumption and that's
that's pretty damn close to our 120
percent limit here so that's why I
didn't want to push the the voltage any
further because otherwise we could have
been going over that limit and you know
the video card probably would have been
demanding more wattage as opposed to
voltage at that point but in terms of
voltage we maxed out at one point zero
seven five volts which isn't too bad so
those are the overclock settings that I
used guys let me know what you think so
far and I think on that note we're going
to go ahead and switch it over to an
acoustics test so we can see what this
thing sounds like when idling as well as
under load and that will just jump into
sim to some gaming benchmarks which I
ran at 14:40 P as well as 4k I left out
1080 entirely simply because this is
quite an overpowered system for that
resolution so here it is guys
enjoy
you
you
all right so they're happy guys let me
know what you think of the results so
far also if you have any last minute
name suggestions while I still Mull this
over for the system go ahead and leave
them in the comments below that's gonna
do it for now y'all thank you for
watching go ahead and toss me a like on
it if you enjoyed it and subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already
thanks I'm gonna go douse myself with
with cough medicine now and and probably
take it now I've been goin guys
see y'all in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
