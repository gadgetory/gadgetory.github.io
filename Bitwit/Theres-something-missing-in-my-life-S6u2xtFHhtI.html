things what it was a compliment I'm not
doing anything anywhere I'm gonna go I'm
gonna go chill in the dining room here
I'll just I'll just sit down here with
the girl no so this is what it feels
like to be this flow to the ground all
the time
wait furniture this video is brought to
you by mod Mike modular Mike you can fix
to any set of headphones for the best of
both worlds high-quality voice audio
superb noise cancelling and the option
for Wired or wireless models are just a
few reasons I've been using their
products for years mod mic is a great no
compromise solution for gamers who care
about sound click on the link below to
learn more
she's like please free me of this human
her primordial pouch is showing also
known as girl balls
it's just excess skin it's funny after
getting spayed or neutered the girl has
perceptibly large balls and the boy has
none you guys are a little gender
benders we're getting new roller shades
today girl yeah new roller shades don't
destroy him or I'll destroy you wifey
sauce and I are getting furniture today
because we needed to fight badly for
starters we need a dining room table so
we look for one of those now we're gonna
have two dining areas sort of like
casual one that's gonna be a smaller
round table with maybe four chairs
around it that's gonna go in the actual
dining room that's just adjacent to the
kitchen and that's what we're gonna be
shopping for today we actually have a
longer more formal dining table that
wife and sauces grandparents are giving
to us and that's still yet to arrive
we're also going to be looking for some
patio furniture and was the third one oh
maybe a buffet cabinet to keep our nice
plates and wine glasses in that would
also be going in the dining room area
this is all very interesting stuff I
know you're all fascinated oh we also
got brand new blinds no do not Bynes
Mickey conne the blinds because I've
never had anything else like roller
shades we got our new roller shades
installed today professional installers
came in and drilled us some holes and
now we have blinds no gates we have
roller shades
my face awesome Ivy's us dies inside a
little every time I say blind but
they're really nice their electronic
they have motors in them and you can
actually use your phone I think it's
even Amazon Alexa enabled so we'll play
around with it later on today for now on
to our first furniture store it's
actually called Scandinavian design
which makes me think of a fractal design
case because they are known further
Scandinavian designs I hope that we can
find a couch that looks like in define
r6 that pretty cool hold on hold on
there's been there's been an upset we're
not going to a furniture store right now
we're going to a grocery store to get
whyphy sauce food cuz she literally she
literally can't do anything right now
until she gets food in her stomach and
we ate like three hours ago business may
not resume until until wifey sauce gets
for second look you know since we're
here I might as well get something for
myself as well you can't just put food
in front of me and expect me not to eat
it wife he loves your nuts
Oh plantain chips nuts but you did get
nuts I see some almonds there hey
they're playing friends yeah yeah we can
get a copyright strike on this video by
the way I got Caesar salad and tuna
salad my two favorite salads wife he
just got some inferior salad nasty
quinoa in it oh it's quinoa booboo
quinoa healthy quinoa double boo we're
gonna be in the Google Maps yeah but
people recognize our bodies never be
like I'd recognize that sexy tight
little body anywhere that's definitely
Kyle on that blob next to it must be
wifey sauce okay
YV sauce testing out the first couch she
sees this is an outdoor patio set right
it's tested oh yeah it's not bad
ooh how about that table right there see
I like this because it's an actual big
sprawling table you can play board games
on or have a meal outside whoo that's
fun with a little bench see what it's
like you're not in love with it
I'm gonna keep looking let's keep
looking okay outdoor patio table number
two nice but the bench is so picnic II
it's it's it's festive you want
something like this chair with that
table something like this but what
really with this this would go at the
end of the dining table no I'm just
guessing right now that's kind of comfy
maybe I can kind of feel the rails in my
but it's kind of grill in my but I feel
like I'm sitting on a barbecue right now
pretty much all the outdoor furniture
that the store has they do have some
dining tables as well for indoor but I
see anything that tickles your fancy
that's that's a no we might come back
here and pick out one of the outdoor
dining tables if we don't see anything
better for the rest of the day well
let's go into the next door so indoor
dining table it looks very nice and
modern I think we prefer these chairs
because they're very comfortable on the
back whereas these ones this wood bar in
particular really probes your back for
lack of a better term but these are
really nice only question I have is how
much is it I don't like that look this
is comfy we're not buying a couch today
this would be a good one for the office
cuz it pulls out into a bed too yeah
it's definitely nice it looks kinda
officee and it's pretty comfy there's a
price tag I'm up I'm look so this is a
sort of rounded option which is pretty
cool because this middle portion is
modular so you can remove it and make
the table smaller some flexibility there
but we're definitely not a fan of the
color because it's too light just like
our floors we want a bit more contrast
so the first table we actually like a
lot better this is the exact same table
that you just saw but different color
but now that I'm seeing it in this color
the grain just kind of looks a little
busy to me and wipey sauce agrees it
looks kind of all over the place kind of
looks like primo chill view fluid little
shampoo e so yeah we're not a fan of it
so far we still like the first table
best table number one I choose you
furniture I should take a dough ting we
can eat dinners off of the floor now
wait what I think we should get the
buffet the magic the buffet cabinet this
thing you would you would throw that in
it does it does match nicely
do you need a place for all of our nicer
plate where should we do it
yeah they're gonna they're gonna drop it
off on Friday Thursday and install it
for us and set it up and stuff we've
saved the nicest store for last part hey
Tosh a it's where I do all my fine
shopping hair bite RJ so here we're
getting plates bowls cups and cutlery
you want to cheap alternatives of of all
the nice stuff that we have that we got
for our wedding we don't want our clumsy
friends break you all over nice chunk so
these are sort of burners burners if you
will we get eight of everything for just
over a hundred bucks not bad okie dokie
we are home after a long day of running
errands and furniture shopping I told
you guys earlier that I was gonna show
you our brand new roller shades and here
they ah pretty swanky yeah we got black
but they don't look too dark not too
overwhelmingly black since the they do
let some light bleed through so they
look a little bit lighter in person we
did upgrade the option to motorized so
there's actually four motors one for
each of these curtains so there's three
there and there's one on that smaller
window so we actually have a Wi-Fi hub
that we purchased separately from the
same shade store and this actually
supports Amazon Alexa so we can control
our blinds like true lazy Americans with
the sound of our voice which is pretty
cool but in case you live in the Stone
Age still or you're just more
traditional they've also included a
remote I think wifey sauce actually
prefers this cuz she's an old soul yeah
that using the using an analog tape
measure
well yeah born in a bad lady so a quick
little demo with the remote uh-huh and
you can control all of them
simultaneously or one at a time all
right let's give it a shot my voice turn
family room shades off okay we have
shades another news we have this box
that just came in the mail and I have no
idea what's inside although it's it's
fairly large incredibly light and
whatever's in here was not packaged very
well it's just kind of rolling around
loosey-goosey in there it makes me a
little concerned I hope it's not
something fragile I honestly have no
idea
and now that we live where we work this
could be something incredibly boring and
not tech related at all oh it's my
bucket it's a car washing bucket from
the chemical guys because the flooring
guys who did our floors did a great job
they stole our bucket they stole my car
washing bucket and they used it to mix
mint or something and I thought they
would clean it out and give it back to
us but they just stole it so I can wash
my car again now I heard a doorbell ring
who could it be the bun CEO today all
right we're on our way to dinner now
look a guy as soon as I start vlogging
he's like wait switch sides because the
lighting will be better on I've missed
you so much Chris what have you been up
to since you know we moved into the
house Oh work work and more work sounds
great when can the viewers hope to see
maybe more of you maybe in the next
coming month or two I don't know that's
a good question Kyle if only you were
joining us for a global events like
Computex or something come June which
you will be he's gonna be shooting for
us and editing for us in Taipei in a
couple weeks here so very excited to
have him back on the team for now
apparently there's a really long drop
here how can you even see oh my god it
looks like it goes down like oh I can
actually see it what's down there so
whoa that body I think I see a buzz out
of hand that's really creepy maybe
that's why it says this is not a
pedestrian walkway so what's it like
working for ZOTAC
you know how much are they paying you to
hang out with me right now this this
fine it was good seeing Chris again
we're gonna watch some Netflix on our TV
in this room which we've never done
before at night because we're always too
paranoid that people are watching us
through this window and now they can't
these shades were such a great
investment I think we should watch
Netflix in here naked alright I'll take
my clothes off right now all right guys
on that note thanks for watching the
vlog also like subscribe for more stuff
coming at you soon we're gonna get naked
have a good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
