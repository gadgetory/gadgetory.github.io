I tried to find it on thesaurus couldn't
find it and then it just popped into my
head what the word was
the word was triumvirate means three
judges that's like yeah it's it's
actually goes back to them so I said
like Greek I think does it have any
relation to the the dog with three heads
because I was also a great thing no that
was it
try k9 it true yeah try dogger it three
dog owes actually three dog owes three
dollars out goes try dog owes I don't
know this is a quiet buttery very Greek
what here watch I may go away
this doesn't all your buzz hello hello
everyone we're a little early
we're slightly well we were slightly
early and then we talked normally for a
while but now alright so it looks like
we're streaming we're good alright let's
start the show
welcome this is episode 108 of awesome
hardware you're watching side a this is
a show that Paul and I do every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right
here on twitch TV where we streamed the
entire broadcast in its entirety or you
can watch us on YouTube where we split
it up split it up into two halves again
this is side a after we cut on YouTube
we'll be heading over to pulse channel
side B can go ahead and check it out I
put a link in the description below if
you're watching on YouTube of course and
this is a fun show where we like to have
a couple beers on while we talk about
tech news and sometimes things that
aren't tech news related at all
sometimes it's a bit of a variety show
we like we like to switch it up here and
there so great it's a great introduction
I thank you very much Paul antastic cons
it's almost like I've done this 107
other times before but you know it's we
keep we keep it going we we hope that
you are refined too though every time
every time yep so it's just a little bit
better right maybe maybe one day with
steady steady increase yep so yep no
yeah but I'm going to agree with that
animal awkward pauses absolutely so we
are going to go ahead and dive right
into it
because all I actually we be getting
sushi later there's a high chance of
sushi in the future
yeah but but the place closes at 9:00
p.m. they do have that yeah so we got to
make sure we're on point here yeah we
threw things you can roll through this
move from an A to B so important been
sushi
first off let's quickly plug our stories
all right so my story is bit with tech
slash store I'm still selling a bunch of
stuff some things are out of stock okay
remember which ones are but these
glasses the glasses are should be nicer
in stock all right those are 20 ounce
bad boys so same same capacity as pulse
look at that we have the same the same
capacity his might be lit up to four of
them his same Delia this handy drop that
maybe a little dirtier than mine that's
okay hold the same amount a little bit a
little bit just restock the of evolution
shirts those those read those are back
in stock all right and Paul is also
selling certain Paul's Paul's hardware
net yeah he's got a wide selection of
goodies including polo shirts some
thirties you know more glasses is my
glasses just oozing at the top my
glasses Paul's and every glasses come
with beer they come with the beer inside
of them it's not true and we're stuck
we're selling goods we can't just make
false claims about them sorry this is
this is the only way that I get people
to buy things let's put it the most we
lied like fine print but we don't have
fine print so we have to meet you'll say
actually that's false hey want to cover
our butts this is true all right
speaking of covering our butts let's
cover some stuff on the internet like
the things that we talked about into
fund or not to fund a special segment
that we like to do sometimes okay I hate
the show say cheers Cheers
cheers to each other these are the show
in all of you all you guys have to
hopefully your legal drinking age if you
decide to drink with us drink
responsibly drink safe follow it up with
some sushi drink a lot but also drink
responsibly
all right all right so this is define
not too fun I did a bunch of weeding in
my backyard this weekend whoa whoa you
know that's TMI Paul yeah it was grounds
like a periscope I did recently we do is
laborious there's no relation there but
um all right so this just wow this is
jumped up quickly Wow oh yeah morning it
was at 36 K now it's a 41 k sorry a 41
we're looking at crowd crowdfunding
campaigns
those of you who are new to this whole
thing or just checking them out to see
what's what struggling will tell you
which of these you should buy into yep
now this this one does seem like
probably more legit because it is by the
by the makers of Roomba by the Roomba
guy
so the Roomba people have made the
turtle turtle oh yeah they say it is a
solar-powered weeding robot for your
garden which I recently having spent so
much time gardening my garden and hating
how many weeds and stuff are there I'm
somewhat interested in so now at first I
was like that is it like yank stuff up
or whatever no that's basically like
well weed whacker yeah it's a little
mini weed whacker that goes a nylon wire
underneath that spins anytime it detects
a little shrub that's less than an inch
tall yeah so it just goes over it chops
it down and the theory here is if you
run it everyday you don't actually need
to pull the weed completely out by the
root because it'll just it'll just sweep
it regularly and it'll just keep
chopping it down and it'll detect you
know if it's if it's a plant that's
longer than or taller than an inch it'll
just go buy it you can also put little
guards around plants that you want to
protect so that it knows not to chop
them chop them up I'd love to see
someone pull a prank with this like put
it in their neighbor's backyard who like
likes to grow like actual weed like
marijuana and just have it take out and
destroy their entire weed garden that
mean we're gonna be the very small
plants you'd have to get them early on
yeah you'd have to get them you know
before they start button obviously but
it looks like it's got some pretty
heavy-duty wheels too you know kind of
trek across the soil alright powered at
solar-powered right so it would probably
lose to a Roomba in a fight if it was
indoors you've got these little metal
brackets that you put around your plants
because if you're growing small plants
they need time to grow before they're
large enough for the turtle to recognize
them as larger plants now the thing that
I immediately realized is like okay it's
it's judging whether or not to kill the
plant based on how big the plant is so
this would not solve my problem of like
already having two-foot tall weeds in my
backyard right which which you know
there's a lot less of them now but
they're still
significant amount this would definitely
preempt that a bit so yeah you gotta you
gotta already have liked it relatively
well-tended garden and then this will go
around and and and whack off the just
the tiny it whack ops a tiny buds
beautifully said beautifully said should
market for these gentlemen simple design
there you know any weed whacker does its
like this do you ever have to replace
the the nylon thing there I imagine
maybe my weed whacker that's what I have
to do constantly place the damn nylon
thing right winder a twine that thing
around in there I'm sure it lasts of why
it's probably easy to replace yeah so
super early birds could have gotten it
for 200 bucks right now to get in there
are still less than 50 left for the $225
not quite as early bird option here so
225 bucks right now estimated delivery
May of 2018
only shipping to certain countries you
also get a package of the plant colors
super useful after those are gone it's
going to jump up to 250 which seems like
that'll be a CY there's already people
there's already three backers who are
just like no I don't want to give me
extra money 225 I'll give you just I'm
just gonna go straight for the full
price and memorator anyway I think that
the types would be useful but look yeah
let's hold on I know Joe even Christmas
Paul let's see what other potential
beauties here are Ike's on to fund or
not to buy next up we've got the Arsenal
this is the intelligent camera assistant
that's already been funded 1.3 million
dollars out of $50,000 50 grand I
obviously this caught my eye for that
reason alone and I was like okay I have
to see what's going on here and this is
this is more so geared towards the gear
head if you will who's into photography
and and camera work and things like that
Dmitri was the first to come to mind
however it uses a I to take the perfect
shot so if you're a professional or avid
photographer you know that anytime
you're about to take a shot of any sort
of environment you have to sort of
tailor the the different settings right
you have to change your ISO you got to
adjust your your
sure your shutter speed all these things
need to be sort of the right balance for
the particular environment you're
shooting in so this is just a sensor
that actually has 18 different
environmental questions so to speak that
it that it will ask and go visit sir
it'll it'll just not even presets it'll
actually just run down a list are you
are you outside of 18 different
environmental factors it'll analyze
where you are what you're looking at and
then from there it'll automatically
dynamically adjust all those various
cameras is there a large aluminum
structure 90 degrees to your right um
what would that have any news it might
be reflecting you know oh right yeah
things like these are they ours i
someone in a coma okay it's zero it's no
big : right is there any megapixels
tripod vibration somebody pick slacking
off and execute image stabilization so
it basically takes the perfect shot and
they go up nice little before-and-after
here okay um so that's kind of cool it
also does stacking you can do photo
stacking so it can actually take let's
say multiple images of the same scene at
different exposures and then overlap
those photos to basically give you a
high dynamic range image that makes
sense
it was detecting wind shake there was
detecting wind show it was it was very
smart decreasing the shutter speed it's
very observant yes exactly so it's just
it's very reactive based on what you're
shooting so this is an example of some
stacking three photos of different
exposures to get sort of a nice high
dynamic HDR effect this basically
replaces photographers so yes it's as if
you're a lazy
we don't need photographers and your
lazy ass photographer and just put this
thing and have a nice camera right by
your way to taking amazing photo this is
how Skynet starts so let's see it can't
it can't frame the photo for you though
it can't it that's the patch update see
you buy that you buy the tripod head
attachment and it'll just exactly know
how to frame it'll do rule of thirds or
rule of fifths or whatever the hell you
want it'll just boom it'll be a better
photographer than anyone it can't tell
you what to point the camera at though
Dmitry's not any trees in trouble guys I
look at a lot of time lapses um so 150
for the early bird 175 if you're not so
early
that's a lot to pay to be a lazy
photographer yeah yeah I mean that's
wait how much would I think 150 to 175 I
mean if you're a what's the camera
compatibility you need um Sony Nikon
Canon and isn't any of the Fuji all the
big ones all me then what else has a USB
connector I ever imagined right yeah
alright let's that sounds like a point
three million dollars clearly people
want it Ansel Adams is rolling in his
grave yep alright for Anne's 11 talked
about the pilot a smart earpiece
language translate it's a Babel Fish to
Babel Fish yes that's the moment that's
when we put in the notes real-life Babel
Fish is four point four million dollars
Wow well this is us the Arsenal was was
hotcakes
well this were plates Trant replaces
translators it's like almost all of the
stuff we're talking about I guess though
everything replaces stuff right like the
turtle thing places gardeners yeah the
Arsenal Asus photographers photographers
and now we're replacing the need for
translators yep yeh yeh technology jobs
alright so Turner bucks for the pilot is
all that's available for this right and
sorry you can you can either pending I
plan I think that's actually sold out or
no longer available you can pre-order it
for 250 now oh you just have to go
directly it's gone up we we made too
much money at IndieGoGo yeah they
probably have a cut-off like you have to
 you so I'm this guy this guy in the
right he's the owner the founder would
ever end apparently he said he got the
idea for making this not from
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy no way
I think is total but he said
that he he got the idea after meeting a
French girl while he was travelling
abroad and you know not being able to
communicate with her because she spoke
very little English which I don't know
if this is the French girl but it looks
like okay it looks like they're platonic
friends so even though he can now
understand her it doesn't
any better at getting women that's
clearly what's going on here I guess it
works very similarly to Google Translate
if you've ever used that because there
is a voice feature there yeah we were
kind of using it a bit in Taiwan it was
sort of spotty so I think that's really
what's going to make or break this sort
of technology is how accurate the
translation is because if it's just sort
of jumbled or still like you know half
broken sentences its dog that might need
us odd noises so I think it is
should I go do the thing or no um oh no
it's my house okay you do it ladies and
gentlemen it appears that we have an
unexpected visitor or an unexpected
delivery perhaps all right Paul's Paul's
going to the door he's opening the door
I can see I can't see him but I can see
that there's now more more light coming
into the house indicating that the door
has been opened
it looks like the doors been closed but
I no longer hear Paul looks like Paul is
now outside of the house I think Paul is
dead I think that's what what's what's
just happened whoever came here has just
murdered Paul Oh God there was ever a
time to get swatted I hope like that
would work out perfectly right if we got
swatted right now like it would be like
oh thank god you're here my friend just
got murdered oh no it's a it's a pizza
it's just a pizza I thought you were
dead
I'm so glad you're alive with pizza with
pizza no less all right oh Jesus
no he's okay everyone no no no more rips
Paul is alive he's alive and well with
pizza is this pizza from from from from
Brian
Brian Brian you son of a gun you
sumbitch thank you Brian
Murr exit in chat if you're watching
which I'm sure you are thank you very
much for delivering us a pizza which I
see Paul's getting some plates out he's
getting stuff out sorry sorry for the
headphone users in chat we apologize
it's not from Linus Winans would never
send us a pizza he'd send us a pipe bomb
all right sweet what kind of pizzas it
ooh it's a meaty one he knows we like
our meat hell yeah
now my favorite paper
RGV Python to be quick to be corrected
to be sure ah yeah um well jeez guys I
guess what's everyone's what's your
guys's favorite pizza what is your
favorite pizza in the world
I don't care what it is it can be peanut
M&amp;amp;Ms peanut M&amp;amp;M pizza I'd still love you
I think you're really weird never hang
out with you but oh my goodness you know
oh here oh oh my goodness Julie no here
oh no you're so gross such a gross dog
Jack he wants to be loved and loved with
love blue paint
did I say pepperoni and sausage I meant
vegetarian this is it all of it this is
all video it's only veggies that's why I
can't eat it there's nobody anymore
lately tional thank you oh you have yeah
was it because you started to realize
just you had no strength you know no had
nothing to do with that you were do I
literally felt no no better or worse
felt weak all the time I felt no better
or worse really any my shits were a lot
easier that's back then but at some
point I was just like I really miss
eating this cow yeah you know I love it
out all right so let's not get too
distracted here but Brian thank you so
much better than even that was of course
you Brian you're very kind
YUM
they talk about this oh yeah so watch
these should be fun um I'll be honest I
know you you're gonna pick the weed
whacker yeah but I mean the the smart
earpiece language translator I mean I
have to see I have to see it reviewed I
have to see someone use it but that just
seems so incredibly useful for travel
and anything like that throw I mean
especially depending on how many
languages it can but pick up and
translate well I have stuff wouldn't the
other person that you're the foreigner
that you're interacting with also need
one for you would have to like give them
one yeah this wouldn't that be weird
like here gives you like a magician but
you don't know who the they are you
don't even know you can't even you never
even said akka curat word to them before
and now they're like stick to still here
so and all it needs a partner product
that's like a little you talk into it
and then it right
hello this is a new technology just like
a version that's a speaker that just
speaks it out loud for you or something
I am NOT crazy
yeah put this in your ear please okay
that's what it should say should be able
to say that that's the first thing it
should say yeah and then and it's in all
over in all languages sometimes yes the
same time just rolls through okay okay
um yeah I agree with you that would be a
pretty cool thing if it worked well um
but let's let's move on shall we because
we've got some other things to talk
about here including hot and heavy
hardware whoa hmm it's hardware that's
hot and heavy that's why it's cold out
in here
all right the first thing on the agenda
here is a fun little product or a series
of products from Logitech they've
developed a wireless charging mousepad
that is pretty genius this is this
article comes from ARS technica thank
you guys there
now wireless charging from the get-go
wasn't there another company that had
something similar to this every now
that's allowed to talk about that yet
Asus I I didn't name the company because
if we're not supposed to talk about it I
didn't want to say what the name of the
company was well I was talking about
something they had at CES so it's that
now I'm talking about something Computex
uh I wouldn't know much about that Paul
okay yep let's move on then alright so
what does this do Kyle it's a wireless
mouse mouse mouse pads it charges your
be out mousepad while you're gaining
steal never that's nothing like the
thing is I detect nope not at all okay
but maybe I don't know maybe cuz I
didn't see that thing that you're
talking about Computex I didn't see it
but I feel like this article wouldn't
have been written like with such like oh
my gosh this is so cool if that had been
well like I said I'm not positive I'm
not positive if it if it was something
that they were just showing you press ah
okay that wasn't being talked about
publicly yet did they put like that but
I remember I remember because I actually
didn't go and see it I was told about
but I didn't go and see it I think I
know yeah okay but like I said okay
anyway point being being hey look what
logitech did yay um okay so anyway this
is cool because wireless charging in the
past was kind of pointless like you
still had to have your device or
whatever on a pad this works because the
mouse is always going to be on the pad
like you don't ever have to remove the
mouse and very rare instances where you
never have to like take it off the pads
which means it's always going to be
charging while you're using it
that's pretty pretty sweet the bundle
the powerplay bundles 100 bucks it
includes a wireless charging base to
switchable surfaces so you get hot hot
hard or soft surfaces that's kind of
mousing and a power core module that's
what they're calling it a power core
which is the small little puck that is
inserted into a compatible power play
system power play Mouse so that's a
little puck looks like it goes sort of
where the the weight tray what we
initially originally go and that's how
it sort of gets its power it's not a Qi
charger it's not a Qi charger not the Qi
charger which is actually pronounced Qi
for some reason it's not a Qi charger
but it's a proprietary in-house
technology made by Logitech that's based
on magnetic resonance wireless power
transfer and that basically the way that
works is the power core the little puck
that's in there I don't know why that
pictures there the little puck that go
to the mouse I said it looks like the
Batmobile oh okay yeah maybe that's true
so the power core puck that goes into
the mouse has a small antenna that
communicates with another antenna or
maybe several antennas that are in the
mat when power flows through one coil
which which it's it's going to then the
other resonates and that can be that
power can be turned into electricity
it's all very scientific
Batmobile launched there's going to be
two supported mice the g9o two Batmobile
which is a modified g9o 900 Batmobile
and the G 703 I don't know g7 no the
reals
yeah oh yeah they pull up the picture as
I'm talking about sorry sorry they're
the one with the both of them white and
the black one
the day 703 is the white one I believe
similar to the g4o 403 those are both
available later this month the mouse can
charge anywhere on the mat so it doesn't
need to be like centered or off to one
side or the other which would really
suck if that were the case now that
would be lame and the the whole bundle
will be available on August 20th and the
aforementioned mice again will be ready
later this June so I feel like this is
probably gonna take off the only thing
this is missing is RGB I mean the little
little G logo on the little power
adapter there is RGB but we need more
RGB the mouse isn't you know uh I think
the mouse might be doesn't say whether
it is or not so I don't know I would
imagine it is but I'm talking about the
mouse pad itself they got to step it up
to like raise your koala needs to have
like the Firefly RGB and a trim trimmer
on the outside yeah
that's it's kind of every it's
definitely the first thing that I think
about yeah I mean come on because you
know some people out there they're like
well this is really cool but I'm still
gonna buy the Firefly because it looks
pretty I'm sorry just that's just where
we are now it's what this has come to so
keep an eye out for that maybe we'll
take a look at it that's overcome one of
the two main problems with wireless
mouse been dying one is the mouse being
charged two is the mouse's connectivity
with the wireless receiver wherever that
happens to be which in most cases is not
an issue at this point but in situations
where there's lots of interference can
be mm-hmm that's true um moving on
Samsung you guys are probably seen this
already a thousand times look at this
she had were ultrawide monitor they've
tried over thousand times
maybe maybe like five hundred look how
wide that what did they just have what
is this excel this is Excel it probably
goes all the way to Z yeah um
now this is a 49 inches Jesus for nine
inches 32 by 9 aspect ratio so 16 by 9
side-by-side yep - 16 by 9 side-by-side
and actually
to 1920 by 1080 side-by-side because
it's a 38 40 by 1080 this is a
resolution cue LED quantum dot
supporting HDR 10 standard and it
features a AMD freesync to cool free
seat to latest free sync available one
millisecond response time 144 Hertz
refresh rate so not only would this be a
good monitor for ultra productivity as
you see in the Excel spreadsheet there
but also you can do some serious gaming
especially if you have let's say you
know an upcoming Vega GPU to push that
144 Hertz refresh rate I'm sure that
would be a pretty fun panel to game on
could you imagine gaining on that though
I mean they're pretty crazy I mean like
the 21 by nine already encompasses what
I feel like is most of my peripheral
vision yeah this would just absolutely
dominate it and I almost I almost feel
like the wider though the wider the
monitor like the the more trapped I feel
vertically yeah I miss vertical pixels
yeah I feel like I can't it's definitely
a very very very wide trash compactor it
I mean you see people who do the triple
monitor setups and this seems like a bit
more viable than that because you do not
dealing with the bezels and it's like
you know having to 16 by 9 1080 1080
monitors for a while with would be an
awesome gaming setup if it wasn't for
the fact that the bezels were dead
center yes oh yeah anything on pricing
50 or a 1,500 bucks 1,500 freaking bucks
oh yeah that's pretty
honestly I would expect around that
price that's for the 49 inch mm-hmm but
there's also a 1/32 inch for $6.99 and a
27 inch for a little bit less 27 what
like 27 inches that's also the same
aspect ratio I didn't it didn't mention
the article is just part of the see like
that would be like 4 inches to like 4
inches tall and yeah with that aspect
ratio with a 30
by nine aspect ratio that would be a
very security support monitor but I
don't know if this is really practical I
mean gaming yes it's gonna kick ass I
would imagine practicality I think it
depends on what you're doing what kind
of multitasking you're really looking at
I feel like ever since using my predator
x34 as my daily driver I feel like I
much rather prefer to monitor side by
side just for the snapping ability you
have more areas to see you have more
sides and edges of the screens - snap -
snapping it's nice and just I love
snapping for that's just me though like
if I'm streaming it's nice to just be
able to like partition things on two
monitors than it is on one I guess but
again it depends on if you're if you're
using Excel you need if you really need
like this is that zag actually a really
good example of why you need to keep
ultra wide if you really needed a full
comprehensive look at like a long Excel
spreadsheet or something like that you
wouldn't want to drag that across two
monitors and have a bezel in the middle
or something like that you know I mean
so it just depends on what you're doing
again 1500 bucks is a pretty penny I'm
sure that there's a very niche market
who's going to be into that moving on
though we've got a crazy see sonic
titanium power supply this was shown at
Computex this year I did not get a
chance to stop by see sonic fanless um
it's completely fanless this is an
article from an ad tech thank you very
much Anton this is a featuring two new
additions to see Sonic's existing prime
titanium family which they announced
earlier this year
these are showcased again at the recent
Computex
this is including a 600 watt unit and a
thousand watt unit you'll see thousand
want units too much anymore because
graphics Kubik graphics cards are just
becoming much more power efficient but
the 600 watt seems interesting it's 80 +
titanium as are all the units in this
lineup is a 600 watt the only one that's
fanless are they all famous
I think love the thousand well fan was -
um but connectivity I'm sorry it
complies with ATX 12 volt um
viii 2.4 as well as EPS specifications
12-year warranty
oh that's a long long warranty I thought
when they went up to ten I was like wow
that's as long as the warranty is going
to get now it's up to 12 you know he's
getting longer Paul you know he's
aggressive
so fanless fully modular flat black
cables the connectivity for the 600 watt
anyway which is model number SSR 600 TL
includes two six plus two pin PCIe power
connectors for the graphics cards of
course six SATA power plugs five molex
headers and one floppy connector that
have that floppy price though go hold
your breath up to $300 u.s. mmm we might
be seeing for the 600 watt model and
they give us a range in Euros 224 to 275
275 being the high end is $300 u.s. so
at the most this will cost 300 maybe
it'll cost 250 at the low end but it's a
very hefty price premium for all the all
the things you're getting here 80 plus
titanium certification 12 year warranty
again though if you are guaranteed that
this thing's going to last you 12 years
maybe maybe but still I would imagine
other less expensive units are going to
last you that long hold on though these
are listed separately so I think that
600 watt unit is only one that's fanless
oh really yeah is right here they have
the C Sonic prime fanless titanium 600
watt that's listed here but some then
they also have the C Sonic prime
titanium series okay which seems to have
a different model number gotcha
or maybe I don't know I just I could see
the six not being the only one that's
fanless does it have a DB rating and
that in that chart up here oh no it
doesn't remind no just wattage and rails
okay um but anyway well they have this
power supply and this power supply which
means I think it has some beefier heat
sinks on some of the more via the hotter
components just to make sure it doesn't
overheat probably um things like that
but uh yeah if you're in the market for
a high end power supply I feel like 600
watts is pretty pretty good yeah I mean
I wanted to go them it's a good amount
for pretty much any standard single GPU
gaming yeah system and a little bit
extra on top yeah this is true all right
let's move on to the last last piece of
hardware here for today's hot and heavy
hardware which is the Xbox 1x I know
you're all thrilled to hear about this
yep but I thought I'd just mention it
really quickly simply because it's all
the buzz all the hype right now this was
initially project Scorpio that we've
been hearing about for quite some time
it was just announced two days ago
the official name is Xbox 1x which i
think is a stupid name first off um and
it's basically the next console
launching from Microsoft on November 7th
for 500 bucks 500 bucks so ok
undo it be you know and I kind of like
it when these consoles come out now
because it gives us like PC gamers more
PC centric users an opportunity to try
to like beat it out at the same price
you know what I mean try to build like
another top seller you got to beat it
out you got a bet you got to build a
console killer now that's going to beat
out this the level of quality that the
Xbox one X can pump out you know the
same price
so all existing Xbox one accessories are
going to work with this thing
Microsoft's Microsoft is supposedly
going to use super sampling on the new
console to make games look sharper even
on 1080p displays so I would imagine
that something similar to nvidia x'
dynamic super resolution perhaps I don't
know if it's if it's anything like that
but it sounds like it's super Sam close
your exam please
yeah okay then then I'm correct and then
I knew that yeah the pizza thing so it's
going to ship with six teraflops of
graphical horsepower more than the ps4
pro mind you with only 4.2 teraflops
lame using custom GPU running at eleven
hundred and seventy two megahertz I
don't really have any more information
on that GPU it's using a liquid cooled
vapor chamber design inside of what's
what they're calling the smallest Xbox
ever it is tiny pretty darn small
leaning against the Xbox one controller
there you can probably throw that into a
backpack I think that's pretty small
yeah so that's good on them for that
ships with an Ultra HD blu-ray drive for
4k content that's the only reason that I
got the Xbox one a store like the anime
reason yeah
you're watching planet Earth two on that
recent that's actually really cool I bet
one terabyte of hard drive storage a
surprise there's no like SSD storage yet
I guess they're trying to keep the price
down there's going to be 22 console
launch exclusive and exclusive titles
including crackdown 3 sea of thieves and
Forza Motorsport 7 which will run at
native 4k 60fps
okay but but I mean technically anything
can run in 4k 60th well I shouldn't say
anything but many games could probably
run at 4k 60fps if you just crank down a
lot of the quality settings so it's a
matter of you know resolution verse
versus other other filters that might be
you know adding to the quality of the
overall experience
maybe there's maybe it's 4k but you know
there's there's no there's no shadows
it's like zero shadows or tessellation
no desolation everything's just flat it
looks like Super Mario 64 so clean oh no
anti-aliasing either that's what I mean
in 4k though technically you don't even
need a just you know everyone knows that
Pokemon stupid okay that's enough talk
on the Xbox one x4 now let's move on to
something a little bit more interesting
face off Paul and I go head-to-head in a
shitty online two-player game and the
stakes are high this time the punishment
since I couldn't think of anything else
more creative is death so one of us
isn't making making it making and making
it out alive after this this round so
you ready are you ready to should I hope
I win otherwise I want to have however
really be able to do you'll have to do
my half of the show no no that sucks I
hope well then my diner better hope you
die I'm hoping all right
I can't wait to die give your your keys
yeah
bottle opener I always have a bottle up
in there I'm getting ready to die never
know when you're gonna need a there ever
another train is ever gonna die okay
alright
so what yeah you have another beer okay
yeah just making sure I'm working on it
I'm working on it so the game we're
playing today actually um you probably
need that that keyboard dudes
oh yes ah yes you're already not
prepared for the face-off that's okay
this is called foosball game you know
you're lucky that we're not just playing
foosball that we're playing foosball
game that we're playing a online game
that's imitating foods ball cuz for
you're just playing foosball you kick my
ass I probably beat you like physically
no not that I mean well I mean yes
physically in a certain sense but not
like with your fists like you know I
mean I probably win like the man I'm
pretty I'm pretty good at foosball Oh
someone say I'm pretty bad at foosball
well so maybe I would surprise you with
how else having not played foosball in
like quite a few years but I used to be
pretty damn good at it so who knows but
well more to the point we'll see if that
translates to a digital environment it
it might you never know
alright so we're going to do two player
this is a very complex very complex game
here I don't know if we'll be able to
even like fathom or get a hold of all
the controls scroll down should I
all right is it playing already know
scroll down okay yeah probably rolls out
whatever okay so our one i'm W&amp;amp;S and
you're up and down so it's gonna be it's
gonna be tough you know we're we're
clearly not we're clearly in over our
heads
I am player one so I don't think we're
playing yet unless did you plug this in
to player might have already been doing
I'm not sure do player two player okay
oh and I'm the blue X happen
automatically the kicks happen
automatically looks like I just scored
oh no I'm red what I'm red and I usually
score oh wow
I'm at amazing by the way it's right
there is a score there is score on
either side right geez yeah alright this
is really kicking your ass we're off you
can only control all of them together
because Oh Julia there we go
good lord it is two two two now you'll
never get it you'll never get away with
this oh I just oh and by the way Oh boss
is bad oh my god I'm so good it's not
even fair oh oh oh you got glimmer a
funcle' give you that glimmer of hope no
let's go move the ball down the field oh
you pansy No Oh aim
Oh some David Beckham right there
oh Jesus I was just deep shine that's
the translation right after the ball
rolled in on the transition foods cheap
as hell and cheap so strategy so cheap
like that Oh like that
Oh hottest of it okay oh Jesus is this
game oh good I'm so good
oh just believe Kyle please shots on
goal you had there in a row oh damn it
yes yeah I win you die that's all yeah
it's not best-of-three earnings all
right well the best-of-three sure we got
time we got time we're still going on
time okay all right here we go I got it
I got a stage you come back here all
right
we're gonna have to see what you're made
out first do anything a second chin
there we go oh yeah you know got to give
you one gotta toss you a bone every once
in a while I blocked that that was

sorry man just this game is poorly coded
your golden days are over
that's ridiculous you hit your peak at
15 a game of foosball there we go yet
tied it up okay put it in my bud now oh
now it's the time when champions are
made
whoa horn fires of Mordor think of
something besides Oh God oh my god
Kenneth Oh good looking layups gonna
limp gonna win now going home it feels
boho look then look at that block right
there what no yes
that was nuts Jesus all right
my quads are getting so ripped right now
oh come on trying to play the transition
right there but don't feel the burn this
is terrible terrible we got forgot this
is match point right now things are not
looking good for me what I'm trying to
say oh oh man this is this is hard to
watch ladies and gentlemen freshest
hitting hard to watch oh that's
frustrating knowing that I if we were
actually playing foosball that I would
be better much better all right you wins
the wrong platform okay
Iowans tune - no sorry and stop yelling
get really excited and I yell sometime
cows Cipriano any time face off happens
just crank the volume old weed
um so Paul's dead then carry on I
literally have no other punishment than
pauldine so Paul do you promise everyone
that after we stream this episode of
Awesome hardware that you will die
what say yes well after the sushi after
sushi after sushi yes I didn't want to
miss that
thank you at least you'll die happy
thank you for allowing me spare my life
until then pull this guy off at least
have a final meal or whatever night that
I pull guys off regularly okay alright
time for news news there's only um two
or three stories here because we're
trying to keep things quick for TV but
um the first thing I want to talk about
take this thread Ripper
19:50 X for months has been leaked out
this is an article from none other than
WCC F Tech so watch out take everything
that I say here with a grain of salt
because I'll be lies and the whole lies
of subterfuge yep it's a big reason so
the rise in thread referred 1950 X was
tested in week bench this is the 16 core
32 thread monster with a base clock of
3.4 gigahertz I believe it was running
its stock there was no mention of it
running overclocked in these tests it
features 32 megabytes of l3 plus eight
megabytes of l2 that's 40 megabytes in
total in case you can't add and the chip
was tested on asrock X 399 professional
gaming motherboard which was featured at
Computex so in the Geekbench
single-threaded tests it scored 40 167
points while scoring twenty four
thousand five hundred and thirty nine
points in multi-threaded applications or
in the mote that tried to test which is
pre pre damn good it's pretty solid
actually WCC F Tech went went on to
compare these results to an Intel Xeon
e5 26 97 a which has the same core and
thread count with a turbo frequency that
matches the base clock of the 1950 X fed
repperton and what they found was single
threaded performance scored 3651 points
which is slightly lower than thread
Ripper and thirty thousand four hundred
and fifty points on the multi-threaded
test which is higher than
Red River so what what we're seeing here
is sort of like there it's trading blows
based on whether we're talking a single
core or multi core performing
interesting I wouldn't have I wouldn't
have called thread Ripper to score
higher on the single core yes we're on
the multi core that's kind of surprising
again all speculation and stuff but I
mean but yeah again of course assuming
this is actual again it's a Xeon to so
this would it's a Xeon but I mean it's
this is a recent Xeon right it's a broad
well easy on ya and rise in instructions
four o'clock performance has been
roughly on par with broad well II this
is a pretty decent jump over that four
down 67 verses 36 51 right but also
might speak to you know the the does it
say the memory that is running at
because the Infinity fabric is what ties
all the CCX UNIX oh yeah 16 gigs at a
thousand 65 right there that's on me
that's all right here that's really low
so if the memory is actually running at
this speed then again that would seem
weird but weirder yeah I don't know
infinity fabric is what ties the CCX
cores together and then who knows I'm
just speculating at this point to
infinity and beyond this all might be
nonsense anyway but one interesting I
guess what's what's also sort of
exciting is at the Xeon core that we're
talking about here Realty retails for
around $3,000
oh and we're I would imagine oh I think
we're all it's safe to say we're all
expecting that this 1950 ex-stripper
chip is going to be significantly less
than that yes so if you can get assuming
that these numbers are true you can get
you know better single core performance
than $3,000 Xeon for significantly less
money I'd say that's a pretty good
bargain and Plus even if it's not
getting quite the same performance on
the multi-threaded scale you're still
getting 16 freaking cores and 32 threads
yeah which is awesome whether you're
doing gaining or
just productivity stuff so TLDR the Red
River continues to look promising and
until should be scared cool
what wetting the bed next up we've got
an Intel another Intel announcement here
from e3 this happened the day or two ago
at the PC gaming show kind of a surprise
actually it wasn't expecting Intel to
announce much juicy news but they they
announced the dates of which they were
going to be releasing and you know
pre-ordering their skylake X and KB like
X processors
no one's on of no one here's some of the
skylake X yes of course it all varies in
the mileage varies here but the dates
that we're seeing are four six eight and
ten core parts so four through ten core
parts are available for pre-order from
June 19th which is like in a week or so
and then you've also got those same
those same parts shipping to consumers
on June 26th starting out and then
twelve core parts are expected just the
12th course q is expected to ship in
August which is just it's just a one-off
it's the only just that one SKU only the
twelve course q is going to be in August
and then the other high core count
processors 14 16 and 18 core parts are
going to be shipping in October that's
that's what we know right now file this
under stuff that should have been told
to reviewers three weeks ago yes because
Paul and I still don't have processors
to review and it's good that would be
useful and decides that they didn't
announce the set also I mean just when
the the initial the initial information
that was provided to reviewers which was
provided about a week for Computex
actually started presented all of this
in one package there was no discussion
at that time of by the way half of these
CPUs that we're telling you about now
are like super paper launch and not
coming for months still right but
obviously they were trying to
you know hmm throw some distraction out
there from from the stuff that AMD was
talking about but also giving given the
estimated launches of these we might
have thread Ripper stuff coming well
before this is out so you might have in
you might have aimed the actually
pre-empting intel on some stuff but yeah
more on that on my half of the show
indeed um and then I don't want to talk
about anything else about that we'll
just move on to the next story okay the
last one because we still have much
donations to go through um PCIe PCI
Express Gen 4 specifications have been
recently unveiled this is an article
from Engadget some PCI s IG I'm just
going to call them pci-sig is the
organization or the community that's
responsible for maintaining peripheral
IO standards and specifications and they
finally release the specs for PCIe gen
oh this is going to give pcs twice the
throughput speed up to 16 Giga transfers
per second as previous 3.0 connections
with backwards compatibility so very
much like we have can we can we come
here real quickly just say that this is
a shitty Leeuwarden shuttle
the article here as we even gadget I
mean happy words that have fun no yeah I
may provide some critique to Engadget
here yeah it's very good on you
reporting on PCIe 4.0 I mean it's it's a
little bit more of a you know techy I
think kind of thing and gadget and I
make way out of your league and gadget
twice as fast though come on guys it's
it's super upgrading to 4.0 is not gonna
make your graphics card any faster cuz
PCIe gen3 was now we have twice the
frame rates that we had on PCIe gen 2
right
it will provide how that works it will
provide more bandwidth it's not it's a
it's a wider data path it is not twice
as fast like a girthier penis right but
it doesn't necessarily screw any faster
that sheets of radish stuff and now a
perfect metaphor seeing now they'll
learn to make now the lawyer with that
metaphor I speak in their language now
all right so um you you have more
Headroom you have more bandwidth you
have more room to pump data through
doesn't necessarily mean that data is
going to be moving twice as fast you're
not pumping it twice as fast a than the
full circle
all right the analogy worked but you you
have more potential I should say to move
faster thank you very much for those
faces in chat those kreygasm shoutouts
people and Chad have noticed that I have
not fallen asleep an episode drink every
time Paul's not asleep all right so uh
PCIe gen for that said still has to
undergo a final IP review before we
start seeing video cards sporting the
new spec it's going to come first the
graphics cards or the motherboards it's
that's always the question
it's weird because to high-end desktop
platforms are launching like right now
yeah
thread ripper ends and the intel stuff
the core x neither those have have PCIe
Gen 4 right and you know what's weird is
the articles also saying that PCI agent
5 might be coming as early as 2019 it's
also seems soon that seems soon that
means what PCI Gen 4 is going to be
around for a year just one generation
it's going to go or maybe there is some
overlap they're generally pretty good
with backwards compatibility when it
comes to p3 Express so just seems like
it's all coming at once yeah she said
just everywhere but yeah there was also
like PCIe gen 2 to Gen 3 for example
there were the awkward situations like
with x79 where x79 was Gen 2 when it
first launched but then there were ways
you could force gen 3 because there was
like complot it was like the controller
was capable of it but it wasn't like
validated so they were weird
there was like some weird stuff you
could do to force gen3 mode and that
kind of thing so I don't know I don't
know if there will be anything to that
effect when it comes to like the x2 99
or x3 99 motherboard sort of launching
right now but given that we're looking
at within the next year this is supposed
to be available I don't know I don't
know I don't know these things no one
knows I just like throwing out
hypotheticals but we were looking up
some random specs earlier on what PCIe
gen3 is currently offering in terms of
bandwidth and I feel like we're already
starting to max that out with really
fast like nvme about two drives yeah so
PCI gen 4 if it's not going to if it's
not going to be saturated by the
graphics cards anytime soon the very
least we might see some gains within the
storage department you know or some more
headroom there yeah the the 960 Pro and
that 2 SSD for example from Samsung can
hit 3.5 3.6 gigabytes per second actual
you know direct sequential rewrites I'm
sorry reads he writes a little bit
slower and that's getting pretty close
to PCIe gen3 a 4 a by 4 connection for
PCI gen3 is about 4 gigabytes per second
yeah of actual throughput indeed so so
yeah
it seems like as we are also on the cusp
of having faster SSDs when we see like
hopefully obtain technology and more
devices and that kind of thing can
actually make use of PC a Gen 4 so yeah
cool all right
so to sort of wrap things up here let's
quickly go over some of the donations
that you guys threw out for the record
we forgot to mention this at the
beginning but since we're sort of
pressed for time tonight we're only
going to be calling out donations five
dollars or more just from taking a quick
gander at the existing donations it only
looks like one person donated less than
less than that so we'll just read
readers out to it
oh we have classy viewers yes we do LLL
have IU's thank you for your donation
thank you have a no comment attached
Clint flipo for the $20 donation
the board has to buy sixteen physical
and electrically wired PCIe slots the
manual recommends the top one but
doesn't matter it looks so much better
and the tubes from the hybrid cooler
aren't so bent doesn't matter clay
doesn't matter go for that lower slot
yep do whatever you do put put your
thing in whatever slot you want yep
don't tell my father that though your
second slot will probably run it by
eight when you put the card there but
you're still totally fine with that
yep Hayden Haslam for the five bucks wha
would you guys recommend I upgrade my
graphics card from a GT I'm sorry EVGA
gtx 1060 for the win to something better
I have a saber-tooth x99 with a 1600 K
and 1440p monitor yeah yeah I think so i
from the basic specs that you that
you're listening here I'd say your GPU
is your bottleneck yeah if you're going
to be gaming at 1440p then you
definitely need a faster car to sort of
suit the really fast processor that
you've gotten there and the higher
resolution as well on your display look
look into like time Deveny look I'm
doing this yeah I can try to find a
bargain 1070 or or you know keep an eye
out for the next hopefully month or so
and there might be Vega cards dropping
and you might see we have no idea what
the product stack for that's going to
look like but hopefully there's going to
be something that competes with a 1070
and there we got assume and yeah that'd
be got that nice upgrade from you for
the graphics card side yes indeed lucky
dog 24 thanks for the five bucks if I
turn off my PC it won't turn back on
only posts after trying like 50 times
guess I'll leave it running until I
build a new PC mmm host issues or boot
issues are a pain in the ass but it huh
so it likes a warm boot it doesn't like
a cold boot
it's hard to say without more
information I'm not sure if you're
overclocking or anything like that try
resetting all the settings and your BIOS
restore to defaults and getting to your
BIOS if possible and restore everything
back to normal
see if that helps at all by a BIOS
update could also be yes such as it
solves a problem like if I update or
BIOS update and then just double check
every single connection sort of sort of
what I like to do any times is a V build
that's the system in my head just like
you know just like I follow all the all
the wires make sure suddenly you know it
works it's good troubleshooting thing
some suggestions from chats a a lot of
people pointing to the power supply so
that's a often a good a good potential
issue for something like that if you
have a low-quality one check your CMOS
battery a dead CMOS battery is
definitely something that can cause
issues swap at our share one receipt
your RAM I'm feeling if Rams not stated
rate then you would not be able to build
a successful boot up through there or
people saying you've got bad capacitors
and your motherboards just dead which
could also be a problem you know but hey
try that others other stuff and see if
any of it helps that hopefully got some
suggestions there flippin Fred thanks
for five bucks
thank you again you got a raise on
patreon meet thank you flip and Fred
thanks I appreciate that I'm gonna say
thanks even though I don't benefit at
all from Kyle's patreon but you know I
appreciate it you you don't it makes a
Kyle Kyle katrien so he's gonna benefit
from it well if you were contributor
like these gentle people are then you
would benefit you would have seen my
awesome intel sketch by now oh yeah I
still haven't seen your Intel sketch
supposed to check that out yeah Haden
Haslam Haden oh I have dollars thanks
again thanks Hayden training 21 you know
Sariah turning 21 in a week and I was
going to buy a beer glass from each of
your sites but the shipping cost more
than my Kart totals why um it could be
maybe based on your location
yeah if you're abroad or if you're
overseas then the shipping can be pretty
pricey I think
t-shirt guy our merch guy is actually
sort of undergoing like a new shipping
or he's looking into new shipping
methods yeah he keeps trying to tweak
stuff to make it a little bit less
expensive yeah he's trying to work on it
so we do apologize and if you artifice
if you order from both of our stores you
will at the same time especially if you
put a note it will get shipped together
and then you'll get a refund for part of
your shipping cost so that will probably
help you out you know especially for
shipping a couple glasses yeah but sorry
about that
we know shipping costs can suck
especially if you're out of the country
yeah you know what the best thing to do
is just buy a ton of stuff from
both of our stores that way that way
it'll outweigh the price of the shipping
for sure you know it's way too good I'm
a serpent xsf for the 10 bucks cents
Yuma set up on Twitter is there a
difference between custom sleeved
extensions and regular sleeved modular
cables the PSU vendors sell um yeah
there is generally I mean you're getting
a different quality it's from a
different company if you're buying it
sleeved extensions every company has
their own sort of level degree of
quality how they sleeve of the material
they use if you're just getting it from
the power supply vendors themselves
generally I mean you're you know those
aren't going to be extensions right I
think that's what he's talking about if
they're just straight straight Abel's
that go directly no I mean if you'd like
if you're talking about like EVGA EVGA
sells complete replacement cable kits
yeah they're all use um they work just
as well but just the level of quality
might vary from vendor to vendor yeah
and materials used I mean any any any
sleeved kit you're gonna buy at a
certain price point price is gonna be
like you get what you pay for so you
know a full kits from a custom place
like insourced customs or something like
that is going to cost 90 to like 130
hundred forty bucks depending on how
many cables you're buying right but it's
all hands done it'll be show material
like like paracord instead of
instead of alternative materials yeah
let's see the material that's a nylon
based right materials basically so yeah
yeah that's pretty true you get what you
pay for like I've used the EVGA ones and
you know they're nice that the
replacement kits that they sell they're
not as nice as like the in source stuff
no I've ever heard of stuff you get from
like who else have we have we kind of
heard from recently who does that
man cream custom matron customs does it
wise mods
well yeah was mods this is a smaller and
I know a guy but we've met him and he's
he's cool that's cool but yeah I like I
like patronizing some of these the
smaller guys who do it because like I
said they're usually just you know small
businesses with just a few people who
put them together and everything yeah
you can get some pretty nice quality
stuff from them just make sure it's
somebody who's got at least a decent
track record yeah you're going to buy
from and yeah it can really finish off a
build in a great way indeed ghost of
harambe
a 10 British pound pound guys keep up
the awesome work do you have any info on
the new Corsair hydro series also what's
the temperature difference from a 280 to
a 360 red would you say my my core i7 60
50 K is running a bit hot at 4.6 I don't
have any information on the on the new
coarser hydro series I didn't actually
take a close look at it at Computex did
you yeah mister updating a hydro series
the blocks are RGB they look a little
bit nicer I think they have three layers
of RGB like a base around the outside
edge and sort of a ring around the
middle and then the Corsair logo in the
middle that lights up too which I
thought all looks pretty cool cuz I'm
still sleeved or is the tubing a little
different now the tubing I did not get a
good look at I can't say but it didn't
stand out to me as any different I like
the sleeve tubing that they do it's kind
of thicker yeah I think it looks pretty
good and I believe they're switching up
to
a fluid dynamic bearing fans okay which
is the chair now instead of ball bearing
yeah which is cool and they and they do
have they did have a 360 millimeter
version on display which is cool as well
as far as the temperature differences it
I don't know it kind of ranges depending
on the hardware that you're cooling I
would say but if you're just talking
about a CPU you will notice a couple
degrees cooler generally speaking I feel
like you're still going to be pretty
good if you're just if you're just
calling that CPU at 280 is going to be
fine
a 360 is going to be marginally better
but as long as you're well below your TJ
Max like you it's you don't really need
to cool it like 5 degrees cooler when
it's already 30 degrees cooler than TJ
max if that makes sense
yeah and when you're talking about
radiator size for something like that
it's not going to be as effective when
you're talking about like like this the
temperature spikes that you can get as
you increase a CPUs overclock where
typically you need to start adding
voltage and that kind of thing that can
increase dramatically going even with
something like four point five to four
point six four point six to four point
seven increasing your the sizes of your
radiators is more effective for like
adding more hardware to the loop if you
have a CPU and a GPU and then you need
to add another GPU or something like
that is typically more more common for
increasing radiator size versus keeping
the the temperature down with something
like trying to hit just a little bit
higher of an overclock the amount of
heat that can be drawn away by the
liquid moving over the CPU block is the
main issue there versus the radiator
size that you have yeah long story short
you should be fine with it to a crafty
hack thank you much very much crafty $5
if know after party you risk irrelevance
just saying ah I know I know man tell me
about it um deer myself I'm not
promising anything as always but if
wifey sauce can convince me when I get
home to play if she's feeling it then I
might I do want to get back into that
yeah I know I know we've been
totally okay I'm done in like totally
yeah but um but still getting over
jetlag believe it or not it takes a good
to two weeks to get completely back to
normal it does I can't promise that I'm
gonna be awake early tonight especially
in the sushi coma um Bobby jr. from ten
dollar donation with CPU and GPU would
you put into a console killer to compete
with the Xbox one X performance and also
compete in price um I'd say one of the
newer Pentiums maybe that means you can
pretty solid like it's hard to build a
$500 computer it's probably gonna be
less about like here's what I can build
for 500 bucks and more about like bright
ears here's double the performance for
like a hundred and fifty bucks more or
something like that yeah
but also hard to say because this is all
stuff that's just been announced so
right um yeah that's that's very
difficult to say I'll stop in my head
I'd say try to build the cheapest
computer Possible's like one of the quad
core rise in CPUs and like an RX 570 or
something like that yeah but that's
probably going to be a decent amount
above 500 bucks right now Schrute
but yeah I'm sure and once we get more
details on the one Xbox one X and all
that stuff there'll be a lot more of
like here's how to build a faster
computer for this much money yeah Dan
Blake five bucks Canadian Kyle no
yawning alright hey guys big fan I've
got a FX 8350 compared with a gtx 1066
gig i'm wondering when I upgrade
platforms should I go 7700
or rise in 1,700 X at this point I lean
towards 1,700 X just because I like more
cores I like more threads and you can
get into that for less money more
versatile cheaper yeah lucky dog twenty
four or five dollar donation 7700 K for
streaming while gaming or sacrifice uh
my PC for more cores again sacrifice
more talk about streaming and gaming I'd
go for more course do you risin Ian
Stickles $5 tickles thang
so much have you guys heard anything
about the 1080 TI Poseidon seems to be
out of stock everywhere
that seems to be an issue I saw I saw a
tweet of a picture of it today up the
box that's close enough that's a fence
it's a closest you'll ever get to
Poseidon dose enough for us yeah but I
don't know maybe that's something that
will that you know they're gonna do it
just a slow launch of and it'll be hard
to find for a while automatic match $5
Kyle take my money I'm late
thanks Mac thank you very much Matt it's
okay if you're late money taking next
time you should come early knotting up
to $95 asus vs acer monitors which would
you recommend they're both great yeah
almost fantastically both do a pretty
decent job you guys um probably all
right so my not I mean it depends they
both have high-end lines and they both
have budget lines yes pens I'm like
they're very they'd stay stay pretty
competitive don't want the one I like
the look of the best yeah focus on size
the type of panel that's that it is the
color depth that's available the refresh
rate whether or not has do you sink or
freesync support hopefully one or the
other and then compare the offerings
from both and hopefully you can find one
that's like on it's on sale yes stuff
but that's yeah honestly when it comes
down to it the panels that they use a
lot of their auditors are going to come
from the same manufacturers anyway so
it's just a matter of am like the kind
of housing that's built around it and
how much people are talking about your
fan but I'm a your shield fan sorry I
turned a fan off okay
fans causing problems all right Matt
right elderly Bryant f4 $5 thank you
both for inspiring me to work toward
getting in the plus certification
tragedies of the great work and I hope
to have it by the end of July yeah
awesome man that's that's really great
Crampton graduations um thanks Brad it's
kind of funny that we inspired you to do
that because neither of us have an
a-plus surgery no nothing we're hardly
educated I I barely made made it out of
junior high you know junior high
it's pretty done back that mr. mr. high
higher education over here alright
alright thanks guys let's gonna do wait
Johnson's oh yeah Johnson's John's
creeping up so Luke job reaping up on
you when you least expect it
I can't tell or how to access Gmail oh
good I have no Johnson's really not good
but we can end the show a little bit I
have held a couple a couple Johnson's no
one uh Johnson for Jacob who got the
thumbscrew men's heavy metal gray
t-shirt which I believe is the same
t-shirt that I'm wearing right now
Jingleheimer which has a little bit of B
right here who try to see that it's fun
sorry about that cuddle every shirt
comes with an original stain I'll go
away though I will go away and Ryan
Thank You Ryan from Virginia who got a
20-ounce pub less actually two 20 ounce
per glasses thanks thanks very much
right and Kyle has nothing no no ha ha
ha ha I'll totally sell more than you
Mendell stuff on my half of the show
yeah we're gonna take short break if
you're watching YouTube will be my half
on the link in the description if you're
watching twitch stay right where you are
we will keep it we'll keep it going
well BRB guys thank you so much for
