house which was about a week ago now I
have not uploaded a single actual tech
video to the channel which really pains
me inside I don't like it apart from
unpacking and settling into the new
house one of the biggest reasons for
that is not having a proper set studio
office saying whatever you want to call
this room that we're in right here for
starters echo echo is absolutely
atrocious to the point where I don't
even feel right recording this video
right now so we're actually gonna fix
that by installing some or I should say
wall mounting some acoustic foam panels
as well as dressing up this superbear
wall behind me so I actually got a
couple of these tool you know those peg
boards actually got two of these I'm
gonna mount them side-by-side here maybe
get some acoustic panels to line the top
and bottom of that once both of those
tests are complete so pretty much by the
end of this video I will be more
equipped and actually ready to create
some quality tech videos for you guys
once again which I can't wait to do so
for starters let's let's get the let's
get the show on the road let me just
really quickly tell you how I'm gonna do
this this foam panel business so I've
got let's see three 12-packs about three
twelve packs there a square foot each
and two inches thick so what I did here
I took a bunch of cardboard boxes from
from our move actually which came in
really handy you cut them down to size
to about a square foot actually a little
bit less and we're gonna take some spray
adhesive to the back of each foam panel
stick them onto the cardboard and then
flip it over and put these command
strips on each corner before mounting it
to the wall if you guys aren't familiar
with these command strips they're
absolutely awesome I'll put a link in
the description if you're interested
they're great for hanging things they
have small medium and large ones super
easy to install but more importantly
easy to remove without damaging your
paint as far as design choice or
patterns I'm not gonna do anything fancy
I'm just gonna do like three large
squares three panels tall and three
panels wide three of those squares boom
boom boom and probably spaced them out
you know a couple inches apart and did
some quick measurements and that should
fill up a pretty good chunk of this wall
I'll talk more about these peg boards
when we get around to them but for now
let's get cracking on these guys because
this echo sucks so actually that echo
impressions suck
all right all the acoustic foam panels
are now adhered to their individual
cardboard pieces that took a little bit
longer than expected even with whyphy
sauces amazing help simply because we
just didn't have a great spray can of a
spray adhesive it was kind of lousy it
wasn't ejecting much out at a time
didn't hold very well or dry quickly
enough so after that can burned out I
went back to the hardware store to buy
more spray adhesive this time going with
the 3m brand and that worked just fine
actually was I was much easier at that
point now one thing I overlooked here is
that we actually have to wait for this
to dry before we can mount them to the
wall simply because the smell the smell
is pretty few me and toxic and we don't
want that in the house at least with the
cats in there so we're gonna have to
leave this to dry possibly overnight and
we'll come back to it tomorrow to
finally put them on the wall but for now
let's go back inside the house so we've
got six of these peg boards that we're
gonna be putting side-by-side just like
this the other three are in a different
room right now but we're gonna be
bending those to the wall of course and
whyphy sauce actually had the great idea
of basically laying all these panels
flat down on a piece of paper like a
thin piece of wax paper and then tracing
with a pen where all the mounting holes
were so that we could tape the paper on
the wall and simply use them as guides
for drilling our holes we made sure
everything's nice and level the only
issue here is that this wall actually
has a pretty steep curvature to it if
you take this ruler you can see the wall
is not straight it's a rounded wall it's
just it was improperly built or whatever
so my only concern is that we traced
this on a flat floor and when we mount
it on this curved wall I really hope
that all the holes line up with the
holes on that one way to find out
ok so it's been about 10 minutes since
the last clip and our drill died yeah we
didn't get very far we did drill all of
our pilot holes so that's good but since
it's pretty late by now we'll probably
just pick this up tomorrow morning the
batteries fully charged and we can
finish mounting this as well as all the
acoustic panels that are currently
drying in the garage so I'm gonna go to
bed and I'll see you guys in the morning
all right it's the next day and I am
feeling fully recharged too just like my
drill here so let's look at those
beauties just sitting there all
straightened pretty actually really like
in the way this looks so far now it's
not 100% glare free you can sort of see
the reflection of this light right here
but it's honestly not too terrible I've
been in the game long enough to know the
camera tricks you can kind of just move
the camera or change lighting position
in order to minimize those reflections
this is already a huge step up from
having a blank white wall behind me in
my videos but still pretty plain and
boring so I'm gonna head to the garage
grab some things to start decorating
this backdrop just to give it a little
bit more character
all right that took a bit longer than
expected just because there's a lot of
stuff a lot of possibilities I guess
that that could have gone on this wall
but here it is yeah there's the sort of
a blend of things here so some of these
things are actually functional and serve
serve purpose like like all these tools
here that I actually frequently use and
then some of it's really just for decor
you know and just for looking pretty so
that you guys don't have to just stare
at my ugly face the whole time there's a
couple fun quirks about this wall you
can see that some things actually have
power or g.skill memory there this
keyboard and and so forth and basically
it's kind of Handy actually even though
it's not intentional
all these peg boards have these holes
obviously for the mounting screws
there's three of them on either side
which I routed most of the cables right
through so it pretty much hides a good
majority of the cables you can see a
little bit here and there but it really
gets the most hairy right here because
that's where our power strips are but
actually somewhat strategically placed
that to be right behind me for what I'm
shooting most videos so you won't be
seeing that too much of course when
Paul's here for awesome hardware we'll
be two presenters split so you might be
able to see that section a little bit
more but I don't know and I think it
looks kind of cool especially because
we've got our little Intel look here
with the tiny monitor this is featured
in the tiny gaming PC video that I did a
while back and the reason I have a look
here in the first place is because the
keyboard this is the control keyboard
from master op it wasn't holding a
charge it just wasn't holding power when
plugged into here this this USB hub or
even directly to the power strip so I
just thought well I'll just wall mount
to PC and that should hold the power and
sure enough it does now these power
strips the cords for these are kind of
an eyesore against this white wall I
don't know if I mentioned it before I
kind of wanted to melt at least one row
of acoustic foam panels below since
they're black it'll be black on black
and that that cord will sort of blend in
a little bit plus I'll be like I
mentioned standing or sitting in front
of this area for most of my videos but I
wanted to point that out because I know
someone in the comments is gonna be like
that looks horrible it completely ruins
your entire set and USAC speaking of
those foam panels this wall is looking
awfully bare now especially next to the
one we just worked on and I believe the
acoustic foam panels are dry by now in
the
Raaj so I think it's about time we slap
them off
all right look at that
three big ol squares turned out pretty
nice there are a couple quirks though
not all the squares we're exactly the
same size and so you see sort of on the
edges I couldn't really get all of them
100% lined up kind of just bothers me it
really kicks my OCD into gear and if I
were to slide this panel for example to
be flush with this one then there would
be a gap in between those two panels
that was the best I could do but they
don't look bad and and really they're
more for function than they are form so
I don't know if you guys can tell but it
sounds a lot less echoing here to me you
guys let me know what you think if this
seems to help a bit I'm gonna mount him
side by side here maybe get some
acoustic panels to line the top and
bottom of that I don't know if you guys
can tell but it sounds a lot less
echoing here to me you guys let me know
what you think I also put a single row
of panels above the pegboard so I did
not have enough foam for the bottom row
so that'll have to come later I think it
looks good
it definitely adds some contrast to the
gray panels and of course further sound
deadening is always nice now the studio
lighting is not set up yet I mean I've
got the lights on stuff but I mean look
at this sad diffuser the nice big
diffuser solution that I had at the old
office is in the garage right now
because it's just too big but the C
stand that it needs for this little
space so I'm actually have to buy some
more equipment online to accommodate a
smaller sized room and then play with
the lights a little bit more to really
finesse the set lighting and also I was
thinking you know initially I was like
okay well I'll just shoot from here from
this angle just do a straight shot like
I've done in the past but then I was
kind of playing around with angles and I
was thinking this looks like it it just
gives the shot to kind of give the shot
more depth to shoot sort of at an angle
here so I'm gonna play around with it
and I'm sure you guys will see slight
iterations from video to video as I
slowly nail down exactly what I'm
looking for so that's pretty much rich
what do you guys think I'm kind of
scared really to hear your to hear your
thoughts but also excited to hear your
feedback so feel free to blow it up down
below guys that's gonna do it for me
thank you so much for watching I'll so
like on the video if you enjoyed it
subscribe for more tech stuff shut up
phone have a good one and I'll see y'all
in the next video
you
oh yeah I don't want to be in the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
