what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well today
I'm taking a look at this backpack from
in case this is the eeo travel backpack
and it's it's actually something that
I've bought with my own money because I
needed it it's not a this isn't a
sponsored video I've never spoken to
anyone at encase before I'd never even
heard of the brand until I did a bit of
research online looking for a backpack
that would suit my personal needs and
this is one of the options that popped
up so I decided to roll the dice and
pull the trigger today I'm gonna be
sharing with you my experience with it
so far so far I have taken one business
trip with it I just came back yesterday
it was a four day long business trip
this is the only bag I brought apart
from a camera bag which you know fit my
laptop a seed after all the accessories
and my clothing as well I paid a hundred
and fifty dollars for this thing on
amazon which i think is a pretty fair
price point for a quality backpack
I bought backpacks for 30 bucks 50 bucks
75 bucks and what I've noticed if you go
under $100 most of the time if you
travel as much as someone like me they
tend to wear out pretty quickly I mean
these things sustain a lot of wear and
tear and you you end up finding yourself
having to replace them almost annually
so I decide to fork out a little bit of
money it's not an extreme amount but
hopefully this is gonna last me a bit
longer because it is sort of that next
two-year of quality for what you're
paying this is the heather gray model it
does also come in black the only
difference was scientist IDEs the colors
that the black one actually has a bit
more weather proofing on the front the
front pouch area here so if you live in
really rainy or snowy conditions you
might want to consider that but I went
with heather gray because I personally
think it looks nicer just a you know a
subjective thing and also it sort of
stands out among the crowd at an airport
among all the other black bags out there
so if I just need a really quickly
located or if I misplace it it's a bit
easier for me to spot I'm really happy
with how it looks in person just as much
as I was attracted to it online I think
it looks great overall it's very stylish
and stuff kind of modern and whatnot
definitely more modern than all my other
so far and it's it's got the quality to
back it up as well for starters it's got
sort of a polyester material and even
though it's not fully waterproof it's
not gonna survive like a rainstorm or
anything like that it is fairly weather
resistant so you're not gonna find that
all the contents have been soaked after
a little bit of drizzle or snow
obviously I live in Southern California
so that's not a huge issue to me it
might be for you taking a look at the
back we get some wide shoulder straps
with padding underneath it's very
comfortable it's the same exact padding
that you'll find on the back panel here
these two large strips and sort of a
space in between just for additional
breathability so you don't overheat from
wearing this for long periods of time
that's starting to sound like a PC
review and it's extremely comfortable
all the padding on this thing is very
high-quality and I didn't find myself
having any fatigue of the back from
wearing this you know couple hours at a
time the one downfall here and this is
going to be a pro for some of you a con
for some is gonna be the sternum strap I
don't like these are not a fan of
sternum straps I never use them and I
just feel like they get in the way and
unfortunately there's no way to remove
them naturally so if I really wanted to
get rid of them I'd have to take some
scissors and just permanently cut them
off now on top of the backpack you get a
thick carrying handle which definitely
feels sturdy enough to support any
amount of weight that you could possibly
cram into this thing and you've also got
the same sort of handle on the side of
the backpack if you want to carry it
like a briefcase the one downfall here
is that there's no way to actually tuck
away the shoulder strap so they're kind
of just loosely hanging about as you
carry it sideways which is kind of
awkward and a little bit cumbersome
slightly annoying so it seems like a
half-baked thought that being said it is
just nice to have a handle on the side
for easy carrying and you know picking
it up off the conveyor belt and things
like that
another feature have a surprise to find
missing here is a luggage strap I think
that would've been really convenient for
me personally because I often bring my
rolling suitcase with me to the airport
and since I don't have one here I
basically have to wrap the shoulder
straps around the carrying handle of my
my rolling suitcase which obviously
isn't quite as ideal but not a huge deal
breaker I think just for a hundred fifty
bucks it would have been nice to pop one
of those on there but what can you do
now let's talk about the pouches this is
where it gets fun talking about all the
compartmentalization and things like
that so first off starting with the
pouch that's closest to your back I
guess
rearmost pouch we have a pouch for your
laptop the cool thing about this is that
it unzips all the way the zipper goes
all the way to the bottom of the
suitcase allowing you to completely
unfold this portion of your backpack
which is where your laptop sleeve is the
sleeve supports up to 17 inch laptops I
have a razor blade Pro in here currently
which is actually a little bit larger
than 17 inches if it's no problem the
inside is lined with a very nice faux
fur material so it doesn't get all
scratched up but the beauty of it being
able to lay completely flat like this is
when you're going through TSA security
you basically don't have to remove your
laptop at all
you basically just unzip it and send it
straight through the x-ray because
there's nothing that's there's no
pouches above or beneath your laptop
basically isolating it and allowing the
TSA agents or whatever to properly
inspect your laptop with you never
having to actually remove it that's
fantastic
you can also see we have a half sized
pouch here it's just a single pocket
this is gonna be really nice for mouse
pads and tablets and things like that
things that are more flat because you
obviously don't want anything too bulky
resting up right against your back next
up we have the main compartment and it's
gonna be used mainly for your clothing
toiletries and things like that if
you're going on extended trips or you
just need to pack an extra change of
clothes etc the great thing about this
pouch and probably one of the key
selling points for me is that it is
expandable there's another zipper that
if you undo it it'll actually allow you
to expand that main compartment capacity
over 35% so that's gonna be great for
when you're going on longer trips like
the one that I just came back from I was
able to again store four days of clothes
inside of this backpack with all my
other stuff right now I actually have
two pairs of jeans some socks
undergarments and I think like five or
six shirts that are in here right now
on the right side of this main
compartment you get a large mesh flap
that zips up and once you open that you
pretty much put all of your larger
articles of clothing there and then a
smaller mesh pouch on the left side
unfortunately that's it there's I wish
there was a third one there's still like
this empty sort of wasted space next to
that smaller pouch that I feel like they
could have added a couple more pockets
there just for convenience sake now I
did not pack an extra pair of shoes with
me for my most recent business trip but
you shouldn't have any problem fitting
you know some tennis shoes in here or
definitely a pair of sandals assuming
that you're not completely maxing this
thing out to the brim and I should also
mention that you do get a maximum
capacity of 24 litres in the entire pack
assuming that you undo the expansion
zipper that we mentioned earlier
moving on here we've got a small quick
access pouch located right next to the
top carrying handle that's lined with
the same faux fur material that we saw
on the laptop sleeve this is great for
smaller items that you need to get at a
moment's notice like your phone keys
wallet earbuds and so forth and as we
make our way forward we have one of two
front pouches this is the larger one and
it's it's it's pretty great it's got
eight different pockets in here all of
different shapes and sizes so we've got
room for battery packs AC adapters I
currently have a gaming mouse in there a
toothbrush good fit pens and pencils
charging cables business cards passports
it's great and actually the the two
bottom pouches are actually made of mesh
and they have these sort of elastic
bands so it's very it's very smart
designed one minor gripe I do have
however is that since this pouch is so
deep because it's such a tall and narrow
backpack I do wish the zipper on this
pouch would go down a little bit further
just in case I drop some smaller items
at the very bottom I wouldn't have to
quite fish around as much be a little
bit easier to access but again a minor
complaint there and at the very front we
have our fifth and final pouch which is
just a single half sized pocket there's
no compartmentalization in here this is
great for just flat items maybe paper
documents like your boarding pass
receipts etc so yeah that's that's
pretty much it guys my experience with
this thing so far is that I'm not
returning it let's put it that way
I spent a hundred fifty bucks on it and
I really considered the fact or the
possibility that I would be returning it
after my business trip that I just took
if it didn't work out for me but you
know what I love it it's actually really
really comfortable and it fits
everything I need to for a weekend long
trip which is something that I take very
often I'm going to press conferences I
need to throw in an editing laptop and
have a few changes of clothes this is
absolutely perfect for me so if you guys
