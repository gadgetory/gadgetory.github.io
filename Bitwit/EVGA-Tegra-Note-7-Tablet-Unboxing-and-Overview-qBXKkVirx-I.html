awesomesauce news today I'm taking a
look at a pretty sweet product this is
the Tegra note 7 from EVGA and I know
you're thinking tiger oh that's that's
Nvidia isn't it and the box is green so
it must be which is totally true this
tablet does feature a Tegra 4 processor
from Nvidia and in fact to my knowledge
I think this product was almost entirely
forged in Nvidia warehouse so at that
point or Nvidia factory I should say so
at that point you're wondering why the
hell is the name evj slapped on here in
the first place well this is my theory
is that Nvidia doesn't really sell
products right they kind of make a cool
product and then they have another
company sell it for them I think the
Nvidia shield is like the only thing I
can think of right now in recent years
recently anyway that that Nvidia has
actually taken and marketed themselves
and is selling on their website directly
so with I think with what happened here
is they made a cool product this tablet
and then they reached out to one of
their trusted board partners EVGA to
help them distribute it and to help them
market it and use their distribution
expertise to help them sell more units
at the end of the day which is fine by
me as long as it's a reasonable or as
long as it's a good product at a
reasonable price point and I think it is
for all the features that you get with
this this tablet is at a very attractive
price of $1.99 at least at the time of
filling this video and the time of its
release so let's take a look at it right
now and let's start off with opening up
the box alright so the first thing you
will find upon opening up the box is
what looks to be a Quick Start Guide
take a quick look at that ok ooh specs
here we go we'll take a look at a few of
these it's got video Tegra 4 of course
1.8 gigahertz quad-core processor cortex
a15 72 chord video GeForce GPU does
1080p video decoding and coding and
recording it's got 1 gig of ram ddr3 L
1600 speed at twelve point eight
gigabytes per second and those are all
the other hardware issue specs that I'm
gonna get into more when I look at the
tablet itself oh here's some diagrams of
the tablet more hardware features that
they point out there some more general
instructions on charging your battery
charging your battery turning off and on
the Tegra note pretty simple stuff if
you've used a tablet once or twice
before you probably don't need to look
through this guide very extensively but
it's just there for reference in case
you need it here's the tablet itself ooh
it's got a nice weight to it
I actually like that I'm gonna get more
into that just a bit and here I'm
guessing are your charging accessories
like you're a
the wall adapter that has a USB
connector there so you can plug it into
or plug this cable into it this is your
micro USB charging cable that you can
use either with that included wall
adapter or with a PC charger with your
laptop or an external battery pack and
other similar devices so here's the
tablet here's the face of it obviously
and the first thing you might notice or
probably not because it's a little funky
angle are the speakers so you've got a
speaker up top and one at the bottom
once again these are front-facing
speakers and they're being advertised as
HD audio speakers powered by Nvidia
spear Audio technology which is
apparently a good thing and they look
they look pretty decent they almost
cover the entire width of the tablet so
we're gonna test that out in just a bit
when we get into the operating system so
from then you also have a front-facing
VGA camera if you want to do some video
chatting or if you want to take a selfie
something like that whoo you also get a
7 inch IPS panel Jesus that reflection
I'm really sorry guys
7 inch IPS panel 20 I'm sorry 25 60 yeah
I just bought a high-res panel so it's
totally 2560 by 1440 get my numbers
confused it's 1280 by 800 resolution not
the best resolution that we've seen even
on tablets this size but it's it's a 7
inch tablet for 200 bucks what do you
want and I'm sure it's still gonna look
pretty nice when we turn it on it is IPS
afterall and you can see that the bezel
is isn't too thick this this tablet does
not suffer from thick bezel syndrome
like a lot of older tablets do and even
some of the more recent ones just look
hideous because the screen to bezel
ratio is just out of control why don't
we take a look at some of the features
Hardware features on the sides on the
edges here first off you've got a micro
SD card slot and that reminds me this
does have built-in 16 gigs of nand this
is expandable however up to 32 gigs of
memory if you want to put in an SD card
there you also get a volume rocker of
course on the down here on the down low
I'm gonna sit on the down low down here
you get a stylus which I was mentioning
earlier and this is a really cool stylus
let me show you why first off I think
they might sell interchangeable heads
you could probably take this off and
screw in another one maybe EVGA or
nvidia sell it on their website i'm not
too sure but you can see here this is a
special stylus because that it has a
really fine tip on one edge and then
it's kind of round it's kind of slanted
at an angle so if you want to do like
right
just straight-up like writing
note-taking you use that chiseled edge
but if you want to use like a paintbrush
app or something like that and you're
doing some artistic stuff you have a
wider edge right here to make those
wider strokes so gives you some
versatility an additional layer of
functionality when you're using a tablet
with a stylus which is always nice to
see a bit of innovation there and it
just tucks right into the bottom and it
actually stays in pretty well so it
doesn't accidentally get lost when
you're carrying it around and such over
here you've got your micro USB charging
port you've got a micro HDMI port as
well if you want to plug this in and
have your image or your video being
output to a larger TV or monitor you can
do so you've got an analogue jack for
your audio for your headphones and
you've got a sleep button put your
tablet to sleep or wakes it up also
turns it on and off we all know how that
works and let's take a look at the back
here I guess this kind of brings me to
construction this this whole thing is
pretty much made of plastic as far as
like the top and bottom where the
speakers are obviously the LCD is glass
but on the back here you've got two
areas of plastic here but in the middle
you have more rubberized texture and
we've kind of seen this on a lot of
tablets in recent years even more
recently there's a Tegra note and EVGA
branding there but I'm not sure how much
functionality the this rubberized
texture actually serves because when you
hold the tablet most of the time most
people to my knowledge actually hold it
with one thumb here and maybe the rest
of your fingers here you might have one
finger in the back so it gives you a
little bit of grip that way I guess
you'd have more functionality with it
more luck better grip if you were
holding it in landscape mode like that
that way you can definitely feel more of
the rubber and it feels a little bit
more secure in your hands
aside from that you also do get a rear
facing camera that's a 5 megapixel
camera also does HD video recording it's
got a 41 milliamp battery and EVGA and
Nvidia are advertising up to 10 hours of
HD video playback I don't have 10 hours
to really confirm or deny that statement
so maybe if one of you guys pick this up
and you have the 10 hours you can let me
know in the comment section below if
that's a true statement
cuz that'd be pretty cool but enough
about hardware why don't we get into the
operating system because we haven't
really gone over that yet and there's
some pretty cool things to be seen so
let's do that alright guys so here we
are into the operating system and you
could probably tell that this is running
Android 4.2.2 jelly bean to be exact and
this is going to offer you a very
here Android experience there's not
going to be any kind of skin that goes
over this any third-party application
like that running over it so there's no
bloatware it's just pure Android very
much similar to the the Nvidia shield
for that matter I'm gonna show you guys
really quickly what happens when you
take the stylus outside of its little
silo there you can see the Nvidia direct
stylus launcher has popped up and it's a
pretty cool app that basically just
automatically detects when you've taken
the stylus out and it kind of guesses
well you're probably gonna want to use
one of these apps if you're taking the
stylus out and you can always add
applications to the direct stylus
launcher so if you tend to look prefer
the stuff using the stylus when you're
on YouTube a lot you can add YouTube to
the direct stylus launcher and anytime
you pull the stylus out it will suggest
YouTube as one of the apps you might be
wanting to use at that very moment so
this is a good example a good time for
us to go into tegra draw let's do right
first I'm going to write this is just a
basic note taking application and I'm
gonna write a note what should I write
hmm
let's do this forgive my awful cursive
yes Wow
that was that was pretty bad I'm not
done yet
this is obviously taking advantage of
that really fine tip the very point of
it
as you can see the the thickness of what
of the point that I'm writing with is
very thin so this is great this is a
great stylist for when you want to do
thin stuff like that get really fine
details if you wanted to like fill in
something really tiny you could totally
do that but why don't we go on to the
painting app that's a little bit more
fun than just note-taking let me see if
I can get here there we go
tegra draw is the name of the app and
here we can see that I can still utilize
that really thin point on the stylus if
I want to make some thinner designs
thinner strokes but as soon as I flip it
over a bit and start using the other
side you can see how much thicker the
lines get and this is really kind of
cool because it lets you just do
infinitely more things with your stylus
as opposed to just being limited to one
thickness and of course there are
several apps that
you to change the thickness of your
stylus or of your paintbrush and that's
always fine and dandy but it's really so
much easier just to be able to turn your
pen a little bit and do that dynamically
on the fly the other thing I forgot to
mention about this pen this stylus is
that it's pressure-sensitive which is a
huge thing that for me to overlook so
I'm sorry about that but you can see
here if I just lightly brush it I'm just
barely grazing over I mean I'm even
missing contact at some points and you
can see how thin the line gets kind of
like a zebra almost but if as soon as I
press down on it the lines get a lot
thicker and just kind of fill up a lot
more but wait there's more that I forgot
to mention about the cool little stylus
pen thingy and for that we're gonna go
into Chrome really quick and the thing I
forgot to point out to you guys was the
awesome lasso tool that you can use in
literally any application on this tablet
at any time you just select it and it
lets you select whatever you want you
literally just draw around it like a
lasso tool and you can instantly share
with your friends and family or whoever
via Gmail Bluetooth whatever so pretty
much self-explanatory I thought it was
really cool feature and worth pointing
out why don't we move on to a more
general demonstration let's just see how
speedy this the CPU is the Tegra 4 by
opening up a browser like Chrome and
just kind of playing around on a website
for a while and honestly we're at
newegg.com for no particular reason of
course but really not every app should
be used with a stylus pen it's only you
know a best-case scenario for for some
applications I think for the web browser
I think we're gonna use the good old
finger this guy right here so excuse me
I just burped that's nasty so scrolling
is a pretty fluid you can kind of double
tap to zoom in and out you can also do
the whole pinch to zoom of course I
shouldn't I shouldn't look at the the
camera LCD I should just look straight
at the tablet because it's messing me up
but here we go
let's just tap computer hardware with my
fat finger oh okay
there we go and let's check out this you
know I don't want to can't look
competitor products let's just look at
this Rosewill case cuz Rosewell doesn't
make tablets yet ah there you go
pretty fluid experience if I want to go
check out something more detail let's
let's see how crisp or
how much aliasing we get out of text you
know what it's actually really crisp for
being a 1280 by 800 resolution it
actually I don't see any aliasing at all
on this on this text right here which is
really really nice impressive why don't
we go to the Google the Google app the
YouTube app look up an awesomesauce
video oh wow somebody's been browsing
here and what a coincidence awesomesauce
news is the only thing they've ever
searched for it must be a really good
YouTube channel so let's click a video
like this let's see what how a video
playback goes video streaming in HD
there's a talking head I'm not
comfortable with that so I'm going to
skip it so here's an HD video of me
building a computer and stuff getting
rid of my old one this would be a great
time to actually turn up the volume and
maybe hear oh my gosh I just powered it
off or I just made it go to sleep sorry
yeah all right as I was saying this
would be a great time to test the audio
the speaker's here crank it up
have a listen you're listening to this
these are the front-facing speakers on
the tablet and it's coming into my
lavalier mic that's currently clipped to
my shirt so take that for what you will
I'll let you listen to the music for a
little while watch a bit of awesomesauce
it actually sounds pretty good I'm not
gonna lie
yeah you know what for tablet speakers
they're actually pretty good I've heard
a lot worse and I guess that pier audio
technology from Nvidia really does does
help in that regard that's cool that's
enough when we got to the CPU I think
that's I think you guys know the rest
but here is a youtube pretty much and
it's also very fluid and responsive kind
of see what other channels we can look
at here there's a bunch of stuff I can't
really play any of their videos though
because then they'll sue me and I'll be
even more on the hole than I already am
all right guys so the last app that I'm
demoing for you today is the camera
application and really there's not too
much to say about it doesn't have that
many bells and whistles to it but
there's one thing worth mentioning it
does come with the SmugMug camera
awesome app which is a pretty much
whoops I don't I don't want to go to
Facebook anyway it's one of the top
camera apps on iOS devices and this is
the first Android device it's actually
being offered on to my knowledge and it
lets you do cool things like take
slow-motion shots at a hundred frames
per second and put on a bunch of extra
filters honestly I'm not too big into
the whole mobile device photography
craze that's going on that's been going
on for the last few years but some of
you are I'm sure and I guess it's worth
noting for you guys so here we are
inside the camera application and I've
decided to use my dt 880 pros as the
subject of my shooting just because they
look nice and pretty much standard
camera features you can actually tap to
autofocus which is really handy here are
some other features here you've got your
single straight-up shoot burst auto
burst HDR self timer you can do
intervals continuous bursting and
there's image stabilization you you also
have all these features for video only
the ones that apply to video of course
you have panorama that's also cool let's
see what else we got here
let's go back to the single camera mode
and obviously you can do video let's
take a look at these settings for video
here you can do ISO settings auto white
balance
I think that's brightness yes that is
definitely brightness pretty cool you
can also switch it to the front-facing
camera oh gosh that's creepy switch it
back switch it back alright
you'll you've also got a little leveler
there it tells you exactly if your if
your pictures straight if you are
parallel to the tops and bottoms of
you're shot kind of a useful feature you
can make it go away if you want you also
get all this stuff it tells you little
grids if you want to do a little bit
more professional shooting and you care
more about I guess the placement of
things in your in your photo and your
photography you can access these little
grids and they will help you in your
aesthetic eye I'm not making sense right
now but you get the point
all right guys that's gonna wrap it up
for this unboxing and overview once
again this has been EVGA s Tegra note 7
tablet powered by Nvidia and this is not
a review video at all and in fact I only
spent a couple hours with this thing so
I don't really feel like I've had enough
time to give you an honest review of it
so far but I can tell you my first
impressions and that is for being at
$200 starting that price point is pretty
appealing for all the features that you
get along with it mainly I'm talking
about the stylus and all the
applications and the software that you
can utilize with it's really optimized
that pen experience on a tablet screen
looks great no aliasing from what I can
tell from my naked eye on text even up
close and it's just a solid all-around
tablet with decent speakers more than
decent speakers and I would I would
recommend it right now but I'd have to
do a full review to do that I highly
recommend that you guys go look at other
articles or videos that do actual
reviews on this product and decide for
yourself if it's the right tablet for
you but that's just my opinion first
