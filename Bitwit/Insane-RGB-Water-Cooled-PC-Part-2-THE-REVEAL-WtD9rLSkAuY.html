two of the ultimate water-cooled RGB PC
brought to you by Thermaltake thanks to
those guys for making this build and
video possible and we're pretty much
gonna pick up right where we left off
which is the hard line tubing we're
gonna make some runs today and hopefully
finish off the build if everything goes
smoothly I would not want this to turn
into a part three or a three-part series
so I'm gonna try to wrap things up by
the end of this video I'm not the most
experienced or proficient when it comes
to tube bending so it should be
interesting we'll wrap things up at the
end of a nice sexy montage with some
closing words and and sort of talk about
my experience the whole way through
again just a refresher you've got a 7900
X here at Quarry 9 from from Intel on
the X 299 platform along with the GT X
1080 from Oris and 64 gigs of DDR for
29:33 from HyperX fully loaded PC we've
got here if you guys are curious at all
I've put links to all this stuff in the
description below feel free to check
that out but we've got a lot of work
ahead of us today so with that said I'm
just gonna go ahead and jump into things
start bending some tubes
all right so about five-ish hours later
we have ourselves a fully functional
water-cooled RGB PC and it looks pretty
glorious in my opinion RGB isn't for
everyone of course but I think it looks
really good especially with all the
thermaltake RGB elements you know we're
kind of dealing with the same ecosystem
there of hardware so it all meshes
together perfectly as you might expect I
also am pretty proud of some of these
runs okay they're not my best runs I'll
admit that but this long one in
particular I was expecting to have to
pull out some of those 90 90 degree
fittings the connectors just to make it
easier on me but I managed to get all
four bends in there on the second try
and you know okay maybe this isn't like
perfectly straight if you pulled out a
protractor or something but you know for
a semi water cooling noob like myself
I'm actually pretty happy with how it
turned out building inside of this case
the level 20 is an absolute dream if
you're a custom water cooler there's
plenty of room for activities I never
felt cramped or pressed for cable
management room at all it is a very
massive case and I guess that is sort of
the trade-off there you're gonna have to
find a place to put it
but overall it's it's been a dream to
build in a couple less things to note
here there is a bit of soft tubing in
this build we have an impostor on our
hands as I mentioned in part one I was
gonna use some soft tubing for the run
between the pump res to the inlet of the
graphics card the tubing actually just
kind of hugs the floor of the chassis
all the way down so it doesn't really
stand out it's not very visible unless
you're really looking for it which is
kind of a point but again I just kind of
used soft tubing there to make my life a
bit easier and finally you might have
noticed that the reservoir isn't fully
topped off it was when I initially
filled the loop and then you know after
a few minutes of running it the liquid
starts to fill up all the air gaps
inside the loop and the water level goes
down a bit if it were my own personal
system of course I topped that off but
as for now I rather like the soothing
sounds of water dripping into a into a
reservoir but that's pretty much all I
got for now guys huge thanks again to
Thermaltake for making this build
possible you can find links once again
to all this stuff in the description
below thank you for watching toss like
on it if you enjoyed it and get
subscribed for more tech stuff right
around the corner you can also check me
out on a floatplane if you want to watch
my videos a whole week early without ads
for 3 bucks a month I'll put a link for
that in the video description until next
time guys thanks for tuning in have a
good one and I'll see you all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
