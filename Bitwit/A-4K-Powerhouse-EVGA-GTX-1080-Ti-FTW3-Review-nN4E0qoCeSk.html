channel hope you're all doing well today
we're taking a look at the GTX 1080 Ti
for the win
3 which is currently EBG A's flagship
Pascal video card for the win 3 sports
an all new cooler and the brand's icx
technology which I've already detailed
in my for the win 2 video but to quickly
recap icx is EVGA sort of umbrella term
for several features that enhance
thermal monitoring and cooling for
starters rather than having just one
thermal sensor on the GPU like most
video cards do icx adds 9 sensors and a
couple microcontrollers to the PCB these
sensors are placed in close proximity to
the memory power and GPU and can be
monitored via precision x OC or with the
card's trio of built-in LED indicators
the LED colors reflect each zones
temperature range for at a glance
monitoring assuming of course you can
physically see the LEDs from where
you're gaming for added customizability
the LED colors and thermal range values
can be reassigned within the software
now of course having more sensors won't
make your card run any faster but having
access to more thermal data can
potentially help users optimize their
custom fan curves
especially with EVGA a synchronous fan
control another icx feature that gives
each fan its own user-defined fan curve
in the case of our for the win 3 here
the triple 90 millimeter double ball
bearing fans target different zones with
the left fan primarily cooling the GPU
and the other two fans serving the
memory and power this sectional cooling
design works for the most part however
heat transfer between components can
still occur since all the elements are
packed together on the same PCB with
that in mind I wouldn't recommend
limiting airflow too aggressively to any
one particular area of the card other
icx notables include a number of bin
holes which promote air flow through the
heatsink and l-shaped fins for increased
surface area and heat dissipation
additional heat absorption is offered by
several of these patented pin feeds
which protrude from the die cast base
plate even the base plate and back plate
serve a functional purpose here by
making direct contact with the main
components using no shortage of thermal
padding so that's a super quick rehash
on IC X and how it's been implemented
onto the Ti for the win 3 it's certainly
not a set of technologies that I would
call vital to the end user
but they can still be valuable to
enthusiasts who demand the additional
control and peace of mind there's more
to talk about though like that gorgeous
as fuck shrapp it's treated with a
powder coated finish that gives it an
almost metallic appearance but it's
actually made of plastic which feels
durable in high quality the
exceptionally open-air design is not
advertised to improve temperatures
though take into consideration that heat
from the card will be exhausted almost
entirely into your chassis the card
measures just under 12 inches long but
maintains reasonable dimensions
elsewhere making it noticeably smaller
than the Asus Strix GTX 1080p eye with
significantly less sack this is a huge
plus apart from the features we've
already discussed the aluminum heatsink
is partitioned into two halves joined by
five six millimeter copper heat pipes or
at least I think they're six millimeters
they definitely look like they're about
six millimeter on the side of the card
you'll find two sli fingers and a large
strip of branding with RGB backlighting
that's fully customizable with the
precision color picker which by the way
is the exact same color picker as the
one in ms paint it'll get a notice EVGA
also on the side of the card is a dual
BIOS switch and a pair of eight pin PCIe
power connectors the beautiful diecast
backplate is lined with ample
ventilation slots and a tasteful RGB
badge that can be synced in perfect
unison with the side lettering these are
quality LEDs with rich accurate color
and no visible hotspots on the back you
get your reference i/o including a dual
link DVI pre DisplayPort 1.4 and an HDMI
2.0 B now to briefly run down some basic
specs and videos GTX 1080p I of course
borrows a modified GP 102 GPU as found
on the Titan X Pascal and more recently
the other Titan X Pascal aka Titan X
little P thanks for making that simple
Nvidia the card sports 3584 cuda cores
and a factory overclock from EVGA to
fifteen hundred and sixty nine megahertz
base and sixteen hundred and
eighty-three megahertz boost we also get
an ample frame buffer of 11 gigs of
gddr5 X at 11 gigabits per second on a
three hundred and fifty two-bit bus
offering up four hundred and eighty four
gigabytes a second of memory bandwidth
while the gtx 980ti is the world's first
single GPU that comfortably and
consistently
4k gaming at 60 plus frames a second the
founders edition model is plagued by
gratuitous heat and noise so as usual
it's up to ad and board partners like
EVGA to optimize the overall experience
especially when it comes to thermal and
acoustics despite my rooms warm ambient
temperature at the time of 29 degrees
Celsius the GPU hovered between 70 and
75 C under load which isn't half bad
using the default Auto fan curve the
cards noise output was delightfully
minimal as well certainly quiet enough
to go unnoticed in a conventional close
chassis but that said here's a sound
test on my open air test bed
before we dive into the benchmarks
here's a look at the overclock settings
I was able to pull off if they don't
look too impressive keep in mind that
the for the win 3 already comes with the
heavy factory OC in the end the card
managed an average core clock speed of
nineteen hundred and thirty six
megahertz and a memory clock of fourteen
hundred and fifty one today's tests were
ran with an Intel Core i5 7600 k
overclocked to four point eight
gigahertz on liquid on an msi z 270
gaming Pro carbon with 16 gigs of G
scale Trident Z ddr4 at 3200 our boot
drive is the one terabyte Toshiba OC zrd
400 m2 nvme SSD loaded with the latest
Windows 10 updates and NVIDIA wickel
drivers on that notes ladies and
gentlemen let's remind ourselves once
again how frigging fast the GTX 1080p is
with some 1440p and 4k benchmarks
it really comes as no surprise that this
card is blazing fast and managed to
deliver over 60 FPS on average at 4k in
every game we tested Ultra HD and ultra
wide gamers can expect even better
performance around the 100 FPS mark
which is just crazy oddly enough we did
encounter some underwhelming frame times
though particularly the 1% in 0.1 % lows
in battlefield 1 and the point 1% lows
in Metro last light
after several retest these results were
repeatable and I'm not exactly sure why
they scored on the low-end like they did
that said before the win 3 crushed every
other title and performed right on par
with my overclocked Asus Strix GTX 1080p
I at 780 USD this is currently one of
the priciest t eyes on the market making
it a tough sell when you think about it
when you consider EVGA zone gtx 1080p is
see also ships with icx technology for
60 bucks less the main difference being
the lower factory overclock and smaller
to fan cooler if money is no object
however the for the win 3 is a cool and
quiet monster that will destroy every
game you own and look fabulous while
doing it but that's going to do it for
now guys let me know in the comments
which gtx 980ti you would prefer and why
does it have a specific set of features
that you like or does it just look super
badass let me know also before you go
