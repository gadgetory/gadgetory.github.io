alright so I tweeted this a couple days
ago worth buying a ps4 for absolutely
love the first one how does this one
hold up talking about Red Dead
Redemption 2 and like over 200 replies
basically going back and forth between
ps4 versus Xbox one which is the better
console to get everyone's got an opinion
of course and while I did see very
compelling arguments on both sides
apparently the Xbox one X is the only
console right now that supports native
4k at 30fps for this title and that kind
of turns me out I think the strongest
argument for the ps4 that I've seen have
been the exclusive titles now when it
comes to gaming and me I probably play
one game a year and right now Red Dead
Redemption is the only title I'm
interested in let alone have time for
but if it really comes to the point
where I absolutely have to play an
exclusive title on ps4 later down the
line then I might just buy that console
too the other thing I was thinking is
that it's been years and years and years
since I've actually gamed on a game pad
a controller and after a bit of research
I discovered a well-known and highly
reviewed product that allows you to use
a keyboard and mouse more seamlessly
with an Xbox one this is the xim apex
keyboard and mouse adapter it's a 130
125 geez it's expensive but I already
bought one just because whatever company
card and while you can't already use a
keyboard and mouse on an Xbox one
without this product this basically
gives users more control and added
support so you can do things like
download game specific profiles to
ensure greater keyboard and mouse
compatibility I also discovered there's
a whole community of people who use
these xim products and basically discuss
you know on the forum pages just exactly
how well certain games are supported and
being the super hot game that it is
right now of course there's a Red Dead
Redemption 2 thread already going and
apparently there is not yet a solid
keyboard and mouse profile for this game
although there is one in the works by
one of the guys missed for fun I believe
who is well known within the community
for for producing and creating these
really really functional profiles so
even though I'll be picking up the X I
am apex later to
I may not be able to get the keyboard
and mouse functionality working just
where I want it to be it'll probably
fall short of a full PC experience but
at the very least I'll have all the main
ingredients ready so by the time that
profile finally hits I should be able to
have somewhat of a PC like experience
with Red Dead Redemption too now like I
said this is already on its way so I
have to pick it up later today at an
Amazon locker center but in the meantime
let's go get ourselves an Xbox 1x what'd
you say why the sauce what'd you say
yeah wifey sauce the kind of girl who
buys her own line for lunch for the
pizzoli
hmm you said listen it's a good line
lots of juice in the caboose that's
gonna be zingy it's just me yours a
little chilly in here big news
funnier joke kale
hold your applause till the end please
you know I was thinking about creating a
new YouTube channel about potatoes but
I'm afraid of all the taters I was gonna
do a little food experiment here just to
smigiel I'm stirred up oh yeah that's
good hey where are the potato salads a
little wine who was standing up in the
movie theater
citrus down it don't boo me it takes
guts to get up here okay or I was just
never funny to begin with and you were
just fake laughing the whole time this
conversations gotten really depressing
for me can whyphy sauce did you know
that this potato salad is non-dairy I
bet the cow farmers are feeling utter
defeat right now did you get that one
and now we can get an Xbox one next
Walmart or Target which one no hi do you
have any Xbox one X units in stock hello
hello
hello the hell's going on meet a call
but that's gonna make a difference you
are luckier than me let me try one more
time hi can you hear me awesome I was
wondering if you have an Xbox 1x
currently in stock what you do and they
don't play the music for you on hold
why this house has to take a call I'm
kicking her out of the car
you guys come first until worse than
that a fully grown wifey sauce in her
natural habitat on the phone okay
there's there's no way you can hold it
for me if I'm if I pop over there right
now is there okay well then I'll just
I'll just haul ass over there right now
then all right thanks man
all right dude have teammates to see
targets yachting in and in in hey I was
wondering do you guys have the Xbox one
next oh that one yeah
our out the game's downloading slowly
but surely we're about halfway done and
it looks like our xim apex just got
delivered to the amazon store I'm
actually kind of excited because this is
an amazon brick-and-mortar store first
of its kind in this area it's actually
near the UCI campus or the University of
California Irvine so I'm kind of stoked
let's go check it out it's like it's a
sort of a DIY thing that's me all right
it's downloaded friggin finally we are
ready to rock this is literally all
that's included with the sim apex yes
I've been calling it xim apex this whole
video and I watch the tutorial video
it's apparently said now I feel stupid
see the little business card with URL
Tong you how to get started the USB hub
this is literally just a sim branded USB
2.0 hub you could even use your own if
you wanted to days they'd they advise
not to use USB 3 it's got three ports
one for your keyboard one for your mouse
and one for your controller and here's
the actual controller that makes the
magic happen so you plug your
peripherals into the hub than your hub
into the stick and then the stick into
your console so here she is how it sort
of looks when it's all set up I'm a purr
if Schenectady I've got the corsair k70
RGB platinum and the corsair m65 pro RGB
knows it may Peck supports a lot of
different kinds of mice and keyboards
the chances are yours is probably
supported too but they do have a full
compatibility list on their website now
this is far from a plug-and-play
solution as soon as you plug this in
your keyboard and mouse are not going to
work right away
you actually have to download the sim
apex manager app which supports iOS and
Android and that's where you'll find
download and apply all these various
game profiles now they call these
profiles st's or smart translators and
every game needs its own one because
every game has a different look
mechanism for example and I did see one
for Red Dead Redemption 2 so it looks
like there's one for first person and
this one might just be for a third
person and look at Xbox one right there
ooh I'm getting kind of excited now
let's check this out requires your game
sensitivity to be set to maximum your
game may also need additional settings
change to ensure optimal any performance
view latest game settings information
now yes okay so it looks like for
certain games you actually have to input
some settings manually for the
configuration or the profile to work as
it should and there's even different
profiles and settings you have to set
for a third person and first-person
perspectives for example because each of
these have their own look mechanisms so
let me punch these in really quick
alright so after you've set your profile
within the manager app you can actually
check out all your P bindings and you
can even edit these if you want so you
can press like cover and when it says
listening I want it to be n so press n
and now it's in but I don't like that
I'm gonna change you back to G you can
change your aim sensitivity here for
firing at the hip or abs or aim down
sights for games that have it alright
the moment we've been waiting for let's
see how this thing game surprises the
beginning of the game creating much and
it looks like we're about to get into a
firefight so I can talk about combat in
a moment but first impressions so far
keyboard and mouse have very low latency
there's hardly any lag it's very
responsive keyboard is working almost
flawlessly from what I can tell but the
the mouse the issue with the mouse is
the sensitivity now you can adjust the
sensitivity with your your actual mouse
and within the game as well as within
the manager app and I'm done all I've
pretty much configured it the best I can
but there's still an issue with the
in-game turn speed there's a maximum
turn speed apparently that the console
games have that literally limit the
speed at which you can turn so if you're
like doing a flick of the wrist it still
takes me like 1 2 3 4 full wrist flicks
for lack of a better term in order to
turn 180 degrees which is way too
sluggish for most people all right let's
do this keep the Wolves from Xavier
being good test oh jeez oh jeez
oh come on reload Daniel oh jeez sweet
killing those wolves was surprisingly
easy but actually getting that third one
having to do the 180 turn was a royal
bitch because of that turn speed
limitation so when you're actually when
your targets are closely grouped
together and you don't have to move a
great distance between them the
sensitivity is fine but you notice the
tremendous slow down when ya
we try to do some longer turns then it
really pulls you out of the game I would
say it's tolerable at best but I feel
like that's really gonna bite you in the
ass if you're trying to play multiplayer
eventually when that when that finally
comes out so I think at this point I
would rather just play this game with
with a gamepad and probably just get
used to that experience and wait for
maybe a better profile to come along if
if there can be one to be honest I'm not
sure if a profile will be able to get
past the turn speed limitation in this
game that seems to be an unsolved
mystery for now so there you have it
guys this is my little journey trying to
get Red Dead Redemption 2 to play like a
PC in the end I felt kind of short but
you know what it was a fun learning
experience and hopefully you guys got
something out of it let me know in the
comments if you guys liked what you saw
today and maybe I'll do a part two
follow-up video assuming I can get this
pesky Mouse to work properly in this
game till next time though toss alike on
the video if you enjoyed it get
subscribe for more tech content on the
way and i'll see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
