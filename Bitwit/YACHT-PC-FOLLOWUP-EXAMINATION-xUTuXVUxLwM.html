in the description below what's going on
guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well so a few weeks
back Austin Evans and I were challenged
by fractal Josh of fractal design North
America to assemble a thread Ripper
gaming system on a speeding yacht that
was going about 40 knots I have no idea
how fast that is but it felt really fast
and this is the monstrosity that Austin
and I came up with it's somewhat of a
finished PC you can see that there's
certain things missing or certain things
not not in their proper place well we'll
talk about all of our mistakes in just a
bit
but we didn't have any peripherals on
the yacht so we were unable to verify
whether or not the system cleared post
it did boot it did power on LEDs turned
on and that sort of thing but we didn't
have a monitor connected to however some
of you guys might have spotted in that
video which you should check out by the
way if you haven't yet it's hilarious
that the post and there was a post error
code on the actual digital readout on
our rog zenith extreme motherboard here
which indicated that the system did not
post so now that we're here in the
studio i have a connected monitor we can
completely verify whether or not the
system actually runs so without further
ado i think this is a good place to
start let's just go ahead and try to
turn the system on there is a surface
mounted power reset button which is good
because austin and i did not connect the
front panel connectors haha and there it
goes oh it just turned off hopefully
it'll turn back on eh so fans are
spinning or I should say fan fan is
spinning hey one out of four ain't bad
up there it is code code zero e check
CPU there's something funky going on
here since yesterday this motherboard
has spit out four different post code
errors completely different and
completely unrelated seemingly and to
the point where I just don't even know
where to start troubleshooting this
thing but that's
the first time I've seen 0e or oay I
can't really tell if it's a zero or no
but it did give me code 92 which was
said nvram test nvram so maybe something
with the memory and then there was
another one that was just said postcode
error and that was 0d so literally three
or four post codes within the last 24
hours if this thing is spit out clearly
either Austin and I royally messed the
system up as everyone would expect or
there's something a little buggy about
our x3 99 motherboard and there have
been numerous reports online that x3 99
ad in its current state is not
performing up to snuff there's certain
bug certain issues with the BIOS and etc
that are causing it to just act out and
I noticed a lot of users in the forum's
have been hit with the same postcode
errors that I am right now the only
difference is they didn't build their
system on a yacht so I'm not exactly
sure where to go from here here's what
I'm thinking I'm gonna take this system
apart and reassemble it outside of the
case so we can essentially attempt an
external test boot and see if that does
the trick and while I go about
uninstalling all of these parts we can
detail every little mistake that Austin
and I made when trying to assemble this
system so why don't we go ahead and
start there I'm gonna go ahead and
switch camera angles so we can start
tearing this guy apart all right so
first off you'll have to forgive the
tripod that's here it was the easiest
way I could get an overhead shot of the
system to show you guys what's going on
but before we start taking things apart
you can already see some of the issues
here I mean we've only got two fans on
this 360 millimetre radiator for the AIO
this fan isn't even mounted it's plugged
in no it's not even plugged in and the
cable is like pinned on something so you
can't just yank it out without
completely breaking the fan so we'll
just leave that there and then also the
case itself is damaged we had to smash
down if you guys watched part one then
you know that Austin I had to smash down
the motherboard tray because the mesh if
I see the way it works is the
motherboard tray is flat and then on the
right side of the motherboard the tray
kind of bows up where the rubber
grommets are for cable routing and stuff
we actually had to push that flush to
make the entire motherboard tray flat in
order to fit the or oh geez you know if
extreme in here which is an E
ix motherboard this case does not
natively support key ATX motherboards
which is something I had overlooked when
bringing all the parts onto that yacht
so that was my bad but hey we got it
installed more or less and because of
that because we smashed down the
motherboard tray it sort of warped the
shape of the case and now the front
panel doesn't sit flush with the rest of
the chassis it kind of just sticks out
no matter what you do and but hey you
know what it's it's just a cosmetic
thing I'm sure the case is still
perfectly functional additionally Austin
and I only managed to get two fans
installed on our 360 radiator for our
Celsius AIO we actually had to remove
the middle fan in order to fit the Strix
GTX 1080i in here again I picked all the
parts for this build and I feel bad I
feel very bad
now just to reiterate this one radiator
fan was the only fan of the entire
system that got plugged in to the
motherboard so the rear exhaust fan does
not spin up nor does the floater fan
here resting on the power supply shroud
the power supply fan spins up
that's because Austin and I never
touched it so it's working just fine but
let's move on shall we starting with the
graphics card I'm going to go ahead and
unplug both of our PCIe cables
fortunately the graphics card didn't
seem to get too banged up all things
considered there's a few light scratches
on the backplate for the most part came
out more or less unscathed
then we've got some power connectors
here our 2014 ATX 8 pin EPS notice how
we routed all these cables through the
basement cover and not the cable routing
holes on the side of the motherboard
because those are completely obscured by
the board itself fun I'm gonna go ahead
and remove the radiator now which was
securely held in place by two screws two
screws are plenty for a large container
that's holding fluid in your computer
now we've got some motherboard screws oh
my god oh my god there's not a single
screw holding this motherboard in place
how is that possible I thought we
installed at least one so apparently the
graphics card which was mounted to the
motherboard and screwed in to the case
with one thumb
was the only thing holding this
motherboard in place I mean apart from
you know the i/o shield if you want to
count that and maybe the the
pre-installed middle standoff
holy moly and this is a big motherboard
- let me get you out of here this
someone's gonna call motherboard
Protective Services on us I might
turn us in I mean we got one two three
four we got four standoffs installed
plus the middle one but I can see why we
didn't get a single screw in because it
still wasn't a hundred percent flush
with the motherboard tray simply because
we had smashed it down you can kind of
see the damage here that we forced upon
this poor chassis good lord well at this
point let me get the freaking power
supply out of here
when we cause any more damage there's
loose rattling screws in here what's
going on
I have never abused hardware to this
degree this isn't Who I am guys it's not
me power supply seems okay I think now
as far as the drive we did have a single
m2 SSD installed right underneath this
little plate here let me get a little
screwdriver our chipset cover slash
heatsink this did sustain some nasty
scratches most likely from the graphics
card but what can you do okie-dokie
oh my god who installed the often I
think Austin installed the m2 SSD he
forgot to remove the the plastic that
goes right on top of the thermal pad but
that's okay because the system didn't
boot anyway but now we can toss this
aside at least it kept the thermal pad
nice and clean I honestly can't blame
Austin though there was so much crap
going on in that yacht that I mean I was
messing things up left and right so I
completely understand if a tiny detail
like that gets overlooked let me go
ahead and put this board on a wax
biggity-boom now while we're here why
don't we just plug in this guy all
righty
we are a go for a test boot cross your
fingers everybody let's hope this goes
well don't explode please up are we in
an infinite boot cycle it looks like we
are
at all right you know what I'm gonna try
swapping out the graphics card so here
we've got a GTX 10 fitted TI stick this
little guy in here doesn't require any
additional power than what it gets from
the PCIe slot and boot up it looks like
we're getting that same post code error
zero D or OD this board is clearly
OD'ing on something now there were no
post codes listed in the manual so I'm
not exactly sure what that is indicating
it's got the little harddrive symbol
next to it but again the only drive we
have in here is a single m2 why don't we
go ahead and remove the m2 drive and see
what happens so it's cycling through all
the different components and when it
gets to hard drive it spits out the zero
D error so it could be a weird BIOS
thing that forces you to connect a SATA
drive or something like that let's see
if this does anything at all but you can
kind of see what I'm talking about here
something's a little off because when we
had the Strix gtx 980ti installed it was
just in an endless boot cycle and as
soon as we swapped it out for a
different card all of a sudden now we're
getting a hard drive post code error so
I don't even know if the motherboard
knows what's wrong same error zero D now
you know what's unfortunate is that I
don't actually have another X 399
motherboard on hand right now so I can't
even verify if if it's the motherboard
or not but we can check the CPU or we
did we did apply thermal paste and all
that let me get a torque screw oh what's
this this seems a little bit loose this
screw was not a hundred percent screwed
wait neither was this one huh these
weren't screwed in all the way oh my god
I installed the CPU so this is all me I
suck Wow I wonder if that was it that's
got to be it right because I mean if the
if the pins aren't making contact with
the contacts then we've got issues ok
let's try this one last time shall we
here we go people moment of truth
there it is again code zero D post error
next to a little harddrive symbol the
hard drive that's not even connected so
I am sort of at a loss here I feel like
I've kind of hit a roadblock and there's
no further troubleshooting I can
actually do until I get another x3 99
motherboard in here I can't even get
into the BIOS guys like splash screen
nothing so I'm gonna have to call it for
this video for now I will say this that
I don't think that this is an issue that
Austin and I caused I think there's some
serious bug with either the motherboard
or the BIOS or the the firmware or
something going on maybe it's a
conspiracy in asus is trying to kill us
all that's obviously what's going on
here but I got a man up and admit that I
was unable to get this system to post
properly and fractal Josh if you're
watching this Austin Evans owes you
lunch with that said guys let me know
what you think if you have any other
grand ideas of how I could get this
system to post let me know in the
comments and feel free to toss me a like
on the video if you enjoyed it until
next time thank you guys so much for
watching be sure to subscribe for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon and
I will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
