what's up guys welcome back to the
channel today I'm checking out a good
old fashioned air CPU cooler that piqued
my interest last week for potentially
solving a recent dilemma of mine you see
currently I'm in the midst of planning a
white themed PC and while white
components are a dime a dozen these days
there seems to be a dearth of white CPU
coolers out there now there's certainly
nothing wrong with the traditional bare
aluminum heatsink with folks looking to
tie in a strong white beam with their
rigs might crave something with a little
more Flair
behold the ETS t40 fit white cluster
edition from enter max this holy grail
of white coolers comes with dual white
fans and an aluminum heatsink that's
been treated with thermal conductive
white paint as to not impede any
effective heat transfer as a part of
enter Max's fit series the cooler boasts
a 180 watt TDP support for all of
today's relevant sockets and a slim
heatsink which guarantees a hundred
percent RAM clearance with both fans
installed if you've never tried to mount
a CPU cooler only to realize that your
RAM was blocking any chance of a proper
installation it's like barely making it
to the bathroom and then realizing
you're out of toilet paper only
difference with the cooler is you can't
use your hands to fix the problem let's
just leave with that the entire cooler
with both fans attached measures ninety
five point eight millimeters wide 126
millimeters long and 161 point seven
millimeters tall enter max brings back
their patented fin design to the fit
series to increase air convection and
air flow by poking little holes in the
heatsink or something check out their
video to learn more about enter max
patents and why having a college intern
do your marketing videos is always a bad
idea
running through the heatsink are four
six millimeter copper heat pipes which
are also coated in that white thermal
conductive paint while making direct
contact with the CPU at the base plate
included are two 120 millimeter twister
bearing pwm fans and even their four pin
cables are bound in a sexy white
sleeving
I think I just touched the camera from
my seat the fans also Sport 9 removable
batwing blades for easy cleaning a
carved out frame that allegedly promotes
additional airflow and a three
while speed adjustments switch on the
back for peak speeds of 1500 1800 and
2200 rpm running with the all-white
theme the fans also sports some bright
white LEDs and a dedicated on/off switch
you know in case accent lighting is
where you draw the line when it comes to
color coordinating installing the cooler
on socket LGA 2011 - 3 was so easy I
gave up on the battlefront beta first
come out the cooler screw in the 4
things with the 2 metal things then 4
more things and put the long thing over
the thing and screw those things in the
manual is not quite as thorough as that
but it's safe to say this was one of the
least painful installations I've done in
a while mounting the fans consists of
screwing in the brackets applying the
vibration pads and clipping them to the
heatsink tossing in some extra vibration
pads would have been nice though since
the one fan that comes pre mounted with
the brackets has the pads covering the
screws which would need to be removed if
you wish to change the orientation of
the fan for optimal cable placement with
the cooler mounted snugly on my
overclocked 5820k I booted up Windows
8.1 and Ransom load testing in GTA 5 at
the fans 3 varying rpm speeds to see
where we land on the acoustics and
thermal scale with that said let's take
a look and a listen at the results
as you can evidently hear the acoustic
differences between idling 1500 and 1800
rpm were almost indistinguishable on my
open-air testbed from 2 feet away
meaning it's wildly unlikely that you'll
be able to hear the fans ramping up and
down inside of an enclosed chassis 1800
rpm kept our CPU nice and cool under
load at 53 degrees Celsius on average
and oddly enough we saw slightly warmer
temps when jumping to 2200 rpm this also
introduced significantly more fan noise
to the system which is far too loud for
most users so I would recommend staying
away from the speed setting altogether
overall this is a nice little air cooler
that not only looks great for your next
white build but performs well to things
like high TDP Ram clearance and seamless
installation are all welcome features
and for about 45 bucks these new fit
coolers from NR max are an easy
recommendation but that is all for now
guys stay tuned in the coming weeks if
you want to see this cooler all dressed
up in my fancy pants white build and
I'll also be checking out a pair of
these AKG headphones and portable amp
deck from sea entrance which you can
grab right now on master up while the
drop is still dropping</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
