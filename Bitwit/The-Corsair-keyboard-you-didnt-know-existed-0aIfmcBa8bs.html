the link in the description below for
more info what's going on guys welcome
back to the channel hope you're all
doing well so we are currently at the
tail end of our holiday season here in
the US which means about a month ago
vendors started sending us reviewers
care packages and Christmas gifts filled
with cookies and candies and warm fuzzy
cards this was all an attempt of course
to buy us off for positive reviews and
to inevitably become their corporate
shills and this is how it works in the
real world in case you didn't know guys
all of my reviews of a company's product
are determined by how good their
Christmas gift was the year prior but of
course this is a small detail that
doesn't warrant any further discussion
anyway
when a large package from Corsair showed
up on our doorstep unannounced our first
thought was what kind of cookies did
they get us this year are we sticking
with Chips Ahoy
did they upgrade us to Oreos dare I say
Nutter Butter that would be a Christmas
miracle but no what they sent us instead
was far cooler ladies and gentlemen this
is the k70 RGB se rapid fire now this is
basically the same rapid-fire keyboard
that launched last year but with a few
aesthetic changes for one we have white
key caps and a silver aluminum frame I
have never seen this keyboard before my
life until now I looked on Amazon and
Newegg both in the US euro and Canadian
websites and I did not find any trace of
this exact model upon further inspection
however I did notice that there was some
Chinese writing right on the retail box
which cues me in to believe that this is
not available in any of those countries
but rather way far east overseas in Asia
so this is a fairly special product and
since I've never given a proper review
of the black k70 rapid fire that
launched last year I figured I would
take a closer look at this one right now
does that work for you good I don't
getting some angry there's nothing to be
angry about
alright let's crack this baby open let's
see what she's made of terror manure
whoo-wee oh oh that
Nass I lock it in why I really do I
think the white looks spectacular of
course I like the black one just as good
blacks just just equal their equal
taking it out of the box but you've got
a large braided K oh sorry hit the mic
fair holy moly I'm all over the place
put yourself together Kyle go home
you're drunk get your plastic wrap I'll
be free no now run well here she is lay
it out spread eagle and all and holy
moley these keycaps are sexy I believe
these are double shots
PBT thick walls thick walls man these
are thicker than even the k95 RGB
platinum which is Corsairs flagship
model far more expensive than the
equivalent k70 rapid fire in the US but
yet these key caps are much sturdier
that is legit ease the ledgers are nice
and big very easy to read whether or not
you like the actual font that they've
used is gonna depend largely on your
personal tastes I don't mind it I do
wish however that they hadn't sandwiched
or squeezed in the special characters
into the same row as their primary
characters I'd rather see them utilize
the empty space on the key cap for those
symbols like they do with the k95 RGB
platinum I think it just looks a little
bit cleaner less cluttered and a bit
more legible as well but of course this
is a minor gripe the other benefit to
having large Ledger's is that you allow
a lot of backlight to bleed through and
of course we have perky RGB lighting
across the entire board which is
fantastic that's all configurable within
the cue software along with any macros
or key reassignments that you can
possibly imagine the cue software has
gotten a lot better over the years
there's still some quirks to it but it's
definitely a lot more intuitive than it
used to be when it first came out well
let's not detract from the real star of
the show that would be a dick move of
course I'm talking about the genuine
Cherry MX speed switches with a linear
travel 45 gram actuation force and one
point two millimeter actuation point
which means that you only have to
depress the key one point two
millimeters before it registers a
keystroke that last spec in particular
is what makes these switches the fastest
ones available on the market the only
ones that could match it as far as I
know are the Razer yellow switches which
also have the same one point two
millimeter actuation point now most of
the other popular mechanical switches
out there have an actuation point of
around
two millimeters which may take a
fraction of a second longer to register
than the switches we have here but when
you're in the grips of an intense
firefight a few milliseconds could mean
the difference between life or death
which is why a lot of gamers gravitate
towards these MX speed switches for that
slight but sometimes significant
competitive edge other bells and
whistles on the rapid-fire include 100%
anti-ghosting and full NP rollover so
you can literally mash down on every
single key at once and every keystroke
will be successfully registered without
a hitch we got a lot going on in the top
right corner of the keyboard including a
four step LED brightness button you can
go off low medium or high next to that
is your Windows key lock button so you
don't accidentally bring yourself out of
game we have some LED indicators for
things like caps lock num lock and your
multimedia keys with a very nice solid
failing volume scroll wheel moving on to
the back here we get a USB 2.0
pass-through port I think it's about
time that we see USB 3 on a future
revision keyboard from Corsair just
sayin and then we also have a polling
rate switch so you can choose between 1
2 4 and 8 milliseconds for your polling
rate if you switch it to the far right
that enables BIOS compatibility mode so
you can ensure this keyboard will work
within the UEFI here we get a super
thick braided cable that looks to be
about 6 or 7 feet that terminates the 2
USB type a ports one for your keyboard
the other for that USB 2.0 pass-through
moving on to the bottom yes we have what
looks to be four small rubber feet so
you don't slip and slide around while
you're typing and four fold-out feet if
you wanted to put this guy on an incline
just to elevate it a little bit makes it
a bit more ergonomic for some folks when
typing however these fold-out feet do
not have any rubber feet ease on them
there are no rubber boots so this is
gonna be sliding around like crazy
unless you fold these feet in work
that's kind of a shame because I do like
that implant but that's purnam what
should I think we covered all that
really quickly super efficient this
review as far as pricing as I mentioned
before I don't know how much this costs
in China or wherever the hell they sell
it all I know is that it retails for a
hundred and twenty bucks on Amazon
currently here in the United States the
picture on Amazon also reminded me that
the US version comes with the wrist rest
whereas this one does not
I mean how spoiled are we you give an
American 120 dollar keyboard what's his
response but my whisper
with her when you wish brassware anyway
cool keyboard honestly it puts a pretty
sweet spin on an already great product
so I'm 100% for it additionally I'll say
if you're planning to use a keyboard
with white key caps just be aware that
you're gonna get it dirty real quick at
the same time using a keyboard like this
one in a country where you're
technically not supposed to anda makes
it all worth it
but that's all I got for now guys so if
you enjoyed this video feel free to toss
me a look before you go it helps me a
lot and also subscribe to the channel
for more tech stuff coming at you really
soon additionally if you'd like to see
videos like this up to a week early
