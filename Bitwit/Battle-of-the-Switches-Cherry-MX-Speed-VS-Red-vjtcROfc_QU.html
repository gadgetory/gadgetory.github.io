channel today I have something a little
bit special for you guys planned we're
going to switch things up instead of
doing a typical review wifey sauce and I
are going to do a little bit of an
experiment with the Corsair k70 rapid
fire so the rapid fire keyboard is now
featuring the very very fast Cherry MX
speed switches which had the same
actuation force voice of 45 grams as the
Cherry MX red switches
however they have a much shorter
actuation distance at one point two
millimeters as opposed to two
millimeters on the Reds so allegedly
Corsair is claiming that the MX beat
switches are up to 40% faster than the
Cherry MX Reds whyphy sauce and I are
going to go through a series of tests to
see if that's really the case
now obviously you should take these
tests with a grain of salt unless we had
like a high-speed camera we wouldn't
really be able to pinpoint you know the
accuracy on exactly how fast these
switches are but we're going to do our
best with a series of fun little tests
this is more just for shits and giggles
aw shoot I should I should thank you for
putting up with me on camera so okay so
first off what we're gonna do is I have
a little game setup here this is not I
guess I guess if you want to call it a
game it's called press the spacebar mm
it's a really simple game where you pick
a time slot a time period and within
that time frame whichever one you choose
you basically have to mash the spacebar
as many times as possible so what I'm
gonna do here is I'm we're gonna do the
five-second interval starting with you
okay um since you have that will do the
Cherry MX red switches first and you're
just gonna mash it now we're gonna do a
roll here alright so you can actually
use two fingers at a time you can't use
two hands but oh we're gonna allow two
fingers so you can alternate like so
obviously use the hand that you're
faster with and yeah just finger the
 out of the thing all right so what
we're gonna do this we're gonna do this
three times we're gonna do this three
times per person just to get an average
because you might one one run of yours
might be faster than the other so we're
gonna do three runs with you right now
and then we'll take it from there are
you ready for this yep all right as fast
as you can three two one go
that's pretty bad yeah I could just I
could hear the slowness yes all right
let's see I don't play video games Hey
this is nothing okay 56 isn't bad that's
not too shabby okay so I'm gonna write
that down 56 was your first go remember
you have two more attempts here all
right and when you're ready well hi this
it's a good thing you don't play this
competitively 59 that was actually
faster than your last one which is
amazing last run take your time
well don't take your time but take your
time getting ready please
starting to get some finger fatigue
there yes yeah you should try these on X
speed switches oh no fatigue here what
was my result for that one oh let's see
57 all right so we've got a pretty
decent average here looks like 58 well
58 see ravage 56:59 57 uh no wait your
average is 50 7.3 we'll just call it 57
switch keyboards alrighty now you're
gonna be using the speed switches I need
my space ball you are gonna need the
space bar right now she has no space bar
on on the the rapid-fire keyboard
because the reason why I took that one
off is because that's one of the slight
changes with the rapid-fire
over the standard k70 RGB is that the
space bars are a little different the
one on the the rapid-fire actually is a
little bit textured whereas you get a
smooth space bar on the RGB so just to
keep things very consistent I music
we're using the same exact space bar
found on the k70 RGB I'm slapping this
right onto the rapid-fire
and it's already that's already started
damn it okay boom boom boom alright now
she's gone with the speed switch is when
you're ready honey
hmmm maybe maybe a little faster I can't
tell who he sent that at the end yeah
little bit 59 okay same I wouldn't be
surprised if there's no change at all
here but let's let's see we've got two
more runs I feel like you could do
faster than that let's see because I
feel like you slipped the lid on the end
yep go for it wasn't bad let's take a
look
54 yikes horrible I think you're folding
under pressure this is my sixth time
doing it it's also your sixth time we
should have alternated dammit well oh
well test can't be perfect I know we'll
be here all night if we try to cross
every T okay um one last time round
three round six technically alright
62 that's actually your your highest run
so far out of all of them out of all six
so let's see you got 59 your average
there was 58 you got it you got a whole
space bar extra in there one one higher
keystroke faster with the MX speed
switches confirmed I'm so let's just
let's just end the video now that proves
it that this is a faster keyboard this
has been scientifically deduced now you
can I can score mine
what am I start I'm starting off with
the Reds just like you did alright baby
oh wait I need spacebar stop hogging the
spacebar running out of space over here
ready why am I asking you alright here
we go
ah he's gotta like he's gotta pretend
like you're ragequitting 71 holy smokes
polish Marcus and and there is someone
in the comments might even say this I
might mention this but I've been using
the k70 RGB for pretty much since it
came out so I might have worn in these
switches a little bit more as opposed to
the rapid-fire which is brand new out of
the box so that might have some kind of
bearing on the results here just keep
that in mind again we're not being too
precise here all right round two okay
man when you're when you're going that
fast
five seconds feels like forever 71 again
71 again it's hard to see a trend I'll
be your average I am consistent last
round with the MX red switches alright I
need I need complete and total silence
you can't fudge the results like that
bro brah 73 haha alright so let's call
it 71 is still probably my average let's
let's go ahead and see how I fare with
the MX speed switches now okay let's see
if I get 40% more space bars ready ready
and go oh I had a rough start there
rough start 72 Wow I'm see this is this
is pretty yeah
pretty marginal stuff here round two but
the MX feeds Oh No
I faltered at the end or I failed 67 oh
that was clearly user error I'm not
gonna blame the switches on that one
no pressure Kyle no pressure alright
final ramp
Oh No let's see I tapped out at the end
7g alright so that's probably what was
my first one
69 hey got my favorite number in there
but that is - spacebar slower then then
with the MX Reds obviously I mean take
take this with a grain of salt as I
mentioned before take this test for what
you for what it's worth but but that's
not all we have one more test to run
through before we call this a day and
that is this stupid sumo game that I
found so this is a two-player flash game
that relies on just a single button
mashing repeatedly and I should mention
that with the cherry MMX with the chair
make speed switches you they actually
don't require as much distance or time
to when you bottomed out to go back up
so you can actually actuate it can
actually actuate a lot sooner than you
could theoretically with the Cherry MX
red switches so hopefully that that
should help one of us out here
sumo tool no idea but it looks like I'm
mashing D and you're mashing the left
arrow and that's that's all it is you
just mash it as fast as possible and
whoever mash is quicker faster I will
push the other one outside of the sumo
ring okay
pretty simple are you sure that I'm the
arrow yes yes you are
and I'm D okay like as in the D okay
I'll just go ahead and mash it yeah I
know but I've got a I've got a I've got
a solution to that that problem okay so
I I beat you there I beat you when I
want to do this in post when I put this
in post-production edit I'll actually
time out how long it takes me to beat
you and then we're going to switch
keyboards and then then I'm going to see
if it takes me any longer or any any
yeah any longer to beat you with the
alleged slower switches okay so we're
not gonna really know the results until
after we're done shooting this video so
that's weird
anyway alright ready go
I will kick your ass you do whoo I'm
horrible so uh feels like what maybe
three or four seconds to to beat you let
me try one more time let's try one more
time I just get slower than what we do
this so do I though okay I'm getting ya
my finger certain to cramp up all right
ready hold it down you go all right no
it's not your cue to go I still need you
now I'm gonna use the slower switches
honey now maybe maybe you won't get beat
as quickly now I'm not gonna go as so
far as to say you're gonna hey no no
that's cheating that's cheating
what the hell okay one all right hold on
all right that's that's not okay you get
a pity win you happy with that does that
make you happy satisfied okay start it
all right uh ready
Wow okay either either I just got much
slower from the Cherry MX red switches
or you just stepped up your game but
that took me a lot longer to beat you
agreed let's let's see if it was a fluke
or not let's do one more time
or two more times I got you I got you ow
oh man my finger I just want to see you
suffer
yeah well that is your favorite pastime
okay I don't wait why is it going what
 here oh god why stop bookmarking
things this isn't even that good of a
game go Howard look Morgan ah yeah okay
okay oh man I hyperventilate alright so
before my arm falls off or my fingers
just completely deteriorate III think
it's safe to say that the Cherry MX
speed switches are at least a bit faster
than something like the cherry MX Reds
and I'm sorry that's a scientific of an
answer we can give you guys today
because this testing like I said has not
been super precise it's more just kind
of one of those for the lols types of
things but I think it was interesting
how it did take me quite a bit longer to
beat you in that sumo game using the
Reds so that that's saying something at
least but guys if you enjoyed this type
of weird video I know I did it's fun we
get to drink wine and dance around and
mash keys and stuff then go ahead let me
know toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it and also if you want to see a
full review on the k70 rapid fire go
ahead and leave me some love let me know
