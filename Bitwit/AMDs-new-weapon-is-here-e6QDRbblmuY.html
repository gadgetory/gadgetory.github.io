graphics card well I shouldn't say it's
actually here the embossing embargo is
here oh what a world we live in so today
I'm just throwing my video into the pile
of other unboxing videos that are
probably blowing up your sub feed right
now and thank you for clicking on mine
February 7th is when the card launches
for 699 US dollars that puts it right up
there with the r-tx 2080 from Nvidia so
let's hope I haven't tested it yet
obviously but let's hope that the
performance is there to match and stay
competitive with an RT X 2080 I didn't
cover this card at all at CES this year
and it was initially debuted but that
doesn't mean I wasn't excited about it
I've been waiting for a long time I
think we all have for NVIDIA to get a
little bit of competition for them to
see just a little bit of competition in
the high end GPU space they've
objectively been dominating the market
for a while now and without really solid
competition in that space ultimately
it's the customers who suffer so I'm
really rooting for the underdog here and
sincerely hoping that this card can
offer gamers a viable alternative to
geforce cards in the high end GPU market
fairly well known at this point that
this is the world's first 7 nanometer
gaming GPU very exciting touring with
the GeForce is 12 nanometer so we're
gonna pop the lid off of this bad boy
hey simple simple and clean I like it
you got a card and plastic thing what is
this looks like a stand a little bigger
the GPU right there that's a big sucker
what is this candy no these are
batteries oh I see these probably go in
here I doubt that the power of the GPU
I'm sure it needs a bit more juice than
that let's take the card out first and
then we'll mess around with this
business go just sad yeah now this GPU
I'm gonna try to do this one-handed
while filling it features 60 compute
units oh this is this is gonna be a
challenge
60 compute units 30 840 shader units oh
my god professional inbox are here so
there's actually fewer units overall
than its predecessor the RX Vegas 64
however we are packing double the frame
buffer with 16 gigs of HBM to memory on
a 4096 bit bus giving us a terabyte of
memory bandwidth and that seven
nanometer architecture has really done
AMD some favors when it comes to
clocking this thing out of the box we're
gonna see peak frequencies of 1800
megahertz that's about 300 megahertz
higher than we saw with the RX Vega
sixty-four and of course the
architecture isn't just about raw power
it's also about power efficiency so at
300 megahertz faster than an Rx Vega 64
it's still drawing around the same
amount of power which is pretty
impressive now this card doesn't have
any RT cores on it like the Turing cards
do but AMD is said that it can handle
ray-tracing workloads just fine and in
some cases even outperform its turning
rivals in particular rate racing
workloads there's also no crossfire
support for this card it's a bit of a
lone wolf in that sense which is fine by
me I mean I would imagine that getting
32 gigs of HBM to memory to work nicely
together it would be a waking nightmare
and plus I usually suggest people go
with a single faster card anyway as
opposed to doing a multi GPU set up for
reliability stability and performance
taking a closer look at the card you've
still got your tried-and-true PCIe gen3
here and it looks like a very sort of
simplified and minimalistic design here
it's like they took a piece of sheet
metal vented a couple times cut out a
couple holes and bam there's your
reference design GPU you got three fans
they look to be about ninety two
millimeters or so and the heatsink this
portion of the heatsink is actually much
taller than the portion you're seeing
underneath the fans so it does provide a
little extra heat dissipation you can
see that there's a copper plate right
there and it's a fairly open shroud
nothing is getting ejected out the front
if you want to call this the front of
the GPU but certainly air is gonna be
exhausted out the bottom the top to some
degree and certainly the back so be sure
to plan your airflow path accordingly
should you be popping one of these into
a future bill while we're at the rear
here let's take a look at our IO we've
got one HDMI and three display ports
Radeon branding of course this is very
similar to the RX Vegas 64 this probably
lights up red not expecting any RGB here
you've also got that Radeon cube in the
corner that I'm sure lights up to just
above that dual eight pin power plugs
again 295 watt TDP and very curious to
see exactly how much power this will
draw from the wall though and of course
I can't talk about that right now the
back it looks very nice kind of the same
sort of color machining as the front all
very uniform I wonder if this adds any
sort of thermal dissipation definitely
has a lot of slots for ventilation but
it looks like it's fairly close to the
PCB there yeah it's like right on it I'd
be curious to tear this thing apart and
check to see if there's any thermal pad
situation nor if this is actually being
used as a heatsink of some sort the card
is not super tall or anything
maybe extends 3/4 of an inch over the L
shape of the of the PCI bracket there
and it measures about 12 inches long
that's 305 millimeters for those of you
who live in a place where things make
sense I've been feeling it this whole
video but I haven't pointed it out till
now this card is very heavy I mean
between the back plate and the full
length heat sink just the shroud itself
being all metal this thing is friggin
brick this might be a good card to
vertical mount honestly assuming that
you can get it far away enough from the
side panel okay it's time to bust this
thing out first things first you put the
bird or is in these crappy batteries
give me a sec so this has now become a
battery unboxing video these are triple
A's comes in a pack of three get in the
thing I just have one day without
problems is that too much to ask yes
batteries installed ok GPU I don't know
how this goes probably like that does
that look right sure and there's a power
switch back here somewhere
aha oh this is really illuminate all
that well kind of a weak RGB
implementation let's see if it looks
better with the lights off okay it's
definitely a bit more noticeable now
that's a pretty nice display let me just
set this up here we'll do a little
talkie-talkie
okay look really short right now because
I had to lower my chair so that my head
doesn't get cut off I really need a
haircut getting sidetracked here like I
mentioned this card has to stay
competitive performance wise with an RT
X 2080 in order for people to give a
crap about it otherwise what's the point
you're not gonna pay more money for less
performance that's if you're strictly
talking from a gaming perspective if
you're looking into doing some rate
racing workloads from a professional
standpoint then maybe the 16 gigs of
on-board HBM to memory is enough that's
the beauty of this card is it's sort of
flexible kind of versatile it might be
good for someone who likes to work and
play whereas the RT X 2080 is strictly
marketed towards a gaming audience
hypothetically if I was in the market
for a new high end GPU and I had 700
bucks to drop on one just willy-nilly
personally I would be looking strictly
at raw gaming performance in terms of
frame rates 1% lows 0.1% lows and that
sort of thing for gaming in 2019 16 gigs
of VRAM is absolutely insane it's more
than anyone could possibly utilize and
you know it's it's nice to have but you
don't necessarily need it so I think for
gamers and
it's gonna boil down to how fast this is
compared to NRT X 2080 especially now
that you get free sinc support with ten
series cards and newer on the geforce
side it's one less argument for for
high-end AMD GPUs like this you can't
just say well you might save 200 bucks
300 bucks on a free sync panel instead
of having to go with g-sync well that's
not the case anymore so this thing
really does have to have the performance
to back up the price in relation to the
competition and I really hope it knocks
out of the park you guys let me know
what your anticipations are or your
expectations are sir and what you what
you think of this card so far if you're
hoping that it succeeds if you are an
Nvidia fanboy and you hate competition
and you can't wait to see it fail let me
know down below guys thanks for watching
this quick and dirty video as always
toss a like on it if you enjoyed it and
get subscribed for more tech stuff
coming at you really soon I'm actually
going to drop this on the test bed right
meow so I must stop recording or I will
get in lots of trouble and I will never
get anything like this from AMD ever
again okay I'm rambling now have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
