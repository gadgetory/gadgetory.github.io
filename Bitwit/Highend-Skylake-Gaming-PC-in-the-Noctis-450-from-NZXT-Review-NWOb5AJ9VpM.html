channel hope you're all doing well in
this video I'm going to be checking out
the Noctis 450 from NZXT but unlike most
other case reviews that I do today I'm
also going to be doing a full skylake
system build in this case that's right
you're basically getting two videos but
you only have to tolerate me for half
the time everyone wins
so in just a bit I'll be showing off the
full time-lapse of the assembly while
commentating on my build experience in
this case along the way of course since
most of the build will take place inside
of the chassis let's quickly take a look
at the noctis's unique exterior design
so if he wants back after this case
released in the US the internet wasted
no time in bequeathing it the pseudo
name the dark knight case an alias I
find befitting as the stealthy matte
black finish and wicked sharp edges make
the case look like something you'd find
when snooping around the Batcave there's
also a red glowing NZXT logo on the
power supply shroud and some matching
under glow lighting which make the case
look pretty badass in low-light perhaps
even more badass though would have been
the inclusion of RGB LED functionality
for a far broader range of system
customization instead your only other
color option here for the Noctis is the
white model that features blue accent
lighting which might seem a bit limiting
now while this case uses the same slim
frame as the hugely successful NZXT h4
40 the massive bulge of the 450s
top and front panels make it much
bulkier in comparison so small desk
owners beware fortunately both panels
support a fully open ventilation design
though it would appear otherwise while
their purpose is purely cosmetic all the
plastic paneling is actually raised a
few centimeters above the underlying
mesh to ensure fresh air flow all around
popping off the front panel we see the
omission of a five and a quarter inch
Bay in place of a magnetic dust filter
that hides three included 120 millimeter
fans with optional mounting points for
two 140 s I was also pleased to see
ample space under the front panel for
push-pull setups when water cooling on
top you'll find a pair of USB 2 and USB
3 ports mic and headphone jacks and
power button with red LED under the hood
is the same configuration we saw at the
front with mounting points for three
or to 140s it should be noted here
though that only the two rear fans can
fit directly underneath the top panel
meaning you'd only be able to install
five of the six fans when mounting a 360
radiator in push-pull rounding out the
last of the pre-installed fans you get a
140 millimeter at the back of the case
with vertical mounting strips for
additional radiator clearance you can
also swap out the fan for a 120
millimeter option if you're so inclined
since fishing around the back your case
in the dark is no fun there's a small
button that turns on two blue LEDs to
illuminate your rear i/o the same button
can also be used to toggle the NZXT and
underglow leds on and off additional
mentions include seven expansion slots
two grommets for water cooling tubes and
a removable PSU bracket that mounts
directly to your power supply for a
smooth rear installation there's also a
removable dust filter that slides out
from the bottom for quick and easy
cleaning by the way good on NZXT for
choosing capacitive thumb screws not
only for this bracket but for the side
panels as well the large trapezoidal
window does a nice job at showing off
your main components though I generally
prefer rectangle over Red Solo Cup and
that right there pretty much sums it up
for the exterior of this case so moving
right along let's toss it over to vlog
kyle who will give us an inside look at
building a high-end skylight gaming rig
in the noctus 450 hey hey thanks script
kyle how's it going everyone this is
vlog kyle here
s grip kyle mentioned i am going to be
doing a narrative of this whole build
process from start to finish as we watch
build kyle go ahead and assemble this
skylake system for those of you who are
wondering he's using a core i7 6700 k
with a gaming g1 motherboard from
gigabyte that's on the z170 chipset
along with a quad I'm sorry a dual
channel kit of ddr4 memory from corsair
to their vengeance line of low profile
memory but while he goes ahead and preps
this board on the CPU cooler I'm going
to go ahead and just get right into it
with the noctus 450 I was pretty
impressed by the interior as far as
build quality goes the paint job was
incredible it's got a really smooth
matte black finish that kind of matches
the stealth vibe of the outside of the
case and I thought that was really a
kind of top-notch attention to detail
type feature that really gives a the
case a premium look and feel both inside
and out the motherboard went in no
problem all the standoffs are
pre-installed there's a middle one
that's a little bit taller too
you align the whole thing while this
case doesn't officially support EI TX
the board that you see here is in fact
extended ATX form factor and it was able
to go in no problem shut up phone sorry
about that
but it does cover up some of the
grommets on the right side so just be
prepared to have to route some of the
larger cables like your 24 pin ATX
around the actual motherboard tray
because you won't be able to fit them in
with that e-atx 4 into slightly covering
them the power supply went in no problem
with that rear access mounting bracket
the radiator as well went in no problem
although there's a lot of space between
the radiator and the left side panel I
felt like there could have been more
mounting options to have the radiator
positioned further away from the
motherboard to allow for thicker
radiators or even taller heat spreaders
on your RAM for instance I felt like
that would have been cool I think now
build Kyle has gone on to routing the
front panel connectors they actually go
right through the power supply shroud
and then into the motherboard of course
I do wish that they were grommeted
however I felt like they are visible
from the side panel window I just think
at 140 bucks for this case that grommets
would have been nice to see at the back
of the case we get 5 removable drive
trays which can support either three and
a half or two and a half inch drives
they're made of pure steel they are very
high quality they do not Bend
they're super sturdy and they've got two
little thumb screws to help you remove
and replace them quite easily you can
leave them out if you're not using them
and open up a ton of air flow at the
front for those three 120 millimeter
fans a really great option there you
don't have to deal with any kind of
drive cage they're all just kind of
independent drive trays which I think
simplifies things a lot adds for a bit
more flexibility I would have liked to
see mounting holes on that hard drive
wall however for like a water cooling
reservoir for example I know fantex does
this and I feel like at this price point
that would have been really nice to see
so kind of a mischance there moving on
to the SSD installation you do get two
dedicated SSD mounts right on top of the
power supply shroud they are held in
place with a couple latches as well as a
single thumb screw this is a really nice
place and a really great idea for for
storing your your SSDs especially now
that the designs of SSDs are getting a
lot more fancy or more showy people want
to show them off right they're not ugly
3.5 inch drives so it's kind of a
implementation there all right bailed
Kyle is now going for the video card
we've got a PCS plus from power color
it's an r9 390x and it's ten and a half
inch card it's nice and easy inside of
the Noctis 450 this case actually
supports pretty much as long as you want
as long as the hard drive tray that's
right in that area isn't blocking it you
will have to remove it but yeah you can
go probably the full nearly the full
span length of the case with however big
of a video card you might need just be
aware of the width as you might run into
the that hard drive wall right there and
finally winding down with some cable
management there's just absolutely a ton
of room in front of the power supply to
store all of your cabling as well as a
little bit of space behind the
motherboard tray but like I said most of
it goes in front of your power supply
which is totally fine there are a ton of
tie-down points as well although NZXT
only threw in these really tiny kind of
dinky zip ties I would have really liked
to see velcro straps at this price point
also there's a strange three and a half
inch or two and a half inch drive mount
at the very bottom of the case in front
of the power supply and which I guess is
neat if you need it but I honestly was
kind of hoping for maybe a mount for a
water cooling pump for example but that
would have been really sweet but what
can you do altogether this is a pretty
smooth and straightforward build I
actually liked it I'm sure bill cow
liked it as well but why don't we take
it back over to script Kyle and see how
he liked it so overall there's a lot of
good things to say about the noctus 450
the build quality and paint job is
top-notch inside and out it features a
strong internal layout that makes
building easy and there's enough
well-placed routing holes to achieve a
clean end result which I very much
appreciate the system stays decently
quiet and the fan options when combined
with those removable drive trays make
for some killer airflow at the same time
I was expecting to see a few more
premium features that would justify its
140 dollar price tag simple things like
pump and reservoir mounts and even some
nicer accessories I felt were missed
opportunities this time around while I
think bringing over the h4 40s interior
layout was a smart move
I also wish NZXT would have innovated a
little more in this area as I'm sure
some folks will find that the dark
knight' aesthetic by itself might not
warrant the $30.00 premium over the h4
40 when it comes down to it
perhaps the Noctis 450 is the case you
deserve
but not the case you need right now I
can't do it at any rate so let me know
what you guys think of this case in the
comments and don't forget to test me I
