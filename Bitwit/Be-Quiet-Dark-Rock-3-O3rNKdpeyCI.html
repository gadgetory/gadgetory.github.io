how's it going guys so I recently asked
German manufacturer be quiet if they had
one cool product I could check out for
the channel to which they responded by
immediately sending me a box full of
components that's when I learned the
German word for five is one and honestly
I probably won't get around to reviewing
everything they sent me because ain't
nobody gets half of that I did however
ask you guys on Instagram and Twitter
which component you fancied the most and
was met with a lot of favoritism for
their dark rock 3 CPU cooler so that's
the one I'll be reviewing today I'm
going to be testing it against the more
modest shadow rock slim and I'll also be
running it in a push-pull setup with one
of the quiet silent wings 2 fans to see
how many more degrees we can shave off
of my 59 30k but for now let's have a
closer look at the cooler the dark rogue
3 measures in at 97 millimeters long by
a hundred and thirty seven millimeters
wide by 160 millimeters tall making it a
whiter cooler than most RAM clearance
can pose an issue if the dim slot
nearest to the socket is occupied but
fortunately the fan mounting clips allow
the fan to be moved higher up on the
heatsink I can't tell if these clips are
intended to work this way or if I've
just thought of a brilliant patent idea
that's going to make me millions of
dollars excuse me just bear in mind that
moving the fan to a higher position on
the heatsink increases the overall
height of the tower you can expect
support for any of the widely adopted
AMD and Intel sockets with included
mounting accessories thermal paste and
instructions right on the box we see
this cooler has a 190 watt TDP which
offers great cooling capacity for most
processors with a few exceptions such as
AMD's high-end of a share CPUs which can
reach TDPS of up to 220 watts for
something like the FX 95 90 for instance
I'd recommend something besides the dark
rock 3 like a different processor
working alongside the heatsink as big
quiets very own 135 millimeters silent
wings pwm fan which does have a black
sleeved cable 220 millimeters in length
the fans rated at 1,400 rpm and uses
nine blades lined with the number of
grooves which aim to increase airflow
while maintaining near silent operation
I certainly came to respect
the quietness of this cooler after
nearly losing my finger due to thinking
the fan was off to further aid in
acoustics and the potential for lost
limbs the fan uses a 6-pole motor design
and the heatsink itself is lined with
two long rubberized pads for the fan to
rest up against reducing noise and
vibration while introducing some rubber
in-between things is a great
preventative measure the padding is
nowhere to be found on the other side of
the heatsink which is odd seeing as how
the cooler supports an additional 120
millimeter fan although I do have a
theory explaining this conundrum that
I'll share with you later
the metallic fan clips make installation
a breeze and as I mentioned earlier
facilitate the option for vertical
adjustment also vital to the coolers
performance of course is its heatsink
this one has 51 aluminum fins which are
entirely dark nickel-plated giving them
a near black matte finish heat from the
CPU is effectively carried up through
the thinner a via six six millimeter
copper heat pipes topped at the ends
with aluminum caps a diamond cut finish
Grace's the brushed aluminum top cover
complemented by a subtle yet stylish
touch of be quiet branding at the base
of the cooler is a copper base plate and
looks to be a much smaller heatsink for
additional heat dissipation although
since this little guy didn't bother
making an appearance on the retail box I
can only assume he's a passive heatsink
installing the dark rock 3 on a 2011 - 3
socket proved to be a bit challenging
the 4 threaded posts kept getting
snagged on the non threaded holes of the
mounting bracket which made it difficult
to mount the cooler evenly on the CPU
after enough fiddling tightening the
nuts with the included excuse for a
wrench wasn't much better next time I'd
asked for an easier mounting solution
altogether or at least a wrench with an
angled head that isn't made by
fisher-price now I ran this cooler on
top of my stock 59 30 K and compared it
to two other setups in my testing
including the shadow rock slim being a
budget-friendly option for lower tvp's
and the dark rock 3 itself equipped with
a 120 millimeter silent wings to pwm fan
and here's where I revisit my theory on
why the dark rock 3 only has rubber
padding on one side of its heatsink the
outer rims on both sides of the silent
winks to fan are already lined with
rubberized material so there's really no
need for additional padding on the fin
stack immediately this makes you marvel
at bee quiets brilliant German
engineering right before realising hey
they're forcing me to buy their fans
out that may not be such a bad idea as
the temps they were able to achieve show
great promise the dark rock three stayed
well below eighty and CPU intensive
synthetics and kept things cool when
gaming temps were also knocked down in a
degree or two once the cooler was
configured for push-pull even the shadow
rock slim trailing behind it's bigger
brother by a wider margin saw acceptable
temperatures overall so there you guys
have it clearly this cooler is a great
performer I personally love the brushed
aluminum look in style and so far every
be quiet component I've handled has been
crafted with tip-top quality and design
as it Germans as always guys toss me a

other be quiet products you may have
