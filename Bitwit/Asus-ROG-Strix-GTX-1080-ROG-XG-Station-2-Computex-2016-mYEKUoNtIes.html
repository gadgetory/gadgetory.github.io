Computex 2016 is brought to you by
gigabyte fantex cable mod and g.skill
without them i would still be at home
with more free time click the links in
the description for more info alright
guys I've made my way over here to the
Asus booth they've got a lot of cool
stuff but I really just care about the
video cards for some reason here at
Computex 2016 and this is really
exciting this is there ROG strict gtx
1080
this thing is pretty wicked and it's
gonna be launching later this week so
keep an eye out for it it's pretty
awesome you can see it's got a
completely new really engineered and
redesigned cooler the Strix cooler of
course with the turbo fans it's got
three beautiful fans that go across the
aluminum heatsink they're custom PCB
we've got a single eight pin and a
single 6 pin PCI II connector amazing
looking backplate very nice it's got a
little bit of a ventilation open there
as well now this is actually pretty cool
because if you look at the front here
and I'll punch in on a b-roll shot
there's two four pin pwm fan headers
directly built into the video card and
the reason for that is is because
sometimes you had the fans in your
system your chassis fans configured to
ramp up or down depending on the
temperature of your CPU but if you have
something like a you know a Corsair H
100 ID GTX or whatever or water cold
system on your CPU but sometimes your
graphics cards getting really hot but
your CPU not necessarily and so because
of that your system fans won't wrap up
and give the the proper cooling that
your graphics cards need so it's
actually nice that the you'll actually
have up to two fans that can be
completely dependent on your GPUs
temperature which is nice to see another
cool little addition here and this is
also how you can tell this is a custom
PCB is if you look at the display i/o
we're actually seeing of course your
agora dual link DVI but in addition to
that you've got two DisplayPort and two
HDMI and the reason why issue says
pretty much exit out one of the display
ports and replaced it with HDMI is
because you're gonna be filling up that
HDMI port with that in oculus rift or an
HTC vive anyway which basically leaves
you with no more HDMI outputs on your
video card and since a lot of people are
still using HDMI based monitors Asus
figured it made a lot more sense to have
at least two of them on there instead of
one so altogether a pretty awesome card
again be sure to keep an eye out for it
and I'm gonna go ahead and see what else
is around this booth because there's
there's a lot of cool stuff here
alright guys I've moved about 10 inches
from the video card and now we have the
the ROG X G station - this is
essentially an external graphics card
enclosure the graphics card which is a
GTX 1080 in here right now is sold
separately we're just talking about the
enclosure here and actually saw an
earlier version of this back in CES in
January and it's changed a lot probably
the biggest change and probably the best
change that I found is that it's no
longer using a proprietary connection
which was PCIe before now it's actually
using Thunderbolt 3 I'm a Thunderbolt 3
you're introducing a bit more latency
there's a bit more decode and encode
going on so you're not gonna get quite
the performance out of Thunderbolt 3 as
you are with PCIe however it's going to
be a universal connection that can be
pretty much supported by any laptop with
that TB 3 connector but that being said
there are a lot more cool features to
this as well it's got a bunch of pass
throughs in the back USB 3 as well as
Gigabit Ethernet LAN so you can connect
you know whatever peripherals your
keyboard mouse and of course your
Ethernet cable back there it's also got
kind of a nice little aesthetic
see-through window which is acrylic I
believe and you've also got like a
little bit of a pulsator I don't know
kind of a retro looking thing in the
middle I'm not sure exactly what it is
some kind of core reactor flux capacitor
thing it's pretty wicked though there is
no pricing available for this yet I
asked the guy couldn't get a number out
of him although he did say that asus is
trying to push this in time for the
holiday season this year pretty cool so
asus is also showing off their aura RGB
lighting effects here actually a really
cool function that i can do is if you
have a bunch of ROG components that are
RGB LED compatible with the aura
software you can basically link them all
up and control them through the software
at the same time and not only that you
can see that they're completely sync so
right here we've got an ROG motherboard
a PCIe graphics card you get the LED
strips inside the case keyboard mouse
and even the LEDs on the monitor they
are all in sync actually they're not
quite in sync right now they're they're
actually I think somewhat a 6 rep came
by and like scrambled the settings but I
swear to god they were like perfectly in
sync a second ago this is going horribly
wrong anyway you should just take my
word for it but this feature is awesome
and it does work
back to you me alright guys that is
pretty much gonna wrap it up here for my
coverage of the Asus booth at Computex
