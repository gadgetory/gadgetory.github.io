justice understand I understand now
understand my place okay okay what could
you using the updated interfaces that
even know well they like I didn't opt
for this this is the shit that always
happens on this classic I do this every
time and I always revert me back only on
this laptop okay for some reason this
laptop thinks that I want to see the the
YouTube studio beta or whatever it is
yeah stupid it's terrible hits you it's
absolutely terrible hello hi everyone
starting this stream off with good vibes
welcome to awesome Hardware episode 183
this is side a and about a half an hour
to maybe 40 minutes or so we're gonna
switch over to side B on Paul's channel
OJ's youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware
you can find the link in the description
of my video if you're watching on
youtube I just copy pasted it in there
so it's fresh it's a fresh link super
fresh happy 8th at the April everyone
happy April yes yes absolutely
April Fool's is behind us now so we can
we can all go into the to the month with
a new sense of of trust and confidence
yes though on all those good things but
let's see we we also will be having an
after-party at the end of the show where
if anyone sends us donations through
super chat we'll be reading off the
messages attached to those donations
during that after-party we also might
never gonna play get around to playing
any games today or anything but we'll
also be reading off I can I can play
over what I'll might play over watchful
we'll see how it goes we'll play it by
ear but we we like to have a lot of fun
on the show obviously apart from talking
about news and and what's what's good in
the tech world we have a couple drinks
which mine's almost gone oh yeah we need
my shoes Cheers
we also occasionally use adult language
so if that's a sensitive thing for you
then beat warrant but we only use it
appropriately when when it's warranted
yep so um we also have stores if you
want to buy something from our stores we
we ask for your support and are very
generous or very grateful
we hope you're generous and making us
grateful by buying our things mine at my
stores biblioth√®que / store or you just
go to bit with tech and there's there's
a assortment of things that you should
check it out get all them I actually
have a new design or two brewing so be
excited for that
the dude spinners are not special Jude
spinners are no on sale they no they're
not there it is still there they're in
low supply and load demands they're
still very popular absolutely my store
start we're dead net yes and you can
find quality merchandise on his store as
well it will also yell Johnson at you
and at the end of the show during the
after party real good if you happen to
buy anything from either of our stores
good things alright let's jump into some
tech news today starting with with with
a banger from tech power up this is
about Lisa soo who's officially going to
deliver a copy text keynote ooh ooh
wonder what that could be about it's
scheduled for Monday May 27th right
before Computex actually officially
starts on the 28th at 10:00 a.m. I think
that's I don't know if that's 10:00 a.m.
Computex yeah they they should specify
yeah that's probably that is type a time
I would think so yeah here it will
actually be sometime in October what if
it was PST I think when the feeling 3:00
in the morning
that's like 3:00 in the morning at least
it seems like I think we all will but
it's very exciting she said that you
know the keynote topic is gonna be
focused on there thank you Paul
the next generation of high performance
computing again wonder wonder what that
could be
this is actually the first time a
keynote speech will be held at the
pre-show international press conference
and Lisa sue is gonna be delivering the
opening keynote this is a fairly big
keynote too big deal sue said that she's
gonna provide new date details about the
next-gen of high performance AMD
platforms and products I am down bring
it on baby
upcoming products she may talk about
apart from horizon 3000 we'll look at
that oh yeah this is this is one of the
this is one of your congratulatory beers
I bought you for the for hitting a
million the abyss barrel-aged
in tequila barrels extending the
celebration
that's a twist absolutely you gotta
gotta spread it out it was it was brute
oh I didn't even see the bottom
brooding tequila barrels for ten months
Wow that's it's older than a nine month
old baby thank God they didn't go the
whole year right yeah never you never go
full year I'll just open it with my
handy dandy pulsar we're proud of
placement uh upcoming products she might
talk about besides third gen Rison which
are all very much looking forward to wax
includes seven nanometer AMD epoch
datacenter processors and potentially
graphics cards that are gonna be the
next generation
Navi architecture for yourself some
because I most certainly I could pour it
for you to their high god I feel rude I
feel like I should have just poured it
for you no no no the the cap is already
off so I'm not scared anymore this is
this is like oh it smells like gasoline
oh yeah
Oh countess what did we get ourselves
into now this is a oh it's gonna be one
of those shows prior to now we've been
drinking Sierra Nevada Pale Ale which is
surely why take you take the rest of OB
oh boy whoo this is 9% just blacker than
my soul 11 it might be 11 Oh God you
could be right though where does it say
oh it's right here it's a very does that
say 11 eboydee I think the whole look
gosh I think that's the living point
that's a triple dance oh this is
basically a 12% bad it's like wine it's
like I'm drinking wine all right real
quick okay there was an announcement
wanted to make forgot at the beginning
of this yes sorry I thought you wanted
me to wait for your half but oh well
just quickly here in Casey's and that
doesn't watch sure Billy coats let me
leave has sent us stuff before you said
something to my P o box unfortunately
they say they keep it for a month but I
checked today and it's already been
returned I'm very sorry I didn't get
this but Billy coats please resend that
because whatever you said I want it okay
sorry about that
Thank You Billy alright so yeah that's
pretty much it I'm excited cuz I'll
actually be there at Computex I don't
know if I'm gonna
the actual keynote yeah I mean I guess I
could get it anyone who's got a press
badge can get in so maybe I will but
also maybe I won't because it'll be
streamed and stuff and usually you can
get more than you work more efficiently
oh Jesus
okay yeah I totally needed that all
right so um yeah we'll be reporting on
whatever news lisa sued plans to deliver
on that day to you directly so you can
hear it straight from us after you hear
it straight from her it's a little bit
redundant but I'm excited I'm excited to
hear more details about rising 3,000
family me too
all right this could also potentially be
an indication that the rumors which I
mean let's face it or pretty reasonable
expectation this would be an event that
they would announce there's the
availability of Rison 3000 series
absolutely so that'd be cool right this
is remarkably smooth I was expecting way
more bite which which my ears meal yeah
which is which is I'll be sipping it
like it's a pale el Sierra Nevada but
it's a 12% stream destroyer
whatever that means yeah it's good I I
was expecting it to be way more intense
it's it's mm-hmm it's subtle in a good
way
cuz because if you brake too much
tequila at me I'd be like yeah tequila's
not my favorite and that's our the smell
I was like it's gonna be really abrasive
yeah but Wow that's this was this was
like a twenty five dollar bottle wow
that's good good good work spared I
spared no expense for your million
subscribers all the credit in the world
well done Kathleen thank you thank you
alright so let's move on switching gears
here to Nvidia and I guess Intel it's
sort of the the clickbait title of
today's stream on my half this is
article from hot hardware been conferred
by the Intel graphics Twitter account
very official that Tom tap Peterson who
is the for now former director of
technical marketing at ed Nvidia has
been snatched up by the folks at Intel
longtime director of technical marketing
yeah
he started there in 2005 yeah and has a
very extensive resume even before that
you know he was he was a CPU engineer
for a long time for IBM Motorola huge
names Broadcom during this career at
Nvidia he helped develop g-sync among a
number of other huge things and he's got
around 50 technical patents to his name
this guy is basically an industry legend
and very smart Paul and I have seen him
around it I had the privilege of talking
to him at several events here in there
over the years he's also really a cool
guy I really like Tom likes to every
time I've met him he's just down there
yeah very chill he'll talk to you about
whatever and super nice so yeah so
Intel's doing well right now with their
talent acquisition it's it's crazy how
people they how many different people
that they have pulled from a wide
variety of locations over the past year
- ain't no money like Intel money yeah
so that's it I mean for anyone who have
use who views all competition is a good
thing which is I think usually usually
the case Intel come in strong with a
third option for a gaming graphics
option yeah would be I'm I'd be happy
with that yeah until improving their
integrated graphics and their CPUs as a
result of adding this talent that's true
I think also would be a nice thing you
know I've recommended the AMD's 2200 G
in 2400 G as this really nice
entry-level build the computer parts
because you can build a computer and you
can game on it you don't have a discrete
graphics card but it's it's good enough
brain Intel not quite as much yeah
there's you can do stuff on until
integrated graphics but it's not that
yeah so yeah so this can only mean good
things for our friends at Intel until
now has under their belt
Jim Keller from AMD Raja Kaduri now
working on their discrete graphics card
Department also from AMD and Ryan trout
from piece of perspective for hey buddy
he's good piece I'll give him a shred up
yo
you're on top of it
I quit in that term years ago oh I try
to I try to get it out there but you
need every so often to you need to
trademark I have that's why he can't use
it all and then sell his own name patent
yeah to him so he can make shirts let's
say give me a shroud out yep and then
now they've got a good old good old tap
so until is doing work they're doing
work man and of course this makes us I
would say even more excited to find out
what what they're brewing in their
discrete GPU market with their their new
XE architecture and I have to imagine
that um at Intel there will be slightly
less chance that like an irate CEO will
get really pissed at at him during when
he's on stage absolutely in the demo
doesn't go perfectly yeah right
I mean that's that's got to be a silver
lining to this as well well I was gonna
say Tom Tom was already leaving in video
one of two ways either getting snatched
up by another company or getting fired
by Jensen yeah it was one of those two
and I'm glad it was the former that that
was that was a that was a relationship
that always kind of rode the line
between like oh they have this kind of
like banter going back and forth where
they kind of give each other a hard time
versus like is he really like you know
at one point I don't know what's real
anymore so but congratulations Tom we're
happy for you and we're also I'm glad
that we're still gonna get to
potentially see you you know yeah you're
in the industry stuff baby to stone the
family all right moving on to Ars
Technica article this has been all over
the web though today a lot of tech news
today a lot of juicy stuff about valve
and their new VR headset that they've
officially confirmed is coming in May
it's called the valve index index index
this is the single image they teased for
everyone no other information was
provided so it's got a sort of a
darkened picture of the actual headset
so this right here is obviously the
bridge of the nose right so looks like
they're facing it I thought that was
worse okay oh I'm sorry maybe it's not
maybe that's not a completely different
it's fine I think you're right I think
you're right that's let's proceed yeah
what is what's this slider do what's
that that's for the IPD that
interpupillary
dad
but changes how how far the the lenses
are away from each other so if you have
like Gollum eyes eyes are super like you
know we've got a hammerhead shark eyes
on either side of your head like what's
his dwarf ear in the cross Ohanian
rhapsody what's his name again
Freddie Mercury yeah okay played Freddie
Mercury oh yeah Rahmi around me rami
malek yeah run down yes the hammerhead
syndrome he totally does his eyes are
slightly wide say yeah right he done the
slider all the way to one end yeah all
right sounds good decide they can
accommodate a wide range exactly the
features it's doing it's deformed
celebrity friendly here there's nothing
over there your balls are already
attached to you you can look them over
you go talk to your mommy so um
yeah go for it the single teaser images
image shows uh you know that the front
the front of it is kind of flanked by
these two large sensors the rumors
claimed that a little support a wider
135 degree field of view which is
actually wider than the original HTC
vive and the oculus rift which we're at
like one around one 110 degrees so they
did a high-contrast look so if you look
they they overexposed the image so they
could see more detail and try to find
out more it's pretty good idea the dots
they're talking the dots that they're
talking about if you look they're kind
of really hard to see but you see three
of them on here and three of them right
there so they're saying that there are
similar dots on the vibe which might in
which the vibe uses as an outside
tracking sensor ah all of the vibes
infrared trackers okay so that's kind of
interesting the two giant lenses that
you see at the top I think implied that
inside out tracking managed entirely by
the headset without any extra webcams or
sensors may also be in the works the
physical slider that I pointed out the
IPD interpupillary distance okay for
optimal comfort for your remy malik eyes
and again a may 20 19 launch also means
that this headsets gonna coincide
coincidentally with the oculus rift
the oculus quest I should say not the
rift the oculus quest which is their
wireless
PC headset so as well as their PC
connected oculus rift s so good good
timing VR VR nuts who are looking for a
new hmd are gonna have their options cut
out for them come maybe this year in a
new generation that's good and a new
generation yeah hopefully cheaper too we
are just keeps getting cheaper I may
need to upgrade my VR stuff I need you
use it first yeah I need to reset up the
living room for it yeah yeah I'll do
that when the htpc update happens here
you know so exciting stuff if you're
into VR very uninteresting if you're not
so let's move on to our next article
from WC CF tech this is also a headliner
gtx 1650 gaming benchmarks leaked out
who the low sort of entry-level
successor to the the gtx 1050 yeah 1050
i almost forgot what it was the
temperature the whole sixteen series
just throws me all the numbers the
nomenclature office it's all muddy now
yeah so um this these are these are just
uh you know benchmarks that were found
on the Final Fantasy 15 benchmark
database tested on 1080p with high
quality settings had a score of thirty
eight hundred and three points versus
thirty seven hundred and twenty eight
points on the Radeon rx 570 so edges out
the competition slightly for around the
same price more or less as what we would
assume but not by a whole lot I mean
3700 to thirty-eight hundred points is
pretty close but it's still better and
you can find one around the same price
and whine on the cards scored close to
the GTX 1063 gigabyte model which scored
thirty nine hundred and one point so if
this is all rumored to be true and you
know it's it's gonna perform similarly
to how it did in the Final Fantasy 15
benchmark we can assume that the GTX
1650 is somewhere in between and rx 570
and potentially a GTX 1063 gigabyte Mont
variants so that's pretty cool we have
some anticipated specs again this is
mostly rumored here we've got four gigs
of DDR 5 on a 128 bit bus with eight
gigabit per second speeds that's giving
us 128 gigabytes a second of memory
bandwidth
and that's verses 112 gigabytes a second
on the GTX 1050 so quite a bit quite a
bit faster than its predecessor very
much how we saw 1660 and 1660 TI
outperform what gtx 960 and even a gtx
1060 by quite a bit and we also have
potentially a thirteen hundred and
ninety five megahertz base and fifteen
hundred and 60 megahertz boost using a
tu 117 GPU that's a first we haven't
seen the TU 117 yet so little baby well
baby GPU notable here is that there is
potentially going to be a TI model and a
non TI model and the TI model is
obviously going to cost a little bit
more and may potentially be on par with
an RX 580 we don't know the pricing of
course and it's also potentially going
to feature GD d are six memory whereas
the non TI versions gonna have five
gddr5 so these are gonna be really
powerful cards I mean even there they're
older they're bigger brothers the GTX 16
16 and 16 60 TI are extremely power
efficient these are potentially gonna be
sub 100 watt TDP GPUs that won't require
much to drive so you can expect adding
board partner cards that launch custom
models and stuff obviously there's
actually me like that Edition or
anything like that anything like that
was there an expected reportedly
launched on April 22nd okay yep 20 days
people will just be getting over there
there we'd hang over two days after at
4:20 when these cars go on sale those
we'd hanger overs are killer and totally
weak and requires all right so that's
that's fun GTX 1650 keep your eyes out
for that gel I haven't received one yet
from Nvidia I couldn't even tell you if
I did yeah it's very good know what it's
like oh this is something for some
reason that's associated with like the
canary in the coal mine
thank you something for me if it's like
you can obviously tell people I I don't
have one of these right I've heard
nothing of this yes and then like a week
from now you know like oh another leak
of the 1650 whatever and then like
silence a food that's the canary in the
coal mine tell us it tells you that
that's actually heaven right of course
we wouldn't talk about that publicly no
no definitely not
fortunately this is all just a dream and
I am a canary subhan to the article here
we have hot hardware's article on
Google+ being completely killed Google+
social media platform that was supposed
to overtake Facebook at one point a good
eight years ago is now dying how can how
can you kill that which has no life that
is true it never really took off it had
very poor execution it launched in 2011
and it was just really really bad how
they pitched it to people that you know
for starters they forced YouTube users
to have and create a Google+ account
which no one was happy with remember
that whole thing there's a show on
YouTube here you're here picture or your
banner go do that on Google+ they were
really trying to cram it down our
throats everything I've known as Google
Plus has happened automatically because
I did something on some other platform
it's gonna do this on Google+ to uh sign
whatever yep exactly so they were really
just forceful with it and it totally
backfired it just wasn't a great
platform some of the concepts were fine
like I kind of liked the idea of like
being able to put people into circles
and like creating a wall around certain
people who I didn't want to see all my
posts yeah I thought that was a cool
idea but it just the whole execution was
was pretty awful there was also a three
year old security flaw that was
discovered in early 2018 that wasn't
disclosed into disclosed until later
that year and that's what ultimately
made Google decided to shut down the
platform Google originally said we fix
the flaw nah just shut the whole thing
down exactly what do you do when no
problem doing like it's kind of like you
say too much down too much developer
time and work on
right just kill it yeah they cut their
losses platform you know it's the best
way to solve a problem you know on a
platform that on the deserted platform
really is to kill the platform itself
and that's what ultimately led to its
shut down um I'm okay with this I'm okay
with it too oh let's see anything else
here yeah they push the data up because
originally there was a breach and
they're like oh it's bad it's affecting
half million people let's let's shut it
down let's say August 2019 they set the
date and then earlier I guess it was
late last year there was another breach
that affected potentially up to 52
million No
so that's over a hundred hundred times
what it originally was and then they're
like alright we're gonna move the data
up to April so now it's April and
they're canning Google+ for good Google
said that it's got very low engagement
it's always had low engagement currently
there's about 90 percent 90 percent of
user sessions on the platform lasted
less than five seconds which you know I
can relate to which means someone went
there was like I'm on Google+ exactly no
yeah right where whenever yeah we've all
been there for five seconds mm-hmm so
rest in peace Google+ you will not be
missed all right all right all right so
I'm looks like about razor's turret
gaming keyboard and mouse nice for the
Xbox one which is now available we
talked about this on a previous episode
thank you hardware for the article this
is for console this keyboard and mouse
gaming peripherals typically associated
with a PC now for Xbox what do you know
and razors the first one to come to the
scene with with the goods so the the
peripherals feature Razer chroma 5g
advanced optical sensors and a 2.4
gigahertz wireless connection you get a
single unified dongle for the keyboard
and mouse which I love unified down oh
yeah it's the only way
one type of dongle all I'll receive I'm
a one
songul kind of man all right both
feature xbox dynamic lighting a thousand
Hertz polling rate and Razer synapse
three as for the keyboard if you got
mechanical switches didn't say what kind
of switches though it's probably Razer
zone Razer switches mechanical switch I
know they have their own kale okay third
zero I thought they'd make them in-house
no yeah they bought some they're just
making their own boundary oh yeah man
enough I don't know I've never reviewed
that's weird I feel like a bad person
now I've never reviewed or owned a razer
keyboard in my life I'm sure you have
you have raised your laptop so those
have raised their keyboards in them
those are different I mean like the
desktop PC peripheral ones fair sure but
anyway 50-gram actuation force 10 key
roll over and anti-ghosting mid height
keycap so somewhere in between
low-profile and standard is where you'll
find it just over 23 inches with the
mouse tray expanded so it's kind of like
the Razer lap dog in a way where it goes
on your goes on your lap but it's got a
little pullout tray whereas as opposed
to just a fixed R a fixed extension on
the Razer I'm sorry the coarser lap dog
so it's kind of cool you can tuck it
away if you want to because these are
also compatible with PC as you might
expect if you let's say you're a gamer
who does both why not both you can
easily switch between your console and
PC the other thing here is that you know
apart from being PC compatible the users
can fully program all the keys on the
keyboard and you'll also be offered
further gaming options that aren't
available on console the turn Mouse
features a scroll wheel seven
programmable buttons with onboard memory
and cloud storage I have have unverified
exclusive information from chat with
that according to all ball one five six
razer switches are now made by gree tech
gree tech oh yeah I have heard that
actually
it's his base he's unfamiliar we all
trust al Ball 156 but that doesn't send
you know I think like an absurd claim to
me I've definitely heard that before but
can't confirm for sure the other thing
oh I forgot to mention that you get 11
hours of battery life with the keyboard
so obviously Wireless with that's with
default lighting like
the Box default lighting but you get up
to 43 hours if you don't need lighting
at all the mouse itself gets you 30
hours of battery with default lighting
or 50 hours without a life cycle of 50
million clicks two year warranty with
tech support and 14 days of risk free
returns Paul without looking it without
looking at the Google Doc how much do
you think this set of peripherals goes
for two hundred and forty nine dollars
and ninety nine cents u.s. you
son-of-a-bitch you looked at the Google
but I wasn't looking at the Google Doc I
was looking at the article damn it I
forgot that I got the Google Doc from
the article I should have I should have
pinned the source he said that I would
have I would have admitted if I was
looking at it from there but I had just
look no I don't yeah I just that's why I
whistled anyone doesn't believe me go
back like 10 20 seconds I was like clip
that I was like I was like or something
like that right I did that that's when I
saw the price to 50 someone had someone
meme that the moment like my face wine
or like the moment when you see the
price less steep now super steep so this
is they're making this and marketing it
directly for the consoles because yeah
because support official support for
that is coming isn't like I am very
console ignorant I don't dabble in it
very much at all seem like can't you
plug in a keyboard and mouse to consoles
aren't there ways to do that maybe not
directly plug-and-play but isn't that
something that already exists on some
level yeah I don't know I I think some
work better than others yeah some work
better than others I think if it's wired
though you can but to be honest no one's
gonna want wired so maybe a wireless is
so and Wireless is is more unreliable
like you're not guaranteed support for a
wireless keyboard or Mouse oh there are
certain one there are certain ones that
are like guaranteed to work that people
on forums can confirm like yeah this
works but for the most part this is just
guaranteed to work it's you know
seamless it's it's optimized for the
platform and that that would be a good
selling point for excuse me a console
which would commonly be in the living
room where wireless setup would be very
nice I've been using I already met I
think I said this last week the Corsair
dark dark dark pro dark dark something
pro dark
dangit and I forget the name me too dark
or dark or yes I've been using the
Corsair dark dark or mouse yeah out of
them living on your xbox yeah because
I've been playing Grand Theft Auto right
GTA 5 to go into the missions and
keyboard you use with that I just I'm
just using this the logitech wireless ok
keyboards that I got it's it's it's more
of a multimedia keyboard it's working
but most of the time I'm on the
controller it's only when I need to
shoot stuff that I go forward and use
the mouse and keyboard how's the mouse
support in GTA 5 with the Xbox great is
it really I'm not on the Xbox I'm on the
PC oh okay I'm sorry I thought you were
I'd be GTA 5 on Xbox 360 in 2013 but I
never I've never played back through the
missions since the PC update ok all the
way through yeah that's and that's the
other thing about like this price is
that it's a lot of money to pay when you
won't even be able to really use it at
least to my knowledge you won't be able
to really use it for every game right
yeah take like cuz there are some games
that are adding that already addresses
the dark core which is an expensive
Mouse it's nine bucks but apparently on
sale for $80 a oh not sponsored by
Corsair but that's it's been been doing
good for me it pairs up with the
keyboard to the case 64 right I also
don't remember the model of that it's a
six deep k 68 no k 65 KC maybe is case
no it's not 64 any what's one of those
so 250 would be fine because the thing
is they haven't really added some K 6363
yeah geez I picked every number but that
one they they they haven't added
keyboard and mouse support natively too
many games yet I mean I know fortnight
is supported and even that's been kind
of buggy at launch forget what I get but
I guess if you want to give a comparison
for the razer stuff to a company that
makes similar products that have similar
capabilities the lap board by itself is
60 bucks
so plus just for the drop in 60 + 100
and yeah did you buy it as a combo is
160 that's not including the mouse mouse
70 or 80 so
it's it's in the same price range yeah
but that's still a lot of money it's a
shit ton of money for peripherals I
would buy it in a heartbeat if I was a
hardcore Xbox one Xbox player whatever
gamer I'd buy that set for 250 bucks in
a heartbeat if every game was natively
keyboard and mouse supported but because
there's only a couple right now and even
those out of that small group aren't
great they still need a lot of work I I
just don't know who's gonna buy that I
don't know
got RGB so far too reasonable Kyle got
RGB
alright next article from TechRepublic
about the raspberry PI's new rival
there's a new single board computer on
the block and his name is oh joy joy oh
joy - which is now on sale it's supposed
to be one of the fastest sub $100 single
board products computers on the market
okay okay so it's like Raspberry Pi kind
of like on steroids but of course it's
gonna be a bit more expensive it's now
available for sixty three dollars for a
two gig model or $79 for a four gig
model still under 100 bucks not too
shabby 1.8 gigahertz arm core a 73 based
processor and 21.9 gigahertz arm cortex
a53 based processors with the SOC that's
able to switch tasks between processors
processors to save energy
manufactured on the 12 nanometer process
so that's gonna allow for top speed for
longer before being throttled to reduce
temperatures so that's kind of cool
because obviously there's speaking of
which there's probably no cooling on
this thing either part yeah I don't
think there is maybe a little heat sink
or something board makers the board's
makers show the CPU running about seven
times faster than a Raspberry Pi 3 plus
in several benchmarks although it's
unclear if they were testing it against
a b or b + model which is the the faster
of the two when you're talking about
Raspberry Pi it replaces last year's
kind of canceled Odroid and one which
was designed for high-end Android TV
appliances compared to the Raspberry Pi
B Raspberry Pi 3 B plus it's got a
faster in more modern CPU
ddr4 memory which enables 4k video
playback of
h.265 encoding encoded footage and it
has four USB 3.0 ports with support for
128 gig emmc flash storage and true
gigabit ethernet so it's packing a lot
of power a lot more than a Raspberry Pi
there are a couple downsides though you
don't get built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
like you do with Raspberry Pi 3 mm which
on a little thing I think that'd be a
really handy feature to have so take
your pick of course you can always think
up those super tiny USB Wi-Fi adapters
now as well but again you only have 4
ports to work with so gonna have to pick
your battles here
it's gonna be running a bun to 18.04 LTS
as for its operating system which is
officially supported until January of
2023 as well as Android 9 pi I don't
know if that means it's running both or
one or the other probably one or the
other
yeah ok at a time right oh and I'm not
maybe you can dual boot time I don't I'm
not sure I've never worked with any of
these types of boards but the PI is
allegedly easier if you're novice trying
to get into this type of niche hobby
there's more guides and resources online
for Raspberry Pi owners then there are
for this very new device there's a broad
suite of supported operating systems and
software if you're not familiar with
these devices they have a range of uses
they're low powered but they're also
incredibly tiny and have quite a bit of
connectivity as time goes on so you can
use them as a media center file center
maybe just an everyday computer I
actually got a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ for
Christmas last year and I haven't even
opened it because I I kind of know what
I want to do with it but I feel like
it's just I know nothing about it and so
like I know as soon as I start it it's
gonna be the beginning of this long
journey fun journey but it's it's gonna
be a lot of like research and time that
I put into it so dive in for the right
I'm ready yeah I know I gotta get my
feet wet heavy so that's cool let's see
our last article is from overclocked 3d
so Galax Marek you know Galax right good
old Galax what's their name I preferred
them before they dropped the y-yeah
galaxy was like a real word that didn't
sound weird okay but they've launched
their Hall of Fame series m2 SSD that
has an integrated heat pipe what it's an
all-white Hall of Fame and about two SSD
packing a massive heat pipe heatsink and
Toshiba made 64 layer 3d TLC nan so it's
got triple level cell Mandarin Andres
match and it's got no RGB lighting on it
not a speck of lighting okay I
appreciate that
however it's got the heat sink that's
CNC machined with integrated heat pipe
resulting in a white copper and silver
aesthetic as you can see which you know
match with most most systems out there
but ducts thick it is very thick looks
like a whole pack of gum instead of just
one stick the funny thing to point out
about the heat sinks on the on the the
m-dot to nvme SSDs NAND actually does
better when it's less hot like you want
your NAND to be warmer it's to a point
it's the controller
oh yeah the controller controller that
you need to keep cool so as you're
curious where this heat pipe goes I
would assume it goes over they control
but also it looks like they just bend it
around and kind of goes across the top
here which seems yeah I don't know weird
is that just being them being like look
we put a heat pipe in here right we need
to tear down normally the heat pipe
would solder to like a bank of copper
fins or something like that I don't know
I don't know what's going on with the
housing here I would assume it's some
kind of heat sink or something like that
but it looks like it's more designed for
aesthetics than it is for heat
dissipation so yeah all right I'd be
very curious to see what's under the
hood if it's actual individual fin
arrays like if it's our fin fins or if
it's just a piece of metal yeah you know
I mean like a solid block or like a GPU
heatsink or like a CPU heatsink where
it's it's got fins I'm not sure exactly
what it's gonna look like or how the
heat pipe interfaces with the rest of
but I mean it's also possible that they
only needed needed a finite amount of
cooling to keep the thing - a lot of the
thing to perform but then in spec yeah
and that most of the design is aesthetic
because once they did whatever they did
you know it was kind of getting the job
done I guess no but I'm sure this will
be put to rigorous testing by lots of
people yeah and we'll find that out in
the future
yep but that's okay I guess I'll just
really quickly read off the speeds here
3400 I'm sorry yeah thirty four hundred
and two thousand megabytes per second
respectively for sequential reads and
writes that's for the 512 gigabyte model
but you go up to 2,800 megabytes per
second for your sequential writes if you
opt for the one terabyte or two terabyte
variant 400,000 random read I ops and we
have your pretty standard 2280 form
factor pcie 3.0 by four-lane config
using a face on controller right now
this is focused on the Chinese market
and we may see it come overseas in the
future but for now I wouldn't expect to
find these on the shelves of your local
Micro Center anytime soon where are you
going what what are you unboxing this
wasn't planned this isn't in the show
duck gigabyte allowed to switch things
up Boris would or a gigabyte Drive do
you guys want me to unbox this Oh Gary I
don't think so that's always the most
and this was given to me I was not sure
there's any NDA or anything like the
most reassuring one because you
mentioned a phazon controller uh-huh
which makes me think that under the hood
these are very similar sequential reads
34 80 megabytes per second which is
fairly close pretty much in the ballpark
3400 megabytes per second writes
2000 megabytes per second yeah exact
same for that this is a 512 gig
right so does that have a heatsink and a
heat Python I don't know it's where did
you get that it's heat shrink on the
debate
welcome to their I broke into their
factory oh I want to break in why don't
you invite me they're just getting ahead
knives I went there to get something
else and he was like here try this out -
that's pretty much okay this is I'm
doing a very poor job unboxing it yeah
you're terrible so this is the Auris RG
o its RGB it is all RGB m dot o R is RGB
m dot 2 nvme I already know fast 512
gigs comes in this little box just like
this it looks like you're unboxing
jewelry sleek packaging every kiss
begins with Oh where's my knife they
might have grabbed that here no no no
the orange handled one is a flathead
this is a noise or slot yeah this is
available use the lever it really does
stick in there like this is what what
lipsticks it's just the upper boxes are
yeah tight oh there we go very tighten
that oh it's pretty nice pretty fancy
try not to get the glare on it there
that's also a bit on the thicker side
yeah so she said does have a heatsink on
it but at least that heat sink it's it's
RGB if you're gonna put right fat
heatsink on there that helps the cooling
mat as well do some RGB on it right look
it's got a black PCB under there so
there's only the logo that lights up
yeah okay and because it's gigabyte they
they're doing communications through the
MDOT to slot so you'd know it I do not
believe this requires like you to wire
some weird plug down there to plug in
are that's good so it can actually
control it with the the or software you
see this there you go okay okay alright
that's the end of your half of the show
right that's it I'm done hey yep alright
we'll be right back guys hey thank you
in advance to anyone who wants to do
time stands for my half oh yeah thank
you I love you and you can have my
babies I'll be back for my half of the
show links in the description and hit
the thumbs up button on Kyle's half of
the show if you put blood sweat and
tears
this happens episode I did you show him
respect and other bodily fluids that
she'll be not named alright TMI we
should probably go yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
