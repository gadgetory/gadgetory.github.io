okay
hello welcome welcome da from hardware
so 190 side beat if you miss sigh hey go
ahead and check it out on Paul channel
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware you
can find the link in my video
description or just stay right where you
are if you're streaming too or if you're
watching us on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware that's why I show that we view
every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time and we occasionally have a
nice sub college beverage adult beverage
cheers to all of you if you're watching
this at home at work wherever you may be
in the pool we occasionally in the pool
and the lounge we occasionally use adult
language on the show we'd like to get a
little loose and have some fun so if you
if you're a sensitive to that sort of
thing be be warned wellthat was a
terrible for what that's trying to do it
quick so I could drink some Swedish
cheers and and enjoy got to the truth
looks like they haven't updated your
firmware on on pouring sensitivity yet
that's okay that's a perfectly human
error to make a Kyle that's a normal
normal mistake that a human would make
very quick it internally googling human
human mistakes and there's impressive
I'm impressed
so watch watch tide a if you if you have
no idea what we're talking about right
now
we also occasionally sell things on our
stores that you will occasionally buy it
is occasionally support us on my store
is bit wit Duck Tech and I am currently
selling the flash store or it works
without the story okay yeah it's a
purist it's a Pierce plant you gave up
on having a website besides this I'm on
the web sounds like you know let's just
make it a storefront just I follows in
your voices at home like go the home
just goes to the store oh no it does go
to the home but there's just no updated
content it's it's like years old
that was that was updated possible
hardware number 77 if you don't think a
trip down memory lane let's say like
that X slash home site so feeding your
story and that's all real time okay
that's all current but well yes they
whipped out tech is my story
screw of confidence shirts still on sale
you can go ahead
pick one of those up in either flavor
Paul store is Paul's Harbor net he has
the captain thumbscrew shirt yes as well
as a bunch of other nice merchandise
that is super high-quality will yield
Johnson actually at the end of the show
if you happen to pick something from
either of our stores with that beer set
it's great beers at home much much
better port in yours I'm screwed level
and then see I guess that's pretty much
it that was a really quick and efficient
intro we can just dive straight into the
news starting with our big headline
today which is AMD's x 570 chipset 590
that was sorry thanks x 590 I like
reddit is the suckers out there bethany
mota x 570 already now they're just
regretting it you can't buy X 570 yes
I've sent that out but the X 590 chips
that's been teased by Asus was seen in a
gigabyte BIOS as well Twitter user at
1:1 us must one us and us I don't know
how about how to pronounce that he
actually tweeted it out this this Asus
teaser of X 590 he's apparently the
developer for the DRAM calculator
Verizon um so you know he's got some
street cred there I suppose but it's
very very basic teaser it says X 590
coming soon and you can see it's just
sort of blacked out a blacked out
motherboard you can barely see the edges
the the corners of the board looks good
full ATX offering but not cycling it was
the tire delivery our delivery is uh
it's almost invisible
we should i'm not existent I wanna see
builds I'd do an analysis of this
picture he'd be able to be able to pull
like so much information probably just
for those four tiny corners of the board
but still be like a 15 minute video
since since then computer base de is
sort of an isolated incidents here but
computer-based de found some upcoming
gigabyte X 570 motherboard BIOS files
that contain options for X 570 and x5 90
chipsets if you look at the code there
there you see 598 chipset in the flesh
so there is little to be known about X
590 right now it's still very much
shrouded in mystery there is some
speculation though people are guessing
that there's gonna be more PCI agent
four lanes offered for power users going
to
take advantage of more i/o for example
and also potentially better overclocking
support for the higher-end top shelf
CPUs from AMD such as the horizon 939 50
X which is a 16 core CPU that's arriving
in September which may also kind of make
sense the as to why that shift being
delayed and pushed back beyond the the
rest of the rise in 3000 family perhaps
a barista working on the x5 x5 90
chipsets and waiting to release their
flagship CPU when that chipsets finally
ready just a speculation there by cue
you're slowly moving out of frame oh I'm
sorry
I'm sorry okay
okay I'll get more more inward all right
let's move it no no you're you're told
if I thought you it's not you it's the
spammers back wow look at that
oh oh god that person can I put
user in timeout okay I'm just gonna keep
coming where's the auto banner so many
of them I don't that wasn't going on on
my channel is it I don't think so
they must only hit the people with one
and a half million subscribers and yeah
right that's why I let's try keeping it
may be reasonable just over a million
subscriber range ah we go for that all
very well very methodically planned okay
so that's X 590 again we don't have much
to say about it any thoughts on that
Paul or I was gonna say cuz like we were
tired I started to Joe because we want
to build him a new editing system soon
and he was talking about the new rise
and chips and the core count because you
know more cores and threads for editing
and transcoding he renders procs proxies
for every video yet edits and stuff yeah
he was like so what's the difference and
I was like well if you look at thread
Ripper or even the high end high end
desktop Intel stuff it's really like
connectivity like PCI Express Lanes
right because you have what 64 with
thread Ripper yeah which is a lot so I
was like the the my Riptide setup
because I have I don't know how many
nvme SSDs I have connected and more SSDs
and I kept a bunch of a bunch of of
drives storage drives and that's
really nice and convenient but there's
no way I could get that level of that
many drives connected up the mainstream
rise ensure even even the third gen
stuff because they're not really adding
more PCIe leans or anything like that
you still got 24 mm-hmm 16 go to the PCI
Express slots for dedicated print nvme
drive right and then 4 go off to the
chipset and then they're multiplexed up
from there for more connectivity
yeah it's PCI Express Gen 4 so you can
get a lot more connectivity like through
the chipset and stuff with that without
necessarily bottlenecking but it's still
not going to be a full fat connection
like you'd want for an nvme raid array
or something like that yeah all that is
to say something I could see them doing
to potentially differentiate X 590 if
this truly is something that they're
coming out with is like every single
board has integrated PL x chip or a
multiplexer for the PCI Express Lanes to
give it more which in the past was
something that they did only with the
highest end motherboards because those
multiplexer chips are like a pretty
significant added cost for the
motherboard yeah but especially for the
12 core and 16 core that that would
people are more likely that's word that
would see yeah that would seem like a
more practical use for it there because
that would make it much more competitive
with I end desktop options that makes me
makes me have high hopes for 3rd gen
read Ripper because it's gonna need to
step up its own game quite significantly
because with X 570 now especially X 590
it seems to be encroaching on a lot of
the nice features that that platform
offers so it really puts in your mind
like okay well the threaded brew
developers are gonna really have to
separate that those two those two
platforms enough for people to actually
buy into them so that's it's a very
interesting but we also have some news
on the lower end sort of budget entry
level platforms such as the B 550 and
be 528 528 528 528 be 550 and a 520
chipsets which are also AMD am for those
are presumably going to support PCIe
gen3 but they very well may support Gen
4 2 because Gen 4 is backwards
compatible with Gen 3 and they're the
Verizon 3,000 chips also have 24 Gen 4
lanes that it's possible that these
chipsets can have their own like the
primary PCIe by 16 Lane or slot I should
say and one n dot 2 port actually
supporting PCI agent for that would be
wired wired directly to the processor so
that would be kind of cool if you have
like a budget you know sort of a editing
system or a workstation system that
could really utilize PCI agent for
storage for example as we've talked
about extensively Gaming is not going to
benefit that much from PCIe gen for it
hardly benefits a whole lot from PCIe
gen3 as is so where the real gains are
to be had here is it's really within
storage we saw a lot of the numbers that
companies like gigabyte were showing off
at Computex just recently of just
ridiculous raid arrays like for 2
terabyte nvme SSDs that are PCH and for
hitting speeds of like upwards of 15
gigabytes a second which is ludicrous
and we even saw a demo at the press
conference just before e3 where they
were showing off 8k an 8k editing
workflow I believe in Premiere Pro where
they were showing a much smoother if
that was playback with this agent I
don't think it was premiere I think it
was it was a DaVinci Resolve as well
okay so as resolve but still a very
popular program that was just super
fluid very very smooth playback at 8k
specifically leveraging the the
additional bandwidth on PCI agent for
there's a few people in YouTube chat
talking about an audio issue the
absolutely no one in twitch chat has
mentioned it makes me think that it
might be a YouTube thing I've seen a few
German to reload or something
oh I'm checking our levels and stuff
over here and it looks like we're still
ok so ok I don't think that's check your
salaries check yourself before you wreck
is there but yeah peace agent for is
something to definitely get excited
about if you're one of the users who can
actually leverage the new tech that new
standard but it'll be interesting to see
if whether or not be 550 will be able to
support it in some way it might be like
limited features or something like that
but most people are saying the audio
spine so apologies to anyone who is
having problems maybe try refreshing or
something ok reverb reverb is normal
that's because we still need more yeah
you have a lot already in there I have a
lot of sound deadening material on that
wall that was yeah it's probably that
wall too but I mean I mean you've got
the window which cuts out definitely
it's got you know fabric blinds over it
now so I feel like it's like I maybe
need to do some sound insulation for the
ceiling perhaps - oh yeah the ceiling is
a big flat I think it's really the
ceiling - because whatever is hitting
there it's just bouncing up there so I
have to figure it out sorry sorry guys
I'm still worried it's a work in
progress
I may even move this whole studio
somewhere else completely in in the near
future but I've said too much let's move
on to our next article which is from
hexxus about the RX 5700 the other
headline in today's half of the show
which is some unfortunate news if you
were hoping to get your hands on a full
blown adding board partner custom
modeled Rx 5700 series GPU at launch
that is unfortunately not the case
according to flood Zilla who quoted
various sources and discovered that
there will be no custom rx 5700 series
designs until mid-august and August and
that's and that's in quote if all goes
well ooh
that that that is dangerous dangerous
unfortunate line it leaves a very
open-ended but there
best we can hope from custom models in
mid mid-august for now if you wanted to
purchase a 5700 or 5700 XT at launch
which is going to be presumably on July
7th then you'll be limited to one of
their AMD's a reference design coolers
which is fortunately being well-received
by companies and press around around
around the world for its airflow
optimized and acoustically tuned
contours
it's got vapor chamber cooling tech it's
OC ready with a six plus one phase power
design and it has pre applied specially
selected graphite based thermal
interface material so it's got a lot
going for it of course
speculated this is all kind of
speculation as to how well it's going to
perform until the reviews come out so
again don't preorder these just because
it looks good on paper because people
have been saying good things you never
really know how it's gonna perform until
it's actually out on the market and and
properly tested so yeah I was I wasn't
really sure I felt it was a 50/50 shot
of custom models being available on
launch it's not it's not uncommon for
this sort of thing to happen and you
know mid August is really just about a
month around the corner from from launch
day so it's not too bad yeah I'm kind of
curious to see if board partners will
switch up their designs for the 5,700 or
if they're gonna sort of just rehash
what they've used with RX Vega and an
even like the cooler designs on our TX
cards or if they're gonna be completely
you know I imagine we see a lot of a lot
of reused cooler designs for yeah
because it's a watching you cooler and
they and the heatsink of the fan yeah
but what you know it's really who's
really happy about this information
who's that gamers Nexus Oh
this means they get to do a water-cooled
mod I was gonna say yeah for as soon as
I read that I thought that was in here
but uh
on it at some point which I love that
Jennifer I haven't that's great maybe
it's always always fun to watch
we should one up and we should do that
too no promises no guarantees and if you
guys hear a fan noise cows fan and his
laptop does keep spinning up again is my
laptop I might be hearing that I don't
know it's probably chrome 50 60 percent
CPU it's is hovering between 30 and 60
percent CPU utilization because Google
Chrome is as 19 does that mean there's
19 instances of engine chrome tab as an
instance but I don't have 19 tabs open I
have maybe seven or eight look there's
two here two three four five six seven
Deveney we've got secret tabs secret
tabs abs it opens in the background that
no monitors your progress and what
you're doing it that sounds terrible I'm
switching the mozo I actually already
supposed to Firefox than my my
workstation everyone install Firefox
everyone install Firefox it in uninstall
chrome Chrome is the new edge and edge
is the new chrome since they're both
using chromium edges the new chrome
fight me all right let's move on to oh
speaking of nvme gen for hey SSDs
techpowerup didn't article on gigabyte
releasing their new MVA media and for
SSDs it's going to feature the Toshiba
be is C for NAND flash modules and it's
gonna offer up to 40 percent boost over
PCIe gen3 as I mentioned the write read
and write speeds were like ridiculously
high over 10 gigabits per second when
you have multiple PCI agent for nvme
drives in like a raid 0 array for
example I do they stamp text on the side
like thermal design for jet can't see it
you can't really where does that where
it's not gonna be visible that's not
like it's a good text no it's a hard to
read it's just basic damnit anybody it's
sequential reads of this drive just
single Drive are going to be or
sequential reads and writes are about
five thousand and forty four hundred
megabytes per second respectively which
is ridiculously fast it's gonna be
offered in 500 gig one terabyte and two
terabyte capacities in a two twenty two
eighty module sizing mmm pretty standard
Oh a two terabyte mmm that to drive is
really just awesome oh yes it's so great
I still have my I have two of the the
960 pro 2 terabyte ones that I put in
the elite build back in the day now one
of them just been sadly reduced to an
external drive because that's such it's
it's such a waste over it's a
performance but I just needed the
capacity more than anything because our
file our project files are so large
these days we're moving them around and
then the other one is in my primary
workstation so that one's actually being
used as a scratch disk and it's
phenomenal hmm
but nice these are gonna be even better
so maybe I should upgrade Repton copper
to gradison wrapped in copper it's got a
full body copper heat sink and la IRD
high conductivity thermal pad which is
gonna help with the heat dissipation as
well as the the 30 stand blasted fins on
the actual heat stick itself
these are ultra durable certified
meaning that they've been put through
the gnarliest of tests in in gigabytes
warehouse facilities in Taiwan that
means that they've been stressed under
extreme load use case scenarios under
high heat high pressure they probably
have people jump on this to use on that
that that hot room that they built for
that I would imagine so I can't I can't
imagine they'd you know stop using that
thing so yeah we did take a tour of the
gigabyte factory and just sort of saw
some other they're testing setups for QA
yeah to make sure that you know products
are gonna be able to withstand the most
extreme balls-to-the-wall
scenarios and it's it's pretty
impressive it's pretty impressive when
you walk over and it's like warehouse
and then there's this wall with windows
in it and like in there is where we do
ultra durable testing like the
temperature is always 55 C or hotter and
it's just racks and racks of parts in
there that bear being tested under load
and then it's like a person walking
around in there with like a checklist
and I feel so bad for this night that it
must be that must be miserable
yeah to check on those systems and
whatever is required there can't you
reassign me to the Chernobyl office yeah
something like safer better personal air
conditioners sooo there's something like
that yeah
but there really is like sort of this
torture test that that gigabyte puts
some of their products through in order
to receive an ultra durable
certification and so if you see that
badge it actually means something we've
seen it ourselves it means that it's
survived and endured some insane torture
but that's that's that drive that's
that's the it's just called the Auris or
a 70 mm for SSD which I guess is really
all you need and then finally last
article from my half is is about CD
Projekt RED the developers of cyberpunk
2077 essentially revealing the specs
that they used for their PC that they
used to run the the e3 demo hmm so this
is from spiel times they reported that
the system that they used consists of an
RT X Titan and an 80 700 K from Intel on
an asus rog Strix z 370 i gaming IP
export so they're using a mini ITX port
which I thought was kind of interesting
and a samsung 960 Pro there's actually
that they actually did a call back to
what the CD Projekt RED demo system
looked like in at Gamescom last year
it's very similar to this one except
they upgraded the GPU from a GTX kti to
now in RTX Titan which makes sense
because the game was recently announced
to support ray tracing so if they wanted
to show that off you know in their demo
then obviously they need the hardware
support to drive it
excuse me we don't know the resolution
or the frame rate that the demo was run
at but I am also confused because wasn't
wasn't this just a cinematic trailer
like I'm wondering like did they need
all these crazy specs if it was just
like couldn't they have just made it a
MOV file like rendered it out as a video
there was no gameplay to my knowledge
right then actually showing gameplay
real-time rendering of the title so I
feel like a lot of games now when they
run the demo they'll tell you it's not a
video that's playing with thinking it's
it's the demo being ready right right
so maybe that's it that was the case
here
yeah ok then that probably makes sense
if this was the game engine running
rather than just a video file but I'm
not showing this by the way I know you
were sad about did you get flagged last
week I don't think it did really yeah
all of those three videos that we showed
you didn't kids I honestly think it's
still monetized let me double check well
hey assume ads first in the place how's
that possible
I showed like 12 different trailers from
major publishers and developers then not
a single flecked I hate you YouTube I'm
not asking the meeting monetized by the
way I'm just I'm just saying you're very
inconsistent with your algorithm all
right so what what is comforting to know
about this game is that because it's
gonna be cross-platform on PC
PlayStation 4 Xbox one it should mean
that it's gonna be fairly scalable so
you should be able to run this game
pretty effectively with say in RTX 20 60
or even a GTX 1060 should run it or if
you're on the AMD side like an Rx live
80 you should be able to run it pretty
comfortably 68 60 Plus FPS with quality
settings that are either equal to or
presumably
than what you'd find out the console
obviously since it is so scalable
however if you want to take full
advantage of all the eye candy and you
want to you know rate racing and stuff
you probably be better off with like an
RT X 2070 2080 and beyond but yeah I
can't wait to see the rate racing in
this game even though I probably won't
even have time to appreciate it because
I'll be killing killing cybernetic bad
guys but that's gonna conclude it for my
news section hey we can move on to a new
segment that I just pulled out of my
butt moments before the show started
which is called would you rather what do
you rather would you rather it's super
original idea it's never been emulated
anywhere else in the world came up with
never have I ever no not quite but maybe
well there I think there is an actual
game like a board game or tabletop game
called would you rather which I think is
stupid maybe it's a video game I don't
know but anyway this is different
because it's it's us and it's a tech
it's tech related and it's fun it's
better okay thank you very much cell by
the way if you want to add any of these
strawpoll links in chat as we talk about
them one at a time so the first thing
that let me just set the segment up if
you if you are truly unfamiliar with
this concept there is a there's sort of
two scenarios and Paul and I can
determine there and discuss which
scenario we would rather be a part of
okay and there's truffles as well so you
guys can play along there's you know you
guys will look at the results after we
argue our sides so the first one is
would you rather Paul know everything
there is to know about tech and pcs
basically be like that an all-knowing
tech God okay you're omniscient or would
you rather be half robot with extra
strength and endurance capabilities kind
of similar to like a tan dog from Deus
Ex or something like that
hmm so it's kind of you know a human
improvement done in in different ways so
you don't have to answer right now I
always want to say like the one in the
second one here we
the mental versus the physical and then
we also have the second one here there's
four in total okay the second one is
would you rather give up gaming forever
you could never touch another game never
play another game mobile console pc ever
in your life or would you rather put
three live centipedes in your mouth for
10 minutes and if you just need a
refresher
what kind of centipede like the nasty
one like the nasty ones the one-minute
release there's some that are poisonous
and will kill you okay not poisonous so
you you wouldn't have any risk of dying
okay but what the grossest looking
centipede you can find on YouTube and
remember they even though they're not
poisonous they can still bite you and
sting you and and can be very very
painful so three of them in your mouth
live that's fake
this come that that's done it's not fake
I hope it's big and I hope you're right
oh rumba rumba vacuum you know I want to
have YouTube red oh my god oh no no
these are because we just been out that
a caterpillar that we found in the
farmers market who was rolling around on
a piece of cabbage he's very cute
caterpillars are adorable centipedes I
just said millipedes two or super cute
like a giant African millipede cutest
thing in the world
centipedes make you want to curl up in a
ball and die like I just want my please
shoot me on sight because 70 never even
touches my foot
hey is everyone ready okay is everyone
ready in oh yeah warning warning
explicit content it's coming your way
you might want to avert your eyes
oh so three it is that what we're
talking about for those no I mean
obviously you'd be the smaller ones that
can fit in your mouth that's CGI right
that's not real no that's so real
that's it's gonna kill him Oh God
kidding he's gonna die no way not
terrifying
he looks pretty horrible that's a bottom
Wow okay but see like that it's funny
because that that's a big centipede huge
Satish but it's relatively it's moving
relatively slow yeah if you look at the
like the little ones I could actually
fit in your mouth
they're super fast they're like that's
like this Chris were squirrely and stuff
that's good to know yeah see people are
freaking out already
Wow all right sorry oh sorry people edge
of the bed Oh God good so all right so
those are your options so again we have
gaming giving up gaming forever you
could never took another video game or
have three live centipedes in your mouth
for ten minutes just a one-time deal
let's say they just have to chill in
there you don't have to actually eat
them right yeah yeah I don't think
they're gonna chill they're probably
gonna fight each other and end up biting
the inside of your mouth several times
and I mean just imagine imagine some
kind of environment you set up in their
forum if they feel like they're safe
sure I'm pretty then maybe they'll just
hang out sure give them a put a couch in
your mouth but a mini couch and maybe a
little raspberry pie TV for
entertainment yes they'll totally chill
all right so should we go to the third
one nor should we circle back to the
first I don't know this is your signal
right let's go to the third let's go
through all right okay this is the third
one I thought this one was coming
interesting would you rather be able to
hack anyone's personal devices at any
time or prevent anyone from ever hacking
a personal device again not my personal
device but any personal device prevent
Iran from ever hacking and in any
forever yes
so no one's privacy would ever be
invaded or you could invade anyone's
privacy ever so I already know the
answer to that one okay that's probably
the wrong answer probably and it's
definitely sort of the angels versus
devil on your shoulder and then secondly
although maybe not entirely and then and
then finally I should say would you
rather this is the last one there's a
kicker would you rather lose both your
testicles in a galaxy note explosion or
make
with your grandma for an hour straight
once a year these are the questions that
need been asked in perpetuity in
perpetuity throughout forever and the
universe what if my grandma's or or or a
similar family member
simply if you can't if the grandmother
doesn't apply then just replace her with
some other some other comparable family
member that would be equally
uncomfortable okay I get what you're
going for so there's no necrophilia
necrophilia no oh no no she would have
to be it would have to be a living
family member okay yes which i think is
worse all right so let's look so let's
go to the first one here Paul would you
rather know everything there is to know
about tech and PCs and be a tech God and
know everything or would you rather be
half badass robot
well my first instinct was to go with
the extra strength and endurance
abilities because I feel like that's
something that you know you could just
have versus with tech and pcs you know
you can work individually to gain that
knowledge over time so I feel like
option a is something that you could
work towards and do on your own and rez
up should be is something that's kind of
like here you get this and you wouldn't
have had it otherwise sure however I
don't want to introduce you know half
human again it's just it's too much to
deal with so I'll go it's optional you
don't want to introduce half human what
I want to know it's not to be to be half
robot robot yes half robot oh that's
what I meant to say sure all right
I have human all right oh oh I think I
told you guys or you seen on people -
people think oh yeah let's see what
people think well as for know everything
there is yeah ok close you chose you
chose wisdom over strength I'm proud of
you more people going for the I am proud
of you for the wisdom I probably would
have chose half
but the same reason that you chose Paul
that that you can just sort of learn on
your own accord mmm
and it would be good like defense
mechanism to be half robot you know if
you ever in trouble it could save your
life although I guess knowing
information about tech and PCs could
save your life - if like a guy come up
to you with the gun do your headers like
what soon
you know last generation of Intel
processors what was the price of the
8,400 I don't know it happens to me a
lot so yeah it could be either way
either way it could be a life saver
the nice thing about the robot thing
though is like to the whole little plug
thing that pops out like like in Star
Wars in plugs in computer system it's me
a little bit and then you can hack it
and see where the prisoners are kept in
every one I'd be cool that's that's nice
it's convenient yeah all right all right
next up we have would you rather give up
gaming forever or put three live
centipedes in your mouth for 10 minutes
you know I was gonna say the centipedes
until we we watched the video you gotta
watch the video I'm gonna no we're not
talking about that kind of centipede
though so I you know I'm gonna go
centipedes centipedes no no god it is
brief of for a brief amount of pain oh
you know I had this idea in my head that
when I get older and I have more free
time like I had more free time I feel
like when I was younger I there it was
either more free time or I was just less
responsible about my time I met this
idea that as a you get older like I
might have more free time again as I
move towards retirement and stuff like
that yep
and I want to play more video games like
there's a lot of video games I'd love to
play you know I just I can't yeah you
know usually make money doing that or
everything so that's alright that's
where I'm at that's where I I have a bug
thing I don't I don't like bugs I can't
do it I read the creepiest post on
reddit the other day about a guy who who
that's his thing like he eats bugs
willingly yeah I was like on the
confession read it so like without an
audience he just yeah like like he says
nobody knows he does it he's done it
ever since he was however long ago
he describes various bugs that he's
eaten well this is a shoo-in for him
busy I was kind of Airy creepy yeah turn
that into some sort of money-making
habit I don't know yeah no I I'm gonna
give up games forever I can't and ten
minutes of centipede in my mouth is
forever well I would feel like people
are very dedicated to the game 61% going
with the peds
no the peds can't do it I'm not mentally
strong yeah kind of much the peds okay
no games worth it alright and then a
third one is would you be able to hack
anyone's personal devices or prevent
anyone from ever hacking your personal
device again now that what I thought
when I when I heard this was well it's
either a good or bad if you if you want
to hack anyone's devices you're bad if
you prevent anyone from hacking it
you're good but maybe not necessarily
what if you're hacking a abled person's
devices and can help authorities locate
or track them down to save lives
potentially you know it's kind of like a
tool that can be used if we're good or
even if you're white hat do you want the
tool to exist so that you could use it
for for good or do you just want the
tool to not exist whatsoever so that bad
guys can't use it but then also good
guys can't use it either I think this is
a privacy issue and I think people are
entitled to privacy and I don't think
I'm entitled to see anyone else's
private private stuff so I would go with
option B yeah prevent anyone from
hacking this is this is the equivalent
of like being able to read a person's
mind which i think is like the worst
superpower ever because it would drive
you insane if you wanted to make it less
good-versus-evil it should be prevent
anyone from ever hacking your personal
device ever again mmm-hmm in that case
it would be a very self a person very
weird more selfish selfish this decision
short and I'd still go with option B
yeah because I don't want anyone asking
me I'd suck true hey results meant
alright
6040 yep alright that seems that's about
that's about the split I would I would
expect from our alrighty and systems to
y'all stand up citizens and finally
would you rather lose both
testicles in the galaxy no explosion or
make out with your grandma for an hour
straight once a year I I'm already
married so it doesn't matter if I lose
my testicles just means that we wouldn't
be able to have kids we go as adopt the
scar like I would be kind of traumatized
from the explosion itself and having to
recover from that mentally but I think
it'd be more scarred mentally from
having to make it on my grandma yeah so
but you know grandma's years are limited
she's not gonna be around for a whole
lot you know like like forever you said
it was in perpetuity well until
perpetuity until it's not no longer
possible well in that case I meant your
evidence I mean I don't have any living
grandmother's so okay I choose option B
because then it's just already done with
I don't even have to worry okay 20 years
let's say you're hypothetically your
grandma was around for 20 more years
okay okay you can you get to pick the
grandma - oh well that's get to choose
the hot one you I would go with option A
here just because I really don't want
option B at all and similar to you I am
married I have a dog you already have a
kid so it's you know no plans for more
yeah so don't need the needle balls in
him don't need him you know I would
request some anesthesia before the
galaxy note explosion took my balls but
save me I'm sure they'll save me some
shaving time can I assume that it's a
localized explosion in just the balls
just just least a full use of right okay
it's not like an AoE type type deal and
that's still highly contained yeah oh no
it would be it would be like the most
excruciating painful event of your life
so all right here we go
not to be overlooked yeah people fassold
really don't want to make out with their
grandma that's good I think is
appropriate I think thank you most of
our this means that most of our viewers
are fairly healthy in the mind and about
a third of them what the hell is wrong
with you probably like oh I thought
you'd never ask
okay alright so that was would you
rather the great sick pine this was
bringing educational content let's
survive and you again what you put in
the in the lower thirds the choice
between cake and pie I thought that was
there was no better no better option
good I'm just saying as a representation
of what the question is worried it's
very much like it might be slightly
slightly easier to yes
all right we're you that's it stunning
half an hour episode good times so I
guess at this point we are gonna have an
after-party
if you guys want to follow the link in
the video description go ahead and check
that out I'm about to set of life right
now he goes I can send the P pops up
again
Jesus yeah so I'm gonna set the video
live for the after-party which should be
set by breath now and we're gonna answer
your questions that you attach to any
donations as well as read off johnson
shoutouts if you picked up something
from our stores start ten to seven oh
eight seven oh eight seven oh eight nine
a.m.
alright we'll see in a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
