recording how's it going guys welcome
back let me show you this monitor this
monitor I've had for a while this is the
asus rog swift key g3 for 8q when it
first launched in 2016 it was just about
the best gaming monitor that you could
buy on the market with it's 34 40 by
1440 21 by 9 ultra wide resolution a
hundred Hertz and gsync it was no wonder
this thing was priced at around 1,300
bucks when it first launched I've been
using this monitor for a couple years
now it's amazing - game on but why am I
talking about this panel that's nearly 2
years old now well just yesterday a
brand spankin new 2019 gaming monitor
arrived on my doorstep and this thing
looks so good on paper and it's been
getting so many positive reviews that it
actually threatens to replace this panel
as my primary gaming display so that's
what we're doing today we're gonna see
if the PG 3 4 8 Q retains its throne or
if it stays on my main gaming desk are
finally over now where did I put that
monitor it's not here ok I think it's in
the garage
let's go to the garage here LG this is
the LG ultra gear 3 for gk 9 5 0 f 34
inches free sync - this is great because
we now get support for AMD and geforce
cards that are Maxwell architecture or
later so that definitely makes this
panel a bit more attractive whether
you're going team red or team green on
the graphics side of things 144 Hertz
this is what I'm most excited about and
what could very well tip the scales in
LG's favor for me because our rog swift
monitor maxes out at a hundred hertz and
since hotline 2 is gonna be my primary
gaming desktop and it's just an absolute
beast with a 99 hundred k and dual
twenty ATT is in sli you're gonna easily
blow past the 100 frames per second mark
in the majority of titles at 34 40 by 14
40s it's like a walk in the park so 144
Hertz is definitely appealing and
standing out to me as a notable feature
over my current display nano IPS this
refers to LG's own nano cell technology
it's their own take on IPS have reviewed
a couple TVs using the same technology
very sharp wide viewing angles and that
sort of thing
we've got HDR and a bunch of other bells
and whistles on this thing that we'll
explore in a moment so let's get this
guy in the house and we'll take her out
of the box alright open this guy up I
should mention that this is currently
selling on Amazon for
eleven hundred and fifty bucks us
there's also a g-sync version of this
exact panel and it looks to be about
fifty bucks cheaper on Amazon but it's a
little bit more expensive on Newegg that
being said it's using an older jisuk
module actually the same one I think
that's in the my rog swift panel so it
only supports up to 100 Hertz whereas
the freesync 2 version that we have here
again 144 ok these are accessories Oh
what is this stand the base of the stand
Oh big foam coming in rest of the stand
and the big daddy himself oh yeah don't
drop anything else yeah see that's all
folks thin bezel actually all the bezels
are uniform they're all thin and black
whereas our rog swift has a bit of a
prominent chin it's a different color
it's great doesn't look bad but it
certainly looks cleaner here on the LG
panel some other tidbits about this
panel while I clean up here it is
featuring a DCI p3 98% color space which
is actually wider than the ROG panel
which I believe is 100% srgb stand is
super thin and light but also looks to
be pretty sturdy I guess will verify
that once the panels on poulos
completely tool is just snaps on haha
all right so you've got height tilt and
swivel adjustment the other thing I like
about this stand is that it's just sort
of this V shape as opposed to the sort
of Y footing on the pg3 4 eq which means
you kind of have to like I can put this
monitor really far back without too much
problem but I can't do the same thing on
the PG 3 for 8 Q I actually have to
bring it up quite a bit so that it's
middlefoot that's sticking out straight
back doesn't hang over the edge and the
whole monitor goes toppling over so just
on the stand alone this might be a
better option if you're dealing with a
more narrow desk that's not as deep and
the curvature on this thing is actually
much more aggressive than on the rog
swift panel you get an 1800 hour curve
here compared to 3800 are on the rog
swift and it is very noticeable how much
more curvaceous this guy is look at the
i/o here you've got two USB 3.0
downstream and one USB 3.0 upstream port
DisplayPort that's of course if you want
to take advantage of free sync -
although I believe you could probably
also use one of these HDMI ports
assuming one of them is HDMI 2.0 to take
advantage of that as well headphone jack
and DC power just like the PG three for
EQ now this isn't for everyone but I
really like how the ports are
exposed here and there very accessible
whereas on the PG three for aq there is
a cover plate that just sort of covers
all the ports and stuff for a cleaner
look I don't think most people care what
the back of the screen looks like they'd
rather be able to get to ports easily
even with that cover plate removed I
don't even have it installed because
it's just a nuisance the ports on that
rog swift monitor are kind of still
recessed much more than this and they're
actually facing upward so you have to
sort of fish around go underneath and up
to find the various inputs and outputs
so definitely like the design choice a
bit more on the ultra gear one thing I
could do without on this panel
aesthetically are the red accents I
would prefer to be color neutral like my
rog swift panel but being said most of
the red accents if not all of them in
fact are sort of facing the back side of
the panel so when you're looking at dead
on you can hardly see any red I mean the
most noticeable area is probably the the
base of the stand that's only if you're
looking at it from a steep angle or
something like that but it's worth
noting in case you're going for a very
specific look for your setup and people
are gonna be able to see the back of
your display all right let's fire this
thing up alright so I've got the monitor
hooked up to hot line I just did a clean
install of Windows 10 but we're a bit
we're on hold for now because I got to
wait for Windows updates to finish we
need to wait for this to finish before
we can install the GeForce drivers so in
the meantime there are a couple things
that I forgot to mention about the
monitor up until this point for starters
base amount if you don't like the stand
you want a wall mount if for whatever
reason you can remove the stand entirely
and there's 100 by 100 millimeter base
amount on the back of the display also
let's take a quick look at the OSD was a
little joystick here you would think the
joystick would be right in the middle of
the monitor but it's actually offset
just ever so slightly to the left and
then you've got a couple of simple
options here power input power input oh
oh it's a little it's a little finicky
the joysticks a little sensitive
definitely not as intuitive as the the
Auris monitor that I reviewed not too
long ago so you've got game mode this is
just sort of quick on the fly between
different profiles you got your FPS RTS
the gamer profiles are customizable and
you can also tap into settings here a
bunch of more options pop up I kind of
like this at a glance look at your main
settings just so you can see it really
quick and you can see we've also got
some more settings right here that
weren't available to us on the sort of
on the flying menu that we just saw and
you've got a game adjust section with
free sync so you've got basic extended
black stabilizer response time which you
can change depending on how much emotion
is going to be on screen speaking of
response time this is a one millisecond
panel but that's with the help of
motion blur reduction so it's
technically probably closer into four or
five maybe six milliseconds in reality
because it's an IPS display IPS displays
are just not known as being quite as
fast as TN panel for example even though
they have much higher color reproduction
but with the help of motion blur
reduction you get a seemingly faster and
more responsive panel what else is in
here there's oh there's crosshairs you
can put the crosshair let's see okay so
you got an exit the OSD for it to apply
by so it's just baked into the monitor
doesn't take up any system resources and
it's it's basically an overlay so you'll
be able to have a little cheating
crosshair in pretty much any game or
application you need picture adjusts
some standard settings here nothing too
fancy and lastly if you're not in the
OSD at all that you move the joystick
left or right you can adjust the
headphone volume assuming you have that
plugged in or brightness if you want to
go up and down on the joystick so but
that's it for the OSD it's super
straightforward no frills
it's obviously not as easy to use or as
intuitive as the Auris monitor that I
checked out which basically functions as
a Windows 10 desktop app that you can
interface with keyboard mouse and stuff
but it gets the job done it's pretty
standard of what you'd find on a gaming
display here in 2019 our Windows updates
looking 59 it's hardly moved since we
started filming this bit it's ridiculous
what's taking so long
I man hate your windows ok video drivers
are installed we can play some games but
firsts already went to the OSD and
enabled free sync not in the Nvidia
control panel gonna switch over to a
hundred and forty-four Hertz thank you
very much
uh-huh yeah that's the stuff yeah let's
play again so right off the bat colors
be a pop in yo it's looking real mass
very vibrant rich color definitely
thanks to the nano cell technology from
LG as well as the DCI p3 98% color space
it's looking really good whoo Oh what
was that
is that the game it was cutting out and
turned in black first flip second I'm
assuming that's the game and hopefully
not my very expensive gaming PC or the
monitor itself ok I just want to stay in
the greener parts of the map because it
just looks really pretty
very responsive superfast monitor holy
moly getting some weird artifacts here I
don't know if you guys can tell but
there's some weird stuff going on right
here that part of the screen not sure if
that's the the GPU or the game I'll have
to look into that later yeah boy oh shit
what alright so I backed out of Apex
legends because I just want to see if
the black screen issue that we were
encountering persists and sure enough it
does it's still happening so it's not
the title I think it's gotta have
something to do with GeForce hardware
using a free sync display free sync is
still enabled in the OSD and gsync is
enabled within into the control panel it
does say right here that the selected
display is not validated as g-sync
compatible so maybe there's some issue
there it's not really playing nicely for
whatever reason but I'm gonna try
something else I'm gonna switch us to
120 Hertz here because maybe there's
just a certain peak of g-sync slash free
sync support here before any sort of
issues arise let's jump back in to Apex
alright so it's been about 5 minutes and
no black screens whatsoever it seems
like the problem is completely fixed
which leads me to believe that 120 Hertz
is the most you can get out of this
panel if you happen to be using geforce
cards and you want to take advantage of
adaptive refresh rate AKA free sync in
this case all right I've had enough of
you Apex let's jump into a different
game how about some car lumps so the
black screen is gone now but we have
these weird lines still here
these were around in apex as well it's
really kind of weird not exactly sure
what's going on gotta kill these guys
first alright so let's try to figure out
what's going on there this is sort of
turned into a semi troubleshooting video
I'm gonna back out and see if we can
figure out what's causing those weird
lines okay so I have an update
I ran ddu reinstall the GeForce drivers
the problem still persists so then I
switched over to the I GPU I actually
plug the display cable into the
motherboard itself so we're running from
the integrated graphics on the 9900 Kay
and still the lines are there so it has
nothing to do with the GPUs or the
GeForce drivers and then I realized if I
have this app in windowed mode and I
slide it over the lines disappear it's
apparently only visible when the
application is overlapping this part of
the screen really weird behavior so
leads me to believe that we may have a
defect
monitor it doesn't keep me from
continuing on with the video but it is a
bit disappointing especially because I
was I was getting ready to swap out my
rog swift panel for this one it was
looking really good up until this moment
right now because this is this is not
this is just not gonna fly this is
unusable I don't really see the lines
unless there's a 3d application open but
I do see some weird artifacting on the
taskbar yeah there's there's definitely
something funky going on with with the
LG panel here and I guess there's
nothing we can do except carry on with
the video I guess we'll jump into one
more game let's do shadow of the tomb
Raider's it's also an HDR game so I'm
gonna go ahead and enable HDR on the
panel as well and then we have to go
into our Windows display settings
windows HD color and play HDR games and
apps we're gonna enable that and
remember when you enable this it really
only benefits you when you actually feed
the panel HDR supported content you
shouldn't just enable this and go browse
the web or use your desktop willy-nilly
otherwise the colors aren't going to be
balanced or it might look a little
washed out like it does right now all
right I was just rolling around on the
game for a few minutes here and I
grabbed some screenshots some with HDR
on some with it off and I made sure to
be in the same position so we get a nice
apples to apples comparison so we've got
our first side-by-side here no HDR on
the left
HDR enabled on the right and right off
the bat it's much brighter with HDR on
that's not necessarily a good thing
though some people still might prefer
the look of HDR disabled because just
because it's brighter doesn't mean the
contrast is better the image just looks
a little bit blown out it's almost too
bright and somewhat blinding especially
like if you look at the dead bodies on
the ground there they look overexposed
in my opinion and I think a lot of
people would prefer the look of HDR
disabled even though the colors don't
necessarily pop it's a bit more
natural-looking I don't think the HDR
implementation on this panel is really
what people think of when they think of
really good HDR mainly because it
doesn't have local dimming like a lot of
true HDR televisions have they're really
handicaps the panel's HDR capabilities
and keeps it from having a much more
dynamic contrast and a wider range of
color once again in our second pair of
screenshots you can see that it's much
brighter on the right with HDR than it
is on the left but again when you're
looking at the reflections of the Sun in
the water in the stream that's below
lara croft it's just it's it's pretty
blown out so again it's brighter but it
kind of falls short of a true
you are experienced in my opinion now
this last example is probably the best
showcase for the HDR implementation in
this panel and for the game itself for
that matter because we're looking at the
Sun now which is supposed to be a really
bright object so it plays well with the
HDR effect here that just tends to be
overly hot in general whereas without
HDR it looks very dull and boring so you
know I think the HDR experience on this
display is going to depend partly on the
type of content that you feed it but
also without local dimming built into
the display at a hardware level you're
just not going to get that same dynamic
contrast or really wide range of colors
that you might see in an HDR demo for
example on the show floor of CES because
I've seen those demos and they are
freaking mind-blowing like true HDR with
local dimming is really a sight to
behold this is not it this is a bit
underwhelming and further validates that
gaming panels have a long way to go when
it comes to true HDR support alright
we're gonna close the video out with
some doom because it's a super fast
paced shooter which is really gonna take
advantage of the higher fresh right here
and we can you can see we're soaring
past the 144 Hertz mark this monitor
just moves so fast and it stays really
smooth while doing so I definitely say
this is the best gaming monitor that
LG's ever made hands down and to be
honest the only thing keeping me from
swapping out the ROG monitor for this
one is the fact that we have those
stupid artifact lines that are just kind
of ruining the game I did confirm that
it is the the panel I plugged in the
completely different system and the
lines are still there so it's definitely
the monitor I looked online to see if
anyone had a similar issue with this
display I could not find any recurring
instances so that's good at least and
for the record I should mention that
it's completely impractical and unfair
of me to compare this display to the PG
three for aq simply because that panel
came out like two years ago at the same
time that Asus display has been my
primary gaming monitor for a couple
years now so I guess it's a relevant
comparison for me anyway the other thing
is that they're not too far off in price
904 the rog swift versus eleven hundred
and fifty these are approximations at
the time of filming but for the money i
would say you get more bang for your
buck going with the LG display assuming
it's not defective get a more aggressive
curve if you're into that sort of thing
higher refresh rate freesync support so
it can actually be used with AMD and
gpus a wider color gamut and a smarter
stand in my opinion that just is
designed a bit more practically as far
as downsides ago I would say the HDR
experience isn't quite as impressive as
you might want it to be and not everyone
is gonna be a fan of the black and red
color scheme there's also competing
displays out there that have more
sophisticated OSDs with a lot more
features than this one but that being
said this is again the best gaming
display I've ever seen LG put on the
market so props to them for that I'm
looking forward to seeing what they do
next guys thank you for watching this
video I'm actually just gonna continue
playing games I don't want to edit just
yet
so thank you for watching if you enjoyed
it toss a like on the video before you
go get subscribed and all that Jess you
don't miss any more videos coming up
really soon and I'll see you guys in the
next video goodbye
