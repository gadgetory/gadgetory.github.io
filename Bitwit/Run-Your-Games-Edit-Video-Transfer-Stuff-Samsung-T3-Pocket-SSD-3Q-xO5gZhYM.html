Samsung for a review sample of their one
terabyte t3 external SSD a few weeks
later the drive showed up at my doorstep
but was immediately placed on the back
burner while my attention shifted to the
RX 480 and gtx 1060 launches now even
though i'm just getting around to
posting my review of the t3 i've
actually been using it daily since the
date arrived
needless to say my other drives have
been extra jelly especially this one
that fell into a jar of jelly like it's
critically-acclaimed predecessor the t1
this revamped pocket SSD works with
Windows Mac and Android devices and
comes in variants of 250 gig 500 gig one
terabyte and two terabyte capacities at
370 dollars USD the one terabyte model
Curly goes 4.4 to $5 a gig right now the
one terabyte 850 Evo goes for just 0.314
dollars a gig which is twice the rate
most DJ's should be making per gig but
if you're looking for a speedy external
storage solution the t3 packs in some
nice features that an internal SSD being
used as an external device simply does
not have for starters with a weight of
51 grams and dimensions of just 78 by
fifty eight by ten and a half
millimeters the t3 is super compact and
makes other SSD enclosures seem bulky in
comparison for being so small the drive
feels surprisingly durable with its
two-tone metal casing and internal frame
that's shock resistant up to 1500 G's
not those G's apart from a blue activity
light the only thing you'll find around
the enclosure is a type-c connector
supporting USB 3.1 gen2 which is rated
for 10 gigabits per second speeds USB
3.1 genuine is a slight iteration of USB
3.0 and retains its theoretical transfer
rate of five gigabits per second
what's that Jimmy that's a USB 3.1 Drive
you've got right next you'll probably
tell me that's a hoverboard you're on it
would have been nice to have actual Gen
2 10 gigabits per second support here
but I suppose I'll wait to run the
benchmarks before making a big fuss
the included type C to type a cable
measures 18 inches or 45 centimeters
long which leaves enough slack for
plugging in behind your desktop but
stays short enough to wrap quickly with
the included velcro strap as many of you
know one of the great triumphs of type C
connectors is that they're reversible so
there's never a need to double check the
orientation of your cable or connector
before plugging in finding the hole is
the only goal to ensure that any
sensitive files that you may have
the driver mein private the t-3 can also
be password protected using AES 256-bit
encryption on the Box Samsung claims a
sequential read and write transfer speed
of 450 megabytes per second which puts
it in the same league as modern SATA
based SSDs I quickly verified these
numbers using a toe disk mark and found
a sequential read and write of 463 and
444 megabytes per second respectively
showing speeds closer to or greater than
the advertised specs like any good
politician theoretical numbers only tell
us half the story so to gauge real-world
performance I first ran some transfer
speed tests with the drive plugged into
the USB 3.1 port of my Asus x99
sabertooth in hot line here it's
important to note that the t3 also
supports you ASP a USB protocol that
boosts data throughput so I made sure to
enable this option in AI suite 3
throughout our testing now to give us a
frame of reference for how well the t3
performs we needed some competition so I
rounded up two other common types of
external drive solutions weighing in we
have a fairly basic 32 gig Kingston
DataTraveler USB 3.0 flash drive and a
512 gig a data SX 902 and a half inch
SATA 3 SSD that I've mounted inside this
hyper X external USB 3.0 enclosure a
scandalous affair that would likely
disappoint both their parents to see how
these drive stack up let's have a look
at our first write speed test which was
a 10 gigabyte folder containing all the
game files for Metro last light as we
can see the t3 and SX 900 finish the
transfer in the exact same time of 61
seconds while the thumb drive takes
twice as long next I tried a larger game
folder with hitman absolution and saw
the a data SSD edged out the t3 by 13
seconds making it around 6 percent
faster again our poor flash drive gets
crushed by the SSDs taking 162 percent
longer to write the files
our next test involved writing a large
batch of pictures taken with my samsung
galaxy s6 most of them are shots of me
eating watermelon while staring at a
kilowatt again the USB 3 Drive falls way
behind both SSDs and the SX 900 manages
to shave 9 seconds off of the t3 time
although just when it seems the t3 is
always one step behind things get
interesting once we try writing
different types of incompressible data
when moving a single 4 gig video file we
see the table suddenly turn in Samsung's
favor by nearly cutting the SX 900 s
time in half and performing 3 times
faster than the data traveler to vary
by these results in a more extreme
scenario I proceeded to write eighty
eight gigs of incompressible video files
to the two SSDs the results were
consistent as we saw the t3 take 34%
less time than the SX 900 which saved us
about two and a half minutes precious
time that was used to make love to my
wife quality over quantity my friends
from the numbers we're seeing it appears
the pocket SSD shines brightest when
handling incompressible data which just
so happens to be what's often used in
video editing so to put the drive
through its paces I fired up Adobe
Premiere Pro and tried working with some
4k footage straight off of the t3
surprisingly everything from previewing
clips to scrubbing through the timeline
proved to be very fluid regular playback
and shuttling through the footage at
full quality proven effortless tasks
with no stuttering or dropped frames
seeing this for myself I couldn't help
but ask why couldn't all my trips to the
bathroom go too smoothly at any rates
the ability to use the drive as an
editing disk via USB instantly gives the
t3 more purpose than simply moving files
from A to B making it an incredibly
useful device when editing on the go now
in most cases a terabyte of storage is
plenty for video editing but it's also
ample room for storing your games
library of course you'll only make the
most of this if the drive itself is fast
enough to let you run those games off of
it so for our final test I installed
origin in Crysis 3 on the t3 to see what
kind of gaming experience we could
expect because frankly the client
experience sucks no matter which drive
it's on gaming on my x99 testbed with
mac settings at quad HD load times were
snappy and my entire playthrough was
smooth to the point where the game might
as well have been running off of my PC's
internal SSD the drive did get
moderately warm but you'll probably need
a 950 pro if you want to fry some eggs
running games via a USB connection could
make a lot of sense for laptop users who
don't have enough internal storage or if
you just want to hijack every PC you
come across to see if it can run Crysis
after using the t3 for the past month or
two I found that it has a lot to offer
in nearly every aspect of an external
drive speed portability build quality
and security if I have to leave one
category out here its affordability
since the t3 does come at a notably
higher dollar per gig than most SATA
based SSDs with that premium however
comes a truly compact design the type C
convenience factor and rapid speeds that
give way to versatility and time saving
if your computer supports USB 3.1 and
you're in the market for a new external
drive don't let the price alone keep you
from picking
one of these up it's honestly the best
external drive I've used since I can
remember and I think it's worth every
penny but let me know what you guys
think of this thing in the comments and
don't forget to toss me a like on this
