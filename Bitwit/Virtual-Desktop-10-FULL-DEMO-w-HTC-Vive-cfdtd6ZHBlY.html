this is a new initiative so many domain
names haven't been taken yet that's why
I was able to score awesomesauce Tech
before any of you guys could snag it
first and try selling it to me later
trolls go check it out I put a link in
the description ok bye what's up guys
welcome back to the channel today I am
taking a look at virtual desktop 1.0 and
this is a really cool app in my opinion
that's a must-have if you own either an
HTC vive or an oculus rift it's
compatible with both just simply because
it really expands the functionality and
what you can do to interface with your
desktop when using a VR headset and of
course you can already go into your
desktop in a virtual world using steam
VR so steam VR has a free desktop mode
but it's severely limited in what it can
do pretty much you're limited to a flat
screen that's really too close to your
face it's almost like being at a movie
theater and sitting in the front row and
there's really not much else you can do
outside of that realm for now so I'm
going to be going over some of the
basics on what you can do in this
amazing application it's only 15 bucks
on Steam at first I was like that's kind
of pricey and after I actually pulled
the trigger and started playing around
with it realize it's completely worth
every penny so let's go ahead and just
give you guys a brief rundown on what
you can do so right now you're seeing
what I'm seeing in the virtual desktop
application
you can see right off the bat my screen
is curved something that steamvr cannot
do natively and I'm also in space space
is pretty cool this is kind of trippy
actually and this is one of the free
backgrounds that you can switch between
in the application so you've also got
deep space looks like we're kind of
sitting in front of Saturn or some other
ringed planet at the moment we've also
got purple nebula and then there's also
star fielders there's a bunch of little
stars floating around us it's the
keeping us company and stuff a couple
other free environments that you get
here are the photo studio which I guess
they're taking pictures of these robots
over here it's it's pretty cool and then
you've also got sunrise this is probably
what my what my wife would switch to
because it's the
scary she's she's scared of space but
there's also a couple more that you can
buy in the environment store that's
that's in steam and you can purchase
those for anywhere from $1 to $3 this is
the Cerebrus of cerebral Theatre
cerebral Theatre pretty much where
Professor Xavier goes to you know read
minds and so this is really cool
you can see right now the screen the
screen is curved and tilted kind of
above me so this would be great for like
leaning back in your chair you know
reclining in your chair and watching
movies and things like that some some
environments you cannot scale though the
developer has blocked it so it's pretty
much what you see is what you get but I
think it's a pretty good distance at
least for me for my taste and you've
also got a cinema screen which is
another one I think this was a $2.00
environment and it's looking a little
lonely in here but it's a really cool
feeling it really feels like you're at
the movie theater again that the screen
is kind of tilted upward it's flat this
time you cannot curve it it's just just
like a movie screen would be and yeah it
says it's a really cool really cool
feature home theater I think is one that
comes with virtual desktop 1.0 I think
this just comes stock this is a freebie
I'll look looks like you're in more of a
home theater and it's also pretty cool
the screen is quite a bit smaller than
the cinema screen but still pretty sweet
and then we've got rick's garage this is
probably my favorite and i don't know
why i'm not sitting in front of my desk
right now but usually i'm sitting in
front of my monitor but yeah you can see
this is just a more traditional curved
screen looks like an Acer predator is on
my desk and really cool artwork all
around it's just a give you a nice
little atmosphere to work in if you so
choose now I will say though when you're
when I'm looking at this particular
virtual screen and it's this close and
it's and it's about this size it's a
little bit difficult to see smaller text
or icon simply because you're shrinking
the native resolution so small that it
looks kind of shimmery and it's hard to
pick out little details so I wouldn't
recommend working in this type of
environment as cool as it is watching
movies and stuff is fine but not doing
any actual productive work I'd probably
advise against that
let me give you guys a quick little demo
on watching
movie in the cerebral theater it's it's
pretty badass I'm gonna fire up some
kung fury here I don't know if you guys
can hear that but we're gonna put these
on oh yeah it's coming through
all right so having all these different
backgrounds and whatnot is pretty cool
however I think more importantly is the
ability to scale the monitor well again
I can't do it in this environment we'll
go back to Dark Nebula here so the
ability to kind of just bring the
monitor either as close to you as you
want or far the hell away is an
invaluable feature and probably the most
important tool in this application but
here you go you've also got screen
distance which kind of pulls the screen
apart it kind of gives you the illusion
of either having this massive screen or
a smaller screen that's really close to
you so right now at the very lowest it
feels like it's like maybe a thirty inch
screen in front of my face and as soon
as I crank it all the way up the screen
physically hasn't gotten much bigger
it's just it's oriented in such a way
where it feels now like a 20-foot screen
it's it's kind of hard to explain you
just had to be there guys just had to be
there as for screen options you do have
the option to curve the screen as it is
now or you can make it completely flat
and then in that case you're probably
going to want to push the screen a
little bit further away from you I
actually prefer the curved I really do
just because it's it feels more natural
in a vr space where everything is kind
of curved around you in spherical it
looks kind of awkward when it's just a
flat screen so I do prefer the curved
it's really great that you have that
feature here there's also multi-monitor
support so if you have a second physical
monitor connected to your system you can
actually display that in the VR
environment and it'll just appear right
to the you know just adjacent to your
primary display and you can orient them
you can you know have your primary
display straight in front of you and
then your your second monitor to the
right of you or you can kind of
reposition it so that you're looking
straight in between both your monitors
and there's also this reset orientation
option here so basically based on where
you're looking you can click that button
and your your whole virtual monitor will
actually reset to the position you're
facing so that's kind of cool if you
want to like be computing while you're
laying down in bed you can just do that
and now all of a sudden or if you want
to watch a movie in bed while while
looking straight up at the ceiling you
can just do that click reset orientation
and it'll be right there
so floating essentially just tilts your
screen upwards a little bit kind of like
how we saw in the cerebral Theatre we're
just kind of tilted your screen upwards
it's just really quick witted do that if
you want to again recline in your chair
while while using your system
there's also clear wallpaper and if you
make it transparent you can see straight
through your desktop into the the
virtual environment behind which is a
pretty cool feeling of course all your
your desktop icons are still there you
can also just have a regular black
background for your desktop as well all
right we've also got some audio options
here including voice command support so
you can essentially tell the application
to do any of these basic commands so
switching to different tabs you can
reset the orientation showing or
launching games straight from the
application returning to desktop from
your game or asking what time it is so
what time is it what time is it current
time is 9:41 a.m. you're damn right it's
9:40 1 a.m. switch to bindings reset
orientation awesome stuff okay so you
got voice commands there you can change
the accuracy level of it say use a lower
value if it doesn't recognize what
you're saying use a higher value if it
picks up commands incorrectly so based
on how well it's receiving your commands
you can adjust that and maybe get some
better feedback there's also a vocal
feedback which is kind of like windows
narrator environment sounds let's go
ahead and check that on now we've got
some environment sounds for our various
environments so it starts with an intro
chime anytime you start a new startup a
new environment gives you kind of an
introductory some of them give you an
introductory audio audio cue but then
you've just got some ambient noise I
don't know how well you can hear it but
it just kind of sounds like we're in
this big scary metal ball because we are
pretty cool I would turn that off if you
you know want to watch movies and stuff
so it doesn't interfere you've also got
these let me switch back to one of these
face ones also got side by side options
so an example of this would be side by
side content so you know if you ever
watch a YouTube video and it's even it's
got that split it's like meant to be 3d
and it's like
we got two images one for your left eye
one for your right eye they look pretty
similar like they're almost duplicates
but they're not and then it's only when
you actually have a programmer
application to put them together do you
see this like 360 or this kind of 3d
image so let me go ahead and try to find
that right now all right so we've got
this side by side video from Sony just a
bunch of robots in space we'll go ahead
and check the on screen and then we'll
fullscreen the video and see what we see
all right so to me it just looks like
one single image
there's no splitting of the the two
images and I could see these robot guys
flying in here and it does look very 3d
um kind of a cool thing that you could
do
you're still in space as well so yeah
and if you could if you saw from the
actual YouTube video it's it's a
side-by-side image so it's actually
split so you can see it's two separate
images doesn't look anything like what I
was feeling when that side-by-side
option was enabled so pretty cool stuff
there's also other options depending on
if you're using a headset blah blah blah
I'm not going to go too into detail with
that windows integration so you can
mirror the headset mirror what the
headset is viewing to a window this is
exactly what I have up right here I just
have this open so I can capture it with
xsplit you can also do that mirror it to
a generic picture and picture monitor
you've also got force open VR which
forces the use of open VR when you're
using a rift for example you can show
error notifications start the program
when windows starts up also open VR
options so you can show chaperone
chaperone is the the blue grid or the
the gridlines that pop up anytime you're
near or approaching your boundaries that
you've set for your room scaling and
you've also got return to death return
to desktop
moving on to bindings you've got some
hotkey options here that you can
customize to do various simple tasks
like reducing the screen size resetting
the orientation things like that so
pretty cool stuff just helps you
navigate a little bit easier you also
have the option to launch games through
virtual desktop 1.0 however I wasn't
able to do so successfully I tried
rocket League
ta5 and counter strike and each one gave
me a problem rocket strike just straight
up wouldn't launch it just said failed
for some reason counter strike gave me
an alert that I was not launching the
game straight from Steam so it flagged
it as you know potential cheating or
whatever so I wasn't able to actually
play the game through this application
and then GTA 5 not necessarily virtual
desktops fault but for some reason I
couldn't log into Rockstar social it was
just giving me grief so I just said
screw it I don't know if this really
works or how well it works I tried three
different games failed every time
however once this gets patched up or
maybe in desparate all desktop 2.0 I
could see this being really useful
instead of having to always go back into
steam to launch your games 360 video or
I'm sorry 360 photo allows you to drag
and drop 360 or panoramic photos into
your virtual desktop library and then
from there you can just view them with
your VR headset so this is actually my
wedding this is my wedding reception
back in August of 2015
and this is before everyone came and
crashed the place but you can kind of
see a little bit of how it looked there
was the the reception or like the
ceremony area though the chairs and
stuff we had the reception in ceremony
kind of in the same spot but yeah it's
pretty cool my friend Ian actually took
this picture dirt on that day and I
asked him to send it to me so it's
pretty cool obviously there's some
distortion at the top and bottom of the
picture but it's pretty cool just being
able to relive certain moments this is
um let me get a better one here this was
our Hawaii trip maybe a year or two ago
we did some ATV riding this is actually
the same island where they shot a lot of
Jurassic Park the original Jurassic Park
not not Jurassic world but again really
really cool stuff okay bye honey this we
it's weird to kiss you and not and not
see you with my eyes open you look like
a cloud
alright now let's check out some 360
video playback you have the option of
pasting a URL like straight from YouTube
so if you go on YouTube search for a 360
video you can just straight up paste it
in really simple it'll automatically
download and start playing in the player
here I've already
got a couple of them open so there's
this uh roller coaster from Six Flags
Magic Mountain which I would not advise
anyone watching I'm not going to put
that put you guys through that right now
and we've got this really cool and from
Discovery BR and Mythbusters on a shark
shipwreck which is really cool
obviously like it's shot in 4k and it's
you can watch it in 4k on YouTube
however it does lose some quality in the
VR environment I'm not gonna say it's
super crisp or anything but Buster's it
is still very cool this is a demand note
how is that I don't you turn around you
won't see me because I'm not here I'm
just doing the narration behind that
diver who happens to be our executive
producer checking the place out prior to
our experiments you can see that
somewhat predictably the wreck is
guarded by a bunch of sharks so very
cool stuff I really really do like the
360 features in virtual desktop I think
they work really well assuming that you
have good content good high quality
footage to to feed it and I think that's
pretty much all I wanted to say about
this particular application obviously
highly recommend it to any user with the
VR headset just to expand the
functionality of your desktop and your
VR headset again not so great for
productive productivity purposes however
any kind of content or media playback I
think would be outstanding to to use
this in it's just a really cool way to
watch movies to experience TV shows on a
20 20 foot screen and things like that
it really is quite cool and just being
able to adjust you know your virtual
monitor properties is pretty key also uh
if I do have a critique or two for this
application it would be to have some
support for the vibe controller mouse
and keyboard functionality is really
good at the tracking super good
something that's not so hot in Steam vrs
desktop mode the mouse cursor is always
like flickering in and out and it's hard
to track with it so that's good but when
you're leaning back watching movies
you're kind of putting yourself further
away from your mouse so it would be nice
to also have the support for the HTC
vive controller where you could just
kind of pick it up almost like a remote
controller and pointed it around and you
know click on you know larger icons and
things as long as you're not trying to
like you know checkmark those boxes in
xsplit or something super tiny
the vibe controller should work fine for
that so it would have been nice to see
some support for that maybe in the
future also the Xbox 360 controller
maybe put some multimedia functionality
in some of those keys and some of those
buttons for that controller especially
when you're watching content like
YouTube videos just mix it for overall
easier viewing so just some critiques
there but overall great job to the guy
who made this again highly recommend and
hopefully you guys enjoyed getting a
gist of what it's all about so if you
did and you enjoyed it go ahead and toss
me a like on the video subscribe to the
channel for more tech videos coming in
the near future and until next time I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
