the channel hope you're all doing well
today I am taking a look at a family PC
that is hella hella old but I don't say
how it's you often so you know it's old
it's actually my aunt and uncle's family
rig it's an HP Pavilion let's see a 335
Deb yeah like that Windows XP holy moly
it's actually been in their household
for about 10 years or so maybe even more
it's a really old system and actually it
was a little bit dustier than you see it
now because I went in and already
cleaned up the heatsink it looked like
it couldn't even breathe on the CPU
cooler there so this is a really old
system if you want some basic specs I
only have basic specs the CPU is an
Intel Pentium 4 it's a single core 2.5
gigahertz with one gig of system memory
look at this I got two different dims in
here two different than I think the one
on the Left what the heatsink is like a
Super Talent a Super Talent SiC and then
there's just a basic PCB one on the
right those are each 512 megabytes ddr2
giving us a total of one gig of system
memory we'll wait and you know they are
just using the screen graphics there's
no I'm sorry integrated graphics there's
no discrete GPU we're going to do a
couple things today first off we're
going to try to boot into Windows
because according to my aunt they've
been having a hard time even getting
into Windows so I think that they
probably haven't been using this for the
last like a couple years maybe so we're
going to see if we get into Windows
first off and then second if we can do
that I'm going to try to clear out sort
of giving it give it a software detox if
you will where I sort of remove you know
all the malware or any sort of malicious
programs or applications or files that
may have accumulated or found their way
onto this system in the last ten years
or so and then finally the third
objective for today is going to is going
to be to see if this system is actually
usable after we clean it all out FB boot
into Windows after we give it a nice
little scrub down is it still usable for
day-to-day tasking I'm just talking
about basic stuff here browsing the web
watching videos on YouTube pretty much
the only things that my aunt uncle
entered and their kids are probably
going to use this for at any given time
but is it is it enough is a single core
CPU that's you know dated back almost
ten years now with one gig of system
memory is it enough we shall see ladies
and gentlemen but I think the first
thing we should do is try to turn the
damn thing on we've got our power cord
go ahead and plug it in here uh and and
the system just turns on by itself and
then it turns off okay let's try the
power button which is already kind of
recessed in an odd way but he thought
okay that works systems on looking good
oh wait it just turned off again it just
turned off again what's happening so
truth be told I was actually playing
around with this system a little bit
before I started recording the video and
I found out that the reason why the
system just keeps auto shutting down and
even auto powering on is because there's
probably a short with the front panel
connectors here as soon as you take this
out take that out go ahead and power it
on the old-fashioned way
with the screwdriver here all right
powered on and if all goes well oh jeez
oh look look at that we have a splash
screen look we just booted into Windows
woohoo we plug in a keyboard really
quick
funny story I didn't even have a VGA
cable on hand so I had to run to Best
Buy and buy one of these they're like
$18 freakin ripoff
all right so we're in the operating
system here that's our objective one is
already complete so first off I just
changed the resolution to 1920 by 1080
something that would not hurt my eyes
quite as much we've already got some
juicy stuff here like game channel music
for games PC accessory offers music
match jukebox easy internet sign up
where do i download that program sound
like a winner look at this look at the
tray icons oh yeah opening up the task
manager we're actually not too bad on
the CPU usage fluctuating between
anywhere from you know four to be 15% or
so actually not bad memory however it
looks like we're eating almost half of
our memory which is not that great but I
am pretty confident that once we get rid
of let's see all the processes here did
you do them son no look at that
oh yeah this is gonna be fun this is
going to be little good
so before we start clearing out programs
and all that let's let's first see what
we're working with here let's take this
for a spin I'm going to open up Firefox
see me even my aunt uncle
though that Internet Explorer sucks so
good on them for that it's loading its
loading its loading my Internet's not
very slow at all so any kind of slow to
NGC right now is probably the CPU or
memory or both doesn't look like this
page is loading at all so let's just go
to see google go to google first it's a
good kicking off point all right and
let's do YouTube bit wit so so far I
mean I mean at least the mouse isn't
chugging along the web pages are loading
pretty slowly though let's go ahead and
open up task manager and see what that
oh look at that 100% CPU usage holy moly
they're just going to stay there at 100
memory is where we're rocking a almost
800 on 800 megabytes right now and
actually the system really only has
about 800 750 to 800 megabytes of
available memory because of the page
file I believe we've now loaded my
YouTube channel there is a video that's
trying its hardest to play and it's just
not it's not very watchable at all this
is not good so what we're going to try
to do now is let's see if we can even
like this is sluggish this is what
happens when I try dragging the window
left and right like crazy just there's a
bit of lag there to say the least so
what we're going to do now is I'm going
to try to get rid of all these processes
all of these guys uninstall all the
unwanted programs make sure that there's
nothing on our startup that is is
unwanted and then we're going to try
browsing the web again to see if the
results are any different we'll also be
looking at the performance the second
time around to see if any of our system
resources have been freed up after we
get rid of all this crap
alright I'm also going to try to give
the system a good defragging which
sounds much dirtier when I say it out
loud but don't go anywhere I will be
right back with hopefully some good
results all right ladies and gentlemen
so I'm not fully done yet this is a
little bit of an intermission here but I
finished wiping out pretty much all the
crap programs
I guess there's still a few HP bloatware
apps that I can get rid of but for the
most part this is all we got here it's
not an extensive list of apps but I
probably deleted over 30 different
programs just now and pretty much cut
down a lot of the system resources if we
go over here to performance all
so disabling like at least a dozen
applications from startup helped a lot
so the CPU usage is still kind of all
over the place but for the most part
it's a it's looking pretty good right
now when we're just idling memory usage
is down to around 300 megabytes
I also decrease the size of the page
file just to give us a little bit more
wiggle room for our RAM there so now I'm
going to run ccleaner ccleaner is
something I just installed right now and
it kind of helps you clear out all of
those residual registry files that are
just eaten up space and can sometimes
bog the system down so I'm going to go
ahead and run it
okie dokie all right cleaning complete
we got rid of about 1.2 gigs of data all
right not bad we're going to go ahead
and run the next thing now which is PC
to crap a fire another great tool that I
like to use when cleaning out systems
especially old ones like this one
I should probably install it first
though all right so I have done what I
think is a good job of cleaning the
system out you can see here we are
idling right now zero CPU usage I'm
pretty proud of that getting it down to
zero memory is again at 300 megabytes or
so and then if you look at the processes
we've cut these down quite a bit there's
still probably some stuff on here that
we could eliminate but for the most part
this is this is what I could do for now
let's do a browser test browser tests
take to fire up some Firefox see it's
watch it low-budget load still takes a
while to load the home page there it is
clicking clicking clicking loading
loading loading alright it's still
pretty slow you know slow too slow to
load web pages that have lots of images
or icons you can see they just popped up
there and moment of truth let's see if
the video will play back any any more
smoothly than it was before looks like
fractal josh is a little stuck so is
Pikachu Kyle I feel like it's definitely
better than it was but it's not ideal
and overall I would say that this is not
a workable system so I think even
despite everything we did when you have
a system that's more than
ten years old it's probably not going to
be worth your time effort or money to
repair it and you're probably better off
just building a new one so maybe that'll
be a follow up to this video honestly I
was planning to clean this all out and
make it look all nice and pretty but
only if we got the system to work
reasonably which it is clearly not that
that's just the way the cookie crumbles
sometimes folks hopefully you guys
aren't too disappointed that this wasn't
a happier ending but again like I said
maybe we'll do a part to you I know my
uncle did express some interest in
potentially having me build them a new
system so that could be something that
we do soon let me know in the comments
if there's anyone in your own family who
still uses an ancient computer and is in
dire need of an upgrade I'd love to hear
all those stories otherwise toss me a
like on the video if you enjoyed it you
