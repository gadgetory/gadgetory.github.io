what's up Gaz if you're watching this
video on the day of upload the embargo
on Intel's seventh generation core
processors has finally lifted giving me
free rein to spill the beans on KB Lake
and it's Zee 270 chipset but in light of
preparing for CES in Las Vegas which is
practically here I'm keeping this launch
video short and sweet with a set of
benchmarks between the flagship KT like
core i7 7700 K and its direct successor
the skylake core i7 6700 K to see what
increase in gaming performance one might
benefit from when upgrading to the newer
platform now as a semi spoiler we're not
going to be seeing through the roof
gains here because kb lake is just an
optimization of the same 14 nanometer
architecture that skylake is based on
not to mention both carry the same core
core 8 thread count and cache capacity
although clock speeds see a nice boost
in the new core lineup much of the hype
surrounding kt lake involves support for
features like intel superfast obtain
storage technology and a wider range of
interfaces with z2 70 such as on-board
USB 3.1 gen2 type-c now are these cool
next level features that we should get
excited about yes
will they increase our frame rates and
make our games prettier not a chance
still I would be a fool to think that
would stop you guys from asking whether
or not you should upgrade from Skylink
to KB like specifically for gaming which
is why I've made this video to tell you
in a nutshell no to back this claim up I
used a number of constants for our
testing including 16 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance lpx ddr4 3200 the corsair h
100 i GTX b2 a gtx 1070 founders edition
running at reference speeds a 1 terabyte
crucial MX 200 and an old but still
working corsair HX 750
power supply the only variables in this
test were the CPUs of course and the
motherboards for z170 I employed the
ASUS Maximus 8 formula and its new
challenger the Z 270 gaming m7 from MSI
for the skylake 6700 K I was able to
overclock it to 4.6 gigahertz
while the 7700 K which turbos to 4.5 out
of the box was able to hit 4.9 gigahertz
after some quick tuning in the BIOS and
this is certainly one of the bigger
attractions of KT Lake awesome
overclocking potential and higher clock
speeds over its predecessor finally all
games were tested on the three seven
6.33 Nvidia drivers on Windows 10 on a
motherboard retail box on a crappy table
I got at Walmart true story with all
that said let's fire up the benchmarks
and see how these two chips stack up
jeez Louise
this is the biggest stalemate since that
one time I played chess and it was a
stalemate shut up I know I told you guys
not to expect any huge games but I'm not
sure there were any gains to begin with
I mean the 7700 k's widest lead was 3
FPS in GTA 5 at 1080p and the rest of
the results were so close there's really
no distinct winner it's basically a wash
while this seems kinda no really
disappointing at first the upside here
is that if you have a 6700 K that you're
mostly using for gaming you don't have
to feel like you're being left behind
with this new release these kinds of
tests are a constant reminder that most
games today are still heavily GPU bound
and based on this initial batch of
results skylake seems to be just as
capable at gaming as its refined
counterpart I would have loved to
compare thermals like I normally do but
at the time of filming KB Lake isn't yet
recognized by monitoring software so
that'll have to wait for a future video
that is all I've got for now guys sorry
if the info was a bit light for this
launch but I'm sure there's no shortage
of kb light content popping up as we
speak
till next time don't forget to toss me a
like on the video and I hope you guys
are having a great new year so far feel
free to subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and if all goes well I
will see y'all in the next video at CES
2017 have a go</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
