clear so oh no important updates are
pending do not restart now we're just
getting annihilator mommy later on that
one windows
all right guys live for definite welcome
welcome back to awesome hardware this is
episode 139 side B there's a live tech
news show that Paul and I do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
you're watching the second half of
today's show you can watch the first
half if you missed it on Paul's channel
I'll put a link for that in the
description below you can go to
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware for
that or if you're watching on twitch
just stay where you are it's good to
have all you back for first time viewers
watching this live welcome we tend to
have fun and let loose a little bit
we'll have an adult beverage or two or
three from time to time so Cheers if
you're drinking along with us
occasionally we may also use some adult
language some foul language so if you
have little ones around or if you have
sensitive hearing be aware of that shit
so we also sell stuff on our stores my
store is big with tech slash store and
you can go there right now and buy all
the cool shit that I have to offer
including shirts hoodies glasses mugs
dee cut deep dick dick
well that's decals whatever those words
and words and a lot more stuff
mouse pads the mouse pads are really
nice and they've been selling well which
means people are liking them I drew I
would really love to have a review
element on our sites right where people
could actually review on the quality of
the products and stuff my old site had
that your old site did have that yeah
but then John was like no because I'm
pretty confident that if we had reviews
on her stuff like the quality of all of
our shit we sell is really know I had
Ahad reviews because I use bigcommerce
before the first year that I was doing
merch I was using bigcommerce and I had
people reviewing my stuff that's like
this is awesome yeah thanks to any of
you guys who posted a review when my
site was on bigcommerce sorry they're
all gone now
yeah your work was no it wasn't I was I
was in the States for nothing I read the
reviews and and I found them they were
heart touching you know technically only
one of us really needs to have reviews
because we kind of sell the same shit we
all go through the same guy like if you
buy a shirt for me it's the exact same
quality and level of
of like delivery and stuff and service
as what you'd buy and Paul store but he
also the differences that we have
different logos and stuff on some of our
things and also items let's show my
store to contrast Paul has hoodie zipper
hoodies mouse pads as well desk mats I
just got one of these um yeah no I did
too I mean I had one forgot one of the I
got the updated one yeah they're really
nice
I just got one for the first time you
also have a bottle opener she's been
doing very well that very sexy logo key
cap custom key cap I like people anyway
thanks like guys who buy our stuff and
support us yeah we hope you like the
merch we try to make sure it's all it's
all good stuff and if you buy stuff
during the show we'll shout out your
name at the end of the show to say thank
you yes yeah loud and proud Johnson as
well um alright let's dive right into
some tech news picking up or Paul left
off we are gonna talk about one two
three three or four stories here before
we move on to the next segment so first
of which is risin risin ap use just
launched the new risin 320 200 G and
2400 J which is a verizon 5 um those are
all very well reviewed by myself Paul
and other reviewers across the globe and
now a couple new SKUs a couple new AP
use have been spotted this articles from
WCC F Tech by mr. Hasan and this was
actually a leak that they spotted from
video cards dot-com where a rising 520
400 GE and a risin 320 200 GE low-power
Raven Ridge apu were spotted now this is
pretty much usual I mean this is real
time by the same am4 platform here
however we're featuring lower 35 watt
TDP s so there's gonna be a little bit
more low-power than as you might expect
we're gonna see some lower clock speeds
as well anywhere from 3 to 400 megahertz
slower actually on the CPU and GPU so
these are like extremely low-power very
they're probably gonna be quite a bit
cheaper as well than the existing ap use
that just launched this week the 2400 ge
is gonna have four cores and eight
threads very similar to the 2400 G and
with a 3.2 gigahertz base clock which is
definitely a bit lower with Vega 11
graphics so you're still gonna get those
1111 GPU chorus
however the GPU clock is unknown at this
time and it pretty much translates the
same over to the 2200 GE 4 cores 4
threads just like its rise in three
counterpart that launched yesterday with
a 3.2 gigahertz base Vega 8 graphics
with 8 GPU cores again we do not know
the GPU clock for now but just another
way to tear these socketed like like a
they're still a m4 mm-hmm alright and I
would assume that you know I would say
the 22 2400 GE is gonna be somewhere
between the the pricing of the 99 and
169 for the existing GPUs because you're
getting 8 8 threads I think that's some
somewhat valuable so it looks like the
silicon is exactly the same they're just
they're shipping it with a different
with different lowering clock speeds to
lower it to lower the TDP yeah I mean I
feel like you wouldn't be able to sell
them for any different price cuz it's
like if you took an existing 2200 G and
under clocked it then you'd have a 2,200
GE right yeah I suppose so
ok but yeah I I guess it remains to be
seen
we're not exactly sure what Amy's gonna
do with pricing here but that is a good
theory so you can get by with you know
with with a much lower cooler maybe
maybe that's a difference you know the
Wraith stealth is what you get with the
current with the 2200 G and 2400 G maybe
there's an even lower end cooler than a
little ship with or something or the
reef and the Wraith basic the Wraith
basically that shit who knows yeah we'll
see that's a lot 3 to 400 megahertz
slower I mean these things are probably
gonna be I mean it's a it's a pretty
significant drop in TDP considering that
it's only 3 or 400 megahertz slower
you're going from 65 watts down to 35
watts so yeah but that's on the CPU and
GPU so I mean I guess that adds up
that's a whole almost a gigahertz it's
almost a gigahertz slower combined but
it'll be interesting
see those benchmarks assuming this is
all true and video cards WCF tech
haven't pulled one over our eyes but
moving on here let's talk about the
actual AP users that have already hit
the market this week and this article
from gamers Nexus shout out to Steve and
Friends what's up guys this is a great
article just kind of pointing out that
you know when these aps first launched
there are a lot of people reporting that
they were hitting ridiculous overclocks
4.6 gigahertz thereabouts which is
pretty insane but Steve writes in the
article that you know they're not so
they're not so sold on that idea that
these are legitimate over clocks that
people are seeing they think they're
speculating here that this might be a
result of a Windows bug a Windows tining
bug specifically I don't think he was
speculating oh well just saying he
demonstrates in the video oh I didn't
watch the video I just read the article
because it was I could read it in less
than 8 minutes ok but ok then the in the
article he speculates in the video he
confirms according to Paul so we do have
a Windows sleep state or an s3 state
that you can put your system in
basically going to sleep and upon waking
the system up you've essentially slowed
down there's a bug a known Windows bug
that that slows down windows time
reporting so basically what that means
is when you're running certain
benchmarks that don't have a timing or a
clock validation built in some some way
to validate the timing you it actually
gets confused and and runs the same
benchmark in what it thinks is less
amount of time which gives you a higher
benchmark score and also for monitoring
applications a higher readout for your
clock speed and your frequency so it's
pretty pretty simple explanation
this was also this has also been seen in
in previous previous platforms and other
CPUs this is a older a.m. every bug was
when Rison launched it was it was one of
the known bugs with it that they've
they've since patched but it apparently
is currently affecting these ApS with
with their current bios and driver
setups seems to be a common thing with a
certain AMD platforms as Steve mentioned
in the article older 3 a.m. 3 boards did
the same thing that you
kind of trick windows into running time
at half speed which would essentially
double the benchmark results and I
believe the frequency so something to be
aware of that you know if you're
expecting to get some ridiculous
overclocked on these things with like a
race spire around 4.6 gigahertz then the
Articles that you're probably reading
are not quite balanced so and the way it
happens is you you have the system up
and running this is what Steve dam
demoed in the video you have a system up
and running if you restart Windows 10 it
actually does what prior what what with
older operating systems you would you
would classify as like a full shutdown
and restart if you shut down Windows 10
it actually puts it into a more of a
standby state so doing that yeah
basically to induce the sleet's the
sleep state then when he would reset and
load up the load up the the test again
and he actually ran the test and did use
the timer at the same time and he showed
how on the computer a minute I'm sorry
on the computer a minute passes but the
timer a minute and seven passes so that
can the computer thinks that time is
going slower right and so you know it it
it completes the test faster and with
the test like Cinebench which some of
these reports on articles were we're
talking about Senate bench doesn't
double check to make sure that the time
that's elapsed is actually accurate
whereas other applications like 3dmark
do so pop pop up an error in that case
so Senate bench is like oh you were able
to output you know this much work in
this amount of time so you did a real
good job when in fact a minute and seven
had passed versus said a bench thinking
a minute at best right okay yeah
thanks Windows bug and thanks Steve for
the frozen all the research on that also
confirms that Steve can speed up and
slow down time he is a time shift
favorite it's the hair in video next up
is somehow now worth more than IBM hey
tech giant IBM that's that's quite a
feat its articles from tech central but
it's been sort of plastered all over the
web
so the the numbers came in for the
current quarter and NVIDIA sort of blew
way past their projections there were a
lot of industry analysts were
speculating around 2.4 billion a lonely
2.4 billion actually hit 2.9 billion
that's a lot that's a lot more billions
to be honest that's a whole half a
billion that's a lot of billions and so
there's some reasons to explain this
other than the fact that you know
they're just selling lots of GPUs to
gamers gamers are still making up about
60% of invidious revenue but now this is
being supplemented by the crypto miners
crypto mining craze is just freakin
insane and data data center operators as
well as AI systems that you know are
used to drive cars and things like that
NVIDIA has sort of tapped into a lot of
different markets besides gaming which
AMD hasn't done quite as much of when
you go to like you know CES for example
you get really good idea of just how
spread out they are Nvidia that is
because you know they're like they're in
the regular main show floor and they're
also in the other hall where it's just
all automotive like in videos everywhere
they've kind of got their their hands in
a bunch of different industries and
they're sort of following the latest
trends when it comes to computing and
that's sort of what the article talks
about it's like that's why they're sort
of way ahead of the competition here
I think Jensen you know the founder and
CEO I was saying something like that's
why we're you know always surprising the
the the market the industry and were you
know outputting 10 times the amount of a
business in terms of you know graphics
cards anyway as their competitor so
that's all very interesting and you know
they've shown revenue growth of more
than 20 percent for the last seven
quarters you know it's gone from
quarterly sales of less than 1 billion
in 2014 to approaching 3 billion
probably in the next year too so that's
very impressive
there's more numbers in the article that
that the talk about how their shares are
increasing and how they're just making
in general shit tons of money so it's
good good job Nvidia you know ads on the
back all around he's been doing well
they have they've been do very well for
themselves so apparently Sean wait just
won the gold medal did he now yep well
that surprises no one because he's the
only like apart from Chloe Kim the only
professional snowboarder whose name I
know he's the only household like I
don't know any other he didn't because
he he when the gold he's a video game in
bathroom he won the gold three Olympics
ago and and then more Olympics ago but
in Sochi he lost he didn't write he
didn't I don't think even he was on the
podium and but yeah he was like yeah
halfway I watched last night and last
night he was last night I caught someone
last night it was pretty cool he did a
run which was just like a really absurd
like he were like these are qualifiers
they're not gonna go BAE it go crazy
yeah and he did a run that was just
really good yeah and then two of the
other competitors from one craft were
they from ever get any way to other
competitors and I was one dude from
Japan and the other guy from I want to
say Australia mm-hmm beat his his
callsign score in the qualifying run so
he had but you get three runs and on the
last run he went and just like went nuts
he did this crazy run and scored even
higher than them so even though his
qualifier so yeah mmm wait sorry and for
any of you who aren't watching the
Olympics right now thanks for watching
her life show okay really
maybe your dual watching you know we got
two screens and my laptop screen just
[Laughter]
the RGB is still on the keyboard still I
know it's still lit BAM hey boy this is
definitely not
I think chat says chat said he did
back-to-back 1440s are they back-to-back
related just two of them it's insane
yeah first time ever I think four yep
okay I'm gonna screen watch I'm gonna
say he's gonna screen key Don Paul until
this is back we're on YouTube now we can
move on so um this actually I don't
really need to talk too much about this
I'll quickly go over because Paul sort
of mentioned it a bit in his in his
house jack this that's okay that's okay
no worries
let's see basically you know just to not
reiterate too much here YouTube has been
cracking down lately because of Logan
Paul and because he's a douchebag and
has been posting stupid videos offensive
harmful hurtful violent videos and no
one should do that and so of course you
go back to that saying of one bad apple
ruins the bunch and that's kind of
what's happening here I also have a
feeling that that's why twitch is sort
of stepping up their game as well on the
whole like hate speech and just hate in
general you know targeting other
platforms not just their own but if
you're a twitch streamer and you also
have a Twitter account YouTube page
YouTube channel I think it's it's valid
because oh definitely people shouldn't I
agree people shouldn't go ahead with
this feeling like oh I can do whatever
the heck I want over here because I have
this to fall back on like yeah exactly
if you're if you're making money as a
person who posts video or content of
yourself on the Internet's
yeah then you can't compartmentalize
where you post that stuff you're still a
person
and yeah so so I think it makes perfect
sense yeah absolutely and at the other
day you know YouTube twitch I think
they're really trying to protect their
their brand their image what society
thinks of them like when you just hear
the word like when you hear the word
like League of Legends I don't know how
it is nowadays but I remember back in
the day any time you'd mentioned League
Legends so start talking about that the
whole like you know consensus was like
oh they have it
terrible community like oh it's like so
toxic to get into because everyone's
just like super competitive and mean and
it's like that's what they're trying to
protect is like their their brand is
like their reputation if they were a
person so that also means you know it
sort of decides what kind of advertisers
are going to they're going to appeal to
right and so advertisers kind of like
their bread and butter you know at least
for YouTube and stuff so they're trying
to protect that and obviously douchebags
like Logan Paul are not advertiser
friendly because of the content they
produce and so YouTube doesn't make any
money or can't has a hard time making
money off of Logan Paul or even worse
has a headache because advertisers are
like dude you know coca-cola had
somebody like dude we put an ad on this
guy's freaking video he's showing like
dead bodies and tasing tased tasering
rats and shit like what the what the
actual fuck is this so it makes sense
I'm glad YouTube's cracking down it's
kind of a shame that you know you know
depending on how this goes I mean I've
never watched a Logan Paul video someone
in chat just asked if that's normal I
want to point out that I I never have I
have I have watched at least maybe 1 1
and a half of his videos just to see did
you watch the what the actual fuck I
didn't see like the the controversial
one of the dead body because it was
already taken down before I could even
try but I think beforehand I just come
across it was probably in the suggested
feed and so every once in a while I'll
be like alright what is the top 1% of
YouTube look like just from my own
understanding of where the mainstream
lies and I'm always like sort of
disgusted and disappointed with what I
watch I'm like holy crap if I'm ever if
I ever get in like the number 1 or
number 2 in the top 10 really top 20
spots on YouTube worldwide like slap me
in the face I've done something clearly
wrong I was going to pursue that the
world has made a change and that they're
now valuing content that is pure and you
know wholesome and valuable oh yes helps
people oh yes of course
with occasional swearing that's us we
could be that number one slot exactly
will take Logan's place no problem
remove
we're moving forward progress
so um you know it's interesting to see
it'll be interesting to see how YouTube
actually implements this if this is
going to be more of a hands-on type of
policing or if they're just gonna bake
it into their algorithm or maybe a
combination of both because the last
thing I'd like to see the last thing I'd
want to see is like them baked into
their algorithm and then have the
algorithm get even more fucked up and
have other creators who aren't really
posting offensive content get D
monetized or get you know taken away
from suggested feeds and things like
that because we already have people who
are getting to monetize like Brian from
VPS customs or Greg from Salazar a
science - do you know what I mean like
this is a serious issue already I'm
hoping it doesn't get worse because you
know YouTube wants to crack down or
whatever so I don't know it's it's good
but it kind of suck it's kind of scary
at the same time Oh they've been talking
a lot more about actual people doing
their views and that kind of thing so
yeah I hope yeah I mean I think that's
really what's necessary for a lot of it
yeah but you know they're they're gonna
try to coordinate things so that they
can they can monitor stuff and they can
censor stuff where necessary but that
they're still spending as little money
as possible and doing it right that's
what they go yeah exactly I can't hire
you know teams of thousands or whatever
someone said level one level in text is
also getting demonetized that's sad
they're like the most like informative
and an innocuous channel ever it's just
a shame but um we'll keep a close eye on
that and perhaps report on it as it
becomes more as more details come to
light but for now let's move on to pin
my PC pimp out some of y'all pcs we got
geum Franco I'm sorry if I'm butchering
your name I think you might have been
the donor on Pohl's half he was so thank
you but he was like hey can you do put
my PC so this is s following a karma and
looks like oh god worth it pick up burp
cigarette painful no good okay it says
keep it good work by PC is inspire in
various channels and both of you are a
part of it too didn't have
good natural light so I used a lamp it
looks really good lighting for a lamp I
mean are you related to Dimitri from
hard-working nuts this one has gone
through various changes is how I started
it looks like we do have some specs here
we got a 67 100k 7 an MSI GTX 1080
seahawk beautiful azrog Z 270 extreme
for motherboard 16 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance and bloody bloody blood is ein
to find C case with the 6700 K being
cooled by deep cool captain 240 yes
beautiful
ok cool so chess pieces his appreciate
the cable management shot in the back
there yeah the chess pieces are a nice
personalized touch yeah I think they're
classy and clear plastic you know clear
plastic can be not classy sometimes
clear heels for example not not a fancy
no chess pieces classy there you go
alright
you mentioned the USB strip being your
cheapo part the the cable for it is
standing out to me a little bit just
because everything else is so clean yeah
granted it's a white cable and
everything so it's not terrible but
that's just what is that for it's a USB
strip he has a USB LED strip I'm
guessing no maybe his motherboard
doesn't support support that or
something that looks like the receiver
that looks like the actual sensor is the
receiver for his control yeah so maybe
it's just a plug thing and so you could
tuck that away even more man you could
definitely all you really need is that
little that tip it's just the tip yeah
just just just the tip needs to be
peeking out you can you know shove away
the rest of it somewhere discreet and
clean it up I like the color scheme
again the cable management is very nice
your cable extensions look really clean
and they're they're variable management
very well managed and trained there's
the cover on the graphics card I'm I'm
trying to it's hard to see from this
angle wasn't made there's a backplate
cover yeah like it doesn't look like
it's completely flat
it doesn't look completely flat and I'm
not sure if it's an actual
like is it a piece that you cut out and
placed there or is it actually attached
to the card somehow I would recommend
because that looks like that card
already has a backplate on it it looks
like if you really wanted to go that
route I would consider removing the
backplate and spray painting it white I
think that would look a lot cleaner than
whatever this is that you have yeah
that's my opinion that are I could get
some get some of Hassan's back plates v1
v1 Tech yeah yeah v1 Tech everyone said
you didn't use those back plates you can
custom order them from him and stuff and
there's 3d printed but Jim Franco very
very nice built very clean yeah I like
it
thanks man next up we have Mauricio
boating steel he's got a course yes
let's see a as rock at 90 d de 3o an AMD
6350 Black Edition motherboard Wow and a
gtx 1050 TI superclocked from EVGA okay
Wow okay I see an IDE cable old-school
Wow
alright um only two pictures to I would
say most upgrading I remember this as
rock branding with the 5 5 5 X fast on
there I don't I don't recall what the 5
5 5 referred to again but just a
throwback remember that alright um Wow a
prio horizon it's my first thought
upgrade what upgrade to Rison yeah
because I was because like first I am
like oh god that's a terrible stock
cooler it's the worst one ever
it's so loud but there's not the most
terrible it has copper heat pipes I just
mean in terms of noise that one has
always the loudest to Mary led by a
landslide but there's really no point in
upgrading some like your CPU cooler
because your CPU itself is not worth
upgrading for I would just change the
platform it's a really dated platform
granted
6350 is that what a fork or is that like
an ink core
ah there's like 62 it's I always forget
at any rate you're probably better off
at this point going the Rison round
score okay you're probably better off at
this point going the rise and route to
something maybe like a risin 5
I think risin 5 would probably be my
sweet spot M 3 + 125 watt TDP damn on
that effect you can go for a 65 watt TDP
risin 5 chip like the r5 1600 for
example yeah which you can is a very low
barrier to entry to be honest it's a
really easy way to upgrade motherboard
didn't get a be 350 motherboard for a
lot cheaper than an X 370 and it's still
gonna be upgradeable later down the line
when second gen risin comes out if you
even wanted to go that route you're
gonna see a lot better performance I
think even with your 1050 Ti keeping
that card upgrading to Rison you're
probably gonna see some uplift yeah 1050
T is very very solid card there yeah um
I would keep that alright so if you
don't have any money to spend if you
can't do a full system upgrade it's hard
to tell you exactly what to do to fix up
stuff because you really have some cable
management issues here but you're using
a case that doesn't have that many
options for fixing it you'll have like
an IDE cable which appears to be for
like an optical drive that's got to be
really old and you've got like some
molex adapters going on and that kind of
thing you could potentially cinch some
of those down and tie them up and
everything and make that look a little
bit better but um honestly if your
system is working for you right now
don't bother and hold off until you
can't afford an upgrade and then
possibly look into making things look a
bit a little bit prettier there get a
new case that said functionally I bet
your system does a perfectly adequate
job for you and maybe rather than doing
anything we've mentioned just get an SSD
I've been an SSD would would give you
some actual practical like yeah speed
improvements system feel even faster
thanks Mauricio CPU nasty is next you be
next FX 9370 based system that's an 8
core 990 FX motherboard from MSI as well
as a Radeon r9 380 4 gig graphics card
16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance ddr3 memory
a Samsung 850 Evo 500 gig some Meg
car drives and a thousand watt 80 plus
gold EVGA power supply says he's been
waiting for a new graphics card which is
a good idea it's the first thing that
stands out to me is a graphics card
looks old
alright you've got two mechanical hard
drives down in the bottom there which
stand out to me slightly just because
they're mechanical drives I don't know
anything you can do to pretty those up
or do paint the top of them or something
like that replace them with SSDs that
might help you could replace some of
SSDs but the expense
maybe that's expensive alright your
you've got them slight mishmash of fans
I don't know what this fan on the top is
looks like it has clear blades it's
gonna budget more seer fan yeah of
course I led fan Carroll management
isn't bad I mean things are mostly
mostly tidy yeah just that area down at
the bottom I feel like cleanup those
cables a little bit maybe consider doing
something to make the graph of the
drives more aesthetically pleasing I
guess but you know and dust your system
yeah and and give it a gives a meaning
some cleaning could could help things
out a bit there beyond that I don't know
I'm like your air flows reasonably
balanced yeah okay
I mean honestly if I was gonna upgrade
any main components I'd probably like
like the last submission from mauricio
upgrade your overall platform to Rison
potentially I mean you know you've got
to be pulling a lot of heat with that
9370 holy crap it's got a liquid-cooled
done yeah that's a 120 and I know it's
far 3.0 it's probably decent enough but
I just feel like it's dated old
and everything looks old I mean I would
upgrade here's the thing I would upgrade
the CPU and motherboard and the memory
before I upgraded the GPU because now is
a terrible time to upgrade for GPU so
yeah if that's if you were looking for
some core upgrade advice I would go with
the CPU first and then you know you you
can you can hang with the other than r9
380 or whatever it is it's a 380 yeah
three that's that's not payable you can
still do some tending to gaming with
that so but that would be my advice and
yeah good hard drives don't look all
that great get some SSDs thanks nasty
all right next time is Brandon derp Bert
but I'm the only 1080 g1 gaming from
gigabyte a 4790k CPU 16 gigs of Ripjaws
ex 2133 memory ddr3 z97 gaming 7
motherboard from MSI supernova 1000 watt
power supply one terabyte crucial MX 300
SSD 3 terabyte Seagate hard drive
courser h 100 i and the air 240 case
from Corsair so another another 240
another 240 again with the hard drive on
the bottom doesn't look all that great
yeah I also also dust on the bottom lots
of dust cleaning and interesting get a
sound card in there here we have the
always sort of controversial discussion
around the not - of fans in that they're
very good fans and they probably do a
really good job on that you know but the
aioli but they definitely are the most
classy things when it comes to your
color scheme spray-paint yeah I mean we
consider that or just considering
swapping them out for the Noctua
industrial fans they have some all-black
ones or some gray and black ones that
are just as effective as the NFF twelves
but are much better looking also take
that sticker off your Ethernet yeah I
was gonna say the same thing right here
a little sticker on your on your iOS
that can easily be removed it's it's
it's reflective
and there's multi-coloured and very
distracting your red cable coming up
here for your graphics card it's one of
those egregious errors that EVGA made
early on with their power supplies which
is like hey let's make all these cables
all red if their current colors stupid
reason yeah whatever
stands out doesn't look that great an
extension would look better there yeah
yeah might as well get one for your
motherboard at the same time yeah so you
could potentially as swap both of those
out what do you think of the the sound
card at both the graphics card I'd be
very curious to to get some temporary
doubts on the GPU because I wouldn't
expect it to affect temperatures that
too much only a degree from the backside
and everything let's go connecting you
could probably drop it down to one of
the lower slots and give it some space
and give it a little bit more air and
and not have it right between your
graphics card and your CPU and it would
also make the GPU stand out a bit more
my balance things out a little bit give
it some room to shine yeah and I agree
wouldn't affect your performance at all
so that's a possibility there yeah
there's a few things you could do here
but overall really nice the consistent
yeah definitely
and again just one of those ones could
probably use a nice dusting yeah
alright thanks Brandon and then that's
from the bean bean 7700 Kay
and we have an EVGA gtx 980ti for the
win 3 yes I know it's on the floor donto
dot hall are giving you you know what
for being on the floor it's actually the
least dusty system we've seen in the
last few minutes that's true
so couse you keep it clean yes being on
the floor is ok with me if you're
willing to clean it off in your computer
every month or two yeah sure
look look so unless you just cleaned it
for for this mission who knows but looks
it looks like a very like it like a gets
gets shit done kind of computer like
definitely he's got lots of drives in
here three SSDs that I can see he's got
serious airflow going through here with
all those Maglev fans holy crap
that's great quite a few of those you
know cable management seems pretty on
point I think they could you know your
GPU and your motherboard could benefit
from sleeved extensions obviously as any
any system could so obviously you don't
care about staring at your computer
because you've got it down on the floor
down with the animals and other crap
down there with things you don't care
about but if you really didn't care
about your computer and wanted it to
look nice and wanted to look at it then
I would say getting some maybe some
decals or some likes of covers for your
SSDs there you know you can buy stickers
or whatever to put over the top of those
yeah that would make those look better
because they're they're kind of
mish-mashed
yeah and they don't match very well if
you did that and put and got like a
sleeved a cable kit for the power supply
because you can give full replacements
for that EVGA unit oh yeah that would
really make it look like wow this is a
this is a kitted out system done it's
all blingy
but other than that everything's
everything is really clean and get your
computer off the floor or Paul will come
in to fill you in your sleep
just goddamn respect holy crap and that
concludes p my pc thank you guys for
submitting you'll have another chance to
submit next week assuming we do the show
next week or the segment we do put my PC
all the time ok I was meant to say a
segment not the show worried we will be
doing the show next week don't worry
we'll probably do pin my PC as well
follow me on Twitter just so you don't
so you don't miss those updates but
moving on here this is a another segment
I guess it's a semi new segment I feel
like we've already done a second just
like this but I forgot the name of it
I'm calling it bad company even though
it says lower thirds news good news the
only the only functional one I have
right now that's ok this is a segment of
that in Pitt my PC this is a segment as
the name suggests about companies who
are not acting in
they're not on their best behavior there
there's a bit of controversy with with
companies were about to talk about
starting with Google Google not honoring
the warranty for their pixel phones
mm-hmm from ours Ars Technica those
suckers with a pixel phones will get
what they deserve we both have pixels
Paul yeah shit yeah I do have this is
for the pixel not - pixel - this is a
quarter yeah apparently the pixel there
was no mention of a pixel - in the
entire article this is a pixel XL
affected yes yes so San Francisco law
firm filed a is filing a class-action
lawsuit against Google for allegedly
manufacturing defects in the microphone
on pixel and pixel XL handsets
oh I never use a microphone I love your
phone yeah you never would use a
microphone look you never make phone
calls you ever use a phone for phone
purposes that's ridiculous most ways am
I actually surprised speech that detects
speech the most common for sure but this
is a the firm's clients are Patricia
weeks and why leaned on bar of
California they both bought pixels in
2016 so this is definitely pixel one
that we're talking about months
afterwards just a few months they said
they both said that they were
experiencing defective microphones they
were denied a refund or replacement by
Google customer service and this was
within their 1-year warranty for the
Google pixel phones the compliance
states dr. weeks did not know that the
pixel phones have defective microphones
when she bought her phone had Google
disclosed the defect to her up front she
would not have bought a pixel or would
have paid substantially less for it sure
makes sense so just the whole the whole
issue here is that there was a defect
within six months of buying it the
warranties one year but still Google
would not issue her a refund or a
replacement and so here we have a
class-action lawsuit the lawsuit is also
claiming that you know just to iterate
here Google's and breach of its own
warranty which says the company well in
its sole discretion and
the extent permitted by law either
repair your phone using newer
refurbished parts replace your phone
with a newer refurbished phone
functionally at least equivalent to
yours or accept the return of the phone
in exchange for a refund of the purchase
price you paid for the phone what do you
think Paul do you think do you think
there's any gray area here do you think
it's pretty clear that you know I think
if they were able to demonstrate that
the that the microphone is defective and
they're within warranty then Google
should have replaced their phones I'm
confused why Google wouldn't yeah like
is Google saying no it's not defective
right like what MBI be curious what
their actual response was like I'm also
kind of wondering how in what way the
microphones defective it it's just not
like not picking up everything that's
being input into it because I haven't
any issues and I never had any issue
with my with my first pixels I saw
something on this earlier today and I
saw comments somewhere or something and
the comment was referring to somebody
who does a regular podcast or who like
dials into a regular podcast with a
group that all talk and whatever and
there's one dude who always does it on
his pixel phone pixel phone and he
always sounds like crap like that was
the that's pretty anecdotal I read that
earlier today I don't even remember
where and I wonder if that counts as a
defective as a defective versus like is
it just a crappy mic right like is
exactly it's just not that good of a
microphone maybe that's worse one of
those things that you know wasn't
pointed out interviews that much that
was that was my one complaint with this
article is I didn't really specify what
kind of issues the microphone was having
yeah it just was it could have been
maybe like a speech thing like or maybe
they were asking you know Google
assistant certain commands I didn't
understand they were writing that off as
a defect we don't really know what kind
of defect they're actually talking about
here so I guess that's that's kind of
important right to see you know who's
sort of in the wrong but you guys sound
off in the chat let us know what you
think if you have any speculation any
theories but we're gonna move on here
our next articles from the Burge
and this is about the home pod the Apple
home pod yeah and the art of the title
of the article is the home pod is the
point of no return for Apple fans sort
of meaning that you know typical apple
liking to preferring to lock you into
their ecosystem we're gonna be talking
about that here speaker is openly
hostile to any hardware and service not
made by Apple which sounds pretty
typical but this is actually kind of
insane just how how locked in you are
once you get the home pod for starters
if you're if you're not familiar with
this piece of tech the home pod imagine
it's sort of as Apple's response to the
Amazon echo or the Google home it's sort
of a speaker slash home assistant voice
voice controlled and stuff like that it
was launched this week for three hundred
and fifty dollars I think we got our
Google home 450 watch you know six seven
times cheaper but typical Apple once
again and according to the article and
several others it's only playing really
nicely and fully you can only only
really only take advantage fully of it
with other Apple products further
locking its users into the Apple
ecosystem and I'll just list off a
couple of examples of how just sort of
how strict it is with you know and how I
don't know just just how I'm trakone
Ian's draconian draconian is the word
that we're doing exactly the word I was
thinking of voice control for example
for for music playback only works fully
with Apple music iTunes or iTunes Match
now you can access services like Pandora
or Spotify through Apple AirPlay but
it's like severely limited to just play
in pause commands like like it's you
can't say like play Michael Jackson on
Spotify and it won't pick that up you
can you have to like play Michael
Jackson from your phone first and then
you can just say stop start or stop
pause play that's very limited there
unless of course you have an apple music
subscription additionally you must be
subscribed to to Laura actually you need
an iOS device to even set it up for
initial setup you need an iPhone in the
house
you don't know if you have Android it's
kind of pointless here doesn't even have
basic bluetooth streaming you can't just
like Bluetooth a YouTube you can't you
know you can't hmm you can't like show
like a group of friends you know a
YouTube video just have a place that the
speakers or anything does not work like
that I'm still planning to buy one I'm
gonna buy three haven't deterred me one
for every room in my house people will
and so the article goes on to say that
also the fact that it's just three
hundred and fifty dollars if you're
buying something like this and it relies
so heavily on other Apple products to
work fully then what are the chances
that you're gonna switch from an iPhone
to a Samsung or a Google phone in the
future if you already have you know two
one two or three of these things in your
home I mean you know three hundred fifty
bucks a pop if you're treated like a
Sonos type of thing because you can
obviously link all these up you're
spending like potentially a grand on
these in-home speakers that granite
granite sound really good but at that
point if you can only really use it with
iPhone what happens if the next
generation iPhone remove something else
that you love besides the the headphone
jack what if next it's like a screen
there's no screen now you don't get any
display on the next iPhone
well sorry dude you just paid a thousand
dollars in in in-home pod fees and
you're probably gonna feel obligated to
go with iPhone again because you don't
want to miss out on that functionality
that you've already made an upfront
investment in so just have to trust that
Apple knows what's best for you yeah
that's of course what's that's the no no
don't listen to Paul anyone also Apple
and Google you know Google like they're
playing the same game they're all trying
to get into the interwoven crevices of
our personal lives in every way possible
with phones laptops TVs smart home
integration in our cars I mean Google
and Apple are competing for every aspect
of our lives the difference the
difference being is that Google tends to
play a little bit more nicely with
others
you know I can I can play Spotify or I
can play Pandora seamlessly from my
google home with an Android or an iOS
device no problem
Google's Google plays nicely with others
whereas Apple just seems to lock you in
with they closed their doors basically
to keep you in to their own ecosystem so
to keep you safe Kyle it's to keep me
safe yes yes protection security there's
always a trade-off between security and
and freedom definitely so you know
apples Apple and at the end of the day
though like they still have hundreds of
millions of people who are gonna buy the
shit oh yeah they don't they don't need
like that's okay they can get all the
negative press on the home pod for 350
bucks could be a total ripoff and
useless and you know proven over and
over and over that Google Homes a better
option makes more sense they're still
gonna make a killing because they just
have their leveraging just a massive
global audience and an user base that
you know is gonna eat this shit up no
matter what you do or tell them so what
can you do I'm just glad that not every
company approaches business in this way
I'd be terrible I like having sort of
mutt or like a Frankenstein of different
devices from different companies that
all sort of integrating work nicely
together because not there's no one
company in the world that does
everything great you're always the best
at everything you kind of need to pull
from a little bit of here a little bit
of that anyway you guys let me know what
you think in the comments in the chat
that is in our last our last article in
this segment bad company comes from
reddit actually it's a reddit post
pointing out that the Chinese VGA
manufacturer colorful guys know the mast
has kind of done some plagiarism on
their about page they've actually copy
pasted the about page from EVGA the
other VGA company and just straight up
copy pasted it into their own about page
they they they just replaced they just
replaced their company name
they didn't even bother changing the
headquarter location colorful still says
on their about page that they're based
in Brea California doesn't oh do they
remove it to say updating they removed
it yes before it literally said we are
based our headquarters in Brea
California is a beautiful you know
facility
whatever the EVGA one says it was
literally copy pasted verbatim I like
the top the top comments yeah random
intern could have taken twenty minutes
to write a paragraph on the about page
yeah so just copy pasting it but come on
come on got a screen cap there's got to
be here we go oh no I should have screen
captain damnit of I was pretty shocked
that they hadn't pulled it already by
the time I saw the article so I figured
there it is it's a little cut off but
you kind of get the gist of it to give
credit to ready to use it Corey one two
three one two five go ahead yeah you can
see there it says Brea California on the
left on the bottom throughout North
America yeah like it's like they could
have at least copy pasted it from
another Chinese VGA manufacturer to make
it a little bit closer to what they're
actually about but I felt like a very
fitting very fitting article for Bad
Company
come on colorful that's hire a writer
hire an American writer
good lord there are plenty of them
plenty of them looking for work right
now geez gee whiz I agree alright
alright and that's gonna conclude for my
half for the most part we can go ahead
and tap into some donation comments here
yes all right Thank You self for
deleting the other the other donations
very thoughtful makes it very easy to
just sift through these here so first
off we've got bazinga for the tenth of a
zynga X ten dollar donation kyle
confession good for the soul
snowboarding or wife putting you in line
yes what am I missing did did you
actually introduce yourself snowboarding
or oh did Heather strike you or
otherwise ah ha ha use you and that's
why you're actually sore mmm I'm gonna
I'm gonna blink twice cuz you know you
know you know what that means
keep it she's watching she's moderating
chattering extra I can't really I'm
blinking twice yeah all right thank you
very much bazinga next we've got pup
Sheva out of ten dollars lost identity
just has gun violence no sex stuff well
then I'm not interested
very i was hoping for the sex now I'm
just getting that that's good
I mean gun violence is great I love love
lots of gun violence but that's good you
know least you're shooting the pistols
not doing anything you're not supposed
to with the pistols whatever rifles that
you might be wielding I don't know what
I'm doing with this thanks bub thanks
pop I mean I'm gonna look for your I'm
gonna look for your your gun violent
film lost identity check it out you
should speaking of which aren't you
looking for something to do tomorrow
with wifey sauce on Valentine's Day yes
next donation from Heather Hansen $5.00
aka Kyle's wife yep where are you taking
me for Valentine's Day also I want
flowers it I think you guys should
settle in for a viewing of lost identity
it's film it's very it's very rude your
closet romantic Paul hmm I don't think
people really notice but yeah it's
definitely people ask me for dating
advice all the time yep I'm sure they do
until the first time I've actually
respond until they take your advice
yeah can't believe he's just a lost
identity man it's it I'm getting a
divorce
that's I mean it's it's kind of an art
film but I mean you have to just really
inspired
look watch it pop just like did you get
it
like did you get it just just dudes blow
each other there's no sex though I know
I was a hypothetical thank you pop I'm
looking forward to seeing and and honey
well we won't see lost identity together
for Valentine's Day but we'll plan
something else and maybe I'll just watch
the loss identity by myself and crying a
corner somewhere anyway getting
off-topic bazinga
x4 the five dollar donation Kyle virus
strikes again wall I am a cancer upon
this world thank you for reminding me
bazinga Aaron Rodgers $10 I realize
y'all share but whatever head also 21 by
9 monitor recommendations preferred
resolution and thanks for the burp so I
mean I feel like 40 by 1440 would be the
resolution yeah if you can if you can
claw your way up to that they tend to be
more expensive but 34 40 by 1440 is just
more real estate it's better as you get
a lot more real estate you get a lot
better like pixel density compared to
the what's the 1080 version so this is
20 20 25 16 2560 by 1080 yeah you get a
lot more out of that so yeah trying to
get that if you don't need G sinks then
you can find some some reasonable price
34 35 inch monitors but yeah that's
that's what I'd say go for yep thank you
very much John engine from the five
bucks no comment thank you John thank
you
Steve Bittner five dollars no comment
either thank you Steve
thank you you guys are quiet speak
center- five dollars Paul I got an old
Wow donating $5 to me but you have to
answer the question uncle with that hey
that's what happened Paul I got an old
27-inch Asus Pro art would like to
upgrade to a g-sync 100 megahertz plus
quad HD wide q HD 4k 10 bit display I
can calibrate got a recommendation
g-sync
hundred megahertz plus
quad HD 4k ten bits I don't know you
usually don't find 10 bit with high
refresh rate g-sync
because 10 megahertz + yeah because
megahertz I just I just
these aren't these aren't numbers I keep
in my head as far as monitor skews cuz
there's usually usually there's Asus and
LG and maybe Acer and maybe BenQ and
maybe Samsung and maybe a couple others
so really it's a matter of taking those
specs that you're looking for gisun
cutter megahertz figuring out the the
size that you want and then just looking
at what's available with that because I
have a feeling
plugging in g-sync cutter megahertz +
2560 by 1440 or 4k ten bit that's gonna
narrow it down a lot and do that power
search yeah so and then and then within
that you're gonna want to look for them
for reviews on the specific monitors and
that kind of thing that said since you
already have an ace who's perc Pro art I
do like that series and especially if
you're doing and professional work
they're very good color reproduction and
typically they're they can be further
calibrated beyond the factory
calibration they have as well so
consider another use / / art I guess I
wish I could give you more specifics but
I can't without doing internet searching
yep same John hedge it's $5 donation
said you guys are awesome thank you John
I've been watching you since the new egg
days I sent you guys a gift on your
Twitter's oh thank you John that's gonna
take a look at that I'm scared
speaking of which I haven't even I'm
scared oh yes you open that shit and
they'll keep for a reason ease up thank
you very much John I'll check for your
gift on Twitter soon very soon next
we've got Shane WF for the 10 Australian
I believe sending some love from
Australia I was correct Thank You Shane
that is very generous of you
gear seekers for the 5 Australian as
well when we come out to the US for
VidCon can we jump on your livestream
hmm usually we prefer people to leap on
our livestream no
if you can find us if you can find us
then I'll be thoroughly impressed and by
all means you can do whatever you want
on a live stream just don't get his band
m30 Tech from ten bucks got real drunk
one night at CES woke up after the msi
party with the with pictures of me with
kyle on my cell don't remember it looked
like it was a good time hope I didn't
embarrass myself I'm 30 Tec I don't
remember now probably Elsa doesn't
remember that I yeah exactly
so sometimes tweet me those pictures or
don't maybe we maybe those should never
be shared on publicly online okay hope
you had a good night
I this is a letter that was sent to me
I'm working in some mail time here I
just have a couple things that were sent
this was sent by Jacob and it's airmail
and I'm not sure where it came from but
I feel like it maybe it was from outside
of the country possibly I'm not sure but
Jacob he says he's a loyal fan and wrote
a very very nice letter to me just sort
of related some of the stuff that was
dealing with back in January so uh Thank
You Jacob thank you this is really
really nice letter he also finished with
how do you deal with Kyle's burps and I
have to hold I hold my breath and I hope
I don't pass out I think that's usually
do do that goes well I thank you thank
you so much diagnostics for Sunday then
ends yeah yep Leonard Shan plays from 20
bucks love the content keep them coming
thank you very much Sean I appreciate we
both appreciate it we will we will keep
that content coming coming right at you
yeah ran your face bazinga X 10 bucks
which GPU is 4 for 4 HD monitor maybe he
means for 4k monitors I assume I will
need two GPUs if you're trying to game
on for 4k monitors you will definitely
need two of the fastest at four HD means
I don't know I would imagine what else
could 4 HD media listening SMO HD most
modern GPUs like NVIDIA after the 900
series at least supports
outputting to 4 displays at the same
time with the single
pee-yew if you want a game across all of
them then yeah
you will need I believe the nvidia
standard right now is you can do three
displays for gaming if you want to do
triple display and a companion of a
fourth connected that can still have
stuff displayed on it but it can only do
to me right now so yeah if you're
talking about just a couple HD monitors
then either way if you're doing three
monitors at any resolution 1080 or over
heaven two GPUs is definitely helpful is
it really I think so that's a lot of
that thing if that's what it is
unless there's just a lot of packaging
it's okay so one other box sent to me
for mail time today by the way if you
want to send me stuff it's P o box for
three to five Diamond Bar California
nine one seven six five and that is
listed in the description for all my
videos I believe tiles feel box is also
listed in his description it is I don't
have anything from mail for mail time
today because I'm gonna get a chance to
stop by my peel box but it is also in
the description QR semi stuff so this is
sent by Zacharias homemade candles and
it's from Texas Texas homie and I think
they're just candles in here the other
candles well cool are they in the Genoa
penises or something I don't know but
that's I would expect nothing less from
our viewers now here we go
this is Jays two days two cents trimmers
other candle trimmers why does link join
me in one for tile and he sent one to
Jake okay I think I think this is coming
back to me now and this person asked me
if they could send me stuff for me Kyle
and Jay these are I think these are wick
trimmers for me pile on Jay Wow

the deodorant to him that's kind of
creepy
so the candles is very important when
you first burn them you have to burn the
view so when you first dice it you have
to make sure you let it burn for like
three hours
really yeah cuz that'll establish the
burn pattern around the outside and you
want to make sure the entire top of it
gets all liquid and when you light it in
the future it will burn evenly gotcha
and make sure you trim the wick every
time because you don't want a really
long wick if she looks really long the
candle the the flame will be really big
and it'll burn through the it'll make
more smoke and it'll burn through the
wax left that make sense so far I like
yours more than
okay yeah good urine interesting these
which are apparently candle tarts this
is inspired by cranapple Spice Paul's
hardware candle tarts
