first saw this cooler at Computex this
year I thought ASOS is big debut into
the liquid
ayoh market sounds promising why not and
then I got the sample a couple days ago
took a first glance and went yeah this
is actually looking pretty good then I
saw the price tag and went woah woah
pump the brakes compadre that's a lot of
spend Oh for your CPU friendo because
it's two hundred and eighty US dollars
this thing needs to absolutely crush the
competition in every sense of the word
and after putting it through its paces I
can confidently say it does not no it
doesn't the thermal take a 500 aluminum
TG mid-tower features a sleek aluminum
front panel and two four millimeter
tempered glass panels for breathtaking
views enjoy 420 and 360 rad support at
the front and top respectively and
breeze through installation with the
dismantle of all modular design step up
your case game with the a500 aluminum TG
and click on the link below for more
info so this is the asus rog region 360
millimetre liquid AI oh and for all
intents and purposes it is an ASA tech
cooler it's an ASA tech pump tubes
radiator ASA tech layered on top of that
we have three premium noctua IPPC
industrial grade 2000rpm pwm fans and
some cool design choices and features
that have been integrated into the
waterblock by asus now starting with the
radiator and fans I probably like this
part of the AIO the most from a hardware
perspective the fans are not to us
they're super high quality and we'll
talk about performance in just a bit but
they're all blacked out they've got
rubber corners on them to reduce the
noise and vibration and the sleeves for
the most part are sleeved in black with
again those four pin pwm connectors the
radiator is on the thin side at 27
millimeters thick but that's usually
what you get with these three hundred
and sixty millimeter a i/os and you've
also got a fairly dense looking fins
fact you get thirty eight millimeters of
sleeve tubing which doesn't kink very
easily that's a plus the gauge is on the
thinner side so kind of what you would
find with an NZXT crack and cooler for
example really doesn't affect
performance at all it's just a cosmetic
thing now this being a fairly basic ASA
tech cooler at its core you do have
fixed hoses to the water block and
radiator so you do not have an
expandable loop here you can't add a GPU
water block down the line you can't add
more radiators you can't even refill or
top off your fluids should it get low in
the future
and for the price I would have liked to
see that as a feature you do get a
sizable lot of cables coming off your
water block including SATA power USB 2.0
to connect this to your motherboard so
you can enable RGB lighting control and
some other things we'll talk about in a
moment there's a trio of 4 pin PWM
connectors for your fans and one 4 pin
PWM connector for your pump installation
of the waterblock is super quick and
easy its standard asa tech stuff i'm
sure a lot of you guys are already
familiar with how that works it did come
pre-installed with an Intel bracket so I
guess that saves you some time if you're
going Intel and will cost you some time
if you're going AMD on the front of the
waterblock we have sort of a two-tone
design here with some brushed aluminum
and this highly reflective kind of
plasticky glossy finish and I'm not a
huge fan of this it looks great when you
first take it out of the box but you
quickly realize that it micro scratches
very easily even taking a microfiber
cloth to it was just scratching it up
left and right so I don't know again for
the price I was expecting slightly
higher materials especially on the face
of the water block that's going to be
seen the most but the unit powered on
you can see the customisable addressable
RGB strip and the 1.7 seven-inch
full-color OLED display which can be
used for a variety of things like
displaying your own custom pictures or
graphics or even your systems
diagnostics like CPU temperature voltage
clock speed and so forth you can pretty
much select from a variety of data and
it'll cycle through them unfortunately
you can't choose the speed at which it
cycles so that's kind of a bummer
additionally you can put a custom
message on the OLED but it doesn't let
you change the font type or the size so
if you just wanted to write like one or
two words and fill up the screen you
can't it's just a tiny little piece of
text and you can hardly see it now I was
able to add my own still image and that
was pretty cool definitely adds a unique
element but for whatever reason an
animated gif just wasn't working it
wouldn't take the the ROG logo would
just stay there and stare at me
awkwardly I made sure it was the right
size resolution and all that and it
still would not take so that kind of
sucked the RGB is fine it looks great
you can turn it off if you want a bunch
of different effects whoop-dee-doo so I
don't know man I knew the OLED thing was
super gimmicky going into this but I
thought it would be cooler than it
really was you know I mean I couldn't
customize text I couldn't upload an
animated gif so the whole thing just
kind of left me disappointed over what I
thought was going to be one of the
cooler features of this product but what
can you do now this whole section is
actually removable shroud so I can pop
it off
just held in place by two magnets stays
on just fine it's fairly lightweight
because it's mostly made of plastic and
there's a naked view of the OLED screen
there but within this plastic housing at
the bottom there's actually a sixty
millimeter fan that fires air downward
out of these three openings and that's
supposed to cool down your vrm and your
MDOT to drive assuming that you have an
MDOT to slot and your CPU socket on the
bright side the fan is super quiet and I
could hardly even tell that it was on I
had to really put my ear super close to
it and even then I really just had to
look at the blades to ensure that it was
actually spinning so that's good it's
quiet the downside is is that it didn't
really seem to help our vrm temperatures
very much now granted I didn't go like
full gamers Nexus with testing and stuff
but I didn't really see a huge
difference in vrm temperatures coming
from this cooler to a fractal design as
36 which is also a 360 millimetre liquid
AO with a similar radiator to this one I
think it's 30 millimeters just three
millimeters thicker than this but yeah
it didn't seem to make a huge difference
maybe a degree or two here and there on
some of the temp sensors but wait it
gets even more underwhelming folks
because when it came to cooling our 99
hundred K this two hundred and eighty
dollar ryojun cooler performed equally
to our one hundred and fifteen dollar
fractal design s 36 both of them hit 74
C under load after 15 minutes in GTA 5
at 1440p both of them were averaging
anywhere from 55 to 65 degrees Celsius
during my gameplay that 74 C was just a
peak exactly the same it is also an ASA
tech cooler the fans are not knocked -
as they're the fractals own in-house
fans but they were just fine just as
effective and virtually just as quiet
here's a sound test
this cooler is twice as expensive as the
other one why why is it twice as
expensive I don't understand it doesn't
make any sense what are you paying for
are you paying for the lousy oled screen
or the the 60 millimeter fan that
doesn't seem to be doing anything no no
you're not you know you're paying for
this this right here
ROG and this this is well republic of
gamers and noctua these are premium
brands that sell for premium prices and
even though not everyone will pay these
extreme prices for such things there's
enough people who do and that's enough
for Asus to make a product featuring
these brands and selling it for an
extremely high price the only way you
could sell an arrow for $280 is you
can't you you just you just can't this
is definitely a rocky start for Asus
into the liquid aerial market if it
weren't for the price to be fine but
coming out with these numbers man I am
rooting for you I hope the next
iteration of these products is
affordable and that you've worked out
some of the kinks that we talked about
today haha
hos pun nailed it all right guys that's
gonna do it for me toss a look on this
video if you enjoyed it and get
subscribed for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon have a good one I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
