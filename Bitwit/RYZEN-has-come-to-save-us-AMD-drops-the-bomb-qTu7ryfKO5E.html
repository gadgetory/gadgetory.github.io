channel today I am reporting to you from
San Francisco California at the AMD
press event where they have just
unveiled a bunch of juicy details about
their long awaited family of Rison CPUs
based on the send architecture and you
guys have been waiting for this
information for a long time and I think
you guys are going to be fairly
impressed with the information I'm about
to share with you I do have a lot of
stuff to do right after this and I'm
pretty pressed for time so I'm gonna
make this quick and to the point
hopefully you guys don't mind so just
diving right in here disrupt was a big
word in this press event that AMD kept
throwing around because they are really
trying to disrupt the market with the
news and family of CPUs and I believe
they are going to based on the prices
and the specs that they have outlined in
today's press event all of the rise in
seven chips all three of them that are
confirmed right now we're going to
feature a course on 16 threads so SMT of
course and by the way all of the
processors in the Verizon family are
going to have unlocked multipliers which
kind of keeps the trend that we've seen
in the past from AMD now the first few
that they talked about was the r7 1700
and that's kind of the the base model
within r7 that's got a boost clock I'm
sorry a base clock of three gigahertz
boosts 23.7 that's a 65 watt TDP and
we're gonna see a according to the
benchmarks 46 percent over the 7700 K
instead of bench multi-threaded that
explains that's explained by the fact
that we've got that yeah or more cores
and eight more threads than the core i7
KB link processor additionally they
showed us a handbrake demo between the
1700 and the 7700 K and break again
being a multi-threaded encoding
application and we basically saw the
1700 render the it was a fairly small
file but it did render than 14% less
time than the 7700 K and of course
that's gonna save you tons more time if
you're dealing with larger files the
last time well they showed us what the
r7 1700 was a game and live stream setup
where you they basically had a MOBA
playing and they were streaming that out
I don't know if it was at 720p or 1080i
I'm not exactly sure but the encoding
settings were but they had that stacked
against the 7700 K once again on the
Intel side and basically it would like
night and day the Intel demo was choppy
it was there
clearly an amount of latency that was
virtually unplayable where I was on the
ricin side it was buttery smooth all the
way through and they ended up
calculating that the 7700 K system only
delivered 82 percent of the total frames
for that stream as opposed to 100
percent with the risin set up so that's
pretty impressive as well the next cue
on the line up is the r7 1700 X and this
has a base clock of 3.4 turbo's 23.8
with a 95 watt TDP so a little bit
higher now and probably a little bit
more commanding in the thermal
Department
I completely forgot to tell you the
price of the r7 1700 let me rewind the
price of the r7 1700 is three hundred
and twenty nine dollars us which
undercuts the 7700 K by about $20 MSRP
depending on where you're shopping but
that's very impressive considering the
benchmarks that we've seen so far now
back to the 70 1700 X they tested this
against the thousand dollar sixty nine
hundred K which was 99 percent slower
incentive inch multi-threaded the 1700 X
was 37% faster I'm sorry 39 percent
faster than the 6800 K which is a $500
CPU incentive inch multi-threaded as
well and this processor will come in at
just $400 which again undercuts the
Intel equivalent the 1600 K and finally
the processor that many of you have been
raving and ranting about for a long time
now is the 1800 X which is of course
AMD's flagship Rison cpu with 8 cores 16
threads it's an absolute monster
a face clock of 3.6 turbo into 4
gigahertz it ties the 69 hundred K in
Cinebench single threaded applications
and they actually did a multi-threaded
application in the same program and
found a 9% boost in score with the 1800
X over the 69 hundred K and the final
demo they showed off was a comparison
between an r7 1800 X and again the 6100
K in Sniper Elite where the system was
basically rocking to our X 480 s in
crossfire and they essentially showed
again a side-by-side comparison on the
screen all we saw was the little
framerate counter it wasn't an A to B
compare
in terms of the gameplay was being
displayed so it was hard to kind of
gauge a one-to-one comparison but they
both seem that they seem very comparable
but for the most part it seemed like
they were still in the same 70 to 80 FPS
range at 4k which is pretty good so you
can definitely get a premium gaming
experience with something like the 1800
X now that is going to be coming in at
$500 MSRP that's less than half the
price of a 69 hundred K and beats the
crap out of it in certain applications
I shouldn't say beats the crap out of it
it's probably not a landslide but still
it's a landslide victory when you can
when you consider price to performance
no doubt so we're gonna it'll be
interesting to see how Intel responds in
their own way with perhaps some price
cuts in the near future the nub of r7
processors from AMD is gonna be
launching March 2nd but you can
pre-order them right now at the time of
seeing this video that means pre-orders
should be open today from up to 185
different retailers and boutique OMS
around the globe so very exciting stuff
here the last thing I want to mention is
a dbid confirm that there's going to be
six or seven dozen a.m. for motherboards
though they're gonna be available at
launch so you'll have plenty of options
to choose from and you can get building
your a m4 platform computer as soon as
the launch comes around but that's
pretty much all the information I have
for you guys though this was a very
simple basic straightforward video so
hopefully that's alright but thank you
all so much for tuning in I'll be sure
to keep a close eye on Rison as it comes
so they do it for more tech stuff coming
at you really soon guys be sure to LIKE
the video if you enjoyed I got to get
the hell out of here and continue on
with the rest of the festivities at this
event but thank you all so much I
appreciate it how's it going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
