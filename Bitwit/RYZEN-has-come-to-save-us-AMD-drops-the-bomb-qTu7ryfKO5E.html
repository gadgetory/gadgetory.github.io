channel today I am reporting to you from
San Francisco California at the AMD
press event where they have just
unveiled a bunch of juicy details about
their long-awaited family of Rison CPUs
based on the send architecture and you
guys have been waiting for this
information for a long time and I think
you guys are going to be fairly
impressed with the information I'm about
to share with you I do have a lot of
stuff to do right after this and I'm
pretty pressed for time so I'm going to
make this quick and to the point
hopefully you guys don't mind so just
diving right in here disrupt was a big
word in this president that AMD kept
throwing around because they are really
trying to disrupt the market with the
news and family of CPUs and I believe
they are going to based on the prices
and the specs that they have outlined in
today's press event all of the rise in
seven chips all three of them that are
confirmed right now we're going to
feature a course on 16 threads so SMT of
course and by the way all of the
processors in the Verizon family are
going to have unlocked multipliers which
kind of keeps the trend that we've seen
in the past from AMD
now the first key that they talked about
was the r7 1700's that's kind of these
is a base model within our seven that's
got a boost clock I'm sorry a base clock
of three get your hairdos 23.7 that's a
65 watt TDP and we're going to see a
according to the benchmarks 46 percent
over the 7700 K instead of inch
multi-touch explains buzz explained by
the fact that we've got that yeah four
more cores and eight more threads than
the core i7 cabling processor
additionally they showed us a handbrake
demo between the 1700 and the 7700 K
handbrake again being a multi-threaded
encoding application and we basically
saw the 1700 render the so it was a
fairly small file but it did render than
14 percent less time than the 7700 K and
of course that's going to save you tons
more time if you're dealing with larger
files the last time well they showed us
what the r7 1700 was a game and live
stream setup where you they basically
had a MOBA playing and they were
streaming that out at I don't know if it
was at 720p or 1080i and not exactly
sure of the encoding settings work but
they had that stacked against the 7700 K
once again on the intel side and
basically it would like night and day
the Intel demo was choppy it was there
was clearly an amount of latency that
was virtually unplayable whereas on the
right hand side it was buttery smooth
all the way through and they ended up
calculating that the 7700 K system only
delivered 82 percent of the total frames
for that stream as opposed to 100
percent with the rise in setup so that's
pretty impressive as well the next cue
on the line up is the r7 1700 X and this
has a base clock of 3.4 turbo's 23.8
with a 95 watt TDP so a little bit
higher now and probably a little bit
more commanding in the thermal
department i completely forgot to tell
you the price of the r7 1700 let me
rewind the price of the r7 1700 is three
hundred and twenty nine dollars us which
undercuts the 7700 K by about $20 MSRP
depending on where you're shopping but
that's very impressive considering the
benchmarks that we've seen so far now
back to the 70 1700 X they tested this
against the thousand dollar sixty nine
hundred K which was 99 percent slower
instant offense multi-threaded the 1700
X was 37% faster I'm sorry 39 percent
faster than the 6800 K which is a $500
CPU instant venture multi-threaded as
well and this processor will come in at
just $400 which again undercuts the
Intel equivalent the 1600 K and finally
the processor that many of you have been
raving and ranting about for a long time
out is the 1800 X which is of course
AMD's flagship Rison cpu with 8 cores 16
threads an absolute monster a base clock
of 3.6 ER going to 4 gigahertz it ties
the 69 hundred K in Cinebench single
threaded applications and they actually
did a multi-threaded application in the
same program and found a 9% boost in
score with the 1800 x over the 69
hundred K and the final demo they showed
off was a comparison between an r7 1800
X and again the 6100 K in Sniper Elite
where the system was basically rocked
into our X 480 s in crossfire and they
essentially showed again a side-by-side
comparison
the screen I'll always saw that the
little framerate counter it wasn't an A
to D comparison in terms of the game
flame was being displayed so it was hard
to kind of gauge a one-to-one comparison
but they both seemed that they seemed
very comparable but for the most part it
seemed like they were still in the same
70 to 80 FPS range 4k which is pretty
good so you can definitely get a premium
gaming experience with something like
the 1800 X now that is going to be
coming in at $500 MSRP that's less than
half the price of a 6900 Kay and beats
the crap out of it in certain
applications
I shouldn't say beat the crap out of it
it's probably not a landslide but still
it's a landslide victory when you can
when you consider price to performance
no doubt so we're going to it'll be
interesting to see how Intel responds in
their own way with perhaps when price
cuts in the near future the up of r7
processors from AMD is going to be
launching March 2nd but you can
pre-order them right now at the time of
seeing this video that means pre-orders
should be open today from up to 185
different retailers and boutique o AMS
around the globe so very exciting stuff
here the last thing I want to mention is
a I did confirm that though it's going
to be six or seven dozen a.m. for
motherboards so they're gonna be
available at launch they will have
plenty of options to choose from and you
can get building your am for platform
computer as soon as the launch comes
around but that's pretty much all the
information I have for you guys know
this was a very simple basic
straightforward video so hopefully
that's alright but thank you all so much
for tuning in I'll be sure to keep a
close eye on Rison as it comes so did
you have more tech stuff coming at you
really soon guys be sure to LIKE the
video if you enjoyed I got to get the
hell out of here and continue on with
the rest of the festivities at this
event but thank you all so much
I appreciate it how's it going okay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
