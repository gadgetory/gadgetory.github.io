awesomesauce news as promised this is
the GTX 780 Ti benchmark video and if
you guys haven't already seen it you can
go check out my first look / overview of
the 780 Ti where I basically just go
over some of the specifications as well
as the hardware of the card if you
already saw that video that's probably
what led you here
today I'm gonna be testing the card both
at 1920 by 1080 as well as 2560 by 1600
resolutions and I'll be testing it
against three other high-end cards that
are pretty much in the same ballpark as
far as performance go but before we get
into the actual performance numbers why
don't we take a look at the hardware
that I'm using it's all the hardware
that I'm using is operating out of an
open-air testbed it's rockin an i7 39 70
X clocked at 4500 megahertz
it's being cooled by a coolant master
site in 120 X L it's got an Asus Rampage
4 formula motherboard 16 gigs of g-scale
Triton X clocked at 16 I'm sorry 1866
mega transfers per second I got my OS
and all my applications and games stored
on a 256 gig SSD from SanDisk 1600 watt
Hercules power supply from a Rosewill
and it is running the windows 7 ultimate
64-bit operating system as far as
drivers go I'm using the beta driver
that Nvidia gave me to do this the
testing for the GTX 780 Ti which is a
330 1.7 0 beta driver for all the other
cards of them comparing this card
against I'm just using the current and
most up-to-date drivers that are found
on both the AMD and NVIDIA cites
respectively the video card the main
event of course is a 780ti I'm not going
to go over those specs really because I
mentioned them I talked about them in
the other video but down below there you
can see the other reference benchmark
GPUs that I compared the 780 Ti to which
are the GTX 780 the GTX Titan and the r9
290x the first test Iran was battlefield
4 at Ultra settings for both resolutions
and this is this is exciting stuff
because we're kind of moving away from
battlefield 3 into this newer game with
a newer engine and it's a bit more
taxing on your hardware and that's
that's kind of exciting for us bench
markers here and for you guys I'm sure
so if you take a look at the results
here you can see the 780 Ti pulling
ahead of the competition by quite a
margin actually at 1080 which isn't too
surprising given all the beefed up specs
that it has on that gk110 over the Titan
and the 780
but didn't get quite as far ahead at
1600 but still by about 4 frames over
the 290 X which performed also very well
at battlefield 4
at 1080 and 42.5 at 1600 just above the
Titan as well as the 780 kind of
trailing off there at the end you can
see the max temps in red to the right of
the video cards the 780ti really didn't
get much hotter than 83 degrees Celsius
at any given time in any of the tests
that I ran I did get a little bit cooler
I think for 3d mark which is one of the
tests we're gonna look at later but for
the other tests as you'll see they all
pretty much stayed at around 83 and
that's you know that's I guess that's
what that card is rated to run at and
it's perfectly fine it's definitely not
quite as alarming as the 290x
temperature that it runs at at 94
degrees but of course the AMD is said
that it's safe to run at that that
temperature and it's it's not gonna
diminish the life of the GPU you know
that whatever remains in question as
long as the GPU safe that's cool but
there's still the issue of well it might
generate more heat inside of your
chassis and get your other components
hotter than they'd like to be and that's
of course you know just just a matter of
how good your cooling is inside of your
chassis and how much heat you're willing
to accept in that configuration but I'm
talking too much about the 290x now this
is about the 780 Ti we're moving on to
BioShock Infinite once again the 780ti
in the lead nothing too surprising here
I'm not not too much to say other than
the 718 the 290x kind of neck-and-neck
in this test Crysis 3 we see once again
the 780 Ti wins yes it's getting old now
we get the point
but you can see they're worth pointing
out the 290 X on the 780 are exactly
neck-and-neck at 1920 by 1080 and
actually when we get to the higher res
at 1600 you can see more of a level
playing field here between the 780ti the
titan and the 290x all getting around 30
to 32 frames per second with the 780
trailing off there at the end at around
28 frames per second the next test I ran
was a Metro last light and here we can
see sort of an uprising with the 290x
taking the crown over the other Nvidia
cards and that's kind of interesting to
me because to my knowledge Metro last
light is pretty much predominantly an
Nvidia title I know in video worked with
the developers to kind of optimize
drivers and that sort of thing but here
still nonetheless we see the 290x
taking the lead over over the Nvidia
cards and that's kind of cool to see the
780ti and the Titan pretty much neck and
neck right there at 1080 and when we
take a look at 2560 by 1600 we see the
780 Ti pull ahead ever so slightly but
290x and the gtx titan 3d mark was the
last test that I ran and it's the only
synthetic benchmark test that I ran
against these cards I did do it on
Xtreme though so it's extremely taxing
on your hardware and if you look at the
performance numbers it's kind of cool to
just see these numbers go up and up with
every new GPU launch that AMD or in
video release and you can see there five
one two five four the graphics core just
barely topping out or beating out the
290x and well above these scores that'd
be Titan and the GTX 780 were able to
achieve and if you look at the bottom
left you can see that the GTX 780 Ti
didn't even get too hot it only got up
to 77 degrees Celsius max which tells me
that it could have been pushed even a
bit further before hitting its temp
target of 83 degrees so those are all
the benchmarks that I have for you today
for the GTX 780 Ti and given the results
that you've seen today which video card
would you be more inclined to go with
given the option of the 780 Ti the 780
or the r9 290x from AMD all all things
considered price performance and the
features you get with each of those
cards which one would you go if leave me
