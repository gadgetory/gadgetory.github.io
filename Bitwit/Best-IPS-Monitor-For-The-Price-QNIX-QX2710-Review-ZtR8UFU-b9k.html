my brand new 27-inch 2560 by 1440
monitor which arrived on my doorstep
last week straight from Korea this is
the Kuhn excuse to 710 and it's very
comparable to other popular korean
panels that are being sold in the US
right now for dirt cheap like the yama
kasi cat league for example now I've
been in the market for a high-res
monitor for a long time now but with all
these high-end video cards coming out
like the r9 290x and the GTX 780 Ti I
knew I needed to pull the trigger on a
high res panel ASAP if I wanted to
continue running relevant benchmarks at
resolutions that most appropriately
reflect what these cards can handle the
reason I decided to go with a 16 by 9
panel instead of opting for 2560 by 1600
is a most of the Korean panels only
offer 1440 whereas the options for 1600
screens are much more limited B I like
the idea of evenly scaling my benchmarks
going from 1080 to 1440 I don't know why
it just makes sense to me and see the
simple truth is that I just prefer 16 by
9 monitors because I like the wider
field of view and in playing games and
the widescreen look when watching
blu-rays if you're wondering why I
decided to go with a Korean panel well
the truth is I almost did it
I was clicks away from buying an Asus PB
2 7 8 Q but in the end I went with the
communiques because even though I'd be
losing some of the convenient features
on the Asus monitor they weren't worth
paying the extra $200 I picked up my
mother on new egg for 350 bucks and I've
been feeling guilty for not paying more
money for it ever since
it's that good of a deal so that's that
I'm quickly going to go over what comes
included besides the monitor itself it
has the stand power cord dual link DVI
cable 3.5 millimeter analog audio cable
and in manual entirely in Korean now to
reiterate it's 27 inches at 2560 by 1440
resolution and at the time of buying
this monitor I thought it was IPS but
the Newegg website actually claims it to
be a pls panel which stands for playing
to line switching if you're familiar
with pls it's a technology from Samsung
that's very similar to IPS in regards to
color reproduction and viewing angle but
it's able to output a bit more
brightness while consuming less power
and it's marginally cheaper than its IPS
brethren I stare into IPS panels all day
at work and I can't even tell the
difference between one of those monitors
and this one
neither one seems brighter to me or has
noticeably better color resolution than
the other
now just like IPS panels pls panels do
have slower response times because their
LEDs can't rapidly snap into position
like they do on TN panels the QX to 710
has a
time of eight milliseconds but before
you gamers pull out your pitchforks I've
been playing battlefield 4 on this panel
with motion blur disabled for the last
week or so and I haven't noticed any
ghosting everything is super sharp and
crystal clear and with the high
resolution I can even afford to disable
some of the filters to get more frames
and the game still looks amazing the
Mater has a 60 Hertz refresh rate which
means it's not quite as sharp as my 144
Hertz vg2 7-8 when there's really fast
movement on the screen but the
difference is only noticeable if I
immediately switch from 144 to 60
otherwise I completely forget about it
because I'm blown away by how much
insanely better the color looks speaking
of which the wide colour spectrum of
this panel can be appreciated within a
170 degree viewing angle one factor I'm
basing this review on is the overall
condition of the monitor from the
packaging to the physical condition of
the panel itself right out of the box I
was pretty happy with the packaging the
box came wrapped in this sort of thin
foam enclosure to help absorb any shock
and I had a fragile sticker on it which
was hopefully legible by both Koreans
and Americans the retail box was in
average condition had some minor creases
and scuffs about it but nothing really
traumatic enough to raise concern for
the monitor inside the monitor was held
securely inside the box with large foam
pieces on either side I guess that's
pretty standard packaging protocol these
days and upon taking a first look at the
monitor itself the only stuff I could
find was on the fake button thingy in
the bottom right corner of the bezel
this button literally doesn't do
anything in fact it can't even be pushed
inwards but it did have a small scratch
on it and a little scuff on the side
it's a harsh world but I think I'll live
after having survived all that I finally
powered it up and face my greatest fear
of buying a Korean panel dead pixels to
my surprise there actually was only one
I did a white background test and I
could only find one off to the left side
of the screen and after I spotted it for
the first time I haven't noticed it
since
unless I'm actively looking for it I
know this might bother some of you pixel
perfectionists out there but considering
the 6000 miles this monitor traveled to
get to my doorstep one small scuff and
dead pixel eang bad now in case you're
colorblind or just plain blind this
monitor is black it has a plastic bezel
that's about an inch and a half thick
and it does have a glossy finish which
I'm not the biggest fan of I can accept
it however since I generally use my
desktop in low-light anyway and I don't
have any heavy sunlight hitting this
part of my room so solar beams aren't
constantly being reflected into my
retina
along the bottom of the monitor runs a
dark gray strip which is also made of
plastic but strives to give off sort of
a faux brushed aluminum aesthetic it
looks pretty nice oh I remember that
fake button with the scuffs well there
are five more buttons to the left of it
underneath the monitor four of which are
also fake yeah the brightness and the
volume buttons do nothing which makes
the power button the only working
physical button on this panel this is
most likely because the company didn't
want to manufacture a new housing for
these panels so they just recycled the
ones that they already had that were
used for other models that actually
featured volume and brightness
adjustment lucky for me the brightness
of this panel is already where I'd like
it to be and I have no interest in using
built-in monitor speakers for as long as
I live the screen itself has a matte
finish so it hardly picks up any
reflections at all but if you choose to
pick up any Korean panel from eBay or
New Ager anywhere make sure you know
what kind of screen you're getting
because a lot of them feature that
horrendous tempered glass display which
makes me want to vomit and I'm sure the
same goes for many of you the backplate
of the monitor has a textured plastic
construction and there's a 100 by 100
base amount so you can always buy a
dedicated monitor stand if you're not
happy with the one that's included
speaking of which the included stand is
made from the same glossy plastic as the
bezel and unfortunately only offers tilt
functionality and this is my biggest
gripe with this panel is with all of the
Korean panels for that matter is the
same stiff wobbly stand and I maybe I'm
just used to the awesome stand of my VG
278 and sure the Kunik stand gets the
job done but that's it
there's no overachieving in this
particular area and honestly if it
wasn't for the vase amount option on the
back I probably would have thought twice
before buying this panel on the back
right side of the monitor is a power
port analog audio jack and the only
video input for this panel being a dual
link DVI port now this is something to
be mindful of guys because in order for
this monitor to display properly it
needs to be connected to a dual link DVI
digital output so check the back of your
video card because a single link DVI
connection won't work now I haven't
tried using any adapters with this panel
but based on the other Korean monitors
I've seen my guess is that unless you
shell out the hundred plus dollars for a
powered active converter those won't
work either it's also pretty obvious
that if you plan on connecting multiple
video sources to your monitor don't buy
this one because the one video input is
all you get
for me personally 95% of the video cards
that benchmark have dual link DVI deport
and I don't intend on hooking up
anything else to my monitor for the time
being so that definitely helped me get
over this otherwise deal breaking
limitation the last category for this
review is performance and it's probably
the category that this monitor scores
the highest in I mean the color
resolution is just out of control the
colors aren't oversaturated at all so
while the color on my TN panel looks a
bit more vibrant it's also just
exaggerated and it looks artificial
being a pls panel the Q mix has this
vast color spectrum so you get
significantly greater color accuracy
skin tones on people look natural and
objects are more easily visible in
low-light scenes it just brings people
and environments to life in a way that
you just can't get on a TN and this is
true for both gaming and HD video
playback as I mentioned before the
refresh rate and the response time is
something I haven't had a problem with
yet but after several hours of
battlefield 4 and countless scenes from
one to many Michael Bay movies I don't
think I ever will and of course
everyone's eyes are different so all of
this ultimately boils down to personal
preference but that's just how I feel
about it
overall I have to save the additional
screen real estate and the massive image
quality boost has made it really hard
for me to go back to my 1080 TN panel at
work not that I play games or watching
movies at work anyway to sum things up
the qx2 710 has some shortcomings that
will inevitably be deal-breakers for
some of you but if you can get past the
bad stand and the lack of video inputs
this monitor will give you just about
the best image quality that you can find
at this size and resolution for under
400 bucks
and for that I'm giving it a 9 out of 10
and my first ever felon award given to a
product whose price to performance ratio
is so good that when you buy one it
feels like you got away with murder let
me know what you guys think of the panel
in the comments below and be sure to
like or dislike the video accordingly
