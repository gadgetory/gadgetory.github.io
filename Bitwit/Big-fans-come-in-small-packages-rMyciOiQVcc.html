brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below go Coco how
later we pretty late like half an hour
yeah yeah when she's not talkin to them
easier you're really late
are we lost we just got here when in
doubt never be too proud to ask for
directions J skill looking fly again
this year I see but this video is not
about you look all the Ellen to Chris
all the Ellen to Coolermaster hey we
made it look for who Jaime Jaime is our
point of contact at coolermaster we need
to find her before we can start shooting
though she is high coolermaster has
finally begun therefore right into
wireless peripherals at least for the
gaming segment this is the brand new mm
831 gaming mouse it's got a laser sensor
very high quality armor on switches
millions of clicks are supported even up
to 32,000 dpi with this guy which is
more than enough for most people we also
have two options here you can connect
either via bluetooth or wirelessly over
a 2.4 gigahertz connection very nice as
a pairing button right there very nice
comfortable shape feels very good in the
hand we have a PBT plastic housing also
very high quality there's a cover cover
pops out alright it's kind of blinding
but this actually gives you housing for
the little wireless dongle
I hate wireless mice that don't have
this feature because it makes those
dongles very easy to lose you can also
charge it with this little cable is this
seat oh good job coolermaster type-c you
can actually charge it while you use it
which is very nice also wireless keytar
geing so if you have something like this
like their new wireless Qi charging
stand you can just leave it on their
charge is no problem you can also use
this guy for charging your phone
assuming that it's supported with Qi
charging we also have the sk8 5 1 these
are wireless bluetooth keyboards very
nice super sleek you can actually see
they're significantly sleeker and
thinner than their existing low profile
keyboards also notice the switches are
different these are using the Cherry MX
low profile switches whereas these are
on Ron's brand-new Japanese source low
profile switches they come in two
varieties that you can choose from elite
linear and tactile I prefer I personally
like the tactile these are tactile right
here and they feel I actually like them
better than these a low key haha pun
intended
you got multimedia function keys 10 key
number pad also comes in your choice of
black or white since these are
prototypes they're not powered right now
but eventually these are going to be
fully equipped with perky RGB lighting
of course they do look very classy very
minimalistic if you want to switch
things up however Coolermaster is gonna
be really releasing three sets of custom
key caps at least initially and they
probably will have plans to roll out
more options in the future but they look
really nice it's kind of like you know
Coolermaster color themed right here you
can get fancy with it of course you can
swap them around if you wanted to paint
them whatever brand them yourself it's a
bunch of possibilities here here we have
the MH 670 their first wireless headset
this is actually really nice super
comfortable we've got the memory foam
whole other year cups
unidirectional boom microphone we also
have a very sleek design here there's no
RGB on this one which I actually like it
also increases battery life again I
think 22 hours of continuous battery
life usage which is pretty darn good we
also have a 2.4 gigahertz wireless
connection very similar to the m83 one
these also feature virtual 7.1 surround
sound if you're into that sort of thing
I tried them on they're extremely
comfortable very cushiony and relatively
lightweight so you can wear them for
hours on end hopefully have without too
much discomfort I also really like the
fact that you can plug them in analog if
your battery dies or if you just want
lossless audio very nice this is the MM
710 that says not a wireless mouse but
I'm going to talk about it briefly
anyway it's extremely lightweight
I think it's under 51 or 52 grams it's
like fifty one point something grams
it's incredibly light I don't think I've
ever held a mouse that's white you can
see that they've actually cut out a lot
of the plastic housing just to reduce
the weight even further it's very
comfortable it's a little bit on the
smaller side so if you have a large hand
it might not be for you but definitely
if your palm grip or a smaller rest grip
user you should be perfectly
accommodated switches are very fast very
clicky very tactile like the MM a 3-1
this also has a very high-quality laser
sensor at 32,000 dpi
theft is a very weird sounding word but
it's actually an acronym for cooler
masters new line of power supply's
thermal enhanced platform actually I
guess this is the line X G X G gold
essential advance and plus obviously it
scales up from left to right but these
are basically designed around the idea
of a very high efficiency so at low
temperatures they're gonna be running
cooler than your typical power supply
units they're doing this in a variety of
ways they actually have an internal look
here just to give you an example
for starters they've redesigned the
entire DC to DC circuit in house
everything's in house here we also have
a redesigned transformer that's
extremely high efficiency and over here
you can see we actually have machined
soldering that they've integrated for
the manufacturing process just to ensure
no human error and utmost precision in
the crafting of these beautiful units
you can see that this one's got RGB
lighting I think there's a prototype so
I don't know if this is final retail or
anything but digital readout there so
you can see at a glance here system
Diagnostics how much power you're drying
from the wall and that sort of thing
there's also software options they
didn't really go over that with me too
extensively but there's a bunch of
different options that you can do here
we can change the oh it's like you can
have some fun with what you actually
display on that LCD this is a really
interesting concept this is still very
much a prototype so nothing's final here
yet but Project familis power supplies
for example this is going to ship with
this bracket that's a you know included
and it's not going to have a fan from
the get-go okay so without a fan it's
going to be 650 Watts 80 plus Platinum
certified full aluminum housing it's
actually a really nice kind of it looks
like a giant heatsink but very cool
however if you were to add any fan
pretty much any fan that's at least 1500
rpm and four pin PWM and 120 millimeters
this automatically becomes a 1000 watt
supported power supply still retaining
its a B+ Platinum efficiency which is a
very cool concept that I have not seen
before so again I hope they bring this
to market so you can test it out and
stuff have some fun with it but it's
very cool you can add your own fan and
obviously expand the power significantly
almost twofold by simply adding a fan
that additional cooling will be able to
leverage that power very effectively SL
600 M I really loved this case this is
the case that I used for pin my rig last
episode pin my rig but now it's in black
that's that's pretty much it it's now
black it's very nice
anodized and
and black kind of a matte finish it's
super sexy
I want one look sinister it looks like
it's ready to break a GPU in half
I hope not though save the GPUs we've
got a couple new yo-yos here this is the
master liquid ml 240p mirage these fans
are pretty cool you can stop right here
you can see that the blades are actually
connected that's supposed to help with
additional airflow and potentially keep
them quieter very nicely poses and you
kind of look at this impeller you can
see the impeller there it's kind of got
a mirage effect which is where it gets
its name from and RGB LED of course it's
Dressel to me but never mind that
look at this look at this if you thought
that was cool this must be twice as cool
pun intended because it has two of the
exact same pumps integrated into one
single housing you can see the tubing
here this is a prototype so you might
not be able to see the tubes or they
might actually make them clear so they
are more visible and I don't know maybe
add some more to be there as well I'm
not sure but pretty wicked right I guess
the point of having two pumps here is
it's going to increase the actual flow
rate if you're cool it increase the
pressure and the rate at which it
actually dissipates heat so that's gonna
be effective we're lowering your
temperatures even further very nice
stressful RGB fans there this is a 240
millimeter radiator it looks like but
they may have plans to do a 360 I hope
they do for something this extensive I
would be kind of wasted on just 240 be
nice to have that additional option we
also have this guy master liquid ml 240p
vivid again with those RGB fans and
they're just trying to give me a seizure
right now I love the LCD screen on here
because it's the biggest one I have ever
seen on any AIO
2.4 4 inches fully customizable has a
bunch of different metrics we're all
kind of familiar with that but this is I
think going to be the largest LCD on any
i/o currently on the market master
liquid ml 240 M mirage DIY alright
there's gonna be a DIY kit it's gonna
get your foot into the door to custom
water cooling if you're I don't know if
you're a little intimidated by trying to
find out which parts are all compatible
this is still pending they're not sure
if they're gonna use this water block or
change it I think they can change it
make it more RGB and translucent just so
that it matches the other parts of 3rd
they've already settled on including the
reservoir here which has a really wicked
looking tornado effects I'm hoping that
doesn't add or introduce air bubbles
into your loops it kind of looks like it
is
air bubbles yeah that's gonna have to
get tested for sure
so yeah DIY kit pretty cool this might
be one of the coolest things I have here
quite literally immersion cooling case
so it's using immersion cooling this is
3m s special non conductive coolant but
they're actually filling this entire
case with this is actually great for
small form-factor because if you don't
have the actual space needed to fit
radiators and pumps and reservoirs well
just fill it up with liquid directly and
have it make direct contact with all the
with all those main components it's
actually pretty sweet this is not how
it's actually going to ship its gonna
have this cover on it they just took it
off for demo purposes so you can
actually see the inside this is the
finished finished finish up on it though
it's gonna be like silver and very
industrial looking very cool got a 240
millimeter radiator with a couple fans
on top as well no price point on this
but we should be seeing this relatively
soon maybe in the next decider no
actually not I should I take that back
maybe not soon they didn't they didn't
say maybe they didn't I forgot at any
rate I'm very excited to get one of
these in the studio elevates this is a
RGB GPU bracket they went there mr. fan
MF 120 M addressable RGB fans notice
that the center Center hub is not
spinning a cool little effect there we
do have addressable RGB on the edges I
get the point of this middle thing that
to not spin is just more clean and I
don't know it's just it's just a cleaner
look it's guy LEDs yeah you know you
could actually see the logo if you're if
you're a huge fan of the cooler master
logo these are the fans for you and then
we also have their their SF 120 M fans
these are my favorite fans that they
have here oh oh
double ball-bearing got double
ball-bearing fans know RGB whatsoever
they're supposed to be just super
industrial and blacked out they also
have the same design where all the the
blades are connected very nice brush
metal fish here rubberized corners so
reduce noise and vibration there there's
also a switch somewhere here it's kind
of hard to see but there's gonna be a
3-step switch for various rpm speed so
you can actually change it on the fly
based on hardware
you can do it software as well but
sometimes it's kind of nice to have a
physical switch on board this little guy
right here is the H 100 okay it's like a
miniature H 500 M in my opinion we've
got the full front mesh it's very nice
large 200 millimeter RGB fan and once
the mesh of the top to so it comes the
very full puppet through this thing
they're saying that this is really
targeted for like the APU users which I
guess makes sense because you can only
fit up to 160 millimeter discrete GPUs
not that's going to stop me from
cramming one in there I was like a mini
RT X 27 or something like that but these
are these pretty sweet
only like 16 I think it's like 60 or 70
bucks or something like that fairly
affordable much lower than I was
actually expecting there's also a handle
right here that you can actually carry
very easily nothing that's too heavy to
begin with even if it's fully kitted out
also a full-size ATX power supply
support it's actually pretty nice add
some additional flexibility and hardware
support but you can probably get one of
those s FX adapters in there as well if
you wanted to put a smaller power supply
for additional room the cable management
and maybe a bit more breathability look
at these tiny little coolers G 200 P G
400 P alright these these are really
nice especially if you're doing a super
small form-factor bill 40 millimeters
ultra low-profile small form-factor
optimized 92 millimeter RGB fan of
course gotta go RGB this is like it
might be a competitor to the super low
profile not to a cooler l9 high whatever
it is you guys know what I'm talking
about might be cool to do a cooler
shootout on those two as well G 400 P is
a little bit taller but of course you
get a little bit more cooling because of
it I believe this is a fifty fifty eight
fifty eight millimeters it's also got a
92 millimeter RGB fan be sure to look
out for these very soon 3 D BBC
technology so those are not heat pipes
you can see that big copper slab that
goes like in two towers like two planks
that's actually doing a lot of the
thermal dissipation a lot of the heat
transfer I should say
and it basically reduces the amount of
resistance within the fence back within
those fins so you actually get much
faster rate of heat dissipation from the
fans blowing out and overall it's going
to reduce your temperatures a bit
further overall it also gives it a very
clean look you don't really see heat
pipes you see those white kind of black
anodized slabs which looks kind of cool
thanks Jamie this is fun we'll see you
later bye all right stay cool oh why the
convention center for one booth and now
we're out of it again we're crossing the
street why why are we why are we leaving
already
what the hell where are we going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
