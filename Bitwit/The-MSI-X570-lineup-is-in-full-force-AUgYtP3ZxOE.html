brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
Corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below
ok naturally we're gonna check out X 570
boards from all the vendors we can and
here we have MS is offering so we're
gonna start off with their sort of entry
level or I should say mid-range boards
first these are gonna obviously be the
most affordable just giving you the
essential features that most gamers are
gonna want none of the features that you
probably don't need that you're gonna
definitely have to pay extra for so for
service we have the MGP X 570 gaming
edge Wi-Fi and next to that is the MP GX
570 gaming Pro carbon Wi-Fi and these
are going to be very similarly priced
with just some of my new differences
between the two you can see this one
actually has black and red accents so if
you're planning to go for a
distinctively red color scheme there
might be an option here we have a bit
more color neutral design obviously the
aesthetics are going to be the probably
the biggest difference between these two
boards each board also has one nvme PCIe
gen3 m2 SSD slot which is nice to have
if you kind of look here that you could
actually see the i/o cover is is
relatively large it's a heatsink and it
looks to be all metallic it's all
aluminum so it's actually functionally
cooling down some of the VRM you can see
it extends well beyond just the the
actual vrm portion here just to get more
surface area and additional heat
dissipation X 570 is prone to getting
much hotter than X 470 after all that's
why we have active cooling fans as well
I'm gonna talk more about these fans in
just a little bit as we scale up to the
higher quality boards or the more
expensive boards I should say bump in
one step up we have the MP GX 570 gaming
Pro carbon Wi-Fi this is of course I got
some carbon-fiber inlays right there
very very sporty looking you can see
that we actually have 2 m2 slots on this
guy again both of them PCIe 10-4 chipset
fan and you can see the heatsink
configuration across this whole area of
the board is a bit more substantial and
robust than some of the cheaper options
can't forget our GB got it got a lot of
RGB here we have the Meg x5 78
this thing is pretty beautiful
especially if you're trying to go for a
black and gold theme system here you can
see we actually get to eight pin EPS 12
volt connectors for our CPU which is
going to be awesome if you're dropping
in a higher four count CPU into this
board which is really what it's targeted
for with AMD's announcement though
they're gonna be going up to 12 and
potentially even 16 cores on rising
3,000 CPUs you're gonna want more power
delivery cleaner power the VRMs are a
bit more beefed up actually
significantly beefed up on these boards
compared to the ones we just looked at
so if you're going for Hyper eight core
rise in 3000 CPUs this board is going to
be very well suited for the job we also
get one two three PCI a Gen 4 M two
slots
I believe this board also includes a
PCIe card that will give you two more m
dot u slots so giving you a total of
five drives and I believe you can raid
those together to get some really insane
numbers that we've seen earlier you can
see we also have Wi-Fi six onboard I
spies flashback and clear CMOS buttons
on the back are very handy feature to
have few other features we were familiar
with seeing on high-end mmsi boards like
surface mount power reset a handy little
overclocking knob if you don't want to
fiddle around too much of the BIOS and
we have a troubleshooting debug LED as
well this isn't even the highest end
board that they have here though if you
come over here we have the M eg or the
Meg god like this this is where it's at
okay this is this is if you're dropping
in a sixteen core you want absolutely
zero compromise the BRM setup is a
fourteen plus four plus one power phase
delivery absolutely insane like the ACE
motherboard we have three M two slots
here also comes included with that that
PCIe Gen four PCI Express card that I
was mentioning earlier the m2 expander
that's what the card looks like right
there this board also comes with a 10
Gigabit Ethernet LAN card slots right
into your board which is super great for
networking purposes additionally I think
there's a one gigabit and five gigabit
port already pre-built into them into
the board as well so still really nice
transfer speeds there there's an LCD
screen here they didn't really mention
that too much but I would imagine it's
configurable maybe you can put something
a bit more useful on there like system
Diagnostics thermal voltage and is this
a mirror this is just a mirror you know
in case you need to get ready for a
party or something no this is probably
some kind of flashy RGB oh yeah there's
there's always you be on there it's just
an RGB thing you can also see the
cooling solution on the
here is a bit more beefed up there's
actually a heat pipe running from the
chipset itself to the rest of the BRM so
you're actually getting active cooling
on these areas of the board as well
because of the fan now I told you I'd
circle back to these fans no obviously
having fans on the chipset is not ideal
because at some point the fans are
destined to fail
however MSI is taken some precautions to
make their fans allegedly better than
the competition by introducing things
like double ball bearings so you're
gonna get buzz Jillian hours of lifespan
here they actually be much more reliable
and have much more longevity than the
competition
propeller blade technology which is
gonna aid in cooling as well as noise
there's also a zero frozer technology
that they built into the into the fans
so under a certain power load the fans
are going to spin up at all you can see
it's actually not spinning up at all
right now but that's because the more
it's not powered on really and then
there's also a tuning pin control this
is going to be software based as well so
depending on the load the fan will ramp
up and down seamlessly so that it's not
too distracting but also providing
adequate cooling regardless of the task
at hand and then I'd say potentially the
best for last year we have the prestige
X 570 creation a little bit difficult to
see with all this backlighting but this
board is incredibly over engineered we
have a 14 + 2 phase power design that's
of course 14 for the CPU and 2 for the
ddr4 just beautiful board it has a lot
of nice silver and black accents that
we're used to you can also see that we
have the same key by heat pipe design
that we saw in the godlike that's going
straight from the exercise 70 chipset
all the way to the rest of the vrm so
you're actually getting that same active
cooling from that fan completely across
the board which is a very nice
implementation we have one to three
full-size PCIe gen and it also looks
like we have I believe there's two empty
slots here that are again PCIe gen for
this probably includes I would assume
that it includes the same expansion
cards all that we do get a dual LAN with
a 10 10 gigabit attending via ethernet
which is very nice the other thing I
noticed here is that there's actually
dual USB 3.0 headers 20 pin which is
really nice I like the fact that they're
right next to each other and they're
both right angle that's going to help
clean up cable management quite
significantly of course no word on
pricing yet for any of these boards
although we can expect all of them to
become a
on the day of launch for Rison 3000 so
just around the corner you guys let me
know which boards your favorite I
personally am really into the ACE and
the godlike I think those are the ones I
would reach out for first assuming that
my wallet would what sustain that choice
but you guys let me know what your
preference is down below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
