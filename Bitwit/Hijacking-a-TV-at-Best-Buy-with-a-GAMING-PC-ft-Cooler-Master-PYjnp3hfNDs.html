actually scare you yes you did scare me
well you're pretty easy to scare so I
guess that's not really good oh boy
hello sniff to camera sniff it smells
like vlogging what's going on guys
welcome back so today's vlog is actually
sponsored for the first time ever I've
never done a sponsored vlog before I
don't even know what that means or what
its gonna look like but basically this
video is sponsored by Coolermaster and
the only message they really want me to
convey to you guys is that they're now
selling their new mechanical keyboards
at select Best Buy locations in the
United States they gave me 100% free
creative rein on how I make this video
which was probably a terrible idea on
their head but now I think we can figure
this out if Coolermaster wants to show
off their new keyboards at Best Buy then
why don't we just walk into a random
Best Buy near me and see if the
keyboards are there what better way to
demonstrate the availability of select
mechanical keyboards from Coolermaster
it's like Best Buy locations in the
United States it's a genius idea okay I
admit this is a half-baked plan and it's
probably not gonna go well but at least
it's a plan so I say we just head to
Best Buy right now because quite frankly
I'm sick of walking in circles in my
living room are you ready ready camera
operator for the day whoo YP cam why the
cam shake it out YP can we
okay we made it to the Best Buy we're
here things are looking good so far but
I have not seen any keyboards yet there
are some peripherals
I do see some headsets here mainly for
Xbox I don't know I don't know where the
heck the keyboards would be wait are
these DVDs hold on is this like a joke
I'll they're doing this ironically right
okay keyboards if I were a keyboard in
here where would I be ooh
Oh LEDs they have alleged shiny we look
at the whole LEDs heads look at how
gorgeous this TV is just look at look at
those trains have you ever seen a more
gorgeous train in all your life no the
answer is no you said no you know what
this TV really needs though a gaming PC
lucky for this TV I always come prepared
oh crap power what are we gonna do for
power there's got to be like a power
strip around here somewhere maybe behind
there's an outlet down there alright
this even if the local Best Buy we care
about cable management wifey can you
pull the cable while you're recording
pull the cable through the spot pull it
through there there you go
stop good teamwork you know it's kind of
funny I've gotten scolded many times for
filming inside of a Best Buy and now I'm
getting paid to do it funny how that
works look at this
alright see now Best Buy should actually
just start implementing gaming PC's
connected to all of their display TVs I
think that would really sell them look
at this high-end HTTP see that you can
connect to your OLED oh it doesn't sound
good
not a pleasant sound that's the sound of
the radiator fan hitting the power
supply cables I must have gotten moved
around when we came over here
I didn't bring a screwdriver you need a
screwdriver to open the side panel for
this case where on earth are we gonna
get a screwdriver right now
I got a screwdriver from the back talk
to one of the guys who works here and he
was able to hook it up I'm not exactly
sure if he knew what I'm doing here but
he was very nice so I got a screwdriver
yay only gripe about the damn case is
that does require two Phillips head
screws close properly and you think to
yourself well I'd never be in a
situation where I'd have to crack open
my side panel and not have access to a
screwdriver because most likely you'd be
at home but you know we're gonna invade
BestBuy and dick around for a while of
course it helps to have Tula century
alright so I see the cable that's
touching the fan blade I'm just gonna
sort of push it up with the screwdriver
until it's out of the way that's all it
took pop this back on now we can finally
boot this thing without any issues and
if all goes well presto we are now just
one steam logging away from gaming on
this OLED although we don't have a
keyboard shit the keyboard I'm supposed
to be doing a keyboard video right now
let's get the keyboard and do what we
came here to do do I get distracted
easily does this happen often I'm gonna
go get the keyboard I'll be right back
okay okay I think I'm getting warm
warmer more graphics card nope
don't get this dragon Kyle alright
cooler master cooler master this is CK 5
5 - this is the one this is the one
they're talking about Hey look at that
mechanical switches how much is this
thing $80 it's actually not too bad for
a mechanical keyboard with a 10 key
number pad alright so I'll take one of
those is there anything else from
Coolermaster here Oh what is this and
then 531 gaming mouse also RGB it must
be good
sure whatever seriously though it's kind
of nice to see brands like Coolermaster
that are very PC DIY centric being sold
in retail stores like Best Buy it's one
of the things that brick-and-mortar
stores still have over online no
shipping times see k55 - impromptu
in-store and boxing here we go this is
actually a pretty handsome keyboard look
at that brushed aluminum finish on the
top of the body raised key caps lengthy
rubberized cable and it is fixed to the
keyboard I actually prefer fixed cables
to my keyboards let me see them feet
girl I'm gonna put this keyboard kind of
close to my love Mike did you get to
give you guys
sound test here we go sound good
fairly quiet you could definitely use
them in an office without disrupting
everybody Cherry MX stem so you could
replace these key caps with your own
custom set if you wanted to the switches
are not cherry however they are Gator on
which I'd actually prefer to kale from
personal experience and they feel a lot
nicer in my opinion of course everyone's
gonna be different but it feels nice the
nice thing about these Gator ons is that
you don't have to spend an arm and a leg
to get your hands on a keyboard that
features them whereas you kind of do
with Cherry MX switches they're just so
damn expensive ok I'm ready to plug this
thing in give it a whirl I also kind of
want to see what the RGB looks like oh
you forgot the box oh just just leave it
there I practically own this place now
it's fine come on
alright cool a bastard Mouse going in
sorry competitor Mouse should have
sponsored the video night Baldy is
Friday this is so stupid but kind of
awesome
alright let's kill some demons
it's really quickly when I check out
some of these function keys at the top
row looks like there's sort of like a
breathing pulsating effect the LEDs are
really bright especially for being in a
bright store like this best buy right
now you can see them very clearly you've
amped see we've got some different
preset modes here reactive seizure mode
I'm pretty sure that's what this one's
called the obligatory rainbow wave of
course was this static and then you can
change the colors like so more reactive
typing so it looks like you also have
someone on the fly macro abilities here
with just a few clicks of the keys you
can actually set up your own macros I
believe there's 512 kilobytes of onboard
memory on the keyboard so wherever you
take it you have all your profiles safe
which is pretty cool
windows lucky very important and that is
just tip of the iceberg for all the cool
things as keyboard can do and
whoa what a rush everyone should go out
and play video games at your local Best
Buy just bring your own PC now it's a
terrible idea
don't ever do that but I guess the moral
the story here is that you can now buy a
cooler master ck5 5-2 mechanical
keyboard and select best buy locations
in the United States very exciting to
see brands like this popping up in
brick-and-mortar stores I should also
mention the CK 550 is the exact same
mechanical keyboard as this one except
it has a gray finish that you can
purchase that on Amazon or newegg.com
