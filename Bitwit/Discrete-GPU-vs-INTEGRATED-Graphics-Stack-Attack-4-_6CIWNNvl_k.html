the description to learn more before the
deal ends what's going on guys welcome
back to the channel today we are
bringing you yet another stack attack
this is episode 4 for those of you
unfamiliar the way it works is wyfy
sauce and I go one-on-one today's game
is going to be csgo
arms race whoever wins that is not going
to have to do something awful at the end
of the show wiper sauce will tell you
more about that in a moment also the way
it works is before the match even starts
will be dealing each other four cards at
random that will serve as attacks that
we can play on each other throughout the
the entire match in order to thwart the
other opponent and give ourselves
competitive edge you can only play one
card at a time unless you stack two
cards at the same time so basically what
I mean by that is if one card is a
three-minute duration and I play it on Y
P sauce I have to wait for that three
minutes to be up before I can play a
second card and like I mentioned the
only way to play two cards
simultaneously is to play them at
exactly the same time which will of
course deal a devastating blow to your
coming and whoever loses this challenge
today is gonna have to eat a raw onion
just you know bite into it like a good
old juicy Apple did we get to get with
sriracha or something at the very least
we don't want to answer anything they're
coming to mask the flavor no yeah I mean
the fumes from the onions to make you
cry alone like there's nothing you can
do about it
it'll be hard to tell if they're tears
from the onion or just tears from
sadness but you know you don't have the
best track record honey you've actually
lost every stack attack before this but
today might be your lucky day because
well you're gonna be gaming on a
full-fledged you know gaming desktop of
the gtx 1070 etc i will be gaming on a
relatively low powered apu system in
fact i'll be using the new risin 320 200
g no discrete GPU simply running on
integrated graphics and bear in mind
we're both going to be capturing our
screen play locally to our systems so
that's going to be even more demanding
i've also scaled up to 4k i have a fork
monitor today to bring my framerate even
further down just to give you that just
to give you that slight advantage so
we'll see we'll see we'll see what
happens and Kyle's given me many
advantages and I still managed to lose
so I don't know but you know what so is
so is the performance that I'm probably
gonna see in just a moment here so today
the attack cards that we will be using
are going to be cards from previous
episodes of stack attack and they're
specifically cards that we never got to
play in in the other episodes that we
thought should have been yeah like play
like that they're really sad - not
really the first four that we're going
to use the first one is a devil's candy
and this one basically the opponent that
gets this card has to eat three very
spicy wings yes even though the card
says one wing we're actually modifying
it three and they are vegan wings by the
way so vegan wings that's the real
punishment and then we've got the
witch's cauldron which is basically
bobbing for apples you have to Bob for
two apples before you can resume
gameplay third one that we're bringing
back is called flashbang the player will
have to wear headphones on their ears
while listening to a very high-pitched
ringing noise as well as wearing an
eyepatch over one of their eyes so not
only were the wool they're hearing be
impaired the vision will be slightly
impaired as well sounds terrible yep
then we have mummified we're basically
both players stop gaining temporarily
while the person who played the attack
wraps their opponent in saran wrap like
a mummy and then you have to leave one
hand exposed and then it has to have to
have to leave at least one hand exposed
and then they can resume playing after
that good luck the next four cards are
the new attach that we have come up with
further for this
around the first one is moonwalk
basically the player that has this card
has to can only move backwards got mash
s can't even smell no only backwards
that's your only four movement I mean of
course you can move with your mouse and
that's gonna be for three minutes yep
that's a three minute challenge then we
have oil slick oil slick requires that
the person who's been hit with this
attack increase their dpi to I think
it's like I don't know try like 8,000
we'll try doing eight thousand or
something astronomical and they'll have
to beam like that until they solve a
relatively simple puzzle a jigsaw puzzle
and then the next one we have is on
hunchback and basically originally we
were actually going to have you
handcuffed your left wrist to your right
ankle but we cannot find our handcuffs I
don't know if someone stole our hand we
should have handcuffed the handcuffs to
something
why would we need them at home well way
to be on the nose
that leaves zero room for imagination
thank you I feel us quite the sauce
everyone she's here all night just
kidding dad if you're watching this boy
anyway so we will be using a shoelace
instead to replace the handcuffs at work
you could have just said that and
finally we have bug eyes where you'll
have to wear a pair of kaleidoscope
goggles which obviously impedes your
vision in a very pretty way yes but
those are our cards ladies and gentlemen
so with that said I'm gonna shuffle them
up okay and deal them out at random
what's your ideal what that's that's
only fair what yeah that's how it's
really done
all right fine oh here we go I get bug
eyes
why if he gets flashbang yeah yeah I get
devil's candy I hate this game cuz you
get all crazy like no I don't boil slick
that one's terrible that one sounds
awful
Andy get Hunchback good I have a bad
knee right now spiritual that's true
alright those are our cards ladies and
gentlemen let us take our seats plate
first oh no wait
shit I just feel like you've all hunched
back which means I'm the one that hasn't
so my bad oh yay yay oh now it's a
problem oh that's not part of the game
all right all systems go Matt starts
yeah we're going there's no boss right
no BOTS it's just you and me baby
alright Matt starts in 3 2 1 go
I know why I'm doing this
oh my god
thank God that might be the first time
you you've gotten the first kill but I
get the second one baby
Oh God you think you have what it takes
damn you
oh the attacks haven't even started
rolling out yet you ain't screwed yet
moo block okay all right I'm honestly
not too intimidated by this one because
even though I have to go backwards the
entire time I can still move my mouse to
sort of strafe left no this isn't that
bad I can handle oh I got a quarter I'm
stuck it's pretty much what's going
through my mind right now this isn't
good
this isn't good we use this hot sauce
all the time on our Foods office so I
think this will be a stick now I got to
find you backwards
terrible I'm so focused on moving that
I'm not even like looking for you
it's so distracting how those wings did
you just eat all three at once Wow
hardcore oh oh my god hey oh look over
there in the back of my throat but
you're still kicking my ass stuck on my
teeth burning but that was real bad
heartburn oh I think I think it might be
kicking in to kick someone someone give
me a bit over here
did she just drool yeah I bet that also
you know lubricates piers your mouth
keyboard which which doesn't do so great
for your aim I'm glad I'm far away from
you right now
take that drooler oh yes
oh no I cannot wait to walk forwards
again yes
alright thanks oh my god
mouth did I mention the peripherals I'm
using guys are Bubba fine all right
this isn't gonna be fun let's do this
shit does this make me look fat okay all
right
no I do what everybody watch after wipe
my nose okay okay just Williams will you
