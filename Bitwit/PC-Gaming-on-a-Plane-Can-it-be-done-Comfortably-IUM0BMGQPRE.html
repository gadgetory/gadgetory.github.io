plane to Virginia to attend my
sister-in-law's wedding and I had
brought along my msi gs70 inflate doom
to pass the time well much to my dismay
the experience was so unpleasant that
for the first time in my life I saw the
world through the eyes of a console
gamer so it got me thinking is it even
possible to game comfortably on a plane
in the first place assuming of course
that you're a pleb like me with standard
economy CD immediately I was determined
to see how much fun one could have
gaming 30,000 feet in the air so in
addition to covering Computex in asia
which is where i am now i began a side
quest to try and create the best
airborne pc gaming experience possible
during my 13 hour flight from LA to
taiwan of course before we can tackle
the issue we must first look back at
what went so horribly wrong and rude to
Virginia to make a long story short it
was mostly the laptops fault
to its credit the GS 60 makes for a
great gaming and editing station but
it's 15.6 inch form factor is simply too
big and heavy for the dinky fold-out
tables you find in coach seating the end
result is either major table sag or
having the laptop Teeter on the edge of
the table like a seesaw when your hands
apply too much force since there's also
no room for a mouse on the table I put
the mouse and mouse pad on one side of
the keyboard which actually worked out
pretty well if not for its size the GS
60 would still be a poor choice for
sky-high gaming in my book
due to its shockingly weak battery life
the laptop only managed to get around 1
hour and 20 minutes of continuous game
time after cutting the court and that
was that low to medium screen brightness
while many airplanes have AC power for
their passengers these days there's
still a fair number of smaller aircraft
that don't and even the ones that do
don't guarantee that their ports will
work the AC outlet for my seat to
Virginia was completely dead from the
moment I boarded so in the end my play
time was severely limited by the
depressing lifespan of my laptop's
battery clearly it was going to take a
smaller more power efficient and equally
fast device to solve all the issues
found with my GS 60 so I procured a
razor blade for my second attempt at
airborne gaming now while a 15.6 inch
screen is too large for plane use no one
wants to game on a tiny screen either so
I found the blades 14 inch screen to
strike a nice balance between screen
real estate and portability with a
resolution of 3200 by 1800 the IGZO
capacitive touch display is crystal
clear and pumps
outstanding color accuracy in contrast
I'm definitely not a fan of the screens
reflective tempered glass but
fortunately the cabin lights were turned
off for most of my flight so I wasn't
bombarded with heinous amounts of glare
since most of my play time was spent in
the dark the chroma RGB backlit keys
were a welcome addition with a handful
of lighting effects to boot
I found key travel to be a tad on the
shallow side but the keys are well sized
and spaced apart to allow for fluid
gaming as with the GS 60 I had to use my
mouse directly on the laptop despite its
smaller profile in this cramped
configuration the blades narrower 10
keyless design brings your hands closer
together pointing inward which while
tolerable isn't quite as comfortable as
having your arms straight out in front
of you another thing to consider here is
how sharp the laptops industrial design
is quite literally after a few hours of
gaming I noticed some slight irritation
from my wrists constantly rubbing
against the super straight edge of the
blades housing to avoid any discomfort
on your next flight
I would suggest grabbing some
repositional wrist rests for your laptop
I was happy to find working AC ports on
the way to Taiwan but the blades battery
life certainly offers peace of mind in
situations where you're not so lucky at
medium screen brightness the laptop
managed around five hours of straight
doom gameplay a much greater lifespan
than the GS 60 which is pretty
impressive considering they're both
using the same CPU 16 gigs of ram and
gtx 970m given the identical specs i
benchmarked both laptops to see just how
closely their performance lined up in
fire strike extreme the blade pushed out
a score of 3363 compared to the GS 60
slightly higher 3383 testing doom on
high settings at 1080p for more or less
the same with no noticeable difference
in gameplay experience between the two
however while the GS 60 gets pretty
toasty under load the razor blade does
turn into a slab of molten lava after an
hour or so of gaming had I known this
going into my flight I would have packed
a portable laptop cooler to keep the
heat under wraps now apart from the
laptop equally important to my air bound
gaming experience was my choice of
peripherals in the past I've talked
extensively about the Logitech g600 2 so
I won't dive too deep into what makes it
so awesome but the key point here is to
use a wireless mouse that prevents cable
clutter and interference in an already
claustrophobic gaming space just make
sure you pack extra batteries or a
charging cable and your carry-on also if
your pride will allow it the wireless
floating nature of gay
pads are well-suited for playing use
assuming you're not running a game that
relies heavily on keyboard and mouse my
choice of headphones were the sound
Pete's qy7
which is probably underwhelming to some
of you hardcore gamers out there but
these Bluetooth earbuds were incredibly
convenient given the circumstances not
only were they much lighter and more
portable than a set of cans but not
being tethered to the laptop allowed for
free movement about the cabin and made
getting up out of my seat a whole lot
easier one thing that could have made
the solution even more enjoyable would
have been some noise cancelling action
to tune out the planes roaring jet
engine and the shrill cries of an infant
in distress on a final note there are
some things to consider that come with
the territory of gaming on a plane
regardless of the hardware you choose
for starters expect the steely armrests
of your seats to take a toll on your
elbows after a few straight hours of
gaming a working remedy I found was to
use some spare shirts in your luggage or
request a blanket from the airline for
use as a cushion depending on the
rigidity of your fold-out table you also
might experience some unpleasant table
sag from the weight of your arms resting
on your laptop again shirts blankets and
even pillows can be wedged between your
legs on the table to prop it up and
improve its overall stability after all
was said and done having the right
hardware and applying the few pro tips I
learned allow me to gain comfortably on
the plane for two to three hours at a
time while flying coach which i think is
pretty good in my book considering
that's about how long I game at home
before needing a short break moving
forward with what I know now it's not
unreasonable to think that investing in
some wrist pads and finding a practical
way to keep the laptop cool could extend
my playtime even further certainly a
number of sacrifices need to be made
when gaming in a seat that rivals the
comfort of an electric chair but with
the proper devices in preparation it
seems you can still find ways to enjoy
PC gaming from a sardine can in the sky
but what do you guys think let me know
in the comments if you've ever made an
attempt at in-flight gaming and what the
experience was like for you also before
you go don't forget to toss me a like on

coming really soon and I will see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
