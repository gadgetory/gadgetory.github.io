I'm one of the many proud owners of the
Corsair 600 T and for the last three
years it served me quite well except for
the time the fam controller blew out
today I have with me the 600 T's Noble
successor on the graphite series the 780
T now this case has been out for a
couple months now so I'm kind of late to
the party on this video but as they say
better late than never that phrase
doesn't apply to everything though does
it
like never beating your kids it's almost
always better than beating them later in
today's review I give my two cents on
this case and ultimately decide if it's
worth the tedious upgrade from the 600 T
so let's get down to it
cosmetically speaking my first
impression of the 780 T was its bulky
size as it is a full tower chassis the
600 T itself was oversized for being a
mid tower case but still looks like an
anorexic dwarf in comparison the frame
of the case is still made of plastic but
takes on a more aggressive design with
its many angular curves if the 600 T
looked like a stormtrooper the 780 T's
definitely more Darth Vader at the front
are two five two quarter inch bays and a
removable dust filter that reveals two
140 millimeter white LED fans and
mounting points for three 120 s or 1 200
millimeter fan there's also an option
inside for front-facing radiator support
your front panel connectors include mic
and headphone two USB 2 and two USB 3 s
there's a reset and power button which
resembles the ignition button of a sexy
sports car except when it comes to
attracting women it won't there's also a
SATA powered 5 channel fan controller
that if it dies on me again I swear I'm
going to kill it now I can't kill it
it's already dead another removable dust
filter on top gives you access to
mounting points for a 280 or three sixty
millimeter radiator which can be mounted
externally for additional radiator
clearance inside the case for push-pull
configurations the cable routing options
here are limiting however as only one
routing hole lies at the front of the
case this isn't a big issue if you're
connecting all the top fans to the fan
controller but if you want to plug them
directly into your motherboard headers
there's not enough cable length for them
to route behind the motherboard tray
forcing you to route all the cables in
between the fans and down into the case
which won't exactly leave the cleanest
look without some extra effort guess I'm
not a fan of the hole I found in this
design header luck next time
fortunately the side panels have been
to improved with a single latch for
quick removal and who can ignore that
enormous side panel window that makes
Kitty captivity much more enjoyable for
the person outside
just wait till I turn the fans on on the
back are a couple holes for water
cooling tubes and a 140 millimeter non
led fan with adjustable height for
additional radiator clearance
you also get nine expansion slots for
maximum 4-way GPU support or a 3-way
setup with ample breathing room between
cards or a tablet or a switch blade on
the bottom are too long feet that
elevate the case so your lower
components have access to fresh air
underneath you also have removable front
and rear dust filters for your power
supply and optional bottom mounted
radiator before we move forward here's a
quick look at the mounting accessories
and user's manual popping off the right
side panel gives you a look at the
business end of the case where you get a
large CPU cooler cut out for your
motherboard tray a good number of
tie-down points for cables and just butt
loads of room for cable management not
only do you get over an inch of space
between the motherboard tray and the
side panel but there's a trough of sorts
down below that measures two and a half
inches deep which you can cram all kinds
of things in like a tablet or a
switchblade Coursera's also added three
to lets SSD mounts which show off your
drives on the other side of the case
when your drive cages are removed the
main interior is incredibly spacious as
well although you can expect any
hardware you put in here to look twenty
percent smaller due to the sheer amount
of space for all that radiator support
the all-black interior has large rubber
grommets on the motherboard tray except
for the cutout near the power supply
which throws off the otherwise clean and
uniform appearance seeing as how this
lower cutout is clearly visible through
the side panel window this is the world
we live in folks pre-installed standoffs
include a longer middle standoff to help
align the motherboard during
installation which is always a welcome
addition the case supports video cards
up to 14 inches in length before
interfering with the two modular drive
cages that hold up to six three and a
half or two and a half inch drives you
do have to remove a few screws before
you can rearrange the drive cages which
leads me to ask why you no thumb screw
Corsair the cages can also be offset a
few inches to fit a radiator at the
front or be removed completely to
accommodate a 240 radiator on bottom and
this is the biggest thing that sets the
780 T apart from the 600 T is its
uncompromised support for custom water
cooling I mean apart from the abundance
of radiator options there's almost more
to talk about on the outs
of the case then under the hood when
comparing to the 600 T if you're using a
closed-loop cooler or just sticking with
air you'll still benefit from the
excellent airflow with the three 140
millimeter fans but at the cost of
taking up a ton of space on your desk I
did do a system build in this case a few
weeks back for Newegg and it was one of
the easiest and fastest builds I've ever
done due to having so much room to work
with despite a few drawbacks I do like
this case overall however at just under
200 bucks I would only upgrade from a
600 T if I was planning a custom
water-cooled loop let me know what you
guys think of this case in the comments
below and I'm also curious to know what
is your favorite computer case of all
time and what about it makes it the best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
