info click the link in the description
below today my sauce and I are actually
headed to a Best Buy Mobile store so
that I can get a new phone because my
existing pixel one has been having
serious issues ever since I tragically
spilled tons of beer on it during the
awesome hardware livestream that many of
you guys are already familiar with Oh oh
my god so yeah well my I made it out
alive
my phone was the real victim of that
terrible terrible moment and ever since
it hasn't really been the same it's for
one no longer working with Wi-Fi Wi-Fi
will just connect for a brief moment and
then immediately drop no matter what
network I'm connecting it to
additionally and I'd say this is the
biggest problem that's convincing me to
get a new phone today is that it
automatically just shuts down and
reboots every 10 or 15 minutes so I'll
just be in the middle of tweet then
it'll just shut off and it'll lose
everything I've been dealing with this
problem for way too long and I'm finally
biting the bullet I don't want to spend
$800 on a new phone but I really don't
see any other option at this point so I
think the phone that I'm gonna replace
this one with is the pixel to non XL I
was considering the XL but I decided
against it for a number of reasons first
of which being I don't really need or
want a phone bigger than this one I find
the 5-inch screen this is the perfect
size for my I don't know an average size
hands and I just feel like it's more
ergonomic for me personally the other
reason I'm not opting for the pixel 2 XL
is because it's been known to have all
the display issues that you guys have
probably heard about the blue screen or
the other mutant at certain viewing
angles additionally the burnin and of
course google has released some patch
updates to rectify those issues but I'm
not exactly buying it a hundred percent
that those patches that software patches
can fix some serious hardware issues
with the phone it might help mitigate it
but I just don't feel 100% guaranteed
that I will have zero display issues
with a pixel to excel at this point so
for those reasons I'm going with a pixel
1 or a pixel 2 non XL hopefully they
have it in stock and that's my mobile
they literally just opened two minutes
ago you open at M o'clock let's give
them a call see what the gap hey do you
guys have the pixel to non XL in stock
right now do you think there's a higher
chance that like a full size Best Buy
might have it
the larger both lens around your
Hellerman either oh wow
okay all right well thanks a lot well
 on the bright side why he saw
speaks on the bright side we can get
coffee I was that was so disappointing
thought you're gonna have a way cooler
thing to say okay so a quick update the
exact phone I wanted was the pixel tune
on Excel 64 gig version which was
unavailable at any Best Buy within a 250
mile radius of where we're at but I
happen to find a 128 gigabyte model at
the Best Buy
in City of Industry which is only about
eight miles away so it says they only
have a few left by now to preserve I'm
gonna go ahead fly it online and pick it
up in the store we should be there in
about half an hour pending traffic so I
think it's gonna happen whoa are you
serious did you really just do that yeah
padded seats it's totally fine it's
broken anyway
so we just left that body we got the
phone and everything's gravy I say we
shoot the rest of this vlog using the
camera on the pixel - I think that's fun
what should we shoot first I'm eating
I'm starving oh good idea
let's shoot some food all right so we
are at BJ's now in City of Industry
right next to the Best Buy whoa TVs are
freaking out anyway
wifey sauce this is her her salad she's
currently not eating dairy and was
unaware that this salad came with cheese
so she's currently picking it off this
is what rejected cheese looks like on
the new pixel - even though it's pretty
low light in here the the camera is
still able to pick up a lot of detail
this is what a wedge salad looks like on
the pixel - I'm gonna go ahead and eat
it now you know as good as the video
looks honey the still photos of this
phone takes look even better so I'm
probably snap some some still life here
and go in the blog
doo-doo-doo ooh nice feet was that speed
zone let's go here
don't fall for those of you don't know
wifey sauce is like the clumsiest person
I've ever met in my life
oh you can dodge a wrench you can dodge
a ball
losers first I mean ladies first
I honestly I don't know if we this might
be a little bit complicated for you I
don't know if you'll be able to handle
this but give it a shot let's see if we
can do a par 5 for this one par 5
oh god it's gonna hurt alright jerk your
turn
