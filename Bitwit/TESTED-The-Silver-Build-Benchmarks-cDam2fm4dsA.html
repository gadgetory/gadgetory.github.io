LED strips from now until October
thirty-first cable mod is offering 20%
off all their products on performance
PCs dot-com click the link in the
description below and I will show you
the way
what's up gas so first off I wanted to
quickly say thank you for all the
feedback you've shared so far on the
first silver build video it seems like a
lot of you guys really liked how the rig
turned out with its shimmery veneer and
stuff so I've actually deemed it worthy
of giving it a proper name allow me to
reintroduce you to elixir a unique
concoction of precious metals sought by
DIY alchemists in a time long ago okay
maybe I'm going a little too far with
this whole PC identity thing and as nice
as elixir is to gawk at it's time to put
a working load on her to see how it
performs under pressure so cutting right
to the chase here my testing methodology
for measuring temperatures and acoustics
was pretty straight forward for
overclocking I took the 6600 k2 4.5
gigahertz at 1.3 volts and since our gtx
1070 for the win already came with a
hefty factory OC i was only able to
increase the core clock offset by 60
megahertz with 250 megahertz on the
memory clock after running Unigine
heaven' 4.0 for about 35 minutes with an
ambient temp of 26 degrees celsius our
GPU core clock averaged out at a steady
2 gigahertz while our memory clock
reached 20 163 megahertz temperatures
were a little high here hovering around
77 degrees Celsius most of the time with
a max of 79 if you remember last week's
video the same graphics card was
reaching identical temperatures in the
fractal design to find s which leads me
to believe this model just tends to run
a bit warm though it does stay a few
degrees cooler than the founders Edition
now one of the concerns some of you guys
had with this build was that the not to
a redo fans that I used for the radiator
on the CPU a IO were optimized for
airflow over static pressure causing a
lot of suspicion that they would do a
terrible job of cooling our processor
the verdict 73 degrees Celsius on the
hottest core in package with the average
temperature range between the 40s and
60s that's actually not too bad
considering our 4.5 gigahertz overclock
and I don't
those temps are anywhere close to posing
a threat to our CPU how much cooler the
chip would stay of switching to proper
radiator fans is the topic for another
video which may come around sooner than
you think at the very least even if
these aren't the best possible fans for
the task at hand the redo line is
advertised to be whisper quiet while
meeting not to his industry-leading
standards and all that good stuff so
with the system firing on all cylinders
let us begin our obligatory sound test
all right well Idol acoustics were
virtually non-existent you can
practically hear a pin drop at those
noise levels load acoustics on the other
hand are audible if you're really trying
to listen for it but these fans have
such a gentle sound profile that they
quickly get forgotten in the background
making for an extremely quiet gaming
experience it seems the folks over at
Noctua have done it again and impressed
the hell out of us GG guys GG finally to
test frame rates
I put the system through its paces by
firing up a number of intensive games on
Windows 10 with the latest 370 3.06 and
video drivers and ran all titles at 1920
by 1080 and 2560 by 1440 with our
handsomely SPECT hardware running
overclocked let's dive in today's epic
moshpit of benchmarks
so as you might have guessed the gtx
1070 and 6600 k combo absolutely tore
through our 1080p runs yielding averages
of over 100 FPS in 5 of the 7 games
tested elixir was no slouch when it came
to 2560 by 1440 either six out of seven
games scored over 70 FPS on average and
that's on ultra settings across the
board unless otherwise specified on the
benchmarks slides while our GPU temps
could stand to be a bit improved overall
today's testing points to a very capable
machine that delivers high-end quad HD
gaming while demanding little of your
ears
if certainly not your eyes that's gonna
do it for now guys let me know what you
think of these benchmarks in the
comments below and don't forget to ask
me like on this video if you enjoyed it
before you guys go feel free to check my
store and pick up a limited edition CPU
cooler hoody to keep you warmer than an
AMD chip for the holidays as always
thank you guys for watching subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already and I
will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
