come as a shock to most of you but I
spend a lot of time sitting in a chair
and that mean ate a lot of time my own
mother once mistook me for Stephen
Hawking hell if both my legs became
paralyzed today I probably wouldn't even
notice until next year CES
so with all this time I spend sitting
usually at my desk you would think that
I've got some fancy organ amah koffice
chair with all the bells and whistles
but the reality is for the last five
years I've been using this
needless to say I'd be more comfortable
in a wheelchair covered in poison ivy
and less embarrassed to be caught
sitting in one for that matter over the
years this economical office chair has
seen hard times the leather has become
stretched cracked and shredded to bits
by my two insidious cats and the padding
has become so flat it competes with a
girl's junior varsity volleyball team
well if you watched any of my recent CES
coverage you probably noticed that one
of my sponsors was need for seat a
company that makes quality chairs for
eSports and office use so when they
offered to send me their max anomic
classic office model for review I jumped
for joy as high as my miss shapen spine
would allow now more importantly was
also made explicitly clear that under no
circumstance would need precede
sponsorship guarantee them a positive
review so just remember that I'll be
sharing my genuine opinions of this
chair before you start a sandstorm in
the comments like the rude on that notes
what exactly can you hope to expect when
purchasing one of these high-end chairs
while the box that comes in is friggin
enormous with a hefty weight to boot so
it's probably best to find someone to
help you relocate it to a room with lots
of floor space for building now this
being an office chair and not a hard
drive it's not exactly fragile but all
the pieces still come well packaged with
foam and bubble wrap keeping them safe
and shipping assembly took me about 35
minutes and was fairly straightforward
with the super clear step-by-step
instructions read them carefully though
especially the part about not lifting
the backrest bar when fixing the
backrest to the seat
I missed that warning entirely without
anticipating the force of the spring as
it whipped the backrest brackets forward
and took the bolt I left dangling in one
of the mounting holes with its resulting
in a catastrophic first blood
perhaps that's why the manual advises
against making this a one-man job
if that one man is an idiot truth be
told it is nice to have someone to line
the heavy pieces in place when bolting
things down so definitely grab a
building buddy one quark during my build
is that several the small washers were
bent out of shape creating additional
thickness and keeping the bolts from
reaching the threads of the backrest
fortunately I was able to make contact
by tossing them out all together and
sticking with the large washers but
enough tack about the assembly already
how does this thing actually feel what
makes it special and why the hell is it
almost 500 dollars yeah these things
don't come cheap which is certainly a
high barrier to entry for the common
pleb like you or I but this price point
actually falls right in line with
competing gaming chairs of similar
quality and feature set first of which
is the premium look and feel that this
chair just radiates rarely ever does the
office chair steal the show from your
gaming desk or office but this thing
looks really pretty even when it's not
directly beside my old chair the classic
office model sports a neutral two-tone
black and gray color scheme lined with
polyurethane leather and a high quality
stitching job that looks simply awesome
while it's definitely sporty and
stylized there's also a touch of class
and elegance that keeps it from looking
too juvenile and really ups the curb
appeal of your overall desk area another
perk you get here that's often
overlooked when it comes to office
chairs is durability now of course only
time will tell how the leather holds up
against the constant friction of my back
and ass cheeks but at its core the chair
uses a tubular metal frame for support
and rigidity
whereas cheaper gaming seats often use
thin pieces of plywood to shape down
costs the casters and aluminum base are
also incredibly sturdy and can probably
be used to kill someone if thrown like a
frisbee but perhaps the most important
feature here in my opinion for what it's
worth is comfort ability and thank God
need procede has delivered in this arena
or else I'd be stuck with two chairs
that have less support than Donald Trump
first and foremost is the molded cold
foam on the seat and backrest which has
the proper amount of firmness for my
taste the foam is also plenty thick so
my back and epic glutes never have to
feel the internal metal frame now if
you're expecting the chair to feel like
a tempur-pedic mattress or a lazy boy
you'll be severely disappointed but a
quality gaming chair isn't designed
around getting a good night's sleep or
the optimal position to eat popcorn in
what the seat prioritizes is support
over long periods of desk use and by
managing to pull that off the chair is
subsequently made comfortable the foam
is only half the story though the curved
sides on the backrest
- a fantastic job of keeping you
centered and offer additional support
when leaning to the side I was also
surprised to see how much taller the
backrest is than on my old chair
as long as I've owned that thing my head
has really never had a place to go so
the extra length of the mechs nomic and
the included headrest pillow is a very
welcome addition on the right side of
the backrest is a knob for adjusting the
chairs built-in lumbar support while the
knob is sturdy and turns with ease I do
wish it was a bit less awkward to reach
when sitting down in its defense this
feature single-handedly earned the wife
seal of approval
despite the chairs aesthetic not
matching the drapes in our FOIA this
along with built-in back pressure
adjustment do an excellent job of
keeping your spine aligned and back
comfortable as I mentioned earlier the
chair has a lever to adjust the incline
of the backrest ranging from fetal
position - someone should really be
behind me right now apart from the
Hunchback of Notre Dom I can't see
anyone complaining about the range
limitations here and I know I said these
things weren't meant for sleeping but
this chair makes the prospect of an
impromptu power nap all too real apart
from the backrest the entire seat can
lean back freely for days or be locked
into place with the left side lever
underneath the seat the lever on the
right handles the chairs overall height
adjustment and while NBA players should
feel right at home even at the lowest
height position my feet dangle in midair
which make me look like a hairy child on
a swing I'm not sure if all the maximum
exceeds are like this but this is
definitely one of the few oversights
with the classic office model now so far
it's clear that our backs and our butts
are well taken care of but the chair
also offers a pair of flexible armrests
that can be adjusted in virtually any
position of your preference distance
between the armrests can be changed
using either the mounting strips beneath
the seats which do require you to loosen
the bolts or by holding down a button
and sliding the arm pad itself
additional easy to reach buttons allow
you to slide the armrests forward or
backward pivot them inward or outward
and adjust the height for a wide range
of flexibility the pads are made of a
firm but soft padding with a slight
curvature to match the shape of your arm
and the metal armrest posts are built
like tanks the rigidity of these however
are somewhat overshadowed by the wobbly
plastic pieces of the upper arm rests
while I doubt they're at risk of
breaking anytime soon the loose fit and
plastic buttons certainly make the
armrests feel like the weakest link of
this product when compared to the rest
of its quality parts that said they are
comfortable and the adjustability to
suit my gaming work or
NEADS is pretty damn sweet overall this
is by far and away the best office chair
I've ever owned or even sat in for that
matter I mean when it comes to support
comfort flexibility and durability the
max comic really delivers on all these
fronts while giving your setup a
facelift that says I ain't no filthy
casual granted it's also the most
expensive chair I've ever touched with
my own two hands or my butt but much
like the high-end headphone market
game-changing innovations in office
chairs are few and far between so if you
can make that initial investment I'm
pretty sure that you'll enjoy sitting on
your ass in front of your computer more
than you ever have before for years to
come but let me know what you guys think
of this thing in the comments and don't
