what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well today
I'm taking a look at yet another brand
new case this time it's from the folks
over at BitFenix this is their BitFenix
and so you guys might remember this case
I actually checked it out at Computex
earlier this year it was proposed as an
$80.00 case it is now $89
RP that's the official statement and
it's a it's it's quite packing a lot of
aesthetic features for a sub $100
chassis for example you can see we've
got RAF the Betts nice addressable RGB
on that front panel additionally we've
got an RGB fan that's included at the
back of the case 120 millimetres both of
these elements can be wired up to the
built-in RGB hub / controller that's
actually located behind the motherboard
trade from there you can pipe it into a
50/50 header on your motherboard if it's
supported and this may be good or bad
depending on if you have an asus or a
sync supported motherboard because
that's currently the only vendor that
BitFenix has worked with on this case so
unless you have an asus or a sync
supported motherboard you won't be able
to software control the RGB elements in
this chassis however don't fear if you
don't have one of those boards you can
still actually control all the lighting
from the built-in front panel button
here so it cycles through a couple
different colors I know we're just
starting right off with with RGB stuff
what a world we live in 2017 yeah get it
so there's a ton of different different
features and/or different effects I
should say for these elements and of
course you could even attach your own
LED strip if you wanted to get super
fancy with it and illuminate the inside
even further additionally you get
tempered glass you have a tempered glass
side panel here with four typical thumb
screws that we're used to seeing and and
this is these are both sort of premium
features a lot of people can't really
get a case with both addressable RGB and
a tempered glass side panel under a
hundred bucks and somehow BitFenix has
managed
do this the question is what kind of
shortcuts have they taken in order to
fit all of this in an $89 chassis so
that's kind of what we're gonna figure
out today if if this is still a well
balanced enough chassis for your
particular needs but starting off with
the front of the case as I mentioned
before there's of course RGB elements
you also might notice a dearth of
ventilation I was trying to look for
where are the front fans or the single
front included fan where is it actually
in taking air from there's zero
ventilation at the front at the top on
the sides meaning really you have one
small opening I guess it's a fairly
large opening at the bottom but still if
you have three fans you can actually
have three 120 millimeter fans here at
the front it seems like they're only
able to pull air from the very bottom of
the case which we're actually gonna do
some thermal testing later on in this
video so stay tuned for that we'll see
if it's actually being starved or choked
in any way I should also mention that at
the front you do get support for up to a
three hundred and sixty millimeter
radiator so a iosr welcome you can even
try your hand at some custom water
cooling in here it might be a little
tight I did see them pull it off at
Computex although it did look pretty
claustrophobic in there but 360s at the
front and you've also got a pretty nice
I Oh selection here at the front panel
mic and headphone jacks your power and
reset and that led changing button as
well as two USB 3.0 ports at the top you
get what looks to be another radiator
mount but unfortunately it's just mounts
for two 120 millimeter fans I don't
think you'd actually have enough
clearance for your motherboard vrm and
memory etc if you were to mount a
radiator there the case is just a little
too narrow for that
fortunately they do throw in this
handy-dandy magnetic dust filter which
is of course removable they've also
included a non mesh version of this if
you wanted to just cut it off for
ultimate silence or you know improved
acoustics or something like that however
you would be sacrificing a bit of
ventilation on the back of the case you
get like I said that 120 millimeter RGB
fan a cutout for your motherboard IO and
seven expansion slots as well as just a
regular power supply mount you would
basically mount the power supply from
behind them
or tray as opposed to from the actual
back of the case which is totally fine
by me
you also get a power supply dusk filter
that sort of pulls out from the side of
the case same side as the tempered glass
side panel which is kind of interesting
it comes out fairly easily and sliding
it back in is a little bit more tricky
it's easy to get snagged but you know
you got to wiggle it a little bit
there's probably takes a little bit of
practice should also mention that there
are two removable dust filters at the
front of the case for your 120
millimeter fans and those are sort of
the same deal they come out pretty
easily but they can be a little bit
janky going in I've kind of gotten used
to them but first few tries were a
little tricky but that seems to be
pretty cool and all in order the left
side panel is pretty basic it's just got
these two thumb screws that are not
captive unfortunately but they seem to
do the job just fine on that note I
think we can probably take a look at the
inside of the case I'm gonna go ahead
and get this side panel off so we can
check out the internal layout so here we
are taking a look at the inside of the N
so now at that side panel removed first
thing I want to point out is for the
front mounted radiator you do have a
certain amount of clearance available to
you there is a cutout with this power
supply shroud first off Bravo for power
supply shroud in an $89 case so there's
a small cutout here at the front which
gives you I would say about three inches
of clearance for your radiator and and
in fans on one side of that radiator
unfortunately it does not look like
there's any room on the opposite side of
this mounting plate for a push-pull
configuration so you want to bear that
in mind especially with the limited
airflow that you're getting from the
bottom of the case putting more fans
cramming more fans underneath this front
panel would probably restrict your
airflow even further
additionally the fan here at the front
doesn't have a cable that's long enough
to reach behind the motherboard tray and
actually plug into one of the fan
headers on my motherboard which is why I
had to route it so nastily on this side
of the case it's quite an eyesore it
would have been no problem had I had a
fan header on this motherboard that was
somewhere on the right side it would
have been a little bit closer and it
would have been able to go behind
that motherboard tray but unfortunately
that wasn't the case now if you have a
premium other board with you know five
to eight fan headers on it then you
probably have a fan header somewhere on
here where the cable could reach
theoretically and and be hidden overall
but most people who are buying an $89
case are going to be buying something
like this you know whatever this is
prime be 350 plus motherboard that only
has a few headers on it so it's kind of
a shame that this cable coming from this
fan is so short but the one on the back
is just fine of course additionally
we've got rubber grommets two of them
right here right by the ATX 24 pin and
one at the bottom near the power supply
shroud they actually look really nice
and they feel nice and stuff but they're
also kind of loose so when you're
passing larger cables through them it's
really easy for them to come out or to
be shaken loose and you kind of have to
fit them back in which is a bit of an
annoyance additionally there's a large
cutout for cables right here towards the
front of the case it's very large I
would have liked to see that with a
grommet as well but what can you do and
there's also a really small cable cutout
at the top left corner of the case that
you can hardly see actually it's kind of
tricky to pass cables through there and
it's really small I was able to fit my 8
pin EPS connector through there just
fine though and then we've also got two
smaller cutouts at the bottom of the
case right on the power supply shroud
where you can pass your smaller cables
like your USB 3 and your front panel
connectors additionally I do appreciate
just how long of a graphics card you can
fit in here pretty much any GPU will do
just fine
I wouldn't recommend a crossfire or SLI
set up in here simply because the power
supply shroud has zero ventilation and
if you were to slot it in a second card
you might be a bit starved for airflow
unless you maybe mounted another fan at
the bottom here to sort of help with
heat dissipation and things like that
also I do appreciate the pre-installed
standoffs just to make the build process
go that much quicker but on that note
let's go ahead and flip this guy around
and see what's on the other side
all right so taking a look at our
business end of the BitFenix and so
first off I noticed a large CPU cooler
cut out which is always handy to have
we've also got plenty of tie down points
no shortage of that so cable management
in this case despite what you see here
in the brief three minutes that I took
to just quickly slam the side panel on
cable management in this case is
actually pretty good for an $89 case I
mean obviously you get a power supply
shroud so you can stash all of your
excess cables under there and again with
all the tie-down points and stuff as
well as about just under an inch of gap
between the the motherboard tray and the
side panel it's actually quite easy to
wire things up even if you had
extensions or something like that should
be no problem over here you actually get
a little plate a removable plate for an
SSD or any two and a half inch drive
really little thumb screw which I do not
believe is captive
nope just comes off like that you simply
mount the SSD to the tray and then you
mount it back on to the motherboard tray
and it's a pretty tried-and-true
solution no complaints there you also
have two two and a half inch mounts
right here these are these are more just
like holes that are cut in to the actual
motherboard tray and the issue that I
have with this is that if you put them
if you if you mount the drive with the
connectors facing the front of the case
there's absolutely no room to plug in
any of the cables however if you flip it
around then all the SATA cables say the
data and power cables are pretty much
encroaching on either of these rubber
grommets which doesn't seem like a great
design choice
so my two cents personally additionally
we've got plenty of room for a power
supply I believe this one is the 650
watt g2 from EVGA I think it's a hundred
and sixty-five millimeters but I
wouldn't recommend anything longer than
that because then you start to run into
clearance issues with the drive cage
which does have two plastic trays I
think you can fit a three and a half
inch or two and a half inch drive on
either of those they're fairly cheap I
mean you got a cut corner somewhere and
these are made of full plastic they look
like they could probably break easily if
mishandled but we haven't run into any
issues so far and then additionally
you've just got some more empty space
here at the front again if you wanted to
mount another fan at the bottom or if
you had an extended radiator over here
right smack in the middle of our
motherboard
tre kind of hard to see with all these
cables in the way is our RGB hub it's
already wired up to connect all the RGB
elements in our case it's a small and
discreet doesn't take up much room
and it's SATA powered thank God thank
God for an $89 case we're not seeing
molex anymore definitely staying with
the times here happy to see that but
that's pretty much the back of the case
now let's talk about acoustics and
thermals so as I mentioned to you guys
earlier I was a bit concerned about the
ventilation and the sort of airflow at
the front of this case in particular
because the only opening we have is at
the bottom and it seems to be really far
away from the only fan that we have here
at the front so I kind of copied what
gamers Nexus did with the H 500 P from
coolermaster where they actually did
some a B comparison testing for thermals
with and without the front side panel so
first off we've got some specs here that
I need to read off you've got a risin 5
1500 X being cooled by a wraith spire
stealth and that is not overclocked
completely stock and we've got an R X
480 that's an asus strix model also
running stock everything here is
air-cooled of course and then I fired up
Unigine Heaven 4.0 for about 15 minutes
with and without the the front panel
installed and what we found was on our
CPU we actually dropped about 4 degrees
Celsius going from 68 to 64 C which
isn't a huge drop we saw a bigger Delta
with our GPU going from 76 to 69 degrees
Celsius so a 7 degree difference there
which is quite a bit it's noticeable
especially if you're you know looking at
something like GPU boost a 7 degree
difference is potentially going to keep
your GPU from maybe overclocking itself
another 10 20 megahertz for example and
that can potentially lead to a couple
frames loss during your gameplay however
the results here were not nearly as bad
as I anticipated so that's actually a
great sign however that also goes to
show that if you were planning to put a
high high wattage consumption CPU in
here and you were intending to overclock
it aggressively it might not be the
wisest idea inside of this particular
chassis unless maybe you're slapping on
a heavy AO and you're doing some custom
fan tuning too
sure that everything's in proper thermal
order so some of things up here I
honestly had a pretty nice time building
inside of this case I didn't run into
any major snags if anything there were a
couple minor annoyances that I wish
could be changed but for 89 bucks
pleasantly surprised with the building
procedure in the end so here however
there were a couple areas of the case
that I feel could be improved in the
quality department some of the steel
feels really thin the drive trays are
really plasticky and cheesy just certain
things that you wouldn't ever find in a
case over $100 and the fact of the
matter is you can find $89 cases that
are higher quality than this one
hands-down build quality just
construction overall look and feel
however where this case gets it right is
that you're getting tempered glass on
your side panel as well as addressable
RGB lighting at the front of your case
and an RGB fan included these are
typically premium features that most
builders have to pay over $100 for to
even scratch the surface of and here it
is for well under that price point so
it's really gonna boil down to what kind
of builder you are are you interested in
things like RGB and tempered glass or
would you prefer a bit higher quality
and maybe a bit smoother of a building
experience guys let me know what your
comments are and opinions are of this
case down below and feel free to toss me
a like on the video if you enjoyed it
have a good one I'll see you all in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
