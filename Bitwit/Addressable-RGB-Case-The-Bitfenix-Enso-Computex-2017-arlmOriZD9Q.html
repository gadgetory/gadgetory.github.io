to you by be quiet cable mod verda gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info so we're at
the BitFenix booth now checking out
their Enzo full ATX chassis actually it
supports a ATX - it's a fairly slim case
I don't have a banana for scale like I
usually do but it's a very nice looking
case you can see there's a no shortage
of RGB LEDs on this guy actually the
ones on the front panel are completely
built-in there's a controller that you
can change up to you know a few
different colors several different
colors or you can do them the nice the
very nice rainbow effect I will say the
RGB implementation on the front here is
pretty pretty pretty on point you don't
see any visible hotspots it's very
seamless with the transitioning and
these are addressable LEDs which seems
to be the latest craze these days in the
case market so for example you've got
addressable RGB LED strips on the inside
of the case they've also got some some
fans in here these are their RGB fans
very familiar I think they're using the
same frames as they're very popular fans
in the past 120 140
however they now have been given RGB
life by the way the fans and the strips
are sold separately from this case the
only RGB element that you have in this
chassis that comes included is at the
front panel fortunately that looks
absolutely beautiful once again a bit
more about the case is that we've got 2
to 120 fan mounts at the top or the
removable dust filter it is magnetic
comes on and off very easily no radiator
support at the top however you do get
rad support for a 240 millimeter AIO or
radiator at the front which is nice to
see indeed you've also got just plenty
of room for cable management or actually
pretty decent cable management because
you've got a nice power supply Strout
here which looks very clean it's just
completely simple there's no SSD tray at
the front there's no opening window to
kind of let your power supply bleed in a
bit it's just completely a mast off
which I really like now let's actually
pop that right side panel off see what
they're packing on the business end
gowipe sauce go wiper sauce go wiper
sauce it's your birthday use of thumb
screws while she's getting the side
panel off I'm going to drink some beer
yes bit if you go to the BitFenix booth
economy Tex 2017 they will give you free
beer
brought to you by noble chairs
apparently thanks wifey I didn't
do what you did yeah you're good you're
sitting outside so here's a look at the
business end thank you very much yg for
taking that off and you get a very large
CPU cooler cutouts which is super nice
if you need to swap out your CPU cooler
you don't have to remove your entire
motherboard actually way more tie-down
points than I would have expected for a
case of this caliber I'm going to get to
the MSRP on this bad boy in just a bit
it will shock you I guarantee a nice
little power supply mount here of course
underneath the basement plenty of room
for cable management it looks like you
can fit a couple three and a half inch
drives in there as well one SSB behind
the motherboard directly and two more
behind where you would mount your front
radiator plenty of cable routing with
grommets which is always nice to see and
it looks like we've got a controller
here of some sorts this must be for the
RGB functionality very sweet the MSRP
for this bad boy is only $79 us which is
absolutely competitive and aggressive in
every way
it just looks absolutely fantastic that
I mentioned tempered glass slide panel I
completely overlooked that at first but
you really are getting an impressive
package for not too much money here
which you can actually probably get your
hands on some time in q3 or q4 of 2017
so be on the lookout for the Enzo it's
not called the Enzo showcase I asked
them about the housing is it really
called the Enzo showcase like now that
was a marketing error it's literally
just the Enzo so good job good job that
Phoenix marketing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
