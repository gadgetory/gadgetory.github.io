stylings three here I think you're gonna
love them
nice can't wait to check these out
thanks by the way my car broke down and
I was wondering if you don't know what's
happy hey be quiet in here Kyle wasn't
prepared to be blown away by the new
silent wings three fans from be quiet
are you for a cooler quieter system
click on the link in the description for
more info what's up gasp so I'm not sure
if you've noticed all of my travel vlogs
over the past few months but from
covering press events in London and Hong
Kong to conventions in Las Vegas and
Taiwan I've spent a good chunk of 2016
afk relying heavily on my smart phone to
record tweet translate and navigate my
way through it all to avoid unnecessary
panic my trips have always employed a
few battery packs that I've acquired
over the years while they've saved my
ass plenty of times their prolonged use
has led to things like wear and tear
finicky USB ports and cell degradation
prompting me for an overdue upgrade so
after hours of research I narrowed down
three highly rated battery banks on
Amazon that each cater to a specific use
case scenario that I think most of us
encounter at one point or another so I
thought it would be cool to share them
with you today as always if you'd like
more information you can check out the
product links in the description so
starting with the smallest capacity and
working our way up the first pack we
have is the vive int pb0 3-1 I would say
that this Bank makes the most sense if
it's just you and your phone for the day
especially if you're travelling light as
this is truly a pocket-sized enclosure
with about the same weight and
dimensions as a leading non XL
smartphone it kind of even looks like
one too with its rounded edges and
two-tone endings that could pass for
antenna lines in a heartbeat
now I've never considered aesthetics
when shopping for battery packs but the
vyvanse aluminium finish gives the
housing a premium look and feel that I
can't keep my hands and eyes off of
fortunately the coating is highly
resistant to smudges and fingerprints as
well
the only shortcoming here is that it
makes the device a little soapy and I
could imagine dropping this long before
my smartphone which is far more
ergonomic that being said I can't stress
enough how much I love this form factor
for a light battery bank sure you can
cram larger high-capacity bricks into
your pockets but the vibin does so
without creating a massive bulge in your
pants which is why I'm only showing one
right now despite its size it still
manages a capacity of five thousand
milliamps which is enough to fully
charge your phone and then some you
wouldn't expect it on such a small
device but you'll also find a pair of
2.4 amp USB type AAA outputs if you and
a friend want a juice up concurrently
one of these provides v smart technology
which detects and uses the best current
protocol to maximize the charging speed
of any device and will see this same
feature pop up under different patented
names with the other battery packs as
well in between the ports is a micro USB
input which supports two amp chargers to
fully recharge the pack in about four to
five hours pressing a small button on
the side lets you know how much power
the bank has left with a four increment
LED indicator that shines brightly even
in direct sunlight when charging the LED
flashes continuously at its current
battery life and turns solid to let you
know when it's reached 100% now for all
the battery packs today I conducted a
test to see how much they could charge
my Galaxy S six from 1% battery life in
just 30 minutes upon connecting the
vibin to my phone the charging started
automatically and got us to a
respectable 48 percent which would give
me at least a few hours of solid usage
overall I'm really satisfied with this
Bank so far as a day-to-day companion
for its ultra portability helpful LED
cues and fast charging all of which are
backed by a 2-year warranty with product
registration moving on to some heavy
artillery next on the list is the pvt 9
from a key or okey-okey
I don't care I actually took this Bank
with me to Hong Kong last month so
please forgive any signs of wear or
democratic struggle at over triple the
capacity of the vibrant the 16 thousand
milliamp brick is ideal for one to two
people or devices over the course of two
to three days short camping trips
conventions and perhaps waiting in Black
Friday lines seem like good applications
for this beefy powerhouse you'll want to
make sure you've got a bag or backpack
though as the length and weight make it
two impractical for pocketing IMO
shipped with a two-year warranty the
bank sports a full matte black finish
with a hard plastic construction that
feels like it could stop a bullet build
quality is top-notch and the pack
appears simplistically stealthy if not a
tad boring there's also no hope of any
fingerprints escaping here making this
device Oh J's worst nightmare another
concern is that the edges seemed
unnecessarily sharp while there's no
chance of slicing yourself open dropping
this on the wrong floor a table at the
right angle could do some serious damage
rounding corners next time might offer
some peace of mind for recharging the
unit you get a 2 amp micro USB input
which tops the battery off in five to
six hours you also get two USB type-a
outputs which highlight the bank's
charging features such as Qualcomm quick
charge 3.0 provided by the Orange port
as the name suggests this technology
allows for quicker charging exclusively
with QC 3.0 supported devices whereas
the green port on the unit is a standard
2.4 amp output with its own AI power
adaptive charging technology that we saw
on the vibrant pressing a button on the
back of the device activates the battery
life LED with white indicating 170
percent charge remaining green showing
70 to 30% and red with 30 to 0 now call
me a simpleton but having to remember
which colors mean what isn't quite as
intuitive as having a status bar and
given the large capacity I would have
liked to see more than just 3 battery
health increments when charging the LED
flashes in the color indicative of the
current battery level but one oversight
here is that once it reaches 100% the
white light continues to flash
ambiguously leaving you unsure if it's
ready to unplug at least there's a handy
built-in flashlight that can blind you
to these minor shortcomings using the
standard 2.4 import the t9 took my
galaxy s6 from 1 to 42% in our 30 minute
charge tests while this falls a bit
short of the vibrance performance the
main appeal of this brick is its quick
charge 3.0 feature which I'm sure would
have seen much better results if only I
had a supported device to test it with
personally the standard charge times I
experienced in Hong Kong with this
device were plenty fast for my needs and
lasted nearly three days before needing
a top off like most banks the pbt 9 does
have its quirks but for quick charge
users it's great for short trips and
takes a beating like a champ
to mention it can also be used to beat
someone else now the last bank I picked
up is an absolute monster so much in
fact that's what the company decided to
call it this is simply the monster from
easy easy acts doesn't matter this big
bastard comes in to 20,000 milliamps and
accommodates up to four devices at a
time for three to four days depending on
usage those who undertake weekend-long
conventions music festivals and extended
backpacking trips should have one of
these at their site the monster is just
a smidge bigger than the PBT 9 but
weighs considerably more at the 1 pound
mark likewise you'll want a bag to carry
this in while it charges your device's
the plastic enclosure is super tough and
built like a tank while stylized
chamfered edges and an orange stripe
around the brick give it a rugged manly
appearance that says I've charged phones
before like any manly device the monster
welcomes finger prints and smudges of
all kinds wearing them proudly like
battle scars from the french-fry war of
2016 with 4 USB type outputs delivering
a total of 4 point 8 amps with adaptive
charging technology there will also be
no shortage of friends coming up to
suckle at your electrical teat quick
shout out to the obligatory flashlights
we get it you're a multi-tool now a
special feature you won't find on most
bricks of this caliber is the inclusion
of 2 2 amp micro USB inputs which can be
used simultaneously to recharge the pack
50% faster than with a single cable
giving you a recharge time of just 5 to
6 hours not half bad for a 20,000
milliamp battery this can be a lifesaver
if you don't have much downtime before
your next adventure but need to recharge
quickly on the side of the unit is a
button that illuminates the battery life
status bar with for health increments
while the lights are tiny and don't have
the best viewing angle their brightness
makes them easily visible in any setting
they actually function identically to
the LEDs on the buy 'but flashing at the
current battery level when charging and
turning solid when complete simply it
effective but like the al key brick more
increments or even a digital display for
such a high capacity would have been a
really nice touch after a half hour
charged the monster filled by GS 6 to
42% battery life tying it with the AL
keep EBT nine well you can probably find
faster batteries out there especially
with helpful charging technologies it's
hard to beat the versatility and
recharging speed that comes with this
beastly bar of power
so there you guys have it this is the
new arsenal of batteries that I'll be
using hopefully for the next few years
assuming they hold up let me know which
one of these appeals the most to you and
what external battery pack you're
currently using when you're out and
about before you guys go don't forget to
toss me a look on this video if you
enjoyed it and while you're at it check
out the new stuff on my store two new
shirts and a hoodie have been added with
the official bit wit logo and they look
pretty elite so be sure to pick one of
those up and represent before I change
my channel name again
there wasn't couch bed but thank you
guys for watching subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already and that
will see all of your beautiful faces in
