channel the topic we're discussing today
caters mostly to the mainstream Windows
PC users so while it may be common
knowledge to some of you if not most of
you I feel like this video needs to be
made because there are so many people
out there who buy a snappy new desktop
or notebook and still wonder why it runs
like a potato
one year later so assuming your hardware
isn't the bottleneck assuming it's a
newish computer that leaves your
software as the main culprit behind
these sluggish woes viruses and other
malware may be the first offenders that
come to mind and they certainly can be
but to be honest most of the slow
computers I've encountered over the
years are plagued less by malicious code
than they are with bundled software
antivirus programs and other trusted
applications so let's talk about why
this happens how to fix it and how to
prevent it from happening in the future
so kicking things off it's no surprise
that the age-old problem of malware has
led to the mass appeal of antivirus
programs for decades however depending
on the software these protective
applications can actually bring your
system to a crawl just like the viruses
they attack by periodically scanning and
updating in the background antivirus
programs can significantly drain your
system resources causing slowdowns when
you're busy doing other tasks for
optimal performance it's generally a
good idea to schedule your scans late at
night or during a time when you won't be
using your PC if your software lacks a
scheduling feature you may consider
upgrading to a paid version that allows
it or finding a different program
altogether a seemingly audacious
alternative is to not have an AV program
at all I know it sounds like crazy talk
to have your system quote-unquote
unprotected but simple safe browsing
habits are the best defense against
contracting a virus red flags to avoid
include untrusted downloads links and
unknown emails and pop-up advertisements
keeping your distance from these is
relatively easy to do and that's what's
kept my own personal computer infection
free for nearly two years without the
aid of any security software so with an
AV program no longer slowing you down
you may still have additional software
running in the background impeding
performance typically when you boot up a
new computer for the very first time
only a few essential programs and
process
are running to keep your system
functioning properly as you install more
and more programs over time however some
of them continue running invisibly in
the background 24/7 even after
restarting your computer and eventually
you could have dozens of them running
simultaneously which will eat away at
your system memory and bog down the
overall snappiness of your PC
the first step to curbing this is to do
a little spring cleaning and uninstall
any unwanted programs that you can live
without if applicable this also includes
bloatware programs that come pre-loaded
on your computer by the manufacturer
that are more often than not heaping
piles of ram eating garbage since some
bloat ware is protected from
conventional uninstallation methods you
may or may not need to Google the
program in search for bloat where
removal guides for your specific model
of PC to remove most other applications
Windows 7 users can start by accessing
the control panel through the Start menu
or from searching for it in the search
box windows 8 and 10 users can hit the
windows and X keys together and select
control panel from the pop up menu from
the control panel window select
uninstall a program to open the list of
your installed applications now before
you get trigger-happy there are certain
programs you should not uninstall or
else your PC may not work properly
these include applications from
companies such as Microsoft Intel AMD
and NVIDIA you can click publisher at
the top of the publisher column to make
these vital programs easier to spot when
ready left-click the app you wish to
remove click uninstall and follow the
prompt until the application has been
removed successfully repeating this
process for all other unwanted programs
now that you've cleaned up your software
list there's still a fair chance that
some of your remaining programs have
elected themselves to start up
automatically whenever you turn on your
computer so next you'll have to disable
these startup programs manually in
Windows 7 click the start button and
type MS config.php in the search box and
hit enter once the system configuration
window opens select the startup tab and
uncheck all the boxes next to the
programs you wish to prevent starting up
with Windows do this for as many
applications as you see fit and think
logically do you really need Skype or
Spotify to start every time you boot
your computer probably not if you're on
the fence about disabling something you
don't recognize Google what it does and
decide for yourself click OK once you're
satisfied with your
selection and restart your system for
the changes to take effect or click exit
without restart if you're not ready to
reboot in Windows 8 and 10 the list of
startup applications is found in your
task manager which you can bring up by
hitting ctrl shift escape after clicking
the startup tab you can disable an app
from starting with Windows by
right-clicking it and selecting disable
once you've trimmed down your number of
startup programs close the task manager
window and your changes will take effect
the next time you restart your system so
by now your PC should feel a bit quicker
on its toes depending on how many
resources you just freed up but unless
you start changing the way you install
programs from here on out you will
inevitably fall back into the same slow
nightmare before you know it and not
having the information I'm about to
share with you in my opinion is the
number one cause of why Windows users
report slowdowns on their relatively new
PCs so here's the deal many of the
programs that we all download these days
are completely free to turn a profit the
developers of these programs often
bundle their software with third-party
programs that pay them for a chance to
be installed on your computer
rarely ever these bundled programs
needed to make your desired software run
properly and in fact they can even take
the form of spyware or adware collecting
and sending your private information to
an untrusted source these applications
sneakily hide in the Installer of the
parent program you actually want so if
you've ever noticed an application
running that you don't recall installing
or a strange new toolbar on your web
browser it's likely that in the flurry
of clicking through some installer in
the past you actually agreed to have
that put on your computer so the next
time you install a program refrain from
blindly clicking next agree or accept at
every turn and instead take your time to
check each page for any bundled software
these can be hard to spot and some
installers can contain multiple
intrusive programs when you're given the
option to climb the offer or uncheck the
box to keep it off your system and if
you're unsure if the app in question is
vital to making your program run
properly
google it a minute or two of research
can save you hours of frustration later
on and to be frank following the steps
and advice in this video is by no means
a magic bullet to making your system run
like it did on day one that's when a
clean install of Windows may be in order
but hopefully following this guide will
leave you with more so
resources at your disposal and a greater
awareness on how to prevent software
from hampering your user experience
moving forward so if you found this
