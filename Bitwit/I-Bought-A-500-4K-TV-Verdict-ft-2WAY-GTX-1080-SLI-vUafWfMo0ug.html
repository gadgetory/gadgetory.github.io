at least the time of filming this video
and wifey sauce and I are supposed to go
over to my parents place later this
evening for a barbeque and festivities
and that sort of thing it's gonna be
lots of fun so this year for Father's
Day I thought it would be fun to get
I'll pop something a little bit more
exciting than the typical necktie which
is this 4k television or TV from Hisense
now it's a 50-inch and it's a high sense
for those of you who don't know is a
Chinese brand I believe who acquired
Sharp big manufacturer a while back so
they're a pretty big brand of course
more more so overseas than they are here
however I've been hearing you know talks
that they've been making waves and stuff
by um being able to keep cost down
because they're China based and stuff
but actually deliver some some decent
performance oh we're going to put that
to the test the reason why I decided to
go all out with a 4k television for for
my dad is because out of all the people
I know I don't know why I'm holding the
camera like that my parents more than
anyone else need a TV upgrade so badly
right now they have a projection TV and
projection TVs or like they've been
outdated for like ten years at least and
they I don't believe they've changed
like the bulbs are like the original
lamps that were in there so the picture
quality is so the picture is so dim you
can't even see it during the day I don't
honestly don't know how they watch TV
during the day and the second reason why
i justified getting this thing is mainly
for selfish reasons I personally never
even had any hands-on experience with a
4k TV believe it or not I mean I've seen
them like a million times conventions
like at CES and stuff and I've seen them
in other people's homes but I've never
really actually had one in the studio
here so I'm pretty excited to actually
check this out especially if it's if
it's good quality for 500 bucks I might
just get one for myself in the future I
don't know we'll see so yeah we're going
to be doing some testing here obviously
I'm going to take it out of the box look
at the build quality really quick and
then just fire up some and see how
she performs so you know maybe do some
4k streaming on Netflix yeah yeah maybe
maybe I'll do some of that and also some
gaming would be nice because I've gained
very little onto 4k TV in the past I
would like to do some more of it perhaps
today I've got my xa9 test bed here
which I will be trying to connect to the
television maybe drop in GT X 1080 or
two I say maybe because
don't have a high-bandwidth bridge to
actually take full advantage of that SLI
configuration however there's no harm in
trying to see what we can get out of a
standard good ol SLI bridge and since II
just see what happens so should be fun
let's go ahead and take this out of the
box and see what she's made
all right so here's the TV all propped
up and stuff actually setup was super
easy the other two feet on the bottom
there they they just screw in with each
have two screws that just go directly in
from the bottom
super easy installation really and yeah
it looks pretty nice actually you can
see there's like a silver silver bezel
at the bottom and then the the other
three edges of the screen are black so
kind of a two-tone there but it's really
subtle it's not too jarring and the
bezel is pretty thin actually I'm going
to go ahead and measure it really quick
because I'm curious myself so the bezel
is about 7/8 of an inch so a little bit
less than an inch very thin bezel super
slim I like that and you can see I've
got house of cards right here I'm going
to go ahead and play it just give you
guys an idea now this is being up scaled
or not up scale this is just a natively
streamed at 4k you can see I don't know
if you can tell obviously you know
you're it's not the perfect
representation to watch this through a
youtube video but I can tell you right
now it looks really really good
surprisingly sharp for a 500 dollar 4k
TV however there is an issue I don't
know if you guys can tell this either
but there is a soap-opera effect I might
have mentioned that earlier we're gonna
have to disable that in the settings
here in a bit but just just look at that
everything looks pretty good I never
knew what wrinkles were until I watched
Kevin Spacey in 4k ooh the intro this
should be fun
all right so not bad not bad at all and
I'm pretty sure that my parents are
going to be thrilled with this level of
quality however I'm going to go into the
settings here and just take a look let's
go
picture mode this is this is not the
full settings I need the full settings
damn you here we go alright
energy-saving okay so apparently we're
going to get around to the game picture
mode apparently that limits the or
reduces the amount of screen latency and
input lag so I'm curious to see how that
works out we're fine with the do produce
standard for now whose standard
definitely makes it a bit brighter
naturally now let's go to keep
brightness those settings back light
local dimming ooh local dimming wasn't
even on so we can even get some some
richer blacks here by enabling that
backlight at a hundred and B crank this
down a little bit looks a little
overexposed 275 disabled over scan
sharpness looks fine ultra smooth motion
I want this off you turn that off right
now this is this is the refresh
rate that I was talking about noise
reduction sure whatever
and then adaptive contrast we'll leave
it at medium for now
color temperature white balance color
tuner okay those are all the advanced
picture settings alright and if we go
back to our house of cards here it looks
like the soap opera effect is nowhere to
be found
thank thank goodness so apparently
disabling that trumotion BS has has
actually taken effect that's good okay
everything looks good everything checks
out on my end in terms of picture
quality let's see how this bad boy does
with gaming let's go ahead and go back
to that one setting the game mode which
is under picture mode game it's game
time all right time to fire up the
testbed there we go
alright so if I mentioned doom earlier
than I lied because doom doesn't support
SLI at the moment of filming so we're
gonna do GTA 5 instead so in the
graphics you can see here we're at 3840
by 2160 so sixteen by nine resolution
refresh rates we can go ahead and turn
that to sixty because we are using HDMI
2.0 B so we should be able to push that
NSAA I'm going to go ahead and turn this
down
let me turn that off we'll leave effects
AAA for now everything else is pretty
much maxed out scaling and whatnot
distance scaling blahdy blahdy blah
advanced graphics oh yes I will
I will definitely apply this I'm
I'm a man of application okay alright
all the stuff is on except for frame
scaling mode okay so more or less maxed
out with the exception of MSAA and we're
going to go into story mode before we do
that I forgot to load up fraps give me a
sec alright and fraps counter is in the
top left corner it's really tiny I kind
of overlooked that so sorry if you can't
see it but right now we're at a whopping
170 FPS we're hovering
down there in the 170s the 180s from
time to time but holy smokes this is
this is some insane frame rate right
here at 4k mind you we are at four
freaking K this is insane the picture
looks incredible it looks really sharp
super crisp colors are really rich they
seem accurate enough so there is a
noticeable amount of input lag I will
say that and we are in the the game mode
so that should theoretically help things
but it's still not flawless I mean if
you're if you're playing competitively
or something like that if you're a
serious FPS gamer then I would stay away
from gaming on this this type of TV
unless until the input lag situation
just gets better all around it's not
horrible it's playable but you will
notice it especially if you're used to
gaming on a standard monitor don't kill
my friend leave my friend alone
oh no I shot the wrong eye that was the
input lag so yeah I wouldn't say go
ahead and buy one of these TVs for
gaming it's not really what it's going
to be excelling yet however if you're a
casual gamer and you don't mind a little
bit of input lag then the image quality
is freakin awesome well honestly it's
probably unfair of me to say a little
bit of input lag I'm sure most of you
guys are already gaming on a monitor on
an actual gaming monitor or something
with a decent response time and refresh
rate and things like that so if that's
the case then yeah you are gonna notice
it quite a bit with this TV so if you're
a hardcore gamer probably probably don't
want to game on on here but it does look
pretty alright and just for shits and
giggles I'm getting when I'm just
cruising around the streets of Los
Santos this is kind of more of a I don't
know more representative scenario in the
game so getting about a 80 FPS right now
driving through the streets
well anywhere from 80 to 90 so it's
pretty steadily you know floating in the
80's and 90's region with some dips into
the 70s here and there overall though
pretty damn impressive for 4k to GTX 10
80s holy smokes
with the pleb issue sli bridge alright
so just for fun I turned on 4x msaa
just to see how much it would drop down
and we are now rockin around 60 yes but
yeah we probably dips into the 50s high
40s but still very smooth and get get
none of those jaggies even though
they're maybe not quite as visible as
they would be at a lower resolution and
I lost Lamar okay
on that note let's wrap this up alright
so to sum up this little endeavor here
pretty good TV honestly for the price
it's really good 50 inches 4k it's a
smart TV and it up scales well
everything looks great the 4k streaming
with with Netflix is top-notch wouldn't
recommend it for gaming less you're
doing something really casual but for
just day-to-day use and for viewing you
know media that's not interactive I
suppose it does the job it's really good
so I've again put links in the
description below if you want to check
that out let me know what you guys think
of this video guys toss me a like on it
if you enjoyed it and thank you guys so
