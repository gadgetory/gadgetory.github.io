person especially for drinking
oh yeah but like worth it like really
worth it everyone had different things
and everyone was like this is some of
the best food I've ever had this is the
best whatever category of that food is
I've ever had yeah that was that was the
quote of the night wifey sauce tracked
that place down yes also it was also
like served to everyone he's it like
don't notice me give me Erica yeah like
like white sauce is vegan where you even
begin to gia fish no I had yeah fish
like whether you just see vegan anything
like everyone had really good Jo had
like this massive 14 ounce ribeye was
also really good guys good be your
selection to turn the mics up just to go
to harvest harvest at Bellagio though no
peeking that allowed to peek no peeking
alright I think we should be left both
at this point it should be live so we
can get on to it let's go everyone
welcome back to awesome hardware it's
been a while this is episode 174 right
where we left off nothing about the show
has really changed part from know we're
still late all the time 2019 now it's
2019 so there's a little difference
there but we're still gonna be late on
every stream we're still drinking beer
Paul's got a nice Arrogant Bastard ale
from stone I'm slumming it up with a Bud
Light Clamato Mitch Ilana because you
know it's only been a couple days since
we got it so I've been a couple days
since we left Vegas I'm still feeling
pretty rough and raw
joe-joe was I feeling dirty at the
handle in the chill-out is in Vegas yeah
he's my chill-out a brother we bond over
geladas but thank you very much for
joining us this is a live stream in case
you're new here that Poe and I do every
single Tuesday mostly every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right
here on twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
we also stream to both of our channels
in two halves today the first half is
streamed to my channel youtube.com slash
bit wits and then about half an hour so
we're gonna switch over to Paul's
channel youtube.com slash Paul's
hardware which you can find the link to
the actual stream his side be in my
video description we also like to have a
good time and and try to sell you things
we have lots of fun trying to get you
guys to spend money on us
you get some cooled merchandise in
return so you can go to my store bit
with tech for all kinds of things like
shirts hoodies mugs pint glasses mouse
pads desk mats the list really goes on
bottle openers the like they're all very
good things everything everything was
super top-notch equality budget spinners
clip this is the fidget spitter I don't
know there must be like one or two digit
spinner I'll be glad to see those
finally gone they've been taking up too
much space on the site for a while
myself your store is Paul's hardware not
net team do you wanna buy something from
Paul store he's also got a variety of
great things like his this scoop-neck
hoodie is a limited edition limited
edition oh yeah looks good everyone go
buy it very clean it's cold it's cold
right now wherever you are right now I
bet you probably freaking cold go go buy
a hoodie wearing if you happen to buy
anything you're gravy right now Yeah
right I like how its trick right right
on the upper tit I'm also wearing my
dead what is that this is my Infinity
Ward or Joe got me Oh
Bannos infinity war popular movie for
brighter that shirt is not available in
either of our stores that would be
there'd be illegal that's true it's not
really pull enough cuz Joe got it for me
oh cool that's good it's a good gift
from Joe he knows he knows your style so
if you guys buy anything from either of
our stores will yell Johnson at you at
the end that's how we do it
yep and apart from that we have news to
talk about was there anything I missed
it's been supposed to be on the show
think so we don't have any sponsors for
this this episodes yeah that's cool yeah
we're not making jack we're straight
they cool great
alright let's dive right in then I
wanted to take things you know I just
wanted to keep it casual for from my
half you know I want to start off with
some of our favorites that we found at
CES 2019 this year it's it's still very
fresh in our mind the whole event there
it's all the cool tech that we found
I completely forgot to make one factor
Dennis CES lower thirds before there
probably is I don't know how far back
that fully you have goes let's do 2015
recap yeah sure yeah I still that's how
far the folder goes back I'll 2022 any
cap and yep there's none from CES
literally 3 CSS and of 2015 on the shelf
that must have been a long-winded
segment for us to cover an entire year
now single no that's that's good beer no
wonder we've never done it again yes so
um I want to just mention a couple I
think we should just alternate and I'll
mention a product and we can both talk
about it and then you'll mention a
product we'll go back and forth for a
little bit no it's been too long on it
but the first thing that I saw that I
didn't actually see because I didn't get
a chance to visit their booth was a
razor and their Raptor 27 inch quad HD
monitor I saw their booth from a
distance me too and I passed it a couple
times if it just didn't actually have an
appointment was to slammed but this
looked like one of the cooler things
probably in like hard knee shove tech
space that I saw you know razor has been
coming out with some pretty cool
products for every for the last few CES
estrella I had that one modular PC that
he was just strictly a prototype and for
the walls but this seems like it could
actually come to market I'd be able to
buy it which piques my interest even
more and then there was like Valerie
which still no one's ever found the the
stolen the stolen prototype and it seems
like they're not gonna razor themselves
aren't gonna follow up on that as a real
product but this seems like it could
actually be something you could buy and
put in your setup so this is kind of
interesting it looks really nice it's
got very a very like sort of
non-traditional wide aluminum stand with
base lighting some RGB base lighting of
course this is a RGB that's a cable
management system I feel like each of
those are a different video I'm not sure
if they're pre-installed at an HDMI and
a power and a display port they go
through those right all right then okay
and then you know hopefully it's the
right length you know the right fixed
length or whatever that you're looking
for you need like sweet green razor
cables now that probably cost like like
the same as monster cables it's good
marketing cuz you're like now that my
monitor cables are green I should
probably get other things like other
peripherals with green chats freezer
what a perfect option chats pointing out
there's no it doesn't look like there's
a vase amount on the back here
I think Razer wants you to use that
stand yeah yeah that's part of their
part of their deal but vase amounts
pretty Universal and I agree it's it's
not that hard of a thing to integrate it
no I'm sure there are engineers that
have some explanation for that guy so in
order to make it
this we had did not do that because
doesn't like folds down right you kind
of fold down flat looks like it yeah not
that we have pictures of that good
chance to get hands-on with it but looks
really mad 144 hurts for millisecond
response time if you're using pixel
overdrive one millisecond with motion
blur reduction 95 percent DCI p3 with
HDR support fairly wide color gamut
they're razor thin bezels if I do say so
myself
can hardly see them on their excitement
for maybe at the bottom one and again
cable manager in the back $6.99 for this
panel $6.99 which i think is fairly
competitive for a quad HD 144 hertz IPS
display these days I should also mention
as freesync freesync
okay so it's a freesync display yeah not
a g-sync correct and I feel it but now
g-sync will work a freesync displays
more on that on my half of the show
g-sync will work with freezing displays
you mean nvidia cards will work with yes
yeah yeah right as of today yes because
you'll be talking about that on your
hair yes yeah absolutely
so I guess that you know there's a bit
more flexibility here that with this
product that kind of thing if they knew
that the the freesync gsync thing was
coming that's why they're like let's
just make this free sink rather than
probably pay probably whatever is
required for them you probably could get
a free sigmata with the exact same specs
for cheaper than $6.99 but there is of
course that sexy razor aesthetic premium
I think that that's always stapled on to
their products and if this is it is very
nicely if this is one of the higher-end
27-inch wqhd IPS high refresh rate
monitors yep then per that would be a
higher likelihood that it would pass in
videos rigorous g-sync for freesync
monitors testing process which they go
through most likely so will what to see
yep well touch on that later
and then the other thing you want to do
the product something that you Sharon if
it's something that I talked about oh
yeah of course there's slipstream
wireless technology took a look at this
briefly I did I did
the mouse the thing that I was most
impressed about this mouse with honestly
was the price it's 50 bucks
mhm and it's like you're talking about
the harpoon or GB Craig yeah the harpoon
with slipstream yeah
neither which neither of those are it's
the one in the background that one there
it is that's it right there yeah 50
bucks 50 bucks and it's great for travel
because I can't yeah it's got a real
clean design comfortable in the hand
it's that's on the smaller side but
that's you know it's portable and
everything yeah I'm run switches yeah
I'm around switches it just it just
feels like a really premium Mouse 50
bucks
plus the wireless technology which yeah
of course there has developed so it's RF
base it's still it's not using some
magic wireless technology that's never
been used before right it's just their
own proprietary connection which allows
them to have sub 1 millisecond response
time yeah 500 microseconds actually half
right it's also get dual band connection
right where the can almost frequency hop
over the Wi-Fi yes for more reliability
and speed so much much in the same way
if you've ever looked at if you've ever
looked at Wi-Fi trackers that go and
there's actually different bands that
Wi-Fi can can operate on some might be
more crowded than the others so nicer
Wi-Fi devices will jump between those to
find less crowded the frequencies yes
credit frequency this will do the same
thing mm-hmm
I don't I don't know exactly how many
different like ranges it has to switch
between excuse me but it has pretty good
battery life up to 60 hours of life on a
single charge that's on Bluetooth bear
in mind you will have less battery life
if you are using the slipstream
technology because that response time
requires more constant communication so
that's right eat up the battery a little
bit faster right if I'm gaming on a
plane in the next two three years I'm
using this exact mouse if I'm gaming on
a plane or any compact just travel space
present something compact presumably
it's it's FAA you know kosher and
everything is a wireless device I'm not
sure that's a good question enough
turnout does it have an airplane mode of
course you can't still plug it in it's
got a sometimes I don't even turn my
phone on it's got a USB cable that it
connects up to so you can just use the
USB cable to plug it into so nice -
seems like a nice full-featured premium
corsair mouse with multiple wireless
function
like I like the Bluetooth connectivity
too because sometimes you just want a
mouse to connect to your laptop and you
don't want to plug in any dongles or
anything like that so right connect via
bluetooth bluetooth is not good for
gaming bear that in mind speaking of the
dongle the slipstreaming technology
allows you to connect multiple
slipstream supporting devices to a
single dongle I believe the one that
this one comes included with you can
connect up to two but they're actually
going to be releasing this implementing
this wireless technology into other
peripherals like headsets and keyboards
and those will since there's more data
especially with like headsets since
there's more data being transmitted
large larger data sets they're gonna
require larger dongles but they'll also
be able to connect more devices so I
think you'll be able to connect like
three slipstream devices to one of those
so I'll be interesting to see what they
do and suppose supposedly with
slipstream you're supposed to get closer
to a wired mic type of voice quality
even though it's all wireless so we'll
have to see if I'm interesting to see
that applied to like voice
communications as well like where the
quality becomes slightly more important
than the speed right yeah and and the
range as well the range is supposed to
be increased as well and I will say I
don't I don't mind a larger size dongle
neither do it I never minded a nice
thick that thick dongle because you know
I'd rather have the if the size is gonna
improve the connection or you know make
it so that if I put it behind you know
if I set something behind a laptop
screen or something like it's not going
to suddenly cause interference or
something like that yeah so cool yeah
that's the Corsair that if the other -
slipstream specifically the wireless
technology that the harpoon uses and
yeah 30 bucks 30 bucks next step we have
the asus rog matrix 20 80 TI with a
built in area cooler this is the very
first CES I did not go to the Asus
before didn't even go to AC I really
didn't even go I told some people that
and their minds were blown how could you
not go to Asus but you went to Asus you
saw this card in person I deliver I
carry asleep through all the videos and
I thought oh if there was one thing I
wanted to see if the Asus booth it was
this card how was it it was pretty cool
it was pretty cool because I completely
did like a double take
I I mean they showed me the card I
immediately assumed oh it's like another
Poseidon yeah it's you not familiar with
these who's Poseidon cards they have air
cooling and then this got a water block
integrated so you can connect up yeah
and all in one you can connect up a
custom water cooling loop to it your
water quality - they were sort of
explaining this to me as I go okay they
did this city this and then and then I
got to a point I was like wait hold on
you mean the radiator and the pump but
everything is all included in this it's
it's an all-in-one GPU liquid cooler
than the shrimp's also built into the
shroud as a GPU itself which is still
not ridiculously huge it's a big card
it's triple slot it's triple slot but
that's still yeah their triple slot air
coolers yeah considering everything we
got going on in there hexxus has their
own embedded player that's very bold of
them I just wanted to close up with the
card there it is but anyway yeah it's
it's a cool looking card clean looking
card they also had the GPU plate the
actual cold plate that they're showing
and just the comparison it's much wider
one a much larger one oh that's it right
lot of surface area there more surface
area it's wide enough to go and cover
the memory modules as well as the GPU
nice so yeah you can you can see that's
cool whoa slow zoom so slow pull pull
all right but the matrix itself you know
it's got all the 2080 ice banks CUDA
cores a nice boost clock it's like one a
crowd like this you look at the boost
clock 1815 you're like well that's kind
of minimum right that's right that's
you're starting off point because you
should be running this much higher than
that yeah yeah just a really cool
accomplishment from Asus and the design
and engineering going into this they
said they've been working on it for like
two years so so well then it's awesome
you know we got it we got to get it into
the hands of some independent reviewers
and stuff like that but yeah they said
it is on par with linking up your GPU to
a 240 millimeter all-in-one liquid
cooler that's a bold claim that I have
both true but you know and I'm sure
there's some some specifics there but
even if it's close to that
and being on store exam do that still
still pretty cool so yeah like it almost
made me when I went to EVGA and like oh
here's the kingpin yeah you know and the
kingpin with all the power delivery and
stuff and the kingpin to be fair they're
kind of also assuming that you know when
Vince actually uses it he's not going to
use the cooler that they made there with
the all-in-one but I look at the kingpin
as like oh it's got this cooler 120
millimeter rad hanging after that me is
that really necessary now it looks so
dated that no 2018 that said take the
coolers off of both of these cards and
then I would be very interested to see
this card versus two kingpins we're in
an overclocking competition but we'll
leave that to Jay and Steve I guess yeah
they battle it out yeah because I don't
think I'm getting wired to either of
these probably not neither does but cool
yeah that's cool that's cool product
yeah
next up we have the the gigabyte Oris
monitor that I actually did get a chance
to try out yeah 2 gigabyte Sweden in
there darkened cave yes room yeah your
mind are you one of those like film film
room like film caves like I have on set
so they can like color correct live
while they're shooting and stuff
completely blacked out hey I was like
dude if any of these monitors out where
there is light to still a prototype to
be fair they're doing it so that you
know you're in a darkened merriest of
the monitors you're looking at what's on
screen more that's why they did it was
reflects conducive at all for her color
making videos of the product yeah
especially when you can't show off like
the 10-bit color that it has or like the
is it 98% DCI p3 this one is not 98 this
one was 92 oh 92 oh the only one that
was 98 that I saw actually was
LG's and those aren't coming out to q3
okay I'm not sure if it's listed on this
one somewhere between 90 and 95 percent
DCI p3 yeah so good color is also really
good and then it also had so just for
the record 24-inch 1440p IPS hundred and
forty-four Hertz all the specs that you
know you're looking for in like a really
good sixteen by nine gaming
high-end but I think the thing that
stuck out to me most was were two things
the OSD which is crazy
the OSD kind of functions almost like a
software or just a regular program in
the OS where you can like drag and drop
you can like you can drag the the the
actual screen the OSD around your
monitor around the screen and it's super
intuitive like you don't have to fiddle
with any of the hardware buttons yeah on
on the monitor itself it's also super
cheating it's super cheating because you
know like any because it's all done in
the firmware on the monitors no there's
there's no there's no way to software
detect what's going on exactly you can
just you can create like a crosshair
overlay like a reticle overlay if you
wanted to in any design you want there's
like built-in counters I mean it's a
very sophisticated aim stabilizer right
yes that's that's not cheating gigabyte
but yeah that increases like the
perceived like smoothness or sharpness
of the motion on screen as well yeah you
got across there with a bunch of those
that you can put on there and then
there's there's on screen step did you
see them demo that you're supposed to be
able to show like frame rate and stuff
yeah oh yeah it's almost like an acai
afterburner OSD right like the overlay
there
it's everything's hot cable you can
assign your own hotkeys just for all the
functions it's super easy but yeah they
have like keep you temp CPU time clock
speeds everything you can just bring up
on on display and like you said like
Paul said completely hardware based so
it's you know it won't get detected by
any of your software programs and it's
also gonna reduce the amount of system
resources that that are required to run
it yeah like the most unique feature for
me was probably the the noise cancelling
that was really cool but it was also
like sort of a weird thing where you're
like aren't there headsets that are kind
of designed to do that
like what like the monitor doing it you
you got a pipe all your sound through
the monitor to do that true
I think that's why they were demoing it
with like a crappy pair of head but yeah
your buds whatever it's like you know
you don't need to have that technology
built into your headset the monitor loop
for you and there's 95% of the DC
a spectrum yeah I remember today I had
put that in my video description and
this is $100 cheaper than the razor
panel $5.99 that's it it's a good price
I don't know it's good price I think I'd
pick this over the razor one hey they're
here I think the razor one looks cooler
but this one just has more cool tech
built into it and then the last thing
that I want to talk about here for CES
that of course caught us all by storm a
little bit was the AMD Radeon 7 and this
is a perfect transition into our next
segment which is the rumor mill because
we can talk about the card while we
discuss the latest rumors that just
surfaced today yeah at the same time so
this is an article from WCF Tech where
better to get rumors from AMD's Radeon
Vegas 7 is rumored to have less than 5
thousand units made globally confirmed
to also have 64 ro piece as opposed to
the 128 that it was originally
speculated to have botched FP 64 compute
compared to instinct MI 150 so this was
originally a rumor that WCC of tech had
taken it from tweak town so what better
rumour 4wc CF tech the rumour site of
all to take from the the second rumour
site of all time tree town I would just
rather go to WC I just linked WCC of
tech because they don't have a bunch of
shitty autoplay ads on their site so
less than 5,000 units made each card
would be sold at a loss of course
because they're they're just repurposed
instinct m150 parts that could have been
sold for a lot higher to thee to the HPC
market but if they're not fully
functioning and functioning instinct
GPUs then aren't they just sort of
making money out of what would have
otherwise been a GPU that they had to
scrap I guess it depends on how like if
they actually nerfed it or if they if
they just the silicon came out that way
and they couldn't they couldn't sell
them as those instinct cards anyway I
guess just just depends
are we getting nerfed cards that were
manually nerfed by AMD that they just
manually disabled it or were they just
like lower quality wafers that came off
like what we can't how are we gonna
repurpose things this is the mean like
the main reason need the thing you'd
look at and be like though they're these
must be instinct chips these clearly
weren't designed for pure gaming
purposes is the fact that it's got 16
gigs of HP m2 memory right which which
no game no game needs you know it's nice
to have it there for sure and like it
kind of makes it really cool as a like a
crossover card yeah if you're really
going to do some GPU compute stuff
that's heavy on the memory bandwidth or
needs a lot of memory then this would be
a great card for you especially if you
game at the same time especially got a
free sync monitor I mean they'd be super
sweet yeah it's like a thread receipt
for you ooh yeah it's 24 cores it's
definitely not designed for gaming but
it can but it can game so nerfed
compared to an instinct card but an
instinct card costs what 1,500 bucks I
don't I don't know I'm know the price
but it's a shit ton I never paid that
much that close of attention because
they have no use for me
these are $6.99 the biggest Radeon 7 699
right I want to say $6.99 I think that's
right so I think you're right I should
the instinct car that you're talking
about it's probably around double
Ballpark
yeah $6.99 yes yeah so so yeah it seems
like they are that they might be cutting
the loss here and they are definitely
carrying it to both content creators
workstation professionals and gamers
simultaneously which is interesting I
guess that's you know maybe a little
sell more units that way so it's a
marketing thing but the other thing that
leads us to believe that they might only
be selling 5000 units is that there's
reportedly gonna have this card's
reportedly not going to have any custom
boards custom models there's gonna be no
adding board partner interference or
relations there so it's basically just
gonna be this card the way it looks
reference design from AMD and nothing
else which if you're only selling 5000
units I mean that's nothing it'll sell
out in an hour after after launch
there's really no point in
custom models so that's what I heard
from AMD - yeah yes yeah you heard it
from an actual AMD rep and stuff so that
definitely says ask you the first
question when you see a reference design
for a graphics card you're like Oh are
there Adam board partner cards right are
they are you expecting them soon yeah is
there going to be a delay
Reince the answer was probably not
happening as I go that's different yeah
that's unexpected and that's when I
started you know getting the visa gears
roll and I was like alright maybe this
isn't exactly what you think it is this
card that you know normally you have a
crowd like it's like here's the Radeon
seven and then here's the you know
Radeon five or whatever they're going to
do and have a cut-down version of it or
something like that and make different
product lines and have an on-board
partner versions right doesn't seem like
what they're doing let's this card right
as a limited run special card and
whether that's valuable to you or not
you can make that decision for yourself
or you can stick around for my half when
we're going to pull your opinions on it
look at all these tie-ins to the first
in this one it's a Kevin oh what a web
we weave - brilliant so I think you know
I think the reason why they might have
launched this or announced this at CES
and why they did this whole Radeon 7
thing in the first place was to kind of
maybe offer a stopgap between their
production cycle to sort of challenge in
videos high-end just just a little bit
just temporarily until they can get more
seven animator products up and running
for real and actually create them in
manufacture them in volume because
they're still clearly they were ways to
go there but I think Nvidia or I'm sorry
AMD's been feeling the pressure on the
GPU side from Nvidia obviously because
Nvidia now has like almost like lapped
them with like the ten series and now
the r-tx
the family whereas ambu still kind of
just resting on these year-olds rx Vega
cards as far as the high-end goes you
know that's all they really have to show
and I feel like CES is like sort of that
event where people are gonna you know in
companies are gonna announce their best
tech moving forward for the year and I
think even though this was a limited run
and Andy knew that they wanted to have
something to somewhat challenge Nvidia
to let the masses know hey we're still
in the game we're still planning to
stay competitive in some way even if it
is just this is just a stopgap type of
product I don't know
well it'll be interesting to see how
these perform if they are more geared
for gamers or for workstation or if
they're somewhere in between an antics
Ryan Smith however did confirm in other
news that these cards will ship with 64
or Opie's rasterized operations per
second not the alleged 128 our Opie's
that were being reported a few hours
after the card got announced because 128
our Opie's is what the instinct and 150s
ship with so a lot of people were
actually excited when when they first
thought that there would be 128 or
Opie's on board because that would be a
really good that would make this card a
really good option price-wise for for
the compete space but we're learning now
that that is definitely not the case
it's been confirmed and bloody bloody
blah so it has been nerfed in in ways
that don't just affect gaming but the
sort of compute and workstation space as
well let's see AMD CTO mark Papermaster
I always like saying mark paper master
paper master wizard
I think of the the page master yeah and
from the Disney movie out it could all
go Lloyd confirmed that more seven
animator products well released in 2019
that's exciting 790 meter is is is very
much do
AMD's been twiddling around with 40
nanometer for several years now so
finally more seven animator products are
on the way it'll be interesting to see
if they're just going to replace out all
of the the RX I'm sorry all of the the
Polaris based Vega cards like RX v 7d +
RX 580 and they're just gonna you know
kind of like clean out the the
entry-level and mid-range or if they're
gonna attack the high-end market and try
to stick it to in video with some some
really like hard-hitting cards just just
clarify enemies your Vega in there and I
don't think I'm sorry not to keep me
pilars I'm posters players just just
straight players yeah yes
but yeah it'll be interesting I hope I
hope because I feel like we have we
already have enough mid-range cards I
would like more competition in the
high-end space because
nvidia r-tx cards are getting seemingly
just more expensive because they can
although the r-tx 2060 has launched
route around 350 bucks so that's today
yeah also launched today pretty exciting
so much going on today
yeah I really be talking about that on
your half RTX 2016 all no okay
I mean I'm gonna point out that at lunch
today so so yes it'll be a sequel to
what I just said
perfect can't wait with more vigor can't
wait for the follow-up alright next
rumor that we have what is this I
mentioned this is the rumor mill 8990 XE
yeah just keep saying known for a while
the I $9.99 1914 cores this is hardcore
WCF Creek what yeah we're 9999 80s 1980
XE has more course and yet it's it's
skewed lower in terms of nomenclature
than this processor why would they do
that Paul it's because this one clocks
higher which makes things infinitely
more confusing to the end user and the
reviewer
so yes the current 98 99 80 sorry is a
is an 18 core processor is an 18 core
but it's slower than the 9990 XE which
has fewer course but is faster so it's
very you can stay with me stay with me
they show called it the 99 98 know cuz
in the end 40 right well then I'm 44 x
is a 14 core yes
that's greater than 40 X plus
superclocked super super clock it's like
don't don't take no it's really stupid
what lose semblance of a naming scheme
you have this really done sort of follow
and throw it out the window
just to try to pretend like you're
coming out with a higher end processor
even though it's only got 14 cords
because let's face it they're probably
like we want to come out with a 5
gigahertz we're at 5 gigahertz
then we want to come up with 5 gigahertz
high-end desktop processor and the 14
core was the best they could do
with right hit that frequency right in
any sort of volume that they could sell
it as an individual product and then
because marketing is stupid yeah and
marketers like well it's new it's got a
higher number yes exactly
no one's gonna buy it if it's a lot it's
gonna seem like the lesser chip but
irritates a crap out of me it does and
it honestly it dampens my initial
impression of what I would be like Oh
fourteen core processor running at five
gigahertz like let's focus on that
yeah no no instead of focus on this
stupid stupid crybabies
yeah it really is dumb what else I I
completely agree with you Paul about
this press it still has the same PCIe
lanes 44 PCA lanes still supports ddr4
2666 but it's supposed to be better at
gaming and some workstation loads that
that favor clock speed
sure that's why not that is amazing I
would never have expected that no job -
it does have a much higher TDP than the
99 80 XE because of that faster clock
speed so it's got 90 watts over the 99
899 ATX C at 255 watts and 25 so make
sure that your motherboard if you're
gonna be buying one of these things of
course is is planned accordingly to be
able to handle that additional power
delivery and the coolers but your
cooling solution should be amazing maybe
get one of those 60 at least I would say
those enter max tr4 they're not the
tenner max liquid tech twos oh yeah but
you survived a 500 watt dissipation
those are really great units these CPUs
will be sold to get them - it's a - now
don't get the first version no there
were some issues with the first it's
prone to catastrophic failure - - they
may be the number on the two so CPUs the
CPUs so it may not matter you know it's
still gonna matter the CPUs will be sold
to s eyes mainly or custom OEMs PC OEMs
so retail availability will be slim I
was gonna say that makes it a little
better because then people will get
confused but people are still gonna be
looking at the specs of pre belts you're
still gonna be looking at you know what
CP is this and this SI system have
the other so yeah it's just it's exactly
what you said they were around meeting I
remember it's a Bandhan overclocked
$2.99 40 X basically for 700 more
dollars is this an official price to
2,000 or is it a speculator Thank You
Lane this is all rumor mill that we're
in right now so this is all rumored but
yeah we're gonna estimate around 2000
for now which is about the same price as
the 18 core does oh gosh I'm having a
brain first the hero calm down mommy
will be home very soon CPU CPU lottery
silica Madhuri ooh the 14 core now the
company silicon Madhuri
oh right yeah that are guaranteed to
overclock maybe you can get a ninety
nine forty how much do they sell obtain
ninety nine forty X I can hit that is
your bargain 9990 XE yeah right yeah and
my absolutely true that's the beating
Intel at their own game
yep potentially depending on what
they're selling for um alright our last
rumor of the day is a juicy one Apple's
chip guru Johnny Stroud gee I have no
idea if I pronounced that right someone
correct me for uncle reportedly is on
Intel's shortlist for CEO candidate Oh
was an article from Business Insider but
everyone's talking about it just give me
the sort of current situation it's been
about six months since Intel had an
active CEO their former CEO Brian
krzanich
Zack resigned after the company
investigation found he was having an
affair with employee which is a big
no-no for execs and managers of the
company it was consensual it was
consensual but still an affair still no
no he was a married man Chris and if
only if only cruise antics could keep it
in his pants we wouldn't be having to
talk about this article today
rumors are following that it followed a
Bloomberg's report that several several
talked about candidates are no longer in
the running including former motorola
CEO Sanjay Jha and two former Intel
executives anand challenger seeker
qualcomm president and ranae james that
you know that it looks like strategy is
now in the running for sure he's like
he's on the top two top three running
candidates at the moment now Apple's
strategy leads the company currently in
their in-house chip development which is
a pretty big role and it's caused Apple
to withdraw even more if it's business
away from Intel so Intel is probably
looking at this guy going hey if we hire
this guy then maybe he can strengthen
the relations our relations with our one
of our biggest customers which is Apple
and they will pull away from us because
there's been a lot of speculation that
Apple is actually planning to pull
completely away from Intel and be
completely self-sufficient with their
own CPUs now you're clipping a little
bit according to Chet
sorry I just get very excited about this
stuff I wanted to do a more in-depth
audio tuning pass-through before we
started today's show did not have that
opportunity but at least you can hear us
right as long as we speak in measured
voices I think it's fine I'm either I'm
either adjusting audio on a mixing board
or I'm tuned in Tokyo or I'm pinching
someone's nipples all right so you could
be a really big win for Intel if they
can land this huge this massive giant
Apple chip designer now if if Apple
abandons Intel anyway strategy may have
what it takes to help Intel push through
its manufacturing hurdles but believe it
or not I probably clipped when you said
but sorry but I'll try to be more
reserved sorry the micheladas doing a
number on me this guy maybe this
strategy guy may be out of intel's
league who could be how could you
possibly be out of Intel's league
couldn't Intel just like you just say a
number and Intel's like yeah I'll just
pay that that's fine done deal but
apparently not when this guy was
promoted to senior VP of hardware
technologies in 2015 at Apple Apple gave
him 10 million dollars of restricted
stock that vested over four years and
right before that four year mark before
that money was about to fall into his
pocket
Apple doubled down on his offerings so
this guy landed 24 million dollars in
total compensation in 2017 thank you for
compressing me Paul which is more than
CEO Tim Cook
home in the same year with a measly 13
million so your move-in tell if you
really want this guy you got it you got
to shell out the big bucks
apparently 24 mil not not a bad year
salary for uh there's a very Apple photo
he is there to its full white background
yeah
headshot Apple like Apple marketing
lives in a universe where there's just
nothing it's like a universe of
nothingness just white like you're dead
there's only there's only like in the
void it makes sense they trademark their
clean design it's like an infinite
infinite amount of cleanness it's a lot
of white paint so I don't know that's
you know it'll be interesting to see if
if they actually scoop this guy up if
they can serenade him with the right
check him out or or if he's gonna tell
him to suck it it says he's worth 24
million dollars so it's pretty dug out
on par with us I was running around
right that's that's what I get for guys
the new Mike's see now I'm peeking no
I'm totally peek now you're peeking that
I don't know I'm glad it's not really me
like it's just a big light isn't coming
up what about on xsplit is always look
low check check never trust xsplit
that's true why is it green on the right
of your way no I'm on the full meter
this yeah it's green on the right up
here yeah mine's like because you can
you can in xsplit you can go in and you
can tell it what the max volume can be
so you can tell it's a hundred and
thirty percent or hundred or two hundred
percent or something and that again goes
back to like I need to go and do a like
start to finish process of the sound
here with testing and everything there's
there sort of a procedure for doing that
right I have not done that and I've also
switched back and forth because I only
have two phantom powered inputs here and
both of our lav mics go into that now
suddenly it seems really loud why is
that's why am i so loud all of a sudden
check check yeah yeah I'll do my best
so we'll serenade you so you know could
have done that but you know everyone
wants us to start on time we get a bunch
of crap like Oh everyone's late we can't
make your cake and eat it too people my
bad we're only human but that's all for
my hand I'm gonna trust metal six maniac
says I only peaked once so should be
fine should be fine that's right yeah
I'm done so it's your turn all right
thanks for thanks for that Kyle we're
gonna cut off Kyle's half we're gonna
continue on my half in just a minute I'm
gonna pet the dog in between if anyone
wants new time stamps in the comments oh
we love you we love you ten filmmakers
thanks guys we'll be right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
