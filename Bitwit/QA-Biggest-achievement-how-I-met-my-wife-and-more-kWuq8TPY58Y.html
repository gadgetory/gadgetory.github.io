below what's going on guys
welcome back to the channel hope you're
all doing well I've got wifey sauce here
with me today we're gonna be doing a Q &amp;amp;
A for the first time in years on the
channel I used to do the answer me
dammit segment which was basically just
QA under a funny name and then I just
just never did it again after like three
or four episodes so we're back you guys
actually tweeted me some pretty
interesting questions and I'm gonna be
trying to answer them truthfully and
openly today so wifey sauce is gonna be
helping me out with that yes you do yes
you do so let's say I'm sure you know I
did consult the internet for this so
it's bound to end badly so let's let's
get on with it the first question is
what do you feel has been your greatest
accomplishment in the tech industry oh
wow
starting with the hard ones okay I
remember how much joy was brought to me
the first time I ever built the PC and
booted it up and I hear all these
stories from people now in the comments
saying like hey you helped me build my
first PC and it was like awesome you
know I loved your tutorials I loved all
your videos and your build guides and
things like that and so I think that's
something that I'll probably never stop
being proud of it's kind of like VR like
one of my favorite things about VR and
having a VR headset is showing it to
other people you know what I mean it's
like watching their reaction like it's
Christmas morning or something never
gets old
alright next question is what's one
thing you would change about the tech
tube scene I wish there was more variety
there's a lot of top 10 videos and a lot
of the same stuff and it forces me to
sort of challenge ourselves and create
more interesting dynamic content but
yeah I'd like to see more more diversity
I'd like to see one of the top 5 tubers
in the world be a tech channel maybe one
day how did you and
wifey sauce me wedding anniversary
mm-hmm August 7th 2015 yeah so we first
met at a house party that you were
hosting it was your house or is your
parents house we were in college or I
was my I was a week away from graduating
and I was invited to a house party you
were there obviously and we kind of hit
it off and the party got broken up at
the last minute because someone's car
got stolen so I had to quickly bounce
and then I hit you up later either I got
your number or Facebook or something and
then I was like hey you want to hang out
and like you know eat dinner with me I
didn't like to call it a date I think I
didn't really know either because I
didn't want to like put that pressure on
to it I just like hey you wanna hang out
before tinder I think by the end of the
night though I figured it out out of all
the builds you did the past few years
which one is your favorite hot line it
will always have number one in my in my
heart close second with the first PC I
ever built inside of the Corsair 600 T
with a twenty six hundred K and GTX 670
third place if if we're just talking
more recently in the last year or two I
would say the silver build I think I
think that was
October's PC of the month last year and
that thing is freaking gorgeous every
time I look at that video I'm just like
oh it's also one of those pcs that I
have not yet fully disassembled I think
I like remove the arrow but everything
else is still intact because I just I
can't bring myself to taking it apart
and so it's so pretty next question is
kind of funny when making cereal do you
pour the milk in the bowl first or the
cereal the cereal this is about this is
obvious wait there are people out there
who pour the milk first is is that real
no way yes because because if you just
pour the milk in first then the milk
splashes there's nothing to brace the
impact ale of the milk well and it's
like how do you really know how much
milk you need
pour the cereal on first cuz you know
cuz I could drink milk for days but I'm
limited on how much cereal I really want
eat in any given moment so I'll do the
cereal first and there are so many
reasons why you would do the cereal
first I further investigation needs to
be done into this question video guides
from big youtubers and it could be cool
lmao yeah you know I I totally get it
you know some people prefer like people
have their OS of choice and some people
like PC building but just prefer the Mac
OS and I think that it would be a niche
a niche video with niche appeal but I
still think it'd be interesting because
I've never done one before I guess I've
just kind of never really taken the
opportunity to do it and I haven't
really heard that many requests if
that's something you guys would be
interested in hackintosh build let me
know in the comments it's something that
I would be willing to look into so he's
talking about floatplane which I just
joined Linus and his crews new platform
which you guys should go check it out
but floatplane is not meant to replace
youtube it's meant as an extension of
YouTube for hardcore fans or viewers who
want to support creators like myself or
Linus or whoever in just in just another
way that goes beyond the simple like
comment and subscribe I think that
they're both going to be working in
tandem for me for for quite some time
and have no immediate plans to leave
youtube I feel like YouTube would ban my
channel or just screw me over royally
before I ever decide to leave that
YouTube would break up with me first
okay next question do you still regret
pointing that bottle at your face oh my
god no I don't regret it because
otherwise it would have never happened
and it was one of the best moments that
Paul and I ever had on one stream which
is kind of depressing but also it's
hilarious and a lot of people found it
super funny so I'm totally all for
people laughing or having a good time at
mic
and and it made it into the Twitter
gifts it did or Twitter gifs yeah
absolutely
what went through your mind when the
bottle exploded in your face oh my
second thought was is my laptop gonna
die because there was beer all over my
laptop and my phone yeah I still can't
connect to Wi-Fi on my phone I might
have to get a new phone just because the
Wi-Fi doesn't work anymore yeah and then
the other thing was going through my
head was is this gonna make me internet
famous I'm sure enough sure enough now
everyone in the world knows who I am
scariest moment of your life
I'd say August 7th 2015 I was scared
that you weren't okay when I first
watched Frankenstein as a kid I hated
Frankenstein my aunt let me watch it and
she's a terrible aunt you ready for the
hot seat okay would you like more - or
Luke whose whose - pineapple on pizza
no it's nothing it's nothing that I've
ever drank it
I've never craved pineapple on pizza
Pizza should not be sweet it should be
salty tangy and savory and delicious
don't put fruit on my freakin pizza
that's what it is yeah no fruit it's not
a summer pizza last question hit me what
made you finally pulled the trigger and
get an office slash and dedicated
YouTube space I would say space was a
primary concern boxes boxes everywhere
in the living room in the hallway in the
garage this is at home of course and we
just needed to I couldn't even think I
couldn't be creative I couldn't buy new
equipment like a slider I couldn't even
fit a slider in my room at one point
because it was just so claustrophobic I
was constantly yelling I'm Kyle Kyle why
is this box here Kyle Bob and if we ever
wanted
chance of hiring someone in the future
we needed to have an off-site location
right there was just no way that you
know like we could have had Chris who's
interning for us currently work in that
environment it was just yeah so we're
much happier here and hopefully you guys
are enjoying the content that we're
putting out within these walls those are
all the questions I survived yeah I
think like I said Kyle can't make a
decision so all those favorite questions
you know yeah it gives me anxiety I'm so
indecisive this is why I like okay we'll
do another one of these in another two
years well guys thank you so much for
sending in those questions and for
