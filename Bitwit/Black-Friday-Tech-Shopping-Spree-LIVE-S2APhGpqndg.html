live now I think give YouTube a chance
to catch up hey there it is what's going
on guys how's it going hope you're
enjoying your your evening or afternoon
morning wherever the hell you are
I hope you're having a good day this is
just a super casual quick livestream and
also by the way hope you guys had a
great Thanksgiving yesterday I know I
ate way too much that's usually the mo
for these kinds of things
yo yo yo yeah lyle miles passed out he's
in a food coma we had a good we had to
go the powwow we had yet the last night
you guys should have been there
it was great only only had to call the
cops twice but hey is everything coming
in loud and clear no audio you are full
of it because this says I have tons of
audio right here on the monitor check it
one two yeah okay cool there's there's
probably trolls as well in chat saying
that everything's terrible but most
people say it's fine so yeah they're
there they're good damn you guys are
insane let's see I'm gonna give a couple
more seconds maybe just like a minute or
so for people to start rolling in
I've got about 1,200 people in right now
but yeah so let me just explain what
what the streams gonna be I kind of
thought it would be fun to just do a
casual PC part picking stream today so
basically I'm gonna target like $800 I
want to go for $800 it's um it's not
that much more than a console
considering like an Xbox one X is about
500 bucks without any deals so 300
ollars more yeah I mean that's that's
like three games right no no I'm sorry
not like I can't do math right now but
anyway $800 it seems like a pretty good
price point for a lot of builders who
are just getting into pcs or you know
don't want to spend $1000 plus but I'm
gonna I'm actually going to do one solid
I'm gonna do it one more solid and I'm
actually gonna try to do a build that
can handle 1440p gaming so
the other day I did a build with a with
the rx 590 the new card from AMD new
cart and that was that was close to a
thousand dollar build and that was
mainly a 1080p gaming system but I think
we can go even cheaper because it is
Black Friday and still get away with
being able to drive more pixels for the
gamers so it should be it should be cool
now that's weird that you're only having
oh you know what only left audio okay so
sorry headphone users I think I know why
I think its beak give me one sec you
might my audio might cut out first I
came products because I'm gonna try to
fix the settings here give me one moment
check check check one two
all right so it was you guys all right
it was in stereo so I just put some on
oh so now it should be coming in through
both ears I apologize to all the writers
out there I am NOT a racist and I treat
all ears equally alright so looks like
there's we've got a good amount of
people in here and no no I not too quiet
you're too quiet I can't hear you you're
in a chair that is actually fine because
I can do this and I can do this check
I'm trying also not to blow your guys's
ears out so let's see check one two
testing testing you got a live live
streaming doing all your troubleshooting
while you're already live in front of an
audience I hear you guys I hear you loud
and clear and I understand that you
cannot do the same to me right now
so here March our current yep yep yep
yep
the base properties
now here's the tricky part I'm gonna do
some microphone boobies oh let's go to
100 boom are you all deaf now can you
hear it is that better how does that
sound check one two
can you hear my singing for which 11
believe it yeah yeah yeah that's a bit
better but still a tad quiet okay now is
where I take it into overdrive and
enable mic boost and you all go deaf but
you asked for it you totally asked for
it so headphone users beware I'm going
to turn the microphone boost up just a
smidge right there okay check one two
ooh that looks like Kiki am i peaking
like crazy more that's a little better a
little better mic sounds good
check one two hey all right perfect
awesome that's crazy because in OBS it
says that I am clipping like a mofo so
it's just I care about your ears I
really do
ear care is the most important care but
yeah it's the first time that I'm
streaming on my own with this lovely
open microphone you guys also might not
recognize the background of this video
it's because I've actually had a family
member's house my mother-in-law was so
gracious enough to let me stream it from
her own house on Thanksgiving week so
round of applause to her and yeah I'm
gonna try to get through this stream
without stepping on too many toes here
so that the rest of the family can
continue their the relaxation time but
let's get started shall we
like I said for those of you just
they're just joining we're gonna do sort
of an $800 1440p gaming PC which would
be you'd be hard-pressed to get away
with that on any other day but Black
Friday but I think we can do it a little
bit easier now so I'm actually going to
switch it over to new eggs so we're
actually be working only with
today I have a good idea of the parts I
want to pick just sort of a general
foundation and weight change Mike using
the wrong Mike weight wrong Mike you're
using the wrong bike how many is in the
wrong Mike there's only one microphone
guys no there's none microphone built in
there all right hold on hold on give me
a sec let's switch back to full frame
audio let's see
default device check check one two
how does that sound oh is it the cam
light
let's see now it says mic plus phantom
now that all looks good yeah I sound
like I'm far away you shouldn't be I
mean it's it's definitely not selecting
the internal mic here well I'll give me
one sec guys buy microphone easy no
check-check can you guys hear me can you
hear me now
anybody check one two check testing one
two three
how's that sound loo no audio settings
let me double check audio settings in
OBS still no audio huh advanced audio
properties yeah we just tested the
stream before we're doing actually live
and it was fine so something must have
gotten switched over just talk to you
bolt check one two check check check
loud now good now check one two
how's that sound check one two good now
now you're rockin I can hear you loud
and clear
stop excellent
yeah it's always there's always a bit of
an adjustment period when streaming from
a new place I'm no streaming guru as you
guys are very well aware but fortunately
I have a very attentive cat who always
lets me know when I'm screwing up so
thank you guys it sounds like
everything's okay now I trust you guys
and we can move forward let's keep this
thing in the balls shall we so back to
our mo for today we're trying to build
an $800 gaming rig for 1440p gaming I
say we could even get some ultra wide
like 34 40 by 1440 in here with with the
amount of deals that are just oozing out
of websites like Amazon and Newegg this
morning so and as we all know like Black
Friday deals just tend to start earlier
and earlier in the month but I think
most of the best deals are reserved for
actually Black Friday so I think it's
still somewhat relevant to be streaming
today so let's just dive right in shall
we so they've got a huge you know new
got this huge Black Friday spread and
really the only thing we're interested
in here today anyway it is components so
looking at the components here let's see
I always like to start off with CPU
that's usually the first part that I
take out because that sort of dictates a
lot of the other parts that you're gonna
be using in the build so we've got you
know thankfully new eggs pretty well
organized it seems this year for sorting
out all their components and honestly if
we're gonna go $800 or less or even
$1000 all Australian we're really trying
to squeeze every ounce of performance
for our dollar
I'm gonna go Rison I feel like Rison is
just it's just the best way to do it
so someone's saying Mike boost
there's too much Mike loose all right so
what I'm gonna try to do is really quick
I'm gonna lower Mike boost and then up
the gain with yes you check one two
check one two how's that sound maybe
there should be a little bit less noise
now now that I kind of re recalibrated I
like how you guys can see exactly what
I'm doing I'm just coming to yes
all right so anyway let's go rising yeah
so those rise in 2700 for 249 which is a
damn good deal for sure but but I really
want to when you only have a limited
budget of $800 I really want to invest
more into the graphics card than the CPU
especially for gaming since most games
still are very much GPU dependent so I
think we can get away with like a risin
5 honestly and this this is a pretty
damn compelling offer from an AMD here's
a Verizon 5 1606 Core for 129 but it
also makes me wonder what Verizon 5 2600
goes for cuz if we can get the 2nd gen
option you get you get higher clock
speeds out of the box
better overclocking abilities and it
looks like we have a 2600 for only 20
bucks more I think that's I think that's
worth it I think we're gonna go with the
2600 guys
this seems to be one of the more bang
for the buck options at the moment so
let's add this no I don't want to three
your protection plan go to hell and we
are moving up to the motherboard the
motherboards also one of the first
things because once you know your c4 you
you know what socket you want and also
if you know if you have an overclocking
chip how beefy you want your vom to be
if you want you know if you're gonna
need an overclocking chipset in the
first place so let's go back to the
Black Friday deals here and actually I
was right here and lockdown a
motherboard AM foe hey and boy hold on
hold on here huh so if you go to the
Black Friday deals just broadly and you
choose motherboards okay it's because I
selected a and B motherboards I was
thinking that they didn't have any deals
on any Intel board but that's clearly
not the case
alright so a m4 here we go I don't want
to spend more than 70 bucks on a board
alright we're not trying to break any
world world records here overclocking so
we don't need anything super crazy but I
also like sorting by lowest price
because I'm a cheap bastard and look at
this gigabytes a $49 board down from 65
it's got USB 3.1 2 by 16 slots that's
kind of cool even though I probably
would never use those the only thing
that concerns me here is that this is
probably not a great overclocker because
if you just look at the vrm setup I mean
there's like virtually zero heatsink
heatsink treatment there so maybe maybe
I'll back out of that this would be good
if it was like a budget board if you
were going to look rising three or
something like that but I think we can
get away with a little bit more now
asrock I've had I've had as rock UAF
eyes have been hidden hit or miss for me
so I try to avoid those when I can it's
not to say that they haven't been
perfectly fine I mean my daily is a is
an x3 99 Taichi
nothing kicks ass but alright be 350
gaming Pro also a little bit light with
the vrm setup here I've seen the ACS
boards for a relatively little now this
this is a little bit more than I'd like
to spend this is this is probably a much
better overclocking board than the other
ones we've taking a look at but again
we're really trying to grind here for
for getting under $800 this was okay
74 you know what this one doesn't look
too bad actually
this ms I'd be 350 PC mate then again
you kind of want if you have the option
to you'd want to be 450 motherboard you
want that chipset to go along with the
resin to second generation that I see
any p450 boards
this is actually pretty solid
I like this board because well first
it's all black it's gonna match
everything it's let's kind of beside a
side bonus the power delivery looks
pretty pretty robust compared to the
other options and it's got four dimm
slots what is this full ATX board look
at all the look at all the features look
at all the features of course we've got
MDOT two on here I don't think we're
gonna be populating this system with an
MDOT to drive just because you can save
money with two and a half inch still but
this looks like a relatively good option
for 75 bucks I like the fact that it's
loud as I'm about to just for
expandability in the future of great
ability so we're gonna add this to cart
and we can always rework this guys we
don't have to like none of these parts
are set in stone if like we're way over
budget or something like that we can
always go back to the drawing board
no stop giving me the 3-year protection
plans on every single part new egg I
don't I don't appreciate it all right
next up what can we do next
next we'll probably do memory I think
memory is is the next logical step here
now rise in very much favors fast memory
frequency mainly because of the Infinity
fabric and how that interconnects a lot
of the lot of the almonds together on
the architecture memory controller and
so forth so if you if you increase the
RAM frequency a lot of other elements
get sped up in the process so we're
gonna see what kind of deals we can find
on ddr4 ddr4 is gonna be one of the
hottest sellers I think in the PC space
this Black Friday because memories just
been so expensive lately it has gone
down quite a bit you know a month or two
before Black Friday even but now is the
time strike when the iron's hot guys you
can find some really good deals on 16
gig kits
relatively easily especially today so
I'm gonna go okay let's again sort by
lowest lowest price and this is all this
is all either ddr3 or no okay so there's
a 16 gig racket now again I wanted fast
memory which for me Verizon I usually
recommend 3,000 mega Hertz or 3,000 mega
transfers and up of course you could get
away with like a slightly slower kit and
then overclock your memory but just to
ensure full compatibility that it's
going to run at that operating speed
that's listed on the box I tend to go
with 3,000 or higher so these are all
cheaper kits around 21 33 2400 speed and
see all the speeds here there's a 3,000
kit right here to buy to buy eight gigs
that's actually not bad
Gayle I will forever not know how to
pronounce this scale G oh I'm just gonna
stop trying but I don't know let's see
what else we have here
you skip up just five that's 2400 3000
right here as well for the T force
that's actually not bad
I could I could dig it you we've also
got no that's 2666 let's let's check out
this T for spring I've been pretty happy
with the P force memory lately I've been
using it more and more some other
nighthawk RGB modules actually were
responding really well on Reisen last I
checked and this sale ends in 12 hours
so I feel like I'm feeling the pressure
I feel people here peer pressured into
getting this this is the cheapest
probably the most reliable kit that we
can find on your leg right now at 3000
speed so I'm adding it again don't freak
out guys we can always go back and OH
dial okay pronounced like hi oh then I
should immediately know how that's
pronounced so that that's the easiest
Wow it's it's personal now I'll never
forget how to pronounce dial ever again
watch
I will all right so we've got the big
three down I would say the big three out
of four we could go for a graphics card
next because that's that's gonna be the
we're gonna allocate the most of our
budget to the GPU for sure as well you
should if you're building a gaming PC if
you're building a rendering system then
allocate more towards the CPU and memory
but let's let's see what kind of video
card deals we've got today 86 options to
choose from now then I want to also sort
by lowest price once again and let's see
obviously you can get some pretty smokin
deals on rx 570s for a buck 39 holy moly
it's not terrible I want something more
substantial though because like I
mentioned we're trying to go 1440p this
time around and any of the RX cards
unless you're talking about RX vega 56
and higher are really just not gonna cut
it they're not gonna give you the best
the richest experience at that
resolution so I want to go with either
Vega 56 rx big a 56 would be pretty
sweet and you find a good deal on that
or a gtx 1070 from nvidia and so far I
think we need a scrub we're not gonna
get something for less than 300 here so
okay so what is this this isn't this is
GT x10 60s and then once we break the
the 300 Wow
three hundred and twenty-five dollars
for this mini GTX 1060 down from oh but
it's down from $700 so it's a smoking
deal I don't know what the hell's going
on there in the Reg but okay we've got a
geforce gtx 10:17 duel from asus asus is
a reputable
added board partner as you all know and
you get monster hunter for free Hey
bonus bonus value-add there there's also
a Vega an RX Vega 56 for the same price
but it's a blur style it's its reference
card design and
I think that's poop pure food look at
this 1070 ti4 349 but honestly you just
buy 1070 and overclock it in most cases
and get pretty close to a 1070 TI anyway
and plus it would save us o $10 I don't
know man
I don't know it's that's that's kind of
tempting it's only ten bucks more for
1070 TI alright you know we're gonna do
we're gonna do some we're gonna do some
check interaction here alright which one
did I go for do I go for gtx 1070 or gtx
1070 TI or $10 more alright great poll
and I'm gonna put the poll in check you
guys answer welcome back to that in just
a bit all right let's move on though I'm
gonna open up a new tab here so we don't
lose our space lose our place and we can
move on to what's what's next let's do
it let's do case case sounds exciting
cases are always fun to shop for and it
looks like we have a lot of options here
what are the what are the odds that the
what are the odds at the very first case
here that they've listed is the one that
I'm most attracted to the Eclipse P 300
from fantex is such a steal it's such a
steal at at its base MSRP of 60 bucks
and now they're selling it for $10 less
I mean it's really the full package for
an entry-level case entry-level cases
the entry-level case markets become so
competitive and fan takes really stepped
up their game in this space
you've got tempered glass there's some
RGB element if you're into that the
front panel looks fairly closed off but
when you take a look at this case in
person you realize how far away that
from the edge of that front panel is
from the actual fans inside on that
wrist behind the frame and there's some
ample ventilation openings on the top
and bottom you get a power supply shroud
I mean this is the entry one of the best
entry cases entry level cases for 2018
even though I think it released last
year I think I remember yeah and you got
dust filtration in the front as well oh
it's tempting it's so tempting I like
this case a lot and if you look at the
other options I've granted these two
right here are 10 bucks cheaper but I
mean look it just there's no power
supply shroud I believe this is yeah
it's an acrylic side panel this master
box and I don't know this this carbide
serie is just like super choked for
airflow and then it goes up immediately
you've got a mesh if I see which is
totally different category it's mesh
pricing is great too
but twice as expensive as those other
cases so you know what I'm just gonna
I'm gonna trust my gut and go with p300
yo that's what I'm doing alright let's
see what you guys voted on right yeah
I'm gonna bring this up into the screen
so you can see look at the results 1070
TI for $10 more 93% of you as I
suspected are imploring me to go with
that option and I think you guys have
chosen correctly that's what I'm gonna
do so let's go down to that from zou tag
so Tech's also a very very good admin
board partner that I use a lot so there
it is we are now at whoo we are
dangerously close to $800 her--they guys
we need to leave the curb are spending a
little bit at 740 for this is it's
getting tight but again if we go a
little over budget I'm not gonna freak
out and again we can always rework the
parts if you want to um so let's go to
our next item which I will say storage
in steam it's good Neal storage out of
the way for this I'm just gonna type in
256 gig SSD sort by lowest price
and you could if you wanted to you could
spend pennies on like a no-name brand
like like whatever this is what is this
dogfish don't they make beer it even has
a similar logo I mean I don't it's
definitely not the same brand but yeah
it's some Chinese brand but well that's
like I'm a little skeptical but this is
where I draw the line on SSDs like if
it's a brand I've just never heard of
and it's way too cheap to be to be you
know it's way too good to be true type
of thing
I mean 26 bucks and this is only 128
gigs so that's something even a crazy
deal now something like this silicon
power I've used their products
extensively in the past they've never
let me down and you get 256 gigs here 35
bucks it's only $10 more than that in
the dogfish option so let's see what
else is here it might not get much
better than that guys it may not get
much better than that
so a Davis got one but it's five bucks
more a did is also a great brand for
cheaper SSDs and then yeah and then they
just get more expensive from there I'm
going silicon power I've used this exact
SSD and I build in the past so
happy to bring it back here Oh Paul is
now screaming cool you guys should all
go show Paul some love to maybe um I
don't know I think a dual stream if
you're if your ears can be listening
independent of each other then I suggest
you watch both of our screens
simultaneously but at any rate tell him
tell him I say hi
everyone go crash a stream and tell him
I said little uh tell him to buy all the
things and into and - you know if he
wants to buy me something that would
that be nice I'm not gonna complain all
right so SSD SSD in the bag for 35 bucks
feeling strong about that does Paul not
have I'm gonna text Paul really quick
he doesn't have sound Paul you have no
sound you have no sound and then I'm
gonna say that'll be the quote I said
you have no sound in quotes and then
your chat 2018
you have no sound your chat 20 I'm sure
he'll get to get it together eventually
I mean I did I mean I probably had a way
bigger tech issues than he is right now
at the beginning of this stream so let's
move on though
to storage I like two terabytes I think
that's a happy medium it gives you
enough for all your games most your
games depending on how extensive of the
library you have in with just games just
getting larger and larger by the day it
is you can't get away with the one
terabyte drive anymore even if you're a
casual gamer I mean these games are like
100 gigs plus now it's it's ridiculous
so let's do two terabyte and see what
what comes up
again Newegg seems to know what I'm
after right now because we have a $60 or
Seagate Barracuda 2 terabyte 72 or 7200
rpm now I understand that a lot of
people do not like Seagate and they've
had really bad experiences with them I
have honestly had nothing but great
experiences a 2 terabyte Barracuda was
my first hard drive ever that I bought
back in 2012 and it's still going strong
granted I'm not using it daily but it's
it's just it's it's good it's just as
reliable as any of the other drives that
I've owned so I never I can't I can't
not recommend it to people when I've had
personally a great experience with them
and for 60 bucks I mean it's it's
definitely stuffing a lot cheaper them 2
WD options WD black is a little you know
that's that's when you're doing it you
know you've got the dough you got the
extra cash flow for a black then you go
black once you go black you never go
back
as they say it applies to the hard
drives too you know speaking from
personal experience there is a blue
somewhere okay that maybe blue isn't
even popping up interesting interesting
okay so oh oh here it is so there is a
WD blue option for the same price as
that Barracuda but it's 5400 rpm which I
know not gonna happen
hard drives are slow enough after you
know using SSDs for so long I I'm not
gonna deal with a 5400 rpm drive and
then the that means the 7200 rpm drive
from you know the WD blue is probably
gonna be quite a bit more maybe 10 20
bucks more I'm fine with the Barracuda
though so let's do that why can't I add
it why can't I add it to cart straight
from here I don't understand why do I
have to click on the product page
there's stupid and it's got fairly good
reviews too you know four out of five
eggs
let's take four eggs adding that
no thanks don't need a protection plan
and let's see the last thing we have
here is a power supply
let's do power supply here and we are we
are over budget at this point eight
hundred and forty bucks let's see what
the the power supply gods have in store
for us let's take one gander here I'll
try to rework some of this stuff for you
guys oh yeah 80 plus bronze partially
modular and 500 to 550 watts those are
those are the bare minimum features that
I'm looking for right now and if we sort
my lowest price okay this this scares me
a twenty dollar power supply EVGA Br
it's good from it doesn't have many
reviews but all the reviews are positive
VR is that stands for for brick the 500
BR it guaranteed to brick your computer
in the first six minutes I don't know
man what does a 600 watt go for 50 bucks
okay that's quite a bit more I mean this
is a if it's just a it's a budget PC it
doesn't get much better than this man I
mean it's granted it's not modular but
the cables are black the kit that's the
one thing the great thing that EVGA does
is pretty much all their power supplies
now even the budget ones are all black
no ketchup and mustard so praise whoever
at EVGA came up with that 80 plus bronze
is also not not much to scoff at and
we're already over budget guys so I feel
like I feel like I feel like the only
reservation I have is that it I always
have this policy of never skimping on
your power supply even even on day like
Black Friday when you're trying
get the most bang for your box so let's
see what else we have here be quiet pure
power 10 500 500 watts that's actually
not terrible either not modular though
whatsoever and then we have supernova
550 so you get an additional 50 watts
that can come in handy especially if
you're playing to overclock the system
and it's fully modular with 80 plus gold
80 plus gold hey hey oh and the g3
series is something I tend to standby
use these units so much in the past
dang dude what does this originally go
for ninety nine dollars down from a
hundred bucks now granted even without
Black Friday you could probably find it
for 50 60 bucks but this is actually a
really good deal and I'm probably gonna
have to add it no thanks
no powers no a protection plan so we are
now eighty dollars over budget or eighty
bucks over budget which is actually not
terrible when you think about the kind
of performance you'll be getting out of
a rising five 2606 core cpu and a gtx
1070 aftermarket card non-reference
you're gonna be able to overclock you're
gonna be able to do streaming and stream
wall gaming video editing pretty much
the the world is at your fingertips with
this with this parts list and i'm fairly
happy with what we've managed to
scrounge together in just a half an hour
or so now if you wanted to cut this down
we're not going to go hunting too deep
for for alternate parts but if you
wanted to cut this down there there are
some ways that you could shave down the
corners here the case is always it can
be flexible you can find cases for 25 35
bucks so if you want to save fifteen
dollars there you could go with
something that doesn't have all the
bells and whistles that the P 300 does
again
I love this case and I stand by my
decision here but again if you're trying
to hit that that price point it's 800
flat then you can get a you know shave
down your case a little bit additionally
you could you could probably get a
cheaper motherboard if you weren't so
hot on overclocking let's say you only
wanted to overclock to three hundred
megahertz at most or even like a hundred
or two hundred and or you were over
clocking it all yours happy with out of
the box you don't want to risk anything
even though the risk of overclocking is
very low these days you could get a
motherboard as we saw for forty nine
dollars and that would save you an
additional twenty so if you're saving
$15 on the case $20 on the motherboard
that's 35 yes I went to math school so
that's already nailed down 35 bucks from
our 80 and so we've only got you know 45
left to shave off here you could have
saved an additional $10 on that gtx 1070
TI by going with the 1070 still an
amazing card for 1440p gaming that
brings us down to $35 over budget if you
wanted to risk getting that $20 that $20
psu which was also from EVGA the the 500
watt Br
you could shave that down to you could
probably save five bucks on memory going
with a slightly slower kit and and
that's pretty much all I would skimp on
and that would bring you down to eight
hundred so you would be cutting some
corners you wouldn't have you know some
people would be okay would you perfectly
fine making those sacrifices and others
wouldn't it really boils down to your
needs your your and your and your budget
you know how how tightly do you want to
swing this so that's pretty much it guys
but I've had helpers along the way
create links for all the parts that we
use today and I will put them in my
video description right freaking me out
well we have 53 hundred of you watching
right now so thank you everyone who's
tuned in i I really do appreciate you
guys support on this holiday week
and the links are all in there so feel
free to use them just this disclaimer I
do get a small kickback for anything
that you purchase through those links in
case that you know doesn't sound stand
morally right with you or something like
that but it does help support the
channel and and helps me continue doing
what I'm doing so thank you guys so much
that's gonna conclude it for now I've
got family here and a bunch of other
things going on today so I'm gonna get
out of your hair thanks for tuning in
guys love y'all and see you next time
