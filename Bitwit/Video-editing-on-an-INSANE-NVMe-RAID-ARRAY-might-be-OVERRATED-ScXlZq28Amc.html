below what's going on guys welcome back
to the channel hope you're all doing
well so a few months back I assembled
the enthu elite build which was this
crazy over-the-top twelve thousand
dollar custom water-cooled behemoth of a
system that could handle pretty much
anything you threw at it and today we're
gonna be talking specifically about that
systems storage configuration and what
my experiences has been like while video
editing on it because a lot of you guys
been asking me over the last few months
ever since I announced that I would be
using that system as my daily driver for
video editing here at the office so
that's what we're gonna explore more of
today now for those of you unaware this
is no ordinary storage setup while we
are booting off of a simple 250 gig 960
Evo nvme m2 SSD with our Adobe Creative
Cloud software loaded up onto it as well
the other disk that we're using to store
all the footage will be editing with is
a four terabyte 960 pro nvme raid 0
array the theoretical throughput on this
set up is astronomically fast it's it's
bonkers but at the same time it doesn't
represent the kind of real-world
performance you might expect to see
inside of an application like Adobe
Premiere Pro so today I thought it would
be kind of interesting to compare this
over the top config to a bunch of other
common alternatives like a simple
mechanical hard drive a SATA based SSD
and even a single nvme SSD to sort of
see how they all stack up hopefully by
the end of this video we'll be able to
tell if these super-high crazy
theoretical numbers actually do us any
favors inside of a professional video
editing workflow but before we get
started with some of the testing let's
quickly go over the specs of this system
which is just an absolute beast
for starters we've got the I 9 79 80 X
II overclocked to 4.1 gigahertz on all
18 cores and 36 threads that was deleted
and
fresh application of liquid metal from
the folks over at gamers Nexus so shout
out to those guys an Asus Rampage six
extreme motherboard with 128 gigs of
g.skill Trident Z RGB ddr4 at 3200 speed
2 asus strix
OC GTX 10 ATT is an SLI that are being
water cooled by a custom loop that I
made that's also water cooling the CPU
mind you once again our boot drive is a
250 gig samsung 960 Evo and our editing
disk is comprised of 2 2 terabyte 960
pros in raid 0 this is all being powered
by a 1200 watt power supply from enter
max as I mentioned Adobe Premiere Pro is
loaded up on to our C Drive that's that
960 Evo and our media cache is currently
going to our editing disk that 4
terabyte nvme raid array and this is
gonna be emulated for all of the other
disk tests so for example when we're
testing out our mechanical hard drive
I'm gonna have the media cache going to
that as well so with that said let's
talk about the experience we had when
ingesting or capturing footage which is
a very important step of the whole video
editing workflow regardless of what kind
of editor you are what software you use
or your style or technique every editor
has to at one point or another capture
the footage from their cameras removable
media over to their computer and the
faster you're able to do that the more
time you have for editing the sooner you
can get into it so the sample footage
that we're using for this test was
provided by Chris and he often works
with red cameras in fact the footage
here was shot on a red dragon at 6k
resolution at 24 fps or 23.976 to be
exact but he gave me eight files to deal
with which adds up to be about 22
gigabytes so starting with our hard
drive with an old magnetic platter we
were able to transfer this batch of
files in about a minute and 47 seconds
or a hundred and seven seconds total
and that was at about 68 megabytes per
second which is pretty typical of a
mechanical hard drive in case you were
curious we're using a 2 terabyte Hitachi
7200 RPM drive our one terabyte HyperX
savage SATA based SSD did a whole lot
better and was able to transfer the
files in a minute in 14 seconds or 74
seconds and that was at a transfer rate
of 300 megabytes per second now before
you get too excited about how the
via me or nvme raid performed in this
test remember that we're still being
limited by the USB 3.0 interface which
is what we're using to transfer all of
these files through from the cameras
media to our computers so whether you're
going SATA or nvme you won't really see
much difference in ingest times due to
the transfer speed limitations of USB 3
as it turns out the only real
performance jump you see in this test is
when switching from a mechanical hard
drive to an SSD whether it be SATA or
nvme our next round of tests involve
editing and scrubbing through the actual
footage inside a Premiere Pro and the
files that Chris provided us are
actually clips of him we can see his
face we can see him run around on camera
he's actually testing the lighting for
whatever project he was working on but
it's good for us the fact that there's
constant motion or movement on camera
means that we can easily spot when a
drive is having trouble when it stutters
when it's choppy it's gonna be very
apparent on camera whenever it's
happening so it'll allow us to sort of
give a better representation of how each
of these drives perform I should also
mention before we get into it that all
of these tests are initially run at full
100% playback resolutions so in the
program monitor in Adobe Premiere Pro
that is being played back at full 6k
resolution until or unless I specify
otherwise so just bear that in mind
so our hard drive was able to play back
the 6k footage at full resolution at 1x
no problem at real-time speed it was
perfectly fine no hiccups here but as
soon as we go to 2x or 4x things start
to get a little bit choppy just every
couple seconds there's a there's a
little stutter there's maybe a dropped
frame or so which kind of pulls us out
of the experience it's still very usable
but a little bit distracting to say the
least it's not until we get to 8x speed
when we just go full choppiness and we
can no longer really work at this level
of performance it's just it's just too
much of a drag we actually had to lower
the resolution down to 1/8 1/8
resolution in order to play 8x speed
fluidly and even beautiful 6k red
footage at eighth resolution doesn't
look so great so that's not really an
ideal situation that any video editor
wants to be in I also tested the drives
to see how they would playback
time-lapse footage so basically I took
the sample footage that Chris gave me
and I sped it all up at 5,000 X
and basically just tried to play it to
see if it would if it would run and sure
enough the hard drive was choppy AF so
we really couldn't tell what was going
on when playing it back at that
ludicrous speed our SATA based HyperX
savage SSD performed a lot better here
and was able to play back all the
footage at full resolution very smoothly
up until 32x speed where we saw some
choppiness for the first five to ten
seconds after that it eventually sort of
caught up with itself and became smooth
again
fortunately we passed the time-lapse
test with flying colors and were able to
play back the 5000 speed footage at full
resolution very very smoothly
so that was very impressive next we had
our single nvme drive which performs
pretty much on par with our SATA based
SSD saw little to no hiccups all the way
up to 32x speed when it became a little
bit choppy for the first few seconds
then it eventually evened out and became
super smooth and the time-lapse playback
at full resolution 5000 speed worked
like a charm as well
finally our nvme raid array was an
absolute animal with virtually no signs
of slow down or stuttering in sight I
mean the thing just chewed through 32 X
speed like like it was butter and that
goes double for the time-lapse footage
playing back at full resolution but if
I'm being perfectly honest the
experience I had on the SATA based SSD
was one perfectly adequate in my opinion
and to not that far off from what the
nvme raid array was able to achieve and
when you consider the price difference
between the two the SATA SSD is clearly
the better value for 99.9% of users
except that point one percent who can
actually leverage the full potential of
an nvme raid array the last round of
tests revolve around rendering because
it's an important step of the video
editing process and I figure a lot of
you guys might be curious to hear
whether or not your storage solution has
any impact on rendering times the short
answer is no as we're about to look at
the data here whether we were rendering
out with our hard drive with all the
footage and and also being the target
drive for our render our rendered file
being a hard drive versus the nvme raid
array we still rendered the same
ten minute file in ten minutes and 50
seconds there is virtually no difference
regardless of what drive we were
rendering to or where the files were
stored so that just goes to show and
sort of a reminder that rendering really
relies on a couple things your CPU your
memory and your GPU if you're enabling
some sort of GPU acceleration which I
was for this particular test but if
you're looking to cut down your encoding
times then upgrading your storage
solution is not really the first place
you want to look you want to look at
those other areas for me what this all
boils down to is that you don't really
need to spend an arm and a leg on a
crazy fancy nvme raid array if you want
to edit some 4k or even 6k footage on a
prosumer level which is kind of a bummer
for me because I really wish I could
utilize all of this raw horsepower that
I have but it really doesn't make too
much of a difference when it comes to
editing at the same time it's good news
for someone who doesn't have twenty five
hundred dollars to spend on a setup like
that but still wants to have a super
smooth editing experience and for those
users I would suggest a SATA SSD if you
can afford it
get a single nvme SSD you'll get
slightly better transfer speeds when
you're moving files around things like
that but for the most part a SATA based
SSD is still gonna be perfectly fine for
most editors meets especially if you're
just on the consumer or prosumer level
of course once you get into like you
know the really really
professional-grade stuff then things are
a little bit different there but for the
most part the SATA SSD still works just
fine for video editing if you guys have
any experiences of your own please feel
free to share them with the class what
kind of system that you're editing on
what drives you're using and things like
that we'd love to hear all about it down
below but that's pretty much gonna do it
