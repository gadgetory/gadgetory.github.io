channel hope you're all doing fantastic
today we are doing something a little
quick and dirty but it should be kind of
fun
essentially my cousin the good cousin of
mine I'm actually my wife's first cousin
so technically my cousin in law is in
need of a new gaming PC so he approached
me recently and asked if I could help
him out and I said sure of course so I
was just going to do this on the side
without filming anything for the channel
and I decided now you know it'd be kind
of cool if I parted out the list in
front of you guys brought you along for
the ride so that maybe you can provide
some feedback of your own and we can
sort of together assemble the perfect
rig for his needs so this is part one of
the little mini series so we're just
going to be parting out a parts list
essentially for him today and then we're
going to do a follow-up video hopefully
with all the parts and then we're going
to assemble it for him right here on the
channel so on that note Brandon's kind
of looking for a sort of a mid-range to
high-end sort of on the high-end scope
of a gaming PC he's looking to play like
things like rocket League csgo and a
couple indie games like Binding of Isaac
and while these are not very taxing
games at all I kind of want to prepare
him for several years down the line I
don't want to just give him the bare
minimum so and especially given his
budget which is around a thousand to
three hundred thousand of thirteen
hundred dollars with the potential to go
even beyond that up to fifteen hundred I
believe he said if it's if the value is
going to pay off I think we can do a lot
more than just run those few games and
he is sort of interested in showing some
interest in potentially playing you know
other games in the future obviously if
he does want to jump in to the foray of
Triple A games that are out there right
now then I want him to be equipped for
that so I'm not going to skim too much
I'm really going to try to maximize his
budget also he doesn't really have a
monitor right now I think he said that
he's going to wait to see what kind of
specs that the computer has and then
he'll sort of base his resolution off of
what the system can handle which i think
makes a lot of sense he's not too
familiar with overclocking and he was
kind of a little skeptical at first
saying like well does it you know
shorten the lifespan of your of your
components and while it can with really
aggressive overclocks you know if you're
sustaining the same high voltage 24/7
that way then yeah it can be harmful but
I'm planning to overclock his system
myself with more like moderate overclock
I don't want to go too aggressive on it
so I think we're going to squeeze a
little bit extra performance out of his
system without really any of the
negative drawbacks with overclocking so
that should be good now the other thing
that he mentioned in terms of just the
overall style that he'd like his system
to be he did say that he would prefer a
white cakes or he really likes the
aesthetic of white chassis so I'm going
to bear that in mind for as we go about
picking out the parts and as far as LEDs
he says they're more or less optional
we'll see what we can do and if we have
any extra expense or any extra wiggle
room once we've picked out all the more
important parts so on that notes we can
just go ahead and dive into the the
desktop here we're going to be using two
websites here Newegg for all of the
browsing we're going to be window
shopping with Newegg because they have a
really powerful search feature and we're
going to be plugging that into PC part
picker to see what kind of deals we can
score on said components so starting
with the case heard let's just type in
white case here the search on Newegg see
what comes up here now for $1,300 13 to
$1,500 you really can get a really nice
case for that sort of money but the
cases these days have also become
increasingly more competitive and you
can get a really good case these days
for around 100 bucks sometimes even less
so I'm going to bear that in mind I want
to go to all-out on the chassis here but
I was I was I am this actually had this
in the back of my mind the s340 elite
which is a in matte whites got a really
nice tempered glass side panel I did my
RGB build in December in that chassis so
that's that's a consideration the
Eclipse P 400 from fan text is also a
fantastic case it's what I used for a
system config about a year ago or so and
then we've also got the H 440 a
tried-and-true classic of course and
inland 303 oh yeah that's a pretty nice
case I don't know I feel I feel a little
bit conflicted with the the 303 not so
hot on the feet the feet look kind of
silly to me look that my wife said that
they look like duck feet and now I can't
unsee it so and then there's just a
bunch of other some other cases that are
a little bit older but I'm going to say
tentatively right now let's go for the
s3 40 elites in that and of course I'm
going to be sending this parts list to
brandy
after it's all done and he's going to
look it over and either give his
approval we might tweak it so by no
means is this like set in stone here
this is all subject to change so we're
going to go ahead and plug that in
choose a case there it is so you can get
it on for 90 bucks at the super biz
that's cool all right let's move on to
our CPU now this is kind of could be a
little bit interesting because of course
now we have a bunch more options now
with Verizon now available so but
because he's not doing any sort of like
live streaming or video editing the most
he said in terms of like workstation
stuff is maybe some photoshop some like
photoshop which is really nothing a you
know a four core intel kb lake chip
cannot handle so I think if just for
pure gaming performance and getting the
most bang for our buck here just in
terms of frames I'm going to go for the
7600 K let's see how much it is on new
egg here 240 bucks see if we can get
that down even lower the 7600 K
obviously is overclockable so we can
squeeze additional performance out of it
it does outperform the the current stack
of like Verizon 5 CPUs you can take it
quite far if you have a nice cooler on
it which I plan to put in this build as
well so 7600 K we've got one right here
for 230 bucks this also superb is no
that's Amazon beautiful okay now let's
take a look at motherboards of course
we're going to want a z2 70 board so
that we can overclock our chip maybe I
should just do I love how I said new
eggs great for its power search feature
and I'm not using it at all you're just
typing in randomly you know I want
to I want to hook them up with an Asus
board because I personally like the UEFI
with Asus the most I find it the most
reliable and it's like the least finicky
so just in case he's got to troubleshoot
something and I'm not there to help them
obviously it won't be won't be too bad
we let's see we've got here let's street
sort this by lowest price if you don't
need anything crazy he's not going to
have a whole lot of he's not going to
need too much connectivity this prime ok
160 bucks for the ACS prime Z 217 which
is a white board which would match with
the case this is nice our ROG Strix to
the Z - 7 th I look at that PCB
holy moly looks pretty wicked
this is this is good I'm going to say
170 bucks that's reasonable for for a
gaming rig of this particular price
point so I'm going to go ahead and see
what we can get so you can shave that
down z - 7 th here it is for 155 I'll
take it
let's do a CPU cooler now let's see okay
obviously I want to look nice and it
should sort of match with the overall
theme I think that's motherboard sort of
provides a base of that and let's just
look at CPU coolers you know I built
with a be quiet dark rock 3 recently and
I still love that cooler till this day
75 bucks 65 bucks yes I'm doing it ok
this is a supports LGA 1151 it's all
black it looks fantastic
it's super quiet and it performs well so
this is kind of a no-brainer for me next
step let's do some RAM let's do the Rams
RAM ddr4 oh no I said RAM let's do
mammary memory ddr4 will do 16 gigs it's
sort of the sweet spot for most gamers
these days most games don't maximize
that now I can also overclock his memory
for him as well so we don't necessarily
need a super-fast kit this is only 120
for $225 and it is 3200 I'm going to go
with the riptides 5 here that looks
pretty good for 125 bucks g.skill really
does have some good deals on memory
right now especially with the the price
hike in ddr4 it's kind of insane but
let's see if we can find it even cheaper
here force ddr4 of C g.skill ripjaws v
3200 that turns up nothing because I
forgot the period in G scale yes it is
alright it is period sensitive
let's see 3200 this is a 2 by 16 gig kit
of ddr4 for 120 dollars yes so ok we're
looking good we're in good shape right
now so let's do storage really quick or
now let's do the graphics card first so
for a rig of his budget I would say GTX
seven D like a good 1070 you could go a
1080 that would be almost that would be
more than a third of the cost of the rig
and I feel like we'd probably have to
cut a few corners to make that happen
and especially with the games that he's
playing right now or that he plans to
play he doesn't really need a gtx 1080
as good a value as it is I think the GTX
and somebody still provides the overall
better frames per dollar or value so
let's see GTX 10 70s what do we got here
I kind of already have my eye on asus
strix
depending on the price 420 so it's about
in line with like the EVGA ACX 3.0 card
there are cheaper GTX 10 70s no doubt
like there's the zotac gtx 770 mini for
360 bucks that is quite a bit cheaper 40
50 $60 off but it doesn't look as cool
it doesn't look nearly as badass as the
Strix so this is and it also performs
excellently just really really well
received cooler all around from multiple
tech review sites okay so no price
discount on the PC part picker for a
hundred four hundred and twenty dollars
here let's see what's the difference
here
Oh one's the OSI model okay well the OSI
model looks like it's about the same
price so I'm just gonna add that let's
look at power supplies I think if 650
watt sounds great not too much not too
little offers some additional Headroom
for overclocking there is this one
supernova g2 for 90 bucks let's just get
him a Lodge assist let's turn this
$40.00
Lodge assists and then his whole
computer will just melt see Sonic oh
that's $150 I really do like see sonic
power supplies this one the SSR 650 RM
is $80 which is $10 cheaper than the
EVGA supernova 650 see Sonic's a great
brand they make some really good power
supplies and it's Johnny guru comm
recommended nine point eight out of ten
okay let's let's see what we can do here
see sonic here we go for $77 okay yeah
and I think that just leaves storage so
start off with an SSD he's going to need
one of those to boot off of maybe store
some applications
he doesn't need nvme honestly that's a
little overkill for what he would
use it for Samsung 850 Evo I mean it's
it works it's fast and it's a pretty
decent dollar per gig there is the
crucial MX 300 525 good capacity is kind
of interesting or 275 huh
275 gigs compared to 250 gigs on the 850
Evo the agency Evo is a little bit
faster but I don't know you get an
additional 25 gigs whatever on this
Drive and it's $10 cheaper I'm gonna
pick this one just just for now if you
guys think let me know in the comments
with you but your opinions are on the
matter or if you have a third a third
candidate in mind okay that's good and
then we'll just do for storage let's do
for a hard drive one terabyte WD black I
doubt he'll be needing more than that he
can always add more storage in the
future if he needs done okay
oh you know what that see sonic power
supply let's go back to that it has ugly
cables here they are Oh God oh they're
hideous oh no we can't do that that is a
no-go oh boy
the whoo-hoo so here's what we could do
we could spend a little bit more on a
power supply of the same wattage like
the supernova 650 g2 that has black
cables okay or we could just buy an
extension kit just like a pure simple
black extension kit to hide to mask all
the sea Sonic cables those ketchup and
mustard bastards
so it's $30 for the spandex kit that's
around what I was expecting it to be
then again these do look a bit nicer
even than the EVGA stock cables right
because they're kind of fabric II and
nice and sleepy let's let's just just
let's just do these at accessories at a
custom part perfect and updates with the
price okay I think the part list is
complete are we missing anything did we
get check all the boxes OLEDs LEDs I
mean man how much how much does a NZXT
hue plus go for these days $60 yeah
that's a little bit much for
some LEDs at least four for Brandon to
need because that wasn't really on his
is like must-have list so maybe we'll
just go with something like let's just
factor in fifteen to twenty dollars
maybe fifteen dollars for an LED strip
it should we get to that point and
granted there are already LEDs on the
video card and I believe on the
motherboard so there is going to be a
bit of bling shining through that
tempered glass panel on the s340 elite
so let's see what our total cost comes
out to with all these parts added
drumroll please
thirteen hundred and forty nine dollars
that is right within our price range
obviously it's a bit on the high end of
what what what Brandon's budget is but
for now I think this is a pretty solid
list but you guys let me know what you
think of the parts list so far if you
think it's awful
if you think some of it works but could
be improved why is this g.skill kit red
what the hell that all right so the RAM
kits been updated to black we spelled
the same price at the end of the day and
we what the hell why is there why is it
freaking SSD I'm done - ah good lord I
should not be allowed to part out people
systems let's take a look at this really
really quick MX 300 M - it's not as $100
$100 here but the two and a half inch
drive was what also $100 okay I don't
know it might look kind of ugly it's not
it's not the prettiest m to drive it's a
little nasty little nasty is there let's
take a look the motherboard really quick
to see if there's a got to cover on it
no there's not all right so I'm thinking
just based on cosmetics alone I'm going
to opt for the two-and-a-half inch model
of the MX 300 because it won't look like
crap so there's our new total price at
thirteen hundred and fifty four dollars
and sixty-five cents again this is using
PC part picker great websites everyone
should go check it out if you haven't
heard of it but that is going to
conclude this parts list for Brandon's
new gaming PC altogether I think he's
going to be thrilled with it there might
be one or two things that he might
change it's completely up to him but
overall I think it's a pretty solid
build that we have here yeah that's
pretty much going to wrap it up for this
part 1 video part 2 is going to be me
getting all the parts in building the
damn thing and potentially you know
doing some testing on it if you guys are
interested in that but that's going to
do it for this video guys so thank you
so much for tuning in I told
is going to be quick and dirty I told
you so hopefully you guys don't mind too
much if you enjoyed the video be sure to
toss me a like before you go and be sure
to get subscribed to the channel for
more tech stuff coming at you really
soon have it going guys I'll see you in
the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
