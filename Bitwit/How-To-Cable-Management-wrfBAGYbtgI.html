up guys i'm proud to announce that this
is my first how-to video which
essentially means i'm out of products to
review but this is a good thing because
what I'm talking about today isn't issue
many PC builders including myself
struggle with on a regular basis and not
knowing how to treat it can have a
negative impact on your performance by
the way I'm sorry if this sounds like an
ad for a rectal dysfunction cable
management is the topic at hand and
today I'll be going over some quick tips
to get your rig nice and tidy but for
those of us new to PC building what is
cable management and why should I care
while according to the interwebs cable
management refers to an important step
during the installation of electrical
services and the subsequent installation
of equipment providing means to tightly
secure electrical data and other cables
in other words it's about strategically
arranging your cables in order to keep
them clean and organized
although giving the innards of your PC a
cleaner aesthetic isn't the only benefit
of cable management less cabling exposed
means less surface area for dust to
settle on which can filter file your
components at an increased rate and
potentially impede their performance
over time another key benefit of proper
cabling is healthier air flow for your
system with a large serving of cable
spaghetti in the way the air current
from your chassis fans is dramatically
stifled by the time it reaches the
components in your case this can cause
your hardware to overheat decreasing
performance and ultimately shortening
its overall lifespan so to prevent any
of that from happening you'll need
something to tie your cables with like
zip ties twist ties or velcro straps
among my zip ties I like to use a few
twist ties which are more forgiving if I
need to undo something you'll also want
to grab some scissors wire cutters or
nail clippers to cut off the excess
cable length of your cable ties I did
want to mention I'll be using a modular
power supply for this video which means
the cables can be physically removed
from the unit itself because this makes
the process of managing cables much
easier and provides cleaner results
overall I highly recommend opting for a
modular power supply for most computer
builds so now that we're all ready to go
at what point in the PC building process
does cable management actually begin
well of course everyone has their own
way of doing things but generally
speaking you can install nearly all of
your components
before plugging in your first cable to
components I would refrain from
installing at this point would be the
video card which can sometimes block
access to your SATA connectors if it's
long enough and the CPU cooler which can
obstruct access to your 8 pin CPU
connector that's why I usually get this
cable routed in first plug the a pin
cable into the motherboard and route the
rest of it through the nearest routing
hole most cases have a hole or two at
the very top above the motherboard as a
rule of thumb you always want the cable
to travel the shortest distance possible
between its connector and a routing hole
using routing holes hides the bulk of
cabling behind the motherboard tray and
is where most of the nitty-gritty cable
management will take place cases often
have a routing hole mix of the power
supply as well thread the other end of
your a pin cable through this opening
and connected to your power supply
you'll want to leave a little bit of
slack here making sure not to pull the
cables so tight that it puts strain on
the power supply or the motherboard
connectors and this rule does apply to
all of the cabling in your system next
move on to your 24 pin ATX motherboard
cable connect it to the power supply if
it isn't already attached like mine is
and route it through the same grommet
you used for the 8 pin cable from here
run it out of the hole nearest to the
motherboard connector before plugging it
in since this and the 8 pin connector
are the thickest cables in your system
you'll want to keep them from
overlapping each other keeping things as
flat as possible you'll notice some
cases like this one have tie-down points
that hold cables securely in place flat
against the motherboard tray I'm going
to hold off on using these for now until
I've connected more cables and can
better visualize where everything should
go now we can move on to plugging in the
front panel connectors well these are
typically located close together on the
motherboard
they shouldn't all necessarily get
routed through the same grommet check
your case to make sure which routing
hole makes the most sense for each
individual cable on the backside I use
twist ties to secure the cables to
various tie-down points while making a
path to the optical drive bay where any
excess cabling can be coiled into a loop
and placed up in the corner of the case
since I'll be plugging in my fans next
now is a good time to install the CPU
cooler if you're installing a closed
loop liquid cooler make sure the fan
cables are facing toward the back of the
case and that you route them through the
appropriate holes while they're still
accessible I decided to connect the fan
splitter that came with my CPU cooler to
one of my motherboard CPU fan headers
after routing it through the top routing
hole I connected
radiator fans and led the cables away
towards the front panel connectors as
for the pump cable I hid the excess
length by routing it between two DIMM
slots before connecting it to the CPU
fan header assuming you'll be connecting
your fans directly to your motherboard
scope out the location of each fan
header and decide which is best
positioned for each of your fans not all
of your fan cables may be long enough to
route behind the motherboard so tie up
any excess cable length and position it
out of sight before plugging into the
header when routing fan cables behind
the motherboard is an option tie them
down so they're not visible on the other
side of the case moving on to your SATA
power and SATA data cables for your hard
drives and SSDs most motherboards come
with two types of SATA data cables
straight angle which have flat
connections on both sides and right
angle with one flat and one right angle
connection personally I like to use the
right angle cables connecting the flat
side to the motherboard and the right
angle head to my drives included with
your power supply you'll find a SATA
power cable with multiple connectors
plug one end into your power supply and
route it behind the motherboard if
you've installed your drives adjacent to
each other you should be able to power
them all with a single cable once your
drives are wired up tie the SATA power
cable to your data cables for additional
tidiness finally it's time to install
the video card and connect your PCI
Express cables plug them into your power
supply route them behind the motherboard
tray and out through the closest opening
tuck away any unused pins out of sight
and use a zip tie or two to tighten up
multiple PCI Express cables for a
cleaner look now that all of the cables
in your system have been connected you
can begin to tighten up everything on
the back end by now you can start to see
different groupings of cables forming
naturally being conscious not to overlap
any of the thicker cables use your best
judgement to decide which cables should
be bunched together based on length and
direction you almost want the final
image of your cables to look like a
series of freeways with clear defined
paths heading in different directions
use as many zip ties as you like but
bear in mind too this equates to how
much work you'll be making for yourself
if you need to remove or replace a cable
for this reason I tend to use twist ties
for cables I'm more likely to remove in
the future follow all these steps and
you'll experience one of the greatest
things about building a PC being able to
fit that damn side panel on as always
guys toss me a like on this video if you
found it helpful and leave me some
feedback in the
remember to bookmark my Amazon affiliate
link and do not pick up a torso chassis
while you're at it because I'm currently
in the process of switching over to the
same printing company that Logan from
tech syndicate uses for all of his
merchandise on epic pants com if you
guys have ever bought anything from
Logan in the past you know the quality
is super legit so I'm pretty stoked to
be opening the new store which should be
launching very soon until next time I'm
kind of awesome Stiles Network thank you
guys for watching subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
