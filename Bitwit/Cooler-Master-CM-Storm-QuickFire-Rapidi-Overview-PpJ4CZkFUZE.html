awesomesauce news today I'll be giving
you a first look and overview of this
brand new keyboard from Coolermaster
this is their CM storm quickfire rapid
eye according to the manufacturer the I
stands for intelligence which leads me
to believe that Coolermaster must not
have a very high opinion of their former
quick fire rapid keyboard and while I'm
the last person on earth to ever
patronize aging hardware today I will be
looking at some of the features that
distinguish the rapid eye from its older
idiot brother so let's begin taking from
the Quickfire rapid the rapid eye is a
10 keyless board designed for
portability and travel put to death as
the age-old stereotype that gamers stay
cooped up in their mothers basements
when in fact they often venture out of
their homes and into their friend's
mother's basements to partake in land
parties and other gaming festivities
this makes the RapidEye a worthy option
for on-the-go gamers and land party
animals alike besides portability
another advantage of a 10 keyless layout
is that it enables more ergonomic
mousing for right-handed users omitting
a numpad moves the mouse closer to the
center reducing the reach required to
grab it this movement engages muscles in
the shoulder back and neck and
repetition over long periods of time can
lead to soft tissue damage and
ultimately your agonizing and untimely
death that's right folks purchase this
keyboard and you will live forever all
keys on the rapid I feature Cherry MX
brown switches and are individually
backlit with white LEDs coolermaster has
traditionally matched the LED color with
the switch color of the mechanical
keyboards but their decision to not use
brown LEDs on this device has quite
literally saved it from looking like n
key rollover allows you to press any
number of keys on the board
simultaneously without missing a single
keystroke some argue this feature is a
per flow but I believe it's a selling
point any radiation victim with extra
limbs can appreciate included with the
rapid eye is a braided microUSB cable
that plugs into a port behind the
keyboard on the bottom you'll find two
fold away rubber feet that give the
keyboard a slight incline for a more
ergonomic feel when typing and the less
organ amah keel when smashing it against
your face the f5 through f8 keys let you
change the key repeat rate from 1x all
the way up to 8 X so you can execute
in-game commands faster and save lots of
time spamming YouTube comments now as
far as what makes the RapidEye smarter
than your average keyboard much of the
answer lies and how the board handles
LED functionality which is also what
largely sets it apart from the quick
fire rapid an onboard 32-bit ARM
processor executes a number of led
functions that extend the usability of
the keyboard and bring about some robust
features that will have you saying man
these features are robust many of the
common LED features from previous
Coolermaster keyboards are carried over
by the rapid eye including brightness
adjustment and the O so played out
breathing LEDs which I'm now calling the
yawning LEDs new to the game however is
reactive illumination where each key
lights up for a split second upon being
depressed did you know ten out of ten
Keys suffer from depression similarly
the new trailing effect does the same
thing
except the LED stay lit for a moment
longer offering a slick aesthetic that
you'll definitely want to show off to
your friends just make sure if you have
a girl over she never finds out how
giddy this makes you or you will never
see her again ever but undoubtedly the
most useful new feature of the rapid eye
is the implementation of individually
programmable LEDs with on-the-fly
recording you can select any number of
keys to stay illuminated and save your
settings in one of the four customizable
profiles from there you can dynamically
switch between modes to suit your needs
whether it be typing gaming or my
personal favorite sexy solo time and
that folks concludes this overview once
again this has been the CM storm
quickfire rapid eye gaming mechanical
keyboard with Cherry MX brown switches
