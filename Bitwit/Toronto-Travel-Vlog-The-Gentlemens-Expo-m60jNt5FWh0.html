are here in Toronto Canada
we've made our landing at the what's the
name of this Airport Airport Canada
Airport but anyway we're going to
baggage claim now we're here to cover
the gentlemen's Expo and you think there
are gonna be strippers there you're
totally right no probably not I don't
think so they're gonna have the finest
folks talking about whiskey and how to
trim your beard and how to how to be a
man and other sexist things that women
find attractive and now boo is about to
get arrested so this is this is a good
time to stop nope this going on my
channel ooh I don't cut nothing out
double negative that means I do cut
stuff out but that's not what I meant to
say
I heard Toronto has a really nice County
town they will welcome us with open arms
if we tell them we're from new egg
yeah you'll get happy ending forever
there's your happy ending mr. Li
footsteps going up to right there yeah
what the answer for that
anyway you mom
all right guys we minutes at the hotel
room is about half an hour from the
airport we're just settling in right now
we each have our own rooms this time for
this trip it's it's pretty cool me
Steven who each get to have our own bed
and so sharing one big one like that one
time so it's actually a pretty nice
hotel the last hotel we're in maneuver
in Toronto for PAX East was a pretty
dinky little place it was cool and all
and everyone was really nice but this is
this is like a ten story building what
who is that I'd like a pizza pie oh
hello Steve let's have a steak let's go
okay we're gonna have steak now and it's
freezing freezing good thing I brought a
hoodie good thing Steve Brotherhood mr.
LAN didn't bring a hoodie
he's gonna suffer for it that's okay
because he bought lobster on my credit
card so I don't feel sorry for you oh
look let's burn this place to the ground
morning everyone it is Friday morning in
Toronto Ontario Canada and we kind of
just woke up it's about some most noon
but we're out here on the street about
to get some food and right next to our
hotel is this fun place I don't know if
you guys are very familiar with bub but
it's one of my favorite foods it's
Vietnamese soup basically noodle soup
and I'm obviously never been in this
place so I'm not sure how good it is but
I was thinking maybe we'll do a little
bit of a tutorial today and I'll teach
you guys how to make a decent bowl of
pho or at least how to prep one so let's
let's go it so these are bean sprouts or
as I like to call them Vietnamese french
fries
and sort of ketchup in sriracha that's
you need these people don't do that
right so here's a bowl and the first
thing you want to do is grab some
Vietnamese French fries dump that in
there just like that they usually come
with limes citrus doesn't matter squeeze
it in anyway they'll be alright
I usually like dump my lime in it
afterwards let it soak in the juices
first squirt you're your friend make
sure that he has hot sauce on and then
can you proceed to putting hot sauce in
your soup if you don't like hot stuff
doesn't matter put it in put in a lot
he's doing it and then there's poison
sauce I know it sounds like poison sauce
and sometimes it even tastes like it's
basically fish sauce but it's it's
really terrible by itself but it's
really good with this stuff if you don't
like fish I don't care
and there you go and you gotta mix it up
and three seconds and there's the
finished product
okay so we've made it to the gentlemen's
Expo here at the Metro Toronto
Convention Center and there's big Jack
bird ah nights Nick it's not real don't
worry it's time to go inside see with
what they have here should be pretty
interesting okay we've got men care
excellent
oh there's the new egg pavilion see new
egg signs everywhere and there will be
all of our trusted tech vendors that
we'll be interviewing today
and they've got a lot of other stuff
here that doesn't necessarily relate to
tech but it has some way been deemed to
be manly enough to be here today so um I
guess we'll check out some of that as
well I'll probably do a little tour walk
around and take some shots of all the
things that I think are interesting that
you guys might find interesting too
alright so we just wrapped up day one of
gentlemen's Expo I believe it was ace
was 8 was it alright so we just wrapped
up day 1 it's been a long day my first
tempted member my first it was like that
alright so just an update this is
history in the making right here mr. Lam
has created a Twitter account so you can
now follow the infamous incredulous mr.
Lam on Twitter mr. Lam what's your
Twitter handle so people can follow you
at meme figurines just just how it's
spelled no fancy tricks and the reason
why the reason for that name is because
he's also starting a YouTube channel
pretty soon where he actually does
unboxings and reviews and overviews of
action figures and he's got like over 3
400 figurines it's crazy it's pretty
nuts so uh so yeah you guys should
follow that there's a bunch of white
stuff falling from the sky I'm not sure
what it is I'm from Southern California
so this is foreign to me I think I think
we're experiencing what's known as
seasons hmm very peculiar people look
cold
I'm glad I'm in a car alright so over
here at these almonds Expo day 2 and
we're at the new egg Canada booth and
you can see there's a pretty extensive
lines emitting from the new a Canada
booth and they're all waiting for John
Jones or John's bones Jones who's a
professional UFC fighter he's actually
be lightweight champion ship title
holder
like i said judge
very good
all right guys we're at the grocery
store right now it's called no-frills
they have pretty low prices for a
grocery store in Canada and we're just
getting a bunch of chips you can see and
they got no frills here and we don't
want no frills probably throw no
chapstick and we're also looking for
testing because Steve's lips dry don't
ask him this is my outro for our Toronto
Canada trip it's been an awesome time
with Stephen Drew we've met some awesome
people and some people already knew
Tiffany Marta and Casey have all been
really awesome they bought us drinks and
we're gonna leave them here today and
we'll be back next time cheers guys any
closing words from Canada it's all the
Americans at home
is better aren't they adorable alright
alright guys thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
