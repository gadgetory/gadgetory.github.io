interests I know it's your if I have to
pee it's your half and I can just go pee
that's true just fuck off and just I
just go man no one care well don't just
go I have to clean this carpet up after
the after every show remember that but
hello welcome are we screaming - both
yes oh crap welcome guys back to awesome
Hardware episode 148 this is site B if
you missed side a you can check it out
on Paul's channel you should become
slash Paul's hardware or you can follow
the link in my description it will be
there as well this is good it was great
it was a great half show it was it was a
wonderful energy we answered lots of
good questions from the audience
that's about many important good stories
as well so check that out
if you missed it if I'm welcome back hey
oh yeah what Kyle actually took all the
good stories this week I did so if you
weren't impressed already by my half of
the show you certainly will pee now
this is your reward the minor gonna
remind blowing truth bombs that are
about to be dropped on your face yeah
straight from Kyle's asshole right now
yep yep I'm just basically - shitting
knowledge onto your chest oh we forgot
to do this oh the disclaimer this we may
use adult language from time to time
during the stream and sometimes we
forget to say that before we actually
start saying those so we apologize we
don't usually do that anymore and now
you've been warned Heydrich in multiple
ways hide your kids hide your wife yeah
and unless your wife's cool with that
sort of thing down bring her along
my wife is we could use a higher female
rate anyway female Europe alright uh we
have stores that we sell stuff in mine
is between dog tech store feel free to
patronize our stores rip game pet shirt
it's still still still here that it's a
it's it's a pork console controller game
pad getting massacred or about to get
devoured it looks like by a what I would
assume is an RGB mechanical keyboard and
looks like a Death Adder but a Gaming
Mouse essentially these are not directly
affiliated with any manufacturer of
course not and any any no coincidental
similarities or surely purely
coincidence the shirts opinions are its
own yes bottle openers very nice and
hoodies shirts glasses desk mats the
desk mats have been very popular these
are lightweight hoodies
they are super lightweight good for all
weather when it's slightly chilly or
just on a regular day Paul store is
Paul's hardware net he has a brand new
oxblood colored thumb screw logo shirt
which has been doing well so far
and I really like that color it's very
nice kind of kind of different it's dark
kind of like black but it's a little bit
different add some a little bit of color
to your wardrobe which I fancy very much
but not too much I mean obviously you
don't want to look like it's all
brighten everything's good
no fuck that you're like you're happy
like oh well look at that happy asshole
we also got the Heather midnight this is
also a new addition hashtag free Heather
Heather midnight my wife get my my wife
Heather against royalties every time he
mentioned her name during one of our
plugs our merge plugs so one day we'll
we'll hashtag free Heather for reals
and also hashtag free dioxin these were
things I was about to say there that I
didn't so welcome thank you alright
let's move on to hot and heavy hardware
this is our first segment of the night
on this half of the show where we talk
about hardware that's hot and heavy our
first article talks about some hardware
that is not necessarily heavy maybe
maybe kind of hot in certain certain use
case scenarios but this is the samsung
970 pro and 970 Evo SSD that have been
launched and holy crap these things are
awesome this is an article from PC gamer
these are like the leading like
best-in-class and via knee drives that
you can get on the market right now or I
should say the 960s were the 960 Evo
nice 960 pro and a lot of competitors
were trying to top those in terms of
performance and
looks like the only manufacturer to have
top Samsung when it comes to the nvme
MDOT two game is Samsung because now
they have the 970 series and these
things are even faster than the last
generation let's talk is it is it
coincidence that so so you're right like
the 960 Pro has maintains yeah it's like
if you want the fastest time to nvme
drive that's what you get but just
recently I think in the pet within the
past month we talked about Western
Digital right coming out with their WD
black which well not quite as fast as
the 960 was in the ballpark yes pretty
close right it definitely didn't de
thrown it but it made for a very
competitive alternate and it was I
believe it was cheaper yes so is there
any ways to performer there any
correlation between the WD Jack Black
Drive coming out and then suddenly
Samsung's like oh we got the 970 now I
feel like that I feel like that WD black
drive came out way too soon for the nine
70s to just pop up okay I feel like for
a big company like Samsung they've
probably been working on the 970 ever
since the 960s released so so I think I
think this has definitely been you know
it's not like a rushed launch or
anything that we've seen from like intel
on their cpu say that would make sense
unless you're like me and you believe
that Samsung has just had this lined up
and they've just been sitting on it
they're like once we have competition
we'll go ahead and launch yeah that
could be sitting on it you know if
they're head of the market then what's
what's really the point you know they
have no need to launch a new product if
they're still number one so that's a
fair argument as well maybe they were
already in development but the 970 was
already ready ready to go but their
finger was on the trigger waiting for
some slight competition to roll in or
pulling it to clarify I have zero basis
in fact or or he works for Samsung
anything for saying any of that stuff
Paul works for samsung part time I just
do I just do often think it's
interesting when you see competing
products and the timing of the launch of
certain ones it's all it's all a game it
really is all a chess game when it comes
to these manufacturers I mean we can't
really really because we don't really
our business model doesn't surround
products and selling products to a
consumer base
it's like content which is different
when you play the game of chess you win
or you
it's very intense Paul it's Game of
Thrones this is good very intense for
SSD talk though uh so what's new with
this these SSDs you get a new phoenix
controller same one that's been found in
samsung's current client SSD and their
enterprise SSD the PM nine eight one and
PM ninety three respectively which
probably no real gamer is gonna be
interested in but the same powerful
controller is built into these that was
not available in the last gen nine sixty
drives the speeds have also been
improved the 970 pro is is pretty crazy
it's got thirty five hundred megabytes
per second sequential reads and twenty
seven hundred megabytes per second
sequential writes the p the the the 70
Evo the fuckin 970 Evo has the same read
speeds as the 970 pro but has only
slightly lower sequential write speeds
at 2500 so that's pretty good bargain up
to 30% higher sequential writes than the
last generation of drives ha 5-year
warranty or up to 12 hundred terabytes
written which is 50 times higher than
the last generation so the write
endurance of these of these drives has
been much improved according to the spec
sheet and they will be available up to
one terabyte for the 970 Pro and up to
two terabyte for the 970 Evo which is
interesting because the 970 Pro I'm
sorry the 960 Pro last generation pro
series of nvme drives was available in
two terabytes I stuck two of them in the
end through elite build that I did last
year but now they've sort of switched
the role so if you want the higher
capacity drive you're gonna be looking
at the 970 Evo not the pro pros only
going up to one terabyte it's now and
you can get that one terabyte 970 Pro
for 629 dollars and the two terabyte 97
evo for a whopping eight hundred and
forty nine dollars which is forty three
cents per gigabyte not the highest cost
per gigabyte we've seen but that is
still significantly more than what a
mechanical drive cost you I was I know
pass I was gonna point actually to the
lowest skew on this stack very
reasonable turn in 50 gig 970 Evo four
hundred and twenty bucks
very reasonable I mean that puts the
matrix a 250 gig range SSD will cost you
eighty to ninety yeah that's only
another thirty dollar premium over that
to get yourself like one of the fastest
nvme drives out there right I see this
being a popular core like operating
system drive forward I'm sure you'll
definitely see these drives popping up
in future builds from both Paul and I
but these are gonna be available May 7th
so keep your eyes out for those let's
move on to our next article for which is
from hex is stunned that AMD has added
some new AP use to their lineup
including the rise in three 2200 GE and
the rise in 520 400 G II which basically
is the same type of parts that we've
seen already released except it's got a
e at the end there's advertising tie-in
with General Electric no this has
nothing to do with that brand GE your
name no Paul it's the same old G they
bring good things to life the G stands
for great and the e stands for
efficiency great if no I don't know oh
well the e yes but the G I just made I
pulled out in my ass he does stand for
efficiency yes that's what it says in
the article the e suffix stands for
efficiency so these are lower TDP chips
than their than their counterparts which
is just the G SKU the non e scue
rise in 320 200 G and rise in 520 400 G
ap use that launched earlier this year
just a month or two ago so these are
based on the same ap use with slightly
lower clock speeds there's been some
silicon Billy binning too in order to
achieve that 35 watt TDP versus 65 watt
on the counterparts rise in 320 200 G
e sports four cores no SMT so no threat
and not more than any four threads which
is for course doesn't have eight threads
or anything 3.2 thank you very much 3.2
gigahertz base 3.6 gigahertz boost as
opposed to 3.5 and 3.7 on the non e scue
with with the same Vega 8 GPU running 8
cores at 1100 megahertz and then the
risin 5 2400 GE has 4 cores and 8
threads very much like the resin 5 2400
G non e scue slightly lower clock speeds
as I mentioned 3.2 gigahertz phase 3
point 8 gigahertz boost that's let's see
that is 0.4 gigahertz that's 400
megahertz slower on the base clock than
the non e scue and just 100 megahertz
slower for that that turbo boost there
they got 11 graphics with 11 cores
running at 1250 that's the same speed
the GPU is running at the same speed as
the non e 2400 G so price and
availability is TBD but these are
officially on the map they're on the
grid this has been reported on AMD zone
website so these are real chips that are
that are coming soon I will be seeing
these probably bundled with you know
with with I don't know with some kind of
cooler
I would imagine race fire rate stealth
and yeah new IP use probably probably
Wraith stealth for being a 35 watt TDP
chip for sure so um so basically same
specs as the 2200 G and 2400 G but lower
frequencies in order to hit the lower
TDP of 35 watts yep okay mmm-hmm imagine
those might be useful for some people
yeah maybe some small form-factor HT pcs
that don't really have the room in them
for for a decent cooler maybe you can
only get away with like a 45 millimeter
tall cooler or something like that I was
gonna suggest actually what I will
probably be using a risin apu for soon
which is a
one of basically oh it's great you've
always had great taste and effort but
for a PC versus for a FreeNAS server
that was there are rise in motherboards
that support ECC memory mm-hmm and so
it's a very viable lower cost solution
for something like a freenas server true
so my question would be when these new
lower TDP CPUs will I mean the other
thing it's like you could buy at 2,200 G
or 2400 G and underclock it and get
effectively the same thing these are
just shipping from the manufacturer with
with those speeds enabled right so there
you go but um yeah I'm actually I will
be doing a FreeNAS builds nice-nice I'll
probably be doing a server build soon to
will see Intel crimson Canyon Nook has
been spotted in benchmarks and photos
also faxes sorry photos and details have
been linked by german website win future
and twitter user tongue api sak also
benchmarked one of these guys the
crimson Canyon nooks will be first of
their kind to use the Canon Lake EU
processors but even more cool but also
be the first nooks to have it just
screech GPU which is something I've been
waiting for for a long time yeah believe
it or not it'll have a Radeon 550 mobile
GPU with two gigs of gddr5 yeah isn't
that cool now obviously this won't
compete with something like the Hades
Canyon that just came out featuring a
core i7 processor and bacon graphics but
it will be much much more affordable
than Hades Canyon and it'll still make
hopefully for a decent HTPC slash light
gaming system in a super small
form-factor the great thing about the
Knux is you can literally place them
anywhere they're very tiny they're so
tiny they're literally this looks to be
maintaining this
very tiny form factor it's almost
smaller kyle has one I just couldn't
resist having one just right here this
is how small a nook is and and you can
literally place it behind your monitor
mount it there it actually does come
with a bracket I believe if you want to
like mount it more securely and they're
also very serviceable so you can get in
there and you know swap out your memory
put in an end to nvme SSD if you so
choose which is very cool very very very
cool little devices and you know they're
starting to get more advanced this one
has USB 3.1 type C it's fancy
remember the yeah first nexus the yellow
I believe that I do that might be three
point one and that's three oh really I I
could be wrong I'm not sure exactly what
the yellow indicates but but they're
nice little nice little systems they're
just so compact it's like there's really
a difficult it's it's hard to argue
building like a budget small PC for your
parents versus when that's available
something like this yeah yeah and I
really like the fact that you can buy
them either kit it out or completely
bare bones if you want to add your own
stuff super not even have some upgrade
ability and flexibility and stuff yep
moving on we've got the MSI mag pylon
chassis so Emma sighs making cases now
holy crap ha
and not just cases for their pre-built
systems that we've seen in the past but
these are just like standalone jassi's
for the gaming community these are
released under their gaming deer line
which is the first I've heard of it
the magpie LAN is four high there's two
cases here the magpie LAN for the high
end class and the mag bunker for the
more budget oriented users so first
talking about the high end magpie lon
we've got three four millimeter thick
tempered glass panels on the front left
and right of the case so triple
tempered glass fits up to eat I'm sorry
ATX motherboards with dual three and a
half inch or
Dule two and a half inch drive bays 45
litres Kyle forty five liters imagine
how much Soda you could fill this case
with I don't have to imagine Paul I
already know that it's exactly forty
five liters but if you're buying two
litres though you'll be stuck with an
extra liter of soda to keep in mind that
will probably come up in their reviews
yeah okay so got three front mystic
light configurable RGB fans which our
motherboard supported yay RGB fans are
always great I'm wondering if these are
kind of like om fans and Emma size just
slap their branding on or if they
actually made these fans and house I'm
very curious about that I have low
expectations me too
magnetic dust filters of course vertical
GPU support law and then the mag bunker
for budget oriented system users
there's no integrated fans on this one
there's no RGB there's only a front and
left tempered glass a side panel so
there's no front panel I'm sorry there's
no right panel that might have been in
the corner of shame that they did not
care to include but there's only a
single 120 millimeter non RGB fan at the
rear no pricing or availability is is
listed for these cases I don't think
they look bad at least from first glance
at least the mag pylon which is the only
case that we they're really showing us
right now but from what the article says
the case and frame itself is very
similar so I don't think the mag bunker
looks much different than the mag
pylon apart from like the included fans
and the tempered glass panel on the
right so there's mag bunker right there
the bokor yeah so you can see it's just
it's kind of like add your own fans type
of thing which I think a lot of users go
for these days right fans have guns have
come so far with RGB and all that shit
that fans are a very personal thing that
people you know are very particular
about now so yeah you know go for the
bunker if you don't care about the right
side panel having glass it's probably
not a big deal for most people save some
money there so yeah MSI cases I mean you
know what's weird did you see any
pictures of the actual internal layout
like without the side panel remove
just this 45 we just that which is still
kind of hard to see it looks like
they've got two rows of rubber grommets
which is cool for cable management I
guess well but why the second row on the
right if it's only supporting ATX
motherboards that ATX boards gonna stop
before that first row of first column of
grommets you're right
kind of just interesting like these
grommets are useless right I'm just
wondering why I've never seen that in a
case that only supports ATX boards so
you know and and then hey you got
vertical GPU support vertical GPU
support I'm hoping that it's further
back away from the tempered glass side
panel and not just like right up against
it it kind of defeats the purpose it
looks like it does include the adapter
and riser card riser cable alright it's
interesting
well MSI they make cases now you make
cases MSI world renowned case
manufacturer that's definitely news for
today moving on though to our last
article for hot and heavy hardware cryo
rig has released their c7 copper cooler
this article from tech report now I
remember checking out the copper line of
coolers from cry rig at last year's
Computex being pretty impressed and also
very curious just to see how these would
perform apparently they've replaced
their original c7 heatsink with all
copper material so obviously copper is
more heat conductive than aluminum which
is what their their regular model is
using and so that can potentially give
you up to a 15% thermal performance
increase over the standard version
according to cryo 15% better thermal
performance compared to its own standard
copper sorry standard aluminum c7 model
you still get 4 6 millimeter wide heat
pipes there's a low profile heatsink and
when I went when I saw the Cryer igloo
tonight when I went to the Craig booth
at last year's CES like I'm sorry last
year's copy text they had not just the
c7 but they have like
all their big yeah the colors the h7
they all have like copper versions of
them but I think the c7 particularly
makes a lot of sense to go full copper
because anyone purchasing a c7 most
likely has very limited Z space in their
case for a CPU cooler which means you
can't just add more fins you can't just
add more heat pipes to the equation when
you're limited on space the one thing
that you can change and have control
over is the material as you use for the
thermal dissipation so if you're using
copper instead you can maintain the same
slim size very short size height Z
height of this cooler still fit it into
like you know an end case or something
like that but have greater cooling
potential to potentially fit in a
higher-end CPU so I'm very curious to
see how this thing performs if the 15%
acclaim is accurate I think this is
definitely worth testing I'll keep my
eye on this guy and and of course there
is a price premium here right using
copper materials is gonna be a lot more
expensive even on a 57 thin array like
this one then say an aluminum equivalent
so we're actually jumping from the
original c7 width which was $30 MSRP to
now $50 50 it's quite a bit more for a
such a slim profile but you know what
right now mini ITX like super small tiny
mini ITX small form-factor builds are
all the rage and more specifically small
form-factor but high performance systems
are increasingly popular so I think this
is a niche product it's a very niche
product but it's a niche product that
doesn't have many alternatives so I'm
very curious to see how this works out
and supports aim for and 11 c11 5xu you
look you listed quite a few reasons why
this is a good starter
product for Craig with their copper
series I have a couple additions to that
okay but not from the perspective of use
case but from the manufacturing
perspective because what your whatever
but what it really boils down to here is
that a metal like copper costs a lot
more money and this is actually
something that I've mentioned once or
twice before I'm not sure in what
context but if you go back to the mid
2000s like 2005 2006 2007 there was a
trends that came about with graphic
skirts which was graphics cards went
from being single slot GPUs to double
slot they realized like oh let's just
use another slot and make the cooling
solutions a lot beefier in order to
accommodate GPUs that output a lot more
heats but they started just throwing
copper into that if you look at the
whole heat sinks yeah the entire heat
sink all the fins was all made of copper
if you look at like old radeon HD like
58 70s and stuff like that um you can
see these old designs where it's like a
red PCB and they're just a massive
copper like there's heat pipes and
there's a heatsink and like over
everything and then in 2008 the global
economy collapsed and the price of
precious metals like gold like the
things that have sort of less elastic
pricing that went way up because those
suddenly became some of the most viable
things that you could invest money into
so the global economy affected the
design of stuff like heat sinks for
graphics cards and suddenly you went
from all copper designs to like alright
let's put a copper contact plate and
everything else aluminium a much cheaper
metal so sure my thought all that makes
my thought about this be like alright
this is the smallest
CPU cooler that Craig makes so if they
want to test the waters and be like
alright are people willing to pay extra
for this because that's really what it
boils down to this is 20 bucks more than
the aluminum
are people willing to pay more for the
additional heat dissipation that this is
going to provide and is you know are we
going to be able to charge enough money
more enough dollars more for these
coolers that will account for the
increased cost of the copper that they
have to pay for right because there's a
base bill of materials cost for the
copper so from the business perspective
this cooler also makes a lot of sense
because they're able to put this on the
market with a fairly minimal investment
when it comes to the amount of copper
that they actually is a smaller heatsink
they're more feasible forever just
wanted to throw that out there
and no one's gonna like by an h7 for
like a hundred dollars right if it's all
copper probably not as good as it might
be no one's gonna pay you know be like
how well do they cool compared to like
the not the high-end noctua coolers cuz
that's always the standard yeah if you
can somehow outperform outperforming 10
HD 15 then you'll probably have on the
map you'll probably have some people
interested in your cooler true but nice
III and I do imagine like you said for
small form-factor builds this would
probably be pretty useful and I'd like
to put an 8700 can or this thing and see
how it does I'd probably get pretty
toasty but I'm sure it would do its best
just for the walls okay all right let's
move on to our next segment which is
pimp my PC you guys have submitted
pictures and specs of your beautiful
rigs or maybe not so beautiful rigs and
are anxiously awaiting Paul and I to
tell you what you've done wrong how to
rectify and redeem yourselves for the
bad horrible PC builders you are know
probably you're probably just fine but
we can help you out a little bit and get
things up to speed if your dilapidated
systems first off first time we've got
that guru guru that grew with a bunny
with chainsaw is very very hazardous
profile picture there NZXT s340 with a
risin 2,700 X like that we have a nice
second gen resin ship already here yeah
and this belt is a new-build
asus x 40
for 70 F 16 gigs of Corsair RGB 36
hundred megahertz samsung 960 Evo 250
gig for the boot a couple of the drives
there and an asus r9 380 x OC gonna do
more upgrades when the new GPUs come out
good know um alright
guru let's see very clean cable
management is on point obviously some
custom sleeves cables would do you
favors in that department but the black
looks fine black looks fine but if you a
little bit a little bit I'm just saying
I would take the sticker off of my SSD
and just make that SanDisk drive blend
in completely with the basement all
black oh yeah okay oh yeah
I would definitely go that route um I
really like the Corsair fans of the
front the right white trim maybe employ
one of those at the rear place that
stock NZXT fan there good balance things
a bit balance things out bit I want to
say whatever whatever you know whatever
wire this is right here is standing out
to me oh wow I didn't know coming out
across the heatsink and I don't know
where it's going this might be this
might be the wire from this rear exhaust
fan just being routed over here to plug
into a fan hitter that's down oh I see
and I see that cable on the right above
the fan I think that's from the Wraiths
prism you sure it could be either way
you don't see that cable what's that
cable from I think this is the fan cable
coming up going back and then being
brought out back here to plug into a fan
head of the static oh I see you think
it's going back around because it I
think the Wraiths prism just has this
one plug coming out right here maybe
you're right but I I could be wrong
about that
either way this cable is just standing
out a little bit to me tuck that away
somewhere you know you can tuck it where
the where the fan cable is from your
wraith prism you see how you kind of can
put it right between their consoles
together the baton sinks but but really
minor critiques this is a very
clean-looking builds and
I don't think there's a whole lot more
that could be done here without you know
new hardware and you have new hardware
so don't worry about it you're you're
good right well done yeah okay thanks
guru others we have Tim mr. Tim Tim okay
you 71 our debut case the EVGA x2 99
dark motherboard and I 970 900 X running
at 4.6 gigahertz an ek supremacy Evo X
99 waterblock he can't 420 C radiator 32
gigs of course I avenged selfie X 24
hundred megahertz ram to EVGA 1080 TI
for the win three hybrids sli graphics
cards to one terabyte samsung evil 850
SSDs the two terabyte Seagate Barracuda
hard drive and a 1200 watt EVGA
supernova power supply alright wow wow I
read all those specs before looking at
the picture I'm kind of glad I did I I
would start by making your bed but that
your bed just looks so messy where's the
bed right oh the bed over here yeah I
mean you have any like sheets on there
like there's blankets like all I'm a
good couch then you you need to make
your calnet shirt
alright okay but based on the PC what do
you think in Paul first impressions okay
okay so your your liquid tubing runs are
kind of tortured that's that's that's
what I'm seeing here cabling actually
looks pretty good if we're just looking
at the cabling like you're 24-pin you
got some nice clean cables coming up
here for your for your graphics power
but we have flexible tubing not only in
the hybrid GPUs which I'm completely
aware this is probably the only viable
place that you could put these at least
to have any any sense of symmetry I mean
you could have put one on the rear
exhaust here maybe but that might be
awkward those seem very stretched to me
and then the
the clear tubing for the CPU going
through there is is just visually it's
not working for me at all just not yeah
I'm with you on that functionally
functionally again you could probably
have a really cool and quiet running
system here which which you can put the
side panel on and not look at and be
perfectly happy with the best way to
solve this is hard line yeah go hard
line hard line yeah because then you'll
be able to actually plan out the runs
whereas the flexible tubing from where
everything's placed that if you weren't
changing the location of anything like
your reservoir or your radiator the only
real way to make things look a lot
cleaner would be or the best way to look
make it look cleaner would be to do some
hard line runs and obviously you have to
get some new fittings for that if that's
an investment that you're willing to
make I think you could do wonders for
your system and get it looking like
almost like a show rig because it has a
lot of potential you know you've got an
SLI configuration it's it's pretty beefy
and stuff everything else is really
clean except for the for the water
cooling runs that's the one thing that I
would change and also it's interesting
that you have the fans for your GPU
radiators set to intake it set to intake
and he also removed the labels on them
I'd be curious to see what kind of temps
you'd get if you flip the fans and made
them exhaust it might not affect much
but I think it'd be worth a try yeah
yeah it could I just don't know how well
how good the ventilation is on the other
side of those radiators to be pulling
air in from do you know what I mean like
do you have do you usually leave the
back side panel off is that the thing is
that the factor that I'm missing is that
you usually just don't have the right
side panel on and so that I mean the
fans are able to intake air more
efficiently if if he modded like an air
filter or something over there
then that might be a really practical
solution so assuming he modded the side
panel yeah yeah so but nothing indicates
that he did so Jim Tim I think what it
comes down to for me is you just you
have some aesthetic stuff here that
really just doesn't work out but you
also probably have a very functional
system so if if it's at all important to
you
where looks are concerned and you have a
few hundred extra bucks lying around
then maybe some of our suggestions would
help someone saying that you that you
can get intake or exhaust out of the
right side of that case which okay I
still haven't really pinpointed what
case this is but if people in cheddar or
vouching for the fact that you can still
have some ventilation on the right side
then maybe you're fine with the fans
actually I think they I think the rear
the rear view of this what the cable
management is actually the but I think
the best look for to your side right
this is yeah it looks beautiful this is
really well done back here yeah very
clean with all that stuff going on and
everything yeah case is this does he
list it out there will take view 71 yeah
all right
Tim I don't feel like we've either made
your day or like we've sent you into the
next essential crisis or something
hopefully we've given you the push you
need to venture into hardline the
hardline world are lying or no hardline
what can you do with these hybrids
though like there's nothing that can be
done about those hybrids but I'm
removing the blocks in a different case
and yeah I don't know well yeah Tim you
have a beastly build and I'm sure it's
insanely powerful so yeah well done
there next up Jimmy I 546 MBK with the
Corsair H 100 I and asrock fatalities
z97 ex killer Corsair Vengeance Pro 16
gigs and some jurors with a see sonic
500 if you want power supply go with the
red and black theme here first thing I
noticed is that your GPU is in a isn't
the bottom slot
which might is probably an X 8 slot so
it probably won't cost you much in terms
of performance but thermally I feel like
your fans are being pushed against that
power supply basement a bit more than if
your card was in the top by 16 slot and
I don't see why why it couldn't be
installed in that top slot I would
probably put it in that top slot better
air flow so there are able to receive
here from the front intake fans
yes something going on up here I can't
tell what it is yeah he's got a couple
cards there there's a couple by one by
four cards that no they're not these are
these are like expansion cards or
something because they're not actually
plugged into PCI Oh Lots oh you're
you're right so this is these are just
connected these might be part of the
killer board does the killer board have
like extra USB or some type of i/o slots
that you can put down here I wouldn't
think I'm really not sure what could
they possibly be for yeah I mean it's a
z9 z 97 fatality words if they're not
plugged in to those slots then couldn't
he like that that's even more reason for
him to put the GPU up top yeah right
yeah so if you can reposition these
further down yeah they've got some
cables going to them wherever they're
plugging into or just get rid of them if
they're not necessary he's like
definitely move that graphics card up to
this upper slot it's it's a better
position for it it's better thermally if
there's any performance difference it's
probably pretty minimal like Cal said
you're probably running it by eight in
this lower slot but yeah give her so it
gives that graphics card a bit more oh
all the best opportunity that it had it
can have is to do its best yeah it's
working the hardest out of all the
components in there yeah besides a CPU
maybe but beyond that you got an a
pretty clean red and black scheme
remember those old NZXT LED strips or
whatever you want to call them I had
like the LED every every couple inches
or whatever oh yeah
but it was like a sleeved cable I will
say maybe remove your label from a power
supply and then I also say our supply
I'm sorry from the SSD yeah remove the
label from the SSD and then this powered
by C Sonic sticker or case back here is
it's doing nothing for me not match and
really I would remove that as well
I mean fixed those the few things though
very slight adjustments and you'll have
a much cleaner looking system I think
overall I agree very nice Jimmy thank
you very much you've got a lot of the
base components that you need to clean
things up so yeah you're in good shape
next we've got Nate it's super panda MSI
970 gaming FX 6200 H 115 eye and r9 390
from XFX with an antique 900 gaming case
oh no I'm sorry
antique method of getting power supply
with a Rio Toro Oh CR 1280 case reviewed
last time on awesome hardware if you're
pimping it out but let's make this even
more awesome okay um the clear stripper
fans have to go got the stripper fans up
here stripper fans are a no-go
wait we already reviewed this one this
does look vaguely familiar did we what
he said it we reviewed last time I don't
know if then should be not so talk about
it this does look vaguely familiar
right right vaguely familiar i alright
twist twist eNOS of the tubing here for
the Aleman cooler oh yeah now that you
mentioned they have the twist eNOS
you've got some cable extensions that
look fairly clean for the 24 pin but not
quite as good for the 8 pin up here it
looks like it's pinched at the top for
some reason a few straight cables coming
from the the cooler here as well as this
USB one that's just kind of trailing on
down through that area that doesn't look
that nice finding a way to reroute that
would be a good a good idea same thing
for the fan cable down here
and get matching extensions to go for
your graphics card as well as the
motherboard power supply cable
extensions and finally get a memory that
matches that's red
rather than blue and yes and you'll be
in better shape I agree with everything
Paul said yay thanks Nate mmm grinning
and don't I figured out how to do the
open image and new tab thing I'm so
happy about that beautiful my PCI 747 90
MSI Aero
ITX GTX 1070 16 gigs of Crucial
Ballistix sport gigabyte z97 gaming 7
motherboard um so it's like you've got a
black and red theme going on here I
would remove the power supply sticker
cuz that never looks all that great and
you've also got a stock intel cooler I'm
not sure if you were planning to replace
that in the future but I would
definitely look into upgrading that
because I'll be cooler it'll be quieter
and it'll look nicer it's like a really
easy upgrade that'll improve three huge
pillars of your system like how there's
two pictures that are just slightly off
angles like these are the two pictures
that encase it in case you have a head
head tilt now here's here's a situation
where like I don't want to tell you to
go and sell your graphics card because
graphics cards are really overpriced
right now and sell your graphics card
but this is an ITX graphics card in a
full-size case oh yeah that's a huge
case so if you got a good deal on it at
the time or something like that like no
blame at all it's fine
you got a functional graphics card but
you all I'm saying is you've got a lot
more space here you could deal with a
larger cooler and possibly a graphics
card maybe even have the same exact GPU
basis as this one but that's just better
cool there could overclock a little bit
more or something like that right but I
will only bother with something like
that if you can get something that's the
same price sure so yeah phocion beyond
that everything Cal said yep all right
I'm right the two pictures thanks ready
ken ken finally we have Ken with a real
box I 770 700 kg T X 1080
32 gigs of Ripjaws for 480 gig intel
540's SSD gigabyte z2 70 XP sli
motherboard it rips anything well it's a
UFO at user benchmark calm LOL alright
looks like we've got a fractal design
our for maybe an hour 5 with that big
owl not to it kula um obviously the nock
to a cooler is the gets the short stick
here in terms of with that aesthetics
because of that fan but there's not much
you can do about that other than maybe
well repainting or replacing the fan
there is and there is stuff that could
be done with a knock to a fairness stuff
that could be done like for instance get
a black knock this fan you've got you've
got two fans and yeah I'm just realizing
this this fan is not the stock fan that
came with this no no this one 40s yeah
that looks like he must have put it
somewhere else or looks like a 120
that's been wedged under there somehow
that's interesting yeah point being both
of these fans have been rotated to such
an angle that their cables are coming
out at the top and on the outer point
right here you could rotate these yeah
maybe the green to the back of the case
the cables coming out at the back and
that will help you hide or tuck back
behind this cable grommet much of this
ugly cable length here also then just
seems to be a general lack of pulling
back of loose cables that notion of top
left and we've got some more examples
back here I mean these cables are going
where they need to go they're just
they're not really tied down or that
kind of thing very much right so that's
pretty much needed across the entire
build I would also remove that whole
drive cage that has four empty drive
here you can do that just so that you
have yeah just so you have a little bit
more airflow going to your your card yep
it's good yeah everything else looks
pretty solid so yeah well done Ken thank
you Ken and thus concludes hit my PC
thank you to everyone who submitted
today let's move on to some general tech
news starting with some asshole
smugglers
who used drones ingeniously to sneak
eighty million dollars worth of phones
into China well isn't this interesting
this is from and gadget and 2620 this is
a big operation 26 suspects were
arrested 26 people were arrested for
using drones to string two cables
between Shenzhen and southern China and
Hong Kong huh
so they were just trying to use drones
to string a couple cables of the they
can have like a little pulley system and
transport 15,000 phones per night every
day 15,000 phones per day across these
strings these cables that were
apparently brought across by drones and
this is actually the first known case in
China to have employed drones as a part
of their smuggling arrangement
technology that's a lot of phones man
that's uh they've been accused of
smuggling 500 million yuan or
approximately 80 million dollars u.s.
worth of smartphones with the help of
these drones right and now they've been
caught and so they fucked up it was
unsuccessful heist and maybe next time
they should I don't know
buy quieter drones is that how they were
caught where the drones too much doesn't
say but I would imagine like meaning you
know security is just like China like
what the fuck is that
that's a loud ass drone it's got LEDs on
it and shit why are you using the DJI
phantom4
or if you're just some red and green
LEDs on everything cables between
Shenzhen and and Hong Kong then like did
did a boat run into it or something like
that like where the cables maybe it was
like a Bellini on the ocean or were they
where the cables in the water clear no I
I I'm guessing the cables were you know
airborne we're like you know pulled taut
there's someone on the other side to
receive the drone with the cable that it
brought
and was able to pull it taut and they
were just you know so you man sporty are
you're imagining a cable going like
hanging right to keep five or six feet
above like the chowder's waters of the
waterway between shenzhen and hong kong
right and then and then across this line
there's just like every foot or so
there's like a phone and they're just
kind of slowly like moving along the
line somehow I don't know like look
that's the question is the visual I get
I don't know if it's like one phone
every foot or something like that and
there's a guy just pulling it like a
pulley or maybe it's like a pulley and
it's just like a couple boxes like a box
of phones yeah that they're just like
you know like them we're shipping like a
hundred boxes because I can't imagine
probably box it probably boxes you're
probably gonna resell the phone how are
you gonna individually phones are
probably packaged are you gonna engage
in here is a visual the visual I got
there of the lines hanging from it
probably not very realistic that's that
you're talking to me maybe like a hot
dog and yet and I'm I'm kind of kind of
digging that I'm kind of enamored kind
of enamored with that idea now that's
how I would smoke China well you know
what maybe you should have been a part
of them 26 people who got arrested Paul
well I wouldn't have been maybe maybe
they wouldn't have been arrested had you
been there
I don't expose myself like that that's
right I hope you don't expose yourself
to anyone
Hado Rison v 2600 has been deleted by
der bauer dude Wow hey he delivers shit
look at that that's a picture of him
deleting it all right it's very exciting
um he heated up the IHS on the processor
to 180 degrees because that is the
temperature at which India melts which
is the the solder material that AMD uses
for these processors so once he heated
it up he was able to pop off the IHS oh
yeah oh yeah right there he was able to
pop off the IHS that temperature and he
replaced the original solder with a
high-performance Tim material thermal
interface material Tim materials
redundant a high-performance Tim or
thermal interface material and then he
then mounted it crackin X 62 on to the
CPU once it had been deleted and he
overclocked the course to 4.1 gigahertz
at one point three five volts versus the
chips three point four gigahertz base
clock and what he found in a run of
Cinebench r15 was that the deleted 2600
dropped just four degrees from its non
deleted equivalent so it went from 64 C
to 60 C which is not the biggest deal it
drop we've seen in history recent
history so um in the video that you know
devourer makes and stuff he says you
know maybe it's not worth deleting these
second gen rise in CPUs for just a few
measly degrees difference because you
could potentially damage your CPU while
attempting to deal it it's a risky
process that you know as d-lighting
becomes more popular a lot of people
start to forget those risks those very
real risks of actually damaging your
hardware which could be very
traumatizing and costly so for a couple
degrees the bauer wouldn't recommend it
but it's also sort of a sort of a like a
good job goldstar to AMD in the fact
that they're already using a pretty good
solder material for their core um
they're like you know what I mean like
they're doing a pretty good job with the
stock sort of material the solder for
cooling these CPUs whereas Intel would
be a completely different story like go
ahead and deal it that shit you'll drop
you know 15 20 degrees or whatever
because the stock Tim on Intel CPUs is
just really really weak and easily so
good job AMD thanks to Bauer for
investigating this topic further and
that's that's pretty much that
and Paul's back from his
this is his duty wasn't a duty just a
peek
okay just two key break other duty now
we can move on to our next story our to
cover this sari to cover this it's all
great was it better we're better but
slightly not worth the D lid I really
dropped four degrees because the AMD
solder is already pretty good money I'm
like I'm like they didn't they did make
a slide about it they were like to me
her slide yeah they're like look we
soldered we soldered our our stuff not
like those crappy intel there's some
crappy Timmy's Tim plebs
moving on this article's I found this on
reddit apparently using a stock or using
a non stock cooler on your rising CPU
will void its warranty so if you click
on that link it'll take you to the sort
of full thread page on AMD's website is
the warranty for my AMD processor in a
box still valid if I use a different
heat sink or fan other than the one
provided and they're like no the limited
warranty she'll be null and void if the
AMD processor which is the subject of
the limited warranty is used with any
heatsink or fan other than the one
provided in the processor in the box so
this is news to a lot of us and I guess
I kind of want to talk about like hold
on has this problem they solved um no I
don't think it has I would like some
further explanation how difficult or
easy was to follow the instructions on
this page somewhat difficult or very
difficult because we would like more
information I feel like that was a very
don't bother to advertise unlocked
processors overclocked overclockable
CPUs exactly if you're going to
invalidate the warranty from doing so I
think that's a very good point Paul is
that AMD has very heavily been pushing
the fact that all of their CPUs on the
m4 platform are overclockable but what
good is that if they're also gonna come
back and say oh yeah but if you do that
we're gonna void your warranty and we're
not gonna cover you we're gonna
advertise this feature but we're not
gonna protect you from using it or
utilizing it so yeah it's a dick move
I agree one of the other responses on
the forum said my 1600 ex didn't come
with the heatsink so this article is
literally instructing me to run without
a cooler under under a federally illegal
threat to void the warranty which is
also true there's also like I think it's
silly so there's there's something with
warranties like a company can write up
whatever warranty they wants and say
yeah thank you
boy did your warranty if you do this and
this looked at stuff yeah but there are
also there are also I believe federal
and state regulations that protect
consumers from certain actions by
companies right I know there's something
called the limited warranties of
merchantability and fitness which say
that's any product that sold as a new
product basically needs to operate for
the use it was intended to use otherwise
the seller of that product must provide
either replacement of the product or a
refund with the door within 30 days sure
that's that's pretty standard across the
board right you can't buy a car and then
like the car doesn't drive like that's
that's what the car is supposed to do
like so there's a certain basic level of
functionality that's that's promised
based on what the product is right and
if it doesn't work for that purpose then
you have a basic consumer warranty
protection at least if you're in the
United States I don't know right how
that operates in other countries so yeah
I'm sure there's some limitation to this
but there's also the flip side of that
which is from the company's perspective
businesses and this is applies to
manufacturers it applies to retailers
businesses will often make a statement
so that that statement is there
even though they're not really planning
on ever having to use that statement
right it can operate as a deterrent for
people who might be like I don't know
what to do so I'm gonna ask this and
then I'll I'll make the decision based
on that or it can be just something that
they say as a deterrence but if somebody
were to actually come and try to legally
press them on that then they would be
like actually no I'll go ahead and do
that it allows them to for instance
handle returns on a case-by-case basis
whereas the there's a general policy
that applies to everything but there's
also for those people who actually might
need to go around that policy they can
make a case-by-case decision on that for
them and different companies handled
that different ways and I don't know if
AMD's handling that this way all I have
to say about this is like I feel like
I've seen stuff like this before and
I've probably never have seen someone
who's like I bought a 2600 X and I
installed it with with and then I
upgraded the heatsink and then I tried
to RMA it and the name D shut me down
like the chant like the same with
overclocking the niche number of people
the few number of people that will
happen to AMD will probably just take
care of right so and and this doesn't
necessarily hold indicative of AMD's
statement it might just be one guy who's
in charge of responding to that threat
right so I feel like there could be some
further investigation it might not be
super inclusive with everything AMD
stands for or with what they feel or
believe on this particular topic
but but but I definitely also feel like
you know we overclocking your CPU for a
lot of different products has been avoid
or interior and I don't really hear a
lot of people expressing concern that
they've had issues arming or exchanging
their processors that they've
overclocked because at the end of the
day like how how could AMD or any
company really verify that you've used
an on stock cooler with their products
yeah you mean like how in a practical
way for them to
it's even harder to do it with that I
think than overclocking and my thumb to
my knowledge like so for example if you
talk about overclocking and like Intel's
warranty for example if you look at the
actual text of it if you overclock an
Intel processor I believe they're there
there might be newer text on this or
whatever but I believe even though even
the unlocked ones even the case cues
somewhat covered if you overclock it
technically you are not covered under
warranty anymore but to my knowledge
there's no practical means of Intel or
AMD validating that I don't think there
is any flag or some sort of writable
portion of the processor that can get
updated that says this processor has
been run at a higher frequency or
something like that yeah I don't think
there's any practical way of them doing
that so unless you as a user go and say
here's exactly what I did yeah and then
they decide that based on that they
should somehow use what you told them to
void your warranty which I don't see
them doing either no so III I don't see
this affecting people directly right but
if it is something that comes up that
people are seeing as a concerning thing
and hey if anyone from AMD happens to be
watching this is a reference to a post
on there AMD assist directly on the AMD
QA and sometimes on the AMD say right
yeah so it's directly on the Hamdi site
about is the warrant that's on their FAQ
right on the driver and support search
FAQ this question exists yeah so Andy
maybe updating this with some softer
language yeah or just something that
indicates like hey it's not just not a
flat no exactly but my some gray areas
helpful for people so yeah for sure
alright we'll see if there's anything
more to this in the future we'll keep an
eye on it but finally we have an article
from ARS technica ARS technica that's
about the Xbox one we getting 120 Hertz
support perhaps in a May software update
that's kind of exciting for all you
console console goers on the Xbox
one s or Xbox one X Microsoft has
announced this officially that 120 Hertz
will arrive in a software update come
May which will prove to give gamers
smoother gameplay and responsiveness
very similar to what you might
experience on a PC free sync - I should
mention was added to the platform
earlier this year thank you Paul
along with 1440p resolution support so
it seems that Microsoft is trying to
push the Xbox one S or X as a good PC
desktop alternative and I think this is
kind of interesting because I feel like
as we come along here in society and
gaming in the gaming community that a
lot of more a lot more people are
hooking up their their consoles to
monitors as opposed to TVs which
definitely splits the community a bit
because there are certain expectations
that you might have with a gaming
centric monitor versus a generic you
know Finnish good home TV or something
like that so I definitely feel like
Microsoft is acting on this this trend
or this behavior this new this new
action so freesync - we've got 1440p now
120 Hertz is gonna come around now bear
in mind though that 120 Hertz on these
consoles will only be supported at 1080p
and 1440p resolution because these Xbox
is for the current generation only have
hdmi 2.0 so it's the limitation of of
that particular spec that protocol
there's also a bit of limitation as in
the actual graphic graphics processing
exactly how would you even get 120 FPS
at 4k on something like an Xbox that's
running you know some sort of specially
AMD APU game with like 5 textures and
yeah I mean if you're polish if you're
playing an old enough game then sure you
can play at a really high resolution
mm-hmm like remember I on my half we
showed some quick - gameplay about that
yeah that would be my Xbox could easily
handle quick - sure sure at 120 but yeah
but not like you know destiny - or so
thing like that like you know any mean
like it's gonna be a long shot for
certain titles that are a little more
recent and it's also worth bringing up
that a hundred and twenty Hertz just
because it's supported on the console in
general as the platform doesn't mean
that every game you buy from now on on
this platform is going to support a
hundred twenty Hertz this is something
inherently dependent on the developers
of the game to implement into their
titles to support and play nicely with
the consoles so and that's not to say
that games that are already out that
have not been optimized for 120 Hertz
will never see 120 Hertz gameplay it's
possible that there could be future
updates or you know patches for existing
titles that will allow 120 Hertz but you
want to keep your eyes on this if you
are an Xbox one s or x-gamer to any in
any capacity you want to make sure that
you know that the games you're getting
are supporting 120 Hertz if that's
something that you're interested in and
also bear in mind that you won't be able
to get 4k out of that so that's what's
happening with the Xbox and that's
pretty much all the things I have to
talk about in my half so let's just jaws
dive in some donations as damaged as
downs nice nice and to just continue
your sentence I know I mean I'm just
trying to get through this man only
vaguely it's okay people understand my
drunken language by now Carlos 1970 $10
hi Paul and Kyle great show I just got a
2700 X on B 350 and when I run a 264 the
CPU temps are between 68 and 78 C but
something called CPU diode reads 120
plus should I be worried Thanks no no
that's different
no you should not care mos yeah
depending on the motherboard that you're
using motherboards have different
sensors on them a program like I 264
will reach out and try to hook those
sensors usually your your your the the
most fundamental sets of sensors like
your CPU temperature and that kind of
thing are usually pretty functional and
I will sometimes go off of other
readings when it comes like the era
temps and that kind of thing with those
but if something is really that reading
is some really running that hot and it's
not supposed to then your system would
probably shut down versus it just
running at that temperature so it's
probably a miss read from the software I
would also see I would also suggest
getting an aftermarket cooler if you are
getting up to 78 C on the 2700 X because
these chips are inherently clocked
higher than first gen risin and the
coolers themselves the stock coolers are
not that much different
like the wraith prism the real
difference between that and the wraith
max from what I can tell is just the RGB
so you're still getting the same TDP
rated cooler but for maybe a slightly
warmer running chip so I would consider
it especially if you're trying to
overclock and you're getting 78 C maybe
get an aftermarket cooler I was
surprised that the wraith prism uses the
plastic tabs
- yeah secure it felt it felt less it
felt less secure than the other ones
that before the backplate it's also
simpler I think just mounting a simpler
mounting process but four screws than
that yeah it's cook it around and angle
it in there and stuff like know what's
annoying is trying to remove that cooler
when you have a GPU installed the top
slot because sometimes trying to like
angle it to get it off that that the the
bottom yeah wrong is interferes the
cooler just smacks into your GPU it's
kept annoying but thank you very much
for the donation Carlos Nixon we've got
try knocks this once again aiming $5
fine twitter source slash char noxus
underscore gaming to see the build try
noxus underscore gaming if you would
like to see random dude on the
Internet's Belcher knocks the C's
tradoc's disease we cannot guarantee
that you won't see I don't know
midget clown porn or something III don't
know
we haven't vetted this no we have not so
proceed with caution
alright and Juche wire five Canadians
all right if the CPUs dead it's dead
also changed my mind on the Fenix cooler
will probably use the fractal expandable
yeah-yo because it's cheaper yes the
Celsius coolers have been very well
reviewed for the most part and I use
them pretty frequently in builds from
time to time so yeah that's that's
that's a great solution and I don't
think there's any red flags there so
it's got a thicker radiator to the
radiator very nice cable management as
well Jeff Wilkins tender Australia's yo
just picked up the bit with desk met hey
how does it function as a beer coaster
should I be worried about any possible
spillage cheers from star yeah yeah yeah
strike sorry um I have not really tested
it as a beer coaster but you know I've
used these to put drinks on they're
better than putting on our burger so it
dries yeah it doesn't leave much of a
stain no or like a watermark right in my
experience so yeah yeah they were they
were good so coaster approved I didn't
go for it put all your beers on them MB
sixty-seven thirteen dollars and 37
cents as always Kyle I was thinking
about your earlier discussion on being
21 years old and wanted to say that both
you and Paul are still kids to enjoy
life 21 for me 88 was during the Reagan
private presidency see that that means
nothing to me like for me 88 was just I
mean I wasn't conscious really I was a
baby as an infant and then maybe like 92
was like that the only thing that night
like 1992 means to me is is Nintendo NES
it's like I had that place in front of
me the controller put in my hands 92 you
had the original NES yes behind the
curve well I was too young before that I
think video I think 92 is when Super
Nintendo actually came out right but my
dad wanted to start me on the original
roots of gaming consoles so he bought me
an NES and then I scaled up beyond that
eventually but NES was the the first
console I ever played I think it was in
92 yes not been out for a while that
Manti 1940 said that the Super Nintendo
released in 91 yeah so yes I was a
little bit behind the curve but I think
because I was so young that he wanted to
introduce me to a more simplified comps
because you scaled up right from from
the NES to the SNES you had a few more
buttons yeah trigger finger buttons
stuff
so um and and I had the cool aeneas I
had the toploader never the toploader
not the one that just not the original
box that you went in but the one that
was actually a top loader like the top
like like the SNES our original Nintendo
yes for the original SNES was awesome it
was like the compact it was like the
PlayStation Portable version of it
anyway let's move on to Trinity slow and
$5 here's number three Kyle where's the
stack attack video that Paul mentioned
in his 420 vid or am i blind and not
seeing it I just finished editing stack
attack just before we went live for the
show so soon it took me 15 hours to edit
just saying and it is nope I added that
I had all day Monday and I finished it
today it turned out wonderfully and it's
already up live people have already been
watching it on floatplane if you let me
check that out shine a floatplane
description in the youtube link below or
you can wait a week and it'll be up then
on youtube so it's very funny so I need
to be very very funny later this week
yes okay later this week or early next
week mother - Tanner wore them $10 I'm
from Alaska forgot to mention though I
have no other question though going to
build my girlfriend a PC for streaming
what would you upgrade from your budget
build as we have a bigger budget tanner
for streaming right now you definitely
want one of the six core rising CPUs you
can even go with an 8 core rise in CPU
if you have that cache the cache or you
know yeah it's worth it to you but for
right now I would consider a 2600 or
2600 X maybe go with the X actually with
the 2600 because you get a slightly
better CPU cooler or go with the 2600 if
you're planning on getting an
aftermarket CPU cooler as long as you're
okay with voiding your AMD warranty
apparently um we've learned but yeah
yeah definitely streaming and gaming at
the same time this has been tested by
gamers Nexus pretty thoroughly and
they've had
a pretty good testing methodology for
that yeah it's just it's a much better
experience for your viewers yes because
you stream at higher quality yeah you
can scream higher quality and still
maintain a good gameplay experience for
you yeah while you're gaming so consider
that 2,600 2,600 X if you're going for a
6 core or the 2700 or 2700 X if you're
going for an 8 core yes and then of
course you're gonna need to pair that up
with the graphics card and that's
probably gonna be where your biggest
budget hit comes in but just depends on
what you're able to find there get it
get it get one of those one of those
combat boxes they called to get the
combat combat combat crepe might be a
reasonable solution for you yeah you
lose a little bit of performance off the
top ends because you're not doing with
2,000 series from Rison but no it's not
that much so if you need a CPU a
motherboard and graphics card it is a
pretty reasonable price for all those
three things mos def thanks tanner
thank you Matt Baume $5 thanks for the
awesome content cow Paul finished the
damage CPC already we're gonna it Matt
I've made progress perhaps by 2020 we'll
see Paul's HTP Singh in the flat things
don't you think by the time you finally
show you're a CPC all the time to
upgrade it'll be like two generations
old oh maybe you guys are in for more of
a treat than you anticipated they'll
just have to wait five years Dexter two
four three three $5 thanks for the
awesome info and updates on what is
going on in the PC world you are welcome
I'd also suggest watching other tech
shows too they might deliver the news
more coherently than we do but I'm glad
we're entertaining that way or at least
all the information you need no you can
be confined right here that's right so
you need thomas Lukens $5 if i send you
guys the best
root beer ever will you drink it during
awesome hardware yes it is beer after
all yes I love root beer I love your
beer you guys want to send us stuff or
pío boxes are listed in the description
of our videos my music mines on my video
calluses on cows videos yep just for
nude my peel box actually I thought you
just said they said just for nudes I've
renewed renewed it put your peel my big
money says just for nudes I just renewed
got it renewed like re and nudie that's
aa mister induct Steven hill Steven $10
so we went from wired phones to wireless
phones and now we're back to having
telephone lines I just paid ten bucks to
make a bad joke what is my life to come
to Cheers Steven he's talking about the
Shana thing yep I believe so it's a
telephone line telephone line Steven
your bad jokes are always welcome here
yeah
we won't fault you for him because we
make them on the Reg l Abraham $5 what's
up guys what the f is up with hotline
also your recommendation for an e mount
macro lens hotline is I haven't really
touched it to be honest since the leak
it's just sitting there but I have
uploaded a I have posted an update video
as to exactly what happened and walking
everyone through my exact experience of
discovering it and and what happened as
far as how everything went so
ballistically wrong that's on flip lane
right now there's probably six videos on
floatplane right now that you have not
seen on YouTube really yes wow we're
pretty ahead of schedule right now
usually not quite literally it's usually
not like that but that is also one of
the videos so you can check that out
description below JC p JC MP technology
services $5 Kyle only gets five dollars
because he gets my floatplane money
speak of the devil well I guess I guess
I need to get on that flute plane I'm
cool with that that float plane train
that float plane plane
hop on the plane wagon I wanna hop on
the plane wagon I'll start talking about
the floatplane train though because I
think that would be fun
oh plane train imagining every way
everyone can train everyone get on the
floatplane train yeah why not
early adopters that's what I'm saying
fuck yeah
Rick Sanchez Rick Sanchez five-year or
Gbps sorry didn't mean to confuse the
two does FX and Sandy Bridge have any
life left or are we all going to have to
bite the bullet and buy a new board and
CPU its mem something very memory costs
memory cost that kills me yes you're
gonna bite the bullet bro I'd say Sandy
Bridge has a little bit more life than
FX or sure overclocking if you can get
your Sandy Bridge around four point four
four point five gigahertz yeah it's
still pretty reasonably good yeah but
you know all your days are numbered
though all these processors and stuff
this is the computer you put together
now in four or five six years we'll
reach a point where it is no longer
functional for the things that we want
to do with it right now right and that's
a good thing we we must remember this is
a good thing if the tasks that we use
our computers for didn't continually
become more difficult for the computers
to do then there would be no reason for
the manufacturers to make new products
to build the computers and we would not
have this continual cycle of new
computer parts to build to do fancy new
things and all that kind of stuff just
that's true this is a give and take yes
you need to buy a new stuff every so
often but that new stuff can do new and
fancier things that the older stuff
could do right and often it's a pretty
huge jump especially if you're waiting
five six years per upgrade cycles so
yeah you will find if you're upgrading
from an FX series AMD processor or a
Sandy Bridge Intel processor and you
jump to current generation you'll be
like wow I didn't think it was gonna be
this much of a difference in my
experience but but it is especially if
you go from like if you upgrade to like
an SSD as well and all that kind of
stuff ok yeah eventually you have to
bite the bullet but I do not blame you
if at least for right now your
holding off until hopefully middle or
later this year when we will hopefully
see memory prices normalized because
yeah hopefully by the end of this year
it's still pretty expensive and those
are one of those commodity markets that
a band flow and we've been on a ab for
what I don't know which I don't know
what just way to switch but it's been
really expensive for a while so it
should hopefully dip back down at some
point yeah all right so those are all
the donations we do have some Johnson's
shout out starting with Justin H thank
you very much for picking up a bit with
overclocked mug I love you
Nathaniel to be from Utah a Johnson for
you got the Star Wars RGB everything
shirts oh I'm sorry that was a mug
there's a mug okay Star Wars are to be
everything mug I'll forgive you and the
stainless steel thumb screw bottle open
Nathaniel gets a double Johnson for also
picking up the rip gamepad shirt and a
fidget spinner sexy hell yeah
Eric s from North Carolina hey Johnson
to you for picking up that thumb screw
beer set the glass and the opener mr.
Jack picked up a bit with gaming desk
Matt again one of my favorites thank you
very much sir Johnson Johnson and
finally James or Jay Kay from Illinois
or Florida
Illinois wherever you're from I got a
James - James Illinois or Florida Oh huh
it's all right where I always go for the
build where I think whoever's paying for
it
whatever is paying for it wherever
you're from Jay thank you for your order
he got a couple English pub glasses from
me James you got an RGB everything shirt
awesome hardware I think yes lovely and
then come we're here been picking up a
desk Matt Johnson - you
and Brandon gets a Johnson finally
forgetting a words in a circle 20 ounce
tall boy Imperial pint glass yes guys
thank you so much for tuning in this is
episode you know I was walking down the
hall today in my building here and
someone this girl was sitting down
gently cow she goes nice glasses
because I was I was carrying both these
glasses to wash them out for us oh you
got here yeah I was walking and she's
like nice glasses and I thought
immediately like she must really like
Michael I was thinking he was talking
about these glasses I was like oh thanks
and then like as I was watching about
that I think I was like he was talking
about these glasses okay here I
discovered now I'm most self-conscious
about these glass I discovered a cool
thing that you can do with Kyle's
glasses you did it's they're the they're
they're shaped kind of like it can't a
boy can so if you're pouring a can of
beer into one of these you can actually
go completely inverted yep and leave it
there and just I'll sit there yep and
they'll just do a self pour that's a
feature yep
totally on purpose by design you know
outside the box but that is pretty much
it guys we do have a rage shout out
don't we theoretically possible cease
from femme à voir then underscore Ivoire
I wish I knew how to pronounce that
properly but I'm gonna go there right
now and see she is currently streaming
The Legend of Zelda breath of the wild
and she has 45 viewers if we can turn
that into 450 we may very well see her
mind blown look into pieces on stream
this is who we are this is who we are
reading yet we're about to raid the shit
out of this girl okay so please blow the
shit out of FEM underscore Eve wha IV o
ir e you can go there now look she's
already getting awesome harder raids oh
do it do it do it do it do it thanks for
watching this episode guys do time
stamps for if you want
it's on YouTube timestamps would be very
much appreciated thank you in advance
and I love you Oh Oh we'll see you guys
next week bye guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
