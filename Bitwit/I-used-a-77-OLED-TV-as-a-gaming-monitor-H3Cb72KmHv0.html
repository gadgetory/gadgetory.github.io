their c9 their OLED for kc9 TV this is
the successor to their very popular
c8 model from 2018 this is the new 2019
model and there's already been a lot of
content floating around the internet
about this TV and how it performs for
home here purposes watching movies and
you know Netflix streaming and all that
sort of thing but today I'm gonna
specifically focus on gaming content and
what it's like to game on this behemoth
of a TV for years there's been a growing
interest in gaming in the living room
where from a couch whether it be on a
console or PC today I'm gonna mainly
focus on PC gaming because that's kind
of what we're mostly about here on the
channel but I'll also touch on some
console details as well the LG OLED c9
is a 4k native 120 Hertz refresh rate
display it can do both of those specs
simultaneously over its single HDMI 2.14
it's got a couple other HDMI 2.0 ports
as well but the 2.1 is a new addition on
the c9 that was not available on the c 8
well this is super exciting at first
glance unfortunately you can't actually
utilize that on a PC because the current
generation of r-tx graphics cards from
Nvidia and even the RX Vega GPUs from
AMD do not support 4k 120 Hertz over
HDMI 2.1 they only support it over there
DisplayPort 1.4 connection which is a
port that the TV completely lacks
display ports just not very common on
TVs I wish that would change very soon
what this means is even a high-end
gaming PC can only game on this TV at a
maximum of 4k 60 Hertz or 1440p 120
Hertz and that's over the HDMI 2.0 B
connection that both of those video card
families have unfortunately AMD's
upcoming rx 5700 series GPUs are also
not going to be getting an HDMI 2.1
treatment from the looks of it they're
gonna be using a very similar display
controller as the RX Vega series so that
kind of sucks doubling down on the bad
news the LG c9 also lacks any kind of
free sync support although it does have
HDMI vrr variable refresh rate that is
an HDMI form spec that is similar to
free sync but it's not free sync and it
doesn't currently work with any pcs in
fact as of now at the time of filming
the only device that can really let
this technology with this display is the
Xbox one and yes the Xbox one only has
an hdmi 2.0 port but early last year
there was a software update that allowed
that port to take advantage of certain
limited hdmi 2.1 features such as hdmi
vrr and free sink of course while it's
not listed on the manufacturers page
i've seen several articles pointing out
that the refresh rate range is 40 to 120
Hertz with hdmi brr which isn't great at
least on the low end but it's better
than nothing what's kind of frustrating
is that the Xbox one doesn't really have
the horsepower to drive most games at
120 FPS at 4k so it seems like kind of a
wasted technology on this platform
however there's the whole streaming and
media consumption thing where if you can
find 4k 120 FPS content for video
playback for example then the platform
is going to support it and that's kind
of cool that being said we should see
HDMI 2.1 in full effect on the next
generation of consoles which will be
more equips to actually push those
boundaries the other feature that hdmi
2.1 brings to the table is a llm or auto
low latency mode which automatically
kicks your TV into its low input lag
state a lot of TVs call this game mode
but it'll automatically kick it into
that mode anytime it detects a
supporting device is being fired up so
it just kind of saves you a couple extra
steps of having to go into your TV
settings and selecting game mode anytime
you want to jump into a game now this
would not be a content piece on OLED
technology without talking about black
levels because right now OLED displays
are the undisputed champ when it comes
to producing the richest purest truest
blacks on the market of course we've got
micro LED technology which is supposed
to offer a lot of the benefits but none
of the the risks of screen burnin that
OLED has however it's still a very new
technology that's very expensive and so
it's gonna be a while until the pricing
on that comes down to be a more
mainstream tech that is truly
competitive with OS but only pixels are
awesome because they each produce and
emit their own light source instead of
relying on a backlight with local
dimming zones like an LED LCD display
does you can independently turn on and
off pixels that are side-by-side right
next to each other so you effectively
have perfect contrast without any kind
of halo effect that's found on other
panel tech if you've never witnessed it
in person it's absolutely jaw-dropping
the first time you see it regardless of
the medium whether it be
TV streaming blu-ray gaming when I was
playing Resident Evil 2 during this test
I was blown away how much more clearly I
could see enemies lurking in the shadows
or darker areas of the environment
because of how phenomenally good the
contrast was another perfect example is
at the cinematography from The Game of
Thrones Battle of Winterfell episode
looks phenomenal
you can actually watch it you can see
everything that's going on in peer
detail it looks so good and it's much
more enjoyable to watch unfortunately it
doesn't do anything to help the writing
this is easily the biggest selling point
of oled displays like the c9 and it's
exactly why people put up with the risks
of burnin because the image quality
looks so much better than anything
they've ever seen previously throwing a
game up on one of these screens looks
infinitely better not just compared to
an LED LCD TV equivalent but even the
most top-of-the-line high-end $1200
curved IPS or VA gaming monitors out
there pale in comparison to how a game
looks on one of these TVs and speaking
of there's another big trick up the c9
sleeve that current high-end gaming
monitors just don't have and that is
true HDR support I mean we've got
support for HDR 10 hlg advanced the HDR
dolby vision all crabbed into this
beautiful unit to deliver true HD our
experiences and images not like the HDR
400 specs that you see on gaming
monitors that quite frankly looks like
garbage most of the time now there's a
bit of a caveat here in the sense that
HDR comes at a cost of additional
bandwidth bandwidth that we have a
limited amount of over our HDMI 2.0 B
connection which is about 18 gigabits
per second after fiddling around with
the settings in a video control panel I
was able to get HDR working in Windows
10 at 4k 60 Hertz 12 bit with 4 to 0
chroma subsampling now bear in mind you
can crank any of these settings up and
down to your heart's content as long as
you're staying within the bandwidth
limitations so for a faster gaming
experience I was able to get HT are
working at 1080p 120 Hertz with RGB
subsampling at 12 bit color depth a
point of confusion for me here is that
the LG c 9 is a native 10 bit panel yet
there was no tended option in Nvidia
control panel I only have the options
for 8 or 12 bit I'm not exactly sure how
we get to 12 bit with a 10 bit
perhaps there's some dithering going on
here that I don't know about at any rate
I'm not gonna complain about more color
depth so I just took it for what it was
and moved on and I mean just the end
result in action is mind-blowing I mean
look at these before and after
screenshots of Shadow the Tomb Raider
which is an officially HDR supported
game absolutely stunning the images kind
of speak for themselves there was a
breathtaking improvement here that that
extended the reach of the highlights and
the shadows and the colors just across
the whole spectrum it really gave life
to the environment and it just makes the
image pop it's pure ecstasy for your
eyes it should be outlawed the results
in battlefield 5 which also supports the
HDR were equally awesome however there
was a capturing issue or any time I
tried to capture the gameplay with OBS
or xsplit or even do a print screen the
outputted file did not look anything
like what I was seeing on screen and my
wife confirmed bitch he's like nope
there's something wrong so the best I
could do is point a camera at it and
show you guys that way but I know that's
kind of useless so sorry about that but
rest assured the dynamic range was
vastly improved and what I noticed in
battlefield 5 specifically is that
objects that are supposed to be bright
are bright looking you look directly
into the Sun or the street lamps that's
you know reflecting light off of the
snow it's actually bright you kind of
have to squint a little bit so you're
really getting a broader sense not just
of colors but of like peak luminance and
everything coming together just looks so
much nicer and and much more immersive
now if you're a serious gamer you're
probably not just interested in how the
panel looks but how fast it is as well
unfortunately the pixels on this OLED
display are incredibly fast our teams
found that a 100 percent color to color
transition took 2.4 milliseconds that's
really really good even for a gaming
monitor not just by TV standards what
this super fast pixel motion response
translates to is effectively zero
perceptible motion blur it doesn't
matter if I was dancing around like a
monkey in Doom or doing 360 noscopes or
trying to in a game like csgo everything
was completely sharp no motion blur
whatsoever it's awesome input lag which
is something a lot of TVs suffer from
Granite's been getting better with low
input lag states like game mode and such
the input lag here is equally impressive
again these numbers are from our tanks
comm we have 13 milliseconds at 4k 60
Hertz and just 6 to 7 milliseconds
whether you're
yep 1080p or 1440p at a hundred and
twenty Hertz the gaming experience at 4k
60 Hertz is plenty fast for my needs
it's gonna be more than adequate for the
majority of gamers the super responsive
however if you're privy to even more
speed lowering the resolution say the
1440p so you can up the refresh rate to
120 Hertz makes this thing in absolute
animal it is so fast at 120 Hertz this
thing rivals the most high-end
sought-after gaming monitors tailored
for speed that are on the market here in
2019 it's it's ridiculous how fast this
display is plus you're getting those
inky black contrast levels and that true
HDR support altogether this is the best
gaming display that you can put inside
your living room but to be fair let's
address the the number one reason why
most people might say not to game on an
OLED display screen burnin which is
basically permanent image retention it's
the infamous Achilles heel of OLED
panels and this can be caused from
having the same static image on screen
for really long periods of time and
eventually that static image will leave
a ghosting residue of sorts that will
permanently be baked into the screen
some examples of this might be like a TV
network logo that's wedged into the
corner of the screen it's just sitting
there
or on the gaming side I always imagine
like a HUD like an in-game HUD whether
it be a mini-map or whatever else are
Tings found that just four to five
thousand hours of a static image being
shown on screen was enough to cause
burnin but you have to bear in mind that
these are extreme use case scenarios for
our team's testing they actually had the
same static image on screen for 20 hours
a day for days on end until it racked up
about 4 to 5 thousand hours however many
days that that translates to so unless
you fall under that extreme use case
scenario most users are gonna be
completely fine and safe from screen
burnin especially because there's a lot
more technology built into these TVs now
manufacturers like LG and Sony have
integrated new technologies to help
alleviate and prevent burnin from
happening but I think the biggest
defense against the screen burnin in my
opinion is mindful usage if you're
mindful and conscientious of how you're
using your TV making sure not to let any
logos or static images on screen for too
long that's really the best preventative
you can take to avoiding burnin
altogether one example on the gaming
side is that if you play a title with a
static HUD you might be able to go into
the game settings and adjust the
brightness or the opacity of said HUD or
remove it entirely if you don't
absolutely need it and this would
obviously help eliminate any possibility
of screen burnin occurring from that
particular object when it comes down to
it burnin is not a myth it's a very real
serious issue but it's also an issue
that only affects a very small
percentage of users and if you think you
might be susceptible to burnin because
of your viewing habits then OLED Tech is
probably not for you and you should look
for something else that being said if
you're willing to use your TV with a
degree of caution and be more mindful
with how you use it I firmly believe
that the performance benefits you get in
exchange are very well worth it
again the two major shortcomings of this
TV as a gaming display include the lack
of any variable or fresh trade
technology that's supported on PC which
is understandably a deal-breaker for
some people and the fact that there's
currently no way to game at 4k 120 Hertz
on a PC if that's the spec you're trying
to hit however if you can live with
those compromises I would 110 percent
recommend this display for gaming
there's probably other OLED TVs on the
market that will come close to even
match the OLED C 9 but for the most part
this is it this is the ceiling if you're
trying to game from your couch but
that's it guys let me know what you
think about this thing in the comments
if you have any experiences with OLED
Zoar burnin yourself feel free to let us
know down below and toss a like on this
video if you enjoyed it helps a lot get
subscribed to the channel for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon and I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
