welcome to another fantastic episode of
your autumn sauce news and today I'll be
doing a little bit of a project I should
say it's actually going to be a
three-part video well you know I
actually haven't decided if it's going
to be two parts or three parts but it's
at least going to be two parts I'm
building a new system and this is very
exciting because it's going to be my
personal system that I will be using
personally what's that vibrating but
yeah it's going to be an HTP see so for
those of you who don't know htpc stands
for home theater PC and as many of you
might know from my last video I
mentioned that I am moving I'm going to
be moving into a new place with two
awesome people and we actually managed
to get a house we were debating on
whether or not to get an apartment or a
condo it just worked out to our benefit
to get a house and because of that we
actually have a fairly decently sized
living room and I kind of want to put a
bunch of cool stuff in there I want to
be able to entertain my friends when
they come over and just hang out with my
roommates occasionally in the common
areas so because of that I decided to
finally build an HTTP C which is
something that I've been wanting to do
for a really long time now but since I'm
kind of cooped up in my current room as
it is my current living situation I
never really had a reason to build one
this first part of the video is
basically just me introducing the build
the purpose of it and all of the parts
that will be included and why I decided
to choose those parts the second video
will be a build video where I actually
physically construct the build and you
get to watch the entire process or most
of the process anyway and I still
haven't decided whether I want to do a
time-lapse filled of it or a tutorial
maybe you guys can help me out what
would you like to see me do for the
build itself and if you guys have any
good ideas I might just take your advice
in the third video I'm still debating on
whether or not should even exist it's
either going to be well it's probably
going to be a demonstration just all set
up in my living room in my future living
room so it might not not actually come
for a couple weeks or so but nonetheless
I would like to do some benchmarking on
it and just kind of show you the
physical setup once it's all installed
and ready to go in my new place the cost
of all this of this build is is really
going to be about 1100 bucks and that's
not including Windows 7 which is what
I'm planning on installing it so that's
without the OS it's about a
hundred-dollar bill I think a thousand
1070 $5.25 to be exact so you can
actually check out the parts for the
information stuff if you want to buy the
parts they're in the link in the
description below they're all linking to
Newegg I think for maybe one or two
parts that are discontinued on the
website the link to another site that I
won't mention but aside from that this
is pretty much just going to be a
multimedia heaven or a central hub for
everything media / entertainment so it's
going to be really awesome for video
playback and playing blu-rays streaming
Netflix and all that kind of thing but
also it's going to be able to do some
gaming as well now it's not a pure
gaming powerhouse that isn't the
intention of this build so I don't want
to hear you guys saying $1,100 and you
only got the graphics card because
that's not the point of it it's really
just to to be a really nice kind of
middle ground as far as a multimedia I'm
really excited to share the parts with
you guys so why do we do that now
alright so starting off with the chassis
I decided to go with silver stones sg0 5
and this case is actually been around
for quite some time now but it's still a
really solid case it provides excellent
airflow for beings just small little
chassis it only has one 120 millimeter
fan at the front of it but it is pretty
darn good the only thing is it's a
little bit loud for my liking so I'm
going to be swapping that out for a fan
that I will be talking about momentarily
but more on the case it does some
Ursuline has made some revisions to this
case they actually kind of reinvented it
I wouldn't say reinvented it but they
kind of enhanced it a little bit with
the USB 3.0 USB 3.0 it actually has two
USB 3.0 ports on the front panel so I
can quickly stick a flash drive in there
if I wanted to watch a movie you know
transfer a movie there on a whim it's
really useful and it's just a really
good case it has a ton of ventilation
for being such a small form-factor
chassis and I'm actually really excited
to be building in its because it's just
so darn cute and cubish that a cubic I
should say but yeah so that's that's the
case that's enough of the case and I'll
be talking more about the components
during the build video when I when I
build the computer for the power supply
also the silverstone products this
there s FX series 450 watt fully modular
power supply that's cool but it's sfx
it's a fully modular sfx power supply
which you don't really see too many of
these and granted this does come with a
pretty hefty premium I will say that but
it's it's fully modular and what where
would you want fully modular anymore
than in a mini ITX form factor build
because obviously you're trying to save
space for all that excess cables and
stuff right 80 plus gold certified as
well so this is going to be pretty epic
I can't wait to use this guy it's gonna
just fit so nicely
you know Silverstone power supply
Silverstone chassis it's just going to
be a beautiful marriage in my opinion
aside from that I've also got well
here's the brain of the operation this
is a 35 70 K Core i5 from Intel I will
be doing some overclocking with it just
because well it's unlocked so I should
hit overclocked it right be a shame not
to but I understand this is probably a
little bit more overkill than I need for
a htpc but like I said I will be doing
some gaming on it and I don't know the
cooling the cooling in this chassis is
just going to be so awesome that I
figure I might as well have some some
higher-end components in there that that
are worth cooling so this is really cool
I'm excited to use this guy I know it's
last gen but it's still still kicking
strong and yeah should serve me well in
all of my gaming and media playback
needs as far as the motherboard goes
I've got a and asrock z77
II Mini ITX or I TX board this is
actually a pretty decent board it's
about 140 bucks right now and it
actually comes with built-in Wi-Fi so
actually has those two external Wi-Fi
antennas you can just place wherever to
get better reception and this is gonna
be really useful because I'm pretty sure
not going to have a landline or I'm
sorry like an Ethernet cable that's long
enough to reach from the living room to
wherever the router might be so this is
just nice to have Wi-Fi as an option I
could always you know hardwire it in
later if I so desire and I'm really to
use the Wi-Fi but it is nice to have
that option
moving on let's see what component
should I use next memory let's go to the
memory and makes the most logical sense
these are 2 4 gig dims these are Crucial
Ballistix sport edition of memory these
are ddr3 240 pin of course and they're
clocked at 1600 mega transfers per
second now I looked at the reviews of
this kit online on Newegg actually and
it just got a lot of hate but I realized
after doing some research that people
were only only people that had AMD
builds we're having issues with these
sticks and Grenda there's always that
chance that you're going to get a kick
do a no matter what platform you're
running but crucial admitted themselves
if there was some compatibility issues
with their memory sticks these ones in
particular and AMD systems so hopefully
I don't run into any issues with these
guys they look pretty solved they're
also extremely low profile if you've
ever seen some ridiculously low profile
dims these are probably the ones you can
just put you can barely see them when
they're installed so these should also
be pretty pretty sweet and makes a lot
of sense to use it a kit like this in
the build like the one I'm building
aside from that oh this is cool this is
a CPU cooler heatsink this is a Samuel
17 from prolimatech probe no I'm sorry
yeah it is prolene attack I've actually
never used prolene detect product before
but this had really good reviews online
I actually first saw this heatsink in a
build on overclock net I was in the
BitFenix prodigy owners club or whatever
and I saw some dude with really sick
looking build in a white prodigy and he
was using this cool and I just it just
caught my eye was like what cooler is
that I need to find out luckily he had
he had specified which one it was
it was the Samuel 17 and it's gotten
really good reviews on new egg as well
so I also like the fact that it's just
it's just the heatsink so I can include
whatever fan I want on it
and have a little bit more control there
the fans for actually which I should
talk about now I don't have on me right
now they're still being shipped you can
do a little hand dance while I talk
they're still being shipped to me there
on their way there are two gelid fans
they are kind of a happy medium actually
between air flow as well as static
pressure so I'm going to have one of
them on that heat sink on the Samuel 17
and the other one is just going to be
replacing that fan on the SG 0-5 case so
I'm going to go for a little quieter fan
I think these gelid spin at 1500 rpm
they are PWM I believe and they've also
gotten really good reviews so gonna be
excited to swap those out and see how
they perform moving under the video card
now this is probably all what you guys
are wondering I just care about the
video good nothing else matters I'm
going with the EVGA GeForce GTX 650 Ti
boost this is the super clock edition it
is also 2 gig has 2 gig frame buffer so
it should be able to handle most 1080p
gaming with a lot of triple-a titles
definitely not going to be anything
close to what my 670 is doing right now
in my full desktop tower but like I said
this isn't a peer gaming machine it's
not intended to just rip the crap out of
every game I throw at it
it's just intended to you know have fun
and be able to play some casual
kickback games with some friends every
now and then in the living room so I
think this thing will suit mean really
well for this build if you actually want
to see some more benchmarks on the 650
TI boost reference design actually did a
video of that a while back a couple
months ago I actually even did a two-way
SLI benchmarks with this guy so keep in
mind it was the reference though so this
will have a little bit of a performance
increase because it is factory
overclocked I also want to mention that
it is a you know typical EVGA reference
style cooler so it is a blower style fan
all the air is going to be ejected out
back which I felt was a good choice
considering the chassis and the form
factor that I mean that I'm using and
I'm almost done here and most wrapped up
let's go with the SSD so this is the SSD
this is actually the same model of SSD
I'm giving away this isn't the same SSD
am giving away totally two different
different SSDs am I going to use this
thing for a month and then give to you
guys use but this is the Plextor m5 pro
256 gig SATA 3 drive it is a pretty
pretty beastly Drive and it's going to
suit my needs because I don't know I
feel like 256 gigs is a nice happy
medium as
easily be getting cheaper lately so I
was gonna go with 128 I was like yeah
you know what screw it let's just let's
just upgrade and have a little bit more
space than we need to but it's always
good to have more and not need it versus
the other way around so really good
Drive and also yeah I just didn't want
to opt for a mechanical Drive at all
just because I feel this is enough space
I'm probably do a lot more streaming
than actual downloading but yeah this is
also going to make the system a little
bit quieter as well as a little bit it's
going to free up some room not having a
massive three and a half inch mechanical
drive in there and lastly this I don't
know why maybe it sound like a drum roll
or something it's just a slim optical
drive this is LG's it's a blu-ray combo
Drive basically I don't think it writes
blu-rays it is a DVD combo Drive however
and it does read blu-rays so this is
going to be pretty vital to my htpc
because I do have a small blu-ray
collection and I do still like optical
media as far as when it comes to movies
and stuff it's just it's really nice I
like having a physical copy of a disc
sometimes just being able to pop it in
and watch it not have to worry about any
codecs or anything like that it's all
just good to go right when I want it so
this is a really nice Drive it's slim
once again I don't know if I mentioned
this but sg0 5 only accepts a slim form
factor optical drive so yes they are a
bit pricier but actually not by much if
you're just going to get like a regular
form factor optical drive into blu-ray
blu-ray player it's really not going to
be that much cheaper so and you know
optical drives aren't for everybody but
for my purposes and this HTPC definitely
wanted one of these guys so I think
that's pretty much it I'm going to just
close the video out like this because
I'm too lazy to set up the tripod and
all this stuff how's the framing too
lazy self a tripod and all that stuff
but they're all the parts for this build
I hope you guys enjoyed it and I hope
you guys are excited and looking forward
to the actual build video leave your
comments in the section below and give
me some advice on what to do for the
next video particularly the build so
thank you all for watching and Kyle
awesomesauce news and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
