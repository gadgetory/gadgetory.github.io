it's actually happening guys it's
actually happening me hmm
good morning good morning good morning
welcome welcome today's vlog is going to
be sort of a mixed bag of things because
I have a lot of stuff to prepare before
I hop on a plane tonight for Taiwan in
order to cover Computex 2017 for you
guys which I'll be bringing a bunch of
coverage on the channel in just a week
or so so there's a lot of things that
need to happen starting first first of
all my hair is a little messy 8 a.m.
right now is just what it looks like at
this time of the day but you know what
for being awake for only 15 minutes or
so
I was pretty shitty actually yeah pretty
good but that is besides the point
ladies and gentleman because the first
task on today's agenda is prepping the
$2,000
Rison gaming rig giveaway PC I just want
to give away on this thing about a week
ago you can go check it out in the car
here I'll put a link to the description
you can still enter to win this $2,000
system on it's featuring arisin 7 1800 x
and an asus strix OSI model GTX 1080p
eye with a bunch of other loaded specs
so Internet but the reason why we're
dealing with today is because in that
initial giveaway video you might
remember those you watched it is that
while the dark rock 3 cooler here from
be quiet is a fantastic air cooler
autofocus come on don't fail me now
there ya go
it's it's just not very convenient to
ship with in fact it's sort of dangerous
it's very risky to ship a system with a
large CPU cooler power such as this one
and well I could ship it separately I
would have to hope with the winner who
received it knew how to install it
themselves without breaking anything and
it's just a little bit risky for me so
instead I'm going to be swapping this
out for the silent loop 280 millimeter
liquid a IO from be quiet
this is supposed to be a pretty decent
CLC for sure it's probably going to
handle thermals better than the already
good dark rock 3 there but the reason
why I didn't install this initially in
the first place is because I didn't have
an AM 4 upgrade bracket it does not
support a m4 natively out of the box so
here we have an a m4 upgrade bracket
straight from be quiet office in Germany
Radim and wait boys so I guess I guess
you guys know what's going to happen now
let's go ahead and swap out these
coolers and I don't
to do a/b comparison testing with
temperatures I'm sorry there's just way
bigger fish I have to fry before my
flight leaves today but the very least
you can watch me a swap out a cooler
because that's exciting right swapping
out CPU cooler so it's going to be a
it's going to be a great blog
Oh
upgrade complete pretty sweet I really
like how the the waterblock looks kind
of got this brushed aluminum finish and
if you don't mind the loud be quiet
branding it looks very nice I'm not a
huge fan of the coiled Springs around
the tubing it's not my favorite design
aesthetically but apart from that it
looks really nice
and I know this is kind of weird to
upgrade the giveaway prize midway
through the giveaway but hopefully you
guys understand why I did it and you
don't mind you'll probably like I said
get a few get some killer attempts as
well so that's not a bad thing I don't
know if you yourself from the footage
but I was not able to mount the radiator
at the top of the case because I was
running some clearance issues with the
vrm heatsink up here was just not going
to work out even though it does support
280 millimeter res at the top so I was
kind of annoying fortunately I was able
to put it at the front and it looks
great and and honestly I don't mind the
dark rock free not being here anymore
because it really opens up a bit more
visibility for the motherboard it's such
a nice motherboard the Auris the gaming
k7 here from from Oris / gigabyte or
whatever but you can see if it more the
accents them LEDs and I also did install
the flare X kit back into the into the
system as well the sticks weren't there
the beginning of the video you guys are
probably wondering about that but here
they are clerics kits okay on that note
hopefully you guys are cool with this
looks pretty nice again enter the
giveaway enter the giveaway if you
haven't yet it's awesome and then we've
got some packages to tend to here wifey
sauce just drop these off literally five
seconds to go on my chair so I don't
know what they are let's open them
alright let's start with this one which
it looks like it's from ooh ooh I know
who this is from I know what this is I
have a pretty good idea you guys are
going to lack my absence this is from
one of my favorite vendors to work with
they're just they're just a lovely bunch
always very accommodating super
supportive of everything I do
they're like my second parents really
but so you guys might have heard of them
a little company known only as G scale
look at this Blair X this is a 16 gig
kit 3200 speed cache latency 14
beautiful I actually requested another
because obviously I'm given my only kit
that I have currently away with the rise
in PC that we just looked at so spring
from G skill was very accommodating just
shipping this over he also sent me just
other RAM that I didn't really ask for
but it's always useful to have for a
reviewer like myself this is another 16
gigabyte kit 3200 speed some black
Ripjaws 5 ddr4 hell's yeah
and this oh look at those two more kids
in here good lord no this is just one
fat kid holy crap try to NZ yeah the
brushed aluminum got the white accents
they're beautiful this is a 3200 speed
32 gig kit a 32 gig kit 3200 oh this is
a this is a really nice kit Thank You G
skill folks over at that team I really
really appreciate it and we'll
definitely be using all of that memory
for something I don't know exactly what
but I always have a use for memory so I
let so bit of the second box here this
is from Amazon this is something I
ordered I was expecting this to arrive
today before I leave for Taiwan because
I plan to bring it with me it is a
battery but not just any battery folks
this is a battery for the brand-new
camera that I literally just bought
yesterday the Sony rx100 mark 5 which is
actually what I've been shooting with
for this entire vlog so far how's it
look we look pretty good I hope it looks
good but the reason why I got the next
row batteries because the battery life
on that thing just absolutely sucks I'm
going to change camera angles along with
that let's just let's just move it like
that
boom the mark 5 is the fantastic camera
the sensor the image quality is just
top-notch it's all about performance but
the one thing that it lacks is battery
life so I bought an extra battery which
is not going to do much because even
filming I've had to go through two
batteries already since the beginning of
this vlog shooting with this camera so
this is going to be my third battery now
for the rx100 mark 5 but I'm going to
try to buy two or three more of them
before my flight leaves today because
this is the camera that I'm going to be
using exclusively for all of my copy
text coverage this year which is pretty
exciting and also a bit terrifying
because up until this point I've only
been using DSLRs and mirrorless cameras
for all my event coverage
so now I've got a little point and shoot
that is maybe not quite as reliable
doesn't have as many you know
easy-to-use features but it is a lot
more portable and that's what I'm trying
to do this here is travel light I'm just
sort of sick of carrying around a big
ass backpack with like a you know three
lenses etc a bunch of heavy batteries
and things like that that might not seem
like a huge deal but after three or four
consecutive days of walking around a
massive show floor and jumping around
Taiwan or Las Vegas for CES it does wear
you down it does slow you down so I'm
going to try to try to travel light this
time around and do something a little
different so on that note it's about
10:45 right now I think well of what not
Walmart BestBuy has been open for about
45 minutes now so I'm going to go ahead
and give them a call see if we can
locate a couple of these batteries and
maybe some quick chargers as well
product availability press one please
enter the five to eight digit SKU number
of the product now check the
availability if item had limited
availability they're currently less than
three available at the store thank you
for calling Best Buy I'm gonna help you
I I was wondering if you could look up a
product or two for me I tried punching
it in into the phone with the SKU and it
lets me know that there's less than
three available but I needed an exact
number if that's okay okay I won't be
looking an exact inventory but if
they're less than three I can have
someone check and I can you do a yes or
no if we have it
oh you can't actually give an inventory
quantity if it's if it's less than three
that's that's still not possible no
unfortunately I wouldn't be able to like
a few or looking burns but this product
I could say yes we have that is it is it
packs I mean if there's if there's less
than three can you just look like
looking like just look look at the
shelves and just count them or that not
allowed
I can't um is a company policy we're not
allowed to give inventory levels over
the phone okay so if I needed two of
them you wouldn't be able to tell me if
you have two of them I can't do that
you're like interested encourage me I
can tell you if we have the number that
you're wanting that would be perfect
what is the person universe aren't
giving just a couple minutes awesome a
check on an opening sure thank you thank
you so much for holding here's a Gleek
on it we do you have the massage you
know I'm bringing over to enhance or
pick up but they're able to come in
today we can have it here for you great
and that was two batteries and did you
guys have more than one charger as well
you said there was someone charged every
also so there was another type of
charger that would also work for you
with honorees okay great okay thank you
very much but let's get some batteries
ran for the very faint energy to do that
today were you running you don't care
you didn't care
all right so I got a battery and a
charger that's right battery singular I
was supposed to get two lady on the
phone said they had two of them and that
the they had two Chargers but one of the
Chargers was a little different
turns out it was one of the batteries
that was different so now I got to go
pick up another different battery or the
same battery at a completely different
Best Buy which is just a total waste of
time so that's why you might want to
retrain your employees on customer
service and just basic competency but
the other guys that I work with in there
are awesome Adam and Moses you guys Rock
but on that note
let's go get another battery bitch are
you hungry
kinda but it's probably probably wait
till we get the battery what are you um
I think we should just eat now cuz it's
thirty thirty twelve so but I mean
better hands away I'm pretty hungry I
would like to eat now I do not want to
eat but we are not going to eat food
right right here called not going to eat
food I hope you're happy with yourself
so I just dropped a white pea sauce mop
because she's got some errands to run
her sales today and now I'm on my way to
the other Best Buy and they have I've
already purchased and ordered two extra
batteries so in total
that'll give us six because there's
another one on the way from Amazon as
well plus another quick charger I really
hope everything goes smoothly this time
around because I can't afford to lose
too much time as my flight is fast
approaching so yeah well that could not
have gone better in the bag and finally
the last pit stop I need to make before
heading home and editing this video is a
special place where I get to bond with
the senior citizens in my community I
call it the post office see if you guys
send any thank you ooh and it's just got
one for bid wit this is also from
different privet oh there's a third one
sweet I thought that's a fantastic first
fan tech and then what the heck is all
this crap is this oh I got I got a big
package okay so I think the next video
or the next tutorial on date wit is
going to be how to package an item for
shipment because look at this oh this
isn't beer this is beer it's already
toast alright let's open it up back home
this is from Austin hey guys no not that
Austin this one is from VA honey what's
the VA that Virginia Virginia seems like
we got
what's the huh is this strange there are
lots of fans like I mean lots guys like
one these are all Corsair fans to go
let's see an SP 120 this is a dual pack
blue LED so they're from Corsair is it
no it's just from some guy named Austin
who is in Virginia and then we got a 1
and err 140 white LED another air 140
white LED and here 140 blue LED wait
wait hold on
we're getting somewhere
nope it's a fan good lord oh wait wait
what's this last thing alright this is a
power supply Innova super Dover 650 watt
g2 from EVGA no letter no no context as
to why I don't know how to feel like in
one regard I could always use more fans
but at the same time what am I going to
wear I'm going to put these honey you
gotta you got to work double-time on
finding that studio okay well hey Austin
I don't know what you want me to do with
these unless you just you know wanted to
pawn them off someone who could make
some use of them but thank you I suppose
all right we made it to LAX yes you this
was Chris remember Christmasy yes he's
going to be editing for me
where did my wife go she went to the
bathroom we've already been five seconds
has he been here we've already lost
Waikiki stop we made it we made it
through TSA security
we even had a scare because I'm an idiot
and booked Christmas ticket as Chris
instead of Christopher his full name so
I was really we were all really worried
that he wasn't going to make it that
would just be left without an editor you
know and I would I would really sexist
more work for me you might get thrown in
jail but I would have to edit videos
like how awful is that this beer costs
my entire life savings
so I pee sauce act us each a very nice
little snack bag for the plane ride
because it's going to be a long flight
so what do you got here what do we each
get in our bags pretzels that's good spy
some things up that is genius someone's
thinking outside the bag but I mean like
Chris said why the hell is there
Victoria's Secret at the airport honey
you're a woman it's for its for people
who do the pants I'm really glad we
uncovered Victoria's Secret as to why
she's even selling stuff here
alright guys so since we're about to
take off our clothes up the video here
they guilt so much for watching to say
one last goodbye to Chris and wifey
sauce before seeing us once again in the
