video update for all of you subs out
there by the way thank you all for
watching my videos and you guys will
give me a lot of good feedback and much
support so I appreciate that one hundred
percent if you've been wondering why i
haven't uploaded a video in a couple
days it's it's because of because of
these things right here that one that
thing right there and see if i can get
the other one right there so yeah i
posted this on my twitter i tweeted this
so those either those of you that follow
me on twitter i already know see it's
why you follow me on twitter guys get
the info first but basically the other
night my girlfriend nice spot of these
two kittens on our way home from
basically just hanging out at night
downtown santa ana and we thought it'd
be a smart idea to take them home with
us because we're stupid and now we have
two kittens and i guess this is what
early parenthood must feel like because
i've been getting very little sleep and
have hardly had any time to myself
basically been taking care of these guys
and if you're asking i am i keeping them
as of now no i don't plan on keeping
them i'm simply just fostering them i
guess you can say until I can find them
a good home and I think they're brother
and sister because that we found them
together they're the pattern on them is
almost exactly the same the only
difference is that the girl Zenzi i
named him crappy everyone keeps telling
me oh you named him you're totally gonna
keep them but i'm not i'm not getting
attached to them at all but this is zen
she is retarded she's looking at there's
nothing up there just the ceiling that
one in the back there is riot he's the
boy and he is annoying but they've
actually been both been very good cats
haven't been any poop or pee accidents
yet knock on wood
but as you can see this is like their
favorite hangout spot you think Oh out
of your entire room Kyle where did the
cats like hanging out the most and the
answer would be on my desk by my desktop
on top of my keyboard right is always
sitting on top of my CM storm trigger
and which is why this thing has been a
freaking lifesaver this is like a
wireless keyboard / trackpad and it's
been immensely helpful browsing the web
and doing simple tasks because I
basically just unplug this thing now
this thing has been unplugged for three
days because I've just been using this
otherwise I can't get anything done
these kitties make Google queries more
than I do but um yeah this is just a
quick update guys and please forgive me
for not posting any gaming or hardware
content lately you can you can blame
them and I'm that's a story I'm sticking
to I think I think just for now I'm
going to I'm gonna brush up on my Linus
cat tips it sounds like a good idea
right about now alright guys thanks for
watching thanks for subscribing peace
you
