today I'm taking a look at the latest
Mini ITX case from NZXT that's aimed at
system builders who prioritize
performance gains via water cooling over
the space efficiency that often comes
with small form-factor chassis this is
the Manta and it's just about the
largest ITX case I've ever had the
pleasure of reviewing due to its curved
panels which give the case of very
unique aesthetic this case is so
curvaceous it's like Joker and Kate
Upton had a baby in her dreams such bold
designs are generally a love or hate
affair but even if you prefer a wet
cardboard box to the look of these
panels it's hard to deny the quality of
their solid steel construction and
excellent ventilation along the top in
front of the case the curvature also
leaves extra breathing room for fans
which aids an overall airflow both side
panel sport captive thumbscrews and we
get a massive side panel window to show
off your rig to your friends assuming
you have any removing the front panel
gives us access to a removable dust
filter for the two included 120
millimeter fans or up to a 280
millimeter radiator there's even room
underneath the dust filter to house two
more fans for push-pull configurations
atop the case is a clicky power button
adjacent to a white power LED strip that
doubles as a hard drive activity light
mic and headphone jacks and two USB
three popping off the top panel reveals
the same fan and radiator mounts that we
saw at the front
however radiator fans are to be mounted
outside the main frame without the
option of push-pull there's also no dust
filter here because NZXT hates you our
last bit of radiator support is a 120
mount at the back of the case that's
occupied by our third included 120
millimeter fan a nearby switch cycles
through the white LED options for the
rear i/o assistant light and NZXT
Strayed max shroud LED accent why you
know RGB was my first question as well
rounding out the exterior there's a
removable dust filter for the power
supply along with two wide feet with
rubber pads to prevent scratching your
desk surface inside the chassis we see a
spacious layout that's mork into a
traditional ATX tower pre-installed
standoffs are always appreciated but the
absence of any rubber grommets in this
case is a bit disappointing considering
the mantas hefty price tag that said
there are plenty of cutouts in all the
right places around the motherboard an
interesting cable bar high
most of the visible wires that you can
still see some of the clutter behind
that would otherwise be hidden with
rubber grommets CPU coolers up to 160
millimeters tall are supported along
with video cards up to 363 millimeters
in length just note that super thick or
triple slog cards will read into
clearance issues with the power supply
shroud my GPU gets awful close but six
ventilation slits on the top of the
shroud ensure your card isn't completely
cut off from your front intake there's
also a hole to neatly route all of your
PCIe cables or to perform the world's
first inter chassis puppet show assuming
your card doesn't overlap the large
cutout at the front of the shroud custom
water coolers can enjoy some relatively
thick radiators without much trouble two
removable SSD trays to the right of the
cable bar are held in place by single
thumb screws and work much like the
mounting plates found on the H 440 to
proudly display your drives upside down
that's why I'd recommend silicon Power
Drive since they look awful no matter
which way they're facing another gripe
that I have with the cases storage
solution is that both SSD mounts need to
be removed in order to install a three
and a half inch drive on the other side
a dedicated drive tray would have made a
lot of sense here and frankly should
have been considered for a case at this
price point while this makes me sad
inside there's nothing like an 8 pin PWM
fan hub to turn your day around
positioned right behind the motherboard
tray this module is an excellent
addition for a small form-factor case
with this much fan support
since most mini ITX motherboards have a
limited number of fan headers within the
large lower compartment of the case is a
mounting area for an ATX power supply of
literally any length and there's also a
lonely spot at the front for a two and a
half inch or three and a half inch drive
that screws in from the bottom of the
case again an independent mounting tray
would have simplified installation here
swapping out the drive after the system
is up and running means having to drop
the entire case on its side instead of
handling a single removable tray
additionally all this empty space kind
of feels like a missed opportunity to
include more drive options or perhaps a
mounting bracket for a water cooling
pump on the bright side so much room for
activities means cable management in the
Manta is literally the easiest thing
you'll ever do in your life every other
task will seem like child labor in
comparison to how effortless it is to
tidy up all the wires in this mini
behemoth numerous tie-downs ample room
behind the cable bar and a cavernous
compartment the size of a
clown shoebox make it easy to just say
get and slap the forgiving side panel on
without so much as touching a zip tie
indeed the get level of this case is
cable management is among the highest
I've seen to date and it's pretty
fantastic overall the Manta targets a
very specific niche of builder looking
for a water-cooled mini ITX system that
prioritizes overclock ability and
cooling over space efficiency there's
really a ton of hardware options that
can fit comfortably in the case while
still offering folks a smooth and easy
build process with zero cable management
fuss with the abundance of features and
quality steel construction this is
clearly a case built with enthusiast in
mind and the $140 price tag certainly
reflects this while I can confirm that
this is a good case with loads of
potential there are a few oversights and
missed opportunities that should have
been resolved if consumers are forking
out as much as they would on a high-end
ATX mid tower in my opinion the price
point is the main drawback here as the
mini ITX case market continues to become
more and more competitive so I'd keep an
eye out to see whether the MSRP drops
and then your future or if you can snag
a deal during whatever upcoming holiday
lurks around the corner if you already
have the funds because you're just so
money the Manta is an excellent choice
for those who know how to best utilize
its enchanting powers but</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
