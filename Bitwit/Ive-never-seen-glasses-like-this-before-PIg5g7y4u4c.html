interesting today it's a little bit
different than the usual kind of tech
that we take a look at on this channel
but still very interesting nonetheless
it's from boats they've actually decided
to sponsor this video god help them
these are the Bose frames and they're
the company's very first pair of audio
sunglasses that they brought to market
they're basically just a pair of
sunglasses that have built-in headphones
so you can listen to your music take
phone calls all while rocking your
shades it's a revolutionary idea we are
living in the future people and if you
know anything about Bose they are really
into high quality sound so today we're
gonna take a closer look and a closer
listen to these bad boys and just see
what they're all about
I like how they box this up there's kind
of these fun little tabs oh that's
that's very satisfying and before I go
any further I should point out that
these are the alto style frames meaning
they have square shaped frames the more
squarish kind of like the ones I'm
wearing now but they also offer circular
frames if you're into that sort of thing
with my face shape I'd probably look
like Harry Potter or something I'm sure
they look good on some people you can
also see that they have two size
variants small and large and they shoot
me a large I didn't actually specify
which size I wanted so they probably
just looked at my youtube videos and
went yeah he's got a pretty big head
we'll set him a large so let's pop a
little bun see what we got here oh
that's that's nice actually like a nice
sunglasses case manual instructions on
how to pair I should mention that these
connect to your phone via bluetooth it
says you can download the Bose Connect
app to set up your frames we'll take a
closer look at that just a bit alright
let's pop it open gentle now ooh
trifold case with a nice kind of velvety
material on the inside supersoft we have
a bag let's see what's in the bag what's
in the bag what's in the bag oh it's a
charging cable of course it's got sort
of a wone magnetic side it looks like
it's just a magnet I'm glad it's not
like microUSB it's just magnetic I would
much prefer that type-a on the other
side anything else in here know who
turned out the lights but let's take a
look at the star of the show shall we
the frames themselves whoo-hoo getting
undressed on camera look at that oh baby
you bad frames you bad so look at this
alright so first off pretty light weight
looks like it's mostly plastic material
which is fine it seems relatively
durable I also like that we have sort of
a matte finish all around I thought
things were gonna be a little bit glossy
err but not super reflective but there's
really not a whole lot giving these away
as something more than just
an ordinary pair of sunglasses from one
we have the magnetic contact where we do
our charging you just pop that on laakso
plug the other end into a power source
and I would assume that it starts to
charge we also have a tiny single button
that's under the right side of the
frames that powers the device on and off
its we are calling sunglasses of device
but it totally is a piece of tech it
powers the device on and off it pairs it
can also skip tracks and play and pause
and things like that so one button to
rule them all but perhaps the biggest
visual indication that these glasses are
something special is when you look at
the side profile you can see it gets a
little wider here that's where the
speakers are or the headphones whatever
you want to call them most of the
componentry fits right in there I'm sure
there's some wiring going throughout as
well but for the most part this is
definitely not your typical Google glass
situation where you're gonna look like a
total dweeb from the Year 3030 when
you're out wearing these in public so
that's nice you know what's also
interesting is I really thought that the
sound would be coming out from the side
right here going straight into your ears
but there's nothing here it's completely
flush it looks like bose has instead
decided to put the speaker on the
backside sort of the rear of the glasses
which I find kind of interesting I'm
wondering if that's just to protect your
ears a little bit so sounds not blasting
directly into your eardrums there's also
what looks to be a little speaker on the
outside of the glasses so I'm not sure
if these things can be heard without
actually having to wear them or maybe
that's sort of an air opening designed
to give you more of an open back profile
with the sound I'm not sure but I guess
we're about to find out let the
transformation begin okay you know what
they're actually pretty comfortable
they're super lightweight doesn't seem
like they're pinching my nose like the
bridge of my nose at all still feels
pretty comfortable now obviously I'd
have to wear these for a long period of
time to really determine how comfortable
they are in the long run but initial
impressions are pretty good my ears feel
pretty good too I'm not noticing any any
issues with like clamping force with
these arms are these cold arms I don't
know what these are called I forget what
these are called doesn't matter oh yeah
a pretty good planting force with the
large size bows was correct in their
assumption of my large head as far as
how these frames actually look when
you're wearing them that's of course
gonna be subjective but I kind of want
to see what I look like here oh my oh my
gosh well that's not too shocking I look
great in everything what's even cooler
is that wifey sauce could be yelling at
me while I tune her out with some dope
beats without her even knowing these are
already my favorite piece of tech for
2019 hands that on but note
test the sound all right we got a pair
first of course let me just turn these
guys on one tap and it immediately tells
me the battery's at 50% that's kind of
cool so I'll know if I need to recharge
it before I go out so the app already
picked up that both frames are in the
vicinity and it looks like it's
connecting right now connected to pixel
- what no I don't need this I already
did it
only the manual manuals for suckers do I
look like a sucker to you don't answer
that okay it looks like it's connected
oh cool you can name your frames you can
enable or disable voice prompts there's
the user manual right here in the phone
and it looks like you can do multiple
connections if you have multiple
smartphones tablets computers that you
want to actually use these with it looks
like it's installing firmware right now
transferring firmware seven percent
complete I wonder if we can listen to
anything while it's doing that oh why
thank you Mariah Carey for providing
this oh holy night track that you know
how perfect we're getting a call right
now I'm literally getting a call from my
grandpa hello what time is he coming oh
yeah we're gonna we're gonna do it
tonight yeah we don't mind you're
welcome
lovey - bye so okay this is actually
great now we don't have to like fake a
phone call I could hear every single
word that he said with perfect clarity
and if you guys know my grandpa he has
probably one of the thickest high
accents in the world so I guess it was a
perfect person to call as well so I was
listening to music on Spotify and then
when I got the call music immediately
stopped and it said you have a call from
three eight nine or whatever it didn't
say you have a call from grandpa even
though I have him saved as grandpa in
the phone but it just listed the number
which I guess is still fine I guess I
could have answered the call with the
button here boom that would've been a
lot easier but muscle memory just did it
with the phone as soon as the call was
over the music just resumed playing I'd
never do anything press a play or
anything like that it just knew that I
wanted to listen to Mariah Carey let's
switch it up Travis Scott something with
some bass so it sounds to me like there
isn't a tremendous amount of bass
pumping through these things which is
kind of expected because they don't have
a lot of space to work with to fit all
that tech the same time highs and mids
sound really good and the clarity of all
the music I've listened to so far is
undeniable I was just asking wifey sauce
how the sound leakage was she did say
that she could hear it around 5060
percent she was able
start hearing what I was hearing so
maybe you don't wear these in public if
you're gonna be right next to someone
let's say on a bus or on a train or
something like that
I can see these glasses working in a lot
of different scenarios but I think for
me personally I would find them the most
practical for outdoor activities so say
you have a morning commute every day to
work on your bike or you walk to class
or in between classes a bike ride on the
beach hiking what I like about these
wearables in that sense is that you have
one less item that you have to carry
around with you everywhere like your
headphones or your earbuds it's all just
kind of an integrated all-in-one
solution that's pretty cool let me know
what you think of these in the comments
y'all and special thanks to Bose for
sponsoring this video super thanks to

video if you enjoyed it and get
