doing well so it has been a few weeks
since the launch of NVIDIA GTX 10 atti
but only now are we starting to see
adding board partner variants hit store
shelves and as it turns out the shelves
in my office so we'll be looking at one
such offering today meet the Strix GTX
10 ATT IOC Edition from the folks at
Asus which we would hope provides a
cooler quieter and possibly faster GTX
10 atti over invidious founders Edition
sporting the same GP 102 GPU as Titan X
Pascal the Strix shares identical specs
with the FE save for the higher core and
boosts clocks dialed in by Asus making
it the faster card out of the box and we
mustn't forget NVIDIA has also fitted
the GTX 1080 Ti with only 11 gigs of
gddr5 X in a failed attempt to reassure
technics owners that they didn't waste
their money now with a powerful GPU like
the GP 102 the admission price for a
cool and quiet card is physical size and
the Strix is no exception
spanning 11 point 7 inches long 5.3
inches tall in 2.1 inches thick small
form-factor builders may find trouble
stuffing this 2.5 slot card and its
enormous fin stack into a mini ITX case
and this may be one scenario where the
founders Edition makes more sense with
its smaller blower style design the
open-air shroud boasts a sturdy plastic
construction with minimal flex inspiring
confidence in the cards build quality
meanwhile a trio of patented wing blade
90 millimeter fans stay frozen at lower
temperatures to eliminate noise
emissions but otherwise push air
downwards onto a quintet of 6 millimeter
heat pipes joining two aluminum heat
sinks one of which sports a copper heat
spreader that provides twice as much
contact with the GPU apparently
traditional heat spreaders aren't as
perfectly flat as they appear to the
naked eye so asus has utilized precision
machining to produce a flatter surface
that maximizes contact with the GPU for
improved thermal transfer the fin stack
itself allegedly features 40% more
surface area over previous two slot
designs which granted doesn't tell us
much since there have been a tremendous
number of dual slot cards in the past
but I suppose phrasing it this way
sounds more scientific than these heat
sinks are hella big trading in the
reference card six and eight pin power
plugs for a dual eight pin set indicates
a custom PCB a company
by a 10+2 phase power design premium
alloy components for reduced power loss
and thermals and some bonus connectivity
with asus fan connect 2 users get a pair
of 4 pin pwm fan headers that can be
automatically or manually controlled
based on GPU or CPU thermals as well as
an aura supported RGB header
conveniently placed at the front of the
card for easy access to SLI fingers and
they're familiar spots allow you to hit
earth-shattering frame rates with 2-way
SLI
would be great to test it though asus
just sand a beautiful brushed aluminum
backplate reinforces the PCB but not
quite enough to eliminate all GPU sag
though it's not terrible and this is
admittedly a tall order for a car this
size the back plates large ROG logo is
one of the cards several RGB LED
elements all of which can be configured
or disabled within the aura software
color accuracy is on point with the
exception of a rather warm white and the
overall execution looks cool but
tasteful with no visible hot spots the
rear i/o has been thoughtfully redone to
accommodate VR users with HDMI connected
head mounted displays in total you get
two HDMI 2.0 B to DisplayPort 1.4 and a
single dual link DVI ports now taking to
my Z 270 test build running a 7700 K
clock to 5 gigahertz which for the
record I would not recommend with a
hyper 212 cooler it was time to
overclock the already overclocked Strix
GTX 10 atti
in the end I managed a core clock offset
of 110 megahertz and the memory clock
offset of 375 taking us to a loaded core
clock frequency of 2025 megahertz and a
memory clock speed of 14 hundred and 70
as you can see the card barely topped 70
degrees Celsius with these figures a
whopping 15 degrees cooler than my GTX
1080p I founder's addition all the while
retaining an excellent acoustic profile
that far exceeded my expectations
so far the Strix has already impressed
me to the point where I would recommend
it based on the cooling and noise
improvements alone but obviously that
won't stop me from testing it in a slew
of games at 1440p and 4k so using our
mentioned overclock with the latest
three 78.92 wickel drivers on Windows 10
here is a look at the benchmarks
so clearly our card of the hour does not
trounce the founders edition in gaming
performance as we only saw about a 1 to
4 percent increase in average frame
rates as a matter of fact 1440p
performance was nearly identical between
the two cards in most of our games 4k is
where the Strix really seemed to
outshine the founders Edition by a
margin so slight the few extra frames
rendered would likely go unnoticed to
the average user in closing that's not
to say the Strix GTX 10 atti doesn't
deliver a spectacular high-end triple-a
gaming experience especially when paired
with the G sync supported display the
founders Edition TI is already a hell of
a beast with unruly thermals and
acoustics that asus has managed to tame
phenomenally well raising the bar for
other custom bearings while it's
undoubtedly a steep buy at 780 us at the
time of filming the $80 premium over the
founders edition is worth every penny
and everyone should go buy two of them
immediately
assuming you have ample room in your
chassis and funds in your wallet but
that's going to do it for now guys so
leave me some feedback in the comments
let me know if this kind of performance
is worth the price to you also feel free
to toss me a look on the video if you
enjoyed it helps me a lot and before you
go allow me to shamelessly plug bit with
ultra my buck video month early access
ad free channel where my videos post
early without ads holy crap that
sentence was more redundant than a raid
10 array also check out my store for
shirts and mugs in yada-yada-yada as
always i'm a kyle big with thank you
guys so much for watching subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already and
I'll see y'all in the next peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
