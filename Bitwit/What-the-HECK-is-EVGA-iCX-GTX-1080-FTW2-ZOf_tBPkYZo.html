channel today I'm taking a look at a
brand new video card from the folks over
at EB GA this is their gtx 1080
for the win 2 featuring their brand new
icx technology and that entails a bunch
of different things including a new PCB
and updated software with precision XOC
as well as some tweaks and changes to
the cooler itself over the a CX 3.0
model were already familiar with with
the 10 series cards from Nvidia so we're
taking a look at all that today I also
want to preface this video by saying
2016 was kind of an interesting year for
EVGA they started off really strong with
the 10 series launched with the HDX
coolers but then there was that incident
that overheating issue with the V RMS on
their GTX 970 s and 10 80s due to a
thermal pad not being implemented on
those cards so I feel like this is in
some small way at least a small way is a
response to that debacle if you will and
we're gonna be taking a look to see if
if this really is a step-up pun intended
from the from the existing a CX cars now
icx isin technology is going to cover
not just the 1080 for the win but also
GTX 10 60s and 10 seventies with the
base super clock and for the wind
variance you will be paying a small
premium however this is a $30 price hike
on this card actually on this particular
model over its a CX equivalent and
whether or not it's worth that those
extra 30 bucks we will find out by the
end of this video so on that note sit
back relax some of the correctives box
open and we'll take a closer look at the
card so here's a close-up look at the
card itself and you know cosmetically
speaking it looks pretty much the same
as the a CX there's not too much to say
in the aesthetic Department however
there are our couple changes one being
the the back bike here you see there's a
bunch of ventilation cutouts now so that
just allows hot air to more easily
escape off the PCB which is nice and
EVGA is also sort of re-engineered the
back plate and the base plate for that
matter to function more like a heatsink
because it's now making direct contact
with some of the components underneath
and that's supposed to of course aid in
thermals and whatnot actually if you
look at the base plate there are these
little pin fins that are sticking out
they're interlaced pin fins that just
add a little bit more surface area to
this now base plate / heat sink and of
course that adds to the
thermal dissipation of the whole systems
that's kind of nice
additionally we've got some new status
LED indicators that would light up right
here there's three of them you can't see
them on the cards off you have to wait
right the card to be all powered up and
operational
but these essentially give you an
at-a-glance look at your temperature for
various components on the card including
your GPU your vrm and your memory and
basically you can jump into the xoc
software and assign any color to any
temperature threshold to your heart's
content and that way you let's say sorry
the garage doors opening if you hear
that let's say your GPU status LED
indicator remains green when you're
under 40 degrees Celsius and then it
turns blue between 40 and 60 and then it
turns red anything past that you can
pretty much do however you like it just
gives you a really nice easy way to look
at that when you're gaming or whatever
now of course if your system is like
under your desk or you just don't have a
case where you can see this part of your
graphics card at all times then they've
also allowed you to throw up this
information on the OSD with with the via
XOC and that way you can see it on your
screen whenever you're gaming and things
like that now of course you might be
wondering well how are they measuring
how are they measuring vrm and your
memory well I'm glad you asked there's
actually that's probably the biggest
change to this card from an engineering
standpoint are is the the two MCS or
micro control units that have been built
in and that allows you to monitor the
new nine sensors that are now on this
board that are scattered about various
components including one on your GPU you
get five on your power area and you get
three for your memory and of course you
can't forget the one additional sensor
on the GPU just based on from Nvidia
themselves but essentially you get ten
sensors now that you can monitor within
the software and now that you have all
this new data coming in EVGA is also
given us a way to kind of handle and
respond to that with their new fan
design so these are actually the same
fans they're still the same size same
blade design and same bearings from what
I can tell however they're now a
synchronous meaning that instead of just
having one fan header on the PCB that is
kind of like split into two fans and
sharing that same header each of each
fan now has its own dedicated fan header
there
fan headers on this PCB which means you
can now set individual fan curves per
fans so this one would basically handle
your GPU temperatures into the fan curve
with your GPU is getting too hot
this one will ramp up and this one can
stay perfectly still if your memory and
VRM are completely in check thermally
speaking or you can have it the opposite
let's say you're doing a more memory
intensive task that doesn't tax be GPU
itself very much then you can have this
one roll at a low rpm have this one
speed up a bit and the faster fan will
kind of cancel out the noise of the
other essentially lowering the overall
acoustic profile which i think is pretty
cool I haven't seen this on a video card
before so we'll see if we can mess
around with that later and finally
before we switch it over to a look at
our test bed I want to quickly point out
the new Finn design here so there's
actually these little tiny holes now on
each of the fins kind of looks like
Swiss cheese in your video card but
essentially with those with those holes
they allow the air that's being pushed
down from the fans to more evenly
scatter and spread across the entire fin
stack and of course of condition more
heat and so forth there's big focus on
heat dissipation with this new lineup of
cards so hopefully that actually does
make a difference so here's a quick look
at our testing hardware and of course
we're gonna be testing two of these EVGA
GTX 1080s against each other today
one of which is the a CX 3.0 for the
wind the other being the eye CX
for the win 2 which is the card that's
clearly on display at the moment on our
motherboard you can tell because one of
the fans is spinning while the others is
not taken advantage of that asynchronous
technologies and I really did kind of
want to test out both of those
independent fan curves for the first
time but I was unable to do so because
it's just not working properly in the
software anytime I try to apply one fan
curve to one fan it overrides the curve
for the other so unfortunately until
EVGA gets back to me with buy some kind
of software update or they rectify or
patch the issue I'm pretty much stuck to
testing this at fixed fan speeds for now
between both cards which actually I
don't mind it all because it probably
reduces the amount of variants
especially when we're talking about
thermal testing so I did fix both of the
fans both cards fan speeds at 20 around
2002 2050 rpm so we're going to be
getting very consistent repeatable
results there hopefully and
additionally we've got a bunch of other
hardware to talk about here we've got a
59 60 x8 core from Intel this is their
ice
gscp you i've overclocked it 240 500
megahertz with the help of a corsair h
100 IG t --xv to 240 millimeter liquid a
io we've also got the the asus
motherboard here's of the Strix x99
gaming it's a beast of a board along
with 32 gigs of course here I'm sorry
g.skill tried NZ ddr4 of course at 3 200
megahertz so our storage goes we've got
a one terabyte crucial MX 200 with
everything loaded up onto it it's not
full at all so that shouldn't be an
issue in terms of performance slowdowns
and we've also got a gaming extreme 1200
watt power supply from gigabyte so we've
got plenty of power going to all these
components here I think on that note we
can go ahead and take a look at our data
so here we have the results and aren't
they beautiful yes indeed so you can see
here I've got them split up into two
halves so we've got the AC X numbers on
the left and the new IC x results on the
right side just so you guys don't get it
twisted I'm going to be going back and
forth like this for a bit so if you get
nauseous easily I want to pop a
Dramamine or something we've also got oh
I want to mention ambient temperatures
were kept at a constant 25 C in my room
thanks to this little guy shout out to
the window AC unit you ballin yo and
everything else was pretty consistent
fan speed again twenty-two thousand two
two thousand and fifty rpm on both of
the on both of the cards and these are
just screenshots of course you can see
here we left everything as is in terms
of the core clock offset memory clock
offset and our power and temperature
targets are all pretty much consistent
from A to B so we have a nice apples to
apples comparison on that we're going at
a temperature here for our AC X card 69
degrees C on the core was the max that
it hit whereas on the IC X but for our
71 mmm what's up with that we actually
went up two degrees on the allegedly
cooler card which of course two degrees
Celsius in gaming is not going to affect
your performance at all you're not going
to notice like oh I can really tell this
is two degrees warmer than it was five
minutes ago no that's that's not that's
not what this is about
however for a car that is marketed as
being thermally superior than its
predecessor I'm pretty sure that this
was not EVGA intent to make a slightly
warmer card even though it may not
affect your gaming experience I don't
know if I mentioned this but both cards
are also same between a CS and IC x2
core clock frequencies and memory clock
frequencies are exactly the same
out-of-the-box this did spike up a
little bit higher 1974 to 1961 on the AC
X however those could be outliers are
just maximum values if you look over
here with gpu-z you can see that they're
clearly clocked so here's 1721 megahertz
core and 1860 boost same exact deal over
here with the AC X 1721 and 1860 so if
performance is really not where it's at
if there's no difference in performance
between the two cards and at least in
this test since the fans are a fixed
rpms that acoustics are really not any
different either so I didn't even bother
doing an acoustics test because they're
spinning at the same speed then really
thermals are the only things that that
could be improved here which they are
not last thing I want to point out here
is power consumption so on the AC X card
eighty six point eight percent TDP
whereas we actually went up a bit to
ninety three point four percent on the
IC X card now why could that be I have a
couple speculations but I don't know if
they're true that's why they're
speculations the first one is that there
are new MOSFETs that are embedded or
implemented onto the IC x card so maybe
the new MOSFETs have something to do
with how they're handling the power and
then also the other thing was how the
fans are designed now that there's two
individual or two dedicated fan headers
instead of one being split perhaps that
has something to do with the power and
the the TDP things like that I don't
know and I don't really have the tools
to test it all out either so that also
reminds me there's probably some other
great tech tubers out there that also
have gone live with a video this morning
on this card so go ahead and check it
out I'll put links in the description
below all Hardware J's $0.02 gamers
Nexus of course subscribe to those guys
they're awesome and check out what what
their findings were because this is by
no means this is just one test that I
ran guys granted I ran it multiple times
and there was my results were consistent
and repeatable however you never know so
go ahead and cross-reference those guys
and show them some love
Tala map sent you on that note so let me
go ahead and close this video out with
some final words
so my overall takeaway from EVGA is new
icx technology is that it's a huge step
in the right direction I think all the
thought and engineering that's been
poured into it they're all really good
ideas and good concepts
are going to drive the industry forward
as a whole I think for a long time we as
gamers have been looking at GPU
temperatures primarily and overlooking
the fact that there are a bunch of other
factors involved such as memory or vrm
which can also overheat just as easily
as your GPU if not monitored properly
and now that EVGA is made an easy way
for us to do that we can then respond
accordingly
with with you know putting the proper
cooling strategies into place or messing
with a fan curves for example
unfortunately that's one of the reasons
why I can't get a super hard conclusion
on this card right now is because the
software wasn't quite ready so maybe
once the software gets patched let me
know if you'd want to see an update to
this video because I think the fact that
we're able to control them independently
could really add a ton of value to this
card I know it doesn't it's getting a
little bit warmer two degrees warmer
than what we saw in the AC X 3.0 today
but I think that's only part of the
story because of course we haven't
tested out one of the other main
features which is those fan curves so
let me know if you guys are on board
with this card or if you have any other
opinions but until next time guys thank
you so much for watching toss me a like
on the video if you enjoyed it and I'll
see you all in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
