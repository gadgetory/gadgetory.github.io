channel I hope you're all doing well
today I'm taking a look at fractal
designs very first liquid-cooled AIO
here in the United States this is the
Celsius s 24 there's the Celsius s 36
which is the triple 120 version and I'm
dealing today with the s 24 again the
240 millimeter variant so very exciting
stuff here this is more or less an ASA
tech design when you're talking
internally so there's nothing to
innovative going on under the hood here
I'm you are dealing with a DC pump
pretty standard and a ceramic bearing
and there's also a bit of a sound
dampening material under the hood here
which theoretically should make the pump
quieter I have tested this already I've
already plugged it in and and ran the
tests is very quiet we'll take a look at
the fans in just a moment how those
sound from an aesthetic standpoint
fractal hasn't taken too many risks here
it's fairly basic and straightforward
you might call it a little boring but I
actually don't mind it I like some of my
components to be boring like the AIO for
instance the personal preference of mine
but this also sort of ties in with
fractals Scandinavian minimalist design
or whatever you want to call it so if
you look at the waterblock it's kind of
a circular thing and it's glossy it's
black and glossy which I don't know I
prefer matte with everything there's
just a personal preference of course
I'll be get this is the snowflake get
the nice little fractal snowflake just
peaking out on the side there and then
look at there's two words there's two
words around the edges here Auto and PWM
the hell of that so there's no software
that comes included or is available for
download on fraggles website there's no
software at all when it's when it comes
to tuning or controlling this thing so
it's all hardware based and basically
this circular ring the sort of soft
touch circular ring that goes around the
waterblock is adjustable you can move it
switching it from auto to PWM you switch
it between those two settings Auto
basically makes the fans run at anywhere
from 1900 to 2000 rpm is what I was
seeing in hardware monitor which at that
speed these fans are are silent not
really quiet they're like I mean like I
can't hear them from ten inches away on
an open-air testbed they're that quiet
so when I was running it at Auto
initially I was like oh my god
temperatures are gonna be awful it's
just it's too quiet it's too quiet
actually not 77 note 7600 K our core i5
which I had overclocked to four point
eight megahertz we fired up gta5 1440p
2560 by 1440 PC
by 9:00 and 72 no 73 degrees Celsius
filthiest 73 degrees C on a fairly
heavily overclocked 7600 K which I am
pretty happy about with an ambient in my
room of 26 degrees Celsius give or take
a degree that's actually not too bad at
all and then we switch it over to PWM
especially at just how quiet that that
noise level I was just sort of blown
away unintended then PWM when you switch
it over to PWM the fans cranked up to
around 3000 rpm so there at that point
their audible and you can definitely
hear them even through a case especially
if your your case isn't tailored for
silence to begin with it's got a lot of
open mesh and things like that then you
can hear it but it's not obtrusive and
it's not annoying especially if you've
got any sort of in-game audio coming
through your headphones or your speakers
it's not going to bother you at least it
didn't bother me at all
so it's not too bad however temperatures
when you look at the thermals running
the same test in gta5 after about 20
minutes only decrease thermals on our
CPU by one degree
we went from 73 see with the auto
setting to 72 on the PWM settings so
really not worth it to go PWM in my
opinion at least from my testing on the
s 24 I would just leave it at Auto and
never change it again just stick it in
install it it's good to go
but that's that's a good that's good
sign this thing definitely can cool a
fairly highly overclocked CPU which is
honestly the most important part of any
a io IMO haha now the fairly thick
tubing which is rubberized is not kinky
which in this case is a good thing and I
really like the way it looks they've
sleeved it with some nice sort of nylon
or you know cloth material sleeving much
better than the metal spiral crap that
was on the Kelvin that was just whoo
that was special but this looks really
nice I will say and of course it's nice
to be even if you're in a cramped case
and you got to like squish things
together like in the M case m1 or
something like that
there is not going to be too much
kinkajou with this rubber material now
also if we look at the ends of the
tubing we see that there are these like
fittings on either side going from to
the water block into the radiator but
only the fittings only the gene a
quarter-inch fit
on the radiator are removable so this is
an expandable loop however you're
limited in that you can only remove this
end of the tubes you're pretty much
stuck that means with this tubing which
also means if you were to expand this
and add in like a reservoir and
additional radiators or GPU you might
have some clashing tubing you'd be stuck
with this one and you might have some
just other tubing that doesn't look
anything like this unless you can find
this exact tubing which if you don't
care about what your custom water-cooled
system looks like then by all means but
most of us who are going to spend the
premium on custom water-cooled parts
probably want to look all matching
matching stuff so it's just a little
confusing to me why fractal would allow
this side to be removed but fix the
other end I just a little a little
perplexed by that now that being said
fractal gets huge points for adding on
this built-in pwm fan splitter straight
on to the radiator
it's a great idea you've got these two
dynamic x2 fan tees or fractals in-house
fans they're not quite been thérèse
but they do a killer job anyway
two of these fans that are black and
white of course and they route straight
on to that fan splitter the PWM
connection and then you've got a third
cable that actually sneekly and
invisibly routes underneath thus leaving
of one of these tubes straight to the
water block and then all of those
connections get boiled down to this one
single black CPU PWM 4 pin connector I
was a mouthful which plugs straight into
the CPU fan header on your motherboard
so really this is a very nice sort of
elegant solution to clean up cable
management this is all wired up good to
go guys all you do is install you to
screw this to the top or the front of
your case or whatever you bolt this down
to your CPU all the cables all the
wiring is done all you got to do is plug
this one cable in stands pump
everything's good to go the only thing
that that might scare some people or my
concern them is can that one CPU fan
header on the motherboard actually power
and control all of these various
elements yes I think it can now the fans
honestly even the pump does not take
much power the CPU fan header I'm sure
any of those fan headers can handle the
amount of voltage required to run these
effectively so I don't think that's an
issue until further testing shows
otherwise I probably wouldn't worry
about it guys
but on that note let's move on to the
other thing uh looks like a little bit
about the radiator itself again 240
millimeters it is 30 millimeters thick
and it looks to have some pretty decent
fin density it's more or less standard
it looks kind of like the H 100 I which
is not a bad thing at all and it's going
to just get a nice little finish there's
some like lettering here like a model
number just kind of looks I don't know
it looks very industrial it looks good
man this is a cool little AIO and
honestly literally we don't I don't have
much else to say I think of an
installation installation was super easy
again I keep comparing this to the H 100
I because it's sort of a direct
competitor pretty much the exact same
installation process as the H 100 I in
fact you could even use the mounting
accessories from the H 100 I with this
and it would still work perfectly fun
it's like the same OEM ASA Tech and all
that jazz so installation is really a
breeze speaking of installation I didn't
mention this in the beginning of the
video but this is also offering rising
supports straight out of the box so
that's nice I probably already included
a b-roll shot of that at the beginning
but just to mention it for validation
yes it does support rising so that's
that's cool too
overall I'm 95% sure that I like this
cooler granted it's got some weird
quirks don't get me wrong like you know
not being able to remove the tubing on
this end and sort of stiff locking or
the stiff mechanisms that goes around
the water block for Justin PWM in auto
there's a little bit weird but for the
most part this does a fine job of
cooling my core i5 7600 k with even some
additional headroom there thermally to
push it a bit further if I want to hit
that nice 5 gigahertz mark I'm pretty
confident that this thing could do it
and and it does so while staying very
quiet especially on the specifically on
the auto setting just Auto it and it is
super quiet it's super good it's super
cool good in the end I would say this is
a successful debut on fractal designs
part delivering their first AO to the US
and it stays fairly competitive with
other offerings at its current price
point but that's going to do for now
guys let me know what you think of this
