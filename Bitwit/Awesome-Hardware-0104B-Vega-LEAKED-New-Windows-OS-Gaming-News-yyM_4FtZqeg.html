okay I've gotten the green light from
Paul he is the stream master and he has
given us the approval to go ahead and
start my half of the show so welcome to
awesome hardware this is episode 104
you're watching side B or or the second
part of the second half of today's show
if you missed side a and you're watching
this after the fact that we've live
streamed
you can watch Part A on Paul's channel
that's youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware
if you're watching this live welcome
back we have a whole other hour or so of
content to give you guys right now again
this is a show that Paul and I do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
right here on YouTube each of our
respective YouTube channels obviously we
break it up into two halves or on twitch
TV / awesome hardware where we stream
the entire show in its entirety which is
the most redundant sentence I've said
all day
that's all that's on that note so let's
continue where Paul left off no no first
off let's talk about some of the
merchandise that we are selling on our
respective stores mine is Billy tech
slash store I just added a replenished
hoodies so nice nice old hoodies just in
time for summer wear um yep just in time
for the hottest summer get him get him
while they're hot get hot as well as the
words in the circle are pretty cool am i
right bit with glasses now in 20 ounce
varieties much larger they can contain
they contain more booze now than ever
before think we're in ribbed for her
pleasure rig you should be my marketing
manager and then also Paul selling stuff
on his store calls
Paul's hardware net um he's got
everything everything that your heart
may or may not desire look Oh a shooting
solution all's yes or if you're going
for a spot of polo refresher or if
you're gonna play water polo that's a
must be what polo shirts are for so for
that and English pub glasses in all that
jazz so beautiful let's go ahead and
just dive right in to the news the tech
news to be exact
first of which is Vega benchmarks have
they been leaked yes yes they have let's
talk about it this article comes from
guru 3d comm and the
the benchmark that is in question here
is that of the 3dmark time spy test and
we haven't had official I mean or I
shouldn't say official or it's not
necessarily confirmed that this is a
Vega GPU but there are many hints that
point to that direction and just just to
briefly run down the scores that this
mysterious tree card was was yielding
five thousand nine hundred and fifty
points in three mark time spy and five
thousand seven hundred and twenty one
points yielded in the graphic score and
there's actually a nice little chart
here a nice little graph that shows
where this possible Vega entry stacks up
against the competition it's this one
and you can see it it's right in line
with the gtx 1070 from nvidia um which
is a bit underwhelming but we'll talk
about that in just a bit now there are
certain like I said cues that that hint
at this being a Vega card the first of
which is that this particular model was
rated to have eight gigabytes of memory
or was listed as having eight gigs of
memory running at 700 megahertz now if
you guys remember the feejee cards
particularly the r9 theory that was
running HP m1 the og HBM at 500
megahertz so it's not too far-fetched to
believe that this could be HB m to
running at a lower supposed lower
frequency of 700 megahertz it's
definitely not a stretch also this is a
also being displayed as using a beta
driver running at a core clock of twelve
hundred megahertz which seems kind of
low but bear in mind that this is well
before retail why do you have a picture
of a blonde chick on your uh tomato
McHale I was named a cup grad here in
person yes we have that um I followed
her on Twitter okay
it was very distracting to see like this
attractive young she's a true blind
woman on your on your you know
completely nude on on your laptop she's
not using I just thought it like I don't
know how you can focus with that I mean
they're no you're right yeah I'm totally
know she was gonna completely
just completely sidetrack yes III I see
I see I see what about about this would
this be a bit easier to share this is
great yeah that's not saving work right
there
what is this making you feel bad about
not browsing your Twitter feeds around
office right now I'm gonna start doing
it get all this I don't know what it's
like a Friday go over rice and some like
right vision meet around the side it
looks amazing
my slice is from mark Julio he I don't
know if he still works for Mad Catz he
is from work for Mad Catz also someone
who I met America a new egg just a
blonde he's Philly's Filipino still in
Abood yeah something to do it you're
following all the right people Paul
thank you very much sir Valley into the
third for the $30 nation we will be
taking all of the comments attached to
donations and reading them off and
answering your questions at the end of
this half so bear that in mind um ok
we're getting back on track here where
did I leave off yeah we think this is a
vega card we think that these benchmarks
are from a Vega GPU because of the
evidence that we've see seen here 700
megahertz with 8 gigs of memory that's
700 megahertz on the memory of course
and twelve hundred megahertz on the core
clock which again seems kind of low but
if this is an engineering sample which
is very likely then retail clocks may be
much higher
also the card was tested on an X 370
board with a risin 7 1,800 X GPU which
seems very AMD centric uh and I think
this is probably the nail in the coffin
of identifying this card as Vega is at
the driver ID for the entry in the the
3d mark database is 687 fc-1 which is
the same ID it matches the ID found on a
doom vulcan demo that was at an AMD vent
event so this is likely this is very
likely to be Vega I mean if you actually
there's a screenshot in the article that
I linked of the of like a screen screen
grab of doom so you can see the the 6 8
7 FC 1 right there matches the same ID
as the one in the 3 mark database so I
think that's very convincing to say the
least but I
say and and following up with what Paul
was mentioning earlier like this is a
little underwhelming to see Vega that's
been so highly anticipated competing
right neck and neck with the gtx 1070
but we have to bear in mind that AMD is
going to be releasing several variants
of cards using their Vega architecture
at varying performances and price points
so this could easily be you know maybe a
mid mid to high range but they haven't
really shown their full hand yet there
could potentially be a Vega card that
competes more directly with the GTX 1084
example and you know God willing a gtx
980ti that would be pretty freakin sweet
so we'll just have to wait and see till
then but overall this does show a bit of
what's to come from AMD Oh what was that
was that Loki she said beavis and
butthead laughs it come ha ha ha ha
as funny I did say that didn't I did all
right let's move on to her next topic
which is about Windows 10 s Windows 10 s
uh Paul did allude to this topic earlier
in his half of the show but Windows 10 s
is a new operating system from Microsoft
of course that is slated to compete more
directly with Chrome OS and Google
Google's Chromebooks those those nasty
little Chromebooks paper towels
everything um did you spill you did
spill just a little bit of beer the hell
is wrong with when it ported it just
came over the top we can't take you
anywhere
whoa all right go ahead and stall do a
little dance actually I've got some
paper towels here for I always keep good
paper towels my room for thermal paste
and stuff um face and and beer when you
spill it that's perfect for indeed um so
this was just announced by Microsoft
Verde today yes it was this was this
operating system Windows 10 s has been
formally rumored as Windows 10 cloud but
that's not the official name it's
Windows 10 s this is a new and
lightweight version of Windows 10
however there's a bit of a caveat before
we talk about that this operating system
is really targeted at education focused
devices so kind of the Chromebook
equivalents but running
running Windows so the catch the the
caveat that I'm talking about here is
that Windows 10s is going to function
very similarly to Windows 10 however all
the applications that you'll be using on
it will have to be downloaded directly
from the Windows Store you are basically
locked all the users are locked into the
Windows Store environment anything that
runs on a Windows 10 s device will have
been acquired through the Windows Store
which is uh you know it sucks I mean but
but you know I mean that's that's kind
of the case I guess but a lot of these
educational devices I remember when we
had computers in my high school they all
suck they all had like stupid
limitations on them granted it was
completely different because they were
more like you know different sites you
couldn't access you couldn't go on like
MySpace or xanga where all those older
social media sites but this is a sort of
in that same vein you again anything
that's on the Windows Store that's the
only thing you'll be able to access
unfortunately to respond it to twitch
chat yeah yes Jerry has already started
talking about how terrible windows
tennis is oh I'm sure yeah he is a you
can always leave is Jerry to a bash the
Microsoft's so the other thing here is
that 10s users I'm just going to call it
10s to as a shorthand they can still run
x86 based desktop applications which
does which is one of the things the main
thing that sets it apart from Windows RT
you weren't able you're not able to do
that on RT again those those x86 based
desktop applications need to have been
packaged and listed in the Windows Store
to be supported on those devices the
operating system will run any browser in
the store this was a direct quote from
some bigwig at Microsoft
perhaps hinting that Google should bring
chrome to the Windows Store it is the
number one operating sorry web browser
so it makes sense that the Microsoft
would want to see that pop up in its
store to sort of promote their Windows
10 yes I don't know how to feel about
that why having like I want to say yeah
Google should do that but should they
yeah I don't know a like they don't it
like it supports themselves it supports
the Chrome
browser but it also sort of shoots
themselves in the foot because it
prevents people from maybe buying a
Chromebook yeah right
it sort of competes with itself but also
that's what happens when you're a
company that makes so many different
products and services you know and you
you want to like sometimes sometimes
promoting one product means you have to
sort of uh you know I don't know
sacrifice on marketing the other I don't
know but at any rate this is going to
feature the new operating system is
going to be featured on a wide range of
products starting at 189 u.s. very
affordable for the the poor person
student most students are poor so a sub
$200 price point seems reasonable all
products rockin Windows 10s will come
with a free subscription of minecraft ya
education edition oh sorry yeah oh that
was a class mean that was really close
oh it was almost good um I don't know I
didn't even know that there was an
education before you craft this diamond
pickaxe you must add or these math
question you must replace is what it
does one what is what is the Capitals I
ear haha ah
here's your coal you do detest it um and
also a free office 365
with Microsoft teams ok so not not
actually the office 365 suite but you
will get educated you'll get free
education for some period of time with
the Microsoft team's team I don't know
the hell Microsoft teams is time will
tell if Microsoft can steal any of the
market share in the education sector
from Google and they're popular
Chromebooks also I thought this was kind
of interesting
Microsoft is including some education
based features into their new OS you can
read about it in the article that we're
talking about here I can go over all the
details but a full version of Office is
coming to the Windows Store which is
nice being able to have full access to
you know full Excel all the Word and
PowerPoint features on a device like
this that's kind of cool
and here's the here's the kicker
students with Windows 10 s can upgrade
to Windows 10 Pro for free at any time
so and and as you like to upgrade you
can then install any program doesn't
you're no longer limited to the Windows
Store applications you can its its
Windows 10 Pro so I don't know why
anyone would not do that if you're how
they validate that you're a student
Oh edu email address perhaps is probably
a yeah an active edu address it seems
also lately yeah I don't think you're
you you have any notes on this and this
is a CNET story that I just pulled up
but they also announced a surface laptop
for 999 bucks with Windows 10 S on with
Windows 10 so this is for the is for the
rich kid in your class that everyone
hates yes and so there I think you're
saving a little bit of money on the cost
overall cost of the surface because of
the Windows 10 s instead of full Windows
but the surface is a nice little laptop
sure is one looks pretty damn good
a thousand bucks is a pretty good price
and um like look how thin it is yes yeah
if it's right in your your backpack easy
to carry around with you on campus I
wonder how the battery life is yeah
probably not a met and it's it's pretty
good yeah I would have liked this this
is potentially a huge competitor for
something like a macro little pro oh
yeah down on my chest and when it comes
to the thin light category um cuz it's
got I mean like these finishes that they
have going on yeah it's definitely
different kind of like a granite yeah
kind of granite or gum stone finish or
whatever comes with a little stupid
Microsoft Mouse hate those mice I don't
know they're not bad they're dumb hey
they have a very small footprint anyway
check out the CNN article go to cnn.com
and search for surface laptop is
Microsoft's 99.9 Cal's not going to have
this article link in the description is
what I'm trying to say so gogoat
they're calling yeah okay all right so
that's fun let's move on to our next
story which is about the next generation
of VR enhancements coming to the HTC
vive very soon I'll actually talked
about this briefly he talked about one
of the things and one of the features
one of the new technologies that's
coming up quickly but I want to go over
a couple others this is just the
beginning there's lots of room to grow
when it comes to virtual reality I'd say
what the HTC vive and oculus rift
launched no more than a year or two ago
and the the the vibe launched over a
year ago the rifts launched about here
ago yeah so still very much in its
infancy this VR technology and there are
a lot of companies that are trying to
build on that and trying to grow the
platform to make it better make the
experiences richer for the end-user of
course vibes virtual reality venture
capital Alliance or VR CA is a group
trying to take VR to new heights
especially on the vibe and this will
likely bleed over to the rift so you
know obviously these technologies the
ones that stick will probably eventually
sort of spread to the other platforms of
the competitors and Engadget which is
where this articles from took a sneak
peek at what's to come to the vibe at
the the group's fourth official meeting
the first of which is is sort of like
Wireless VR I mean it is Wireless VR
even though we already kind of have a
taste of that Wireless VR is already
possible with the help of TP casts
adapter that they shipped earlier this
year but now that same company is
working on a newer upgraded adapter
called the TP cast Business Edition that
not only enables Wireless play but
multiplayer which will give more freedom
to users who are collaborating ideally
in the same physical room within a vr
environment so type player like
multiplayer like when users are in the
same like to base to people wearing to
VR headsets right in the same cube of
Cuba VR nests
yes to call that yeah we've seen
room-scale space in the same room scale
area
it's gonna be that's gonna be awesome
because eventually you'll have these
situations where they're playing a video
game to gives you the sense like oh you
know I'm doing whatever in VR yeah
but then like there's another player
yeah and then you physically like you
know tackle them or something yeah and
everything breaks yeah
great real boxing cool so so um there's
a there's there's a lot to be to be said
more more about this it's going to give
more freedom obviously social media
improvements they there's a company
called oben or Obon I'm not exactly sure
how to pronounce that they've partnered
with WeChat which is huge social
platform in China and they're building
an AI driven virtual environment that
allows VR users to seamlessly interact
with WeChat users on mobile so you might
be at the grocery store and I might be
in my VR headset here in this room and I
could we can have a conversation of some
sort we can we can interact with each
other you know while you're on your
mobile device and I'm just dicking
around here um it involves creating a
realistic can't you do that with like
phones you can do the you could do
without what do you do you know I can
talk you could do that with phones Paul
but that's no fun like what where's the
fun in that you know it's not VR let's
make it infinitely more complicated by
introducing a VR headset in light boxes
and I'm just saying like there's there's
tons of potential for VR and cool things
you can do with the AR but I feel like
video chat like is like I don't think
there's well alright alright alright but
I don't know there's nothing that I take
it back yeah you do Star Wars what not
what I thought you were gonna say cuz
Star Wars you know when they're when
they talk to people they have like a
little hologram the hologram or yeah
like that okay
okay like okay okay if people are going
if VR is gonna catch on in a big way
and people are going to be spending more
time in their headsets doesn't it make
sense that if someone texts you you
should have a way to be able to interact
with them immediately directly and
easily without having to ever take your
headset off or grabbing a keyboard of
some sort doesn't make sense I mean
being able to just like converse
say with its bridging the gap between
two completely different mediums text
messaging for example says vo it is a
good question and something that I'm
sure will come up more often as VR
becomes more popular like I don't know
if or something like that I I feel like
mixed reality would make more sense
something like a hololens where you can
still see the world around you mm-hmm
so where you could type on a keyboard or
something like that better or what for
what about a game that you know can can
support VR but doesn't necessarily have
to you don't actually have to be in a
headset to play it so let's say you're
doing sort of a VoIP thing between
someone who's playing without a headset
and you're actually wearing a headset
and if it's like a co-op game or you
know you usually need to communicate
within the game you know it how are you
going to talk to that person if they're
on a keyboard and you're in a headset
yeah so amazing I mean right now in VR
you've got the headset you've got
whatever controllers you're using or
something like that so some like if you
can't just talk and they can hear you
like with a microphone or something like
that then yes there needs to be some
solution for how you might communicate
with someone because you don't just have
a keyboard and you can't just type when
you're using the VR controllers or yeah
that kind of thing so so yeah um so so
basically what this is what this is a
you know developing what this companies
developing is a way to use smart speech
to text programs where like you know if
you were let's say at the grocery store
with your phone and I was here with a VR
headset I could just do a speech to text
type of thing where i'm like hey Paul I
hate you and then it just it just texts
you the the text it'll just send you the
text and you'll get it and it's more
accurate things like that that is being
worked on currently and it's also the
companies also developing an app that
will allow WeChat mobile users to
control an avatar in the VR world
without wearing a headset so even if you
were at the grocery store I could still
you could still command and control an
avatar in a VR environment that I would
see okay um and so like a like you know
it would you know sort of bring us
together a little bit more
obviously for me a bit more since I
would be wearing the headset and I could
see you and walk around you and stuff
you wouldn't be able to do all that but
you would still have sort of an avatar
that you could control from your phone
which would lower the barrier but you
know for for VR experiences
theoretically and some reason that
reminds me of like tights play World of
Warcraft right mm-hmm world of warcraft
and I'm World of Warcraft there was what
what was known as keyboard Turner's
Turner's yes which is people who use the
keyboard to turn left and right button
oh yeah yeah which is way less efficient
than turning with the mouse right so you
can actually whip around and aim at
something or like that right right right
so maybe in the future if someone's just
controlling the avatar in a VR you know
in a massive online game or something
like that and so just controlling with
the controller or a keyboard or
something and walking forward and back
they don't have the full range of
movements and quick whatever that you
would if you're fully like in the VR
immersive units or whatever it tracks
your movements that will be the
equivalent of a keyboard turner be a VR
Turner or no I'm mobile Turner
yeah okay anyway just that's what popped
into my head all right and then seven in
Venson which is one of the companies
that Paul was talking about earlier in
his half of the show they're doing a
pretty cool I tracking kit I'm not going
to go into detail about that you can
watch Paul's half in order to get more
info on that and then exactly one last
one is uh-oh no that was it that was all
of it that's all all the all this
technology that was shown and showcased
at this meeting is still under
development but most of it according to
the article will be available this year
at some point in the form of upgrades to
the HTC vive these are sort of you know
add-ons to the vibe if you will the vibe
staff did not confirm whether any of
this showcase technology would appear on
a next-generation headset in the near
future it would be cool if we had like a
vibe to point O or 3.0 later down the
line that just included all this crap so
you wouldn't have to keep buying these
little add-ons or whatever
but that's what we're stuck with for now
and let's move on to our next topic
which is about a sir I think this uh
article comes from the same sort of
press conference that Paul was
discussing with the X 27 X 20 set
monitor this is the predator triton
triton and 700 which is a badass ultra
book slash you know gaming laptop it
says it's frost forged ross i catched
that's how is that it's not true that is
objectively not true that it is frost
forged forged in the in the confines of
ice on the on the towel on the big
mountain of glacier palace is just and
so fanciful and not sounds like they're
canada like a game of thrones sounds
like yeah Game of Thrones that's stupid
so a star announced this at their recent
press event is the first laptop in their
new line of predator Triton ultra-thin
gaming laptops features an aluminum
housing at 18 millimeters thick and the
specs include Katie Lake Core i7
processors did not say if they were
mobile or not but since it didn't mess
Pesa phi mobile I would guess get all
desktops are very very effective
self-destruct feature that makes the
keyboard does completely explode and fly
to the air as you can see here that's a
security measure that sister really
intense yeah the entire thing flies
apart picked every constituent part it's
amazing as soon as I've been waiting for
this technology you can still figure it
to automatically do that as soon as
someone clicks on your web browsing
history
yeah it just instantly disintegrates and
explodes in your face takes out the
person watching they just die instantly
so specs include cable a core i7 GTX 10
series cards so I believe you might be
able to get a gtx 1080 in this on the
phone is really only 70 and 80 or all 60
70 80 so it seems very much like this is
already competing with the razor blade
pro series right you get the aluminum
housing the super thin design the ten
series cards two PCIe SSD s up to 32
gigs of EVR for mechanical keyboard with
LED backlit keys these are the scissor
switch type of mechanical keyboards
not necessarily like the old-school like
like the Titan SLI keyboards where it's
actually a real straight-up Cherry MX
keyboard
that that seems that seems BS well
that's what razor says the same thing
about their blade Pro there are
mechanical switches yeah they're using
mechanical likes really flat
mechanical switches like the world's
first mechanical switches and and to
some degree they kind of are they sort
of have a lot of the same similar traits
under underneath as as a mechanical
switch does but they feel completely
different obviously because the travel
is so short things like that so there is
some sacrifice there they actually feel
like the blade pro se does not feel the
greatest to type on those mechanical
switches are kind of a pain when you're
just typing up an email or you know word
processing document however when you're
gaming they feel very tactile um far
superior to just a regular scissor
switch that you'd find on most keyboards
so it's kind of like it well if you're
gaming a lot then it's worth it if
you're mostly typing and taking notes
why would you even buy this keyboard or
this left up in the first place
and it does have a 15.6 inch display
which is unfortunately limited to 1080p
resolution which granted you'll be able
to push the pixels easier and you'll
probably get more performance that way
however it's just kind of nice to have
like I don't know like a 1440p or 4k
screen just to get that extra fidelity
if you're gonna be you know viewing
viewing movies viewing pictures things
like that it is nice to have that option
because you can always scale down
obviously you can't scale up unless
you're using like you know super dynamic
resolution or whatever 1080 dynamics
anybody definitely seems more like a
bang for the buck resolution yet then
then something that should be on like a
flagship product yeah and then the other
interesting thing about this laptop is
that the trackpad is actually behind the
keyboard assuming that Acer is probably
guessing that most gamers are going to
be connecting a mouse you're not going
to be using a trackpad while you're
gaming play so jack pads appear trackpad
is actually behind the keyboard yeah
that's it but it's actually uh coded by
a layer of Gorilla Glass the entire
thing a trackpad uh or just this I don't
know if it extends the whole length but
I would imagine I'd imagine probably
four lefties and righties right so that
you can use it anywhere that's weird and
there's no you know like like even
there's no like click obviously there's
no physical click it's all just like tap
to click and stuff it is strange I I'm
not sure if I'll if I like that I have
to try it out myself to see how much of
a pain it is um but I'd rather I'd
rather have the IBM nub I'd rather have
that yeah
nub in the middle deal the IBM feminine
yep I was pretty good with the think bad
not bad yeah I didn't write it all down
yeah I got you man I'm not gonna game
with it but sure it seems a little bit
more practical than ever to reach up
above the keyboard right yeah and I feel
like there's a trade-off here because
now that you you've moved the keyboard a
lot closer to the edge it's almost like
you don't get bothered by the edge of
the of the laptop like your wrist the
you know what I mean there's not as much
interference
things like then you would need a wrist
wrist okay
not necessarily sometimes let me have
any notice there's there's a decent
amount of space right there and any
keyboard that you have like I mean not
need but if you want if you want to be
more gonna I mean that's one of the nice
thing about about laptops is that you
have built under stressed I'm just say I
don't know okay see see that kind of
that makes sense but it's that argument
sort of goes out the window for me when
you consider gaming laptops that
especially have these 10 series GPUs
that and aluminum chassis that conduct
heat very well a little too well so
whenever I'm gaming on this the razor
blade here for example or the blade Pro
it gets super hot and it actually
irritates my wrist because it's just too
warm after you know 20 30 minutes of
gaming it's like a wrist rest that heats
up way too much so I actually get very
uncomfortable and I almost sometimes
wish that the that the keyboard was a
little bit closer to the edge but you
know obviously we don't know exactly how
hot this is going to get under load so
that remains to be seen but Paul's wrong
I'm right your face goes out the window
[Laughter]
that sounds uncomfortable but keep your
eyes on that it's going to be starting
at two thousand nine hundred and
ninety-nine dollars
Oh three thousand dollars starting
that's maybe I don't know that if that's
for the 1080 model it's probably a ten
sixty model which is absurd hopefully it
goes down after they realize no one's
buying them moving on to the games
reports I'm going to go through these
relatively quick there's not too much
heavy meat here on these articles the
first of which is about the Nintendo 2ds
thirds lower thirds games report yeah on
a well done Nintendo 2ds XL was recently
announced by Nintendo and this is going
to support some the same the same games
as the new 3ds just not in 3d hence the
name 2d s it's very self-explanatory
this borrows a lot of the features from
I don't want to play this Nintendo is
gonna fly your video no just move your
moving move your mouse mouse cursor over
the video the whole time and you know
throw off the algorithm totally that's
that's how it works okay all right so
while Paul's doing that this is going to
be using a lot of the same features as
the the newer 3ds like the c-stick the
amiibo compatible NFC reader and extra
processing power so I actually really
like the way it looks it looks super
clean very very stylish it's using the
same familiar clamshell design unlike
the original 2d S which was just a
really ugly sort as a slate as a sea
stick has a C stick hell yeah there's a
B those Marines here amiibos read your
vows which is awesome everyone loves me
bows that don't everyone
Paul's got a collection oh hey um this
is launching July 28th I remember I
should just buy an amiibo to see what
it's like see what I'm missing out on
you know I'm sure there's like this
really great feeling that you get when
you get an e building ah yeah see the
like yeah sure thing I get it no not at
all I'm retailing for a hundred and
fifty bucks u.s. very competitively
priced on July 28th I would suggest
pre-ordering the sucker if you do want
one really badly because I guarantee you
they're gonna sell out really quick
people you want you're gonna art to get
this and nuts which okay so here's a
difference at first you might think why
is Nintendo even releasing another
handheld which si
to compete directly with the switch it
doesn't though because at 150 bucks it's
literally half the price of the Nintendo
switch so you know you're you're
targeting a different audience you're
targeting maybe kids who don't need the
full you know gamut of features that
come with a switch or that you know the
titles in that in that area I think that
what's keeping the the DS series alive
honestly and I've read this in other
articles is like the Pokemon franchise
Pokemon franchise is like still blowing
up like more than it ever has and you
know it's it's making it's one of the
reasons why these these units are
selling out and why they're selling just
millions and millions of copies a year
so as far as I know there's no like
Pokemon game slated for the switch yet
and so people who are fans of that
franchise which is you know an enormous
group of people will probably be
flocking to something like the DS you
don't think that's coming though uh I
mean a Pokemon game IH I I don't know
it's hard to say it's hard to say if if
Nintendo would do that because then at
that point I would they not do that yeah
you're right there's no reason for them
not to do they haven't done it so far
for any of the other like whoa because
of recent consoles because for good ones
right there's plenty of like you can you
can talk a lot of crap on new Nintendo
this house in Newton news uh Nintendo
Road you say what because they've did a
lot of stupid stuff but they do
understand on some fundamental level
that games have to just be good and they
do do a really good job in a lot of
situations of just making really good
games true and I feel like with
something like Pokemon they would
hopefully have the understanding that
they can't just out a Pokemon game
yeah make sure that to make sure it's
completely functional of course you have
to make sure it has some tie-in with the
new way that the the switch works and
everything like that so III don't doubt
that Nintendo would make a Pokemon game
for the switch I just think it would be
different enough to where it'd be a
completely different type of Pokemon
game yeah as what you could find on the
DS like remember like when the originals
like the red and blue versions came out
for Pokemon on the Gameboy say do you
remember when this happened is Pokemon
too
oh yeah I forgot you were like you're
like an old man or even Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles sorry I don't know what
else I'm that's so sad that the Pokemon
phase escaped you like you didn't grow
up with Pokemon no because my hogs in
Ekta forties I know you're near like
we're like what the is this
you must have been sinking like the hell
are all these kids on about that was a
great time man no I was I was Leslie are
you sweet enough to wear like I wasn't I
was like the older people who are just
like I have no idea what the hell is
going on like I was able to grasp it to
some extent I understood I understood
how the appeal of it was in the
collection aspect there all that kind of
stuff so yeah I understood it and I knew
what it was and I didn't think like oh
that's lame sure it was just I was older
yeah bad not into it completely not the
target demographic for for Pokemon at
that point so so yeah how do you know
where get off my lawn dude crotchety old
bastard damn kid um so like what I was
saying though like they had the original
red and blue versions of the game on
Gameboy and it was very much like
top-down sort of RPG and then they came
out with Pokemon games for the you know
them Tendo 64 but they were completely
different it was like Pokemon Stadium
you know Pokemon snap they were
completely different experiences that
you could only get on a console at that
time which I'm probably guessing is if
anything is going to be similar to what
Nintendo does here for the switch but I
digress as is as is the case of the show
but let's move on to our next topic here
which is player unknowns battlegrounds
just a quick honorable mention here in
that this game is currently killing it
they are slaying if you will the game
entered steam early access on March 23rd
and sold 1 million copies by April 10th
now one month later less than a month
later with 2 million copies sold it has
doubled its player base in less than a
month holy well damn developer blue
hole announced that it'll be matching
donations up to $100,000 during their
first charity invitational like which
benefits gamers outreach happening this
Thursday May 4th at 9
I am for those of you interested it will
feature 32 two-player teams from North
America and Europe I'm glad that they
have excluded all of the Asians because
as as an h1z1 player myself the Asians
are just too good they're too good and
it's not fair
okay the Asians are Opie because you
know when you get killed by an Asian
because it's just like some like the
username like just doesn't make sense or
it's like some broken English okay and
say that's definitely an Asian person
there's no other person it could be and
they're just so good and they travel in
packs you know they're they're
incredibly incredibly talented and
gifted and they're a piece of you
know to all of us gamers who really want
to try to win I really like the
developers name blue hole blue hole that
sounds very just very Clegg being a it
set it's so borderline suggestive but
not a rabbit it's just a blue hole what
there's a hole and it's blue what's
wrong with that it's like it's like
hasn't that there's nothing I didn't I
didn't mention a rim job at all let make
that name like this I didn't bring that
up why are you why are you asking what
the association is with that what time
I've video games all of a sudden I just
want to like go jerk off you know what
the hell's going on here um that's what
happens it's it's just very uh I think
the name blue hole definitely exploits
our dirty minds that's what it does I
think maybe that could have been the
developers intent those those
blue holes mm-hmm exactly
cited what it's like I didn't you didn't
get back to me last night where were you
up to say no more
all right well that explains it no
details needed all right so
congratulations two player unknowns
battlegrounds for doing a killer job I'm
sure stone also had some nice milestones
this month or this week seventy million
players they are up to 70 million
freaking players up from 30 million in
2015 so just two years later they've
more than doubled their player base Wow
they also broke a record on top of that
for most simultaneous players at one
time it didn't specify if this was just
for mobile or just all
I don't know could be for all time
this was after they had just released
their journey to Ungaro expansion so
that obviously brought a lot of new
players and they un'goro crater in
Goryeo Bubba and Goro Goro crater
un'goro crater yeah I don't know what
that means but to celebrate the company
is giving players free free card packs
from now until the end of May so anyone
who logs in to hearthstone will receive
three free journey to Ungaro card packs
no so I just thought I'd throw that out
there I'm sure a lot you guys have
already heard about it just in case you
didn't you don't want to miss out on
those free cards also there's another
thing that I would like to bring to your
attention this is the last little tidbit
that I had four games report today which
is a gog gog gog um good ol gog the
steam competitor and alternative is do
it excuse me is doing a may the fourth
sale nice as you might have guessed on
all the Star Wars games that you can
imagine up to 77 percent off on games

just to make up for it I'm wearing the
shirt that you you gave me which is
amazing I'm gonna wear this shirt every
day I know it's a little douchey guys to
wear a shirt with yourself on it but I'm
ok with this because someone else made
it and it's kind of like a fan thing and
also it just looks really fun and it
really makes me just want to make that
expression like anytime someone like
walks in the room I just want to go
where'd your pink incidentally a pink
wristband the pink wristband that you're
wearing in
oh Jesus where is it in here you were
wearing that very consistently for quite
a while and I will continue to wear it

standard as shown on this shirt um but
we have a bunch of other things so thank
you very much Brian I'd really do
appreciate in all the brown shirts that
you would send my wife some of the the
swordfight shirts that in the female
sizes IBC sent my wife a couple shirts -
yes so we do appreciate that very much
sir um but so let's go ahead and open up
how should we do this we just like inbox
everything at once and just have like a
you know crazy Christmas morning type of
sort of sort of an opening or a time I
mean we can each grab one but we should
only focus on one at a time of course
yeah I don't want to be too ADHD um all
right I'm gonna open this letter okay
first-gen you pick one to open your
letter as well okay this is from max max
of Colorado Springs Colorado
all right we're your place for Colorado
Springs to be right hey wouldn't you
just call it Springs technically that
would already be I'm fine but with white
powder okay this is a nice little
post-it note on the car that says I'm
fine if you show this in a video but
please if you do show it in a video
instead of a stream so that I don't well
I I do apologize max but you know what
this stream will eventually turn in
anyway video so you won't be able to
you'll definitely catch it if if you
puke if you do please open this sooner
rather than later hopefully this is
sooner um I'll just read really quick
hey Kyle this is actually meant for Paul
Oh what but I trust that you can help me
as well not really okay
in the February Mini ITX build I am
looking to switch out a few parts the
GTX 1080 will be replaced with the 1080i
founder's addition both SSDs with one
Kingston HyperX savage 480 gig and one
WD black six terabyte the horrible
Noctua fans will be replaced by Corsair
HD 120 s however many I can fit I'll
also have an asus mg279q
Windows 10 HTC vive yay should finish
off the build the obvious question are
these compatible you give me his email
address in case I need it if it isn't
compatible could you give me some advice
also your cat and Paul's dog should
fight to the death
Paul's dog would Wayne attacks dog would
certainly win and I would hope they
would so then once I've ever really knew
those cats afraid when he went I'm out
with heroes when he sees a cat hey he
hates cats
Oh what will he wants to eat we'll do
cats will do a playdate sometime yeah
yeah I can't wait
stupid cat I don't see anything that
names incompatible cousin minute I got a
graphics card a monitor storage now
you're good man he's talking about your
February Mini ITX builder my February
Mini ITX buildin we both do Mini ITX
builds in February we did so a 1080i
founders edition would fit in mine
everything else shouldn't mind you don't
mind in case I'm one fits everything the
Noctua fans would not in mine because
the Noctua fans were chosen because
they're 80 or 90 millimeter fans or
smaller mine has mine has a couple fan
mounts assuming you don't have a
liquid-cooled AIO
but um yeah look it looks pretty good
it's like it seems like a pretty good
system you're on the right track there
thank you very much max for the letter
appreciate it man yes we got alright so
this letter is not supposed to be read
on air but I will say thank you to old
grouch AKA woggs e1 zack for sending

no yeah all right
Thank You Audrey for the letter all
right let's get into the the packages
package we have packages hid packages
start with this one
all right this one is from from Court
Byron a long time watch of the show I
Maura try not to show his address here
you go Court seems like there's liquid
inside
he wanted us to do a bonus face-off
straw poll requests maybe I can do this
next week if you buy a curtain of
Neapolitan ice cream which flavor runs
up first chocolate vanilla or strawberry
you buy a carton of Neapolitan ice cream
which flavor runs out first
Oh is he basically saying which one do
you like the best yeah well I mean John
I imagine different people would have
different thoughts on that I need any oh
wait I have something I would think my
vanilla would run out the first for me
really because I don't like vanilla all
that much or not as much as the others
so I would eat it first and I have the
same and good stuff for later so you do
like I do save the best for lunch stuff
sometimes yeah I like saving the best
for like okay can you have some to look
forward to rather than dreading
something I'll be honest if I have
something like Neapolitan I try to get
an even amount of each as as I do each
serving of course because I was the best
policy because it's Neapolitan you're
meant to have all three flavors why
would you just want to scoop one up um

sad story about this I received this in

completely soaked apparently there was a
second growler in the package that
completely leaked it was empty by the
time she got to it the box was soaked
this is the letter that is entirely like
all the ink has been has been you know
what do you call it
pinks all leaked the bleeding
redistributed ink has been redistributed

leaked unfortunately is an IPA with
Alpine taste that would have been cool
Bret was it crying uh tiger crying tiger

something on your test bench water
cooling broke the two are the tubes on
your test bench from when you're when
you write when you lost your CPU correct
also can you tell me all the components
in your computer
fancy be use the works also can you make
a video on how to overclock your GPU and
CPU thanks and enjoy the gifts PS sorry
for the bad hand cracking it that's a
your more than forgiving sir thank you
very much for the letter
thanks Bart so I don't really have like
a general video on like overclocking
I've done some overclocking videos in
the past
I'll just if only someone had just
posted oh and overclocking way surely
yesterday all literally uploaded an
overclocking video on right in and so
check that end and my rise in
overclocking video could roughly apply
to an Intel platform as well just the
values would be different as far as
voltage numbers and that kind of thing
mmm-hmm but the general principles are
the same
yes and just to give you some really
quick basic specs of hot line which is
the primary desktop that I use since you
asked two gtx 980 is in sli a 69 50 X is
overclocked a four point or gigahertz
right now I believe and it's an Asus x99
sabertooth
motherboard and yeah that that it's a
good system it's good bill this is good
rig I feel great to know it's kind of
slow medium should wait and did he send
us a fan he also sent us a fan just like
a regular basic what is this HX s
120-millimeter it's just like an LED fan
perhaps so it's just a transparent LED
fan I like it
cool I'm gonna find a use for this I'm
sure and um some misses in the arrowhead
is it an arrowhead
I don't know and a Lego it's like as
there's a lego person there's a lego guy
in here this is so interesting I'm
fascinated
right now ok so there's a player 1 oh
that's kind of cool it looks like me
kind of simplify Clyde her hair so
there's a lego guy he's wearing like a
pair of cans and his shirt says player 1
maybe he got it at like Legoland or
something other nice thing um there's
just a Lego piece maybe for him to stand
on paulownia play with that we also got
this this piece of copper coil I don't
know if it's copper but it's a coil of
some sort what is that for
looks like copper yeah are you sure this
isn't just like trash copper wire that's
usable you want to get rid of and so you
just like yeah I'll give it to cow no
actually this is pretty cool this is the
arrowhead could make a motor make a
motor out of that this is an arrowhead
that's cool it looks like I does an
arrowhead was just a piece of stone
that's been shaved down into an arrow
shape it looks like a Native American
artifact yeah I think I'm gonna go spear
head fishing this weekend and then we've
also got a rock a very nice white and
black rock white and black that you know
this would match arctic Panther it was
Lee so you know if you want to uh I had
sell to you I'll sell see a sharp error
undisclosed amount we shouldn't say on
the internet we'll negotiate that after
of course and then this little magnet
magnet yeah cool thank actually does
those are really strong magnetic kind of
magnet I'm aware of think I would really
keep it away from your phone yeah good
job thank you for giving a avid computer
builder a very strong magnet I I do
appreciate that level of thoughtfulness
so I have a magnet like this and I use
it to store all of my horn all my twist
ties in your good side
I have a magnet attached to this really
yeah this is negative it's definitely a
magnet yeah ah I have the magnet
attached to just like a metal piece let
it wherever and then whenever I have
twist ties I just kind of like drop them
on it that really use it as a sports one
doesn't seem Universal doesn't seem as
strong as the one that I have have as
much pull yeah interesting but it is a
magnet it's nice and smooth nice I don't
I don't know if it's neodymium ownio
Dane Damian you man it's definitely
putting paper all right well um guys I
think that's gonna conclude mail time
thank you all so much for sending those
things in thank you it really is it
really is like Christmas morning for
Paul and I when we open stuff up and get
to see it from you especially you know
those of you who are if the amount of
are away the amount of alcohol being
sent to us increases we're gonna have a
difficult time actually drinking at all
yeah yeah definitely don't send us any
more alcohol that would be really bad
that would make for some really
entertaining content who wouldn't want
to show the world don't do that anymore
so um again this has been awesome that
concludes mail time and we can just dive
right into some of the donations that
you guys have hit us up with a tree for
the $5 donation pulp that what is the
gtx 980ti poseidon being released these
are the let these first two from the end
of my half uh or the a cos PG 278 DQ I
don't know come on vulture give I don't
know everything ASIS
aces only knows you should tweet to JJ
Asus tech marketing JJ on Twitter yep
I'd ask him and he'll probably also tell
you I'm not gonna I'm not gonna tell you
he would actually at least know and be
like I'm not gonna tell you yeah whereas
we just have no idea at all yeah I
really don't know ah next up we've got
Fred rant rant rant whose name we
pronounced so correctly that he decided
to donate $20 just for that hey
that's awesome thank you very much Fred
we appreciate that
keep keep doing you keep ranting away
yeah all right now we've got you a coal
you you you a coal you a cold you're
cold for five dollars suggestions for a
GPU for an entertainment PC or an HTTP
see that will also run the R as well
also Intel or Rison for VR um okay
you're okay with either as far as Intel
arisin yeah gtx 1070 yeah that's kind of
that's my that's the base BR 1070 that's
my base yes there are lesser GPUs that
meet the specs you can get by with a 480
or 580 or even like a 1066 gig now is
that honestly if you want the full
experience you're gonna need to have at
least a 1070 it's just yeah yep it's
like anyway any any do any type of lag
or framerate drop or anything like that
when you're in VR is so noticeable and
so distracting like you don't you don't
want to deal with it so yeah yeah um
next we've got Ematic matt again thank
you so much Matt for being a regular
donor you appreciate it thanks Paul you
guys are the real MVP also Kyle did you
ever try the VR cable management system
I tweeted you I actually do have a cable
management system for my VR headset that
I have not installed yet I'm a little
bit wary just because I'm still living
in my grandparents place I don't want to
drill too many holes in the walls and
stuff like that I have to run it by him
really quick I do have a cable kit
though that allows you to sort of
suspend the the cables from the hmd to
the ceiling and you know there's a
couple different like hooks and
carabiners and studs that have like a
rotating boom or something like that
it's not a rotating boom it's just the
matter of like where you place the hooks
and it's got some of those um
retractable you know like the badges
like the retractable badges there's a
couple of those that you can use so that
when you when you extend when you
actually walk really far away when you
walk back your the cables holding back
yeah I get it pulls the cable back these
are asking for it to be able to do that
without feeling like it's tugging on the
headset yeah it has to be just the right
amount of retention right otherwise
could pull you out of it but yes thank
you very much again for that link
automatic match I did take that consent
that suggestion next up we've got sir
Valley to the 3rd for $30 Aryans $30 you
get to an orange text because yeah a lot
um oh snap I appreciate when you get my
name right first try here's some more
samolians cool much obliged I like all
the samolians I'll take them all Luke
foot better than lukla forever for the
$5 Kyle's turn no question this time but
I'm excited about time crystals and
negative mass particles and their
applications in quantum computing art we
all who isn't I
I think it's riveting I follow up on
that every day honestly I wish I had
more to say about that I don't know
anything about that do you know I mean I
I know I know quantum computing I don't
though those are either very advanced
things that that Luke is referring to or
it's nonsense make sure it could be
either one I could very no no time
crystals silly sigh so I do time
crystals sound fascinating though I do I
want some they help you go back in time
at any rate thank you very much Luke

the telemetry and tracking I get I can
definitely empathize with I've never
used Cortana to be fair Adam died there
usually turn it off yeah I usually turn
her off

Cortana is true Jeff for the $10 thank
you very much Paul what is the gcx today
wait we already saw that one oh it's a
continuation I mean both it for a dream

going to take his donation from the
previous ethanol rehabs well um well you
already have your answer sir thank you

for the $10 I miss the first portion
because I'm a piece of
I hope this compensates of course it
does TV it does wish I could stay but I
need to go out and figure out how optics
work physics I'm just going to flip
burgers don't flip burgers TV you have a
bright future ahead of you just got to
keep your head keep your nose to the
grindstone work hard keep your nose to
the taint yeah as they say all right
next up I thank you very much TV EDX
we've got Steven gatir is for the ten
bucks hey Paul I recently built your
mini ITX bill the only difference I made
was a 1080i if you could have changed
anything about to your personal
preference what would you have changed
about your Mini ITX build that you did
recently with the Mini ITX build was it
the one in the Lian Li case yeah bless
what you put in it
uh inferior GPU I mean it was a Z 270
board it was a I don't know I think
possibly the motherboard it was as rock
board that I used which was functional
there are some nicer boards out there
that weren't available at the time when
I was getting the parts in 8270 I was
originally going to use the EVGA Z 270
stinger I think that's pretty nice board
it wasn't available when I was getting
the parts so I might have considered
something like that but I mean
functionally that has rack board worked
just fine and everything I was good so
uh yeah
actually honestly one of the changes I
would have made is dropping in a 1080 TI
instead of 1080 because that was another
thing that launched as I was parting it
out was a 1080i so I like your option of
putting that in there in the founders
edition so does my grandfather so cool
yeah I'm glad you I'm glad you like that
build I thought it was really cool built
actually it was really nice missile
system there that look that I loved that
case leonie cases be
I mean if you can get over the price of
course as is dead Liam Dennison yeah
that's you know full aluminum tempered
glass is the quality is pretty top-notch
that was a nice nice bill I did enjoy
that one and then next up we've got one
from Brandon and red and H hidden fried
bucks thank very much Paul I saw your
570 X build and I'm interested in the
case is the lack of a rear exhaust fan a
problem for airflow or should I purchase
some 120 as well Brandon I would say
that very much depends on the hardware
that you have inside that system by and
large you should be ok if you have a lot
of hardware in there if you've got like
a really high-end CPU and you've got
like a couple GPUs or something like
that then then yeah I would say add the
extra exhaust beyond that though there's
gaps all over that case since the the
tempered glass pieces are held kind of
separate from the case itself so I don't
think airflow is too much of an issue as
long as you've got some decent exhaust
you should be fine but like I said if
you got a lot of hardware in there then
then yeah I would I would add the extra
airflow you good to do test to see like
you know is there any difference on your
CPU thermals or something like that with
without an exhaust fan at the back it'd
be kind of a cool test nice to test you
can always reality check yourself and
yes and then there's another one also
from Brandon Hinman yes ed not sure if
my question was sent in the same
question yeah Thank You Brandon for
donating twice yeah and and on that note
those are all the donations that I'm
