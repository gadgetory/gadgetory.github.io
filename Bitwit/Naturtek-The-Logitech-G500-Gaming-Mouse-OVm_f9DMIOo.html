today's program follows a creature with
enough precision to headshot its enemies
from a distance commandeer a fighter jet
and open a folder reaching speeds of up
to fifty seven hundred dpi this
perplexing specimen is fearless and
unrelenting despite its heightened
sensitivity join us now as we examine
the fascinating life of the Logitech G
500
the mousepad is an unforgiving habitat
that sustains little to no wildlife
within its dry in barren landscape but
like the impervious honey badger the G
500 don't care this gaming mouse spends
most of its life aimlessly patrolling
this deserted wasteland as it only
possesses peripheral vision making it
blind to its surroundings here we see a
gathering of three blind mice see how
they run see how they run
however the G 500 has a trick up its
sleeve to find its bearings while tails
of sharks with laser beams on their
heads are a mere fantasy the existence
of a mouse with a laser beam on its tank
is a real phenomenon this characteristic
is what gives the G 500 its sense of
sight and ultimately a fighting chance
at survival to prove his dominance over
a weaker device the male G 500
challenges its contender to a deadly
speed game of cat and mouse once the
slower contender falls prey to the
feline the G 500 wins his title of alpha
among the group as well as the affection
of an observing female though her mind
is made up and she is ready to mate the
G 500 spins his scroll wheel at an
accelerated rate boasting to her his
ability to move up and down really fast
the mating process is cold and
mechanical until much to the females
relief the G 500 releases a heavy load
and ends the ritual
shortly before exiling her from
pad the rest of her day will be spent
contemplating her morals identity and
poor life choices this has been an
inside look at the logitech g502 sure to
let us know which specimen you'd like to
see next on nature tech thank you and
good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
