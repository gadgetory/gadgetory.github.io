for the NVIDIA GeForce super cards and I
am just now getting them on embargo day
the resisting mishap I guess Nvidia
forgot to send mine out I just decided
to do a quick little unboxing and maybe
we can have some fun with these cards I
don't know this is actually never
happened to me before I usually get
things pretty early so but here Hey look
at that alright let's get these out okay
so we've got the RT X 2070 super RT X
2060 super I'm not benchmarking these
because I just have there's no way I can
possibly benchmark these and still get
the video up today so if you want to see
actual benchmarks which are gonna be
much more useful than anything in this
video I'll put some links to my friends
down below don't cut yourself don't cut
yourself the world needs you not really
but that's just something you tell
yourself to sleep at night okay 2016
haha okay I did briefly catch him some
rendered images of these cards and
briefly saw them in some other youtuber
videos but look at that it's got sort of
a shiny finish super reflective is that
is it a good thing is this is this like
an artsy way of video telling you that
you are super there's a super person
inside of all of you now that would be
super stupid 26-day a super I would
imagine the r-tx 2070 looks exactly like
that except it says 2070 super look at
the backplate it also says super that's
just that's just super honey the super
cards are here oh she does want to be
the video sorry so I think the question
here is what do you do when you have a
product arrive on embargo day you can't
test the product and there's really no
time to do anything that might have
value so I guess this video is just
gonna show you guys what happens when I
receive an actual product on embargo day
and don't have the capacity or bandwidth
to do anything interesting with it
actually we're gonna walk and talk as I
grab something really quick for lunch so
the cards that are all launching today
our founders edition GPUs they're based
on the same cooler and Shroud design as
the cards before them however we are
going to start to see some custom board
partner variants launch as well in case
you're looking for a much cooler
experience you know it's kind of
interesting that Nvidia would launch
these cards right before AMD launches
their rx fifty seven hundred and fifty
seven hundred XT GPUs that sounds like a
load of garbage to me so far the
benchmarks show that the RT X 2060 20 70
and twenty eighty super offer a nice
bump in performance over their non super
counterparts however the RT X 2060 super
is the only card
three that improves its memory bandwidth
and capacity going from six to eight
gigabytes which would hopefully give it
the competitive advantage that it needs
against the upcoming competition the way
that you can look at performance of
these cards is that they're just about
as fast as the non-super versions above
them for example the r-tx 2060 super is
almost as fast as in RTX 2070 a 2070
super is almost as fast as in RTX 2080
and the r TX 2080 super is well still
not nearly as fast as a 2080 ti due to
the price gap speaking of which Nvidia
is pricing these super cards very
aggressively in order to compete
directly with AMD SRX 5700 series
needless to say the landscape of the GPU
market is really starting to heat up so
we just hired gardeners for the first
time yesterday and they completely
obliterated our lemon tree that used to
be really nice and full when we first
moved in but hey this is gonna give it
an opportunity to grow in a new
direction and probably be a better tree
overall it's kind of like how I wish
Nvidia had taken this launch as an
opportunity to branch off and do
something different so there you have it
guys that's pretty much all I could fit
into the limited amount of time I had to
get a video on this product up on launch
day I'll be doing a full review of the
super cards and how they stack up
against AMD's rx 5700 series GPU is once
those arrived July 7th if you don't want
to miss and make sure you subscribe to
the channel now before it's too late
it's very non-committal and not scary at
all unless you're a huge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
