channel today's video is going to be
super quick because I've got a lot of
stuff to do this weekend I'm actually
going to Vegas with Paul and a bunch of
other friends so follow the pollen I on
Twitter you might be posting some crazy
pictures of us going wild you know like
I don't know
unboxing things in places we shouldn't
where we're just reveled like that but
anyway this is going to be a really
quick to the point video essentially
what we're doing today is a rendering
showdown we're going to be encoding the
same Adobe Premiere Pro cs6 project on
two different systems the first one is
the razor blade Pro which is from the
folks over at razor and it features a
core i7 6700 HQ which is a mobile
processor it also has a GTX 1080 in it
which is a fully fledged desktop varying
GPU that's sandwiched into a very slim
form factor you can go ahead and watch
my review on the razor blade pro that I
posted a few weeks back if you want more
information on that book today we're
going to be hitting that against a
desktop equivalent as close as I could
get it honestly once again I'm using the
N case m1 that was featured in
February's PC of the month
however the internals had been swapped
out a bit mainly the CPU cooler and
graphics cards so for graphics card we
actually have a full GTX 280 that's
going to compete with the 1080 that's in
the razor blade Pro and for the CPU we
still have a 7700 K in there that we
will not be overclocking I didn't have a
6700 K on hand that would have been a
slightly more equal test between the two
systems but I don't have it on hand
that's actually available so we're going
Katie Lake vs. skylake mobile versus
desktop obviously that's the best
matchup that I can do right now but
we're not going to be overclocking the
7700 K and I've actually disabled turbo
boots so it's only going to be hitting
its out-of-the-box frequency of 4.2
gigahertz but I think the question we're
trying to answer today is can the razor
blade pro keep pace with a desktop
version of itself and I say that loosely
because again mobile CPU versus desktop
CPU that's going to be a huge difference
memory configurations are slightly
different we've actually got double the
RAM capacity on our laptop than we do on
our Mini ITX system here so 32 gigs on
the razorblade Pro 16 gigs on the
Desktop however I've only allocated 8
gigs per system for the rendering tasks
within Premiere Pro it's actually a
setting you can adjust within the
software so that'll be even across the
board everything else will probably have
very minimal impact on performance for
this particular test but there you go
those are the that's what we're dealing
with here obviously everything is stock
frequency on both systems both CPU and
GPU you can't even overclock anything on
the laptop for that matter so that's all
nice and dandy drivers all the latest
drivers are installed as well as Windows
10 64 bit on both systems so yeah on
that notes let's just go ahead and kick
it off with the rendering test with a 4k
clip this is actually a 4k project this
is one of my actual projects that I
worked on recently that is about five
minutes long sport Kay we're doing 45
megabits per second as our encoding
bitrate and h.264 and all that jazz so
now further ado here is the render test
begin
all right so a pretty crushing victory
for our desktop here it actually
rendered out the project in 12 minutes
and 2 seconds compared to the laptop
which was significantly slower at 18
minutes and 33 seconds to be exact
that's 54 percent longer of an encoding
time than our desktop so why did this
happen Kyle where did things go wrong
well nothing really went wrong I think
my original speculation and all this
before I started the test it's pretty
correct and that the CPU differences
here between IPC s and speeds is quite
drastic when you're talking about a 6700
HQ which is a best mobile chip in its
own right but compare that to a desktop
variant core i7 that's clocked over 4
gigahertz there really is a huge
difference in performance there
especially in the tasks like rendering
where you're not just taxing the GPU but
the CPU is also being heavily heavily
utilized now I would say that the
performance gap overall between these
systems would probably close quite a bit
if we were to throw a gaming test in
here at 4k for example because at that
point even 2560 by 1440 your more GPU
bound at that point so the CPU really
isn't being taxed at all and it's not
really a limiting factor for the razor
blade Pro at that point because all the
focus is GPU bound however when you're
talking about rendering both the CPU and
GPU at least in our case today are being
taxed fairly evenly and much more evenly
so than in a gaming 4k for example so we
were really able to expose any sort of
weaknesses or slow down with that mobile
CPU in our render test today so another
factor to consider here is that laptops
are generally way more constrained
thermally than desktops are so the
manufacturers of these laptops like
Razer or whoever else is assembling
anything whether it's HP Dell whatever
they kind of know this going into it
especially like the gaming laptops in
particular so they might not allow the
hardware to ramp up or just go balls to
the wall and deliver the utmost
performance
below because they want to keep things
thermally controlled whereas a desktop
that's sort of more in the users hands
that the hardware is just allowed to go
as as as fast as it can go
as long as the thermal conditions are in
place so that can have a lot to do with
why we saw a bit of this collaborative
performance today as well before I go I
don't want people to watch this video
and think well there's really no place
for the razor blade Pro it's not nearly
as fast as a somewhat equivalent desktop
solution so why the hell would you even
buy and to that I will say there is a
fairer way to test this not that I have
time to do today but hear me out I'll
leave you with this thought if we were
to test this again in a more fair
overall all-encompassing manner I would
want to see how long it would take to
set up a full desktop including the the
PC itself monitor keyboard mouse all the
cables all that stuff I'd like to see
how long how many seconds would that
take and then how many seconds would it
takes to tear down and pack it up nicely
so that you were able to just walk out
the door with everything in hand versus
the time it takes to close a laptop and
stick it in a backpack and zip it up so
really I mean I think at the end of the
day it's like where do you want your
time to be saved in the rendering
process during that period or in the
travel process if you're going from A to
B constantly it does not make much sense
to opt for a desktop solution even
though it might be 50 60 % faster than a
laptop equivalent so I just want to bear
that in mind for all of you and again
that's pretty much all I have time to
talk about today sorry if this video is
super rushed it totally is but hopefully
you still kind of enjoyed it a little
bit if you did be sure to toss me a like
on the video and subscribe to the
channel for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon which it certainly is
as always I'm Kyle big let's thank y'all
for tuning in and I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
