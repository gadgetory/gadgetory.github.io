just in time
hello wife is us yeah a knee down all
the troll heard some news about wifey
sauce but I can't talk about
it'll be on TMZ tomorrow matter of time
I told him I told we should we should be
live to YouTube though all right cool
hey welcome everyone this is awesome
hardware you are watching episode 168
man we're almost at 169 which is like
what there's an episode I always aspired
to I was like I hope before I before we
die we hit 169 and looks like we're
going to unless one of us dies within
the next seven days that would be tragic
it's a morbid thought yeah it was and
that's how we're gonna start the show
is it the Halloween show it's the
Halloween show death you know and we're
dressed up as ourselves I forgot to
dress up
good we do have a pumpkin though I'm
just a meta I'm like a super meta right
now there was a pumpkin they dressed as
Kyle get it carve the pumpkin I might
have to the show
oh yeah pumpkin carving in about half an
hour or so and thank you for joining us
this is the Halloween special episode
it's not really much special about it
and then being close shall we have pie
we die we're carving things
jack-o'-lanterns and we have we have we
have dead things pictures of that we had
on our beer cam Halloween themed beer
say this Halloween edition right
automatically right now I'm finishing up
a deadpan Pilsner would see their skulls
on the on the can from wines Brewing
Company this is a lager that's they're
going to make it says lager Oh what
Pilsner or lager lager I'm sure why not
when your dad it doesn't matter I have a
dead guy ale from rogue brewing there's
a little Skelton on here too he looks
cold
yep probably cuz the beers just served
ice ball it should be did get you so
thank you very much for tuning in um
occasionally we will swear we will use
the don't language hearing there on the
show only when it's warranted though
Pilsener is a type of lagers the current
okay i don't you think
thinking beer that I know about actual
beer this has been proven so yeah if you
have little ones that are sensitive
hearing be warned this we do have some
adult language sprinkled into the show
only for good for good reason though we
also sell things on our merchandise
stores I have a site called bit wit tech
and he go there you can find shirts
hoodies but mugs that scared me I got it
I've got PTSD fenner you know control
just anything about bottles or glasses
or beer on this show just freaks me out
now give me massive anxiety so uh
biblioth√®que go go there now and buy
everything
stay positive sweaters this is to stay
positive hoodies sale hoodies we got a
sale on the big win hoodies because you
know it's a holidays and stuff yep 37
bucks for a high quality hoodie there's
also the evolution very very popular the
evolution I think is the most popular
designed for the bottle openers we've
been selling a lot of those as well oh
yeah and I think we just got some more
in stock so go buy something from there
and go to Paul store as well Paul's
hardware net Paul Harbor dotnet where he
sells lowly things like beanies like
these organic cotton beanies super super
and just got these restocked
is it cold where you live right now I
bet it is these these were I had these
last year last year but also somebody
specifically requested these just
recently and I was like oh I feel like
I'm on top of that because it's they're
already coming in yeah I also got
keycaps for some life I've also got
these lovely glasses that were drinking
out of today on yeah which are in by the
way are empty would you probably
populate these glasses with that let's
so the third beer that we have here this
is the special is have a calabaza boreal
calabaza boria collaboration so this is
by Anchorage Brewing Company in
collaboration with jolly pumpkin artisan
ales and if you can't tell when I was
shopping for beer today I was looking
for stuff that had like skulls on it or
this one has a jack-o'-lantern
great festive we could not be more
festive than we are right now al
fermented and oak tanks with fresh
grapefruit grapefruit peel peppercorns
and fresh grapefruit juice so this is
going to be a little on the grapefruity
side I'm imagining
can I open it yes you may hi Ellie I've
learned to face many must face our fears
and overcome them that's right I see you
guys donating money's in super chat that
is never there's never never required
but always appreciated we will be
reading off all donations will go to my
eye Recovery Fund ooh I'm getting better
and feels disempowering I know I was
only slightly nervous so and we will be
reading all messages that you attach to
those donations at the end of the show
during the after-party
that's how we do things now so thank you
very much into it in advance for your
donations after-party will also be
streamed on YouTube so yep everything's
also streamed to YouTube and twitch is
that's our I mean it's got grapefruits
oh it smells like a sour it is I'm
excited but we might not be hey I can
handle a sour my sours the new IPAs for
you foam no no the song he's like I hate
IPA he's my favorite why isn't that a
shirt yet we'll pull the audience and
see if people want a shirt that says
that I can I need more designs on my on
my store actually new design is coming
along nice I haven't looked at the first
article for the day is from hot heavy
heart know it's hot hard work hard work
heavy hair wears a different segment so
this is about the AME Radeon rx 590
that's been confirmed to carry the
FinFET 12 nanometer architecture so that
I'd say this has been confirmed by a
leaked image apparently from andreas
Schilling it's funny the the word shill
is in his last night he'll probably take
ten with a grain of salt
he's an editor at German site hall where
Lux I'm guessing that means hardware
something in German he's posted photos
of an actual retail box with some specs
he's apparently
reputable guy who's not like known for
like doing crazy leaks and stuff and
being super sketchy so this seems like
it would just hurt him if it was a false
or or leaked photo if it wasn't credible
so a lot of people are actually giving
this photo quite some credit but again
rumor is until it comes straight from
the horse's mouth we've got a couple
images here one is actually of the the
sort of sort of front here it says RX
590 a nice Radeon branding there and the
other than nine nine yeah is different
it's one more than an eight which we
have not seen before people and this is
news this is a sour eight is now nine oh
is it really
it's not super sour though hmm oh yeah
it's mild it's mild sour mild sir okay
so um anyway there's also a second
picture here that actually highlights
some of the technology features I
wouldn't call them specs per se but we
do get some confirmation again grain of
salt that the the RX 590 is gonna
feature freesync to HDR technology
Radeon chill Radio and realize relived
capturing stream FinFET twelve I think
is the big one here that's the one that
made the headline and HDR ready DirectX
12 and Vulcan optimized of course so
this confirms a lot of the rumors that
have been floating around in the last
couple weeks maybe even months that this
is gonna be a refresh yet again another
refresh of polaris just on 12 nanometer
which is pretty exciting now the other
additions that we might see to the RX
590 here is increased clock speed
because of that net nanometer or that
architecture change as well as maybe a
bit of a boost in power efficiency I
would say are they're probably the two
main features that we might see from
this new cart again it's not SuperDuper
exciting because it is you know it's
just a refresh but you know NVIDIA seems
to meet only tackling the the high-end
market for now so maybe this is a nice
stopgap between some of the more
entry-level budget options and say like
at RT X 2070 it'll be interesting to see
what kind of pricing AMD rolls out with
this as well and then we don't have the
exact clock speeds or any real-world
performance obviously that's to be
determined for
be November I think November 15th is the
rim would launch date again all rumors
but perhaps mid next month we'll be
seeing this card actually on store
shelves and it'll probably be more
accessible than any of the r-tx cards so
that's it that's it for the rx5 dandy
guys let's move on anything to comment
there Paul mmm I'm curious what the
price is if if it can be sub 300 bucks
like that would be cool I mean I would
hope it's speedy even if it's well under
they I think if they can bring it in 250
considering that you can get 5 80s in
the low 200s right now yeah that would
be a nice option I mean you see how much
faster you know it might be a little bit
be able to clock a little bit better and
a little bit more efficient to old
nanometer instead of 14 I hope so you
would expect to see sort of a similar
difference I
I mean probably not linear but like if
you look at first gen rising versus 2nd
gen rising you get a little bit more
clock speed yeah yeah so there ya better
clocks baby alright moving on we've got
an article from WCC of tech here you
guys pay attention to this if you have
an EMV card or maybe if you're planning
to buy an RX 590 and you want to save
some coin on a freesync panel these ones
these new ones these v2 panels from AOC
are aiming at the budget market below
$100 I that's crazy
AOC is one of those sort of budget
brands that actually is known to make
some pretty decent stuff so it's not
like a throw away just trash Treach ran
off the bat they actually have three
monitor models that are coming that are
actually available now 22 inch 24 inch
and 27 inch I think that's a good range
you know if you've got a really small
desk versus you know a lot of space 27
inches pretty good actually
unfortunately all these panels are 1080p
1920 by 1080 but what can you really
expect for a sub 100 hundred dollar
panel yeah I guess also free sync
obviously but not just that we're
getting IPS displays and the belt into
these panels it's pretty thin super sexy
I mean I would not guess if this was a
100
all our panelists to get one of these
into the studio and actually feel it
sort of do a bend test they put the
ports and I love the way they did that
that's actually really smart that seems
like a great idea I haven't seen anyone
do that I'm having to like she'd find
out where they go like look on your
monitor it also the size of these ports
and the fact that they need to be
plugged be able to be plugged into a
bunch of different times so for whatever
the rating is for the plug like means it
needs to be mounted to a sturdier place
on the stand so a lot of times I'm
monitors like you'll see like a bulge or
something at the back to accommodate
those because like you physically can't
mount them to something this thin yeah
so that's it's a good idea yeah and
obviously you know these these aren't
meant to be wall-mounted they can't be
there's no base amounts or anything and
especially with how the ports are laid
out you all need to keep them fixed to
the stand
but the Stan looks like it's got some
some decent adjustability there was no
details on that but it looks pretty good
and I mean under 100 bucks no that's
probably for the 22 inch model oh wait
actually yes it is for the 22 inch model
it's $99.99
129 bucks for the 24 inch and 170 for
the 27-inch 170 bucks for an IPS
freesync panel though that looks this
good and has that slim of bezels is
really great and I think this is also a
good option if you want to do like
virtual surround or like a triple panel
display because the bezels are so thin
you're not going to have a bunch of
black bars on the sides or whatever and
you could get away with spending less
than you know around 500 bucks for for
all three 27-inch panels $300 this
triple pane is free sync work and
surround that would be a big question
also like I don't mean the middle I
don't know how many people are about to
drop money on three 1080 monitors right
now yeah and I mean I'm just trying to
play doubles out because here also big
27 inch 1080 is is not the best
combination yeah I would say 1440 at the
very least for that since it's it's okay
but 1440 is a nice step up in resolution
but I feel like I feel like you're right
let's say you had 22 inch cell says that
yes it does it steals for all three
freesync does every sync and surround oh
as a cell says I'm get he says yes it
does so he
you're talking about difference who
could be responded to someone in chat
but I'm gonna take his word for it cell
cell processing our moderator who is
always right about everything has
confirmed
freesync 3-way monitor setups absolutely
will always work for you Salim knows his
three ways and you'll have no problem
getting it set up and working properly
either that's right
plug and play plug it plug it baby
thanks oh uh yeah let's see anything
else to say about this nope let's move
on all right
so there's an article from ARS technica
our Technica is really good about like
always pointing out with ARS technica
yeah I know I I started saying ARS
technica because that's our Eastern
saying it I'd well originally originally
but then but then I realize up for being
called ARS technica what does the ARS
stand for them alternative reality
syndrome is it really I have no idea I
was like that's that's quirky I dig it
probably does mean - okay so anyway
Technica it likes to put out articles
any time they see tesla screwing up
which I very much appreciate gotta keep
him honest it seems like there are more
and more Tesla's on the road these days
and here's here's a Tesla free road
here's what a road looks like no Tesla's
driving on it this is this was life
about ten years ago before before Tesla
this is actually where a crash occurred
so yes that's what he's very depressing
okay so let's listen just that it's so
innocently there's a lawsuit here um the
autopilot technology steered a
stationary or steered a car into a
stationary object on the freeway
fortunately the driver is alive but he's
suing Tesla because he's claiming that
he was told by a Tesla rep or a Tesla
dealer that all he had to do with the
cars autopilot grapefruit was was was
touch the steering wheel every now and
then when you're on the freeway and the
car would do the rest so it sounds like
for the most part a hands-off technology
like he just you said it and forget it
type of thing but that wasn't really the
case this guy named Hudson I wonder if
that's really just his full name cuz I
never said if that was like they never
gave like a - name name he was just
known in this article
like Madonna or Cher Hudson McLovin
yeah sure I could dig it so anyway he
said that he was on his way to work he
has a to our work commute makes sense
why you'd want a Tesla that's advertised
as having foolproof hands-off automation
sure and then he was just relaxing on
his way to work and then BAM his car ran
in to a parked car that was that was
actually left in the left shoulder and
it just slammed it like it was a Ford
Fiesta or something like that and yeah
the guy the guy sustained some minor
injuries but he survived surprisingly
apparently this is an issue that Tesla
have seen before in their cars it says
that the system isn't designed to stop
parked cars but or other stationary
objects when traveling at highway speeds
this year at least 200 other Tesla
drivers have plowed into parked cars
while using autopilot another another
person was killed when his car remember
this story I think we talked about it
earlier a while back when he ran into a
concrete lane divider at full speed on
the highway I remember actually talking
about that it might be on my half so
Hudson crashed
October 12th he was driving 80 miles an
hour too so it could have been fatal if
it was anything more or less movable or
more solid than you know another car he
was driving Haiti or he was going over
his Tesla was driving hitting his Tesla
sounds like it's the cars fault right
the way this is being described
and Tesla puts continues to put zero
blame on their their vehicles or their
technology their their autopilot
technology it seems like any time an
instance like this happens they
immediately shift focus and blame onto
the driver saying they weren't using the
autopilot feature as its intended to be
used which that's the whole reason why
this guy is suing because he said the
dealer told him all you need to do is
like touch the wheel every now and then
and you'll be good set it and forget it
apparently not setting it and forgetting
it equals costing your life apparently
or potentially can so this guy might get
some buku bucks from Tesla who knows
which will be bad for Tesla cuz that
they're already hemorrhaging money as we
speak umm now they're actually doing
are they getting fine now well that they
were their most recent reports they're
they're back making money okay cuz I
remember they weren't turning much of a
profit earlier but it's good to hear
that the church that I saw were relative
to the the main launches that they've
done the different moms that they made
them all three and then the Model S and
Model X previously yeah and there's
always like lose money lose money loses
money lose money launch lose money lose
money and then make money and then they
would go back to lose money lead up to
another launch and then they'd make
money again okay so I yeah I haven't
looked at it that closely though so you
have the company in stocks
what no sounds like Darth Vader's those
are stones watering like water or eating
I'm sure it's nothing to be concerned
about explosion he said and took another
sip of his beer so um I don't know let's
go on Tesla and it's interesting you
know Elon Musk has always said that you
know by having their automated
technology autopilot technology that it
would save millions of lives or at least
hundreds of thousands of lives every
year and say that's what the articles
not taking into account is how many
lives have been saved already which is
probably nearly an infinite amount it's
a really controversial topic and it's
kind of thought-provoking because at the
same time certain accidents are
happening happening with autopilot
enabled that a human would otherwise
never get into probably like that guy
would probably not have driven into that
parked Ford Fiesta on the side the right
it don't work for autopilot it also
seems a little bit like you're trying to
sort of skirt the rules for how the
autopilot is supposed to work if you're
trying to do the minimum amount of you
action to keep it functional right my
god I just got to touch the steering
wheel every so often that's like oh yeah
I don't have a direct comparison but I'm
like moving the mouse every so often to
keep the computer going to sleep that's
yeah they like like I'm pretty sure when
you use autopilot there's probably some
and I'm doing taking the Tesla side here
obviously this there's but there's
probably some you know
with some instructions for how to use it
and you know that you are still supposed
to be there and attentive and everything
and paying some attention but the
running into park card is that there's
no real excuse for that though that yeah
that seems like it something they they
should fix so yeah if they tell you
they're designing the autopilot software
in like right it's like a person walks
in front like it'll dodge and like this
car drives by and like it'll get around
and check all that and it's like it's
like what about this thing and cycads
name in movie no I'm worried about but
yeah and it's really also kind of
concerning with the way that like how
how like car dealers make money based on
Commission how its kind of like cut
there and we'll sort of say anything
let's just the bottom line is all that
matters we'll just say anything to sell
the car and so unfortunately in this
case saying whatever you want just to
sell that car could custom on their life
if you're telling them hey you know you
can you can pretty much set it and
forget it and and they do and and
they're not there to actually steer it's
your weight ah that's what that saw my
neighbors saw its saw yeah buzz saw yeah
alright something I don't know it's
probably a miter saw or something like
that but yeah okay second man let's come
back there but bouncing through the
window and like there's and it was sunny
weird if he has his own you know Dan's
hardware also like it's Halloween since
a cure that's like what's a nice Michael
Myers okay so that's enough about Tesla
it's everything for the inside everyone
go buy one and use autopilot extensively
that's the moral story there good idea
we're doing this month yeah I'll just
but so full disclosure completely my bad
but here's my feet here we go at
recycling Paul yeah okay I've got the
other two do you do oh I didn't bring
them I've got two of the three I'm just
beat you dude so full disclosure I kind
of screwed up with it so she of a
sponsor spot so they're actually getting
a little bit more sponsor coverage than
was originally planned never mind all
that those our show today is brought to
you by Toshiba hey um so you'll find
some links down in the video's
description did you put your links I
will right now Cal's gonna put his links
doing it so you'll find some links in
the description to some Toshiba products
they're all based on BICS flash memory
which is fast NAND flash memory that
they're able to make and sell products
that are not terribly expensive so
you'll find the TR 200 which is a nice
2.5 inch SSD available in various
capacities 240 gig 480 gig like the one
we have here and they always like I'm
doing a build tomorrow and I'm using the
TR 200 because I was just looking at SSD
prices and it was like it was the best
price SSD for for what I needed I just
using the OCZ RC 100 for october specie
of the month there yep which I was
supposed to set live today but I was out
doing other things so it's that videos
going up tomorrow but it features this
Drive yes because it's tiny and cute and
and relatively fast for its speed yeah
the air C 100 is a nice little super
tiny nvme jet and I can't do that it's
very durable too they can apply pressure
on it teeny tiny m to drive so nvme this
this is a 500 llego 480 gig SSD right
there so yeah pretty good very very
small xx del 7 XS 700 which is an
external 2.5 inch drive as well connect
so Kyle's got it right there USB
connects via USB C so that's nice to go
three point one as well yeah this three
point one this is a connected connection
standard Gen 2 by the way if we're being
absolutely honest the connection
standard from three to three point one
doesn't really matter with this drive
because you're talking say to speak
that's true but it still does adhere to
that standard so you know it's a sponsor
spot Paul okay sorry you're supposed to
live in one specific toshiba doesn't
care they're just they're listing the
compatibility specs on the side i'm just
giving some additional information USB
3.1 gen2 compatible and all that good
stuff okay so thank you so she before
sponsoring awesome hardware sponsor
spots you can trust
brought to you by hardware interview
we'll do that again my out of the show
yeah what's next Kyle alright except we
stole over you about games games reports
its type of game sport right I was like
wait I have this but it's what it said
and what the thing actually was this is
really like the gaming the games
Hardware report because we're talking
about hardware that pertains to games
but not necessarily games themselves
clever clad but but yeah it's all the
same sure
the first article we have here from from
hexxus is detailing the full list of the
20 PlayStation classic minigames that
have just been revealed so how like
Nintendo had their there NES classic
mini and the NES yes SNES Classic Mini
well now Playstations got one this has
been in talks for for quite a while this
logic piece is always lastic frippery
that people waste their money on instead
of just downloading and Emilee emulator
like a normal person because this is
much more legal with less grey area
involved fine it's more less likely to
get sued which has some appeal there so
there's 20 games listed with this this
unit again it's playstation the original
playstation place the ps1 classic mini
and the 20 games listed right there
let's see battle battle arena condition
old borders to destroy I haven't get the
full list but is is is wait Final
Fantasy 7 well fancy sevens on here and
the and the original Grand Theft Auto
this is the original Grand Theft Auto
I'm wondering if people are going to be
expecting something other than what this
actually is
gg-get like like a 3d open-world do you
remember the original grand yeah it's
like top down it's like top-down
2-dimensional top-down 2d and you drive
a car around
I mean I never played it that I know
there are similarities it's very you
know people there's words and stuff like
that but it's helicopter view and so
much 2d come on intelligent cube jumping
flash Metal Gear Solid I think that's
gonna be a huge seller here so a lot of
people that's a good one to have the
classic mr. driller never played that
one odd world
I haven't played most of these Abe's
Oddysee Raymond Raymond's a tried and
true classic Resident Evil director's
cut I think that's gonna be pretty big
one too there's a lot of a lot of a lot
of fanboys of that franchise myself
included revelations persona
Dreiser type 4 I've heard that's a
pretty good one speed okay super puzzle
fighter 2 turbo never played that one
Syphon Filter Syphon Filter - was
siphoned Syphon Filter was one of my
favorite titles and it's even more
favorite now this is the one that I was
looking for thank you
yeah original twisted metal Tom Clancy's
Rainbow six and Wild Arms yeah I played
the shit out of twisted metal and Syphon
Filter yeah and I believe my freshman
year of college was a decent amount of
of twisted metal oh yeah not to date
myself too much but I'm freakin old
alright alright so hundred four hundred
dollars hundred bucks pretty good deal I
would say it still remains I've seen if
you can add extra games it's funny
because when the PlayStation no I never
mind I'm thinking of Super Nintendo
never mind okay mixed up with super
Super Nintendo launched for 200 bucks
and then I'll and then I got a used one
for 80 bucks
around the time that it wants I was
within like a year of weight loss it was
still yeah I had to put I had to be on a
waiting I had to wait for like two
months on a waiting list at a comic book
store near my house that also dabbled in
videogames things come to those who wait
yeah so yeah go everyone go buy three of
those next up we've got an article about
Microsoft they're designing Microsoft
Research is does it has been designing
their project x cloud controllers so
project x cloud is kind of like
microsoft's response to to NVIDIA
GeForce now it's a gaming streaming
service it's all in all the games are
hosted on the cloud but you can play it
from virtually any device whether it be
desktop mobile and so forth which is
kind of cool now obviously mobile gaming
sucks
because okay anything that's like I
shouldn't say that if it's anything more
complex than plants vs. zombies like an
action game or a first-person shooter it
really sucks playing on mobile because
you have to rely on the touch screen on
the actual screen and sometime
you lose your your place with your
thumbs you know because you're not
exactly looking at where your thumbs are
going for example and it's just a clunky
solution for for more like you know high
end games or whatever more action games
so Microsoft Research has been designing
these controllers that are supposed to
lead is supposedly going to seemingly
integrate with mobile devices though of
course make the whole project x cloud
experience more enjoyable so what you
have here is a controller now it looks
all funky and like ugly but you can see
that it can actually it looks like a
standard controller on the left right
you can connect the two halves but also
splits splits those two halves and you
can clamp each half to your tablet
smartphone whatever for a more ergonomic
gaming sigur they say clip clipped
clipped clipped clamped whatever your
heart design
so um I think I think it's cool and it
looks like you can actually take off
those grips if you wanted to see in the
picture on the bottom there that looks
like there's no grips no handles
appreciate a modular design like that
yeah it's actually kind of a good idea
because sometimes those handles really
do take up a lot of space yeah when
you're traveling and stuff if you really
are trying to go portable and that's all
you really need is physical buttons and
a joystick I think you can grip the rest
of it most people can pretty easily with
just you know the backing of the the
tablet or smartphone anyway I do see a
issue here though it looks like the
control this doesn't mention in the
article but it just looks like in order
to clamp you know on a smaller device
it'll look it's kind of covering up some
of the screen like here yeah and you
know that might not be much of an issue
and second that's like a nut it's just
people are already but that's a totally
exotic than that I can't I can't talk
massive shit on the knotch
and then be totally okay with this I
feel like that would just be
hypocritical of me I feel like maybe
it's not as huge a deal I mean how would
you like gaming on a monitor like like
you know your Predator X 27 or something
like that and then having like an inch
or two of just screen real estate gone
from the sides
I know it's peripheral and all but I
don't know it still it still makes a
difference probably even more so on a
small screen like that it doesn't look
like it's covering much of anything
that third picture there but it's a
tablet there's a tablet it's got much
bigger bezels that's probably why I
think the bezel the bezel thinness could
have a backfiring effect so let's say
this is demonstrating the benefit of
thicker bezels yeah go by go buy a
mobile device with super thick bezels
there now back there now in there now in
again super in so um yeah
I don't know it'll be interesting have
you tried out GeForce now mmm no I mean
that's I think that's where we're headed
I feel like console gamers are gonna hop
on these services before PC gamers do
because it'll be a while before bang
that's the camera oh no I bet here I did
that is the camera off cameras on oh
then I think that cell messaging let me
just press this button here Oh what did
you get sound is still functional
yeah can you um plug the HDMI and then
put a second from everything
oh I came back for a second you did wait
all right we're back yay good job Kyle
yay well then bad bad dog you're still
cute though
oh did he do that I don't think he died
okay that's just more so don't breathe
part of my half is gonna be explaining
why I might have this very poorly
playing so more more attention the whole
half more details on my half about stage
one is why things here may be good maybe
were slightly nervous about things being
fully functional for today's show let's
find that everything's fine we're back
in business and we know we now know what
to do if that happens again yes we do
alright so yeah like I was gonna say his
stream runs on hope she doesn't test
terrible uh
let's just move on we've got some more
stuff to talk about here steam Halloween
sale has started just wanted to give you
guys a quick heads up this is brought to
our attention is we need that net or
anyone who is on Steam I haven't looked
at any of the deals I should try to
carve the pumpkin like this with the
valve I bet so many people are gonna
carve one like that just because they
saw that our good idea uh yeah so um top
sellers hey looks like these are all in
your great British pounds oh good means
nothing to me I don't I wouldn't buy any
of these games although Shadow the Tomb
Raider is still going for the same price
I think of 39.99 us so good which is
down kept that busy box that's massive
34 percent that's awesome
so yeah it looks like they were all like
scary games too or like you know it's
real a suspension suspenseful games
Vampir well that would make sense it's a
Halloween special okay no we gotta have
a theme ya know rocket League can be
scary yeah I guess you scared of balls
consider your face big ball and like
you're trapped in a big arena playing
people watching you and judging you
playing with your balls I'm just playing
with your balls that's all you have to
do other people play with your balls
that's kind of sad I'm scared I'm scared
down tube jeez
guess I'm not sleeping tonight uh so
everyone go buy some games games are
good they keep us employed as well
because then you'll keep being
interested in the computers that we make
to run them alright moving on we have
one last topic for debate here this is a
very very important all right this is
serious this is serious dirt here so the
other day I tweeted I asked you guys on
Twitter if I should buy a ps4 Pro in
order to play Red Dead Redemption too
because I'm a huge fan of the the first
one and I want to play the second one
and then instead of saying yes or no it
just turned into of course this just
giant fanboy thread of whether I should
buy ps4 Pro or Xbox one X and a lot of
people were saying I mean there was just
I mean good good arguments on both sides
really but at the end of the day I went
with an Xbox one X as you can see right
there Paul's brought it up about the X
x1x and of course there's a flood of
people saying yeah and other people
saying no so I want to ask you guys
right now right here live okay did I
make the right choice by buying an Xbox
one x over a ps4 pro for Red Dead
Redemption to remember and buy this this
console I was gonna buy either these
consoles specifically for this title
okay does it look better on the
PlayStation 4 Pro so apparently is that
people say okay here's what sold me on
the Xbox one X is that it natively plays
this particular title at 4k 30fps
whereas ps4 does some weird mumbo-jumbo
- I don't know if I want to say upscale
but it's not true 4k but it's you know
so it doesn't look quite as crispy
probably as I'm scaling probably so it
doesn't look quite as crispy as the
Internet or it's probably rendering at a
slightly lower resolution scaling up to
4k okay sure so I just wasn't sure but
so and that pretty much sold me the
thanks box 1x also plays 4k blu-ray
their 4k blu-ray it is a 4 weight expa
ps4 pro does not I don't know about the
pro pro probably does I mean I have no
idea I don't know I have a very but you
know what else not any on the experts
when X is the fact that I really love
the Xbox one controller it's a good
control I do not like the PlayStation 4
controller at all and there are products
there are devices that adapters you can
use the support Pro doesn't do 4k
blu-ray says Chet I was waiting for
Thank You Chet that's in a whole other
reason because I would love this to be a
sort of it's like even my reason why I
got my Xbox one yeah right good yeah
because you know there is no native
blu-ray support on on Windows 10 and
it's a real pain in the ass to try to
play entered a blu-ray through a
third-party software yeah I've struggled
with that for years so it's kind of nice
that I had that option now but the other
thing that I think the strongest
argument for the ps4 Pro side was was
the exclusive titles everyone was saying
oh my god the exclusives though did you
tell people to vote in this yeah
I I dropped a link in chat every chat
vote on a cow's truffle the exclusive
title everyone's saying that who's the
tiles piece for though my thing is what
are the exclusive titles
I think shadow zero Don zero shadow
shadow zero Don no horizon horizon zero
dawn zero dawn shadow from share this
fing Raider so horizon zero dawn is
supposed to be incredible another game
that hasn't released yet but is very
promising so far is the last of us to
sort of building on the the popularity
and success of the the seat prequel this
is all the Zelda games
no not Zelda games it's all switch so
there's there are some competitor man
God of War by the man God God of War I
didn't play the God of War three back in
the day that was amazing I did see quite
a bit of scuttlebutt about spider-man
yeah
various yeah so much but but but the
scuttlebutt to all this is that I don't
really have time to play many games
there there might be 10,000 great
exclusives on ps4 but I will probably
only have time to play one of them a
year at the rate that just probably goes
for YouTube especially since you're
gonna be trying to play through Final
Fantasy 7 on your new PlayStation Mini
that's exactly right you know and that's
gonna take I'm not a several hundred
hours in a parallel process that shit
I'm not a GPU so I can only play one
game at a time and I rarely ever have
time to game and I really just want to
play ready redemption - not interested
in the exclusives let alone have time
for them so so tell me what have you
played it like you did you just I I
showed a video on it recently so I
didn't really play I played like the
first half an hour but it was I was
shooting a video this is always my my
like whenever I think to myself like oh
I played a video game I'm like no I play
a video game for video yeah I played
that game at all outside of the context
of shooting or capturing footage for the
video right if the answer is no then I
did not play I didn't play it but see my
plan usually I used it for the purposes
of video production my plan is to
actually play it though
it does that's another thing lots of
people talking about that you get off
your horse and then punch at the face
and the court horse kicks you in the
face and it's a very it's a body
experience I mean it's worth it right
there quite a few times 500 bucks right
there worth it so let's see what you
guys thought on the straw poll yeah did
I make the right choice going with Xbox
one X / ps4 Pro for Red Dead Redemption
- oh okay results let's try this if this
could be r2d2 but not exactly and of
course I had to slip in that sort of
funny funny answer there and they better
make fucking for it but it looks like
Xbox one X wins this one is well over
double you made the right choice Cal yay
and this is this was tested and sort of
objectively looked at that Xbox one X
did have the better graphics it looked
better and performed a little bit better
than the ps4 Pro and all the other
consoles for that matter across the
board so those reasons science that I
picked the right console thank you guys
for weighing in on that well then
alrighty that's all that's all for my
hat yay holy moly thank you guys so much
but don't go anywhere because we're
gonna switch over to Paul's have you can
find a link to his hat in the
description if you're watching us on
YouTube or stay where right where you
are if you're watching on twitch on TV
so I saw some hardware thanks guys we
were back I had a cook thing and then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
