waiting for bit wit waiting for bit wit
how are there are two dislikes that is
some bullshit
hey we're alive hey how's it going
everyone welcome welcome welcome back to
the channel
friends and family mostly friends hello
today we're gonna play some some
fortnight yeah we just got home from
work and now I guess we're doing more
work by gaining wifey sauce is here whoa
that was really weird because for a
split second I saw you on the stream and
you were still sitting back in that
chair and I thought that you had like
cloned yourself or something I'm it's
been a long day but hey how's it going
everyone I see you all in chat how does
the stream look and sound OH
echoes bad okay you you have muted me
you have muted me right
you better mute I'm gonna I'm gonna have
to mute to you cuz we're in the same
room boom because they're hearing me
through your mic so alright
echo should be gone for the most part
hold on one sec low audio okay cool
done - done done mic is low gotta go -
yeah working on the audio right now how
about now check one two testing testing
check one two
can you hear me people and how does it
sound against the background the gaming
the game in game sound you're hearing an
echo did you mute me in this chord you
better you better damn it
alright cool mic volume is still low
echo is gone but
as far as the mics low okay let's go
ahead and blast your guys's ears out are
you ready are you ready don't say I
didn't warn you you might wanna you
might want to take your headphones off
just for your sec boom okay maybe that's
clipping a little bit check check check
check one two testing check alright how
does it sound loud buzzing some say
slight buzz other people say no buzz wow
it is really difficult to read hundreds
of messages at this rate buzzing got
louder oh that's probably because I
cranked up the microphone boost alright
so microphone boost has been set back
down levels on the microphone are now at
100 and I can up the volume here with in
OBS hopefully that sounds better
check one two you much better much
better
Wow it's funny how you guys all say the
same thing at the same time it's like
you it's like it's like a hive mentality
alright check one two check check what
what what you need
well I would just say you could just
exit this court because there's really
no point they can hear you through my
mic it'll be quiet but just just use
your loud your loud voice you're loud
and proud voice like you like pretend
like you're mad at me which shouldn't be
very difficult because you tend to get a
little bit louder when you're mad okay
well I don't need to be in here either
I'm closing it out by discord okay let's
let's play some freaking video games but
first first rule of order is we drink
and I actually have waifu sauce and I
took a pit stop at a very nice beer
store on our way here I'm drinking el
segundo power plant it is a triple IPA I
don't think I've ever had a triple IPA
I've had lots of doubles but this is a
triple IPA a Tippa you should ask Paul
about IPAs everyone go tweet Paul and
say hey Paul why do you hate IPAs and
and watch the rage ensue well rage for
Paul anyway you know you probably won't
be able to tell that he's pissed beyond
belief
what what difficulties is wyfy sauce
having typical wifey issues
well that doesn't really help me out
very much but this is a 12.3% beer so I
will drink it conservatively if you guys
would like to be mean but also kind of
nice at the same time feel free to
donate in chat using a YouTube super
chat there is no obligation you do not
need to donate anything I will be happy
as a clam whether or not you do but
donations are always appreciated and
let's just say for I can't do cuz
there's so many people watching right
now I was gonna say for every $5
donation I'll take a shot of this beer
which again is 12% so it's not super
light but I think that's just way too
that's too destructive because you guys
you guys are gonna end me if that's the
case so I don't know
I'll just if I just see like some if I
see lots of donations or like high
amount donations something that catches
my eye out of the ordinary then I'll
I'll take a shot of this beer out of
this amazing pirate shot glass that I
got at a Renaissance Faire a couple
years ago I kind of forgot I had this
and I told wifey sauce to just bring me
upstairs
bring me a shot glass from downstairs
and she went with this one
good choice honey oh all all uh I'll
start my own my own destruction right
now okay this is just you guys get a
freebie on this one but no more after
this
and that tastes like a 12% beer oh I
know it's okay it's okay because this is
I have no excuse I'm sorry ow ow I'm
really glad that didn't explode all over
the place cuz that's I'm prone to that
happening around me alright
okay are you ready are you ready I see
all of your friend requests I'm sorry I
can't add all of you I don't really play
video games that much these days anyway
don't really have time too busy making
videos for you guys so that's why I'm
actually pretty excited to be playing
tonight all right you ready honey you
should be
you really should be I said are you
running now you guys get to see what
wifey sauces wifey sauce and eyes
relationship is really like behind
closed doors I said are you ready we're
thrilled I'm never I'm never going into
matchmaking with you again that's a
promise
okay ready you're getting come how much
effort does it take to get comfortable
we're in we're at our home oh my god it
is so hot in here I am so uncomfortable
I've turned the AC on really quick and
you guys should really stick around for
the whole stream if you can because if
you're lucky you'll actually get to
watch one of my cats take a poo inside
of the fancy litter box back there that
I did do a video on several months ago
no it's it's it's cracked the the the
cats are smart enough to get in here if
they want to they're evil enough
dude what's up crafty man dude I miss
our h1z1 times together dude I really do
I know we're so bad like we haven't had
any time or we haven't made time to game
because you could always make time but
we haven't prioritized it and so long
we've just been words can't express how
incredibly slammed we are but it's nice
to see you in chat man I do miss I do
miss hanging out with you guys hope all
is well I'm rambling um Wow I'm trying
to entertain a stream right now okay
I currently currently have I don't even
know how many viewers are here right now
751 people okay if I as soon as I stop
talking they're gonna they're all gonna
just like flock you know what do your
headphones do you have YouTube up or
something or how is that possible
did you actually exit discord let me
check
mysteries mysteries what how am i
echoing hold on guys one sec
aha it was the in-game voice chat that
was the culprit
ah yes the only thing worse the only
thing that wifey sauce hates more than
hearing me once is hearing me twice okay
can we can we get the show on the road
sure sure
wifey sauces hi crafty you do you miss
it dearly
okay I'm pressing ready click ready up
red day OOP okay okay now guys don't
hate us we're very new to this game
we've played only a handful of times
before we know the basic mechanics and
stuff but we suck at building as a lot
of new players to this game often do so
please go easy on us it's it's right
there in the title that that that we
suck so um don't be surprised if if we
suck why Vsauce doesn't even know how to
play yo yo yo yo but it's okay because
we actually have two people in here we
have two people in our squad Brown goal
and spirit of gods vici who hopefully
are better at this game than we are can
you guys hear me I don't have oh I do
have voice chat on oh shit alright you
guys are you guys are I'm like like a
livestream right now there's about 800
people watching just so you know so you
don't say any incriminating bullshit I'm
sure you I'm sure you're all clearly
innocent nothing to hide no you guys let
us know when you're jumping out or let's
see where should we go

following you spirit of the gods lead me

I don't know if I'm equipped to handle
one of those barb or but I ain't giving
it up yeah boy face loss isn't h1z1 fan
she'll always be a die-hard oh hell oh
boy
boy cat just came into the room trying
to troll
he just wants attention all right
most of the loot is gone over where I am
anyway unless I missed it could have
very easily missed it it's all stuff up
there what up disturbed hey man how's it
going dude disturbed you'd have to
dominate $5.00 although I guess if you
wanted me to see your comment that's
probably the best way to do it
dude Mandy I was just uh we were just
saying how to crafty who popped in
saying that we missed the old days where
we actually made time to game and stuff
and got to show with you guys those were
good times the the awesome hardware
after parties so many fun late semi
drunken nights being bad at video games
had never been more fun well you know if
the guys are annoyed with me who I'm
playing with right now they can mute me
alright there are ways around that we
have the technology to shut up annoying
people like myself it's glorious
glorious world we live in people wait
what did you say did you ask if I'm on
float plane how do you know about float
plane are you one of them oh I'm sorry
what did you say I missed I
misunderstood you
let's get back I want this I want this
wait give me this give me the damn oh
yeah you can't
derp trend like swap my pickaxe for a
potion ridiculous oh my god forty rupees
that's like half a dollar thank you no I
honestly have no much I don't know how
much that is but thank you very much
pretty feet preciate a min I think we
are the only ones that dusty David yeah
I was expecting to be dead already so
I'm happy I got all the lutes I got more
ammo than I'll probably even use before
I die so I'm I'm smooth sailing right
now you know I'm just gonna I'm just
gonna like you know what for those forty
rupees those forty rupees Prithvi um I'm
pouring one poured one for the homie
Prithvi thank you very much sir
so good oh how do you drop oh so if you
want to swap weapons honey one way to do
it is to highlight the weapon you don't
want anymore by using your scroll wheel
you'll see in your the bottom right hand
corner all your weapons right I don't
think you can do that I think I think
the ammo goes with the gun that you drop
as far as I know I think some some gee
no oh you can press I and then just drag
and drop
whichever gun you don't want out of the
window or whatever all right I think we
should oh yeah we're in we're in the
safe zone we're looking good
all right let me come over to you this
is what somebody told me and I don't
know if they were misinformed or if
that's just how the game mechanics are
or just how that rule works guys in chat
can you drop a gun but keep its ammo is
there any way to do that or does is the
ammo tied with the gun ooh yeah it looks
like idiocracy is getting it no that's
fine that's fine he's probably better
with it than I am
what are all these thingies consume oh
cool I think that's cool
it doesn't look like oh they're saying
the ammo is separate
oh no wait someone's saying you always
keep ammo and other people are saying
the ammo in the in the gun is stuck in
the gun and then someone says yes you
keep the ammo we're having very
conflicting answers here
Oh ammo and mag is tied to the gun yeah
I was right honey
so yeah wha I'm trying to think here I
should probably not have my pickaxe out
when running around okay you do what
direction what Oh God
oh god I'm down I'm down he's gonna get
me Oh Shh yeah killed by a woman that
probably wasn't a woman in real life
though that's okay
oh I'm spectating you honey
should have pulled out the shot II
should have gone for the damn shot eo8
crawl crawl to safety when you're down
you can still move around you just can't
like shoot yeah you can crawl to safety
in hopes that your teammate can can
revive you
I used a jump crystal that sounds fun
hump the crystal I didn't know I could
hump crystals how come no one told me
this all right let's get out leave batch
oh you're just you're just quick just
faster than me okay um
you know I really wish that they could
hear you I think it'd be more fun for
them so you guys he would have to deal
with every day every day oh yeah yeah
that well your voice is literal or
littler than I initially anticipated so
what we could do is get you back on
discord oh boy oh boy oh boy
boom boom boom oh cool that'll pass
cheer up I've reached here - that sounds
high yeah so I'm gonna go into your room
in Generale row Thank You bad gamer 47
for the $5 donation might want to turn
on push-to-talk also an FPS counter
would be nice for the audience ooh not a
bad idea
do I even have fraps on this freshly
freshly put together system no I cannot
because I muted you let me unmute you
now say stuff cool okay
no I don't hear an echo but they're
probably going to start hearing an echo
at some point
so here what let's see go to voice in
video okay so go to your settings the
little gear at the very bottom yeah
voice and or voice in video and then
click push-to-talk
when this relative has focus okay don't
know they're just not okay you should so
what you could do is press the shortcut
no key bind wait push a talk women will
only work when the browser tab has
focused download oh it's probably not
working because I have the browser
version right now aigoo
eko like oh go go okay um click on the
shortcut whatever what does it say click
the the scroll wheel after you click it
no so click it and then scroll wheel
click yeah stop recording there so now
whenever you want to talk to me and you
want the audience to hear you you just
hold down the scroll wheel try it wow
that's accurate but mean yeah yeah if I
can hear you through my headphones then
they can hear you because I'm recording
all the desktop audio as well mmm
cool cool cool cool cool cool and then
yeah my mind's push-to-talk so blahdy
blahdy blah I think we're good I think
we're in good shape
ok doo dee doo dee doo we would play
with Kris people in chat but I believe
he's on xbox and I think there is a way
to cross play but we haven't really
figured that out yet and would probably
take too long to do it right now yes
yeah when you give us money and you
already work for us then you're fired
according to wifey sauce ok ready ready
Oh f PS counter of course we'll uh oh I
don't know if you'd be able to see fraps
though eh
do I have afterburner I do have
afterburner is rivas Statistics tuner
installed as well let's find out ooh
hello oh oh hi hello get greedy oh wow

moment so that's why I'm talking to who

hello shotgun ooh a purple thing I like
the purple ones those are those are good
at the moment let me check my talent I'm

thousand if I was lying

lean livestreaming
that's a terrible idea um let's see here
okay but but but why but why show on
screen display man afterburner is so
finicky let me tell you it says show it
in OSD everything looks there but for
some reason for some reason Pham it is
not wanting to pop up I'm gonna try
restarting the game okay and then maybe
just maybe shit will work attempts if
you want you went boom boom
I'm doing this for you guys I'm doing it
doing it for you all right just shut up
let's see what else would you want to
see
all right let's go with that let's go
with that
all right all right honey I will in the
game settings are there other in is
there an in-game frame counter chef yes
okay cool and then that'll show up right
she has to show up as well
perfect perfect oh all right cool
what a great piece of advice for someone
who knows nothing about this game um
excellent so there's the frame rate it's
very tiny guys but it's what I've got to
work with at the moment you could take
that clip out of context however you
like but you know what it's time for
another shot of beer a beer if this was
if this was actual liquor oh oh
I would I would not be feeling good for
uh some hardware tomorrow mm hmm hmm all
right so uh oh and now it decides to
work there's After Burner
when you need it that's even better
though Wow 120 FPS guys in the menu all
right you ready honey all right you're
lame Greggy D you are out cuz I'm gonna
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna perma ban
you right now no I'm just kidding I
wouldn't do that I'm too chicken but

streaming right now so sorry you can
mute me just go ahead and meet me I
won't get offended but you you anything

Oh then I would not want to have you as
a teammate if you're blind that doesn't
sound very conducive to kami that's okay
I'm I can see and I'm I'm probably worse
than a blind person at this game last
time I got a hand cannon that must have
been oh sorry already Oh No who's the
son of a bitch who killed yeah I'll get
him for ya oh god damn it he's too good
he he had there was like five of them I
was surrounded honey there was nothing I
could do
yeah there was at least like six or
seven guys they were just they all came
out of nowhere good luck man have a good
one
yeah that was total bullshit but he
doesn't know that unless he watches the
stream leader okay everyone so good it's
a combination honey of them being really
good and us being really bad so you
can't give them all the credit ready
thank you very much fresh tacos for
saying that you love the channel I
appreciate it
hey T Ali two dollars I think you're
actually better than ninja you know what
I was I was trying to not say that on
stream because I just feel like it's
kind of cocky of me but you know I'm
glad you pointed that up first so
flattered bazinga x10 Dora Heather and I
will donate weight Heather I will donate
$100 if you smack him hard on the back
of the head for saying you are not

slapped I will drink to that
I usually deserve all of my slaps all of
my slaps are usually earned none of that

oh but they just jumped out I'm going
with him how let's go
who knows step you know I don't know do
they match make you with other shitty
people or people that are on the same at
the same skill level because I feel like
we haven't got paired with ninja yet I'm
just waiting to get paired with ninja
and like feel super badass but that
hasn't happened yet
I'm wondering if there's a bit of a bit
of profiling some skill based profiling
going on about that you know feel like
that's racist it's cuz I'm Asian

halftime show turn the street can we

you're wearing you look like a dude you
need to shave that beard that moustache
that mustachio needs to go oh yeah it's
pretty it's pretty shitty we need to
move oh and we're not in the safe zone
anymore so yeah it is still fairly
equally when you talk honey talk really
quietly and say can you hear an echo now
I know but like actually whisper so it
doesn't come up on my mic at all do it
did you guys hear an echo on her saying
her whispering I hate you oh did the boy
just take a shit I think the boy the
girl just took a shit oh and I might
have been blocking it I'm sorry guys I
totally blocked your great a view oh oh
damn all that hype for nothing you did
not even get to see my cat use its
butthole okay can we just just can we
just for one second appreciate that I'm
getting a hundred and thirty plus FPS
right now and our GPU is sitting pretty
at 76 C with 46 46 C on the the CPU
which is not even overclocked I haven't
even touched that can anyone guess what
CPU I'm gaming on right now that could
possibly only be only 20% or less taxed
at 3700 megahertz
does anyone have an idea of what CPU I
might be running at the moment and GPU
for that matter let's take some guesses
people Oh
oh honey honey honey Oh God oh geez what
how are they so good they're so good
oh my god oh my god come on fortnight
fuse oh he's down to B 3 s B 3 s 1 it's
up to you Edward God why don't we get
paired with good people wait oh I see a
semi correct answer here it's an
incomplete answer but semi correct for
the CPU guessing and if I tell you what
the main platform is it's kind of a
giveaway because there aren't many SKUs
within this within this particular
family
yes a lot of you guys are catching on
it is thread Ripper it's a thread Ripper
machine with a 1950 ex well played
ladies and gentlemen and I do see I
thought I saw gtx 980 yep it's a gtx 980
for the win - it's actually the GPU that
I initially put in my grandpa's system
and then very quickly realized or
actually knew beforehand that he would
never ever saturate the full potential
of that card so I popped it popped it
into this new thread Ripper system which
is actually March marches PC of the
month I believe this was this is March
as PC of the month that I'm gaming on
right now but obviously I swapped out
the Vegas 64 for the GTX 1080 mainly
because the Vegas 64 was causing serious
crashing in fortnight which I could not
figure out for the longest time I didn't
realize that it was the GP I checked
memory and CPU I you know you always go
to the memory or the the CPU or the BIOS
you know whatever go through all the
troubleshooting steps clearing CMOS and
stuff and it wasn't the only thing that
fixed it was swapping out the graphics
card and you know updating the drivers
so bizarre I don't know and I haven't
really done any more research into it to
see if fortnight has any incompatibility
bugs with with AMD drivers I don't know
I don't know but the 1080 just works it
is friggin words and goodbye person in
chat to said goodbye and let's see oh
wait the naked podcast $5 add me fart
nut fart nut is your name as compelling
as that is fart nut I'm probably not
gonna add anyone just because if I add
one person then everyone's like why
Jabby it opens the floodgates PC specs
since everyone's asking yep no no 1950 X
GT x 1080 we got 32 gigs of RAM
I can tell you right now yep
we have um wait for D wait 48 oh yeah we
have crap yeah we've 32 gigs of RAM and
a motherboard is that oh yeah it's the
x3 99m from asrock the board is sick its
micro ATX actually gaming on a micro ATX
system fun fun David Jensen 1499 dollar

been attracted to it you're loud
scratchy voice but is it but is her loud
scratchy voice echoing anymore no echo
holy crap
Jason thank you very much you know
sometimes I I can't think when I'm doing
one thing or another and multitasking is
very hard for me I'm my brain is more or
less a single-core CPU where it does one
thing very well but as soon as it tries
to juggle it just kind of gets destroyed
so thank you very much for pointing that
out to me you've saved us all a lot of
heartache and here ache our precious
ears can now rest and I drink to you oh
oh oh there it is there it is okay so
every time so it's an automated it's an
automated pooper an automated cat cat
box and now it's it's self-cleaning so
because you know Heather and I were lazy
cat owners mainly me and the boy the boy
cat right there he's he still to this
day just so fascinated by this
self-cleaning litter box any time it
goes into its automated cycle he just
kind of sits there and watches his poop
flush like it would be like if every
time I flushed my shit I just like just
had to watch it go down every single
time which I do but he's he he's the one
with issues not me right yeah he would
try to he would try to like swipe it
swipe his shit he wouldn't try yeah shit
wouldn't get on the carpet cuz he was
trying to like Bob for apples but it was
like the apples were his shit pieces and
then we would have to Bob for shit on
the carpet like pick that shit up
so it's a very it's a very sophisticated
device are you guys are you guys
enjoying this are you all just hating
life right now because the stream so
awful

echo we won't be able to get rid of no

that what it is nice with your with your
cryptic 1 worded message a touch - it's
right on the money I don't I don't know

Monday night if I do say so myself
I'm done better of course Oh Christian
Robinson thank you very much for the two
Canadians we appreciate that man man
okay should probably shut up guys in
chat would you be pissed if I did a
purely gaming stream once a month
because it's probably the first actual
gaming stream that I've done just from
the walls in in quite a while
at least here on YouTube which shit I
just took out a whole team no way what
what what what well I'm probably dead
here no don't say that's no I want you
to live you sound better than us I want
to use you and all of your infinite
skill well I'm just trying okay Cutlass

at least I'll oh I don't know I don't
know what I'm gonna do honestly oh
you're like way on the other side of the
frickin mountain Jesus
anyways I'm gonna stream around Florida
how do you think I should get bigger oh
I don't know it's really it's really
just time and pressure you know time and
pressure gets you anywhere you just have
to keep doing and you got to do it
because you enjoy doing it not because
you want the money or the fame but
because you actually love the shit
that's the number one okay
I started streaming it I reached her max
of 50 viewers on one stream when I was
playing around the mad guard like I got
a Philly and I got a fuckin week or
something like that everything that's a
pretty good get a FIRREA taffy really
holy shit you are good you at you on
fire you you're on fire like the little
kind not like the Rihanna boat question
question question are you good at this
game okay
oh god no oh god is the entertaining
factor I mean I hardly entertaining I
mean I I don't know why people are
watching to be honest I think it's just
Monday night and they don't have
anything better to do
sorry chat I love you um but no I think
it's you know you just okay it's mainly
a tech channel not first and foremost a
gaming channel but it's a tech channel
so a kiss so I spend more time testing
games than I play them but every now and
then I'm like you know what fuck it I'm
done testing this piece-of-shit game I
actually want to kill people and then
once in a while I'll do a stream like
this and people tune in because they I
don't know enjoy watching me in general
regardless of what I'm doing and so I
can't there's there's much better people
to ask on how to grow a streaming
audience because that's not my forte but
I will say like anything in life you
probably just got to do a shit ton of it
all the time and be willing to make
sacrifices my name is Kyle I figured I'm
trolling um it's a bit wit bi T WI T

wife sauce for a bit why thank you very
much Anthony Ray's odd for the $4.99 you
know you could have you could have just
made it an even 5 bro you have to skimp
out on me one cent that's kind of its
kind of cheap don't you think I mean
that's cool whatever just saying
following you Paul and my Vsauce and
more great content what's your favorite
item in your store
that's a great question actually I think
you're the first person to ever ask me
that the my favorite item in the store
in my merch store that way tech slash
store just saying um man I really really
have been liking the desk mats that that
John our merch guy found for us they
have stitched edges they are super clean
I mean they're just as high-quality as
this the this ROG one that I'm using
right now like you like it's they're
really really nice I might even have the
extended ultra wide one so that it can
house your keyboard and stuff like that
too I really am proud of those pieces
and obviously the shirts are great too
but any of the Tri blends are just so
comfortable comfortable and the rip game
pad design is the freshest item of the
bunch which I also rather like it's just
fun it's just fun all right
all right I'm coming I'm going out to
rip wifey rip our team rip our little
team okay hmm okay so did we decide what
we wanted to play next if anything I say

both so we're both so terrible at this
game that I feel like it's a disservice
to you guys even though as the title
says I'm still having fun okay let's
let's see
I do have or here's here's a good way to
narrow it down honey what games do you
currently have installed on your system

most handsome person you ever see one

your system it's been so long

fruta chu rocket leg although we don't

maybe not ten years but many years okay
what what what what gives you yet
honey it's making email I don't know
what No
Stevens open you should be able to just
look at your library click library okay
there your games you can't see all of
them they're hidden what do you mean it
looks like they're all they're all the
ones that are grayed out are ones that
aren't installed on your computer that's
it do I have cope with the friends do I
even have that game that might have been
one of the games that you played with
like with everyone else but me you know
the the period of time the period of
time in my life where you stole all of
my internet friends and you just played
game I know they were smart and they
figured it out I was hoping they'd be
dumb but they weren't okay okay what how
is golf with friends for gigs that
should be like a 65 megabyte game okay
let's do it honey let's play golf with
friends sounds fun but since then yeah
yeah all right oh my god go away hit man

why steam makes it definitely what me
making a mistake all right I'll have
down a little energy I'll have

can start playing that game and you know
I'm sure
all dying to see what kind of frame

DLC we need to get you know like like
new new golf courses or yeah we're good

more reasonable resolution graphics

full-screen res oh here we go

shoulder so how long is your update
going to take for this
um if you click on downloading or the
the bottom the very bottom says
downloading or downloads or something
yeah it will tell you it'll tell you all
the things I'm good by fortnight it's
been fun
thank you for pointing out how bad I am
at games now Mesta okay I like it it's a
very simple game no we're not weren't I
gonna ride a bike
friggin cuphead I didn't have that game
but I've heard it's a really good game
it's maybe I'll play in the future oh no
man this is fun I I enjoy playing games
when I make the time to play them so I
just I just don't know I feel is it
weird to feel self-conscious about
playing games in front of people because
I'm not good at them anymore because I
don't devote any time to them and I feel
like streamers these days are so good at
games that that's part of the reason why
they have these loyal followings people
respect them and appreciate them and I
just feel like so inadequate you know I
feel like handicapped so I feel like
maybe if I had more confidence in my
gaming abilities I might stream more for
you guys but it's been sort of an
obstacle for me perhaps
I don't know know then again you know
you've got streamers who are you know
not not super great at games but are
just more entertaining and I guess maybe
that's where I lie maybe that's my my
schtick or at least I can you can you
know I don't know be moderately
entertaining I don't know
are you still updating what are you
doing to that poor gummy bear back there
and what what is it why what is it is it
a lamp it's a lamp right okay
so it's a semi translucent gummy bear oh
my god coalition it's so funny that you
mentioned stack attack live I was
literally just talking about doing a
live stack attack I think that would be
awesome because I don't know if you guys
can tell but most of most of the
gameplay element of stack attack is it's
not edited that much you know a full
round will take us anywhere from 15
probably 10 to 15 minutes and you know
when we actually cut it all up
we don't really trim all that much we
trimmed some of the the downtime of us
like you know respawning and trying to
find each other where there's no action
happening but for the most part you're
seeing like a real-time a real-time
battle so I think it would translate
pretty well I think that show would
would translate pretty well to a live
stream so maybe one of these days we'll
we'll do like a special LIVE edition I
think that'd be a lot of fun oh you're
in oh hey there okay how do i how do i
ahead oh we are friends honey you're my
best friend you're my bestie invite no I
can't fight you back offline online host
room name
OOP private no not private players let's
do eight no let's do five we need to
actually create room I just created a
room called poop okay can you can you
can you click on line and then click
join and then find a way to join find
poop room hurry before other before the
viewers find it and then you will have
no room in poop land you didn't you
couldn't find it good lord invite
friends how about I just invite you
there accepted look it like I see your
ball honey I thought I was the only one
with the ball in the relationship I will
go ahead and reconfigure my screen so
that you guys can see what I'm doing
don't worry you don't worry you haven't
missed much all of you people looking at
a black screen we haven't even started
started gaming or anything but that
should do it
hey well hey now hey now you're a rock
star get the show on get raided sweet
and never playing golf with friends go
with your friends ha ha ha alright
alright ready ready honey I don't think
Owens joining us if you couldn't find
the server or the room then they
probably can't either all right so I'm
kind of
oh no I don't I've just realized in that
moment that they don't really oh okay so
you hold the left-click down and then
you move your mouse up or down depending
on how much power you want - oh poor
baby
poor baby you get it you suck you oh so
much all right
oh my goodness oh my goodness okay I say
we play this last right now and then we
call it because I got to be somewhat
well-rested for awesome Hardware
tomorrow it's gonna be drinking even
more and Raijin throughout the night
okay okay I'm going geez don't rush
perfection please oh so did I so did I I
got a hole in one and your shit is done
take a look at me I'm on the run this is
just for fun oh my goodness
yep that was intentional don't worry
I've done it all before oh my god no no
you are just rooting for my failure
raging for my demise what's a brilliant
way if I have and we're getting to the
bottom of the barrel here with our
triple IPA hmm oh this one has a paddle
Kinki oh did you get a hole in one here
no good
good ooh we're we are tied Wow this is
close is there a way that we can look at
the rest of the course or no probably
not
boom oh I see you oh that's pretty close
pretty close pretty close hey I'm
beating you by one point just thought
I'd point that out oh my gosh I didn't
already yeah I didn't I don't think
either of us were expecting it to be a
gap no I
how'd you knew how'd you know how'd you
knew wait but seriously how'd you knew
though how did you knew scroll out
oh my god he was infuriating I haven't
been this pissed oh my god I somehow got
a hole in like not a hole in one but in
that one shot from I I made it in from
spawn how are we getting a high how am I
getting a higher frame rate in fortnight
then I am engulfed with France golf with
friends is more taxing than fortnight
maybe it's because it's like see all CPU
base I don't know I have no idea how
this game operates that's really funny
though alrighty
oh this is a little come on come on come
on
I got a boogie I got a boogie
next time we'll next time we'll
definitely stream some minesweeper for
you guys oh wait wait what the heck is
supposed to happen here oh my god I
totally screwed up damn it oh come on
well how the hell am I supposed to get
out of here how do we get out of here
no I'm incapable of thinking on my own
and it looks like you are too apparently
wait so do we just have to like suck it
up and lose here
oh okay I guess we can sort of go what
bullshit you are not better at this game
than I am I refuse to believe that God
well you know what it took me Ted and
we're tied we're so tight Oh what no way
how how do we do this I got this bro I'm
a good sportsman though good good
sportsmanship hey that's good honey oh

damn we are really close here for
tonight is looking really weird right
now I'm sure it does guys trust me this
is just this is just our our wine down
game this is our wine down game before
we end the night okay you always gotta
have a wine down game you've got your
stream and then you have like a semi in
the indie indie wine down game did I
bump into you yes Wow you know if this
was real life that would be sexual
harassment but now but here it's just
fun
it's just fun dicking around you know
here we go oh wait what no I didn't mean
to do that
editor jump off oh no no I didn't you're
bouncing off what I mean balancing how
do you balance you can click to bounce
well good because balls can't actually
bounce on their own in real life so
that's unrealistic and let's like this
games already super realistic right
that's why we have balls that have minds
of their own 100 FPS Wow you you have a
very you underestimate your strengths
honey I think you're stronger than you
think
Oh your balls cute honey
you have a cute ball all right okay wow
what what I mean how do you have 48 now

on I got a birdie I'm gonna get a birdie
too
yeah what what what how did you get 12
on the last one

fortnight's stream and people are

tonight anymore so you guys did that
he's all your fault which is why we
can't have nice things

video oh my god sorry no this was a
blast I really enjoyed this and we
should do this more often right honey

and I just for cheated you all this
stuff I yeah she gets pretty annoyed
with me when when I game and I'm
streaming and I've had a few drinks and
well I mean even even just in regular
when none of that applies she still but
see that's that's true love is when I'm
like annoying a shit but you still love
me that's unconditional love
there's no criteria of what I need to do
in order for you to love me which okay
that's probably one of the criteria but
they're not like they're not like
designer or anything right
