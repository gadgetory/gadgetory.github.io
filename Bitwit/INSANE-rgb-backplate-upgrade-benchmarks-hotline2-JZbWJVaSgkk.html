Hot Diggity damn I'm excited we're gonna
talk about overclocking thermals
performance ICO specs and probably
something else that I just forgot we
actually get to see hot line two in
action for the very first time I can't
wait to show you guys the results and
this is gonna be good
but first look at this look at these
custom GPU back plates that the folks
over at v1 tech made for me look at them
they're beautiful they use like a dye
sublimation process I don't know it's
totally over my head but look at how
nice it looks addressable RGB strip on
the back you get your choice of mounting
it with little magnets or adhesive and a
couple different options for connecting
all this stuff is included with what
they sent me and I'm sure it's included
for any of their other customers so you
can wire this straight to your
motherboard with a 5 volt 3 pin cable
they've also included the cable for
Corsair IQ use you can control this with
the IQ software assuming you've got like
a lighting node pro or a commander Pro
inside of your system which hotline has
both and finally you could connect it
straight to your power supply via SATA
with a little on the controller here
controller and receiver but the included
remote handy awesome stuff so stay tuned
to the end of the video where I install
these guys actually I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to install both I think I
can probably get away with installing
the top one or one on the top GPU
without having to you know drain the
system and pull things out that would
obviously be the preferred method but
that would take too long for this video
so I'm gonna try to at least get one of
them on the top GPU so stick around for
that should be exciting also check out
v1 Tech I'll put a link in the
description they make a lot more than
custom GPU back plates this video is
brought to you by mod mic modular mic
you can fix to any set of headphones for
the best of both worlds high-quality
voice audio superb noise cancelling and
the option for wired or Wireless models
are just a few reasons I've been using
their products for years mod mic is a
great no compromise solution for gamers
who care about sound click on the link
below to learn more all right let's talk
about let's talk about the performance
here starting with overclocking now if
we look over here you're running at 5
gigahertz on all 8 cores and that's at
one point two nine five volts didn't
even have to cross the one point three
volt mark now I did actually overclock
the 9900 K to five point one gigahertz
at one point just because why the hell
not and that took about one point three
three five volts to get it stable
but it was just a little too hot for my
liking the spiking up to 90 see most of
the time it was in the high 80s but
still just a little too warm for my
liking so I brought it back down to 5
gigahertz
as for the GPUs oh wait no no no hold on
I haven't even oh gosh I haven't even
opened up afterburner so the overclock
settings haven't been applied yet let's
just do some on-the-fly overclocking
gosh yeah so I maxed out the power and
temp sliders but a bing bada boom our
core clock offset was given a 115
megahertz pool and a memory clock was
like 9 I think I'm gonna ply that
please don't crash become pretty cool
groove yeah this is these are the
settings these are the overclocked
settings that it's been running at for
all the benchmarks and I stress tested
it for about an hour and a half and
everything's hunky-dory everything's
great look at these GPU tips okay this
is the the table GPU I believe 50 C 50 C
and that's it over two gigahertz Oh
second card also over two gigahertz 51 C
now I don't think the GPUs are
completely heat soaked at this point
because over the course of about 6 7
hours is about how long I've been
testing a hot line today the hottest the
GPUs got was 64 C on both carbs at over
2 gigahertz I'm I'm over the moon as for
the CPU temps were hovering in the 7 B
for the max of 75 of course that might
go up a little bit put in my testing
today didn't really get much hotter than
78 79 so below the 80 mark 5 gigahertz
on a cores on a 99 hundred K custom
water-cooled
I'm a happy camper I'm gonna try to not
bore you with many more details and then
you guys are very anxious to see the
results so the benchmarks I ran ran
seven games all right seven triple-a
titles at 2560 by 1440 as well as 3840
by 2160 commonly referred to as 4k using
the latest wiggled driver from Nvidia at
the time of filming also you might
notice a little of homage to the
original hot line this is the original
core i7 59 60 X that where there was an
OG OD hot line in case you forgot this
is an 8 core 16 thread chip back in the
day when most gamers only had 4 cores oh
my how times have changed on the last
thing I'll say is that in a couple of
the games maybe one or two titles you'll
notice that the frame rates the average
frame rates between both resolutions are
very
similar that's indicative of the CPU
bottleneck not even our 9900 K
overclocked and water-cooled can keep up
all the time with our 220 ATT is in SLI
alright I'll shut up now so guys here it
is the performance numbers from a brand
new gaming rig
Wow hotline 2 is pretty fast huh boy yes
she is she's very quick I think we were
getting on average across seven games
165 FPS at 1440p so definitely passing
the 144 Hertz threshold which is pretty
awesome and I think it 4k the average
was 125 something like that hundred 25
FPS one thing I forgot to mention before
I ran the benchmarks or before I showed
you guys the benchmarks was acoustics
we're on the quiet profile within
Corsairs IQ software that's with all six
fans you know it does ramp up a little
bit becomes definitely audible it's even
audible right now honestly although it's
bad test because we have one of the side
panels off but still nothing that's
gonna annoy the average person certainly
not me I think I think he's purring more
loudly than the computer right now stop
doing that my mic right here people are
gonna hear you oh we still have to
install the backplate let's install the
backplate that's from the first hot line
it's a tribute whoo power supply huh not
a bad idea
would be cool is if we actually made it
like a little custom sign here that said
rest in peace hot line you know like a
little memoriam textarea yeah something
like that
anyway we're getting off test let's
let's let's install this GPU backplate
so I'm gonna just start with the top GPU
first this entry points not gonna fly we
got the pump res in the way and then if
we go up top here also in the way wifey
sauce actually came up with the idea of
removing the rear expansion slot great
great idea honey and shoving it into the
rear if it fits it looks like it does
the other thing is well clear this tube
this tube is very very close to the
existing GPU backplate you know what
actually before we do that I'm gonna
turn the system off alright systems off
let's try this again oh you know I'm
actually gonna put some adhesive on
first
there we go okay it's really hard to
push it through because the adhesive
gets stuck on hope the back plate oh
that's like giving birth definitely
suggest installing these outside of the
case if you can help it that actually
looks pretty dead-on it's good fitment
it like fits right over the existing ek
back plate so that's good
now off-camera I actually already wired
up the receiver here you can see our
receiver / controller it's directly
connected to our power supply plug Dion
maybe we should go for the second one
thank you just gonna do the little ones
this time I think the little ones will
be enough and we've got our adhesive on
the back plate so that's easy does it we
got it
we're good we can't boot it's gonna be
all RGB it's gonna be all rainbow at
first before I cue kicks in look at that
holy okay that that kind of just takes
the build over the edge doesn't it hot
damn v1 Tech everyone very nice
very very nice look at those effects
let's see this is controller control
both back plates at the same time or do
we have to use two of them
oh it controls both that's freaking
awesome mmm that's cool
that's that's a contender it's very
retro for some reason all these are
pretty cool how does one decide between
so many cool effects
all right y'all it's pretty much gonna
sum it up here I think this this build
speaks for itself
I I did a great job and I'm the best why
are you laughing oh come on really
ruining the shot
very classy girl anyway if you guys
liked the video toss a like on it
my Vizslas can't even hold the camera
still anymore be sure to subscribe to
the channel for more tech stuff coming
at you really soon I'm gonna murder you
and I will see you guys in the
give me the damn camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
