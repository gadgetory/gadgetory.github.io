kicked off a little web reality series
called system-config
the objective to find a person in
desperate need of a new PC and build
them the best possible rig within their
price range the show turned out to be a
hit with its first few episodes but also
proved to be a lot of work so I decided
a while back that I would only shoot new
episodes when the opportunity presented
itself naturally while my friends after
finding a man on a quest for smoother
workflows higher frame rates and a
reason to ditch his old aging laptop it
was time for me to dust off the old
camera that I haven't used since
yesterday ladies and gentlemen without
further adieu this is episode 5 of
system-config
enjoy everyone my name is Jason I'm from
Los Angeles California I'm looking to
build a mid-range PC that I can use to
play games and also video edit with this
PC I'm looking to run Adobe Premiere for
editing and I want to play
counter-strike
overwatch evolve and battlefield 1
currently I'm using a MacBook Pro that I
bought in 2010 for college and now it's
starting to get a little slow and it's
workable
but it's a pain my budget for this rig
is about $1,200 look at the game at 1080
so nothing crazy hoping to get a couple
good years out of this rig before having
it upgrade over all I'm hoping with this
PC that I'll be able to increase my
editing productivity and get back to
gaming
alright let's crack this thing open so
this is your old MacBook Pro mid 2010
13-inch and it looks like you kept it up
in pretty good shape actually there's
like just a few minor scuffs you know
basic wear and tear however I did notice
this power cable here this is this is
just an amazing hack job of duct taping
and other things what went on here well
the the cable started to thrill at the
end to prevent any further damage I
decided to take preventive measures nice
seems like you've done a bang-up job um
no no sparks flying out yet not yet ok
cool well then it looks like we were
building you a new system just in time
before it explodes cool so let's let's
talk about the specs really quickly on
this thing we're going to go to to
detail here but
we've got a two point six six gigahertz
intel core2duo so I'm going to do a core
processor which again back in the day
would have been pretty killer but now
we're starting to see a lot more
programs like premier or like Final Cut
take advantage of more cores as well as
games so you know India quad core is in
your immediate future I can say too much
right now and finally you've got some
graphics in here from GeForce from
Nvidia I should say geforce 320 m so a
mobile processor several generations
back several several going back to the
the old ancient times and 256 megabytes
of mirin yeah holy smokes
you did say you have csgo installed on
this computer and you have Final Cut 7
as well okay so let's let's possibly do
some testing here because I'm really
curious to see just how this thing
performs obviously you've kind of told
us that it's really sluggish but I want
to see for myself damn it I want to see
so when we go ahead and fire up let's
let's do it let's do final cut first all
right cool all right so we just imported
a five-minute clip in here
it's a 4k file and it's just a simple
clip of me building a computer and what
have you we just drop it into the
timeline let's go ahead and play back
and see exactly have smooth or lack
thereof here eat this okay
Wow so it just completely sucks we're
dropping frames like like they're hot
right obviously everything is just being
bogged down right now and grand 4k is a
pretty crushing test and it probably is
a bit unfair to test it on a
six-year-old MacBook Pro however I
didn't want to use this file and show
this example because it's also what
we're going to be using when we test
your new PC just to get real apples to
apples comparison to show really how far
we've come from this old system all
right so we are just in the heat of
battle here in cs:go and it took us
probably about two or three minutes just
to show you the map writing that I was
estimating roughly but it took quite a
while on that mechanical Drive but we're
in the game now Jason is actually you're
actually doing fairly well for the low
FPS that we're getting right now which
is hovering at 26 30fps frequent dips
into the 20s I saw like an 18 in there
the only time you get anything over 35
FPS is when you die and there's just
like a screen like an image but it's
super choppy I mean I'm sure at some
point if you played enough of it you
might get used to it but it's really not
ideal right this is just bad anything
under 30 FPS I mean 30 FPS is like the
bare minimum that you should be dipping
into these days for some smooth playback
right so we're definitely tapping into
that 24 frames per second now just
that's this has been very insightful and
I think we're gonna see some mad
Gainsborough on your new system which I
think I want to talk about right now and
we should probably look at the parts for
that and then build it but we're doing
something a little bit different on
system config this time I'm not actually
going to let you see any of the parts
well you already know what the parts are
but Michael let you see the finish build
until it's completely done okay so um so
yeah you're gonna have to have to
skedaddle and then we're going to build
this thing cool it all right get the
hell out of here waiting for get out
alright so as Jason mentioned apart from
gaming he'll also be editing frequently
on this new system so I felt it was only
right to hook him up with a chip that
supports hyper threading and since we
don't quite have the budget for x99 the
core i7 6700 K seemed like an ideal
choice overclocking should also shave
some time off of those video
unders while speeding up his overall
workflow helping those overclocked stay
cool is the cryo rig h7 techpowerup gave
this tower cooler an Editors Choice
Award and called it the new mainstream
cooler to beat for memory we have the 2
by 8 gig kit of Corsair Vengeance lpx
ddr4 and 2133 that we'll be using to
populate the MSI z170a crate gaming 3x
motherboard this board goes easy on your
wallet without skimping on too many
features like m2 PCIe gen3 by for you to
SLI and crossfire and USB 3.1 now
choosing a video card for this build was
interesting because when I was compiling
a parts list back in June there were
several new GPU offerings in our midst
some of which like the GTX 1060 hadn't
even been publicly announced yet so
going off of what myself and the rest of
the world knew at the time I went with
the rx 488 gigabyte reference model
branded by MSI now from my own personal
testing and weeks prior I'm very
confident in the cards 1080 gaming and
VR abilities however I've told Jason to
keep an eye out for reviews on the
similarly priced gtx 1060 once they're
available so he can decide ultimately
which card wields the better value for
his needs for our media files we have a
WD black 2 terabyte hard drive and for
our boot drive we have a 250 gig samsung
850 Evo which is still one of the best
bang for the buck options in NAND land
juicing the system is the EVGA supernova
750 watt power supply the unit features
what I thought were all black cables
based on the product pictures but alas
we find ourselves in ketchup and mustard
Ville on the upside we get a quiet ball
bearing fan and a semi modular design
with an 80 plus bronze certification
backed by a five-year warranty
last but not least all of this beautiful
hardware will end up inside of the
Eclipse Series p400s from fantex
the S model includes internal sound
dampening material and modular vent
covers on top to prioritize silence or
airflow for an $80 case fantex has
raised the bar for value cases with
steel construction a side panel window
and a healthy amount of radiator support
with room for a 360 at the front and 120
at the back and just because they're
nice guys fantex also offered to send
Jason some other black power supply
extensions and magnetic RGB LED strips
which can be controlled via the cases
front panel switch lucky guy and with
that the total cost of our build comes
out to just north of Jason's budget
leaving
us with a capable little gaming PC that
should easily put his old MacBook Pro to
shame I suppose there's only one way to
verify that though
all right so the moment has come your PC
build went very smoothly I will say the
case we were building in was incredibly
easy to kind of get all the parts in
there cable management this was right on
par as well but the time has come for me
to actually show this to you for the
first time and this is not a joke guys
Jason has never seen this PC before all
built he knows that the parts he knows
all the pieces going into it
but strictly kept him up when it's to
this this part of the video until now so
you ready for it yeah Jason here is your
new PC so as you can see it's got a
fairly big window sir I know you were
mentioning that you wanted to kind of be
able to see some of the bling that we
get out in there so definitely it's also
illuminated by some LEDs pantex did
throw in some LED stirs for us or for
you and it's actually connected to the
case that oh I'm sorry so there's an
actual LED button on the chassis that's
built in and you can cycle between
different colors also I just want to
tell you that there's a fan controller
so if you let's say you're in the heat
of battle maybe your systems getting a
little warm you can crank up the fan
speed you can kind of just tell based on
the acoustics and you can put your hand
here and feel you know more or less
airflow going through the case you've
also got a couple options here so you
have these panels that are magnetic they
pop right off obviously they've got if
you want to tailor the system for
silence you can leave them on because
they've got some sound dampening
material underneath however if you want
to open it up just for a bit more
airflow of cooling you can take them off
and the case also does come with some
dust filters that are that you can slap
on here so it doesn't accumulate dust
but what do you think so far this is my
PC this is your PC yeah it's definitely
and do you like the way it looks
hopefully I did I didn't I didn't
screwing up too badly this is like for
me like probably the greatest thing also
that's happened awesome and
I hope that I really hope that it serves
you well for several years several years
to come and I think you're going to
enjoy even more once you start getting
on it and editing with it I wanted to
ask you do you know where you're going
to put this yet like are you are you
going to put this on before like you're
not planning on putting this on the
floor are you by the desk so I'm
thinking that's a full possession okay
then I don't have to kill you I can put
this away so I think right now what we
should do is hook it up maybe to a
monitor and some other peripherals and
test it out kind of run through some of
the same games or testing that we did
with with your MacBook Pros see how we
care about it sounds good alright let's
do it all right so now we've made our
way into Adobe Premiere Pro it's a cs6
and unfortunately we can't do a straight
apples to apples comparison with Final
Cut because it's not supported on
Windows which is of course we're running
Windows 10 64 bit here on your new
system but we're going to use the same
4k five-minute clip and we're just going
to play back in the timeline see exactly
what we can get away with here in terms
of quality settings we can actually
adjust the quality settings of our
playback preview monitor here so if you
right click that and go down to playback
resolution let's just do full let's just
do full this is on playing games here
all right so just go ahead and its face
when you're ready we can see here that
we're actually getting some really
smooth playback this is a full quality
playback looks pretty smooth right ok
cool and we also did do a render test
already I'm not going to put you guys
through it because obviously time and
stuff but we rendered out this actually
I duplicated this clips and I made it a
10-minute long file attendant a long
time line and we render that out
h.264 in about 16 minutes and 26 seconds
which is not bad for 4k so I think
you're in good shape for 1080 for sure
and on that note I think we should also
take a look at some gaming performance
let's let's get into the fun stuff so
let's go ahead and switch gears to maybe
csgo and stuff so we we tried out on the
MacBook let's let's fire that up alright
guys so Jason has just planted the bomb
here in csgo and he's taken out bots
left and right due to the insanely high
number of frames that he's getting per
second we're at about 290 right now your
300 frames per second going from a
measly 20 to 25 FPS with your MacBook
Pro obviously csgo isn't really a
graphically intensive game by any means
I actually did run a test of GTA 5
before you got here and saw Mac settings
1080 and got about 61 frames per second
on average which is really solid I think
it probably dipped into the 40's at some
point low 40s at the worst which is
still a really smooth experience overall
I think you're gonna be really happy
with the system how's it feel right now
that's its light years ahead of what I
had before I like night and day right
yeah totally so overall um build
complete I'm going to be sending Jason
home with this PC it seems like he's
already getting too comfortable here I'm
in my office here so thank you Jason for
being a part of this thanks yeah and
thank you guys for watching hopefully
you enjoyed it let me know what you guys
think of this little series here maybe
we'll do more of them in the near future
and toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it guys have a good one I'll see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
