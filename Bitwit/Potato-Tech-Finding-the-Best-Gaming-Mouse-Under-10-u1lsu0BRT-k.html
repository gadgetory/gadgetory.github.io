channel today I'm going to be talking
about these five horrible horrible
gaming mice actually I shouldn't say
that some of them are horrible and some
are less much less horrible than others
however they are all in the price range
of less than $10 on Amazon as of now
checking out five gaming mice under $10
each and I'm going to see which ones are
 and which ones are actually worth
buying perhaps now first off why would
you even buy $10 gaming mouse well for
one let's say you're just on an
extremely tight budget that might be the
only option you have or maybe it's not
necessarily for you but a gift for a
loved one spouse you know child friend
who is kind of into gaming but not
really enough to warrant buying like a
$50 gaming mouse for example that could
be a possibility or maybe you're just
looking for a reliable backup well I
don't want a reliable but maybe you're
just looking for a backup Mouse in case
you're your daily driver you know
hits the fan or whatever and you just
need to backup right away then maybe
you'll look into something like this by
the way these are all the top rated some
of the top rated user reviewed mice on
Amazon so that's why I picked them and
I've already arranged them here in front
of me from my least favorite Mouse on
your your right to my most favorite
Mouse I'm going to be going down the
line from worst to best explaining what
works for me and what doesn't so on that
note why don't we go ahead and take a
look at our first contender here which
is the been gue these all have funky
names because they're all you know
Chinese OAM knockoff brands or whatever
and a lot of them are using the same
parts and whatnot but this is Bingu and
you can always tell it's Chinese OEM
crap because it's got like three
different names it's got like game start
hem zone and then the product page on
Amazon says Bangu so who knows what it's
really called honestly the comfort level
is fairly fairly good I like the way I
like the shape I like the feel when I
put my mouse when I put my hand on the
mouse I am a claw grip user so bear that
in mind that's the perspective I'm
looking at this I'll leave all of these
reviews as but yeah the comfort level is
actually pretty good it's fairly
comfortable for my hand and the way I
use mice however it is fairly
lightweight it's actually the lightest
Mouse I believe in our lineup here and I
prefer a bit of heft to my gaming mice
and this is just far too light for that
so I would have to dock at some points
there also I forgot to mention this that
all of these mice are using optical
sensors and all of them are horrible
that's just nature of the beast it comes
with the territory that if you buy a $10
gaming mouse you're going to get a
pretty lousy sensor so just for the for
the sake of argument assume that all
these sensors are the equal amount of
suck now my biggest gripe with this
mouse is that the buttons are all super
hyper sensitive first of all they're
springy especially the front and back
buttons they are incredibly springy and
not very tactile at all the rather mushy
aside from that the buttons are just
really easily pressed and I experienced
a lot of miss clicks when I was trying
to gain with this thing just you know
from moving really fast I would turn
really fast in game and then
accidentally hit the side button it's
also fairly cheap I would say this has
the worst build quality out of all five
of the mice here just not just in terms
of just how light it is but also the
scroll wheel seems really really kind of
wonky and and the DPI buttons in
particularly listen to this is there
even anything in this mouse it's just
completely Hollow it's just like hollow
plastic clicking yeah so it doesn't
sound very good not very satisfying to
click to sensitive on the buttons pretty
much everywhere however it's comfortable
that's the one redeeming quality however
I still would not recommend it even for
ten dollars let's move on to the next
Mouse this one is a fun - a fun - and
again there's like 30 names on here it
also says Zelo tez I think it's just a
much wider profile so it fits your hand
a lot differently it's kind of hard to
compare to the the Ben go however it is
very comfortable I do like it there are
some gripes though that I have the side
here that the the pinky grip is very
slippery on this outer side of the mouse
my pinky just kind of tends to to slide
around on that area and it's not very
it's not the best I wish there was a bit
more grip there and while there is some
grip for your thumb it's kind of got
this recessed these little grooves and
the grooves kind of I don't know they
kind of like sink into my thumb after a
while they don't feel as comfortable
after prolonged periods of time so I'm
not a huge fan of that the build quality
is better better than the been goo
however it's still it's still lacking in
the buttons all these side buttons are
springy here the left and right mouse
buttons are
are pretty solid just kind of like the
nice nice level of tightness that I like
and also the scroll wheel is much better
than the been goo and the scroll click
requires a bit of actuation force to
actually click in the scroll wheel I
wish it was a bit easier it does have a
dpi button for up to fifty five hundred
dpi which is nice it's also got a
braided cable a braided USB cable
actually all these mice have braided USB
cables prising lee except for this one
which is a USB but it's got kind of a
rubber rubber material and i'll get into
that later so my main gripes with this
mouse is that i'm not a fan of the pinky
grip that's super slippery on the
outside here and the the side buttons
and this front button here are very
springy and do not feel very good when
clicking however they are very well
placed I will say that so this next one
is the so tech or so tech I don't know
it's not ZOTAC that's that's not it's
not what I said but okay we've got some
LEDs here that are kind of just cycling
through different colors I don't believe
you can change any of them just like the
Ben go I didn't mention that it also has
a bunch of funky colors seven I believe
that just cycles through the the side
grips here that this side grip on the
outside is much better than the the food
tough which is a little bit more like
kind of a rubberized material and the
inside thumb grip is also nice to to
rest your thumb on however it does
feature those same grooves that we saw
on the food too which I'm not a fan of
again the buttons are relatively tactile
the scroll wheel so far this is the best
scroll wheel that we've seen and a dpi
button is is firm but has a nice click
to it and the issue that I'm having
right now is the front and back buttons
the back button is very accessible but
the front one is a little bit out of
reach for me I wish both of these
buttons were just moved back you know a
smidge a couple centimeters maybe and
that would have been perfect and I was
having some issues with this mouse
anytime I plug it into my - hotline over
here the system would just blue screen
it just crashed instantly I finally got
it to work by just rebooting and you
know rolled the dice by sticking this
mouse in again and somehow it didn't
crash that time so it was so I was able
to test it out more thoroughly
also the even though the the scroll
wheel feels great
in practice it actually sucks when
you're scrolling you know three web
pages and whatnot the speed of the
scrolling flow
2/8 like crazy you'll be going you know
scrolling a mile a minute and then all
of a sudden you'll just like it'll it'll
get stuck if you will and you'll just
have to keep scrolling until it you know
evens out again so so that wasn't really
good is the only Mouse that had an issue
with the scroll wheel like that next up
we've got the Saudi and actually on the
top of the mouse here it says James
donkey I I don't even I don't know but
you can see it's got some nice orange
LED accents that are very subtle it's
got a subtle glow on the backend as well
as kind of peeking through the DPI
button in the middle you know at the
same time looks really kind of a classy
Mouse actually four for ten dollars I
would say this probably has the highest
build quality so far the actual comfort
level is pretty good and actually I love
the weight I love the way it's got some
nice heft to it and it's got these grips
on the side that are kind of a gel
material and they're really like I don't
want say sticky but they're really
grippy and I'm not used to feeling this
kind of material on mice however it
actually feels pretty nice I wouldn't
mind using this mouse just just for
things the scroll wheel is also very
very sturdy it's not wobbly at all it's
got a nice firm click and left and right
buttons are fairly tight the side
buttons are probably my my one complaint
here they're a bit springy and this does
go up to 2,000 dpi I wish it I wish it
went a little bit more than that it's
also got an on/off switch on the bottom
here oh that's just for the LEDs and
again this is the one Mouse that doesn't
have a braided cable instead it uses
this rubber rubber cable and it's it's
very strange I don't know why they used
rubber maze just to go with the style
however I think rubber on for a cable is
not the best because it gets snagged on
things easily there's a there's quite a
bit of friction I'm not a huge fan of
that but overall this is a very
comfortable Mouse and if it wasn't for a
you know the crappy sensor I probably
even pay more than ten dollars for it so
that's going to bring us to our last and
my favourite Mouse personally which is
the TechNet raptor and this mouse looks
very similar to the Coolermaster
sentinel if you remember the CM storm
Sentinel it looks very similar to that
i'm
used to know if they've gotten you know
this working with the same om at some
point however it is it is different and
it's super comfortable it is my favorite
mouse in terms of comfort level simply
be just because it matches the shape of
my hand very naturally but what really
impressed me with this mouse are the
switches the switches for for the left
and right buttons are incredibly tight
and just they feel really good to click
you wouldn't even even think that this
is a ten dollar mouse also the the front
and back buttons while they're not as
high-quality I would say as the the
James donkey over here they do not feel
springy at all they are simply like you
know you go less than a millimeter and
it's just a click there's no spring
spring action whatsoever is just no
 you press it and it clicks it's
a very like satisfying click again
they're plastic switches and they're a
little bit on the cheaper side however
it still feels really good and tight
that's what she said you got a dpi
button I believe this goes up to 2,000
dpi as well just like the Saudi and
again six buttons it's got blue LEDs all
around on the scroll wheel as well as
the body kind of on three different
areas there and the scroll wheel is
actually fairly nice as well it's got
it's got some loose scrolling action
it's not it's not too rigid and the the
scrolling button itself the scroll click
feels just right and it does have a
little bit of texture on the sides here
so where your your ring finger or pinky
would go on the outside and where your
thumb goes it's it's still really smooth
plastic and I would have liked a little
bit likes just a bit of grit material
however they've just got some little bit
of itching to create just ever so
slightly a sensation of grip however it
is definitely notably more slippery than
the Saudi with its with its gel grips
and it's got a black braided cable very
classic and overall super comfortable
Mouse switches are good everything's
good everything checks out so for 10
bucks
yes I would recommend this Mouse I would
even recommend the Saudi I would
recommend the James donkey any day of
the week but if I had to choose I would
probably go with the Tecna
Raptor this is by far the best $10
gaming mouse I have ever had the
privilege of using if you guys are
interested at all in any of these gaming
mice go ahead and check the description
below I've got links all there however
be warned if you pick up any of these
three mice over here I am not liable or
responsible for any kind of pain that
they may cause I would recommend the
James donkey get hop on the James donkey
oh this mouse kicks ass for ten bucks as
well
so either of these two mice I'm sure
that you would be satisfied for spending
ten dollars with I think you know
they're very much worth the money so
that's pretty much going to do it for
now guys hopefully you found this video
bit interesting another isn't too much
information out there on $10 gaming mice
these days but if you enjoyed the video
