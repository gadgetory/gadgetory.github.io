stylings 3 here I think you're gonna
love them nice can't wait to check these
out thanks by the way my car broke down
and I was wondering if you right what
the whoa whoa hey hey stomach
stop don't don't know what's happening
hey be quiet in here Oh Kyle wasn't
prepared to be blown away by the new
silent wings three fans from be quiet
are you for a cooler quieter system
click on the link in the description for
more info what's up guys so it is
already September here in 2016 and that
means it's time for another PC of the
month for today's rig I wanted to see
how much gaming performance we could
squeeze out of a one thousand dollar
budget obviously CPU and GPU are going
to play a big role here and typically
speaking they also happen to be the two
most expensive components in the gaming
PC so I had to be incredibly frugal when
possible without sacrificing too much in
any one area otherwise we could end up
with a high-end SLI configuration
powered by a russet potato that said I
think I've managed to part out a
well-balanced system that won't kick you
in the coin purse but can still eat
maxed out triple-a games for breakfast
so let's dive into the parts I picked
out starting with the core i5 6600 K
from Intel paired with the gigabyte z170
MD 3 H CPU overclocking was a key
feature to have in this build in order
to maximize our in-game performance and
although our board may not be engineered
to hit the highest overclocks
we should still be able to achieve some
moderate gains to copy us a few extra
FPS we also get some useful connections
like this PCIe nvme m2 slot even though
we're too poor to actually populated
with anything for memory I found this 2
by 8 gig kit of ddr4 at 2400 from
Michigan's backlight series my
penny-pinching almost had me resort to
using just 8 gigs for this system but
this competitively priced option allowed
us to fit the rig with a dual channel 16
gig kit leaving two slots on the
motherboard open for expandability in
the future cooling our CPU is none other
than the hyper 212 Evo from cooler mask
excellent bang for the buck value quite
operation and easy installation make
this a no-brainer when trying to shape
cost down while still having enough
thermal dissipation at your disposal to
hit some nice overclocks
now the core component in any gaming PC
that determines most of its gaming
performance is of course the GPU so I've
allocated nearly half of our $1,000
budget to squeeze in this gtx 1070 amp
edition from ZOTAC when i said the
system would be able to crush the maxed
out triple-a titles I wasn't just
referring to 1920 by 1080 but 2560 by
1440 as well the card is fitted with
eight gigs of gddr5 comes factory
overclocked to 1797 megahertz and can be
manually tweaked further with the help
of an additional eight pin power plug
while the carbon wrapped ice storm
cooler keeps thermals in check cool
quiet and apparently faster than a QA
inspection at SpaceX this card really
opens up the possibilities of everything
from quad HD gaming to buttery smooth VR
experiences for storing our games
library we have a 500 gig 7200 rpm
hitachi drive this was the cheapest
mechanical option at this capacity that
I could find at the time and it just so
happens to sport the two-and-a-half inch
form factor now I could have left out an
SSD entirely to keep our cost to an
absolute minimum
but then again booting on a mechanical
drive in a $1000 PC it's kind of like
pairing a prime grade ribeye steak with
a lukewarm can of natty ice so here we
have a 120 gig s60 from silicon power
though this may very well be the natty
ice of SSDs truth be told I actually
meant to snag the cheaper s 55 model to
stay within budget then realize my
mistake once this showed up at my
doorstep even though I'll be building
with this drive today I will be running
all benchmarks in a follow up video
using the s 55 when it arrives if we had
a bit more spending power here I would
have definitely doubled down on our
capacity but for now we'll just have to
be storage conscious about what goes on
to this SSD powering up our machine is
the corsair CX 550 m this unit comes at
a killer price for what you get 80 plus
bronze certification a partially modular
design and flat black cables I also like
having just over that 500 watt
requirement for the gtx 1070 for peace
of mind when overclocking and finally
all of our parts will run inside of this
a petia XQ pack 3 micro ATX case
purchased for a mere $50 on Newegg I'm
half terrified that this is just a
cardboard box that some Chinese guys
spray-painted black
but it received surprisingly favorable
reviews on Amazon and I've had plenty of
good luck with budget cases at this
price point in the past so I'll gladly
take the gamble if it gets us one step
closer to meeting our budget you do get
internal steel construction and dual
side panel windows which is a nice touch
for these boxy cases which feature
horizontal motherboard layouts I will
suggest for those of you considering
this chassis to pick up a 120 millimeter
exhaust fan to complement the only
included 140 millimeter intake and
perhaps the USB 3 hub for more
convenient access should the single 3.0
port on the front not suffice altogether
the total cost of this build at the time
of creating this PC part picker list
came out to one thousand and three
dollars admittingly the removal of a few
mail-in rebates would have added $30 to
our final build
but fortunately that's still not too far
off from our thousand dollar budget now
if there's anything I'm concerned about
with this rig it's what I just mentioned
a minute ago which is the chassis
ability to provide ample airflow with
its single fan to keep our components
cool under long gaming sessions but
assuming that works outcome testing time
the prospect of having this much
horsepower in a $1,000 PC is pretty
exciting so let's put this thing
together and see how she looks
you
you
you
you
alright y'all so thus ends part 1 of
September's PC of the month there's much
more to say about this rig so stay tuned
for part two where we do a full system
analysis of thermals acoustics and most
importantly gaming benchmarks let me
know what you guys think of the build so
far and what you would have done
differently with the budget at hand
