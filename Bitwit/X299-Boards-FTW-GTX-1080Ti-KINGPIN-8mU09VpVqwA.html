standing the day you know what I pay
with EEG honey I was horrible my
coverage of Computex 2017 is brought to
you by be quiet cable Maude Berta gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info so we're
currently at the EVGA sports arena here
in Taipei and just to get us a little
bit warmed up they actually have like a
nice little buffet ready for us I think
that they're trying to bribe us into
really pushing their products to you
guys at home but honestly like what they
think they can just buy me with put some
vegetables and steamed vegetables this
potato protein oh my god that's really
good
even GA for the win just buy their
products right now
look at this guard guys it's the geforce
gtx 980ti king hmm so this card is an
absolute monster I mean first off we got
a triple fan design the the aluminum
heatsink is actually copper plated so
that should provide a bit more bit
better thermal conductivity which is
always nice the EVGA is claiming that
with this card any user can actually
overclock up to 2025 megahertz on the
core clock which is pretty insane that's
a guaranteed overclock not not out of
the box you got to tune that manually
but if you're buying this card I'm
pretty sure you're you're pretty savvy
when it comes to overclocking so that's
a ridiculous clock speed to hit on a
1080p eye and because of that metric I'm
pretty sure that these GPUs are binned
EVGA didn't really 100% confirm it but
they're like yeah you can probably say
that video outs on the back include dual
link DVI one HDMI 2.0 B and you get
three mini display ports right there 1.4
so you know take advantage g-sync and
all that jazz you might use an adapter
though if you look on the back here
we've got back plates very very very
nice back plate this actually makes
direct contact with some of the vital
components as does the base plate I
should say the base plate more
importantly makes a lot of direct
contact with the front of the PCB and
that does obviously provide a bit better
thermals as well now I kind of like what
they've done here on the side you can
see that they've got two eight pin PCI
Express plugs for your power didn't
really confirm what the TDP of this card
is but you want to have a pretty hefty
80 plus certified power supply to drive
it but I do like the fact that these
plugs are on the side because it is a
pre fat card and so just just to help
with a little bit of compatibility
they've got those mounted on the side
for you of course that your mileage may
vary depending on the case you're
actually building in a lot of other
great features here you know you get
multiple BIOS fees or however you want
to say it for just pretty much a whole
slew of overclocking potential features
icx technology so you get things like
the extended pin pin
which is really nice on the base plates
and you get the elf in brackets or the
elfin he thinks in the course just to
add a little bit more surface area for
better heat dissipation whatnot and of
course you get nine thermal sensors plus
one on the GPU for whole at-a-glance
monitoring via precision expose scene
before I forget one thing I forgot to
mention is that if you wanted to you
could remove the air cooler here and
slap on a hydro copper water block if
you want to do some water cooling get
some better thermals and still maintain
a single slot design that's the way the
EBG has designed this card so ultimate
compatibility if you want to even get
better thermals inside of a small
form-factor case you can easily do so
kingpin baby king check out these
laptops guys we've got the SC 15 and the
bigger one SC 17 15 17 inch screens
respectively the screens on these
puppies are pretty insane first off
they're matte matte finish which I
really like Jay was kind of complaining
is like it looks shimmery it looks too
shimmery when you're when you're looking
at text and I do notice that but for the
most part if you're gaming this is going
to be pretty sweet 1920 by 1080 screen
on both models 120 Hertz g-sync
supported which is going to give you a
really smooth experience why don't we
look at the screen it's actually doing
something you're going to get a really
nice gaming experience with either of
these gtx 1060 and the SC 15 GTX 1080 in
the 17 and as far as CPU goes we've got
a mobile skylight chip core i7 that's a
7700 HQ in both of these bad boys I
believe so it's going to be really nice
with hyper-threading if you wanted to do
some streaming even you could probably
get away with that a nice little quad
core in there LED illuminated keyboard
this is actually a first for EVGA as far
as these laptops are concerned I think
there's four different zones that you
can sort of individually program within
the software which is always nice to see
did I mention there's a button on the SC
17 that actually allows for one-click
overclocking so you press that and boom
your CPU and GPU get automatically
overclocked and hopefully the thermals
are pretty decent even then but if you
want to just get really instant boost
without much effort you can do that on
the SC 17 previously DG 7 cases hell
yeah they've got a pretty much full top
to bottom lineups here so depending on
your budget your price point that you're
trying to aim for there's pretty much
something for everyone here so this is
the DG 73 and you can see it's got the
more of a simple design here you don't
get like the tempered glass but you
still get a really nice big window
showing off the pretty parts inside of
your components
to your PC sorry side of the case look
at these look at these little thumb
screws here so such such nice little
attention to detail the EVGA branding if
you go down the line here you'll see
that this one actually has tempered
glass on the front and the side so we've
moved up to the GG 7 5 so again full top
to bottom line up here and then we've
got the DG 7 6 I really do like the
minimalistic design I think it is just
super clean this is sort of the
direction that a lot of the cases are
going these days and I like it I don't
know if you guys can tell from the video
but these are all going to be full ATX
supported cases so perhaps for your next
X 299 system you can go for one of these
ventilation at the top looks good so it
looks like there are two 140 milliliter
fans of the front here so I would assume
that you can do a two hundred and eighty
millimeter liquid area radiator at the
front as well the top I do see some
flexible mounting strips I believe for
also for a two hundred and eighty
millimeter AOS don't quote me on that
but it definitely looks like you can
have your choice of radiator support at
the top or the front of any of the cases
in the new g.711 do those hours my 750 g
3s I don't care about that
look at this click it's SFX SFX ell unit
look at this fully modular yes black
cables I would assume that are going to
be more or less like this aesthetically
beautiful I'm glad that we have more
small form-factor
SFX options and now for power supplies
not just you know Corsair and
silverstone like we've had for a while
now but it's not just the EVGA expanding
this because they do make really good
power supplies IMO and look at this 750
watts in this little this little brick
hand for scale even though you guys
don't really know how small my hands are
they're pretty small so this power
supply must be small too they're also
going to have a 650 watt I believe so
that's pretty exciting we've also got
some other units here this is just some
other some other things that they're
showing off 850 watt these are more
standard ATX form factor so maybe for
for a full ATX build like this like
something like that you want to use with
an X - 9 motherboard from Intel hey what
do you know
EVGA x-29 dark this is their flagship
board I believe for the new chipset the
new PCH from Intel X 299 is going to
support sky like X and KB like X
processors very exciting stuff you might
notice right off the bat only four dimm
slots but why when this PCH supports
quad channel memory with two sticks
to dimms per channel this is mainly so
that you can get higher overclocks
because there it's a simpler trace
layout when you only have half the
number of dense lofts on the board and
there's just a little bit less crosstalk
interference and things like that so
EVGA was actually saying he probably
overclocked something like a skylit Dex
processor two or three hundred megahertz
more by having fewer trace traces on the
board when it comes to your memory so
I'm cool with that especially if you're
looking to overclock
as much as possible and then we've also
got this MDOT to cooler on the lower
region here which is very interesting
you've got sort of a blower style very
flat blower style fan and there's a
believe in EM got to slot right here and
one not right here but actually
vertically I think don't call me on that
either I believe it's one here and one
here anyway it sort of creates the path
of airflow the fan spins intakes air and
actually travels through the cooler and
exhaust it out the back right there air
is exhausted out the back I oh so that's
kind of interesting it'll be really cool
to see how effective this is because so
far the other MDOT two cooling solutions
that we've seen on other motherboards
from competitors have not been very
effective so hopefully this one works
well now this is actually a modified EAP
X form factor board especially designed
by EVGA you'll notice that there are
some pieces of the PCB they're indented
like for the 24 pin ATX here which i
think is really smart designed it sort
of cleans up the cable management makes
it easier to hide that massive cable and
also better clearance as well and then
you've also got another indentation here
for your USB 3.0 header 20 pin header
which i think is also very genius can't
say how many times in a more contact
case I've run into clearance issues with
a right-angle 2010 USB 3 and then we've
also got another one here at the bottom
for your 8 pin I'm sorry that's not a
pen that's a 6 pin for your PCIe if you
need additional PCIe power you can go
ahead and plug it in right at the bottom
there so it doesn't interfere with your
power supply because it is indented as
well moving back to the top right corner
of the x-29 dark we've got a debug LED
or one of them to debug LED the other
one actually reads out the voltage going
to your CPU so just at a glance you can
just look inside of your case or look at
the board itself and know how much
voltage is going to your processor
that's pretty sweet on board buttons for
power and reset
plenty of fan headers thing
like that x29 dark also comes with this
nice little PCB with these giant
standoffs so you can actually use this
as sort of a makeshift test bench or a
work bench
if you wanted to which is which is also
very powerful this motherboard right
here is the X 299 for the win
Hey and this is definitely the most
unique looking board I've ever seen from
EVGA actually the first of its kind with
RGB LEDs ebj in the past has been known
to not really mess around with RGB on
their motherboards in particular but
here we go they've actually caved and
this could be a good or bad thing I
think it's definitely not a bad thing
especially if you can disable the LEDs
which I believe you can through the
software but very programmable you've
got a few different zones here one where
your audio shield is your audio layout
chipset of course vrm heatsink and the
rear i/o so it'll be interesting to see
if you can actually program them
individually
I would I would believe so but don't
quote me on that either just a really
nice little board here you do get quad
channel memory with eight DIMM slots so
for those of you who maybe favor the
additional memory capacity over the
utmost overclock you might want to go
for this board now the 401 K you do get
two m dot 2 slots just like you did on
the X 2 99 dark however there is no m
dot 2 cooler so that is one thing that's
missing out but you still get just like
the dark you get poor PCIe gen3 slots so
definitely plenty of room for expansion
cards and finally the last X to 99
motherboard that EVGA has on display for
today is their micro X 299 micro because
the micro ATX board did and it looks
like you've also got some RGB elements
the same as we saw on the for the win K
just except for it's only on the vrm and
the rear i/o but still looks really cool
i should also mention it's sort of I
don't know interesting honeycomb design
is also very much matchy-matchy with
their their new graphics cards like the
SE 2 and the for the 1-3 gtx 980ti which
you guys are already familiar with
because i did a review on that one but
yeah i think it would be really cool to
see all of you all these hardware pieces
fitting together and really coming
together from a cosmetic standpoint
because it is
it does match pretty nice and yes
fifth pentakill of the day what can I
say I'm a natural but I want to say a
huge thank you to EVGA for inviting me
over here to their awesome gaming arena
and just checking out their cool new
hardware they have in store guys go
ahead and check them out in the link in
description below they are one of my
awesome copy tech sponsors here for 2017
along with verdaguer cable mod and be
quiet thank you all so much for allowing
me to be here and thank you guys for
watching have a good one I'll see you in
the next video for Computex 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
