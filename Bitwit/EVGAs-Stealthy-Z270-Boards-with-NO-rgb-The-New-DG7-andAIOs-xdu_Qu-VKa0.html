description below or never game above
sixty Hertz again alright guys we are
now at the EVGA booth checking out their
new case the D g7 now if you guys are
familiar with the DG eight it was about
thirty times larger than this case and
maybe a little appeal to a little bit
more of a niche market this is a bit
more of your standard tower it's a mid
tower if it's a full ATX motherboard and
it's got some pretty cool features on so
why don't we go ahead and check it out
first off you've got this really nice
sleek front panel which looks very
minimalistic and stuff you do get a side
panel that is made of full tempered
glass that is tinted also so I bear that
in mind if you're putting LEDs in here
they will be muted just a tad but it
does have a really nice stealthy look
you can see there's a power supply
shroud at the bottom now you can see
here we've got the EVGA cutouts I was
talking to Jacob he's not sure if that's
like a hundred percent final and there
are certain things in here that they
might change with a final revision
that's going to be brought to market so
take everything here with a slight grain
of salt looks like there's actually some
some holes here for what I would imagine
our SSD trays maybe you could see some
like SSD action right here on top of the
power supply shot it looks like there's
a cutout here for some cables from your
graphics card they said that these are
going to be grommeted so that's a really
good sign I was about I was about to say
like whoa no no grommets because we are
looking at about anywhere from 100 to
150 dollars for this case so that's good
if the are going to be including rubber
grommets at that price point let me go
ahead and turn the case on its side here
so we can take a look at radiator
support this will open up a little bit
more lighting for you guys to see what's
going on here so at the top you get
looks like a 240 at least a 240 might
even be able to do a 360 up there but
they again they're still working with a
final version this is just a prototype
and we've also got what looks to be a
240 at the front of the case there's
plenty of space here for a thicker
radiator if you do want to do some
serious liquid cooling that is good to
see and on the final note we were kind
of having a controversial debate on this
there's gonna be a DG 7 or at least one
of the models that they have here has a
big DG 7 piece of branding on the front
of the the side panel there and they
were kind of debating like whether or
not you guys would find that interesting
or cool or distracting or ugly so let me
know in the comments down below what you
think of that
and of this case overall let's go ahead
and see what else they got here Z 270
motherboards omnomnom so we got three
three models here Z 270 Stinger I mean
the ITX cute very very similar to the
z170 except it's got a few tricks up its
sleeve of course we're actually got - we
got a type-c connector on the back there
which is Gen 2 that's nice to see also
this kind of has the triple-threat
design that I was talking about earlier
and one of the other CEOs videos where
for a mini ITX board it's got the color
neutral theme going on where you can
pretty much match it with any other
color to your heart's content
you've also got m2 on the back now
that's one thing that was lacking from
the the last generation of stinger
boards was a no-no MDOT - unfortunately
but now you can see we've got one an
nvme slot right there
on the back of the board and thirdly
you've got Wi-Fi so it's built-in Wi-Fi
module unit right there allowing you to
kind of take this anywhere you want and
pretty much connect to any network so to
speak that that you would trust of
course but a pretty nice little board in
a $199 package you guys let me know what
you think of that price point moving on
we have the Z 274 the win K you can see
here we've got a very nice all-black
aesthetic design very similar to the
stinger and actually Jacob from EVGA
said there's not gonna be any RGB LEDs
on these boards which some of you will
hate and others will of you will surely
rejoice with glee
because after after seeing what what CES
so far this year has to offer I say 90%
of the stuff I've covered contains RGB
lighting and it's kind of refreshing
honestly to see just something that's
super blacked out and and the fact that
they've taken and saved
whatever money on RGB lighting and
implemented it in other areas is also
nice to see I also really like the fact
that they've got two of the USB 3.0
headers that are both right angle just
peeking out at the bottom there bottom
right corner of the motherboard and last
but not least we have the z2 70
classified K which if you guys are
familiar with EVGA you know classified
represents their cream-of-the-crop
products pretty much no stone left
unturned here so he's got pretty much
full feature sets you've got of course
USB 3.1 gen2 type-c on the back there
and pretty much just a full-featured
board again g2 70 it's going to be
excellent for overclocking out of all
the boards here you probably get the
highest frequencies on the classified K
for sure
what is this EVGA has a iOS now
Jesus they actually have a lot of them
too this is pretty sweet
so I guess we'll start off over here and
work our way down this is a pretty much
a 240 millimeter AIO
and it looks pretty standard I mean
you've got some RGB LEDs of course on
the front with beautiful EVGA branding I
actually really do like the water blocks
here it gets sort of sort of that
braided material on the tubing itself
which is also kind of nice to see super
flexible looks very durable as well a
new fan design check that out I actually
like the blade design and as far as the
fins go and if you look at the the frame
itself how kind of like dips around the
edges that's actually supposed to reduce
some of the fan noise so does kind of
add like a nice aesthetic to it but it
is functional as well and of course this
is just standard closed closed loop but
for those of you who are looking to
maybe expand your selection in your
chassis you've also got the QR radiators
QR stands for quick release you can see
here you've got actually got some quick
quick release latches here so you could
expand this you could actually connect
it to a GPU like the EVGA huger qrg
hybrid that we have over here
it's actually they've worked hard with
ACE tech to actually implement a water
block inside of that card is that a gtx
1070 or 1080 as the 1080 right there so
definitely you're probably need some
decent cooling there and if you wanted
to actually just hook that up with with
one of these radiators for your CPU you
could have just one all-inclusive loop
sometimes you can get kind of messy if
you have separate radiators and separate
loops going on for your CPU and your GPU
trying to find a place to mount all that
with tubes crossing over and stuff so
this kind of creates like a really nice
elegant seamless solution for for water
cooling enthusiasts all right guys that
is gonna wrap it up for the EVGA booth
full dark in here thank you that's gonna
wrap it up for the EVGA booth here at
CES 2017 thank you all so much for
tuning in I'd like to give a huge shout
out to my sponsors fractal design MSI
and cable mod guys be sure to check out
their stuff in the description below and
I'll see you all in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
