case for your next silent build click
the link in the description below for
more info what's going on guys welcome
back to the channel so it is about 755
a.m. on Black Friday morning for those
of you who are unaware Black Friday is
the biggest shopping day here in the
United States and it's also the day
where you can get the best deals on
pretty much anything so we've actually
made our way over here to Micro Center
in Tustin
it's just moments before the door is
open you can see that the line is
already backed up where it were actually
parked on the side of the building and
the lines already wrapped around Y if
you sauce is actually standing in line
right now while I sit here in the car
because I don't want to get recognized
by anyone before I even enter the
building and I don't want the whole
thing to turn into some kind of fan meet
up we're gonna be building a $500 PC
that's the budget we're working with we
could have gone $800 a thousand bucks
but I feel like 500 is really gonna
challenge us so we've got a couple
things against us right now like Ram
pricing GPU pricing but at the same time
in his Black Friday so hopefully we can
build the best gaming PC we can for a
$500 budget the lines moving we got wife
and sauce Collins yeah
so the first course of action I think is
probably to get a CPU I generally start
with the C Q and party how to build so
in the course it's gonna get really
crowded there really quick so let's do
that
swiftly while the CPUs are already
swarmed particularly seems to be high
interest in the rise in CPUs which makes
a lot of sense given all the price drops
lately all right 1500 X here for 160
we've also got horizon 3 1200 400 bucks
save 10 bucks I'm gonna go with this we
get a quad-core we can overclock it well
beyond 3.1 gigahertz and I think at this
point I'm gonna have wifey sauce is
actually already in line there's the
lungs line just for CPU ordering so
while she's doing that I'm gonna pick
out a be 350 motherboard or an a320
motherboard we have an Asus Prime a 320
mm k 454 dollars $55 that's a pretty
good deal actually what's like a micro
ATX board it's only got two DIMM slots
but yeah that's totally fine one
full-size by 16 slot this is literally
the cheapest a and 4 board they have
here so I think this is our guy I think
these are a little bit underpowered for
our budget I was thinking the GTX 1050
or a TI depending on what kind of
pricing we see we've got 140 bucks 140
bucks for this GTX 950 or I was buying
this guy Tim TTI superclocked for 160
but I think this might be our winner
here for a GTX 1050 Ti well it's not
super clock or anything we can just do
some manual overclocking but 145 bucks I
just checked online this is about 20
bucks cheaper than Amazon has right now
and about 10 $2 cheaper the Newegg so I
think tentatively we'll pick this guy
out if we have any left over maybe we
could go for like a 1063 gig but this
this should be a nice pairing for our
CPU right this is where we're gonna get
killed
we've got an 8 gig HyperX fury this is
just a single module for 95 bucks
or for the same price we can get a 6
another eight gig stick
but to buy four gigs so I think
dual-channel makes a lot more sense YP
sauce is calling me sorry you get it
cool so that was for the 1200 right yeah
for 100 bucks right so let's let's do
the math here really quick this is $95
that's one hundred and ninety five one
forty five fifty five three ninety five
so we literally have a hundred and five
dollars left in our budget 105 105
dollars to get case power supply the CPU
comes to the cooler so that's that's
good we just need case power supply
storage and storage all right I think I
think it's gonna be tight but I think we
can manage
all right case or no what should we do
next look honey this is a 400 watt
Diablo tech for 15 dollars these are
these are actually known to catch fire
this isn't lodgest 480 17 bucks 17 bucks
this is not quite as bad as Diablo tech
but not a huge step up either we
probably couldn't afford something like
a semi quality and tech power supply
because these are going for 35 so that's
a no-go what is this logic says 650 watt
25 bucks what 80 plus seriously okay
let's let's hold on to this for now so
we have like 80 bucks left for a case
and storage I did not see any hot enough
deals on SSDs to make NAND flash an
option for this rig so I did find a one
terabyte Toshiba drive for a mechanical
drive for 40 bucks that would give us 40
dollars for a case I say we just do it
yeah we we finally decided that we
needed a cart we have a couple case
options here we have a thermal take v 3
Black Edition for 35 bucks this is used
of course it's missing like five and a
quarter inch cover here but I don't
really care about that I just like how
the front is all mesh so we'll get some
pretty decent airflow even though we
have some fairly low powered components
in here this is more or less within our
budget
44 bucks but it looks pretty closed off
is another thermal take case I'm just
not so sure about the front panel I
don't know where the hell the intake
comes from maybe you'd be right there
yeah that's that's probably not gonna
cut it
there's also I was thinking this guy
right here but
so that's a little over a budget and its
mini-itx alright so I ended up going
with a thermal take one even though it's
got a missing cover here it still seems
to be much higher quality than the
Coolermaster case it's got a black
painted interior where the other one
does not
it's also got a single included 120
millimeter fan in the back there that I
might actually install to the front just
to give us a bit more intake and
positive air pressure and then at that
point I think I think we're good I think
we're done let's check out so it
actually turns out we had pulled the
model piece or the display case which is
a no-no so we accept the wait in line
right now since they can pull in from
the warehouse but that's awesome because
I was under the impression that we were
just gonna get that case we're actually
getting a new one for $35 a new case for
35 bucks cents that's awesome and then I
think that still means we have five
dollars left over for all the RGB in the
world priorities so actually we just got
the v3 here it is a friendly staff
member brought it out first but also
suggested that there was another case
that was only five bucks more which is
within our budget that is a little bit
better so we have $40.00 case here the
Thermaltake versa h22
actually has more than one fan in it I
think there's like I think he said look
fee was like three or four fans in here
it looks just about as good in terms of
build quality as the other one but look
usb3
that that pretty much sold me right
there so that really brings our total to
exactly five hundred dollars before tax
so we I think there it is right there
there she is
yeah thank you so much sir
can you confirm the total once more for
us please and that's with or without tax
oh yeah
charge it alright well that was a lot of
fun I enjoyed our little shopping spree
there at Micro Center but it was also
pretty hectic on Black Friday and also
I'm happy to be away from the crowds but
we've got all of our Hardware here laid
out in front of us this is we're seeing
all of it together for the first time so
I was just gonna quickly run down each
of them just give you a quick refresher
on what we came away with and then we
can go ahead and start building I'm not
gonna do any testing until part two is
gonna be a two-part thing forgive me if
you guys were expecting performance
numbers in this video but at the very
least we should be able to put together
a pretty nice build for our $500 budget
starting with our rising three twelve
hundred we got a quad core does not
feature SMT so we only got four cores
and four threads with a base clock of
3.1 gigahertz we're pairing that with an
Asus Prime a 320 MKS micro ATX
motherboard a m4 of course on the a320
chipset I've actually never built a
system with the a320 chipset before so
that's kind of exciting it looks like a
pretty decent board I mean it's very
basic it's got you know all the things
you would need it's got MDOT - looks
like it's got a USB 3.1 header on there
repairing that with an 8 gigabyte kit of
HyperX fury this is actually a 2 module
kit so we've got two sticks with four
gigs on them each running at 2400
megahertz or mega transfers per second a
Lodge assist 650 watt power supply which
I initially saw to be a B+ but it's
actually 80 plus gold not just I thought
it was just like you know weird like the
really low-end 80-plus where it doesn't
even have a metal attached to it this is
actually 80 plus gold so and the fact
that we're running a pretty low power
system means that we'll definitely have
enough juice to drive everything but
again let's just hope that it knock on
wood
just doesn't blow up then we've got a
GeForce GTX 1050 Ti from EVGA this is
just a regular gaming edition card it's
not super clocked or super duper clocked
or anything like that but it does have
four gigs of gddr5 and it
is a pretty nice card for entry-level
game this is gonna get our foot in the
door to PC gaming for under 500 bucks or
under or around $500 and we have a one
terabyte Toshiba hard drive I believe
it's 7200 rpm it doesn't say anywhere on
the actual package maybe it says on the
drive so it doesn't actually list the
RPM anywhere on the hard drive either so
I would assume and definitely hope that
it is 7200 rpm and if there was one
regret of this entire build it's that we
just didn't have the budget to get an
SSD in here so we are gonna be suffering
from some slower boot times and load
times and things like that but it's
certainly something that's easy to
upgrade later down the line and at the
very least we can get the system up and
running just fine
and finally we've got this thermal take
versa h22 plus mid tower case it is very
entry-level I've actually never worked
with this case in particular before so
I'm very curious to see what we'd get
out of it for the 40 bucks we paid but
those are all the parts guys I'll link
everything in the description below in
case you want to find out more or you
know links to buy and stuff like that
but I think we're ready to start
building so let's go ahead and piece
this together
all right guys system is complete
I went pretty smoothly actually I should
mention that this case comes included
with four case fans that's pretty
impressive for a $40.00 case and they're
fairly quiet
I mean mind you I actually had to pipe
two of them into a couple molex to two
pin adapters straight from the power
supply because we only had two fan
headers on our motherboard including the
CPU fan header but all things considered
it's fairly quiet it's not too intrusive
and you can definitely feel like quite a
bit of air moving moving through the
case which is nice cable management in
this case actually wasn't as bad as I
thought I mean obviously you don't have
a power supply shroud or fancy rubber
grommets you can't really expect to have
those things with a $40.00 chassis but
that being said you do have ample room
behind the motherboard tray it's about
half an inch which doesn't sound like a
lot but it's actually plenty considering
the type of hardware that you would be
putting inside of a case like this so
that is to say that I was actually able
to get all the cables out and away from
this main compartment area the main
chamber so that we just have unimpeded
air flow going through our case you
might see the power supplies a little
scuffed up that's because I actually had
to remove or I didn't have to but I
decided to remove the ugly sticker that
was on here I didn't film that and think
it was that important but in the process
I kind of scuffed up the power supply
trust me when I say that it looks better
scuffed up like this than it did out of
the box on a final note we didn't really
have the budget to make this system look
as pretty as it could possibly be you do
get a blue LED fan at the front which I
was unaware of so I guess that's our
sorry excuse for bling for today's build
but that is pretty much its overall
lovely build a lovely foot-in-the-door
for PC gaming and for less than $500
mind you or I guess more than $500 if
you consider tax in the state of
California but wait for part 2 part 2
I'm gonna be testing this guy we're
gonna be doing some overclocking will be
checking out benchmarks and taking a
closer look at thermal and acoustic
should be fun so guys thank you so much
for tuning in hope you guys had a good
Black Friday can decide to shop whether
online or in-store hopefully
we're able to take advantage of some
killer deals let me know what you got if
anything for Black Friday in the
