devil aha Radeon rx 580 Hey look it's a
new video card from AMD just launched
today if you're watching this at the
time of upload how exciting alright so
in particular we're gonna be talking
about the rx 580 today however it does
fall within the rx 500 series there are
two other cards I believe that launched
today as well the rx 570 and rx 550 and
it's very exciting stuff now for those
of you who are unaware the rx 500 series
is essentially a polaris refresh so this
is using the same GPU as we saw in the
RX for 80 for example however there have
been some minor improvements to make it
a bit more appealing now this is in no
way something that you should upgrade to
if you have an Rx for 80 currently I've
already run about five games comparing
this to an Rx for 80 Strix from Asus and
there's only about a one to three
percent performance bump with the Red
Devil here so this is really targeted or
aimed at consumers or users who have had
their graphics card for maybe two plus
years who are looking to upgrade we're
going to be starting to feel the
sluggish woes of their video card or
their whole system and who may
potentially want to jump into the foray
of 1440p gaming but are on a relatively
tight budget and can't spend more than
250 bucks or so MSRP of this card in
particular is very attractive at $230
u.s. at the time of filming that's very
competitive and it also positions it
right in line with the gtx 1066 hereby
variant from good ol Nvidia so which one
should you get I don't know we're not
going to answer that in this video but I
will give you my opinions and feedback
on the RX 580 after I've used it for a
bit by the end of all this so very
exciting stuff here actually why am i
filling the box the cards right here you
guys thought the card was in the Box the
whole time didn't you
I'm sneaky but here here's the card very
nice card actually it's not too long I
like it so she said it's about seven or
eight inches long so it can still fit
into some tight spaces oh man I'm on a
roll today basically what you need to
know about the 500 series is that it's
rocking a newer generation of FinFET 14
so it's going to lead to some better
performance per watt it's definitely a
bit more power efficient than the RX 4
80 was and you also got some higher
clock speeds and AMD is kind of dialed
in some higher clock speeds out of the
box here I believe this one in
particular it will since its factory
overclocked that's also a bit higher as
well so I think
hundred and 80 megahertz on the core
clock is what we're rocking here with
this particular variant that's about
three percent higher than the reference
clock speed of thirteen hundred and
forty megahertz so a nice little boost
there thanks to power color but the
other things I want to say about the 500
series they do support these various
technologies including the direct 12
hour Direct X 12 and Vulkan API now know
how much you guys have heard about
Radeon chill but just to touch on it
really quickly if your character is not
moving in game or standing really spill
chill will pick up on that and actually
drop your FPS because you don't really
need it all that much let's say you're
camping or something and and that
basically saves a lot of power or it
saves power and it can save a lot
depending on the game that you're
playing but that in turn can also lower
your temperatures quite a bit so the
only downside is that there's only a few
games right now that are whitelisted for
this technology with hopefully more
games to be supported in the near future
we've also got free thing - how awesome
is free Singh - I mean not only are you
attacking as lower frame rates that you
weren't able to get the free sync one
but it's just a much cheaper technology
to actually get in your house I mean
I've seen free sync panels go as low as
like a hundred and something dollars but
you don't see that with a GC supported
display it just doesn't happen so
especially if you're targeting a card
like this for around two hundred and
thirty bucks you're probably not almost
want to spend an arm and a leg on a
monitor so I mean hey this is a really
great option for budget gamers who still
want that adaptive refresh rate the
other thing that's nice about the rx 580
over the gtx 1066 gigabyte variant is
that it's got eight gigs of gddr5 so
especially here playing at 1440p it's
nice to have that additional frame
buffer man it does come in handy believe
it or not and it can really drop your
frame rate or your frame times if you
don't have enough that be ram so that's
also another big perk here so I think on
that note I'm ready to pop this guy in
the test bed or in the other test bill
that we have here let's talk about that
really quick we've got to define s from
fractal design they've also provided the
power supply here the fractal mutant 600
watts it's an old unit had it for a few
years but it still works we've also got
a 7600 K from Intel - Core i5 kb lake
overclock - 4.8 gigahertz at 1.35 bolts
on a hyper 212 turbo from coolermaster
we've got an MSI Z 270 gaming Pro carbon
for our motherboard 16 gigs it's a 2 by
8 gig kit of g.skill tried NZ 3200 ddr4
of course and it is operating at that
rated frequency and
a big drive right here is the Rd 400 a 1
terabyte m2 SSD nvme baby from good ol
Toshiba ocz Hales yet alright I say we
get this card locked and loaded fire up
some 1440p games and see what she's made
of let's go
you know Before we jump into some games
why don't we overclock this guy and see
how far we can take her how about that
that sounds fun let's go ahead and maxed
out our power limit implements already
maxed out on the slider so again we're
operating at thirteen hundred and eighty
mega Hertz right here on the core clock
out of the box I'm going to go ahead and
let's see if we can do fourteen hundred
and twenty blaze it okay I know it's
only been a few seconds but I'm
impatient because I'm filming a video so
I'm going to go ahead and crank it up to
fourteen hundred and thirty fourteen
hundred and forty come on fourteen
hundred and forty and for gaming at
1440p we have to be able to hit fourteen
hundred and forty megahertz it's only
right dare I try fourteen hundred and
fifty I den okay I'm going to call it
fourteen hundred and fifty megahertz
right here guys I think that's pretty
good we've got two let's see what is
that a 70 megahertz offset from thirteen
hundred and eighty to fourteen hundred
and fifty I'm cool with that let's go
ahead and overclock our mammaries here
I think this maxes out at twenty five
hundred if I'm not mistaken which Oh
twenty to fifty sorry which I'm going to
go ahead and say yes on that let's see
if we're in good shape which it looks
like we are I'm not seeing any
artifacting so I'm going to just say
this is a really quick overclocked quick
and dirty overclock I'm going to say
it's stable it could very well not be
but that's what I'm gonna go with for
now so let's just jump in this games if
it crashes it crashes we'll go back to
the drawing board and readjust our
settings here but I think we're good for
some games so the first game I want to
play here is doom 2016 let's so let's go
ahead and jump into the campaign and
we're going to do who should we do let's
Devo c'n hey let's just do some bulk in
here Foca now I got I got a restart give
me a sec okay so other video settings
here 2560 by 1440 anti-aliasing we're
doing SMA a 1 2 X overall quality ultra
I think we
new ultra now I'm going to try to
enlarge the frame counter in the top
right corner in post-production so
hopefully you can see it but we're
getting around 80 to 90 frames per
second right now which is pretty killer
and say here in the 70s so this is
always I always look at this this
artifact here this little like thingy in
the middle because it usually drops the
frame rate pretty nice so you can see
we're getting like 7080 right now if you
look at other parts of this room we're
getting 8090 go ahead and fight some
demons my favorite thing to do in doom
boom poor place to spawn buddy
unwise so we're getting around 70 80
right now 70 to 90 seems to be the range
which is not bad at all it's incredibly
smooth and I don't know the keenest eyes
either like this this feels like a GTX
1080p I to me a guy I experienced no
difference like once you get above like
75 FPS for me it's all it's all the same
and some of you guys might be completely
different be able to actually feel that
sort of granular difference there but
this feels exceptional for me so I'm
giving doom a big fat pass for the rx
580 when it comes to 1440p gaming we
were seeing again a range of 70 to 90
FPS in that little section that we
played which is absolutely fantastic
let's go ahead and try GTA 5 now it's a
little bit more difficult I believe will
do 2x MSAA I could imagine a lot of
people gaming it no you know what I'm
going to take MSAA off because we're at
2560 by 1440 it's really not worth the
performance head there everything else
is on very high which is a little
unnecessary there are a couple things we
can turn down here grass does not have
to be hide I'll say soft to shadows
tessellation does really affect
performance much in this game 25 today
okay please think is off I've got a
restart here B so now we're here in GTA
5 of course we're getting
around 40 to 50 FPS it looks like the
game still looks absolutely beautiful
frame rates aren't nearly as high as
they were in doom but overall overall
tracking and overall movement is
relatively fluid and it's not quite as
fluid as dhinam obviously but it's very
playable to do oh my god I think my uber
clocks too high
alright I'm cranking this down to 1430
and let's just take the memory down -
we'll just we'll just leave this at 2100
for now all right
well we'll see how that treats us but
that's okay that we're jumping back in
here that we crashed out because that
sort of gives me another opportunity to
tweak the settings a bit more and see if
we can squeeze a bit more performance
out of this game because I'm not quite
satisfied with that forty to fifty that
means in in really taxing areas we might
even dip into the 30s which can add a
little bit of chop chop to the
experience which is is no bueno so let's
go ahead and go back to the drawing
board here all right round two this is a
getting around 60 FPS right now in the
high 50s low 60s looks like we're about
10 FPS on average higher than we were
before we tweak the settings a bit again
just a testament to how scalable this
game is and it still looks really nice
even though you've kind of now mixed the
settings between very high and high
there's kind of a nice blend there the
game still looks way better than a
console which I guess doesn't say much
but just looking at it you know that
this is PC grade graphics view that
you're looking at it still it's really
nice and hitting that 60fps mark really
does make a nice difference a noticeable
difference to me then when you're sort
of hovering below that I'm going to give
GTA 5 a pass for the RX 580 1440p hell
yeah just tweak some settings and you're
good to go I think most people would be
happy with this level of performance for
sure especially given the price point of
this card again battlefield 1 here we go
this is going to be the last game that
we played today for the full test here
and I'm going to go ahead and say let's
do let's do high
well we'll do high settings first Emmel
so we'll see what what happens there I
don't think we need to change the frame
rate load that we'll be getting to the
200 zone but let's go ahead and see what
we can do here I'm just gonna fire up
the first level here for the opening
scene because there's quite a bit going
on yep
okay looks like we're at 70 75 mid 70s
ooh a 90s okay Wow
70s to the 90s 70 90 range I wasn't
really expecting that it's pretty good
actually
oh I forgot to look where I was going
because I was looking at the frame rate
counter all is renewed nope you guys are
probably getting a better idea of how
the game's performing than I am because
my hands are sort of full at the moment
but look at that oh we dip into the 50s
oh why are you so slow overloading
because I'm dying I'm about to die help
no 44 aw look at that dips into the 40's
so interesting some some some harsh dips
into the 40's there but for the most
part we're rockin rockin in the 70s and
80s zone it's pretty sweet actually okay
how am I not dead yet if this is a real
battle I would have died five like ten
lifetimes that my guy sorry guys that
was you know I think it was okay I
should I should die now I there we go
okay I think we have a little bit more
Headroom here so I say we crank it up to
ultra see what happens and looks like
we're in the sixties 60 70s still pretty
good actually
Wow not bad you
let's see if we can get it to drop into
the 30s if there's like a big explosion
there's a big explosion I'll run into it
which is never advised in a real life
situation but oh my gosh there's so many
people oh wait hey whoa we drop into the
50s right there oh boy yep we're in the
50s we're in the 50s now hell's going on
I can't see anything up John from the
40s
okay well that's that's a pass for me
that'll kill one can definitely handle
1440p with the RX 580 granted this is
overclocked but I'm pretty sure you can
do it right out of the box as well well
hey that was super fun and I did have
gpu-z running the whole time so fourteen
hundred and fifty megahertz was the
highest core clock we hit although that
was with the unstable overclock that I
had sent so really you're looking at
fourteen hundred and thirty megahertz
which still isn't bad and seventy five
degrees Celsius is the hottest our Red
Devil got up to it could be better but
it's not bad
it's definitely not that well well below
eighty degrees is always nice and it
looks like we are consistently at a
hundred percent GPU load which means we
weren't bottlenecked by our 7600 K in
any way so what are my overall thoughts
on the RX 5 80 well so far my thoughts
have been overwhelmingly positive
because in the hour and a half at I was
gaming with this card while making this
video I was really surprised and quite
frankly impressed with the frame rates
that it was able to pull off for 230
bucks this is a better value than the
asus strix our X 480 but I was testing
with it earlier it outperforms that card
it has better power efficiency and it
supports the latest technologies from
AMD altogether making it a really nice
package for budget gamers who still want
to branch outside of the realm of 1080p
gaming for 1440p gamers I mean this
really puts 1440 within the realm within
reach of a lot of gamers who don't have
a thousand plus bucks to spend on a full
system I'd say you could probably get
away with a 7 to $800 build and still
play 1440p games over 60fps with the use
of this card not the Red Devil per se
and by the way this is not like a green
light on the Red Devil variant of the rx
580 I'm just talked about the 580 I have
not done
a full review of the power color red
devil so no way am i recommending this
very yet so we're decide about the 580
here but its overall very very solid
very solid GPU and honestly again if you
have an AR X 480 do not upgrade to the
580 it's not it just doesn't make sense
however if you were considering the 480
then get this instead it's much better
Buy in my opinion again I would still
need to test this also against the GTX
1066 gig variant from Nvidia it'd be
interesting to see how the specs up
against those cards with the newer
faster memory clocks that have just been
announced not too long ago
so overall GG AMD keep on keeping on and
pumping out good hardware as you have
been lately and can't wait for Vega Vega
is the next big thing that's going to be
a different architecture that's super
exciting and it's probably going to
Moore's more so compete with Nvidia z--
higher end cards that should be really
fun to test out when it comes around but
that's going to do it for now guys
that's what I think about the rx 580 and
I'm really happy that it does pull off
1440p gaming very well but you guys let
me know what you think in the comments
below also feel free to toss me a like
on this video if you enjoyed it it does
help me a lot also before you go you can
head over to my store where I'm selling
shirts and other goodies or you can
check out bit wit ultra my early access
ad-free channel the first two weeks are
completely free and if you decide to
stay on it's only a dollar fifty a month
so you can go ahead and check that out
when you've got some time but that's
going to do it for me guys thank you so
much for watching as always have a great
day and I'll see you guys in the next
