devil uh-huh Radeon rx 580 hey look it's
a new video card from AMD it just
launched today if you're watching this
at the time of upload how exciting
alright so in particular we're gonna be
talking about the rx 580 today however
it does fall within the rx 500 series
there are two other cards I believe that
launched today as well the RX 570 and rx
550 and this is very exciting stuff now
for those of you who are unaware the rx
500 series is essentially a polaris
refresh so this is using the same GPU as
we saw in the RX 4 80 for example
however there have been some minor
improvements to make it a bit more
appealing now this is in no way
something that you should upgrade to if
you have an Rx for 80 currently I've
already run about five games comparing
this to an Rx for 80 Strix from Asus and
there's only about a one to three
percent performance bump with the Red
Devil here so this is really targeted or
aimed at consumers or users who have had
their graphics card for meetings maybe
two plus years who are looking to
upgrade would maybe be starting to feel
the sluggish woes of their video card or
their whole system and who may
potentially want to jump into the foray
of 1440p gaming but are on a relatively
tight budget and can't spend more than
250 bucks or so MSRP of this card in
particular is very attractive at 230
dollars u.s. at the time of filming
that's that's very competitive and it
also positions it right in line with the
gtx 1066 hereby variant from good ol
Nvidia so which one should you get I
don't know we're not going to answer
that in this video but I will give you
my opinions and feedback on the RX 580
after I've used it for a bit by the end
of all of this so very exciting stuff
here actually why am i filling the box
the cards right here you guys thought
the card was in the Box the whole time
didn't you yeah I'm sneaky but here
here's the card very nice card actually
it's not too long I like it
so she said it's about seven or eight
inches long so it can still fit into
some tight spaces oh man I'm gonna roll
today basically what you need to know
about the 500 series is that it's it's
rocking a newer generation of FinFET 14
so it's gonna lead to some better
performance per watt it's definitely a
bit more power efficient than the RX 4
80 was and you've also got some higher
clock speeds and AMD is kind of dialed
in some higher clock speeds out of the
box here I believe this one in
particular it will since its factory
overclocked that's also a bit higher as
well so I think 13
and 80 megahertz on the core clock is
what we're rocking here with this
particular variant that's about three
percent higher than the reference clock
speed of thirteen hundred and forty
megahertz so a nice little boost there
thanks to power color but the other
things I wanted to say about the 500
series they do support these various
technologies including the direct 12
hour Direct X 12 and Vulcan ap is now
know how much you guys have heard about
Radeon chill but just to touch on it
really quickly if your character is not
moving in game or standing really still
chill will pick up on that and actually
drop your FPS because you don't really
need it all that much let's say you're
camping or something and and that
basically saves a lot of power or it
saves power and it can save a lot
depending on the game that you're
playing but that in turn can also lower
your temperature is quite a bit so the
only downside is that there's only a few
games right now that are whitelisted for
this technology with hopefully more
games to be supported in the near future
we've also got free sync to now how
awesome is free sync to I mean not only
are you attacking as lower frame rates
that you weren't able to get with free
sync one but it's just a much cheaper
technology to actually get in your house
I mean I've seen free sync panels go as
low as like a hundred and something
dollars but you don't see that with a GC
supported display it just doesn't happen
so especially if you're targeting a card
like this for around two hundred and
thirty bucks you're probably not gonna
most want to spend an arm and a leg on a
monitor so I mean hey this is a really
great option for budget gamers who still
want that adaptive refresh rate the
other thing that's nice about the rx 580
over the gtx 1066 gigabyte variant is
that it's got eight gigs of gddr5 so
especially if you're playing at 1440p
it's nice to have that additional frame
buffer man it does come in handy believe
it or not and it can really drop your
frame rate or your frame times if you
don't have enough that be ram so that's
also another big perk here so I think on
that note I'm ready to pop this guy in
the test bed or in the other test build
that we have here let's talk about that
really quick we've got a define s from
fractal design they've also provided the
power supply here the fractal Newton 600
watts it's an old unit had a few years
but it still works we've also got a 7600
K from Intel to Core i5 KB Lake
overclocked to 4.8 gigahertz at one
point three five bolts on a hyper 212
turbo from coolermaster we've got an MSI
Z 270 gaming Pro carbon for our
motherboard 16 gigs it's a 2 by 8 gig
kit of G scale trite NZ 3200 that's ddr4
of course and it is operating at that
rated frequency and
drive right here is the Rd 400 a 1
terabyte m2 SSD nvme baby from good ol
Toshiba ocz Hales yeah all right I say
we get this card locked and loaded fire
up some 1440p games and see what she's
made of
you know what Before we jump into some
games why don't we overclock this guy
and see how far we can take her how
about that that sounds fun let's go
ahead and max at our power limit temp
limits already maxed out on the slider
so again we're operating at thirteen
hundred and eighty mega Hertz right here
on the core clock out of the box I'm
gonna go ahead and let's see if we can
do fourteen hundred and twenty blaze it
okay I know it's only been a few seconds
but I'm impatient cuz I'm filming a
video so I'm gonna go ahead and crank it
up to fourteen hundred and thirty
fourteen hundred and forty come on
fourteen hundred and forty this is for
gaming at 1440p we have to be able to
hit 1440 megahertz it's only right dare
I try fourteen hundred and fifty I did
okay I'm gonna call it a fourteen
hundred and fifty megahertz right here
guys I think that's pretty good we've
got two let's see what is that a 70
megahertz offset from thirteen hundred
and eighty to fourteen hundred and fifty
I'm cool with that let's go ahead and
overclock our mammaries here
I think this maxes out at 2500 if I'm
not mistaken which Oh 20 250 sorry
which I'm gonna go ahead and say yes on
that let's see if we're in good shape
which it looks like we are I'm not
seeing any artifacting so I'm gonna I'm
gonna just say this is a really quick
overclock quick and dirty overclock I'm
gonna say it's stable it could very well
not be but that's what I'm gonna go with
for now so let's just jump of this games
if it crashes it crashes we'll go back
to the drawing board and readjust our
settings here but I think we're good for
some games so the first game I want to
play here is doom 2016 let's so let's go
ahead and jump into the campaign and
we're gonna do
who should we do let's do volcán hey
let's just do some bulk in here folk and
I got I got a restart give me a sec okay
so other video settings here 2560 by
1440 anti-aliasing we're doing SMA a1 TX
overall quality ultra I think we can do
altra now I'm gonna try to enlarge the
frame counter in the
right corner in post-production so
hopefully you can see it but we're
getting around 80 to 90 frames per
second right now which is pretty killer
see you here in the 70s so this is
always I always look at this this
artifact here in this little like thingy
in the middle because it usually drops
the frame rate pretty nice so you can
see we're getting like 7080 right now if
you look at other parts of this room
we're getting 8090 let's go ahead and
fight some demons my favorite thing to
do in doom
boom poor place to spawn buddy
unwise so we're getting around 7080
right now seventy to ninety seems to be
the the range which is not bad at all
it's incredibly smooth and I don't know
the keenest eyes either like this this
feels like a gtx 1080i to me a guy i
experience no difference like once you
get above like 75 FPS for me it's all
it's all the same and some of you guys
might be completely different be able to
actually feel that sort of granular
difference there but this feels
exceptional to me so I'm giving doom a
big fat pass for the RX 580 when it
comes to 1440p gaming we were seeing
again a range of 70 to 90 fps in that
little section that we played which is
absolutely fantastic let's go ahead and
try GTA 5 now it's a little bit more
difficult I believe will do 2x MSAA I
could imagine a lot of people gaming it
no you know what I'm gonna take msaa off
because we're at 2560 by 1440 it's
really not worth the performance hit
there everything else is on very high
which is a little unnecessary there are
a couple things we can turn down here
grass does not have to be high at all
I'll say soft - shadows tessellation
doesn't really affect performance much
in this game 25 okay vsync is off gotta
restart BRB so now we're here in GTA 5
of course we're getting around 40 to 50
fps it looks like the game still looks
absolutely beautiful frame rates aren't
nearly as high as they were in Doom but
overall overall tracking and overall
movement is relatively fluid and it's
not quite as fluid as doom obviously but
it's very playable
oh my god I think my overclocks too high
all right I'm cranking this down to 1430
and let's just take the memory down -
we'll just we'll just leave this at 2100
for now all right
well we'll see how that treats us but
that's okay that we're jumping back in
here that we crashed out because that
sort of gives me another opportunity to
tweak the settings a bit more and see if
we can squeeze a bit more performance
out of this game because I'm not quite
satisfied with that forty to fifty that
means in in really taxing areas we might
even dip into the 30s which can add a
little bit of chop chop to the
experience which is no bueno so let's go
ahead and go back to the drawing board
here all right round two this is uh
getting around 60 FPS right now in the
high 50s low 60s looks like we're about
10 FPS on average higher than we were
before we tweak the settings a bit again
just a testament to how scalable this
game is and it still looks really nice
even though we've kind of now mixed the
settings between very high and high
there's kind of a nice blend there the
game still looks way better than a
console which I guess doesn't say much
but just looking at it you know that
this is PC grade graphics view that
you're looking at it still looks really
nice and hitting that 60 FPS mark really
does make a nice difference a noticeable
difference to me
then when you're sort of hovering below
that I'm gonna give GTA 5 a pass for the
RX 580 1440p hell yeah just tweak some
settings and you're good to go I think
most people would be happy with this
level of performance for sure especially
given the price point of this card again
battlefield one here we go this is gonna
be the last game that we play today for
this little test here and I'm gonna go
ahead and say let's do let's do high
well we'll do high settings first and
we'll so we'll see what what happens
there I don't think we need to change
the framerate loader I doubt we'll be
getting to the 200 zone but let's go
ahead and see what we can do here I'm
just gonna fire up the first level here
for the opening scene
there's quite a bit going on yep okay
looks like we're at 70 75 mid-70s Oh a
90s okay Wow 70s to the 90s 70 to 90
range I wasn't really expecting that
it's pretty good actually
oh I forgot to look at where I was going
because I was looking at the frame rate
counter
oh dude oh you guys are probably getting
a better idea of how the game is
performing than I am because my hands
are sort of full at the moment but look
at that oh we dip into the 50s oh why
are you so slow overloading that's cuz
I'm dying I'm about to die help no 44 oh
look at that dips into the 40's so
interesting some some some harsh dips
into the 40's there but for the most
part we're rocking rocking in the
seventies and eighties own it's pretty
sweet actually okay how am I not dead
yet if this is a real battle I would
have died five like ten lifetimes except
my guy sorry guy if that was you know I
think it was okay I should I should die
now I should there we go okay I think we
have a little bit more Headroom here so
I say we crank it up to ultra see what
happens and looks like we're in the 60s
60 70s still pretty good actually
Wow not bad you
let's see if we can get it to drop into
the 30s if there's like a big explosion
there's a big explosion I'll run into it
which is never advised in a real life
situation but oh my gosh there's so many
people oh wait hey whoa we dropped into
the 50s right there oh boy
yep we're in the 50s we're in the 50s
now the hell's going on I can't see
anything up drop in the 40s okay
well that's a that's a pass for me
battlefield one can definitely handle
1440p with the RX 580 granite this is
overclocked but I'm pretty sure you can
do it right out of the box as well well
hey that was super fun and I did have
gpu-z running the whole time so fourteen
hundred and fifty megahertz was the
highest core clock we hit although that
was with the unstable overclock that I
had set so really you're looking at
fourteen hundred and thirty megahertz
which still isn't bad and seventy five
degrees Celsius is the hottest our Red
Devil got up to it could be better but
it's it's not bad it's definitely not
bad well well below eighty degrees is
always nice and it looks like we were
consistently at a hundred percent GPU
load which means we weren't bottlenecked
by our 7600 K in any way so what are my
overall thoughts on the rx 580 well so
far my thoughts have been overwhelmingly
positive because in the hour and a half
that I was gaming with this card while
making this video I was really surprised
and quite frankly impressed with the
frame rates that it was able to pull off
for 230 bucks this is a better value
than the Asus Strix our X 480 that I was
testing with it earlier it outperforms
that card it has better power efficiency
and it supports the latest technologies
from AMD all together making it a really
nice package for budget gamers who still
want to branch outside of the realm of
1080p gaming for 1440p gamers I mean
this really puts 1440 within the realm
within reach of a lot of gamers who
don't have a thousand plus bucks to
spend on a full system I'd say you could
probably get away with a 7 to $800 build
and still play 1440p games over 60fps
with the use of this card not the Red
Devil per se and by the way this is not
like a green light on the red devil
variant of the Oryx 580 I'm just talking
about the 580 I have not done a full
review of the power color red devil so
no way am i recommending this variant
yet so there's time about the 580 here
but it's overall very very solid very
solid GPU and honestly again if you have
an AR X 480 do not upgrade to the 580
it's not it just doesn't make sense
however if you were considering the 480
then get this instead it's a much better
Buy in my opinion again I would still
need to test this also against the gtx
1066 gig variant from nvidia and it'd be
interesting to see how this stacks up
against those cards with the newer
the faster memory clocks that have just
been announced not too long ago
so overall GG AMD keep on keeping on and
pumping out good hardware as you have
been lately and can't wait for Vega Vega
is the next big thing that's gonna be a
different architecture that's super
exciting and is probably gonna Moore's
more so compete with nvidia z'
higher-end cards so that should be
really fun to test out when it comes
around but that's gonna do it for now
guys that's what I think about the rx
580 and I'm really happy that it does
pull off 1440p gaming very well but you
guys let me know what you think in the
comments below also feel free to toss me
a like on this video if you enjoyed it
it does help me a lot also before you go
you can head over to my store where I'm
selling shirts and other goodies or you
can check out bit wit ultra my early
access ad-free channel the first two
weeks are completely free and if you
decide to stay on it's only a dollar
fifty a month so you can go ahead and
check that out when you've got some time
but that's gonna do it for me guys thank
you so much for watching as always have
a great day and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
