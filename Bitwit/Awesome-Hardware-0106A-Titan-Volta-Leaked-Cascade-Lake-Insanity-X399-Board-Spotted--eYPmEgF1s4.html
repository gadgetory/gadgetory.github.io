like active right cousin that wouldn't
that try to broadcast it to the same the
same stream and maybe that's one we
didn't I don't know we'll figure it out
later
yeah it's okay hi everybody hey welcome
to awesome hardware we are doing a
little bit of a different time today
it's Wednesday 12:30 p.m. Pacific
usually we do this show on Tuesdays at
5:30 p.m. Pacific because that's the
normal time we do it we're only doing it
weird today because we're Paulette I
have some prep that we have to do for
Computex he's actually on a plane later
this evening going straight to Taiwan I
leave tomorrow night so we have a lot to
do and besides I just came back from
Hawaii last night so I wouldn't been
able to do it yesterday either so Kyle
was out of town last week you missed
last week we know we're going to miss
this next week so that that's if you
guys didn't weren't already aware of
that no awesome hardware next week so we
had to do this one today at a different
time in order to get you guys an awesome
hardware and not go a frickin month yes
in between shows so exactly there it is
also there's actually let's talk about
today because Computex is coming up this
next week and that's when there's lots
of new stuff coming out yeah a lot of
the big vendors have started leaving
little little little seeds little um
traces of information just sort of
teasing what they might be revealing at
the trade show this year which is in
just a week or so so this is very
exciting stuff really quick before we
dive into our first segment I wanted to
just quickly plug my giveaway that I
recently kicked off yeah this is a
$2,000 risin PC featuring a gtx 1080 TI
as well as a 1800 x Rison seven chip so
go ahead and enter that giveaway I can
actually paste the link in chat for
those of you who have not entered yet
it's really easy just gotta be
subscribed to the channel I'm subscribed
yes Paul zero but what if you won what
if you won the giveaway what would you
do enter the giveaway oh well you kind
of already did because you I guess you
have to enter your email yeah I'd have
to go and actually enter what if you did
and you actually won I wouldn't enter
because I don't want to win you what if
you were automatically entered and you
won like would you just would you accept
it yeah I'd accept it and then I'd like
put it up in the background but never
you
is it or what is it people heard of you
yes what if you what if you accepted it
and then just ran your own giveaway and
gave that same PC again give it away but
but the requirements for my giveaway
would be you have to you have to
unsubscribe from castien that's saying
although be rough man that's the risk oh
my god I'm glad you didn't enter that I
know that's run that risk every time
evil man pretending to give away this is
give me the last giveaway ever - you
guys go ahead and enter that it's super
easy to enter and the stakes are high
for this one it's a really awesome
system actually swapping out that dark
rock cooler there with a silent loop 280
millimeter liquid AIO from be quiet it's
not even available in the US but I'm
gonna do that today might show you a
little video I wanted to give you guys
an update just so you know what's on the
line
be quiet coming out with a liquid cooler
huh I don't know if they're releasing it
for the US they like the folks just over
there just someone to mean they're like
God maybe you can find some to do with
it it was like I'll slap it and it's
perfect because I don't like shipping
pcs with these big-ass air coolers on
them these air CPU cooler towers because
I'm just risky usually is separated yeah
and I didn't want to risk you know like
the winner getting the build and having
to assemble it or having to install the
cooler themselves just in case they're
you know more on the novice side so I
figured man if we can stick in the IO
and there might be better for everyone
but um go ahead and enter that and yeah
good luck good luck to everyone who
enters um except for Paul in case in
case you're doing it no luck to me no
luck to you sir and then we are selling
stuff on our stores mile is bit with
tech slash store our beautiful moderator
chat or beautiful moderator sells
processing they'll be posting in chat
the links to our stores throughout the
course of our episodes I've got a bunch
of stuff here hoodie shirts glasses that
are now 20 ounce there now the same size
as as Paul's lovely glasses have
different style but same same capacity
Kyle Schwartz is as big as mine yeah
this is true I finally matched your
Schwartz you can find my glasses over on
Paul's harbor net yes indeed and I also
have some shirts and some decals and
beanies and here's my glass all the
things the ones we're drinking out of
right now is this
really
very very nice-looking speaking of
drinking they hold all kinds of liquor
we're drinking beer even though it's
only like just past noon yeah you know
house it's not morning that would be a
little weird but cheers to all of you
guys thanks for joining us for today's
show I were drinking lost coast great
white today by the way tasty it's just
the great way that they actually sent
you know oh no they sent this up dancin
oh yeah shirts and stuff they didn't
send me any actual beer okay
I'm wondering if there's like disorder
change that if there's distribution
issues with something with something
like that Lost Coast if you're watching
we'd love to drink your beer yeah more
it's good be free beer all right give us
beer just didn't find a polite way of
saying stomata that's the motto of
today's show yes it is so on that note
let's go ahead and run run on with our
first segment which is to fund or not to
fund this is a fun little piece of the
show that I like to do occasionally
where Paul and I take a look at some
kick starters or IndieGoGo campaigns
crowdfunding campaigns and just check it
out see which which of the three that
we've selected for the day we would most
likely fund or back so the first one we
have here is an IndieGoGo campaign it's
the fuse card and there's sort of sort
of a tagline here is your whole wallet
in one card which sounds equally like a
good and bad idea yep um so I guess we
can talk sort of about that but clearly
there's a demand for this sort of thing
because you've got a hundred and sixty
thousand dollars of their fifty thousand
dollar goal funded so they are
completely backed by at this point and
then they got some stretch goals to
complete at this at this stage it's a
hundred and sixty nine dollars to back
this card and to actually get one in
your hands one hundred and sixty nine
dollars to have all of your credit cards
all your debit cards consolidated into
one single card that is the same
dimensions granted as a regular credit
card what if you don't even have a
hundred and sixty nine dollars in your
wallet to begin with then then that's a
problem here to put in your wall look
it's got a little display on it yeah so
it's got buttons it's got a little uh
you know trace trace layout on the whole
thing so it's battery-operated which is
also kind of terrifying because what if
the battery dies while you're out and
about you can't you have no money
basically it does come with a little
portable travel charge
that gives it a boost for 30 days so if
you're traveling or whatever you just
stick it in the little charger and
you're good for a month so I mean you
know that really the the thing is is
like there needs to be an alarm on it or
some sort of alert when you're low on
battery like 24 hours remaining so that
you know when to charge it because
otherwise you could just it's gonna die
on you at the at the most inconvenient
time as most batteries will do was that
on the little display weird the little
display go that was earlier on there you
go so yeah you can see there he's got
blue buttons on on the card
there's buttons on the cards that you
can switch between up to 30 different
cards but you can store on this device
it's got an EMV chip which is the pretty
much gold standard right now in the US
anyways and it's proved to prove proven
to work at retail locations worldwide
one feature I do like a lot is the
remote wipe option yeah that's so it'd
be good that waits that's smart remote
it's Wi-Fi connected its Internet
connected uh yes because there is
location tracking so it is it is dialed
into your GPS in case you lose it you
can track it down which again these are
all sort of good and bad things
potentially on you know how the
technology is used or abused yeah but um
so it's just I don't know it's it's sort
of uh
it adds a lot of convenience but
potentially with more risk so I don't
know some people will totally go for it
others will be put off by it and prefer
the traditional way I don't have if I
have thirty credit cards I'm sure some
people very few people in this world do
but if I had thirty credit cards I I
might look into it because then the
convenience factor might outweigh the
potential risks but I only have like
maybe four or five cards the most and I
don't really mind keeping them in my
wallet and you know it's not never been
much of a problem but I could see how
this is a niche product for else either
you need it I don't like signing up for
credit cards ya know there they can be
they could be kind of risky themselves I
like saving money I don't have yeah so
I'm $169 two back let's let's move on to
the next one see what else we got here
this is the halo back
it's called halo back Kevlar charging
cable I picked this one just because it
seems a little a little silly and
perhaps a bit controversial again though
there's there's clearly a demand for
products like this when you have 63,000
is being funded out of their $10,000
goal yeah with with still a month to go
more or less and it's only it's $17 for
the early bird special $19 otherwise
which at first I'm like that's a lot for
a cable but then again if you go to like
the Apple Store or the Verizon store
you're paying you know 25 plus for a
cable anyway that has none of the
features that this thing does that being
said are any of these features really
going to be a value add for for most
customers for example will you ever need
a cable that's strong enough to pull a
freaking car yeah they did that a second
ago
yeah and they keep showing these extreme
examples like yeah that's cool so you
got lose Wow I accidentally closed my
cable in my trunk door yeah now I can
use it to pull the car and my car is
hanging off the edge of a cliff
all right well right so that will get me
out of maybe two three situations a year
there you go you know for the low price
of twenty dollars could save your life
in your car and while charging your
phone I just forget forget Kevlar as a
DuPont product DuPont yes yes it is it
is made of a Kevlar fiber and charges
three times faster than cables without
MFI certification which they sort of
explained but didn't really explain them
I find I'm not I'm not too familiar with
MFI certification to be honest but it
seems like that the guys pull in this
car they were like you know like for
people who are really bad at parallel
parking you can be a great last-minute
or or if you're a part of like a
strongman competition yeah you just want
to prove like how strong you are but you
don't have the means to do it just whip
out the cable and start pulling
someone's car down the road everyone
think you'll super think you think
you're super buff the cable can bend
over 20 thousand times the average cable
does only two to three thousand times
okay I guess by bending they just mean
the amount of times it can be flexed
back and forth which you know I guess if
you're winding your cables up often then
that can be an issue maybe you're
degrading the the internal wiring
somehow over over a long period of time
however it does always wind up my cables
yes of course of course it does um you
know that could be that could be a perk
the one downside here is that it's only
offered in the lightening connector for
now so iOS users really are the only
ones that are interested there is a
stretch goal however that if they knew
$100,000 which is pretty likely at the
rate they're going right now seems like
it they're 94 then they will then the
users will unlock the type-c and
microUSB variants okay so um you know
with 300k and you get super cable read
yeah I don't know I don't get the red
thing okay look it's red red like the
red cameras what is I don't know a nut
is oh no I think it just means it's red
they just make the okay they'll add a
second color I'll just add some dye to
the Kevlar and Alex red it'll match
it'll match you know so they make like
eight times their original goal they'll
make red oh yeah that's cool but some
people really like the red the you know
the red mark
especially this Intex source loves red
and black especially this guy would go
for that this guy with the red car would
have been way more stylish pulling it
down the street yeah he's just not quite
as matched as he could be look at the
cat it's cat proof there's a cat number
one selling feature that's a feature
yeah I let's move on to our next our
last um campaign here which is proof
it's just called proof it's the first
wearable alcohol tracker
I see alcohol tracking wearable world's
first of course and they just met their
$25,000 goal it just went up about
$2,000 since this morning
so fifty nine dollars to back this thing
as the early bird special $60 for this
sleek wearable that uses disposable
cartridges to track your BAC levels or
your blood-alcohol content levels
through your skin so instead of using a
breathalyzer you know or like having to
blow on something okay it just uses
these replaceable cartridges and
actually detects any sort of alcohol
that's perspiring out of your skin see
them at first I thought it tracked how
many times you lifted your drink to your
mouth that's a guy did it who's wearing
the tracker expose what didn't you
switch hands
this actually is both hands this uses
more more science what if you're
drinking water and maybe yeah or that
what if I just scratched my mouth what
if you're smoking a joint right
we make it very confusing but this makes
more sense then yes so um I like it
already $60 I think if it I think what
what with these kinds of products that
are tracking your alcohol your your back
so to speak your even BAC I think the
most important thing is accuracy right
so depending on how accurate this is
like and my my mother-in-law's
boyfriend is a cop he's like a sergeant
for LAPD and I'd be I'd like blob to
like bring this to him and have him like
use I get really drunk in front of him
and have that track me and then also
blow in his like you know certified cop
standard breathalyzer or betted let you
do that and he totally would be
supercooled it and just kind of see what
the accuracy level is because if this is
evident were you saying here is if it's
accurate then you can really ride that
line you can get right up yeah being as
close to the legal limit is possibly
exactly and then just just joyride yep
it's not about people safety it's it's
about your you not getting thrown at so
angel Keating just standard out that
legal limit correct get out of the begin
of the cop pulls you over like you can't
touch me yeah thank the your you're
driving donuts in the middle of an
intersection I have that drunk on point
zero zero one an alley a living man give
me the angle own technology second say
it happened hit with the future bro
totally so um the only thing that I
could see the downside of this is if
it's not accurate or you know the cost
of these cartridges one of them will
last about 12 hours of continuous use
which is a good period of time if you're
you know out drinking for the day or the
night but they're charging $20 for 10
extra cartridges so you know depending
on how often you drink that could add up
you know I mean you might be spending a
couple hundred bucks a year on these
little cartridges just to make sure that
you're not being a dumbass when you get
behind the wheel but Richard when you
could or instead just you know watch
your watch you're you're drinking
yourself this would be like I feel a
little buzzed subject I won't even need
this product in catch have you said the
cartridges one time you so did they last
for a little bit there on welder it's up
to 12 hours of continuous use so you can
use it for six hours one night six hours
another okay if you want it to you that
way that seems like a lot of breathing
then right because it only takes a few
minutes
you're like a minute right to blow into
the breathalyzer I've only done it like
twice I've actually never done a
breathalyzer really no I haven't had to
use breath light right because you were
racially profiled that's that's probably
true and that doesn't make sense
no it doesn't yeah where he's from they
don't serve alcohol it's actually the
last time I had to use a breathalyzer
which was many quite a few years ago
earlier in my 20s and I wasn't sure what
was gonna happen
I had had a couple drinks I was not the
most responsible thing I've ever done in
my life but I blew like pretty decent
amount under I was fine no but I wasn't
sure because I was at a friend's place
and there was some beer pong and I had
no idea how much I had actually drank
hmm so yeah again I if you're if you're
younger person and you drink just just
don't even risk it yeah
not worth I know this is somebody who's
made a mistake in the past is trying to
say don't do the same thing but always
always go on the safe side especially
now you got Ober like oh yeah there's
really no mo now just usin that's in my
early 20s uber and lyft were not a thing
right and granted there were cabs and
stuff yet yet a dirt Beto's a dirty ass
cab with that creepy guy who probably
touched it some creeper
ya know anyway I feel like we're getting
a little sidetracked yeah of course
point is don't drink a dress no drink
drive and you know DUI is at least in
California can cost you easily easily up
to ten grand
after all the fines and little fees if
they tack on ten grand is like the
minimum for getting a DUI these days so
if you have to pay a few extra bucks
worth of some extra cartridges to keep
yourself in check yes then you know I
say it's worth anything worth it for
safety of other people's lives and your
own so on that note Paul out of these
three we have the fused car dude the
whole wallet in one card
the halo back the Kevlar charging cable
and the proof which one would you go for
I probably go for the proof just because
the Kevlar charging cable I don't see
that much need for also it's only
lightning and I don't have that and then
the the fuse card I mean I don't know it
doesn't seem like the type of thing I
would jump in on an IndieGoGo for if in
this launched and the
is it for a couple years and everyone
and it was like a popular thing people
like wow it's really secure and all that
stuff that I might consider it but right
I don't I don't want to be guinea pig
for something like that absolutely it
sounds almost like too good of a concept
to work you know as well as you'd hoped
hope it would I would I would have to
agree with that
going with the proof so on that note uh
that concludes to fund or not to fund we
can go ahead and roll over to pip my PC
obviously where you guys have sent in
some of your your rigs some of your rig
pictures and Paul and I will now
critique them and tell you how you can
improve the the good tidings or the
tidiness not good tidings cotati fluid
ighting is a great barrel glad all these
festive green and red builds yes we're
gonna go ahead and just give you some
pointers on how you can shape up the
look or the functionality of your pcs
and I see you guys donating in YouTube
chat thank you all you super chat donors
are you are going to be reading all the
comments you attach to those donations
at the end of this half of the episode
so continue giving us money we do very
much thoroughly enjoy yes we do
all right good my PC and start with
Marcus Marcus Claxton Marcus how about
this monstrosity power supply went out a
few months back and I have no money to
replace it
Oh I don't understand that the power
supply went out is that this seems to be
functioning well maybe mmm so is this a
like crappy replacement power supply and
he has no money to get a better decent
more decent looking one that could be
because this looks like it was hastily
wired up yeah I mean not even using the
behind the motherboard tray cable
routing which you clearly have back here
yep um I I say that's just a backup unit
that he had lying around that he okay
sort of stuck in so that sounds more
reasonable yeah I mean honestly the
build itself as far as the hardware you
got going on and everything doesn't even
look all that bad just 100% the power
supply on the cable link right uh put in
a new power supply preferably one that
has you know all-black cabling or you
know if you want to go fancy get some
sleeves or something like that and maybe
80 plus certified yeah maybe that's why
your old one blew out or something like
that
it would be nice this is a Maximus 9
this is a this is a skylake system rkb
ladies at maximum sign
Maximus nyah oh yeah yeah that says you
270 probably uh I'm hoping it's a 7700 K
and there mm-hmm otherwise you spent too
much money on your motherboard and not
enough on your on your CPU yeah anyway
but yeah a new power supply and rewire
that and you got a nice nice system
there yeah thanks for sending that
picture in Marcos thanks Marcos
Jeff jefe well smokes have half a 7700 K
with a gtx 980ti
for the win and an air 540 air 540 case
strong Corsair looks like you got a also
a B be quite dark rock 3 on there which
is a beautiful cooler sure that's the
dark rock 3 yeah is it yeah looks like
it right it looks extremely wide I don't
know what's really what I was gonna say
I was like maybe ain't you big to be the
dark 3 I don't know all right I'll look
at it we'll go ahead and correct him on
some stuff I don't know um all right the
only thing that immediately sticks out
to me just a little bit is the cables
here come in from your GPU they're just
they're crowding up against this fan you
know obviously your fans probably still
fine and everything it's just that's the
only thing that kind of stands out is
not looking perfectly clean there's
other routing options you could go for
with the cables you can you know loop
them down a little bit
these are nice sleeve cables so like
having a nice gentle loop going up or
down or to the side or whatever is fine
just the way they're kind of crunched up
against the fan that I don't like
everything else I think looks really
nice and I don't know what you have
going on making the kind of pink
backlight on the wall here but that
actually also looks kind of cool peeking
through bits
yeah that's outside of the case right
whatever that yeah I think that's
separate from the system it's just right
being reflected on the fans here and
it's nice yeah apparently sometimes it's
the dark free pro which is a super huge
cool I've never heard of that but yeah I
guess it is the dark well this is the
pro 2 is the pro 2 so maybe it's the one
with the dual towers that are underneath
that plate you can see what I've got
dual towers and up you
maybe even duel fans dark Rock Pro yeah
that's what it is it's just bad boy over
here that is this guy yeah perso there's
a DOOL DOOL DOOL a tower with one fan in
the middle there's an additional fan in
there and then slaps oh god it's got
double fan setups yes oh cool
beautiful yeah nice build I like it
thanks Jeff thank you Jeff next we've
got a steady grim spat the grand goals
as a 6700 K gtx 1070 16 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance ram and a Noctua NHD 14 mmm
the old skool 14 not the 15m hmm uh wow
that's that's that looks very nice so I
I almost skipped over this entry and
didn't use it because I was like this is
good there's nothing to critique here
yeah and then I noticed the fans on the
Noctua cooler there Corsair fans and how
they're blowing air to the right the
front of the case it looks like you're
correct and so I was wondering if that
was intentional or if he had made a
mistake because it seems based on how he
has the exhaust vent at the back of the
case like it would sort of conflict and
not really be conducive to the airflow
path that he's trying to go with um yeah
I think you're right and that's a good
catch so maybe flip those yeah a silver
to be yeah if they if these are pushing
air towards the front of the case and
this is pulling air out the back that
doesn't seem like it like there's no way
for air to get in right here yeah so who
knows or maybe he did a bunch of tests
with a bunch of different configurations
and this is some hidden secret
configuration with the nhd 14 that
actually is more affected and you should
share with the class I'm very curious
you got a sense but yeah everything else
looks great you're right you're right
everything's beautiful otherwise he'll
Management's on point yep like gateways
like the the cable training yeah combs
that you got there yeah um clean clean
red and black build and I hope it's not
always on the floor and have the
pictures on the floor right now but
don't keep it on the floor be weird if
that was just where he kept his PC just
in the middle of the carpet sort of I
think maybe it's not because the side
panel
definitely cables coming from up there
okay woman all right all righty Adams
room right out
Adam has an i7 3770 a gtx 960 2 gig
240 gig SSD one and a half terabyte hard
drive 16 gigs of HyperX ram a gigabyte
z68 XP u d for motherboard so ya
thermaltake versa h23 case in EVGA 500
power supply and an optical drive z68
whoo slightly older system interesting
you got 3770 paired with AZ 68
motherboard yeah it's a Sandy Bridge
board yeah cuz the the 7 is 77 does e 77
boards yeah we're out with but it's
still compatible so no big deal there um
he upgraded any 2500 km something I
think the main thing if I'm remembering
this correctly I think the main thing
you would have gotten with going z77
would be that all your SATA ports are
SATA your 3 points gen to rev Rev 3 6
gigabit per second whereas wuzzy 68 I
believe you had 2 6 gigabit per second
ports and the other four were 3 gigabit
per second ports
I could be wrong about that I don't
remember this is this is this is like
2011 we're talking about here to that
great yeah doesn't 10 don't tell one
more lie memory is getting worse
anyway 68 was 2011 yeah so clearly we
have you know a power supply cabling uh
you know issue here as far as looks go
it's just standing out quite a bit
also your thermal take case I'm pretty
positive doesn't have much in the way of
cable man management's know going behind
the motherboard you better CPU
motherboard tray here so you plug is
painful yeah so I don't think you got
any way to pass that through and
but yeah also interesting you have a
liquid cooler here with the 3770 which
is not an overclockable processor but
I'm sure it works just fine this is one
of those systems it's just it's a little
past the point where you'd want to spend
too much
you know fancying it up very much I
would say you know get a new case right
but then eventually going to bake well
get a new platform all together yeah I
mean overall you got everything tucked
away pretty well your air flows fine
it's just it's just you know it's not a
super attractive visually system sure
but if you were to replace one component
in this build for performance I would go
for the graphics card simply because the
3770 even though it's not unlocked or
whatever is still really very decent
chip core i7 yeah and it's not really
gonna bottleneck even like gtx 1060 or
maybe even a 1070 to much I don't I
didn't realize he had a picture with
LEDs in yeah well that certainly washes
everything out yeah that's way better no
kitchen Brewster here yeah that's just
just leave it like that all the time I
know he's he sent his desk set up to I
think get the fire extinguisher in hand
yeah that power is always useful um no
it's good for past exam next up last one
we've got Ben hey Ben Ben Ben Ben you
get a before and after pictures here
with a core i5 4590 eight gigs of ram a
cryo rig h7 great cooler a DIY PC silent
BK window GTX 1060 a 240 gig SSD one
terabyte WD blue and a CX 430 M power
supply with some RGB LEDs thrown in a
nice nice little balance of components
here um I'm looking at the before
pictures here okay the after looks
pretty good
pretty good man that's interesting okay
so you've got started like a mini ITX
board in a ATX tower it mics like it's
micro oh my krob sorry did a distortion
of the pin I feel like truncated micro
camera angle yes you're right it's micro
totally micro um but uh let's see here
um power supply cables maybe some
extensions just to get rid of that if
not just for the 24 pin
ATX everything else looks pretty yeah
black and blends in maybe also add
another dim in there looks little only
with just that single blue stick there
um unless there's another picture where
you've added another one not just a
single memory memory stick so I mean no
do you know it's a dual channel board
might as well take advantage of it and
um I agree the Cape yeah oh he's also
got an EVGA M power link the power line
can I that's that's fun and the PCIe
cables on that are black but the 24 pin
is ketchup mustard that's true
interesting alright so if you get the
extension for the 24 pin and you add the
other sticker Ram and then I just just
throw this out here an idea if you will
if you want to agree cable this thing
these cables all coming down here I feel
like exaggerate how short the board is
yeah and don't look that great as cables
coming down there I would say maybe try
to like I mean see if you can fix up the
color issue here on the end I've tried
different ways to do that with these
cables bring them all this way though
just bring them along the bottom edge of
the motherboard and yeah and tie them
all together as they go along until you
have a bunch with all four of them and
pass them through this way I think that
might
so it's just one seamless Kay dad like
one sort of like you know bulky cable as
opposed to a bunch of different ones
just screaming out that board that might
look a little better I agree with that
completely just a thought but Ori get a
bigger motherboard that fits that case
yeah so I'll sell that one and put it
towards a full ATX board you'll have
more connectivity options probably more
expandable in the future things like
that or do a pulse ed overall though I
mean if you don't even touch it it looks
fine so yep rational and that's going to
conclude for example you see you thank
you guys so much for sending in those
submissions there will be another
opportunity if you didn't get picked
this week perhaps in a future episode
coming soon so let's go on to tech news
knows we got a couple big stories to
talk about here before you were uh
switch it over to Paul's half so I want
to go through them relatively quick
because we are approaching the the hour
mark here we are no no we're not it's
only 106 sorry mom on Hawaii time you
actually almost on point for being like
half
- oh yeah I'm just not used to that ever
happening so glad it is today today
alright NVIDIA in turn there's an Nvidia
intern who is getting fired very soon ha
well maybe not fired but he definitely
leaked a Titan Volta picture or what we
presumed to be a Titan Volta picture he
leaked a picture he liked the picture
and then he's probably been speculated
that it's a Titan Volta card it's all
confirmed Paul's official Nvidia posts
clearly that's an official Nvidia slide
is the image no this is an unconfirmed
source this was taken from Michael sighs
Michael sighs Facebook page Michael
sighs the Nvidia intern who posted this
to his Facebook page like a newb showing
the innards of a full system that he was
working on which looks to be like zoom
in at hand a Titan XV look at our Volta
now again take this with a grain of salt
this is an unconfirmed source but
overclock net took note of this picture
that was leaked and did some analysis
comparing this to some other cards that
are that are already released I'm gonna
zoom I'm gonna zoom in enhance some more
and they believed enhance enhance we're
at 500% we've maxed out the capacity of
Chrome's zoom and enhance function I
like I like how this this article says
you know because there's this the same
golden strip on the on the the card
shroud oh yeah as the voltage evey 100
or GV 102 that they're thinking this to
be a Volta based Titan okay or you could
just see the big word that says Titan it
does on the car so here's say Titan
which is clearly not and it's not a
Titan that we've seen it might say kit
and tickin tickin tickin but it and what
chitin what is the biz the
million-dollar addition what more could
you want
tit and 42 I guess maybe another tit
usually they come in pairs
chitin take the same kitten ass it could
be tit nice though what's what's a good
kid without Smash Ball yeah I think
that's a ya need to be answered yes it
yeah I got some ask people in the Edit
yeah I think that's a Louie CK bit on
that
what about like tits and squeezing tits
and like no one ever squeezes one tit oh
yeah what is aam done once I reckon they
say
okay which briefly distracted good
sidetrack all right so the other thing
that's that's pointed out here is it the
traditional sli cadet connectors gone
done place of a potentially envy link
fingers that are in so guys here where
the s light connectors are usually
exactly they're much thicker they look
like this really fat
chod style SLI fingers anywhere along
this bridge and be linked baby here
which of these is which and be link so
the begs the question is Nvidia really
that close already to releasing a Titan
X V when they just launched the Titan
next little P not too long ago as the
skepticism as expressed in the article
about this is that it is very close to
them recently watching Titan so vultus
does seem like it might be pretty far
off but but then again the article goes
on to say well AMD is pretty close to
launching a pretty promising stack of
HBM to cards based on their Volta
architecture so it stands to reason that
Nvidia might be firing back maybe a
little bit earlier than they intended
because perhaps they feel you know sort
of threatened by aim these offerings
they are the other main graphics
competitor after all and this could just
be a sort of a response to that who
knows this could all be a hoax and we're
all just blowing smoke here but and at
any rate I don't know what do you think
in HBM or I'm sorry what do you think
the sort of specs of a Titan Volta card
would be III jotted some things that I
would maybe hopefully like to see this
might be more wishful thinking than
actual projections but I was I was you
know I wrote down 16 gigs of GV r6
look I thought that was a possibility
depending on yields of GV or six of
course around you know over I'd like to
see over the 4000 coup de coeur mark
maybe 440 320 CUDA cores I'm not asking
for too much and I also would like to
see some some lower person some better
power efficiency maybe if we could load
that down to 200 watt TDP I think Titan
XP is 250 Watts right now and maybe
maybe a 200 watt Titan would be that'd
be a cool first especially if you could
the ad in a single 8-pin plug you think
that's possible you think the next Titan
could have just one eight pin PCI where
are you getting all this information
from Kyle this is all just these are
just random wishful thinking projections
although it's nice to daydream are about
the technology you care about not that
you care about anything Paul Kyle
confirmes Volta Titan Hey Jude said no
such thing if I don't get invited to the
multimedia press conference you know why
Volta Titan specs you heard it here
first on awesome hardware you just draw
the stepped-up I give away Scorpio all
right um as I've lost I mean that would
be cool if you had it I mean I'm still
very curious about the HP m2 stuff
because that that's what all the talk
was about last year and Phoebe launch
and everything and then it's just we
haven't seen much HBM to happening
yeah far so that's true curious about
that yeah that's really funny like
people and chatter like you know go my
god like WikiLeaks Kyle just leaked the
NDA like how crazy would it be if I'm
spot on the ball exactly and envy like I
get a call like whack listed 3d art of
are meaningless like every fucking talk
to us again Kyle be look I didn't even
do see into us I hope I'm not correct on
everything all right let's move on to
the next topic here which is about Intel
good luck living off of Vegas Sam yeah
okay all right uh Intel responds to
AMD's data center marketing plans haha
with their own cascade Lake cascade Lake
SP so AMD as many of us have heard by
now recently announced their epic or
formerly Maples CPU family stack to
compete with Broadwell ep they did we're
gonna be talking more about epic on
Paul's half of the show so stay tuned
for more details on AMD's latest what is
it 16 core 32 thread freaking behemoth
at 32 core 6034 64 threads Jesus epic
yeah I can't even keep up with just how
many cores we were just over shooting
right now but they've also revealed an
aggressive server roadmap with Rome the
the seven nanometers and two cores that
should launch 2018 and Milan with
refined 797 nanometers on three course
in 2019
that that's here okay he's just yakking
on a bone alright so um so after after
AMD sort of was like this is our this is
our roadmap we've got a lot of shit in
the chamber we're ready to go
we're fired up and it's going to be
awesome Intel probably has the fire lit
under their ass at this point and
they're like well we got cascade lake so
they recently announced cascade Lake SP
in response to to all this AMD
shenanigans and that's basically going
to be a skylight EP or SP refresh based
on 40 nanometer + node that's going to
lead to a boost in power efficiency
higher clock speeds and potentially a
higher core count for server server
based workstations this is this is all
secondary though - the main feature that
cascade Lake SP will bring to the market
which is next level memory support do we
mention we're reading at WCC F Tech
article by the way no you're right just
point that out more and more often Thank
You WCC F tech who is the author here
Hasan thank you son we appreciate your
your expertise in journalism and you can
try to piss off it no I'm not I'm just
dummies are casting I'm just saying
thanks for the story
dick all right so this next generation
of of memory will support 3d crosspoint
based on obtained dibs so we're gonna
actually have certain platforms being
able to support up to 3 terabytes of
obtain memory which is insane and that's
just for the 4 socket platforms 8 socket
platforms will be able to support up to
6 terabytes of obtain memory which you
might wonder like from a gaming
standpoint if that's really all you've
ever known like why do you need that
much memory but you kind of have to
remember that there are certain
applications are certain rendering
processes like like a visual effects for
example where it actually consumes you
can consume gigabytes gigabytes of
memory for a single frame that they're
working with if you know if the all the
the effects are crazy enough and
resolution all that sort of thing so
yeah I guess I guess maybe six care
about it makes sense for some people and
and it's you know it's definitely also
like dick
contest at this point between AMD and
Intel numbers are a thing that's why you
saw like you know 15-inch laptops with
4k displays which didn't make any sense
but you know it's a pixel race it's a
it's a resolution race that's all that
sort of thing it's a core race here as
well so Intel did do a demo recently at
SAP I don't know what SAP stands for its
sa P something Spanish Spanish and
Portuguese and Portuguese that's what it
is and don't listen to anything we say
the demo basically showed a xeon e7
88-90 v4 which is a broad well ian chip
in quad configuration against the
Cascade Lake SP and also a quad
configuration with the newer core
performing one point six times better
than the broad well eBay system which is
pretty huge and we can expect a 2018
launch with cascade Lake and more
details should be on the way so it's
kind of interesting to see Intel in a
way trying to keep up with AMD as far as
the press releases go and the past in
very recently just has been the other
way around so this is good this is good
competition not just on the gaming side
of things or for the consumer but also
for you know these sort of server server
situations enterprise level workstation
scenarios so that's cool would you ever
consider building like a Xeon system for
like rendering or anything like that
door I mean I'd consider it it's always
a question of cost it's that like it's
more practical for businesses that are
going to be using it all the time
as opposed to somebody like you know
youtubers or something like that like
I'd love to be rendering out videos on
64 cores and 128 threads on sum or
something like that that'd be sweet
but I wouldn't be doing that all the
time I'm only rendering videos you know
every couple days yeah so practically it
wouldn't make that much sense but you
know if Intel was like here you want to
try this out I'm not going to say no I
just built the system with the 69 50 X
which I keep telling people nobody buy
because it's ridiculously overpriced
yeah but I'll use it sure
it's still fast so yeah and I mean
that's something that I feel like Linus
has has gotten into a lot as he's
expanded his operation up there again
because he's making more use out of it
because he has a bunch of different
editors and that kind of thing I think
that's why in scrapyard warriors like
their original plan that way we can't
talk about too much besides the first
episode that's gone up so far but
they're playing they're going for a Xeon
built they were gonna you know seems
like they're going to come at us with
like a dual Xeon configuration which we
would have been very interesting but
it's not something that as a you know
typical PC gamer you jump it at and go
four or something but right but the
server market is huge so AMD making
inroads to it and Intel responding with
something concrete that you can look at
and be like that's obviously they're
doing that because they have more
competition now I think that's a good
thing all around first time I've been
excited all year about anything obtained
related perhaps oh yeah that too I mean
the opting not obtain memory but opting
in memory modules yes is very
interesting absolutely alright so very
exciting stuff from Intel we can talk
about some other cool things coming soon
from cryo rig chimeric sort of been on
fire lately and Paul's got a nice little
article on on one of their new products
on his half of the show so stay tuned
for that but this is going to be talking
about their new r5 cooler and their new
Cu line of performance cooler cu meaning
a copper of course they're announcing
these two new CPU cooling projects just
before this year's compiex which again
is when a lot of these vendors start
leaking certain information or details
about the products they will be showing
at the event the r5 for starters is a
high-end duel tower which is a pretty
cool I'm sorry dual fan
single Tower is clearly denoted by the
picture with full Ram compatibility so
there you're not going to run into any
issues with with your your module
sticking out too high this is also
something that cryo is really good at is
is you know RAM clearance with like even
like big CPUs this one granted looks
pretty pretty thin all things considered
yeah in the stang itself isn't terribly
like yeah and the compatibility for RAM
is is even going to hold true to X 99
and Intel's newest x2 99 platform so
that's cool I think Greg is good
that's it making plastic based designs
that actually look pretty decent yeah
don't look that much like plastic yeah
like the h7 has several areas like that
which is why it just visually looks so
much nicer than like something like a
hyper 212 right but it looks like kind
of the same thing here they have this
little frame going around the outside
that kind of interlocks I got a good
designer but yeah it looks nice for sure
cool yeah it doesn't look cheap at all
for being plastic there's some there's a
various cooling innovations that are
built into the the r5 such as you know
you get six crier ring high-end copper
heat pipes it's pretty standard I guess
dual fan fin optimizations convex a wine
cooler based optimization multi seg
quick quick mount system which sounds I
think the most interesting here it's the
first cooler to feature this in the cryo
rig stack keep talking and it's going to
be just a quicker and more efficient way
to mount CPU coolers and I think this is
really what all vendors should be
heading towards this is the direction
they should all be heading is making CPU
cooler installation just that much
easier because it is just the biggest
bang for first-time builders and even
for experienced builders like myself
it's like if I'm filming something
usually the longest part of that build
is a CPU cooler and if you know it'll be
interesting to see what sort of method
cryo rig has come up with for this for
this installation not to mention their
instructions are always really clear and
that definitely helps things along when
other competitors can be just so vague
with their with their directions not
enough pictures I like pictures of my
instructions for my CPU coolers pictures
and nests yes they are especially when
they're colored even though it makes no
difference this is just fun it's like I
look guys definitely know that's my cool
if they're talking about it's blue right
huge right there anyway the the Cu
copper line is an enhanced performance
addition of existing cryocoolers which
are a lot of their popular ones are
featured at least based on the pictures
here where all of the aluminum heat
sinks are being swapped out for full
copper construction hmm so you get these
full copperfin stacks which look a
little
prynt I mean the maybe not quite as
color neutral as the aluminum ones but
if you're going for performance and/or
maybe this guy's well with you from an
aesthetic standpoint also just to point
out these very much seem to be renders
not actual products true so you know
your mileage may vary as far as the
actual finish on the copper fins for
example yeah that's true they could be
like you know lumen or nickel plated or
something like that it might have a
different patina on their patina yeah I
like that word it's just thrown that
word sounds like petunia petunia
different petunia okay this is the
that's the h7 right yeah alright so with
the copper and a white top yeah again
like like you said these are vendors I
don't know if these are the final
finished products I would kind of like
them I prefer the original look over
this but you know again we don't know if
this is the actual final look these
should cool detail these will definitely
cool better that's the whole point of
swapping out the aluminum with the
copper is that copper will have twice
the amount of heat conductivity as the
aluminum you know I mean there's a
reason why all the heat pipes that we
see or most of them anyway for video
cards and CPU coolers alike are made of
copper and it's the closest thing one of
the closest things to the GPU or the CPU
and it conducts heat very well the only
reason they go with aluminum is because
it's a bit cheaper it's lighter weight
and I think that's it is there another
reason to go with aluminum probably not
yeah and I mean it's it's a it's a price
to performance thing yeah so um based on
the picture shown it looks like the h7
the c7 the h5 r1 and the c1 and the m9 a
little cooler will be getting the copper
fin treatment so hopefully these renders
are you know at least that render with
all of the coolers shown hopefully those
will all be available in in C in good ol
see you in Cooper so um yeah I guess
we'll be able to check these out for
sure in in Computex yeah copy Tex
believe otherwise demos are hand yeah
I'm also very curious to see what sort
of you know how many degrees
like that would drop over the the
originals and I don't know and and what
kind of like if there's a premium you
know over the how much more they cost
yeah
they will cost more yeah because the
base cost of a loom of copper versus
aluminum right so I mean I don't know
it'll be interesting to see anyway we'll
do some maybe comparisons to compare
some testing in the future perhaps on
our channels for now we can talk about
the next story which is the asrock AMD x
399 that's right I didn't say X 299 I
said x3 next 499 Kyle that's not even
the thing that is the thing I'm telling
you man this is leaks it happened and
also the the Intel x29 motherboards
these are all being confirmed via and
asrock FTP listing an FTP listing is
basically you know designated for a set
up file it's just a plain text document
that's used by the driver disk in order
to install the files to the system so
this is basically leaked out this is a
little leak a little text file got
leaked from as rocks FTP listing and you
can basically see some some interesting
things about the motherboards in their
database so let's see this is a links at
the as Erick Europe the there's three
Intel x-29 boards 299 boards and a
fatality X 399 board for AMD thread
Ripper again this is something that
we're going to be talking more about on
Paul's 1/2 so this X 399 board still
hasn't been announced it's the first
time we've seen it but it also sort of
confirms that this will be the official
chipset or platform for AMD thread
Ripper and core I nine CPUs the file
shows the x9 x 399 board having 5 10
Gigabit LAN controllers like what is
kind of insane I don't know if that's a
typo but a quanti a 10 gigabit ethernet
lan driver yeah okay yeah so five 10
Gigabit LAN controllers and there's also
they're also displaying the i9 naming
scheme which confirms that the upcoming
I 9 core X series will will exist
you know but up until this point it's
been it's been more like hearsay you
know it's been a lot of rumors and stuff
like we've been calling it I 9 and stuff
but this seems like the like it's
actually validating the the rumors a bit
here with the naming schemes that are
found straight from a board manufacturer
and asrock has also confirmed some rise
in mini-itx boards up until this point
we've only seen the Biostar that resume
texas old news right
yeah apparently I mean got the bow
starboard heck yeah I mean who even
cares about any more than I did my video
on it but uh yeah I guess you know
people still care write articles on you
know that's cool googoo 3d in before goo
3d it bitches know Thank You guru 3d for
this article so the ex 370 gaming ITX AC
which means it has Wi-Fi is built-in
Wi-Fi
well that's useful and a be thrifty be
beat I said with a be thrifty the
kidding me 50 gaming ITX pays a B 353
thrifty yeah I said the a B 50 a be
thrifty instead of 350 okay I just don't
have consolidated a bit but yes that
also you're going to see quite the be
350 chipset the be 350 chipset just be
thrifty be thrifty I like that I'm just
going to use that okay so a a be thrifty
gaming icx AC is also going to have
Wi-Fi probably probably cheaper it's
probably be cheaper than the X 370 just
get the B 351 unless they're different
in some other way than the chipset
because it's kind of pointless to have
an X 370 chipset as I also discussed in
my video on a mini ITX board I really
utilize a lot of great features of X 370
anyway video cards comm also tipped off
were also tipped off to 4x 299 models
from asrock the fatality professional
gaming i9 and the fatality professional
gaming i7 beginning k-6 and the Taichi
board that that's that's all they say
it's just as Taichi
they don't know exactly if that's just
going to be the name or if there's more
to it but um I don't know I feel like
this could have been a sword fight if I
did sort of fire my half of show it
would be you know what do you think
about AMD's naming scheme
with these chipsets really I mean you've
got X 299 from Intel he clearly
announced that first and now AMD's fired
back with X 399 which is you know a
hundred more it's one you know one
series more seemingly over X 299 and it
also sort of cripples Intel from being
able to to call their next generation
chipset X 399 so and they do the same
thing with B 50 BBB 254 Intel and B 350
for AMD I actually confuse that in one
of my videos I was doing a rising build
and I had to be 250 board in the back I
swapped it out later like shit because I
look exactly the same as you know it's
very close so I don't know this this
would have been good sore point is
ideals a smart naming scheme is it is it
genius or is it unoriginal and confusing
no it's it's it's a marketing game of
one-upsmanship and it's one of those
psychological things about how you name
products and how people associate higher
numbers with things being faster and all
that kind of stuff and I don't like it
I actually irritates the crap out of me
because I think the people who are
naming the products are thinking much
more in terms of how can we name this to
juxtapose it versus the competitor yeah
versus how can we name this to just make
it a simple choice you know what product
to buy for customers like right like
come on like yeah the fact that you're
going to have an X 299 chipset
motherboard on Intel side and an X 399
chipset on AMD side and God knows what's
going on with Intel side when it comes
to there they are X 299 stuff in general
I mean we talked about some of the
rumors about that with them having K be
like X and skylake X and the different
core and thread counts and all that kind
of stuff
right and it just it can get extremely
confusing I mean for people like us who
deal with this day in and day out right
it can be very difficult to keep all
these things sort of a line in your head
yeah so say nothing if someone who's
like coming at this for the first time
being like hey I've heard about this PC
gaming thing and I want to build a night
like a cool awesome high-end system yeah
you could get very bogged down in just
the names and stuff it actually reminds
me of
back when AMD was first coming out with
their dual-core processors and Intel had
all their processors like their Pentiums
and everything and until started naming
their processors like 3200 plus and 3800
plus and these numbers that were
supposed to give you an impression of a
frequency that the Intel processors are
running at because the Intel processors
were running at higher frequencies and
the AMD processors but AMD had dual-core
and integrated memory controllers and
several other things that made their
processors faster even at lower
frequencies but they're so fixated on
this advertising of the frequency number
they just started making up numbers for
their processors that seem to indicate a
frequency which is AMD is like it
performs at about this same level of
what the equivalent Intel processor
would perform at at that frequency and I
just got really confusing so yeah I feel
like when I see things like this like
the sort of nomenclature or whatever I
feel like they're not like AMD or Intel
whoever's doing it they're not naming it
this way for us like people who kind of
like will actually read the reviews and
do good do the testing first to
determine which which ones better not
just based on the name right but so
really what this is ain't who this is
aimed at like this sort of nomenclature
is like the you know the very small
percentage of people who are like
building a PC maybe for the first time
who don't know and are looking at two
motherboards and there's one that says
299 and was that one this is 399 yeah
and you know based on whatever
statistics and whatever market research
that they've done says you know you know
four out of five people will choose the
one that has the higher number and so
they're like oh that's we're gonna make
our margins that way or we're gonna have
you know additional sales that you know
in that sense it's just like okay that's
that's great in all I'm glad you're like
catering your entire naming scheme to
like the 5% of people who have no idea
what they're looking at but for the rest
of us it's just a pain in the ass and
it's confusing as hell yeah and it's
like it just I don't know it's it's
knowing that also just seems slightly
disingenuous and yeah that kind of thing
but it's going to keep happening because
you know in a lot of areas it is
proven to work as far as you know what
you name something and what people
perceive I like to think the people who
build computers who get into this though
are a little bit more savvy than that
though
yeah so very true knows but richer all
right all right let's we can skip this
last story because we it's about an hour
now and we still have comments and stuff
to go over donations okay um yeah this
is do it let's show people the story
we're skipping course okay
commander pro rata may I'm lighting and
controller announced watch out NZXT hue
plus you've got a competitor on your
hands that's all we're gonna say yeah
that's it
go read yard okay so what's next
uh we can just talk about some donations
they all who donated if you haven't had
a chance to donate now's your last
chance before this half of the show um
if not then you can always donate on
paul's half but let's start with
sebastian Sebastiaan that's Gisela for
the 20/20 ARS donation is Australian no
that's a argentine - Eddie's window
stayed with us perhaps
alright let's both oh yeah this is right
there so it's green what else yeah
that's recess I did I always been money
before every to come it you know
let's both make our best attempt at
pronouncing the name of that city all
right you go first
Argentina another city
Buenos Aires Buenos Aires no that's
wrong when will say it is with us why do
I sound Italian I don't know
Buenos at Buenos Aires Chinese man
saying it's the engine here aired Aires
Buenos Aires Buenos Aires I was I think
that I think that way don't say there
are the closest s like ER es because I
was like no no God clarify cars iris
Buenos Aires iris iris Buenos Aires
Buenos Aires iris iris I'm sorry
buenos itis see he donated money we
thanked him quietly by butchering even
his cultural name of this beautiful city
that isn't Thank You Sebastian sorry
Sebastian thank you
Brian when five dollars that you're from
good ol USA aren't you stick to trying
to stack my hardware boxes
on the wall like all the tech tubers do
how do I get them to stay oh um you know
very intricate framework constructed
behind each one with hooks yeah I
designed to hold each one it's actually
a suspension system it takes years to to
build and hang it on while mine was an
earthquake hazard for quite a while
that's mostly reason I took it down I
mind still an earthquake and then
granted those all the boxes are empty
but you know they just make a mess if it
ever fell shake his empty boxes yeah um
occasionally I would open one of the
boxes like have it like you know where I
wanted it on the wall stacked and sort
of like open it and then take a
thumbtack and just stick it in the back
wall of the box to the wall
oh there you go just pin it you know any
name and that seemed to work pretty well
I've taken a slightly larger box that's
on the base level and then a box above
it and you just put a piece of tape
across the back of both of them just
keeps the upper box from like tilting
forward oh yeah that's good idea
something like that that's smart that's
the question of actually cave it has a
much better response in the last
question Eric actually moderately use
Eric le for the ten dollars mr. jelly
here hey jelly
I bought Nace's predator and I had a
hard time figuring out the version of
DisplayPort I needed and if I bought the
newest cord if there was backwards
compatibility with older cords I think
you mean a star predator if I'm not
mistaken yeah talking about monitors
here which it seems like you are
it's probably an Acer predator the
version of DisplayPort that you need for
your video card anyway I would think as
DisplayPort 1.4 but the cables I believe
everything after DisplayPort 1.1 or
maybe 1.2 members are all the same yeah
it's the same with the HDMI any HDMI 1.4
cable is fine 4 HDMI 2.0 so by and large
any disappoint just any standard display
port cabling it should work
yeah I think you very much Eric Jacob
the 2 bucks
do you have an old z97 micro ATX or ITX
board I can buy I don't think so
at other either gave mine away or
already sold it perhaps at the fan
native that we did I think the only z97
board I have is in the streaming system
my existing streaming system ah you
can't have it yeah well it's fully TX
anyway so
is geo cashier for the two British pound
good hey guys has the Terry Crews built
it going we're almost done
yep we're working on yeah he's in the
love it way better than the one jaded
for him instead of wait what was Jay's
what what type of deodorant did Jay use
in his Old Spice I know but the specific
variant of Old Spice Oh was it bear
glove yeah it was bear glove we should
do one based on a different flavor no if
you do it we should do a Brooklyn
nine-nine or Brooklyn 199 no Brooklyn
Brooklyn nine-nine I'm aware am i
blanking on I'm aware of the show you're
talking about but I can't correct you if
you're wrong
hey but I think yeah okay I was right if
psychically white why that though
because he's Terry Crews is in it
oh yeah he's this and one of the stars
on the show yes I think Jay at one point
was debating whether they would go Old
Spice or Brooklyn nine-nine and they you
know veered obviously probably goody
with Old Spice because old space like
retweeted them and stuff and I think
they have a larger social media region
oh yeah definitely I mean I think on
Strictly by-the-numbers
marketing and stuff on but yes um let's
see Mathias scooter for the 5c a CHF
remember the heck that is um that cell
wasn't anything that I was talking about
old spice flavors they're delicious
that's why you soon what is it apply the
old spice right so you start good
morning after the keep the Terry
cruiserweight build away from Paul he'll
eat it just do one of the tubes not yeah
all right Kyle restock the bit wit
shirts for fuck's sake you keep
advertising them but why if you can't
buy them I'm sorry didn't realize they
were out I will head up my t-shirt guy
and ensure that they are back in stock
is it all sizes is every size out of
stock I'll check I haven't checked it in
a while international shipping is a pain
in the butt
yes yes it is true we deal with it
occasionally and you don't like it
either
Jeff Dave is $10 Kyle I noticed you do
not use the PWM hub in the silver belt
and do evolve ATX I'm building in this
case now with the stripped z2 7te
explain why or why not to use this hub
Thanks um to be honest I think I don't
know I don't know why I didn't use the
PWM hub um if you have enough I could
have not wanted more granular control
with the software on the motherboard
could been it - yeah I mean if you have
enough plugs in the motherboard just
plug all the fans of the motherboard and
again bypass it yeah that would be a
reason I mean if you plug them all into
the hub and then you have the hub lead
going to your CPU fan hub everything's
going to be based on your CPU
temperature yeah whereas if you have
them plugged into different areas on the
motherboard the motherboard might have
more capability of like well the CPUs
hot run the CPU fans more but not all
the fans in the case right you know keep
keep the external fans which can
sometimes create more noise because
they're more at the outside edges of the
case right um so that could be a reason
fan hubs are really good like in cases
like that for if you have like a large
radio or something like that that you
know for your CPU like let's say you
have a 360 a IO in push-pull and you
have six fans on that sucker then the
fan head like that is really great
because they're all going they're all
working for the CPU temps anyway so it's
like what Paul was saying that just
makes a lot of sense that way but since
I was cooling different areas of the
case and whatnot especially in that
build I opted for the motherboard ports
headers but I think you very much Jeff
another one from Jeff Davis $5.00 damn
autocorrect cost me five bucks not the
strip to Z 270 the a6 tricks but see god
I don't know what you were saying that
just graze right over it extra five
bucks was a waste that's right oh it
won't get put to waste for me right well
sir thank you very much Samuel Allen for
the to NZ XT New Zealand New Zealand
I believe hey guys I'm a Kiwi know who
loves both of your channels I love Kiwis
I love Kiwis - it kind of tart little
black seeds in them my wife's allergic
to him oh really
yeah that's if you're gonna kill Heather
just throw it like lava Kiwi at it and
she'll just chill just like that chilled
you a little just little a convulsion
and this is it will just drop - she's
not pay attention lands on the grand
sir did you just Falls me yeah just the
sight of the Kiwi will erupt her heart
oh it's good to know yep Hey
all right Tom field the - hey guys when
will scrapyard - or skirt or Center to
be I've seen episode - did you watch it
I haven't seen it yet
oh you haven't haven't I have not had a
chance man okay I have not you got it if
you want to watch scrapyard words ahead
of time you you go to Linus tech tips
website and sign up for flow planning
Club I don't know how much it costs or
anything like that or you can wait then
you can watch them early or you can wait
better generally yeah it's got a week
but we have we have some discussion I
think as scrap yard Wars launches
because I think there's going to be four
or five episodes total yeah and we'll
give you guys some feedback as they come
out and definitely definitely some some
words to say I think especially once the
entire thing comes out but yeah I really
think overall you guys are going to
enjoy the episodes as they continue even
the first couple I think have been
really nice and I think it's only gonna
get crazier as they go on yeah so just a
spiral of insanity yes
should be fun come on five dollars no
questions today but I didn't get my gtx
980ti thigh when three four twenty
yoloswag to day that I'm going to
install up to the stream and I'm super
freakin excited we're excited for you
I'm excited that is an excellent card
it's gorgeous
as we just I just did a review on that
one and then Jade did one just before me
damn him thank you gotta I kept turning
away 1080s I felt awkward who are you I
don't know have you no love for
technologies I got I got that I got one
from Asus and one from gigabyte I had a
frame right turned I turned all the
other ones away I know I'm sorry I don't
think I've accepted anymore yes well I
got it I got maybe got one offer as like
oh my god yeah it feels wrong feels
wrong to say no something like that it
doesn't people save up for like months
months and months so much just like
please please take it please - just
bring it wasn't wasn't because I didn't
want them or didn't think we were
getting cards it's just I know how much
time I had between then and this week
and sleeping today and everything and I
didn't want to I didn't want to try to
cram in more
that I could handle totally agree all
right my booth Mike for the five I'm
starting a custom PC building company I
will film the builds for YouTube and
review the products that my customers
request any tips for success maintain
consistency don't be disappointed if
right as you're starting out even for
the first say year or two you don't have
a lot of views yeah you got out you got
to you got to establish sort of a base
of videos that you've put out they're
all quality and then as you keep
consistently posting videos YouTube will
see you as more and more of a relevant
viable youtuber yeah and then as people
see the videos that you post here in the
future they'll have this whole backlog
of videos that they'll be able to see
and be like this is a person who does
lots of good videos there's someone I
should subscribe to yeah so that's
that's really what it's about but don't
don't expect massive success right out
of the gate and don't even aim for it
like if you do a video right out of the
gate that goes viral and gets a bunch of
views and everything you're never going
to surpass that like it's gonna be yeah
yeah sub to beat and also and also get
rid of any semblance of social life you
have now yeah it's also you know either
breakup with your spouse or girlfriend
or at least tell her exactly how things
are going to be which is I give you no
attention from now until five years from
now
and and and just yeah and just don't
talk to anyone so your suggestion from
chat is to have big boobs big catches
can also is the real pretty help in
certain situations or just put them in
your thumbnails that Demyan you don't
have to have them just just some news
your thumbnail beat the crap out of its
out of everyone all right Aaron Wiggins
for the 20 bucks hey Aaron what's up man
owner of oz mugs from west mods one mods
if cell needs wiser was what I don't we
have to disturb the term in this rain
why is it wise what is it wise mods or
waz mods waze waze waze mods or waz mods
you decide I know Aaron let us know and
check pronunciation has been a theme of
this post also this is taking a while
India okay so I'll need sleeved
extensions for his new rig let me know
fuck him up cell so get in contact with
Aaron and
are either on Twitter or yeah he does he
sent us samples actually I think I'm we
didn't send me samples I've got samples
cuz he loves me I never given my address
specific Stewie
well alright Aaron Aaron I'm gonna and
cook it and touch lots of cookies I
think I think Joker's doing a build with
with some of his cables so cool that's
awesome
that'd be sweet we'll see if we can hook
that up if you're willing I'm sure I'm
sure cell would be totally stoked to
have that absolutely and I said we've
got Scott right open for the $5 spatty
Graham here like the edition was
definitely a mistake okay all the
followers of NZXT on Twitter was sure to
flame me a bunch great sure and thanks
well glad what we we pointed that out
and that the rest of the internet did as
well thanks for submitting though
appreciate that yeah uh d'banj on
totally for the 200-some time to look up
what this is yeah just google that right
there not sure what this currency is hi
sir thank you so much for both of your
amazing contents it's an RV Ruby's other
Indian rupees yay
I like rupees I love from a 15 years old
fan from India helped me a lot building
my own PC hope someday you'll come to
India it's 2:04 a.m. get some Wow get
out of sleep dad Deb and John what are
you doing get your get your butt to bed
thank you so much absolutely are you
feel frickin amazed at those people in
India who watch our Channel it's super
cool it just shows the universal appeal
and and unification that the building
computers does just our university
stupidities yeah that too
it breaks all boundaries transcends all
all countries it unites a people alright
Dan Heath $10 we're gonna roll through
these pretty quickly because there's a
lot I came up the good work
love the show thank you very much Dan
love you Ralph Burnett for the 10 bucks
and there was a duck behind my job last
night what kind of a shady place I think
he was trying to buy some quack oh boy
oh boy
jokes aside you to help me build my PC
things alone for the hill videos I was
really wondering where that was going
I'm glad it went somewhat Thank You
Ralph Ghost fun that's a good uh good
one that's good
Monkeyface nine $25 thanks moe comment
thanks Mikey face you're the best
Dave knee is for the five Canadian Nunez
Nunez
any recommendations for a silent mid or
full tower case and cooler AIO
for a risin 1700 system has to support
three three and a half inch hard drives
and two SSDs the tower that you just
built in I just built in the dark base
900 by be quiet really why I do that I
think it's I don't it's about two
hundred plus dollars it's an expensive
case but it is really nice
mm-hmm other than that if you want
something I mean the it's a fractal yeah
define s would be a great option for you
I don't know if that will support three
3.5 inch drives Oh can you fit three on
that on the back of that yeah you can
oh the finest yeah finest yeah you can
okay three three-and-a-half inch yes if
not consider the define our five yeah I
mean if you that's probably what I would
go for if you want something more around
100 hundred dollar range a little bit
more reasonable I would agree um what
else
silent mmm there's so many others I just
I don't know I'm brain farting but yeah
maybe you got one of those
Bobby jr. five dollars can you recommend
an a Oh liquid cooler that's better than
not to a NHD 15 air cooler honestly
that's a really good cooler to get an AI
oh that performs better significantly
better where it's worth the extra money
spending $100 plus I would I would
either get a thick 240 millimeter red or
even preferably at 280 yeah if your case
can afford it because that's already a
really good cooler that's you don't want
to spend too much more you know for just
marginal thermal performance yeah the
thing with comparing an AIO to a knock
to NHD 15 is a iOS have they take a
while to heat up so even if you if you
test an i/o right out of the gates the
performance might seem better than an
aged NHD 15 if you let it run for an
hour then the performance can kind of
equalizes which is kind of interesting
it that's why I went with an NHD 15 is
because you don't have the potentials of
a pump in a all-in-one liquid cooler
making noise and you're failing yeah but
yeah it's hard to do I mean that's why
that's why Nachtwey gets away with
selling the NHD 15 for 90 bucks
yep which is the same price as a lot of
you know pretty decent 240 Reds rad a
iOS but yeah I mean the higher end ones
will do equivalent or better i like the
recently the NZXT kraken x 62 if you
like doing a little bit of color
customization as well things looks
pretty nice right or you can always
stick with something more basic like the
new freckle Celsius it's pretty decent I
have the Celsius yeah yeah Chad Celsius
s 24 there's so many options with liquid
coolers I really are but thank you very
much Bob a energy for everyone energy oh
I don't even get that was like an ERG
move nerd nerd for everyone I have an FX
95 98 and r9 295x2 should I upgrade to
arise in 1600 first or upgrade to a GTX
1080 hmm um go doctor to a GTX Kenny
without CPU yeah
I'd say great CP upgrades ship you first
yeah yep cuz it's 295x2 I mean at least
in games that are crossfire that are can
leverage crossfire is still a very
powerful card yeah I actually got Luke F
not to be confused with blue cliff
refresh the Prophet $5 when I get a Vega
should I sell my r9 or a migrate it to
my nest for handbrake and Cody would
just be cool not Luke Clifford even said
number four oh nice we saw so same
language um honestly I would sell let's
see your r9 no your r9 what your r9 nano
I mean any radio and I earn are now nine
GPU um if you if you could use it for
hand breaking coding for for an SFA you
said of it then dinner yeah it depends
what's more valuable the money that
you're gonna make off of that card or
the functionality of having that ability
to encode you know you can also like you
can decide put it in your Nass and try
it and see how it works and then see if
it makes sense to you that's what I do
yep thanks Luke PC wizard for the five
dollars Canadian keep up the great work
guys thank you thank you we will we'll
try Jordan Davis Kevin dill for the five
doing distributed network architecture
and operating systems in the UK please
send help keep me sane guys and keep up
good work well good luck on that man
yeah on your own t-shirt I do
I don't know we I don't know that I
don't know how to do distributed network
architecture and operating systems you
too
I mean I have a vague idea of how of how
it's done
Vega I've talked to some IT people they
kind of time have a vague idea okay
James a catch 21 euros sub $200 buck CPU
high from Ireland girl Rison yeah right
now if the resin 1500 on below 209 can
be 100 X can you get how much is the
1600 oh yeah 1600 risin eels this might
feel a little bit more expensive I think
it's what 220 maybe that is 292 220 if
you can stretch shave 20 bucks I'd say
get a 1600 because you're going to get
six cores and twelve threads if not 1500
X you can overclock it and you'll run
circles around what Intel can offer for
that price
yep unless all you're doing is gaming if
all you're ever gonna do is gaming this
is going down there's 7600 K or 7500 or
something back all right okay and then
last one Nathan fetch five dollars Lexie
thanks for making my dad's Twitter blow
up by commenting on the video of me
taking off the plastic on my new piece
oh that's from Lexie yeah she's like yes
your career cute yeah that was adore
super adorable I showed that video to my
mom when we were fishing in Hawaii and
she just like kept watching and she's
like oh like for five minutes and then
we'll like mom it's like a five-second
videoclip that's just on Lou but it
repeats and it repeats and my mom like
literally watched the same loop for like
takes a while better the diminishing
marginal utility
very cute kid you got there Nate heard
every all right there's one one one more
that just came in they're still in chat
okay Oleg for this is 200 rubles are you
ease are you beat I don't know what
that's from how can I make static
pressure fans run slower them the
slowest option in UEFI makes them run
not slow enough and they're kind of loud
in the end greetings from Russia hold on
can't you put a limiter on them and you
a resistor sorry limiter listen to me
yeah put a put a fan resistor on there
it'll actually decrease the amount of
voltage going to the fan and will lower
the RP minimum rpm of said fan there it
is right there they they come in
different varieties like this but it's
basically just a small extension with
the resistor in the middle the thing you
can run into when using these though is
if your fan doesn't have enough voltage
running to it to start it rotating then
that's a problem in some situations I've
had fans before that I wanted to run
really quiet and I remember one
situation at least where I could go in
like when I turned the computer on I
would kick started with my finger and
then it would be fine
yeah but it wouldn't start spinning yep
it would just kind of sit there and go
like that needs a bit more momentum for
that initial kick off but that's what
you need
alright let's let's end your half all
right um Johnson's dammit Johnson we
only got a few ok here
Dustin Thank You Johnson - you have a
finger of a CPU cooler shirt in Heather
double Josh and Dustin thank you so much
for you also got the deer insertion for
sure Mitchell for peanut but red Lynch
charge of the bit with Church so the bit
would shirts are in stock there you go
apparently the high just different ideas
different size Mitchell gets a double
Jasin also got the thumbs gesture for me
Thanksgiving at Matthias that's a cool
name
Matthias awesome it's a double Johnson
