channel today I am joined by Paul of
Paul's hardware my good friend and
colleague to do this sort of really fun
collaboration build that we're doing
it's a two-part series actually part one
of course is what you're watching right
now and afterwards you can head over to
Paul's channel I'll put a link of the
description cards annotations all that
but what we're essentially doing today
is we are doing sort of a charity or a
donation build for our good friend and
twitch moderator cell processing hotel
yes his name is Nick and he has been a
really dedicated moderator and just
friend to us via the internet we've
actually met him in person one or two
times and he's just a really great
individual he helps us a lot with our
twitch streams for awesome hardware and
even on our live streams on YouTube on a
regular basis he's been a really good
pal we game with him frequently and we
just wanted to give back and say thanks
by building him a pretty sweet rig he
already does have a PC of his own which
I believe is pretty decent it's in
relatively good condition I believe this
one though might be a little bit better
and we're Platinum's words Kyle sells
computer is an abomination yet you're
horrible of course any deserve something
much much much better so that's what
we're going to be building for him today
and obviously it's Kyle Kyle are
dimensions just as a huge thank you Tim
for being so dedicated if you guys are
familiar with me and Kyle you know we do
a live show every Tuesday and so has
been our moderator for like a couple
years now super consistent and we'd like
we don't pay him a dime but he's always
there and he's always doing a great job
so thank you so and and I hope this
computer is a good way of saying thank
you yeah it I hope it is I don't know
any better way to say thanks than to
build someone here because all the way
we know it really is well that's love
yes it comes from the heart for sure
so I guess should we just go over some
of the parts that we're using that's a
good idea okay cool alright guys so on
that note Paul and I have kind of joined
forces here to contribute half of the
hardware on either side so we're just
going to take turns talking about each
of the parts that we contributed for
this build that is true so I'm going to
start off here with the CPU and we're
going of course the rides and build
because the rides and CTS are often this
actually is the Rison 7 1700 X that came
directly from AMD and
so not only is it our 1700 X which you
can only tell by looking beside actually
right there but it's it's awesome and
it's one of the original 1700 X's which
is probably means it's a limited time
like you can never never have another
1700 X like that one one of them kind
yes
and then for memory that we're pairing
with the 1700 X we've got a ddr4 kit
this is a 16 gigabyte kit 2 by 8 gig
sticks of the vengeance lpx from good
old Corsair they are rated at 3200
megahertz which is obviously good for
Rison since it does benefit quite
significantly significantly from higher
frequencies in their ddr4 parings and
the catch latency on that Paul II can't
really see it from here so 1618 1836 all
right cool now not too bad for 3300 at
all definitely not too bad and the dyes
on those should be pretty good as well
we should have some pretty solid
compatibility with Rison at this point
with all the BIOS updates that have
surfaced but yeah it should be a pretty
good kit excellent for our motherboard
and this was part of the reason CAD went
with white memory we have the Auris ax
370 gaming 5 from gigabyte so this is
sort of a middle-of-the-road X 370 board
but it has very good overclocking
actually the V RMS on this board are the
exact same V RMS as you get on the
gaming seven so yeah you got MDOT to
support all of the fancy stuff and for
that you get with the horizon and you
even get like RGB got LEDs because we
know cell loves let's RGB LED to develop
those all I cares about fit and we've
got a 240 gig OC z TL 100 this is
Toshiba ocz of course I think the the
SSD is also white so it should be
matching with the rest of the rig pretty
nicely with the mobo accents and whatnot
and let's see I don't need to know
exactly which controllers on this SSD it
just sort of grabbed it had it lying
around but it is say 2 SATA 3 no nvme
here but it should be pretty good for
sales needs again like Paul said there
is intent to slide on the mobo so he
could always upgrade in the future or
expand his storage and yeah that's
pretty much all I got to say with that
going to be a good SSD alright next we
have let's do the case this is the
mastercase pro 6 I've already built in
this case once it is very solid it is
very well built it's got a nice side
panel window on it and everything
actually a big part of the reason why I
chose this case is because of the
packaging to the actual
stuff that's in there we'll show you in
just a minute is absolutely insane as
far as how this case is packed and since
we got a ship it to sell and it's going
to be rough handled and shipping we
wanted to make sure it's going to get to
them okay so well should you get that in
just a second other than that it's a
really nice case though to built like a
tank and it's got a couple fans in there
that stay nice and quiet you said rough
handled I didn't well next up we've got
the graphics card this is a power color
red devil golden sample what so this is
a specifically dialing in some some
higher overclocks than the original Red
Devil this is the rx 580 of course from
AMD which is featuring more refined 14
nanometer LPP package and whatnot so
should have a little bit more higher
performance per watt than the RX 480
not terribly much more performance
in-game but it is a very fantastic card
I've done a review on the Nan Goldin
sample and that was already a blazing
fast GPU for 1440p gaming so the other
Red Devils that we've seen in the past
from power color have actually featured
triple fan designs this one only has two
but they are larger at a hundred
millimeters which should help for better
cooling and and lower noise so overall
it should also have a bit more Headroom
for overclocking if you know if cell
knows how to overclock or something like
that I don't know if he knows much about
the piece and I think part of the reason
that we will with the 580 is the style
pointed out yet cell has a free sync
panel thank you for money to call which
obviously would be kind of a bummer if
we got him an Nvidia card wouldn't be
able to take advantage of that so I
don't know if this is not fast enough
for his needs which I'm sure it will be
he could always you know add in the
second 580 or even wait out for her Vega
sell this back to me if I you know
whatever and then just buy a faster
graphics card if you're finding a profit
on this ultimately no I didn't say that
that's the goal I didn't say that okay
etcetera
now the power supply situation is one of
I want I don't know for some reason the
word butterface comes to mind but this
is an insect 1200 watt high current pro
power supply can't get these anymore
you can't buy a retail but it is 80 plus
gold rated and it is actually a DC power
supply it's also one of the power
supplies it has a fan on the ends rather
than on the bottom of the top or bottom
or top and yeah it's really nice it as
far as the power it's not the prettiest
winnig on
the cables we just some ketchup and
mustard going on so basically we didn't
want to give sell a computer that he's
just never going to touch again sell
loves to build computers and thinker
with them just as we do so this is maybe
potential upgrade opportunity in the
future also we didn't want to give him
something he could just immediately
submit to pimp my PC and like it get a
bunch of using Oz over we need something
to give him a hard time about so self or
not you've got ketchup and mustard to
deal with but you know what it's still
going to work and and part of it matches
the video card oh yeah good the goal
silver lining so the goal down the red
hey hey yeah hey just got to find
something to do with the purple gray and
orange and you know flawless just all
the colors of the rainbow and ass let's
start pre assembling and the unboxing
defying and all of those things I think
there's a fantastic line of hardware
that we have here Paul although what are
we going to do about the operating
system uh well I wasn't just that was a
tie yeah I'm sure self can handle it
himself
go figure yeah you can get Windows 10
for 20 bucks Rome 30 bucks now so I've
heard check out the card in my look at
the video covers but you're ridiculous
this thing what it comes in a bag it's
good I've never seen a case that came in
a bag of the bag so once you once you
build your system you can use this bag
to the do shopping with like in
California you can't use plastic bags
anymore or you got to bring your own non
disposable bags I'm gonna go to the
store and buy an orange and bring this
bag let's do them I'll get my own good
thing so not only to have this outer bag
really really thick grey foam pieces it
also had scraps it had those shipping
like zip straps around it as well when
it first arrived so I wasn't expecting
like a custom water cold system inside
of this given the packaging I think
that's I the idea that coolermaster
wants to make sure it's a system
integrator biases just Jake in original
back yeah they don't have to worry about
doing anything special for the packaging
so I'll thoughtful
everyday
but I'm beautiful listen as will pop-up
panels you know this pop up and pop down
and sometimes yeah they're a fun cool
alright let's prep the motherboard I
suppose prep that mobo coming to me CPU
come to me now you have already this is
a CPU that you've already kind of used a
little bit just for reviewing and stuff
right for testing yeah just did some
really basic testing you know it works
oh that's good oh yeah and it's the 1700
X it is it is objectively better than
like the 1,700 1,700 just in that it's
going to run at a higher frequency and
he's right out of the gate it's got a
higher TDP but honestly like if you if
you overclock a 1600 you've pretty much
destroyed the I mean if here we'll talk
to 1700 you pretty much destroy the 1700
TDP but yeah 1700 X I mean part of the
reason I'm okay giving it up is because
it's not a chip that I would just say
hey go and buy this I would say buy the
1700 and overclock it but if someone
gives it to you for free but yeah well
hell yeah that's a great processor oh
cows demonstrating the might be able to
get another euro insertion for socket
they might might be able to get like an
additional hundred megahertz out of this
guy around 1700 yeah so it should be
able to hit three nine four maybe for
one depend on voltage and everything how
about that memory I'm kind of curious to
see other memories going to match to it
well I don't know call white on white
and black I think it's going to match
quite nicely
so here's always been the static trick I
remember back in the day a new egg this
really does feel like an old-school new
egg build right now it does but I
remember like how I was telling you
about like RGB like when I was building
my nose like oh I want to have like
sleep cables and an RGB lighting and you
were all functioning at that point I
never liked hair why the hell would you
even spend money on that stuff I hadn't
transition Andrea and I feel like I like
you also rubbed off on me because I was
all about the the form and no function
and now we're kind of a hybrid beast of
both worlds may I also say just how nice
it is to have one other person here as a
build is being done here in my garage
often doing it myself yeah it's just
it's just so much more time-consuming
keep setting up all the shafts and all
that said that looks nice that is
beautiful
smokin this memory and this motherboard
are made for each other need ok actually
do you like this card a lot I like the
form factor or the size I should say
it's not terribly long and I know cell
does like small form-factor builds he's
quite partial to them so in the future
if you ever did want to repurpose this
card you could it fits in a lot of small
form-factor cases and it's quite
powerful for the size as you're about to
see again still manages to fit a pair of
100 millimeter fans on there what's the
main difference between the nan goldin
sample and this one is it just
overclocked like it's it's overclocked
higher it actually does have a beefier
cooler on it ok so thermal should be a
bit improved you get 116 and 118 PCIe
connector it's also nice that it does
come with a backplate and hopefully
hopefully cells not super-religious
because there have been other than a bit
of controversy on 10000 colours branding
yep well they certainly aren't targeting
the more religious and it's okay for you
to be able I'm sure cell will forgive
them that's a solid card though yeah
it's pretty and so I think it looks
looking like we're going to have sort of
a black white and red theme system here
actually I personally like a black white
red and blue there are some blue LEDs on
the case right I believe there's a blue
LED fan at the back there's a blue LED
sensor back and I'm not sure what we
should do with that though we should
maybe see what it looks like okay but we
potentially could swap it out to okay
because the only thing is I remember
giving people crap on pin my PC for
having like red and black or red and
blue class you like I would never do
that it looks like a police car it's
patriotic but it is patriotic do you
what do you want me to hate my country
how many people dos it smells very
patriotic alright so let's move on to
the SSD we'll take this out really quick
so maybe we should leave the blue LEDs
in because it matches the blue accents
on the drive there possibly I don't know
man so many options all right we're
coming down it's a very valuable very
crucial part of this build which is of
course the penalty
defecation always crucial always
controversial I'm going to do via the
old-school grain of rice method or the
pay method you like saying P let's do a
little bit of a bit of a turn that was
like that was a nice I like the form
there
yeah it's a little spiral it's all I
call the turd where the turd method is
always comparing method yep
blood just camera gets really good macro
shot is good i Kyle I think that's some
very nice sterile paste application you
get you got going on there
I thank you all right I think it's time
for the cooler go ahead and swipe on
over and oh and drop that bad lay on
there dude
I I forgot to tell you sell hates stock
coolers like I know this is a pretty
decent rate stealth here but he's he's
going to be livid if we put this in his
system are you sure like that we've used
the Wraith cooler than just a okay
no you'll understand man one time a guy
tossed a stock cooler to me and sell
jumped in front of it like he was taking
a bullet it was nuts
seriously dude how do you think he's
racked up all those domestic violence
charges actually I think I've heard
those stories - like I heard cells mom
built in the computer with the stock
heatsink fan was dude one time I saw him
grab a guy's balls just for holding one
of these things granted I've seen him
grab the guy's balls for no reason at
all but it was still really disturbing
I heard syllables an obstacle course out
of old heatsink fans and he makes
neighborhood kids run through it and it
chops into little pieces of meat then he
needs oh god that's disgusting
Jesus oh god okay what kind of a fetish
smell has for aftermarket CPU cores I am
NOT going to let it ruin this project
get your all together pull
everything we're going to get through
the sermon we're gonna make some buzz no
I know
at least the dogs are here to comfort us
