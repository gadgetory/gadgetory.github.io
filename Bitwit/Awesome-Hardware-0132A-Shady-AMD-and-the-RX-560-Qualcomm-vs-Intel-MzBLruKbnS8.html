Paul's Hardware yours is what is yours
now bit wit Kai
bit wit Kai someone took bit with Kyle
already because I didn't
time douchebags dumb sucks that's okay
my family calls me if we you know we
should have done was asked the audience
things did yes getting posted in chat
yet I don't share cell did that hi cell
and thanks for being here yeah so I
don't think so but that's okay I
wouldn't expect him to because we hadn't
really started talking about it yet but
okay go ahead and answer the first
survey that we but Paul's thrown into
chat I just posted it did you post it in
both I can post it in the other one oh
wait no I can't I'm not pals first
question not all of you out there in
order to ask the audience this is how
many viewers are how many of you are
plagued with ketchup and mustard cables
in their system in your system how many
of you have ketchup and mustard whereas
now we're asking you to be honest be
honest if you have it you know say you
do if you don't say you don't don't beat
around the bush here because it's
because that otherwise is all cheap in
our our answers
because we're actually trying to
legitimately guess what you guys have so
Paul what do you think ketchup and
mustard kills from those of you who are
new or who aren't familiar ketchup and
mustard refers to the sort of stock
cables that you get with a lot of sort
of entry-level power supplies that
actually have the red and yellow wires
that don't look all that great you guys
probably have seen them a million times
so you're familiar with it but we tend
to call a touch of mustard just because
it's yellow yellow and red and who likes
ketchup and mustard in their build
anyway so there's there's a perfect
example Paul has just brought one up I
tried and then that it forward us to an
antique article this is where it's there
everywhere this picture courtesy of an
antic that's the Lego series ketchup and
mustard right there it's like do you
want some fries with that whoa Nelly
yeah no kidding how about a hot dog
throw a hot dog at your power supply
right now that would really complete the
picture wouldn't it alright Paul so it's
it I think it's not a door you got a bet
the percentage right but the percentage
as always it's got to be at least the
poles broken the pole is broken
that's what Chad say what according to
youtube chat I didn't post it you know
Chad looks perfectly fine here maybe
they just literally just quit
I'm not I'm not sure I'm gonna repost it
in check or maybe Katz is trolling some
oh oh God are you serious it's
making me log in the second time you
kidding me
just don't like that Wow with Facebook
Oh what I hate I hate sites that ask you
to log in with Facebook
cuz I don't use Facebook oh yeah
Facebook is like why can't I just log in
without any social media site so the
point the point we're trying to get at
here stupid what what was the point you
were trying to get at we're trying to
guess how many of them have ketchup and
mustard alright so to shut
percentage-wise right percentage alright
I'll go first okay 42% 42% yep
42% oddly specific it makes me think
that you know something that's dead-on
that's dead-on
it makes me think you're treating some
hair there's no possible way it's not
42% ah I are you able to paste the link
into cells I liked it I clicked it in
YouTube chat and it led to this correct
page just cell in chat right now people
might be clicking wrong they might be
using the wrong like when you click if
your left clicking Oh little Pacific
action and if you don't do it properly
you might not take a little known fact
about using the computer
Celie oh if that or that our people were
trolling like honestly I click wait why
are you still saying this click tit see
I just clicked it and it did that yeah
see I know it's fine maybe maybe the 404
people in chat not found or honest
people aren't found yeah are you people
with integrity where for 404 Liars in
chat are found
that's what
that's what I found found it
what now alright I'm reap I'm posting
the link what are you sure it's fine are
we gonna are you gonna are you there
they all shut up now I feel like you're
trying to change the subject because my
my guess was so accurate and so dead-on
I'm so you're about to lose okay but
obviously there's a lot at stake here
alright I haven't said what's at stake
alright alright 42% I'm gonna say I
think it's less than that I think I know
the people who watch our show I'm gonna
say 33 33 33 % 33 percent I think
exactly a third of our audience okay has
ketchup and mustard in their system
alright so I think a third is so before
we see before we see we need to remember
those numbers by the way 42 which you're
probably three probably not but before
we do that let's let's take the first a
sneak peek at the next question which
I'm pasting in the chat right now
the twitch chat i pasted it into Tolkien
I'll handle YouTube so everyone everyone
get a head start on this one which title
deserves the game of the year in 2017
obviously Kyle has listed only the
possible options there are no other good
games besides these five well these are
the the big nominees these the actual
these are the in actual nominees for
game of these and this is because there
is I think it was what we talked about
this player on owns battlegrounds is
still in beta is still in early access
it's not really a fully developed game
and so people were like even be
nominated but it is still nominated so
Super Mario Odyssey basic nominee
undergoing the very very number one
number one video game on Black Friday
that was for sales yeah yeah but they're
facing that that lawsuit they are yeah
that's so what being fun is the IP
they're fun police is Homer they're
being sued by Homer Homer Simpson yeah
oh no Simpsons type thing destiny
to has been widely has been
well-received yeah
that might be and it's on course it's on
PC as well and then of course Legend of
Zelda breath of the wild controversy
there being that they were not able to
add its twice as people expected the
therapy to they can choose it they can
make the option cuphead no I've never
heard of it it's a 2d side-scroller I
think actually I have heard of it and
I've heard it's pretty addictive and fun
yeah but let's see what people think
about the ketchup and mustard syndrome
are you a fan of it or not was what we
asked you yeah no we didn't we asked if
you actually have that in your computer
yep I said 69% of people know you did
not stop making up your favorite number
are you getting all kinds ending your
favorite number no because your love
your stuff I think so so nice at 42%
Kyle said you did 30 33 % yeah survey
says you guys said oh wow I was pretty
damn close so you were closest with 30%
30% all right well then and they have
now it just jump it just changed to 69%
well which is what I thought no that's
not what you originally that's what you
said afterwards that's true you're lying
we have we have it on camera stop laying
there are our fans this is so much fun
hey let's move on to our it's good to
know though it's good to know that the
vast majority of our fans have have
solid tastes are willing to you know
spend a little bit extra on the finer
things in life because really that's
what that's what life's all about
that's what our shows all about sees a
little moments that we share with each
other it's the small small things it's
the little things
I'm glad that there's most of you aren't
subjected to that that's okay we need to
render our opinions on which title
deserves game of the year 2017 okay
I I went first last time so I believe
you have all right honors I'm gonna say
that our I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say that you guys think Legend of
Zelda breath of the wild should be game
of the year because
even though it is a console game a
console exclusive I feel like Nintendo
gets sort of a pass when it comes to the
whole PC versus console war and really
pcs are really just kind of the only
real rivals they have our PlayStation
and an xbox because Nintendo sort of in
its own on its own Island right it's
like it's like your grandma plays
Nintendo Wii or whatever it is the
switch and and I've also seen a lot of
you on Twitter I took a poll and said
what do you guys bring with you on trips
if not your smartphone besides your
smartphone what's the one piece of tech
you bring with you when you travel and
an overwhelming number of you guys said
your Nintendo switch which I was not
expecting and so it cued me in to be
like okay this is this is something that
goes hand in hand with pcmr the PC
master-race switch and this is the
biggest game of the platform this year
so which is that's my vote switches get
stitches switches are bitches get
switches all right I'm gonna go for
player knowns battlegrounds of course
you are I am traitor it's this is a
callous how could you I'm purely going
for the win area I'm Telus Lee only
looking at the numbers I'm like like if
I has a stock broker coming in and
looking at the gaming market and I had
no idea and I'd never played again a
game before I'm going with this purely
based on the numbers right now
dominating steam so many players people
getting into building computers because
player nones battle guns who cares if
it's in beta it's game people playing
it's valid and you think our viewers
feel the same way I think that's what
I'm banking on ok all right well before
we look at the results there and see how
wrong Paul truly is let's go ahead and
ask you guys our third question of the
night which is what is your preferred
content streaming service oh and I need
more like TV shows and movies rather
than like you know twitch streamers and
stuff like that so our options here are
Hulu sling TV YouTube TV Netflix leaving
Twitter big ones we don't want we don't
want an obvious winner in there like
well of course yeah any I'm not talking
about there's a specific type of content
it's more like premium premium content
more than content creators right
I'll go ahead and post that into chat if
SEL hasn't already
so let's posted it into twitch chat
thank you very much self for doing that
alright so it's in a youtube chat now
too so you guys go ahead and answer
honestly there what's your favorite
content content streaming service and
then we're gonna go ahead and figure out
what you guys thought or think game of
the year 2000 be also I mean but just
before we show the results here we
should clarify this world's exclusive
for game of the year telling you guys
who the winner is gonna be like this you
guys are hearing it first right here
pretty much cuz obviously yeah cuz
whatever the winners this small straw
poll is yeah this is a microcosm of the
gaming community as a whole
yeah watching our show I mean it's only
the important gamers exactly we probably
have all the members of the game of the
year board all the board members
watching us right now exactly so you
guys heard it here first
again my horse was was pub G Kyle
foolishly chose that Legend of Zelda
we'll see who have fool cervezas real
fool oh oh oh my god % Wow 3 Purcell can
you believe it in Tendo coming through
strong with the win here ah well I mean
I mean that I'll give it to him Nintendo
I I enjoy I like I they do they do
stupid stuff sometimes and you tend to
forget it because they have such such
classic legendary titles such as the
Zelda series and everything yeah I mean
I haven't even played breath of the wild
so I mean either you have an either you
pay no we never haven't played it well
just okay everyone we know who games on
PC that's also probably why I chose pop
Jesus you don't think one of these games
I like Steve Steve's the biggest PC
gamer I know personalized massive piece
and he is the first thing like when we
were going to see yes I think it was CES
last year he was in the car with us I
think right and he had his Nintendo
switch yeah
he's a hero check this out and his
breath of the wild I was like ok and
then my brother-in-law
Kyle 2.0 he he's huge he's a huge
advocate of the switch and he he also
was very black Kyle actually has a
biological copy
no clone of him
I mean call them kudzu gluey no very
inaccurate notices his brother-in-law
yeah go on this is complicated I guess
sure um so yeah I mean I'm not terribly
surprised but it's kind of cool that's
you know with our core demographic being
a bunch of PC gamers that a console
exclusive even in their eyes deserves
the title of game of the year I'm
impressed that's pretty cool brand cool
guys pretty way to go Nintendo um and by
the way you owe us two big drinks so far
you could save them for the end since
you're already queued down and you're
about to be three with this last
question here preferred content
streaming service what do you think Paul
alright you get to go first on this one
I gotta appreciate that there is some
competition in the marketplace but Hulu
in sling TV are out this is definitely a
choice between YouTube Netflix and
Amazon you specifically put YouTube TV
and in my mind I feel like not quite as
many people have picked that up yet so
even though YouTube's insanely popular
and that is what we both like you know
make videos for for a living I'm gonna
go with Netflix I just feel like it has
the widest install base right now like
there's there's there's more people with
a Netflix subscription that have
subscriptions to YouTube TV or Amazon
although Amazon's catching up and you
know people might have incidental and
Amazon subscriptions
elsewise for prime or something but
don't even use the video streaming
service for example but for this survey
here I'm gonna go I'm gonna go with
Netflix
well that was clearly in the cop-out
answer and you totally fell for that
yep so I'm gonna have to go from the
second second big player in this
situation which is Amazon they've been
hitting it pretty hard with all the
there what Yuma call it okay you put
YouTube TV rather than just YouTube was
that where you pay just no pay you what
what is it to do anything to TV have
some sort of I told you underground like
marketing scheme going on right now
where they're like hey we're gonna do
some shady business to publicize this
new service I have no IDE no basis where
are you getting this a horrible
accusation of it no idea I just had a
youtube TV thing little
like hey you want to try YouTube TV I I
signed up for it I got it yeah is it
just to watch like it's the same as
YouTube bread or what no no it's
actually live TV it was like a three
minute delay or something like that but
that's actually from live TV
oh so you could like watch the news like
cuz I feel like I've been way out of the
loop lately like on the news like man
there's frickin five fires you know
there's like five or six major fires in
Southern California right now I'm just
now hearing about it like earlier today
yesterday because I don't watch the news
because I don't actually have cable TV
so I'm getting frickin YouTube TV so we
can watch the news boring like that
and also occasionally catch like you
know the Walking Dead or something like
that which is on AMC and be able to
watch that the the second that it
actually airs as opposed to because you
can watch a lot of shows on Amazon but
they they come out a day after they air
on TV so I'm like I want to wait today I
don't want to wait today now a good
option for cord cutters yeah it
definitely is it would be if you
actually were getting paid for this
right oh my god I should because I feel
like I'm that weird a lot this is the
best type of disappointing that I'm not
gonna bliss atif or something but yeah
I'm not good that's that's that's mildly
interesting yeah
check out those free trial and stuff but
alright we need to we need to move on I
think the first segment has taken quite
a while so she flicks I said Amazon yes
indeed let's let's Wow a crushing blow
yes a crushing I feel like that should
make me win over all because like give
you one like right percentage that I you
know for this compare it like if you
didn't we did that we did you know
average you know percentages math okay
all right fine well I'll take you take
two medium sips I'll take a very very
large one in fact I can probably kill
the rest of this I'll kill the rest I'm
gonna try to take one big-ass goal you
know getting do this the rest of this
beer in one gulp
probably not I'm gonna try though Cheers
you're not a wait why you
gonna set that precedent
well then we need more beer hoorah
all right I can get more beer um why
don't you go ahead and introduce our
next segment okay okay sorry sorry sorry
for what yes I would like beer Oh what
there's they're all in pairs so just
grab a pair yeah and they're set up that
way
sorry about the high-pitched barking
everyone also I'm burping all no Cal
forgets that like if you make any sudden
movements nori nori is a herding dog so
she freaks out and tries to check you
all right so we're doing the next
segment which is put my PC the name of
this segment of course thanks ma'am
handed down to us by the one and only
late met filly God rest his soul he's
still alive nobody freaked out alive you
know I'm terrible I mean I would assume
eNOS I shouldn't spread rumors about
Matt Matt Phillies I mean I haven't
actually seen the video from in a while
he might be dead
look nobody tweet Matt Philly right now
and make sure he's alive because we're
positive that that's fun that he's fine
yep point being that my PC is where you
guys send Kyle pictures me too I'm
usually tagged in them and I look at
them too pictures of your computers and
then we look at them and critique them
with and I mainly first then Excel
though I feel like we do we do mmm I
feel like we give sound advice on your
segment right yeah I feel like we're
we're honest about it yeah you know
let's but the idea is to make things
prettier if possible so it's pimped my
PC our first submission here is from
lathe Salman doc lathe on
Twitter with an i7 the 6700 K based
system
the NZ NZXT kraken x61 gigabyte z170 MX
gaming 5 motherboard 32 kraken a patriot
viper viper memory that's a quite a got
it got a lot of memory in their dual GG
x 10 70's an SLI air-cooled wait what
oh please gotten NZXT aftermarket so
it's got a water cooler on the top one
and an air cooler on the bottom one
alright interesting i I can appreciate
that the top
I think I'm not practically parties is
usually the hotter one yeah that's a lot
configuration so that NZXT s340 case
kingston 240 SSD sandisk for donating i
guess SDM se gates 4 terabyte hard drive
what's holding up the is this a
permanent marker it looks like one of
those yeah it looks like it looks like
just like a felt marker oh sorry sorry
guys it wasn't centered there maybe one
of them yeah like it looks like yeah
like one of them you got to shake it up
and then it'll write on anything or
something like that that's the weird
signature marker pen things I mean it
matches it black white red silver and it
looks like it's holding I mean how bad
is that sag I mean yeah is it to the
point where not even the card beneath it
can prop it up I mean sometimes when you
put these aftermarket coolers on them
because they put so much torque on the
PCB in specific places it'll curve the
PCB and kind of exaggerate the the SAG
so that would be my guess as to why you
put that in there plus there's an active
fan on this here so and the SLI
configuration since it's only a he's got
two slots and then two more slots that
there's there's no gap between these two
cards so there's potentially with a lot
of sag the potential for it to you know
actually have the fan hit the the Lord
card so maybe that's why it's there yeah
just in fact definitely definite ding
here for the ketchup and mustard cables
the the bare multi color 24 pin you were
clearly one of our 30% leave this I mean
everything else looks very
color-coordinated so that you you could
get away with like it's fairly
inexpensive fifteen or twenty dollar
24-pin extension and kind of clean that
up a bit and I think everything else use
while you're at it and then I think
everything else is looking pretty nice I
mean the pen what do you think about the
pen is the pen it's a I mean it doesn't
look terrible I've seen much worse when
it comes to in regards to like props or
crutches for GPUs yeah but at the other
day it's still a pen it's doing your
computer so there are things that exist
to help you with that situation no no no
it's not okay
thanks Paul and Paul lose the bottle
opener yeah yeah of course you should
buy five of now um I yeah but the thing
is like I know that they have the
brackets but the bracket that goes
underneath your GPU to prop it up that
would interfere you would be able to do
that because you have a GPU underneath
it even a second GPU yeah um but there
should be sort of like uh I don't know
like sort of a what do you call it the
hell is Hiro doing just like a crutch to
go underneath your your graphics card do
you know any good brands for for like
and then PC tech for for that type for
that type of yeah for that type them
yeah
stop it what's he doing here oh you're
so noisy
he's aggressively licking his par or
something like that unless he's not as
balls unusual yeah it's very chomping on
his ball sack beef alright it's what's
for dinner
thank you late summoned for your
submission thanks i I don't know if
we've helped you but let's move on
what's up Wiggles next with the NZXT
elite case see sonic G 650 watt semi
modular power supply nice districts
gaming FB 350 motherboard horizon 1600
CPU a cry reg age seven CPU cooler 16
gigs of g.skill ripjaws five ddr4 3000
nice combination with horizon for gig
gtx970 maybe 3.5 if you wanna amend that
now just you turn 50 gig 840 Evo SSD 2
terabyte tachi 7200 black or colored
cable extensions is what he's asking
1070 TI or vegas 56 as well
purple obviously we're going to so he's
anticipating our suggested upgrades here
which obviously would have been upgrade
that 970 cuz yeah that's just that
that's the part in this system that's
that's looking like it could use an
upgrade and of course your your power
supply cables go into everything else
yeah are and he's asking colored for
cable are colored or what was it the
question colored or black extender black
extensions I think for this system you
either go black or white cuz you have
some white accents on your motherboard
and you have a white yeah you have some
white on your cooler so he's also
talking about up to his upgrading his
graphics sorry Lord he's talking about
updating the graphics card so ignore the
aesthetics of the graphics card in the
blue highlight here this is also that I
have the same 970 by the way me too
it was the last thing I bought at Newegg
with my employee discount
yeah and whyphy build right now oh yeah
yeah but were you trying to reach any
repeat I wasn't trying I'm just saying
like it's a good car yeah it is
so yeah super clock I must say white
mm-hmm
try to find any sub it stands it stands
out a bit more um 1070 / TIR Vega 56
that's a really hard choice right now I
mean don't get a Vega 56 if it's
overpriced only get it if you can get it
for around the $400 price beyond that if
you can get a graphics card that's like
mostly black then I'd say some white
cables would look pretty clean or maybe
a black and white combination or
something like that
alternatively if you do go all black I
mean that matches with everything so
you'd have a little bit more flexibility
with the graphics card that you choose
so I mean those are those are kind of
the choices but I would say definitely
figure out your graphics card upgrade
first right and then base then do your
tables cable extensions on that I agree
that way if you happen to get say a red
accent graphics card which would look
fine in this system you know then you
can maybe get cables to match it or
something like that I think ASIS just
launched their arcs Vega
56 and 64 Strix models right you can
finally actually buy them now I think so
they sent them to reviewers like a month
or two ago yeah there's a bunch of weird
BIOS issues by those drivers and drivers
issues and stuff like that yeah but um
next up is the proper cysts thank you
sir he's been following the show and
interacting and stuff for a while so
thank you for sending in the rebuild hmm
I helped at team an underscore 80 with a
significant case in cooling upgrade an
tech ba din' fans Asus am3+ motherboard
T EVGA GTX 970 maybe the same one from
the the previous bill 2x4 gig ddr3
memory kit in each 100 IV to creative
lab lab song card and a Samsung is that
case upside down or why is this an tech
upside down no is it like a symmetrical
front panel that you can reverse maybe
these put it upside down I don't know
weird did he maybe he flipped it so it
can pick it open from the other side but
you wouldn't want to open it anyway
because it's just got a big radiator
right in the front
mmm looks cool but yeah it looks very
ominous I like I like the white lighting
I like the shadows that are being cast
by your fan grills that's kind of cool
oh yeah right over there that's nice
interesting to see fan girls on the
inside of your case yeah I'm not used to
seeing that so first thing I'll say is
obviously ketchup and mustard Mike the
hell hole here Oh what is that new boy
hero here what he's like gnawing at his
paw
it's it's like you keep talking okay so
look for the first thing you'll say is
ketchup and mustard obviously has to go
find some cable extensions actually this
reminds me a lot of my first build in
the the Corsair 600 T I had I had the
same sort of light blue heatsink
motherboard Izzy 68 asus and and I had
ketchup and mustard as well but I would
say get some nice either light blue
extensions to match all the accents in
your case or just get plain black maybe
a combination of the two but I have to
commend you on your cable management
this is a bit like this is as good as
you could have possibly done in this
entry-level to mid range case cable
management is absolutely I mean it looks
like something that you know that Paul
would do or that maybe I would you know
attempt to do it looks really good cable
management here is great the only thing
you're really lacking is a sort of color
coordination getting that red and yellow
out and I would say maybe spray paint
that that that PCI card that you've got
down there what is that so that oh it's
the creative maybe creative sama-sama
card or something like that who use the
Sam cards in here oh that's the other
that's the real question
spray paint that sucker either light
blue hoodoo light blue that would make
it stand out and look really cool as for
the fans it looks like you have some
different model fans in here the ones on
the front on your radiator or slightly
different than the ones the case fans on
the top and rear of your case and that
somewhat perks my OCD but I'm not gonna
knock you for it entirely I'm just gonna
say if you really want to tie everything
together having uniform fans throughout
your build is a thing of beauty in my
opinion but everything else looks
fantastic man cable management is again
stellar so thank you very much for that
next up we've got oh wait wait okay I've
got the let's try not to end the stream
trying to unplug anything here okay next
we've got one from Steven Steven to my
PC that's a core i7 6700k
point four gigahertz with the Noctua D
14 s kind of Z 107 a I'm thinking you
meant z170a m5 motherboard from MSI rip
just 5 16 gigs of memory and ddr4 at
3200 and we have an 850 Evo you might
win for us GTX 1078 gigabyte model um
very nice system
I love the case fantex make some great
chassis and it looks like you have some
decent airflow in here 2 large 200
millimeter fan at the front got a 120
looks to be on the bottom and some
exhaust at the rear curious that say I'm
sort of interested or you know surprise
it there's nothing going on at the top
no AI OHS no additional fans I think
that there'd be a bit more fans of a few
more fans at the top but especially with
the orientation where you have your CPU
cooler with the fan pointing straight up
I think maybe having a fan or two at the
top of your case could just help sort of
move the airflow the hot air that's
coming off your CPU heatsink out of the
top of your chassis personal opinion
cable management looks purty ok I feel
like there are some areas where it's
really good some areas where could be
improved for example in front of your
power supply you've got just the cable
looks like maybe it's part of your RGB
strip looks like it's part of your RGB
LED strip that is not the best place for
it just because I mean you've got LEDs
down there and the LEDs little the
lighting is sort of casting a shadow of
your RGB cable onto your power supply
and it doesn't look all that great IMO
so maybe I don't know rat that behind
your motherboard tray if you can get
some extensions if it's not long enough
and you know I personally I'm just used
to seeing CPU cooler towers in the more
vertical orientation than horizontal it
makes sense especially if you didn't
want to add any fans at the top of your
case circling back to that you already
have what at the rear so moving your
heatsink vertically would basically just
point that not to a fan straight back to
your case and that rear fan would kind
of help you exhaust some of that hotness
GPU everything looks good there I mean
if you want to get some cable extensions
obvious
like red red and black getting some red
and black sleeved extensions we'll look
fantasy like this and yeah I can't tell
what let's see I think that's pretty
much it dude I think you're good
elsewhere I spilled just do those things
if you want or don't and you'll be good
moving on thank you very much Steven
Johnny Johnny with horizon 516 hundred
and a 6 X 3 70 f gaming leather board 16
gigs of tread and z are gbgt X 1080
Strix watch out mill overclocked
currently because when I overclock the
CPU to 4 gigahertz the screen goes black
and the system freezes requiring me to
flip the power switch you have you have
a 1600 you're probably likely be able to
hit 4 gigahertz unless you get extremely
lucky in the silicon lottery I would aim
for 3.8 personally if you're lucky you
might get 3.9 but don't feel too bad I
can't even get 4 gigahertz on either of
my 1600s 3.9 on all cores is totally
fine with 1600 yeah yeah I guess I don't
know maybe I have a dud because I mind
wigs out sometimes a three-point I mean
yeah but not all of them can do it thank
you
true 3/8 or 3.85 is fine too mm-hmm yeah
looks like you've got some nice RGB fans
oh those are the the new l-series fans
from from Corsair so which basically
means you spent about as much on those
as you did for the rest of your system
but they look really great
don't don't regret it whatsoever they
look phantom ulis and let's see is that
a deep cool aerial yes I kept a 10 maybe
yeah I believe it's deep cool captain
yeah I'm not sure if 'srgb one or the
one that's just black and white
yeah either way it looks good RGB on the
trend Z looks great I'm gonna say maybe
rotate the the tubing I feel like the
tubing looping together it looks a
little bit better than going one up and
opposite direction like that looks like
they're repelling magnets or something
looks a little awkward yeah together
other than that the sticker on your m2
SSD is a WD that stands out you know
that
kind of a sort thought I believe it's a
green PCB underneath that though for
that SSD them it's a good SSD so nothing
wrong there if you just blasted it to
the whole thing yeah maybe something
like that if you really wanted to mask
it or invest in one of the SSD yeah yeah
like the the heat sinks you can get to
kind of go over them and you know give a
little bit of cooling and aesthetics as
well yeah but yeah overall looking
looking pretty good the thing that's
standing out to me just that I'd I mean
I think the only good fix would be
extensions to make it look much better
as your plugs for the graphics card
there it's a daisy chain there with a
little extra loop on it you might tie
those up a little bit better to just
make a little bit tidier yeah but
overall very nice very nice build yeah I
like it well done
I honestly can't look at my Google Doc
for some reason because that's okay I
can look at yours from now and this is
an honorable mention just wanted to give
a shout out to Scott Dilbeck who's also
a very longtime patron of the show he's
got thanks Scott looking forward to your
six dollars and sixty six donation later
on 7,700 KZ 270 motherboard h80 I cross
fired rx4 80s with eight gigs full
modular Corsair power supply in a 570 X
crystal that would be the corsair case
mm mid Tower um let's see alright it's
beautiful I like this sort of unique but
I think it's well executed
you see yeah it's it's definitely some
decorative traps yeah like I I tend to
use lots of velcro straps for not not so
much my my a oh tubing but for my cables
like if I have slaves extensions or
something like that I will use like two
or three velcro straps per cable just
because I like it nice and taut so I
guess that's sort of the the same
approach that you took here with your AO
tubes I like um and and your and your
PJs I think I think it works also
because you have the same sort of velcro
straps throughout it's not like you have
different ones
it's very uniform and you even have them
on your your power connectors for your
GPUs and I think that sort of ties
everything together it doesn't seem like
the ones on your
or out of place because they're sort of
visible throughout the rest of your
system as well and then I mean cable
management is fantastic from what I can
tell maybe you used poor lighting on
purpose so that I wouldn't be able to
see all of the little you know
imperfections but well it's great from
from what I can see here so nice job
nice wood
well done Skylar thank you for
submitting that yep that was the
honorable mention by the way I think
right yes yes and then we also have
let's see though does it fit my PC all
right okay I'm gonna try logging back
into Google account and reopening up the
drive dock because the Google Doc
because it it timed out for some reason
Oh unless it comes back right now hey
Bing am i voting I see you guys's
donations in super chat we will be
reading those at the end of this half so
keep giving us money all right let's
talk about some tech news right
everybody skipping case off
oh no no tech case off I told her good
luck okay second why isn't it slowing
look at this the first page of the
Google Doc I don't know it's not loading
that up it's weird okay I don't all
right
I don't know all right all right I think
we're good all right case off this is um
where we take we put two different cases
of similar similar pricing and and in
feature set against each other and we
decide at the end of our at the end of
the segment which one we would we would
opt for so the two cases that we have
going head-to-head today are the NZXT th
700 i versus the be quite dark base 700
these are both cases that came out this
quarter in this last quarter of 2017
they're both fresh off the Lots super
timely super timely and they both have
700 in the name they both they do you
know for some reason they make that
connection yes seven heads clearly
they're competitors in that sense and
even via price point right cuz the H 700
is going for 200 bucks
straight from NZXT and the dark bass 700
is 180 or 179 right now so only about 20
bucks off but when you're talking about
a more expensive case that 20 bucks
isn't really a huge difference so
starting with the h7 right we've got
both of these cases actually come
crystal RGB ready which means that they
feature tempered glass side panels and
do have elements of RGB functionality
built in the H 700 I has a smart hub
which is like a cam powered smart device
that uses machine learning to basically
create custom fan curves on the fly by
analyzing after a couple hours of
analyzing your system parameters to give
you the best fan curves possible I've
tested this out does drop your
temperatures a few degrees and I feel
like that's one of the biggest selling
points of this case and sort of NZ
excuse justification one of their many
justifications of why it costs $200.00
whether or not that's something for you
is up to you I suppose it also has some
pretty decent radiator support too 80s
or 360s can go at the front or the top
the only difference is that push pole is
pretty much only available at the front
you kind of have to resort to either
push or pull at the top because of that
cable management bar or the reservoir
bar that sort of sticks out
I feel very conflicted about the
reservoir ball bar you to you - I have
not taken my age 700 out of the box yet
oh okay
I I did the H 400 I oh yeah it's got a
similar configuration here yeah on one
hand the bar is really handy because it
has a reservoir mount and so if your
custom water cooling it's nice to have
to get a dedicated spot for mounting
that rez but at the same time if you're
not mounting a reservoir which most
people who buy this case probably won't
be it kind of gets in the way where is
it if you look at just the main side the
just the glamour side just the white bar
that sort of white bars are this big bar
yeah see the a I Oh like you barely have
enough clearance to fit those two fans
you couldn't do push pull at the top if
you okay if you had the option to so I
mean it's a little bit cumbersome I
don't know
and let me know what you guys think but
there's also no USBC on the front of
this case which I think for $200 of the
tail into 2017 that that should have
that should have been that should been
there I've been nice to have would have
been very nice to have we're seeing more
and more types II devices pop up and the
dark bass 700 there may be 700 170 bucks
you get also tempered-glass RGB I think
there's more
definitely more RGB it's more prominent
here you get those strips going down the
sides of the case the web site the web
their website UI is much easier to
scroll through I'll give I'll give them
that they video if anyone from NZXT s
like watching like website design yeah
this is this is a lot easier look you
have a little arrow I can just it's a
little thing um so this this case does
have USB see it also features Sam
dampening I feel like the the
shortcoming here the dark bass 700 is
that it's the had kind of some limited
airflow at the front even though it
looks like there's tons of ventilation
on either side the actual underneath the
front panel you you'll see that there's
smaller cutouts the internal plastic
frame doesn't really allow as much
breathability as it looks like on the
outside which is kind of a bummer
whereas the H 700 I definitely seems to
have a bit more airflow from the front
side
that being said does have sound
dampening it should be very probably
better than the h7 dry in terms of
acoustics it's got a reversible
motherboard tray which is pretty cool
you don't see many many cases be quiet
like sort of one of the people who are
that's a fun feature I feel like it is
it's one of those things cuz like people
have different desk setups and you match
the number one want to have the visible
part of your keys yeah you know here
there and have the you know the business
end where you plug everything in
rationed here there and being able to
flip it yeah it's very nice yep I'm
actually yeah it's totally um and then
we've also got a dual rail fan
controller with six PWM headers that's
kind of cool it's dual rail so using the
controller on the front panel you can
actually connect like you can control
three fans independently from another
three fans so if you want like you know
three fans in your case to spin up a
certain rpm you can have that
different than the other three fans or
you can have them both spin at the same
rpm very flexible there's a lot of
innovation in this case it's also great
to build in both cases are honestly
really great to build in I feel I should
have also mention the H 700 I has
amazing cable management behind the
motherboard tray with all the cable
channels does the the H 400 I also have
those yes it's it's not the those
channels probably channels but yeah it's
got its got a configuration kind of like
it's got one of these vertical spaces
rather than two yeah and it's got a
channel across the top as well yeah that
was I found to be that nice you know way
- yeah I mean you gotta kind of wedge
cables in there sometimes and I was
dealing with a situation where that's
because it's right there mm-hmm I had a
bunch of NZXT air fans as well mm-hmm so
all those have two cables one for the
actual fan and one for the lighting that
all you have to wire over to connect to
a hue plus or however you want to
connect it up sure so um a lot of wires
lots of lots of cable management to do I
was able to get it all in there
I had to kind of attack it twice it was
one of those ones where like I did it
all once fledged it in but then I was
like I had to come back to it again and
kind of redo things once I kind of knew
where everything was going right but
yeah I mean I was able to get it in
there yeah I guess is the main point I
think even with all those extra wires
yeah I definitely think it's it's good
for like amateur like a novice
first-time builders just kind of like
gives you a guideline as to where the
cable should how they should flow yeah
it was the velcro straps around them -
yeah pretty nice very helpful so um
honestly it's a tough pick band they're
both built like tanks they have really
good build quality they're fun to build
in they have their own unique set of
features so I guess because they're so
close together I feel like I don't
Valley I don't personally get much out
of the the smart device with the machine
learning thing I can make my I like I
like making my own fan curves I think
the smart device is very convenient for
first-time builders but takes the fun
out of it for me personally so it's not
worth the $200 as much as for someone
else I would say I would save 20 30
bucks and go with the dark base 7
that's me personally but they're both
great cases I don't know what do you
think thoughts I haven't had the
opportunity to work with both of them
but the USBC 3.1 I think functionally
stands out a lot to me as well as the
flippable motherboard tray yeah I mean
you're definitely one one who needs it
and wants it bad enough to modify your
define r52 to actually put a USB to USB
I didn't flip the motherboard tray in
there to find him yeah I did I did yeah
I did it more as a proof of concept like
show you that you could add it to just
like an existing case if you had the
cable I was raised because honestly this
is the most impractical computer of all
the computers I have to add that to yeah
I plug in an external USB three drives
all the time to transfer massive amounts
of video back and forth yeah that's my
gaming computer I never transfer video
onto or off of thats alright it's handy
from the steam library I suppose yeah
but yeah see I think I would lean
towards for the feature set I would lean
towards the to be quiet 700 as well nice
guys go ahead and you blog chat blog
chat right now blub press n for NZXT if
you want the H 700 I and do b4 be quiet
if you want the dark bass 707 blow it up
let me see where your B's and ends
give me some B's and ends all right
we're gonna move on to our next second
then your vanilla
like mint which is news looks like I'm
seeing more bees than ends it's pretty
it's pretty I know a Twitter YouTube
Twitter she's going crazy
twitch likes the bees and YouTube's
likes the ends YouTube in ends yes it's
kind of fun watching them go actually I
was wondering why twitch wasn't
responding it's because my twitch is
broken now your switches birth or it's
my challenge they started getting crazy
a new like doing like 30 bees at the
time yeah putting some emoji and there's
someone put F first faxes it's almost
like it's almost like we've divided chat
into two
like two different into 300 games and
that they all hate each other now like
definitely makes us hate the animal
makes the gang sign and advise your
senator just one letter and and for life
I'm Abby biatch way to be easy what up B
we to end yeah what ends all right cool
well it seems pretty evenly divided and
they're both great cases so that makes
sense
yeah let's move on to take news thank
you guys for your input quite literally
um AMD AMD whats up with AMD man what's
up with their graphics card Department
they've been sneakily making some tweaks
to their rx 560 video cards actually
making them worse without telling their
loyal fan base this is an article from
Brad Jacques at Jesse world sharkus your
kiss oh there's a whore in there or it's
a silence it's a to pronounce it's not a
silent it's an invisible arm or you can
call him Brad choco taco shack a circus
but he hates that okay I don't know if
he would never do that to bread Brad
Shaka's thank you very much for this
article this is about AMD you guys
probably heard this it's been all over
the place on the hardware subreddit and
stuff there are some rx5 60's that have
actually been shipping with fewer
compute units and streaming processors
than other RX 5 60's for no apparent
reason
this hasn't been made publicly just a
lot of the drama it been announced
publicly it's kind of luck of the draw
it's like you you order an RX 560 from
whatever added board partner
it might come with 16 compute units or
it might come with 14 compute units you
don't know isn't that a scary thought it
makes it so exciting it might become no
it doesn't makes it so like horrifying
I'm not gonna get no it's it's it's like
a loot crate
you don't really pay for a loot crate in
the typical sense you're paying out the
Ashford's for video cards these days
even the RX 560 you know any mean like
this is a lot of money for a lot of
people or you could be getting you know
a thousand and 24 stream processors or
896 stream processors it just kind of
depends like Paul said luck of the draw
you really don't know what you're gonna
get when you buy an RX 560 and I think
that's
wrong I think that's unfair you should
know what specs your cards gonna have
before you buy it
so these cards it's like the price
overlap isn't even that significant like
there's there's there's there's the 14
Cu 896 stream processor units selling
for 125 to 167 dollars and there's the
16 Cu 1,024 stream processing units
selling for between 125 and 200 dollars
but like and there's the same time
staying on here and and that's what
makes it even less ethically sound is
that AMD selling slower RX v 60s from
the same price there abouts as faster RX
v 60s and they're not telling people
they're not they have never publicly
announced that some of our RX 5 60s are
actually cut down versions of a full-fat
RX 560 and this is uh this is actually
there was a if you look at the internet
archive's wayback machine july 7th was
the last time that there was a
screenshot of the AMD RX 560 page which
actually showed all of the all of the
the old original I'm sorry the full fat
the full fat 16 compute unit version of
the card so the cut down model release
probably happened sometime after that we
don't know exactly but it's just
all-around shady Brad said that the RX
560 is on new egg right now seem to be
pretty evenly split between the new
versions and the cut-down versions are
the nerfed versions if you will so just
be careful guys know know the specs of
the card you're getting before you get
it because not even that is safe or
sacred these days with companies big
companies just trying to you know pull
one over your eyes or whatever it is so
it's kind of these are the wayback
machines listed specs yeah it does say
max compute units which is also kind of
like what does that mean
yeah it seems like just it should then
it should say max stream processors
because that's also know that's straight
okay
consistency yeah some continuity flaws
here not AMD like as well as AMD's doing
on the cpu front I feel like they're
doing equally bad on their GPU front
does it seem that way to you too
it depends on what you consider bad if
you not a really bad maintaining this is
bad positive relations with PC gamers
yeah
then yeah they're not doing that great
if you consider bad to be like oh
they're not selling any of the graphics
cards I would disagree because there's
so much of their graphics carry but they
don't really have much of an inventory
of for graphics cards cuz they sell them
all a little bit more now but ok give it
give it give it a few months after they
actually have decent stock of their
cards yeah I mean I mean they're setting
they're setting themselves up for
potential future failure if they don't
capture enough of the gaming market if
they don't get enough people to invest
in stuff like free sync monitors yeah if
they have a massive amount of their
graphics cards sold to minors who then
in a few months
decide that you know because of the
changes in the cryptocurrency mining
landscape that the graphics cards aren't
worth it anymore so they start selling
them also the market is flooded with
like really low priced AMD graphics
cards then you know D values their
existing the stuff and they have a hard
time selling that again so I mean I
think yeah there's just definitely
negative repercussions to to what
they're doing but yeah I know we'll see
see I guess I don't know I just feel
like they're selling a lot of like Bega
cards now but I feel like it's a lot of
that has to do with the fact that you
could not get an R weeks make a card
when it first launched they were just
very scarce and now that they're finally
here you know months after launch people
are buying them up left and right but
that's not the same as doing a
successful launch where you have a
ton of supply and months later people
are still buying the crap out of them
you know what I mean like anyone can
sell a product
 I'm on launch day or as soon as you
have supply but it'll be interesting to
see where we are a couple months down
the line if you know just sort of the
you know because we've been comparing a
lot of the CPU rankings like on Amazon
like what's the number one CPU and like
rise ins been killing it over Intel and
stuff curious to see what the the GPU
segment is like but I guess I guess
we'll say that for another time
let's move on though we have a lot of
other stuff to cover here we do
including Qualcomm ten eval comm
stepping up to the point boy oh boy
they are sticking it to Intel with their
Snapdragon Windows 10 convertibles this
is an article from hot hardware there's
been a new wave or there will be a new
wave of Windows 10 devices powered by
the Snapdragon 835 arm-based processors
from Qualcomm course this is made
possible by Microsoft support for full
oh excuse me
full x86 emulation in Windows 10 does
not previously possible a Snapdragon
processor an ARM based processor would
not be able to run the Windows 10
operating system until Microsoft allowed
support for this sort of thing to happen
there's also no limitations on what
applications for the most part that this
the hardware can run so you're not
limited to just the universal Windows
platform apps you can actually run
legacy win32 applications which means
you have full pretty much full
compatibility with a lot like the
massive catalog of windows-based
software so this is a direct competitor
to Intel because it's a basically
replacing the CPU it's it's a great
alternative Qualcomm is estimating in
devices in the ultra slim convertible
segment and the category is gonna that
the category is gonna be shipping in
globally in 2018 that's a lot of ultra
slim notebooks and stuff that are gonna
be hitting the market next year
projecting to hit 126 million by 2022
so it makes a lot of sense why Qualcomm
would be interested in this segment of
the PC market the numbers are pretty
overwhelming people like ultra slim
notebooks like the MacBook Air that's
immensely popular you know it's
competing with sales with the
with the original just the standard
MacBook because people want lighter
thinner lighter lighter and thinner you
know but you know obviously there's some
downfalls about your battery life longer
battery life fortunately Snapdragon 835
SOC will likely deliver the single
biggest jump in battery performance that
we've ever seen in this category of
device users may see 20 plus hours per
charge some devices topping twenty five
hours that's insane
I can't even imagine simulated I mean
you wouldn't have to charge your laptop
if you go wireless for a whole weekend
pretty much if you know if you used it
eight hours a day no worries that's
pretty cool that's insane
that's really cool also there's way less
PCB required than with an Intel chip so
that leaves it up to manufacturers to
utilize that free space within the
laptop for other things maybe there's
more MDOT to storage or you know bigger
badder GPUs more cooling so that you can
fit faster GPUs and things like that let
me cool or gummy bears gummy bears you
know just emergency gummy bears snap
drawer and the side of the computer
right yep exactly store the company
after I'm gaming for a while Mike I need
some hurry bow we're gonna crack that
 it's definitely a practical
practical application for for additional
cabin space in your laptop and then
we've also got let's see what are the
other things here HP Lenovo and Asus are
gonna be featuring the Qualcomm
Snapdragon x16 4G LTE modems in their
models hey which is gonna give us speeds
of 1 gigabits per second down and
provides three to seven times faster
download speeds compared to average
learning for dogs barking broadband
connection
the show is brought to you corgis barks
to make it sound like all Reaver be
space dogs unite dogs alright so what I
was gonna say is holy 4G LTE baked
into these ultra-thin super battery life
convertibles nice that's pretty cool
that means you don't need to rely on
freaking Wi-Fi in order to tweet out
something from your laptop which is
fantastic I hate that it really is like
an always-on solution always connected
which is great if you're always on the
go and you don't always have you know
Wi-Fi at hand there was supposed to be
running cooler than the Intel
alternatives with lower thermals under
sustained workloads Intel's not super
happy about this high Intel is not super
happy about this earlier earlier this
year when they were celebrating the 40th
year anniversary of the world's first
x86 microprocessor Intel vowed to flex
its legal muscle this is a quote from
the article to stop the deployment of
devices using x86 emulation in Windows
10 that's clearly I was a failed
endeavor because Qualcomm is already on
that you know what anything we can
stick to Intel at this point honestly
yeah you're like in like AMD is already
handling the desktop side of the the CPU
market why not Qualcomm tackle on the
mobile side because it's gonna only lead
to lower prices and better performance
for the end user at the end of the day
and I'm all for 20 20 plus hours of
battery life any
week so very exciting stuff next up
we've got the reven the reven nyah-nyah
240 a liquid cooler which has been
released this is a via hexxus i didn't
really have too many notes on this
because we ran short on time prepping
for the show but it's supposed to be
retailing for a hundred and nine USD
which really isn't bad these days for a
240 millimeter AIO apologize it's also
got a transparent coolant reservoir
section atop the pump block the unit is
factory sealed however there is an
opening available on the transparent
cooling block which facilitates the
injection of dyes you can actually
change up the dye color inside of the
loop which I think it's pretty it's a
fun customizable option for an AO or
even supplies see my coolant dies so
that you can mix the color of course of
your preference to match other computer
components additionally the pump I sent
to be aw AP design or water above pipe
design so and I quote the cooler can
also be installed in any orientation
without sacrificing pump power pumping
power micro channels at just 0.1 one
millimetres feature on the curved base
plates of these coolers which are said
to provide efficient heat transfer and
you can see that there's two fans
obviously on the on the radiator or even
has specs to of its 120 millimeter cold
wing fans to deliver high airflow at 25
decibels it's a pretty saturated market
already but I'm not gonna knock
companies for coming up with new options
I think it looks pretty cool the water
block looks alright the fans the fans
look strikingly like Venturi's like
fractal venturi air flow type fans just
the blade design and stuff doesn't look
like they have any rubber on the corners
yeah that's that's kind of unfortunate
and again it's a hundred and nine bucks
so it's sort of on the mid to low end
and I'm not a huge fan of the what do
you call that coagulated tubing no not
quite delighted but corrugated core was
a quite Gilead miss deleted gesticulated
mistake you lated mister accumulated the
tubing looks just a little dated ribbed
for her pleasure
ribbed
super ribbed for her pleasure but no
one's really being pleased by this at
the end of the day anti kink it is anti
kink its anti kink short it just doesn't
the tank is refillable yeah as long as
you remove it from being attached to
your motherboard and use this little
filler thing mm-hmm
and add color ink what what yeah you can
you can make though you can add I think
it comes with some dye comes baby
bottles of RGB die blue yellow and green
that can be mixed into the coolant to
match your rigs color scheme that's
pretty cool cool it seems like a one and
done though like you'd like your if
you're dripping drips of coloring into
that or whatever like what do you mean I
mean if you just want blue or red or
yellow then do some drips and you're
fine yeah I'm saying if you wanted to do
like orange or some in-between color
right and you're adding drops of
different colors of ink and once you do
that with food coloring if you're not
doing the right specific combination you
get to sort of a muddy brown color yeah
towards black and then right there's
really no turning back from there well I
mean you could just drain the loop and
refill it and try again possibly why not
but why possibly I mean it's it's a
refillable with dye will it'll stain
everything a little suck all right and I
don't know I'm speculating anyway so
it's a possibility it's possible I'll
give you that okay
but moving on to our last article here
I'm gonna read your can I just read your
laptop Paul because oh yeah I can just
go off the article here Google is gonna
be pulling YouTube because my computer
is not working at the moment
Google is gonna be pulling YouTube's
support from Amazon's fire TVs in 2018
this sort of is centered around the
Amazon echo show that's their you know
special device and Google and Amazon
have had a weird sort of combative
relationship where Amazon has not really
been Google friendly they haven't really
sold like the Google chromecast or
Google home Google nest they haven't
been selling any Google products on
their website and Amazon sells pretty
much anything so you know it's personal
and that's not okay it's not okay man
that's not okay Google it's like it's
like having two best friends like Google
Amazon are my two best friends online
cuz they're just awesome and I use them
for everything I think we need and so
when your two best friends aren't lik to
stand up and say that's not OK Google
yeah everyone go tweet Google and Amazon
put them both both in your same tweet
and be like why can't we be friends why
can't we be friends why can't we be
friends okay
so there's this sort of a struggle
that's the second seeing people in chat
say that I just activated their ghost is
intentional thank you okay Google say
search gay porn and pupils I have so
much power I do not apologize in advance
okay
do not pass go do not collect ecology
alright um so yeah Amazon actually found
a way to find to make YouTube run on the
echo show but they somehow did it
unbeknownst to Google or without their
go ahead oh so Google freaked out was
like hey you guys did NASA's permission
and you're also providing sort of a
shitty experience apparently they
weren't happy with the implementation
that Amazon used to integrate YouTube
into the echo show and they were saying
that that violates their Terms of
Service so there's this all this like
they're just like you know measuring
 at this point right there - tech
giant's obviously and their butting
heads and and Google I think wants to
work with Amazon but Amazon seems very
Amazon seems like the reluctant one
obviously we don't know for sure but
that's what it seems like on the surface
and so because of that the sort of
sketchy version of YouTube that's
currently available in the echo show is
going to be cancelled and prohibited
starting January 1st to 2018 so if you
have an echo show and you're watching
videos on YouTube with it prepare to
have that stopped it's it's it's gonna
be gone pretty soon so um yeah that's
those are pretty much all the articles
that I have that's pretty much my half
of the show we do have some Johnson
shout outs free
all who happen to pick up something
merchandise wise from either of our
stores I can go ahead and read off mine
first while Paul does things we've got a

wearing that stuff oh yeah we're done
with the first half no no we're not give
donations donations yes yes people
questions
yeah and they sent money so we will and
I cannot view them because frickin
browsers alright I'll have your views of
the five dollar donation
sup guys Kyle I'm diggin the floatplane
content and community Paul and highly
jealous of both your beard and your
truck cheers from El Jefe have a
beards coming off soon I don't believe
you for me and gel symmetric it's pretty
awesome I need to get a watch though a
floatplane is there anything like that's
only for plot what floatplane they've
been doing is it all just like I'm
really kind so exclusive life's live
streams will start within the next
couple weeks
oh it's very soon well that'll be really
fun and then I mean apart from just like
early access I mean people are gonna see
the part three of the elite build before
anybody else on YouTube they're gonna
see me surprising my grandpa with a 4k
TV after his CRT upgrade oh um it's it's
gonna be pretty epic so there's a lot of

you're all done
coaching everyone can I guarantee the
braiding yoobin
deck at the Quinta Taryn quick dick
Tarantino take a Clinton to turn I love
your movie five dollars Canadian hey
dick Quinn here from Canada
need help deciding on which motherboard
gigabyte Z 370 or scheming 7 or one of
the asrock x 370 mm I have a $350 budget
damn you thought worse came with 7
boards are pretty sexy is it those are
two different platforms ZX 370 is
talking about AMD versus Intel which
makes it a that's a larger question than
just the should I get the gigabyte or
should I
Oris which so should I give this user
that should be the question yeah I mean
I can't we can't answer your question
directly if it's between those two
motherboards if you were like the
gigabyte z3 70 horas and the as Roxy 370
I'd say I would lean towards a gigabyte
granted that's that's high level that's
not looking more specifically at the cut
at that those exact boards or not but in
your choice of z3 70 versus x3 70 right
now if all you're doing is gaming z3 70
if you're gaming and doing other stuff
with your cpu gave me an streaming video
editing go rise a nation any think that
thing then go for eyes it that's my
recommendation agreed
thank you Scott Dilbeck six dollars in
66 cents Cheers
favorite Elder Scrolls or Fallout title
some somehow I missed New Vegas and it's
blowing my effing mind I have not played
well i played skyrim i played the elder
scrolls skyrim and I enjoyed it but it
just it didn't keep my interest he
didn't hold my interest for very long I
got bored of it I know call me crucify
me or whatever and I have never played
another I've never played a Fallout game
crucified me twice yeah you've chosen to
syriza's that I've dabbled with but not
played extensively
I have also played a little bit of
Skyrim and I've played a little bit of
fallout I played New Vegas and it was
fun
so I'd say definitely Fallout New Vegas
if you haven't tried it definitely try
it out and I only I didn't play it very
extensively and stuff so yeah but Scott
I hope you're enjoying Fallout New Vegas
Elder Scrolls Skyrim also quite fun poop
Slayer six six six five dollar donation

Zachary Hummel with twenty dollars last
week I gained one subscriber for my one
video from Madden 16 that was uploaded a
couple years ago and they unsubscribed
sad day Zach we feel yet hey you know
what we we experienced the same thing
buy it by the thousands every month so
we'll drink one right there with you for
the lost subscribers press f to pay
respects tom's brim smith's with the
fifty Norwegian kroner bribes me Paul
I would buy your key caps but I have
Logitech Romer G keyboard you room he's
got he's got a Logitech Cal you have a
chance to get my money so here saying
make a cute app that is compatible with
little Logitech's then it uses the
little cross caps the the yep chariot us
will teach them it doesn't crust him of
the which one Logitech's um the rubber G
it's a different key cap tape yeah Tom's
I'm sorry about that
based on the sales of the cherry version
I'll see if I want to expand that for
for the Logitech Palomino kid with the
$10 donation in no comment thank you
Palomino kid you're wonderful MB 67 aka
lenticular $15 happy holidays talent
Paul happy holidays ma'am right back at
ya Cheers and indeed David Chao leave a
child $5 if I had a bow and arrow and
the pointed at your knee and force you
to choose between Imperial or stone
Crocs
which would you choose and why what
would the widow what the would you
choose PO anyway well don't you tell me
give me your watch on an imperial so I
can pure like the Imperials like the
metric system and start well versus oh
and P realises Stormcloaks
what I know Imperial troopers but
Stormcloaks is that not even too nerdy
for us I don't know it's it's it's
probably a game that we don't
I'm gonna say Imperials because I'm it's
somewhat vaguely familiar and I have no
idea what's storm Clark's storm storm
course Karen oh okay
Skyrim yes Tom or da cereal probably if
you played Skyrim for more than five
minutes you probably you probably
realize this so yeah alright Stormcloak
seems to be the the right answer
according to Google Google yeah sorry we
couldn't shed more light on that need to
play more Skyrim clearly I should have
maybe we'll have plenty of time on
Saturday we should start Skyrim from the
beginning the game just twelve hours
yeah nothing but Skyrim can easily beat
it in 12 hours as long as we get the
slim jim mod where all the dragons turn
into the slim jim guy oh yeah when he
flies right oh yeah breeds much fire on
all the children we should do yeah
alright Anubis mark $8 Paul try official
appeal tolls with omega 3 for hero's
itch Thank You Anubis I am not sure
what's going on with Hiro this evening
tripping he's he's going after one of
his paws and it's not it wasn't it
wasn't good but my wife's here now and
she's looking after him thank you though
for your suggestion Thank You Man
we justin fichelson we will give him
some of that yeah Loret endo $5 Kylie do
you ever get around to trying the sambal
I sent some ball some ball some ball I
don't know what what that is I if you
sent it recently I have not checked my
p.o box in a few weeks like two three
weeks so it's possible that it's still
whatever the sambal is it might still be
chill in there but I'll get around to it
I always do I feel like that's like we
open that and it was like or we tried it
or we opened it and we didn't actually
try it whatever it was it was a drink or
a food
let's see what have you gotten recently
we got beer we got lots of beer
you trying to the beer was it the chilli
sauce the Sun Bowl oh oh the chilli
sauce I have not tried the judge says
it's the chilli sauce okay I have not
tried that yet it is actually still in
the studio right next to the whiskey
which I've been drinking daily but we
have not tried the Sun Bowl yet
why if he sauce hasn't cracked it open
because I don't think it's it's
vegetarian or vegan I think it has like
fish sauce or something in it but I'll
bring it home I'll make a point to bring
it home every time I it's funny cuz
every time I pour the whiskey I look at
the Sun Bowl let me go - it looks good
it looks really good
I'm a huge sucker for like all things
chilli and spicy so I will be trying it
trust me
I mean I am the guy to send that to I
will I will definitely eat it up soon
enough but there are a bunch more
comments so we should try to get to them
quick all right so I'm rambling this
okay what are we had destinations
anonymous uh yes I've always loved the
show guys I have a request Paul turn
your soundboard up to full demon mode
once that's done Kyle should bust out
his number one best asian voice oh that
would be scary let's do that on the live
stream if we have time yeah the live
stream or the oh the gaming stream thank
you very much destinations Dave redick's
or Fredrickson five dollars you guys are
awesome keep up the great work
thank you very much they appreciate it
Zizi Hardy ten dollars Australia's
salute salute salute to you yeah nicolai
are sinners much of that five
argentinian hi guys what should I
upgrade to I have an asus rog be 350 r5
1600 and hyper to t4 cooler
512 gigs 960 pro SSD 16 gigs of g.skill
3200 to msi vegas 64 and crossfire damn
cool don't look great at all upgrade
your CPU your hyper tooth for cooler
sucks I mean an r5 1600 with to Vega 64
's upgrade your CPU yeah you can go to
1,700 1,700 X or 18 yeah and I've
created cooler and those everything else
is good
yeah coast of Harambee if I am GBP
estimated difference in temp and for
estimated difference in temperature on a
CPU only
loop from a single 364 360 rad to a dual
360 rad really hot core i7 68 50k I got
24.7 that needs better cooling I can't
tell you because I haven't tested that
directly myself I would say I don't know
5 to 15% anywhere within that range yeah
that's a very specific like setup and
difference in in in configuration that
you're talking about yep
I mean you're adding a lot of additional
cooling by adding a completely
additional 360 rats I would expect it to
significantly reduce the liquid
temperature you know maybe 10 degrees
but you're never gonna know unless you
actually test it out in benchmarking
yeah a be comparison do it and then it
wiII stay so we got Ian
jaesik five dollars if I have a 6700 K
and I can get a 7700 K for 192 bucks
should I buy it and try to sell my old
6700 K would it be worthwhile even if I
break even in no at the same clock
speeds of 6700 K and the 77 HK are
exactly the same chip so unless here's
6700 K over clocks like a dog and he
can't get much frequency out of it
you're really not gonna get much
performance boost out of a 77 700 K
maybe you'll be able to run it in one or
two hundred megahertz faster again it's
luck of the draw
yeah you might even have a sixty Center
700 K that overclocks really well and a
77 under K that doesn't reflect really
well when 6700 K does better yeah and so
I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't bother
with that particular upgrade yeah
next we've got rod 9 0 to 65 this is my
father and locked
oh hi rod this is Rodney 20 bucks you
stop giving me money
father but thank you I was going to get
a Shakey's large pepperoni and sausage
pieces tonight it sounds pretty typical
that sounds good it's so good but I
didn't have but I didn't so I have an
extra 20 bucks Kyle and Heather love
Shakey's Pizza that is true although
Heather eats although my wife would not
eat anything on it other than dad and
the sauce now that she's vegan so she
like
she can't have cheese the the point is
is that she can't have any food that
tastes good that's amazing look the
point is is that I get to eat all of it
if it brings enjoyment when you put it
in your mouth it's vegan not it's not
vegan oh yeah yeah
yes but thank you very much Riley
appreciate so Jojo boy 26 $5 hey I'm a
new pc builder and I still haven't
actually built a PC yet but thanks to
bit would I know how to build one all
right sweet
you're welcome Jojo sure you watch the
tutorial video and had no problems with
that dingo on my $45 do you guys play
platinum games like Bayonetta Metal Gear
Rising near automata vanquish other
action games like Devil May Cry
I've never played any of those games not
really everything like is really good
this year though if that's the same game
I'm thinking about my friend swears by
Devil May Cry I've heard that's really
fun yeah but I haven't haven't tried
many of those that you've suggested
dingo I'm at 40 I'm sorry yeah Gigi B's
$13 37 cents to see what you did there
as rock a be 350 ITX won't pick up mouse
and keyboard when I try to install
windows 7 tried ps2 adapter for Mouse no
good hooked up sshd to personal rig and
install the success but I TX can't
identify boot drive BOTS can't identify
the boot drive make sure that identified
a good choice to it after hmm make sure
that means the way is phrased as
confusing cuz he's talking about an ass
Rock motherboard but then he says hooked
up SSD the personal rig does that mean a
completely different system and install
was a success it's it's hurt yeah yes
his personal rig was able to identify
the sshd but his asrock ITX can't
identify as a boot drive perhaps that's
what I'm thinking I it sounds like you
have a faulty motherboard honestly
because Windows 7 like if you can't even
are your mouse and keyboard recognized
in the BIOS yeah that's a good then
indicator yeah but you might potentially
faulty motherboard yeah would be my
Heather hey it's my wife wife you sauce
$5 no dad Shakey's is your favorite
pizza it is his favorite pizza but you
know what I'm a Shakey's fan too so I'm
just gonna whip that's why I like the
Mojo potatoes yep
thank you very much honey I'll be sure
to pay you back we'll have a nice dinner
at McDonald's or something okay cool
five dollars after you review Kyle I got
a dark base 700 and building a 1700 X
and 1080i hoping to squeeze a 240 and a
360 radiator in it thanks for what you
do that sounds like a fantastic idea
yeah best of luck to you and appreciate
all the support
Brian Webb five dollars and 55 cents I
need my computer McDaniel after my
grandfather Dan who died in January he
always wanted to build a computer with
me but we never got the chance
ah that's too bad honestly um I'm sorry
about that Brian that's like iMeet but
also kind of sad yeah but but I'm glad
you were able to build your system yeah
Cheers and in his memory used to your
grandfather I don't have anything to
drink I have a grandfather to I have one
my sip but I'll choose whatever heir
Cheers that's fine
Tyra that man um Fred grant 25 bucks
here you go what 34 inch curved monitor
D recommend not price point best one I
mean I think your options are pretty
much the x34 predator from a sir and the
PG I mean whatever from a soos is theirs
there's a lot more 34 inch curved
monitors out there if you're looking
specifically at sales specifically
looking at 21 by 9 and gsync then yeah
predator exit e4 is a good option
there's the X 35 now as well though
there's also quite a few options that
are cheaper if you don't need cheese
sync that you can get for like 500 600
bucks yeah a lot of you a lot of them
use the same panel like the Reynolds the
same that's just a different housing
around it and maybe it may or may not
have the G sink yeah so yeah Fred I
don't think we can give you a straight
up here's exactly what you should get
option yeah they're all something
different in their own way but but
they're all good but if you're dedicated
to getting to gsync then
the x34 and our experience we've had has
been great a good experience with and
it's since it's been out for a little
while now you might be able to get for a
little bit a little bit cheaper than it
was originally yeah
Oh Martindale five dollars I got my
pixel two a couple days ago and it takes
excuse me it takes a full minute for it
to be recognized by Windows over USB
tried every port and three different
cables I have not getting run into that
issue with my pixel two once you turn on
the USB debugging mode within your your
phone it should connect pretty quickly
with like a USBC cable so I'm not
exactly sure what's going on there you
might just have a slow system maybe make
sure that there are no background
processes running that don't need to be
but I can't really give you much more
than that unless I have a closer look at
your system but thank you very much done
blessed for the donation Omar
all right next we've got Bryce Williams
way forward for the five bucks please
help I've tried to find it but how do I
get my PC and Xbox to sound into the
same headset y'all gave me all the PC
knowledge I have today umm how do you
get your PC and Xbox one sound into the
into a single headset umm I don't have
an Xbox you have an Xbox Paul have you
ever try to type both the sound of your
xbox and your PC into a single set of
headphones no yeah I'm not sure but it
honestly seems like a really easy Google
search though so I would I would look to
Google because Google knows more than we
do
I'm sorry we don't have more intramodal
than that Bryce you need you need a
mixer you need something that you can
connect both devices to that you can
connect the single vase oh yeah what
people in chat are saying same thing did
it get a mixer different solutions for
that some that are more advanced and
expensive than others but since we
haven't done it ourselves yeah we don't
have any exact hey do this solution but
chat is blowing up right now with some
options yeah reach it they know more
than we do
yes Pierre Danny Lou thank you very much
sir Danny Lou for the five Canadians
would my Corsair 120 HD RGB fans work on
ddr3 asus be 85 plus motherboard why
would they not they will definitely work
quoth the
I love their GB would work I mean the
standard RGB plug mm-hmm are they
addressable I think those are just oh
those actually might be addressable go
do that one HDS
but if that was the case they'd have to
use the Corsair that some controller
right yeah just use the sorcerer link or
whatever so yeah yeah
quoth the oboe $5 building my first PC
thank you for being awesome my dad is an
IT and has built many computers
computers but it's much easier to watch
too attractive now it's uh-huh yeah
that's very kind of you yeah yep yep you
got it we are sexy as hell
James Brule for the 10 bucks thank you
guys for the awesome videos I just
finished my PC build thanks to you guys
keep it up my question is if I bought
the ammo would you all come to South
Texas for some explosions I was
literally just in Texas where there were
many explosions around me so I'm all
explosion doubt at the moment but if the
opportunity of her arises I'll be sure
to look into look into that offer I
agree
thank you very much James yet yep gaming
$10 built my first gaming PC because
your of your awesome content I started
my own channel because of you guys yeah
yet gaming sweet good luck to you on
your new on your new channel yet and
it's probably the best thing we've ever
seen Congrats on building your first
gaming PC that too Jim our bar our book
our markets our market all right 250 PHP
very close to PC I believe that's a
Philippine Peso though okay yeah okay
sure well we'll call it that hi guys i
have a corsair 6 extreme EA TX
motherboard and a 360 by 60 millimeter
radiator i'm having a hard time picking
a case that would fit it I don't want to
do a full ATX case I just want a mid
Tower um honestly yes Philippine Peso
both okay cool oh you know your
Philippine currency I've been to the
Philippines multiple times um honestly
there's a lot of mid-tower cases out
there that are sort of like oversized
mid towers I'd even say like the some of
the ones that we talked about today like
the H 700 I and the dark base 700 those
are pretty hefty mid towers
that might be able to fit what you're
looking for 360 by 60 I think I think
either of those could could fit it
either at the front of the top no
problem so give those a look there's a
bunch of other options out there - Ryan
Blackwell $5 Kyle please Arno now Kyle
please explain why a Norris a Norris
water block won't fit strict for my
friend David it's because it's freaking
David
why the would anything work for
David why an amorous water block won't
fit strix because it's closed so no I
can explain this so water blocks remain
specifically to fit on top of a graphics
card and the graphics card the
significant then the important part of
the graphics card is the PCB the actual
circuit boards it's printed and it's
laid out and there's a GPU in the middle
and this probably some memory around
there and there's some power delivery
and everything so when you're talking
about two different graphics cards from
two different vendors there might be the
reference design the original design and
a lot of different vendors will use that
original design in which case a water
block would be compatible with all those
original designs a lot of vendors make
their own custom designs for that PCB
and they might move stuff around or
whatever so that's why a water block
specifically made for instance for an
Oris GTX 10 atti might fit a certain way
on top of the GPU and where the memory
is and where the power delivery is but
the Asus GTX 10 atti that's specifically
is that that they designed how they
wanted to might have things in slightly
different locations so that's why
they're not compatible good is that
better myself Paul very well said I will
put next time we've got one from Jackson
954 the 6.66 Canadians build my first PC
thanks to you guys but I should but
should I upgrade my cooler master master
master box light five later due to
restricted air flow 8700 k GT X 1080 16
gigabytes of ddr4 would have been nice
to know what case you're coming from to
be honest but if you should I upgrade my
masked Knight cooler master master box
that's what he was upgrading to if you
want an upgradable case the cooler
master master series and the various
flavors it comes in is a good option
there because they have lots of
different add-ons and front panels and
top panels and radiator brackets and all
that kind of stuff that you can add on
so if you're talking about upgrading due
to restricted air flow then potentially
yes I mean you're talking about a
standard ATX case so you might be able
to remove a front panel and add more
fans or something like that so yeah yeah
I would say yes yeah Jackson you should
upgrade yeah this your airflow then do
it
Arthur six five dollars I have a 1080i
but I don't know what monitor to get
should I go for a 2560 by 1440 60 my 9
panel or 2560 by 1080 ultra wide both
are 144 Hertz IPS between those I go for
the 2560 by 1440 me 220 v 60 by 1080
it's just it's it's too scrunched yeah
there's a resolution is a little too low
for for the white lights I agree if
you're going on tour y dylai like 34 40
by 1440 for the resolution real estate
we'll go we'll go longer I think for the
first one
