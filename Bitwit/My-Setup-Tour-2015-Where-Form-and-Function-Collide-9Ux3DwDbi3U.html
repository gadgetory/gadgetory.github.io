by IDI from tech source to participate
in his popular death tour series set up
Wars where folks and in pictures of
their sexy desk setups and people vote
on which battle station they feel kicks
the most ass in fact the latest episode
featuring my personal setup is now live
on tech source so go ahead and cruise
over there when you get a moment to see
how I stack up against the competition
also go ahead and subscribe to Ed's
channel while you're there if you want
to see some crazy PC builds and the
plethora of other cool tech videos that
he produces on the wreck it's good stuff
so now that I'm an official special
guest on setup wars I figured I'd give
you guys a dedicated set of tour of my
main desk area I did give you guys an
office tour when I first settled into my
place about a year ago but my setup has
undergone some changes since then so
starting off with the desks themselves
my primary desk that holds all my
peripherals is this room essential
storage desk that I picked up at Target
a few years ago for a measly 85 dollars
it's not the fanciest but it's well
sized for my room looks halfway decent
and gets the job done by the way the
MacBook came included but I left it at
the store because of all the issues that
came included with the MacBook my other
desk is this Parsons model that I
recently got at Big Lots for a hundred
bucks for years I had been using this
cheap folding table to hold up my
desktop that is until I built a new
thousand-pound computer named hotline at
that point I figured it'd be best not to
use a table that's advertised as being
collapsible so I pulled the trigger on
this big guy for an overall cleaner
appearance and peace of mind atop my
primary desk are two 27-inch monitors at
qx2 7/10 2560 by 1440 IPS panel from qyx
and an asus v g2 7 880 144 hertz TN
display at 1920 by 1080 when it comes to
gaming and video editing both of these
displays have served me quite well for
the last few years but I'll admit my new
Nvidia powered gaming PC has me itching
for some g-sync panels so badly that
I've begun applying copious amounts of
hydrocortisone rectally above my asus
monitor is the tried and true Logitech
c920 webcam for streaming and video
chatting my weapons of choice are the
Logitech G 500 games mouse which has
been going strong since 2011
and Corsairs k70 RGB with cherry MX red
switches the sport is definitely one of
today's top choices if you're trying to
glam up the theme for your desk area and
as you can see I've done just that with
a simple two-tone fade that matches my
desktop wallpaper fancy naturally for
any good setup you also need a hardcore
oversized mousepad
after all we're computer geeks not Bros
and mouse pads are the second best thing
to pick up trucks when it comes to
overcompensating so here we have my Oris
thunder p3 which as you can see boasts
quite an impressive length compensated
for sound I use a pair of dt 880 pros
from beyerdynamic that i hang on a hook
behind my desktop more so for me zone
sin in my videos than actual
practicality these pillow-soft open-back
can sound awesome and are absolutely
fantastic for pretty much everything
when it's time to game with the homies i
pair these cans with my antlion mod mic
4.0 which i stick behind my monitor when
not in use
when I'm not using headphones these bose
companion 2 speakers deliver the sound
with some hefty bass in true Bose
fashion if I have one gripe about my
current set-up though it's that my main
desk isn't wide enough to fit the left
speaker forcing me to place it on this
lowly container unit this abhorrent
arrangement has brought shame and
dishonor to my family for many moons
moving on to the right side of the desk
area is my Wonderwall of boxes a modern
marvel that common folk refer to as
trash this modest collection of retail
packaging serves the purpose of adding
some flair to the background of my
videos and quite frankly further
enabling my box hoarding obsession on
the end of the desk I have my DSLR cine
lenses from Rokinon at 24 35 and 85
millimeters that I use to shoot the vast
majority of my videos you're looking
through my 35 millimeter lens right now
they feature a D clicked aperture at a
1.5 f-stop which make them superb in
low-light and easily one of the best
investments I've made for the channel to
date although the prop eyeglasses I
bought for nature tech aren't far behind
and of course what's a good setup
without a fancy-pants tricked-out
computer rocking to 59 60 X and 2 gtx
980ti s in sli my custom water-cooled
gaming pc hotline is as powerful as she
is pretty for weeks after its completion
it has finally made its way to my
primary desk space replacing my old but
still very capable
5820k rig when I began planning the
esthetic blueprint for hot line back in
June it didn't occur to me that it would
later determine the overall theme of my
desk area but after finding a matching
wallpaper and keyboard effect this RGB
LED kit from Ikea was the missing piece
to the puzzle to make my setup truly pop
the kit comes with four rigid LED strips
with the necessary mounting hardware and
a remote control that allows you to fade
between colors or select your own a very
nice accessory that I found through IDI
and his videos on text source so thank
you Ed for exposing the LED accent whore
that I am don't look a bit but that's
pretty much gonna wrap it up for this
here video guys so be sure to subscribe
to tech source so you can keep up with
all of Ed's outstanding tech content as
always some cows awesomesauce Network
thank you guys for watching subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already and
I'll see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
