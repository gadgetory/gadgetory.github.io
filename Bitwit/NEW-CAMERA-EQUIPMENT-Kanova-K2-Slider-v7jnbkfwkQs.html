awesomesauce news so I kind of bought a
bunch of stuff recently to help me
improve the quality of my channel and
i'm not sure what to do with it all yet
because i don't really know how to use
it this is kind of the first time I've
ever really invested this much into
camera equipment before and it's really
not i guess that much that i invested i
only drop maybe well i'm not going to
say how much I spent but regardless I
have some new stuff that I've never
worked with before one of which is a
shoulder rig which I'm really excited to
use but today what I'm here to talk to
you about is this product from canoa
this is the canova to slider let me give
you a fuller look at the box huh this is
this is if this is any indication that i
need a slider I don't know it is so this
is pretty cool like I said I've never
used one of these before so I'm pretty
stoked to try it out so forgive me if
I'm my camera skills with this thing
aren't up to par but it should be pretty
cool so i don't i'm not going to call
this an overview even or review for sure
this is really just the first look and
letting you guys know exactly what i'll
be working with from now on on the
channel so let's let's unbox this thing
so for those of you who don't know what
a camera slider is it's basically a tool
used to achieve a specific kind of shot
in cinematography that looks like this
pretty straightforward right now the sec
nique is not to be confused with panning
where the camera remains stationary and
simply pivots left or right with a
slider the camera can be in constant
motion as it slides across a scene
without ever pivoting however you can
definitely slide and pan simultaneously
if that's the look you're going for and
to be honest I'm really not the best
person to ask about professional camera
equipment all i know is that sliders
make things look badass so I bought one
this one is 39 inches long weighs 8
pounds but supports up to 11 pounds how
does it do that it also features steel
roller bearings that right along a steel
track so movement remains smooth
regardless of orientation there's two
rubber feet on each end that are
adjustable so you can change the slant
and tilt of the slider when using it on
a surface but for my purposes I'll be
mounting it to a tripod most of the time
which gives me a lot more flexibility to
shoot from varying heights and angles in
the center of the rails is a level and
two threads that support quarter inch or
three-eighths inch tripods the same pair
of threads can be found on both ends of
the slider so you have the option to
mounted on two tripods for more
stability there's also a ruler in
centimeters that spans across the rail
to help with positioning and timing the
sliding block has a three-eighths inch
mounting thread for a tripod head which
is what you actually mount the camera on
to it's worth noting that you will need
a compatible tripod head in order to
mount a DSLR to this slider you can
probably find an adapter that lets you
bypass this requirement but it feels so
limiting without a head I'm not sure
you'd want to on the front of the
sliding block is a red knob that locks
it into play so your camera doesn't
accidentally go zipping down the rails
I'm not proud to say that I've already
suffered several heart attacks from
overlooking this feature the resistance
or as I like to call it the slightest of
the slider can be adjusted by removing
the four screws on top of the mounting
block and the tiny retention screw
underneath that I'm constantly terrified
of losing from there you can turn the
middle screw in either direction to
adjust the slightest like I said don't
ask me about this stuff alright guys
that is going to wrap it up for this
unboxing and first look of the konova k2
slider and once again I have no real
experience with sliders so this is kind
of a learning experience for me so if
you guys have any tips or suggestions
and you've worked with a slider like
this before
or go ahead and send me a comment in the
section below and I'll be sure to read
them and find out more about what I can
possibly do with this thing so thank you
