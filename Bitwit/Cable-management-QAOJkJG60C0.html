new house now we still have a lot of
unpacking to do unfortunately things are
still in boxes all over the countertops
and so forth but every day we do
probably a dozen to two dozen little
things to make this place feel closer to
home this is one of those days so if
you're someone climbed you get to follow
me around while I do stuff around the
house super exciting I'm really just
doing a bunch of little chores around
the house today they're all little
things for the most part but they're
important things and if you're so
inclined follow me and we'll do some
chores I didn't make that sound very
exciting so the first thing I got to
take care of are these office desks so
this is why he sauces desk and that's my
best and we actually had some really
nice IKEA desks at the last studio but
they were too big and bulky to fit here
so we actually gave them away so we're
left with these very skinny kind of
slender but sleek looking minimalistic
tables that are also from Ikea these are
the the DIY one through you by the legs
and the tabletop separately in case you
were wondering but the problem with
these desks then you've got like heavy
computers and stuff on them with
monitors they're very wobbly so that's
not gonna fly for us we're gonna have to
reinforce them today I got a couple
l-brackets we're actually gonna be using
two per table fixing them to the wall
don't mind cable management and
hopefully that'll make them more secure
and more comfortable to work at and for
whatever reason if these l-brackets
aren't quite enough and the tables are
still a little wobbly even against the
wall and might get some brackets to
mount these tables together and that
should definitely do the trick but for
now let's install these guys
all right so the wipes desk is done got
the two bars installed no problem I had
to find the studs first using my handy
dandy stud buddy
you know us studs like to stick together
found out there about 16 inches apart
which is pretty standard and then man
are these suckers straight to the studs
that's stuff I can help it with
reinforcement and check this out so this
is my desk still completely loose two
fingers two finger wobble look at that
so that's how bad it was before and this
is the wife's desk same test the only
thing you're seeing shaking is my camera
right now but it's I can shake it just a
very slight bit nothing going nowhere
that's actually really good that means I
don't have to fix these tables together
after all because it's plenty stable as
is merging these desks would have posed
an issue of its own because I kind of
forgot that we have to follow where the
studs go obviously and they just don't
line up with both of these desks
touching so there is gonna be a couple
inch gap to be two or three inches
they're not a big deal but everything
else is looking pretty good so without
further ado let's do my desk now all
right
both desks are stable Oh wifey Sasa sell
them quick wife test all right she
doesn't wanna be on camera she can do
her face today get the desk a little
wobble no more wobbly I can't film your
face at all there's just your butt so
take your pick and your boobs you can
see I also left a gap behind the desks
for cable routing and stuff what do you
think's good moving on
alright we've got a couple things here
we have these headphone anchors just to
make our desks a little bit more
functional because they're pretty bare
so I'm gonna mount two of these one on
each desk for wifey and I these are the
exact same anchors that we used for the
last office we liked them so much that
we bought them again I think that's the
brand-name app home I don't know it's
some Chinese brand they're really good
quality aluminum construction they come
in different colors adhesive as well as
mounting screw options so I'll put links
are all this stuff in the description
below in case you're interested
wifey sauce is also getting this little
train thing for pens and pencils and
erasers and stuff I can't ask for the
quality of this thing we just bought
on a whim it's got adhesive only so I'll
probably mount that I don't know over
here and then the hook over the left
whatever I'll figure it out so that
cutaway was a little shorter than
expected while the headphone hooks look
great and they're holding up nicely I
did not get around to mounting the
pencil holder because wifey sauce told
me not to she took a look at it for the
first time in person and said that's too
small probably because she knows saying
it to me won't change anything so that's
one less thing we have to do right now
let's move on dude what are these boxes
that came in today I completely forget
because we've been ordering so many
things for the house let's open them
they're not as heavy as they look what
are you show yourself business Oh office
chair mats sweet
so the mats are pretty basic but they
look good seem decent quality and stuff
I really like how the the wheels of the
chair roll on them adds a bit of
friction so that's nice
CCI oriented the mats portrait mode for
lack of a better term as opposed to
landscape I know it doesn't look quite
as nice but it just seems to make more
sense to me the mats are a little bit on
the small side they're a bit smaller
than I thought but I just figured that
when you're in an office chair you tend
to move your chair up and down or back
and forth as opposed to side-to-side so
to me it makes more sense to have them
oriented this way but I do prefer the
way they look the other way so I might
have to have wife√≠s us come in here and
make the final call and she usually does
all right who's ready for some cable
management
adhesive cable ties what a difference
these little guys make now obviously I'm
not trying to win any set of contests or
anything but functionally this is a lot
better a lot nicer it's gonna keep
things out of the way you're not gonna
get snagged on your feet through your
legs while you're working and it does
look infinitely better even though you
can still visibly see cables you know
underneath the desk it's a definitely
cleared up a lot from what it was
looking a little loose right here I'll
probably just tell you that up really
quick the only cables I have not managed
yet are the ethernet cables for both of
our computers simply because I'm still
setting up internet that's its own thing
its own video entirely so more on that
later
all right we've switched gears to the
shooting room and this is the last thing
I'll probably get around to doing
tonight which is setting up the awesome
Hardware live streaming area so you can
see I've already got the peripherals
hooked up although we do still need a
mouse but we got the dual monitors here
and keyboard we even have our stream
deck that I finally hooked up pretty
snazzy sound boards over here but Shh
frickin chair but you can see none of
this stuff is actually plugged in let
alone does it have a PC to connect to so
I have to go dig up the streaming PC
that we use at the old set get
everything connected get Internet which
I don't know exactly how to do I have
like a fifty or a hundred foot Ethernet
cable which I could use just you know
just route it really quick and dirty
because the live stream is tomorrow it's
Monday today sorry I didn't mention that
the Paul's coming here tomorrow so we
need to have internet on this system so
I could either just run you know
haphazardly along cable or I could use
these Ethernet powerline adapters which
are hit or miss sometimes they work
beautifully other times they really have
degradation performance depending on the
circuitry in your home so we're gonna
hook everything up and then do some
light testing to make sure everything's
running smoothly for tomorrow before
calling it
okay I actually tracked down the system
it was buried under a bunch of other
systems but here it is the streaming pc
for awesome hardware ID still got oh
gosh I totally forget if this is the ten
core or twelve core sky like X so it's
either the 7900 X or the 79 xx x and I
just swapped out the RX Vega 64 with a
Radeon seven because it's newer it's
faster and hey it's not collecting dust
anymore but it's a good use so yeah the
only thing about this that you're not
gonna like and especially Paul when he
gets here tomorrow is that the PC is on
the floor and I don't really have a good
place to put it elsewhere like it's not
gonna fit in this little corner like the
evolve shift back there barely fits so I
think maybe I'll get like at least one
of those tiny like stools on wheels to
put the computer on and that'll at least
alleviate some of the dust build up over
time but in the meantime with this
limited space we have this solution is
gonna have to work for now
all righty
our little control center and livestream
area is all set up we do have internet
the powerline Ethernet adapter is
working just fine however I have not
verified the speeds so why don't we do a
quick test do a quick test to see if
it's actually adequate to run the live
show so fortunately we are in the room
next door to the router Oh download
speeds not looking so hot ooh yikes come
back it's coming back all right okay not
great but certainly workable and then
obviously upload is the more important
one here for streaming and that's
looking pretty nice actually as long as
we don't drop out at the last second I
think we're good 64 35 and 64 all right
so since I'm not going to be doing much
downloading on this system it's kind of
a moot point I'm really glad the upload
speed is where it is though because that
is more than adequate for the live show
especially for just streaming at 1080p
60 frames per second all right guys I
think I'm gonna cut the video up here
because it's in the late wife your sauce
wants me to go to bed and stuff you know
how that is thank you guys for joining
me on this little endeavor it was fun
Oh bless you she sneezed ruin my video
sorry it's not gonna fix my video anyway
I know what I did today probably doesn't
look like it took a lot of time because
everything's time-lapse on camera but it
really did all these little things add
up and tomorrow is a new day with a
whole new list of chores for me to do as
well as my Vsauce but it's fun you know
seeing the house being put together bit
by bit is definitely rewarding and
exciting experience hopefully you guys
enjoyed watching it today he did toss a
like on it and let me know your thoughts
