welcome back to the channel hope you're
doing well I would like to start this
video off by introducing you to LG's
nano Cell TV I like PC gaming on this TV
very much which is something I've never
said about any TV ever until now I
enjoyed my gaming experience on this
thing so much in fact that when I
visited the products marketing page to
learn more about its gaming prowess I
was shocked to find no mention of the
LCDs gaming capabilities but rather a
laundry list of other features what
could possibly deserve more attention
than being the holy grail of gaming TVs
with this thing make me breakfast clean
the house and guilt-trip me about it
later maybe I mean I already have a one
clearly LG is whipped up something
special for its 3rd generation of super
UHD TVs something I'm just too curious
about not to investigate further before
circling back to gaming as the name
suggests it all boils down to LG's new
nano cell LCDs which use uniformly sized
particles approximately one nanometer in
diameter the end result is improved
color gamut and a significant reduction
of color distortion at sharp viewing
angles I can confirm not only are the
colors rich and precise but their
accuracy is maintained remarkably well
from virtually any seat in the house
this is what I called the Rob Lowe
effect where there are no bad angles LG
cleverly demoed the feature by having
two competing pro soccer players take
aim at a section of the screen from a 60
degree angle 1 a conventional LCD the
other sporting nano cell technology you
can guess how the story ends but I'll
drop a link below if you'd like to watch
two dudes compete in a game of scaled
ball fondling overall the picture
quality on this unit is excellent it
while its blacks are no match for LG's
OLED panel even appearing slightly gray
at times nano cell delivers incredibly
crisp 4k images that are sure to WoW the
masses as well as the enthusiast gamer
this IPS beauty also shipped
Dolby vision and active HDR for
producing richer highlights and an
automatic color boost whenever you feed
the TV HDR content the webOS 3.5
implementation is awesome and will
likely eliminate the common plebs need
for something like an HTP see the
software sports a clean UI with a
sensible layout that pairs nicely with
the ergonomic Magic Remote for intuitive
navigation dedicated Netflix and Amazon
buttons bring premium content right to
your fingertips and a voice command
button lets you boss your TV around
presumably like a boss I was skeptical
at first of the remotes mouse-like
cursor but my fears quickly subsided
with its pinpoint accuracy and
responsiveness I'm also a big fan of the
clickable scroll wheel is that a number
on switch in there no it's definitely
now while I plan to eventually connect a
sound bar the unit comes equipped with
Harman Kardon speakers which sound good
for built-in drivers but our overall
nothing to write home about
the speakers are housed inside of a
beautiful frame measuring just 6.9
millimeters deep at its thinnest point
with super thin bezels all around and a
gorgeous stand that I think trumps LG's
OLED models of course there's also a
base mount in the back if you wish to
float this guy off the wall as for IO
you get three USB and four HDMI to drive
4k at 60 Hertz though some DisplayPort
connectivity would have been the cherry
on top now all the features I've covered
up until this point are no doubt
impressive but to hell with all of them
let's talk about gaming notice when
switching between picture modes the
image quickly changes from profile to
profile but the second we entered game
mode the screen goes black for a moment
meaning more than just a glorified
filtration process has taken place in
game mode the TV enters a lowered input
lag state that are teams.com found to
hover at just 15 milliseconds ik waiting
to less than a 1 frame delay to put
things in perspective several of the top
gaming TV articles I found are praising
units with 20 to 30 milliseconds of
input lag at 15 milliseconds my filthy
casual eyes can't even tell this TV from
a high-end gaming monitor fast paced
shooters like csgo and doom are
incredibly responsive and fun to play on
the big screen when your physical
movements and the screens output are
synced in perfect harmony fortunately I
didn't notice any excess of motion blur
either so visuals remains sharp and
focused even in the most frantic of
character movements finally as it turns
out the units
Hance t ewing angles don't just benefit
media playback but insures anyone
joining you for a local co-op adventure
has a great view as well there really
isn't much this 55 inch piece of 4k
glass won't do to convince you that
ultra wide monitors still have some
competition in the realm of immersive
gaming input lag has always been the
deal-breaker for having a battle station
in the living room but TVs like this are
making that dream a reality the reality
I would very much like to enjoy right
