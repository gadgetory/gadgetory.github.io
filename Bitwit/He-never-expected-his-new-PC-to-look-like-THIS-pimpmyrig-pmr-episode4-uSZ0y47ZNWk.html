rig new episode it's been too long with
CES and the holidays I'm glad we're
finally bringing the series back so
today we've got yet another system from
yet another longtime fan of the channel
his name is Andrew
apart from being a fan of the channel
andrew is also a loving husband and a
stay-at-home dad helping to raise his
cute little baby beautiful family I
actually had the privilege of meeting
them the other week when they dropped
the system off but not all has been rosy
for Andrew not too long ago he was
diagnosed with depression something that
he always kind of knew in the back of
his mind that he had but it wasn't
officially confirmed by doctors until
recently and it's something he's been
struggling with for a lot longer than
the date he got diagnosed and since his
diagnosis he actually decided to turn to
PC gaming and twitch streaming in fact
who serve as a positive outlet as a way
to connect with other gamers to talk
about his mental health so I'm already
feeling inspired as we go about
upgrading this system today in hopes
that the end result will give Andrew
more tools at his disposal to really
start connecting more with the twitch
community the gaming community and to
really spread positivity in that area so
that's what we're doing today and while
I have a very soft spot for Andrew
because I personally deal with mental
illness in my own family on a regular
basis I'm not gonna hold back any
punches when it comes to roasting the
heck out of his rig here look at this
old crusty machine
it sounds like an insult you would hurl
at a senior citizen the old crusty
machine that's an old person saying it
too maybe to another old person I'm
really bad at roasting anyway you guys
probably can't see very well right here
because this is a cube style chassis so
I think I'm gonna do this roast blog
style yeah we're gonna do that so let's
first care this thing apart figuratively
before tearing it apart literally yes
that checks out so we've got the core
v21 from thermal tank this is actually
not a bad Oh as I say that there's
actually a pretty decent budget micro
ATX case if you don't mind the cube
shape that's that it's definitely
showing signs of age the design language
is clearly outdated and overall I'm just
kind of itching for a new look so we'll
see what we can do there but for the
love of God if you're gonna buy a case
with a side panel window at least make
sure that there's something worth
looking at behind it I mean come on what
is it a haystack in there good lord I
don't want to open this thing but alas I
must it is the process okay so that's
right there it's acrylic by the way
that's probably not scratch the top
panel off and oh oh oh the horror
did you drop a hot dog in here well yeah
that ketchup and mustard this isn't a
computer it's a condiment dispenser not
to knock the gtx 750ti or anything but
just look at how small it is in this
case like I mean the video card is
basically the penis of a computer and
right now no female systems are
impressed wait what is this what did you
did you seriously leave the plastic on
the graphics card before you installed
oh my look at that what is this here we
have an elgato hd60 Pro I'm not gonna
knock you for that it's actually a
fairly decent card I think it can do
1080 60 as indicated by the HD 60 we
have a gigabyte motherboard which looks
like it's be 450 MDS 3h not a bad budget
option Verizon 520 600 and here is a
fantastic ship I'll give them that
6 cores 12 threads really good price to
performance there but the race stuff
cooler it's just it's got a go man yeah
basic yeah basic we've got 16 gigs of
DDR 4 from little G scale a G scale
Aegeus how fast is this stuff how fast
what did he get 3,000 for Rison shame on
you Andrew you should have gotten at
least 3200 everyone knows that no three
thousands not bad but I would recommend
at least 32 hundred speed kit and then
potentially try to overclock from there
we'll see what we can do in the RAM
Department later on oh jeez this is just
sad don't you have a kid and here this
is a safety hazard they could they could
drown in this a power supplies us anyway
oh wait I see a label power supply what
the hell is power spec so I looked at
Andrews email and he did confirm the
power spec is actually a Micro Center
in-house brand didn't even know they had
one this is apparently a 550 watt you
know 80 plus certified but we're not
exactly sure what rating that is we'll
have to pull it out and take a closer
look that's what you said we can't
really see it but apparently there's
also a power spec assess D in here 480
gigs which is the only drive he has in
here I think Andrew did mention when I
saw him that he's got an external hard
drive hooked up but that's that's that's
like anakata back what if someone trips
on the USB cable while you're in the
middle of a boss fight huh then what
that one are gonna do alright so not the
absolute worst build I've ever seen in
my life but there's certainly room for
improvement here so we've got a lot of
work to do guys let's bring out the
first round of upgrades so the first
thing we're upgrading is Andrews memory
kit 16 gigabytes is a fair capacity for
what entries trying to do with this
machine
but the 3,000 megahertz speed was just a
little too slow for my liking when
you're talking about a rising platform
so we're upgrading him to this 3200
speed kit of Oris RGB memory not only is
this gonna be much faster especially
with those high
Samson bee dies but these modules also
feature customizable RGB lighting which
will look way better in his system than
the current g.skill age escape so we're
gonna make sure that he loves the way
this build looks as much as he loves the
way it performs speaking of performance
I thought what the hell
why don't we upgrade his already very
good Rison 520 600 to an even better
Rison 720 700 X with 8 cores and 16
threads this will definitely give him
some greater gaming and streaming
capabilities and editing as well if he
happens to be editing any of his twitch
highlights for example he'll be much
better suited and well equipped for the
job so I think we should gut the system
give it a nice little cleaning install
these parts into the motherboard I think
that'd be 450 board is just fine and
then we'll take it from there
3 2 1 go
clearly I forgot to point out that this
kit this or sRGB memory kit actually
includes two dummy sticks you get four
sticks only two of them are active the
other two are pretty much dead sticks
but all four of them have the RGB
implementation they're all supporting
RGB fusion filling up those empty DIMM
slots really completes the look of the
system and you know having four of those
sticks with all the RGB it's gonna look
really nice
our 2700 x loaded and just fine there
isn't he looking pretty let's move on to
some of the other things I'm just gonna
do it free handed here so we've got the
original core V 21 case here from
Thermaltake which again like I said is
is a great case for what it is but also
showing signs of age little outdated
looking so we're upgrading to the
spiritual successor also from thermal
tag this is their level 20 VT which
almost uses the exact same internal
layout I don't know if you can tell
through the tempered glass window but
the internal layout is almost identical
with a couple minor tweaks the biggest
change here is the outside aesthetics
you can just see from old to new is like
a 10-year challenge right here you get
tempered glass on four sides one two
three and four so you can see pretty
much every angle of the build no matter
where you are it's also great that these
cases are the exact same dimensions
because it guarantees when Andrew brings
the new system home it'll fit perfectly
in place of where the old rig was there
are a couple notable changes on the
interior however for example you've got
these three SSD trays very convenient to
have right there on the side but the
case does retain its water cooling
support for radiators up to 280
millimeters now since our CPU requires
more cooling we're in an upgrade to rate
stealth to the thermal tech flow ring
240 liquid a I oh by the way I should
have mentioned this video is sponsored
by thermal takes so huge thanks to them
for providing all of this amazing
hardware for Andrews build and as always
you guys can find links to all this
stuff in the description but we've got
these awesome ring plus RGB fans you've
got 12 LEDs around them addressable RGB
values on the fans and the waterblock
can easily sync with other supportive
devices we've got native am4 supports
but most importantly this units gonna do
a great job of keeping our 2700 necks
cool while we overclock it and looking
fancy at the same time our RGB is really
starting to come together but it's not
quite there yet we're gonna have to
employ the help of a couple other ring
plus fans we've got a 14 millimeter I'm
sorry hundred and 40 millimeter fan here
as well as a 200 millimeter fan that's
gonna go at the front now this case
already includes the 200 millimeter fan
at the front but it is not RGB it's just
a regular black fan so we're gonna bling
that out and the 140 is gonna go at the
back exhaust and that is all we've got
for now so let's go ahead and get
building inside
the brand-new case and we'll circle back
in a moment
all right things lookin pretty good down
there hanging in there buddy okay more
on that in just a moment we've got some
some other parts here this is our last
wave of hardware before we get to show
off the finished build in all of its
glory so I wanted to swap out his
existing power supply just didn't seem
like it was gonna cut it for the
hardware that we're putting in here
we're bearing more towards a high-end
build now so I wanted to have the extra
reliability and power to boot so here we
have thermal take stuff power I RGB plus
750 watts so that puts us up from 550
and we have 80 plus gold certified which
is probably more efficient than what he
was rocking before now we do have an
addressable RGB fan built into the unit
but I'm wondering how much we're gonna
be able to appreciate that once it's
installed we'll just have to wait and
see well I'm sure the stock cables in
here look just fine we're gonna upgrade
the look a bit further with the TT mod
slave cable extension set this is a
combo pack with black and white sleeves
very color neutral should reflect some
of the RGB lighting very nicely very
excited to pop these in and over here
you can see I'm dropping in a 2 terabyte
WD black sorry I should have removed
this first it's all reflective and stuff
WD black 2 terabyte I'd like him to have
everything internally and not have to
lug around an external hard drive or
anything like that of course that's
gonna be paired with his existing SSD
we're not swapping this out this has his
operating system on into it this
personal files but wait Kyle that can't
be it you couldn't possibly just be
leaving him with his old ZOTAC mini gt x
1050 TI could you well of course I
couldn't and my initial plan was to get
him in RTX 2070 duke from msi was
actually the same card that I used in my
CES build but I left that card at home
today and I do not have time to go back
and get it so unfortunately I'm sorry
Andrew I can't use that graphics card
for your build I'm gonna have to use the
backup which I hope you're ok with it's
the r-tx 2080 from gigabyte this is
their gaming OSI model I hope you're ok
with this this last-minute change the
best I could do
alright so the cats out of the bag these
are all the parts that we're using for
Andrews upgraded rig I think the last
mystery of the day is what the system
will look like when it's finally done
and powered on it's question I'd very
much like to answer right now
the build is complete and it looks so
awesome yeah oh man oh man I am killing
it actually I am not killing it in fact
I'm screwing things up royally as usual
because let me tell you what you guys
probably already noticed this at the
hd60 pro the internal capture card that
andrew is using to stream is no longer
in the system it's not in here because
there's no more room for it basically
what happened is when I upgraded the
r-tx 2072 the r-tx 2080 I overlooked the
fact that it's actually a slightly
thicker card covering up the bottom PCIe
slot preventing us from dropping this in
the build so it's uh yeah it's my fault
you can't stream anymore Andrea's just
it sucks no I'm just kidding I'm
actually gonna send them home with my
own razor ripsaw external capture card
which even does 4k capturing which is
external and it's it's probably it is
less convenient in a sense but at the
same time
RTX 20 80 Hey so you know you're
sacrificing a bit of convenience there
but getting a much faster GPU so I don't
know too many people who wouldn't take
that trick but let's not forget at the
end of the day the moral story here is
that I'm stupid moving on though hey
really good air moving through this case
you can definitely feel it from that 200
millimeter fan at the front the steel
inside is is quite cool to the touch
that's always a good sign cable
management in this chassis was a bit of
a challenge it took me a little bit more
time just to get everything clean and
organized mainly because there are no
like cover like vanity panels right here
to like cover up the power supply shroud
so you just see right into there which
isn't a bad thing it just means you have
to spend a little bit of extra time to
tidy things up so I did take me a little
bit longer than expected
sadly the full RGB effect of our RGB
power supply cannot be appreciated it's
not quite visible however if you go to
the back of the system you can kind of
see it it's it's doing it's giving you a
little tease there you also get a little
sneak peek on the right side of the case
there so hooray for tempered glass
apart from that though this was a super
smooth build that I'm really happy with
how it turned out again links to all
this stuff can be found in the
description below without further ado
ladies and gents it's about time we show
this rig to its rightful owner I can't
wait to see Andrews reaction even if
it's not explosive he might be a bit
more reserved or camera shy but I hope
when he sees it for the first time he
begin
screaming bloody murder internally
that's all I can hope for really so on
that note let's show them is Rick all
right we got you we snagged Andrew we
brought them in here we lured him into
our little cave what's going through
your mind right now I'm concerned that
I'm gonna need my sunglasses my cry so
did you actually bring sunglasses and
the next repair depends do you have any
expectations for the build the biggest
thing I'm looking forward to table
management that's something I never had
and you know I want to look nice so it
could be the same system just manage and
I'll be ecstatic all right sounds good
man well I guess I guess this is it I'm
gonna I'm gonna show you your new job
Andrew here is your new PC Oh
oh my god take a minute to just reel it
all in oh my god I'm like shaking oh my
god that looks amazing
not only does it look nicer we've also
made some upgrades performance wise so
we actually upgraded your graphics card
which is pretty evident aesthetically
that's that's actually an RT X 2080
from giggling yeah like the other thing
we upgraded that was pretty substantial
was the CPU I mean the horizon 520 600
is already a fantastic chip but since
you're gonna be using this for gaming
and streaming we felt it was only right
that you have at least eight cores and
16 threads so we have graded you to a
Rison 720 700 X but you can get a pretty
decent overclock on that dude oh my god
I think I need to go get my pants like
seriously like I'm I got nothing like
really in that in a good way like it's
just incredible like I never thought I'd
see something like this on my desk you
know as soon as I get at home and
thermaltake also threw in their level 20
RGB keyboard and their mouse so these
are genuine Cherry MX silver speed
switches fantastic keyboard this is the
titanium Edition USB pass-through and
all that so Thermaltake really tried to
hook you up for all right I'm ecstatic I
can't wait to get home I'm glad that you
really like it and I expect you to do
great things with it what's the name of
your twitch channel by the way beard Lee
Andrew beard Lee Andrew I'll throw it up
on screen guys feel free to subscribe to
beard Leandre on Twitch congratulate him
on his new rig pop in for some streams
see what he's all about
all right
guys that's gonna do it for now thanks
so much for watching toss a like on this
video if you enjoyed it and get
subscribed for more tech stuff coming at
you really really soon we're gonna go
drool over this PC some more okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
