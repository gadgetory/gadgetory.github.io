events yesterday I discovered that there
was something odd about the benchmarks
in last week's showdown between the gtx
1060 and our X 480 they were wrong
that's right last week I got up here in
front of this camera and openly lied to
all of your faces unintentionally of
course you see to my knowledge the
results in last week's video were
completely 100% accurate otherwise I
wouldn't have made them public I did
think some of the results seemed strange
at the time and for those I reran the
tests again and again and wound up with
these same results so I confided in the
data as reviewers often do then
yesterday I was in the midst of
benchmarking this custom our X 480 from
power color which meant I was also
retesting the reference rx 480 and gtx
1060 since it would be their first time
on my new 6950 x testbed well as it
turns out the numbers for both cards
were significantly different from the
ones I documented just a week prior
particularly the gtx 1060 scores seeing
a tremendous performance boost of up to
40% in certain titles and 68% in 3dmark
times by what huh yeah I seriously wish
I could explain how or why this happened
but it's kind of difficult to
investigate where the issue originated
when my old testbed has essentially been
scrapped away for this new one sure it's
fitted with a different CPU motherboard
and RAM but there's no way those swaps
alone would have made such a
catastrophic difference in our cards
gaming performance the 69 50 X is even
clocked slightly lower than my 5820k was
all I can think up for now is that the
previous testbed had some bad or
corrupted graphics drivers that were
making the cards tank harder than diba
on a payload whatever the reason may be
I can now confirm that the results from
last week's video are in fact inaccurate
and I deeply apologize for any confusion
they may have caused when I stumbled
upon this discovery I immediately
notified you guys on Twitter and started
to retest all 12 benchmark titles
needless to say the fight between the
gtx 1060 and the RX 480 is far from over
hell it hasn't even begun yet so
consider today's video the official
showdown of these mid-range cards both
GPUs are using the latest drivers and
same manual overclocks as the last video
likewise all the same games are being
run at identical quality settings the
only thing that's really changed here is
the testbed hardware and the absence of
some really corrupt variable to fudge up
our numbers so for what it's worth
and hopefully the last time we'll have
to see them for a while here are the
benchmarks again
so if you remember correctly some of
these results haven't moved much since
last week while others have changed
significantly to give us an overall
picture I added up all the frames
generated by each card at 1920 by 1080
and 2560 by 1440 then took the averages
to see how they stacked up at the two
resolutions the gtx 1060 leads across
the board by 10% at full HD and around
7% at the higher resolution flexing its
speed over the RX 480
next I totaled up all the frames in our
testing and sorted them by API in order
to depicts DirectX 11 versus DirectX 12
performance again Nvidia takes home a
victory point with a 14% lead in DirectX
11 but our rx 480 barely edges out its
rival by half a percent in DirectX 12
now it's definitely not the landslide
victory that we saw in last week's video
but it still demonstrates the benefits
of Polaris's hardware level support for
acing compute engines at the start of
this video I have expected that all of
this new and accurate data would lead me
to draw drastically different
conclusions about these two cards but
after seeing the legitimate numbers I
stand by my initial claim that the gtx
1060 is the faster GPU overall
especially with DirectX 11 still
dominating the mainstream likewise it's
only a matter of time before DirectX 12
and Vulcan eclipsed the older API and at
that point a and B could have the upper
hand with asynchronous compute hardwired
in Pascal would be in a tough spot
relying heavily on software and drivers
to get the job done which is really only
half the battle
future proofing is definitely something
to consider here but if your main focus
is on the present today we've seen these
cards really trade blows in a wide range
of titles with the gtx 1060 taking home
larger winnings but at a higher price
that is gonna wrap it up for now guys
but let me know whether today's
benchmarks have swayed your stance on
this heated rivalry of the two GPUs and
don't forget to toss me a like on this
video if you enjoyed it keep going come
