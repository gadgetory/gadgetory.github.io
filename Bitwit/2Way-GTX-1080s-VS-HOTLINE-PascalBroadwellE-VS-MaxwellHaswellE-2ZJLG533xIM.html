watching the channel for more than a
year or so you're probably familiar with
hotlines my custom water-cooled gaming
PC sporting the best hardware for its
time the core i7 59 60 X and 2 gtx 980ti
but when it comes to the diehard
enthusiast community most of us know
that certain PC parts like CPUs and GPUs
typically have a short reign before
they're killed up for better Hardware a
longtime trend in the PC market that I'm
sure gives george RR martin a throbbing
gristle my point is that since the
arrival of Broadwell ian pascal my
custom rig now seems more outdated than
the drivers on your parent's pc now I
may be exaggerating just a tad but all
this new hardware made me extremely
curious to know exactly what difference
in gaming performance one generational
leap makes so to find out i've pitted my
x99 testbed equipped with Intel's 10
core 69 50 X and two GTX 1080s in sli
against hotline the previous title
holder for fastest PC in Kyle's house
sorry pal here's an overall look at the
hardware from each contender running on
the x99 chipset with 16 gigs of ram both
CPUs and video cards have been manually
overclocked and will likely have the
greatest impact on performance with
viagra coming in at a close second now I
did want to mention that these
benchmarks were run before I had access
to a high bandwidth sli bridge so I used
a rigid dual finger bridge on the GTX
1080s instead while I haven't tested
this for myself a well done video from
hardware unboxed found that using to
flex sli bridges on to a gtx 1080s
yields the exact same performance gains
found with the new high bandwidth bridge
so there's a good chance my rigid
connector is more than adequate with
that said each system has undergone a
series of crushing 4k benchmarks along
with some synthetic tests but before we
see how they've scored here's a quick
look at Mac's system power draw with our
new PC hitting 541 watts and hotline
spiking to 718 now maximum power draw
doesn't reflect the average power
consumption of these systems but it does
provide at least a small glimpse of the
power efficiency improvements we're
seeing over the maximal architecture
good-for-you pascal and 3d mark fire
strike ultra the new system pulls ahead
by a large margin
topping 10,000 points in both the
overall and graphics score meanwhile hot
line here looks sluggish in comparison
performing 27% slower than the
competition our test bed takes the lead
once again in Unigine Heaven albeit by a
smaller margin this time seeing a
percent increase over hotline this was
the most neck-and-neck our systems got
throughout our testing in gta5 we see
some mad gains with the Pascal based PC
pumping out 16 more frames per second
making it 31 percent faster in this
particular title
even though hot line managed to score a
higher minimum frame rate in hitman the
beatings continue like the end of a
peaceful protest with a 26 percent lead
for the GTX 1080s
resulting in 77 frames compared to this
piece of just barely topping 60 FPS
with the settings more or less maxed out
the testbed churns out a whopping eighty
seven frames per second in Metro last
light not only is this an impressive 22
percent gain over hotline it's also just
nice to see a system deliver well above
60 fps at 4k our final game tested was
Crysis 3 and as we saw in Metro last
light the new system performed 22%
faster topping 70 FPS with an impressive
minimum frame rate of 53 averaging the
scores of all the real world games
tested today our new PC was 25% faster
than hotline well I have seen more
devastating leads like the ones in the
new Ghostbusters movie I hinted earlier
that these results really bring home the
possibility of triple-a 4k gaming at max
settings something I've really never
been able to do comfortably even with
hotline of course all these extra games
come at a price don't they
so when calculating the frames per
dollar of each rig I only included the
cost of the CPUs and GPUs since again
those parts have the greatest impact on
our gaming performance with the cheapest
GTX 10 80s priced online at six hundred
and fifty dollars and the 69 50 X
carrying an insane price tag of sixteen
hundred and fifty our testbed managed
0.18 frames per dollar in our testing
with the gtx 980ti priced as low as 480
dollars and the 59 60 X at 1015 Hotline
scored an F PD of 0.23 a better value
than the new rig by about 28% certainly
the extreme cost of the new 10 core chip
is what's holding back the price to
performance of this system and while it
does kick the 59 60 X's ass in certain
workstation tasks its impact on gaming
performance alone is likely not worth
the extra go for most people's budgets
if you happen to be upgrading from a
last gen monster like hotline it makes
much more sense to keep the CPU and swap
out the video cards for some gtx 1080s
for example which will do most of the
heavy lifting and handle pretty much
anything you throw at it metaphorically
speaking personally I don't think I'll
be upgrading hotline to the latest
hardware anytime soon
since she still dominates every game on
my quad HD monitor back there but it is
nice to know what kind of experience I
can expect if I ever take the plunge
that is gonna do it for now guys so let
me know what you think of these results
