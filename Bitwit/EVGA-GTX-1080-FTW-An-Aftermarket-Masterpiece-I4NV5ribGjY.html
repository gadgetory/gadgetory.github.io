at the first of hopefully many custom
gtx 1080s on the channel
this is EVGA gtx 1080 for the win
edition and it comes bearing loads of
improvements over in videos reference
design I mean just look at the two
side-by-side which one would you want
inside of your slot in regards to EVGA
z' own product stack before the win
edition ranks above the superclocked
version and just below the classified
model in terms of feature set and
factory OC intensity so we can expect
the price and out-of-the-box performance
of this card to fall somewhere between
the two on the base clock of our full GP
104 GPU we see an aftermarket bump to
seventeen hundred and twenty-one
megahertz
with a boost clock of eighteen hundred
and sixty megahertz after some GPU boost
3.0 magic the card managed to press on
and hit nineteen hundred and eighty
seven megahertz or about two hundred and
fifty megahertz higher than the
reference boost clock the memory clock
stays unchanged at ten gigahertz
affective being a gtx 1080 we get eight
gigs of gddr5 X on a 256 bit bus along
with the full number of twenty 560 CUDA
cores with the arrival of Pascal we see
a completely revamped cooler from EVGA
aptly named a CH 3.0 the cooler spans
ten and a half inches long and features
two 100 millimeter fans that use double
ball bearings to increase their lifespan
up to four times longer than the
competition which means they'll probably
outlive most musicians these days to
keep acoustics in check the fans stay
put when the system remains in a
low-power state only ramping up when the
GPU begins to generate more heat the
swept fan blades move air downward onto
a hefty fin stack using six
nickel-plated heat pipes four of which
are six millimeter and the other two
eight millimeters thick the black
plastic shroud sports an interesting
combination of brush metallic plating
and a honeycomb mesh I personally love
the new look and I commend EB GA for
being the first company to hire a colony
of bees to design their cooler the build
quality here is second to none and the
mesh pattern is backlit with RGB
lighting configurable in the latest
precision X software branding on the
side also gets the RGB treatment and
lighting effects for all LEDs on the
card includes static color cycling and
breathing mode though I couldn't get the
breathing effect to work in my testing
behold the breath holding effect
sorry that was horrible still the RGB
lighting on the GTX 1084 the win is
among the best I've seen on any graphics
card to date the colors are accurate and
vibrant and produce an even glow with no
visible hot spots the lights can also be
disabled for all of you joyless
fuddy-duddies beside the illuminated
logo we see EVGA has added an extra 8
pin PCIe plug over the founder's
addition giving us 2 in total with a max
total graphics power draw of 258 watts
to further aid power delivery they've
also doubled down with a custom 10 plus
to power phase design over the reference
5 plus one solution assuming you don't
draw the short straw on the silicon
lottery these welcome changes should
theoretically improve the cards
overclocking performance and stability
while it's easily missed the custom PCB
also features a dual BIOS switch next to
the power plugs on the back we find a
beautiful brushed metallic backlight
with some more of that fun honeycomb
mesh it's hard to quantify how much
exactly this reinforces the circuit
board but when a backplate looks this
good who even cares
finally the rear sports the reference
layout of display i/o with one dual link
DVI 3 DisplayPort 1.4 and a single HDMI
2.0 be for testing I ran the card on my
x99 test bedrock into 5820k at 4400
megahertz with 16 gigs of DDR 4 on a
gigabyte x99 gaming g1 Wi-Fi when
overclocking the card I was only able to
squeeze another 50 or 60 megahertz out
of the GPU clock dude was already being
pushed pretty heavily by EVGA one could
go so far as to say that overclocking
this card is kind of like forcing a
heroin junkie to smoke weed he's already
so high that there's little room to push
him further without experiencing total
instability as a result today's numbers
will showcase the cards factory
overclocked performance 3d mark fire
strike extreme being an exception where
I show stock and OC results in order to
illustrate the slight gains achieved
when overclocking the card throughout my
testing the chip stayed moderately cool
never topping 76 degrees Celsius the ACX
3.0 cooler kept quiet as well here's a
listen
all games were run at 1920 by 1080 2560
by 1440 and 4k on Windows 10 using the
latest 360 8.39 wickel driver from
nvidia on that note to my friends let's
turn this shit up to 11 and dive into
the benchmarks
all righty so as we'd expect the 1084
the wind beats out the founders edition
in pretty much every test at every
resolution most of the time it's a
marginal victory by three or four FPS on
average but I'd imagine we'd cop an
extra frame or two when overclocking
with that additional 60 megahertz I was
able to dial in earlier obviously the
card crushes at full HD in 1440 and even
4k gaming isn't out of the question as
long as you're ok with disabling
anti-aliasing and some additional eye
candy in a nutshell what EVGA brings to
the table here with therefore the win
Edition is an enhanced version of what's
already the fastest single GPU card on
the market that stays well below
referenced temps and acoustics if I'm
being nitpicky I would like to see more
led effects added in the future as the
lighting on this card is just really
badass and it would be a shame not to
take full advantage of that also I did
encounter some frustration with the
packaging plastic wrap being stuck
underneath the screws congratulations
EVGA you've somehow managed to take away
the joy of peeling off plastic wrap
overall though this is a feature packed
card that checks all the boxes for what
a good aftermarket card should be and
I'm confident any enthusiast gamer will
enjoy all it has to offer
but let me know what you guys think
