brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
Corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below alright
at the ASU spoof look at that engine
ease for excellence yada yada yada just
show me the x5 70 boards damn it oh and
x5 70 boards they have they actually
already have six different ROG options
on x5 70 platform which is kind of
unprecedented for AMD support in the
past we've seen this many options for
Intel but to actually have this 14
read/write from launch is pretty telling
of their confidence in the new platform
horizon 3000 for starters we have three
ROG from the crosshair boards and we
have three ro 2 Strix boards the Strix
boards are a little bit more affordable
I would say than the crosshairs but they
still don't slouch on many of the gaming
features that gamers use however there
are some premium gaming features that
Asus realizes the mainstream consumer
might not be interested in and so
they've actually stripped those down for
the Strix models to keep the prices a
bit more reasonable so we actually have
the ROG Strix next 578 gaming right
there looking very very nice and blingy
the Strix x5 70f gaming and not gee it
would have been fitting if they had a G
but this is the x5 7 TI gaming the Mini
ITX version which is actually pretty
pretty pretty cool i really like this
large heatsink that looks like it's for
an m2 slot i believe there's also
additional cooling under that don't
quote me on this but it looks like
there's additional cooling under there
for the x5 70 chipset itself because as
we know it does get fairly warm it's
actually got a much higher TDP than X
470 I think it's something like 10 to 13
watts as opposed to 5 watts on the last
gen so that's quite a big difference you
can see why there's so many active
cooling solutions on these new boards we
also have a pretty nice sort of i/o
cover here which looks to be metallic
correlates parts of it are metallic
which is also going to aid in heat
dissipation and then we have the big boy
the big boys the ROG crosshair 8 hero
Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 6 you can see the antennas
they're a very nice sleek aesthetic
active
here on the on the chipset we also get
an rog supreme FX 1228 channel codec
high-definition deck so if you have a
nice pair of cans this is going to pair
nicely with that the sport is incredibly
well engineered from the looks of it and
from what Asus is telling us however it
goes up a step further to the ROG
crosshair eight formula this is their
flagship board you see it's actually got
water cooling integration water block
from the BR ends courtesy of ek just
like on the crosshair seven formula that
I used for hot line two we have active
cooling once again looks like there's an
LCD screen right there on the IO shield
or the IO cover I should say I'm sure
that's configurable as well it's for the
same onboard audio sound card as the
crosshair 8 hero and down here we have
the ROG crosshair 8 impact Mini ITX
actually no mini DTX you can see here
this is actually a little bit longer
than your standard ATX board which I
have not seen in quite some time
so we actually have this little guy
right here it's actually serving as a
heat sink for 2 m2 slot so you can do
PTC ihn 4 of course the whole x5 70
platform is is built around PCIe Gen 4
so that's actually pretty cool it's
actually slotting in a horizontally for
a reason that's actually to allow for
more airflow to permeate through the
actual array and heatsink and stuff so
it actually stays a bit cooler actually
thought that through of course there is
still a full sized 5/16 PCIe gen four
slot just beneath it so you can add a
discrete GPU otherwise what's the point
look at that pretty fancy supreme FX a
sound card right there that looks that
looks pretty cool I know that there's
something special about that but we
haven't been able to find an AC enough
to help us so I'm not sure what else to
say about it look at it over the eye
okay when you hear there's some mesh
design but more importantly there's
actually what looks to be two fans
underneath there for active erm cooling
right on top of the heatsink because of
course it's gonna get relatively warm
under love so asus wants to make sure
that it stays for a fairly cool for
extreme overclocking on this mini dt x
board this is a mini ITX concept case
from asus completely concept so it's not
very sure if we're gonna bring it to
market or not doesn't even have a name
yet just concept case but it's a mini
ITX of course they're actually fitting
the mini dt x board the
the ROG won the ROG crosshair that we
just showed off earlier X 570 you can
see we've got 240 millimeter radiator
right here on the side there's actually
supports five fans which is pretty
impressive for the sides you got one
intake at the bottom there two of course
on our radiator and there's two more up
top which is exhausting hot air
currently we also have a very
interesting motherboard layout it's it's
impossible to see really with all this
glare but the board is actually mounted
11 degrees slanted the 11 degree tilt
that's basically for it for a couple
reasons for starters it actually allows
us a little bit more breathing room for
our GPU you can see we've got a nice
Strix card here and by the way full-size
Hardware pretty much across the board
even ATX power supply at the bottom but
it gives you a little bit more breathing
room particularly on the left side of
the GPU because it's at a slant it's
further away from the front panel and if
you notice here there's actually a bunch
of ventilation I'm sorry ventilation
right here which is of course going to
be helping air flow for your GPU so
you've got a fast running powerful card
is it's not going to be suffocated too
much the tilt also gives us more room
behind the motherboard tray for cable
managing and I believe you might be able
to mount a driver to back there of
course they do have an RGB SSD that's
mounted right over here over top of the
the drive cage which also has a
reservoir pump mount if you wanted to do
some custom water cooling in here you
very well could you can see here we've
got some RGB lighting it also have you
look up there above the motherboard you
can see the rear i/o cables are actually
routed down to the backside of the case
so they actually come out relatively
gracefully one with the power supply the
concept of this case is to really use a
small form factor but not compromise on
performance full-size Hardware thermals
and even acoustics so you kind of get
everything in here pretty much anything
that enthusiasts might desire in a
relatively small footprint what do you
guys think in this case let me know so
what we have here is the asus rog swift
PG 2 7 you q-x
as the name suggests this is a 27-inch
monitor 4k 144 Hertz but that's not even
the most special thing about it those
are a dime a dozen these days what
really sets this motor apart is it's
actually the world's first mini LED Peck
based monitor mini LED actually offers a
lot of the same benefits that OLED does
for example having really rich true deep
blacks which also gives you better
contrast higher dynamic range however
because of their smaller size they
actually don't create any burnin there's
zero risk of burnin you can leave it
just pretty much idle like this without
moving it for four years
okay that's maybe a little dramatic but
for days on end and you would not burn
in whatsoever so they've kind of got the
best of both worlds here between an OLED
panel for example in a more traditional
LED the actual picture quality I know
it's impossible to tell from the camera
but it looks like an OLED display the
blacks are extremely extremely deep and
rich very accurate because the LEDs are
actually turning off for those darker
spots there's actually between 5 to 600
LED zones that can locally dim which is
fantastic and we also have quite a bit
of other specs that are noteworthy
including DCI p3 so if quantum
technology with DCI p3 and Adobe RGB
support there's also a way I pretty much
covered it well I'm good I'm really good
at this no definite word on pricing or
availability but expect this monitor to
be relatively close to the $2,000 mark I
have my sources
okay yes day 1 is officially a wrap
we're all pretty much tapped out
but we'll be back tomorrow thanks for
