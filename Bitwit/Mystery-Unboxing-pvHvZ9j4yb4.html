awesomesauce news here to give you all
another unboxing and overview of this
special mystery package that I just got
in the mail today so I know it's
probably killing you guys this is Spence
so let me just take it out of the box
and show you all what I have in store
for you today drum roll please I present
to you a cat that's right today I'll be
doing an unboxing and quick overview of
this cat made by another cat and there
are many variations of this model but
this is the black-and-white edition
although I'm not sure if they sent me
the male model or the theme UPS the male
model
just a few specs I want to list off this
cat weighs in five-and-a-half pounds has
an adjustable height of eight to ten
inches and a length just under 12 inches
keep in mind guys that these dimensions
are subject to change and you are going
to see a depreciation of cuteness over
time I also want to point out that this
is the short-haired domestic version
which does help minimize shedding but
still carries the chance of triggering a
violent allergic reaction taking a look
at the head of the cat we can see some
typical run-of-the-mill features
everything from the ears nose mouth and
even the hazel eyes makes you wonder how
such an adorable creature could make
your life a living hell
now while the included teeth are
relatively sharp the real thing you need
to watch out for here guys are the claws
and it's usually best to keep them away
from wood leather and human skin at all
times especially since any damage caused
by them is not covered by warranty which
by the way is voided when you buy the
cat stomach back and sides are all fully
covered by authentic short-haired fur
and of course we've got four mounted
legs as seen with most standard cats the
tail on this model is slightly elongated
which theoretically grants better
balance but also a higher probability of
hitting you in the face when you're
trying to sleep quick disclaimer guys so
as you start getting used to owning your
first cat you'll start to realize that
your cat actually owns you so incessant
meowing for example is a common tactic
of holding your sanity hostage until you
tend to the cat's needs also be sure to
ask the cat for permission first before
using its new bed chair or keyboard most
importantly change out the litter box
frequently as the fuller gets the more
you'll find yourself at the cat's mercy
when it looks you dead in the eye and
on your rug and lastly s in general
upkeep and maintenance advice don't
bother buying toys or trinkets for your
cat instead you can just use the box
that they came in they'll love it and
when it's time to thank you
they want all right guys that's going to
wrap it up for this video once again
there's been the short-haired domestic
cats in black and white I'm Kyle with
awesomesauce news if you guys enjoy this
video be sure to like and subscribe to

watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
