channel today is a very exciting day oh
yes it is because today's the day that I
get to unbox this bad boy right here
this is the gtx 1080i from nvidia and
covering up all the boxing stuff and the
Embargo just lifted for the unboxing
unfortunately there's a second embargo
that's at a later date for the
performance so too bad we won't be able
to actually take this thing for a spin
and check out performance but that is
soon to follow I don't even know I mean
I know you guys are dying for that
information because I am too I like like
you see here I have not even taken this
out of the box it's still sealed or not
and everything so I have no idea if the
claims are true but the reason why this
is so exciting is because Nvidia Oh
funny bone ah why did they call it a
funny bone it's not even funny
they should call it an uncomfortable
bone now what I was gonna say before my
nerves so rudely interrupted me was that
this is a big deal and the reason why is
because it's a super fast video card
it's supposed to be 35% faster than a
GTX 1080 out of the box which means you
haven't even overclocked the damn thing
yet maybe you don't care about
overclocking still 35% faster than what
you could achieve on a GTX 1080 as well
as faster than a Titan X now these are
all claims made by the manufacturer of
course I have to pop it in the test the
old one of these test beds actually
that's a 370 X so I have to pop it in
this test bed in a week or so or in a
few days actually and validate those
claims to see if they're actually true
but the promise on the table is very
compelling especially if you've got $700
to burn and you're looking for a
high-end gaming experience quite frankly
it doesn't get much better than it so
why don't I just shut the hell up and
start unboxing the same thing I'm going
to read up some basic specs however if
you are interested in a finer detail of
specification you can check out the
video that I already did at Nvidia
editor day while GDC was going on oh
let's just take a moment oh it's got
that got that fresh foam smell ah I'm
just gonna bottle up the scent and sell
it on eBay
Oh
it looks to be some documentation
including a QuickStart guide it's
quicker than a QuickStart guide not
reading it and we've also got what looks
to be DisplayPort DisplayPort to DVI or
vice-versa adapter AHA so if your
monitor does not have the appropriate
connector then perhaps you can use this
adapter to help you out then let's just
talk about the card now because it's
really really why we're all here look at
how much it looks like a gtx 10a
it looks exactly the same oh wow i
butchered that that is that is the worst
officially the worst unwrapping of a
video card I have ever done in my life
but here it is let's go ahead and
there's a little bit of plastic here rip
of the plastic wrap here we go oh I was
all right I've definitely had better but
you can see we've still got the very
familiar vapor chamber design however it
has been improved under the hood a bit
to deliver a bit more cooling surface to
the GPU which should deliver us about a
reduction in 5 degrees Celsius compared
to the GT x 1080 cooler which is nice to
see or you can maintain the same low
temperature and just have a quieter
acoustic profile by not having to ramp
up the fan as much out of the box core
clock frequency is 1 point 6 gigahertz
and if you guys remember the live demo
that Nvidia gave during their streams
they actually took the cards to over 2
gigahertz I believe just from GPU boost
just having the proper power and thermal
conditions in place was able to take the
card over 2 gigahertz which means
they're saying over a 400 megahertz GPU
boost that is freaking crazy I mean I
don't know how much room is left for
overclocking really but if it's as much
overclocking sealing as something like
the GTX 1080 then we can potentially be
seeing 2.1 gigahertz easy and and and
even beyond that now externally you're
not going to find many differences
between this and the GTX 1080
of course we do have a beefed-up power
delivery with one six pin in one eight
pin PCI connector pretty much the same
as the Titan X Pascal and this card is
gonna be operating at a 250 watt TDP so
we're going to be consuming more power
and perhaps creating more heat with this
guy than the GTX 280 but at 35 percent
of a performance increase out of the box
I would probably
that'd be the case we've also got a very
nice back plate on the back again very
similar to what we have on the 1080
although says of course GTX 1080p is
dead externally the only other main
change that you'll find on this card is
the rear i/o you can see that Nvidia is
actually omitted the dual link DVI
connector in favor of additional
ventilation for the rear exhaust so that
way more air can actually just be blown
out the back of the card and I'm pretty
sure that's one of the strategies that's
been put into place to help reduce this
card to five degrees Celsius over the
GTX 1080 and I'm totally in favor of
that I think that's a good call
especially since you already do have
four video outputs including three
DisplayPort 1.4 and an HDMI 2.0 be apart
from that it's all the same familiar
stuff folks you get to SLI fingers right
here up to two ASL I know three or four
we support unfortunately with us to be
expected from Nvidia at this point and
then you can see here we've also got our
PCIe gen3 by 16 connector look at them
gold connectives look at that go yeah
classic GeForce GTX branding that does
light up green when powered on still
waiting for an RGB version that isn't a
DIY solution that would be pretty sweet
and then what else do you offer me
people this is pretty much it you get a
blower style fan there are there screws
holding the card together and yeah
that's pretty much all I can really say
about the gtx 10a api for now again if
you wanted a bit more detail with the
specifications you can go ahead and
watch the video that i posted at editors
day where i go over the details on that
but that's pretty nuts gonna do it for
now guys i just want to get this video
out there to show you that this is
coming be review my review and my gaming
benchmarks of this card are coming very
soon so stay tuned to be sure to
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already seen don't miss it
and also toss me a like on this video if
you enjoyed it because that helps me as
well and I leave your feedback in the
comments below on your thoughts on this
new card
and video as always you guys I am calleb
it would thank you so much for watching
have a good day and I will see y'all in
the next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
