channel today I am building yet another
computer shocker I know this time it's
for my beautiful wife Heather who's in
the other room right now her system
currently is well I had to gut her
system actually about a month or two ago
because I had to use some of the parts
for my dad's PC at the time and she
wasn't really using her desktop all that
much so I felt it would be appropriate
to kind of rob her of the computer I had
initially given her two Christmases ago
but shortly after that she started
indicating that she was missing her old
desktop and so now it's time that I
finally built her a proper new one so
that's what we're doing today I've
actually compiled a list of new and used
parts including everything that's on
this table and I'm just going to start
off with the case here this is brand new
I just bought this I picked it up off of
new egg was kind of an impulse buy but I
thought it would kind of match the
dimensions of the BitFenix prodigy it's
actually shorter and slimmer than the
prodigy but it's a I think it's like an
inch or two longer but more or less it's
about the same dimensions I just think
it looks a little bit sleek the other
thing about the BitFenix prodigy it's
got those rubber handles on the top and
bottom those tend to get dirty pretty
quickly over time and they get more more
and more difficult to clean because of
the rubbery material it can just you
know go over with a like a wet wipe or a
paper towel or anything you got to get
like one of those magic erasers it's
just kind of a hassle also I thought I'd
bling it up a little bit with a side
panel window which the prodigy did not
have so we get to be a little bit more
fancy this time around so it should be
nice power supply is also brand new it's
a sea Sonic m12 - I've actually never
used this before but I found our new egg
it is fully modular 520 watt power
supply you guys should definitely check
this out if you're on a budget and
you're looking for a fully modular unit
because this was only 60 or 70 bucks
which I thought was a killer deal
especially see Sonic is a great brand
for power supplies so I'll be using that
as well
we've got bit phoenix alchemy LED strip
just a simple this is the alchemy 1.0 i
might be using a 2.0 that i've got
tucked away in the closet somewhere if i
can find a good place to put it inside
of the case we've also got more BitFenix
cables here the white extension sleeves
these are the original sleeves that i've
used for my very first pc i bill
in the 600 tee and don't don't confuse
this build with the all-white belt that
I was teasing earlier in previous videos
guys are on social media because this is
not it this is just a wife a wife build
if you will on the white the all-white
themed PC is coming soon I guarantee it
probably pop up sometime in November and
I'll be using these again for that build
as well but I thought it would go really
nice of course with the white enclosure
here and then moving on to CPU and
motherboard this is actually used this
is another used parts two very main used
parts including the the H 105 that's
already on here the reason why it's
already installed is because I just took
this out of a different system it was in
the half 912 one of the the half
stackers that I use currently I have
stripped it out as you can see for this
2600 K and the PhD 77 I deluxe
motherboards so we are rocking an older
generation of chipsets as well as a
generation of Intel CPU but 2600 K is
still a great CPU we shouldn't have too
many issues with that especially for the
you know limited workload that Heather's
going to be using for on a day to day
basis should be just fine it's still a
great CPU we've also got 8 gigs of ram
this is Corsair Vengeance matches in
blue of course very nice 1600 speed that
should do the job just fine
and for graphics we have this GTX 970
now you shouldn't worry about any kind
of bottlenecking the the with the CPU
because oh by the way its EVGA this is
their for the win Edition there you go
so it comes factory overclocked please
you can worry about any kind of
bottlenecking issues the 2600 K again
even if it's stock and not overclocked
shouldn't be an issue other than that
we've got these two venturi HP fans
these are 120 s these are just going to
be slapping onto the H 105 because the
Corsair fans that it comes with can get
a little bit louder than than I'd like
and these venturi fans have been really
happy with how they've been performing
in hot line back there so I had two
extras that I would slap him in also I
think the the sleek black look would
kind of match the overall aesthetic a
bit more proper and then we've got this
other fractal fan it's a vinter no it's
not a venturi this is one of the case
fans that I got off of the define r5 I
believe it's just a 140 and
140 mount at the back of the end to
evolve ITX I don't even know if I even
mention the name of this case at the end
to evolve ITX right there and I think
that's pretty much those are all the
parts for this build hopefully go
smoothly and why don't we just go ahead
and jump into it and start building this
thing
it's just a quick update did kind of
want to log or document some of my
experiences that I've been having so far
when building in the the evolve I TX so
first off this case does feature a
pullout bracket for a 240 or 280
millimeter radiator on top so you can do
a quick and easy installation kind of
outside of the case first
you know mount the radiator and fans to
the bracket and then slide it in but
what they don't tell you is that you
can't have the motherboard installed
first otherwise the tubing isn't really
long enough to get the radiator and the
brackets slid into place into the the
grooves of the metal frame up here so
and then and then alternately you can't
really have the motherboard uninstalled
and then install the radiator first
because then you can't reach the top two
screws very easily to mount down the
motherboard in fact this one you can't
reach at all you can you can get by with
this the screw over here so what I ended
up having to do was remove the top panel
entirely and leave the radiator bracket
installed and just mount the radiator to
the top like you would in any other
normal case that supports 240 rads up
top so that was kind of inconvenient the
other thing is that and I already
already knew this going into the bill
that I forgot to mention it is that the
motherboard only has two fan headers one
for the CPU and only one other system
fan header there there on the top left
corner you can kind of see them so what
I'm going to do is a little bit of
splitter action I've got some some wise
players they are PWM thanks to the
venturi fractal fans which which each
fan comes with a fan splitter and I have
like like twelve of these fans for
hotline and other things so I'm
basically just doing a kind of like I
don't know adapter frenzy here gonna be
plugging this into one of those system
fan headers and I've got two more
splitters coming off of each of those
one one fan header should be enough to
drive all four of these fans it
shouldn't be an issue so I've got four
case fans or let's say I've got two of
these I've got one 200 millimeter that
the case comes with at the front and
then slowing this one for you see I've
got four case fans in here for the most
parts and then I'm going to need one for
the the pump for the H 105 so that
should be good
I'm gonna be set for that the other
thing that I forgot to mention is
storage you probably like what happened
to the storage why do you mention
storage well it's because I actually
don't have a good reason for that other
than I completely forgot to put it on
the table so I forgot to talk about it
what am I going to be using this is kind
of just I haven't even given it this any
forethought I'll probably use this
vertex for it's 128 gig SSD from OCZ
it's an older SSD but it should be fine
for Heather and then I've got see how
this hard drive from Toshiba this is a
1.5 terabyte I believe now it's 2
terabyte so she gets 2 terabytes of
storage mechanically and I'm just gonna
leave this out right here so don't
forget it a second time so she gets 1
SSD in one mechanical and she should be
happy with that she's not then she can
suck it I know I'm just kidding honey I
love you but yeah so let's pretty much
all I wanted to say give you a little
update now let's go back to the build go
all right bill complete ladies and
gentlemen here it is feast your eyes on
this beauty as you can see I did try to
color coordinated as best I could you
know as you slide with the white cables
and kind of the blue the blue on the
video card the blue Ram the the CPU
cooler and motherboard and things like
that um I wasn't able to get the LED in
there just because there wasn't any good
place to put it even though the shorter
12-centimeter when I had just wasn't
able to fit anywhere reasonably you
can't really put it on the side panel
because the windows so damn huge and
even if I were to kind of put the LED
strip maybe on the edge here even the
really outer edge you could still see
the LEDs quite easily through that
big-ass window so I think it still looks
good without it you know that just would
have been a nice cherry on top but what
can you do apart from that everything
else went well building in the system
was absolutely fantastic for a mini ITX
I granted it is fairly large for a mini
ITX compared to like an SG zero five or
something like that but obviously you
can do a lot more here you know custom
water cooling and things like that but
one thing I did not like about this case
other than the radiator bracket not
being able to to go in with these the
you know the tube length on this h 105
which I expressed earlier but this top
panel here which I had to remove to
again install the radiator it has like
sixteen screws that you have to remove
before you can take off that damn front
panel or that top panel which is really
annoying I actually had to pop it off
one more time unexpectedly because I had
to route the USB 3.0 cable right above
there because it wasn't long enough to
go the other way and I just had to like
undo like 16 screws again and it was
just a huge pain in the ass so I'm not
sure what's up with that but apart from
that this is a really nice little mini
ITX case and hopefully my wife get some
good performance out of this thing
hopefully it serves her well I know she
isn't gonna be gaming on it too much but
if she does when she does she'll be well
equipped I would imagine
with the hardware that I've given her
today so is there anything else I wanted
to say about this system build before we
close out no I don't think so
that's gonna do for now guys be sure to
toss me a like on this video if you
enjoyed it feel free to subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already I've got
a lot of more a lot more good content
coming very soon
