was pretty useless because of the wind
noise rip but today I'm gonna see what
it's like to buy all your PC parts in
store at a local Best Buy they do carry
a wider selection of components on their
website but I'm more curious about the
brick-and-mortar experience for someone
trying to build a PC at one of these
stores so once we're inside I'll mainly
be looking at selection and prices to
figure out what kind of rig we can put
together here we go okay first thing
we're scoping out here is CPUs and this
is as far as I can tell the only CPU
options that they have here in the store
you can see we have two rise in options
rising 5 2600 right here for 199 and
horizon 7 2700 x4 329 we just looked up
prices comparing the two and these are
actually both fairly overpriced compared
to what you could find them on Newegg
and Amazon for you can find the 2600 for
about 150 right now on either of those
sites and we were looking at around 279
289 for the 2700 X so president doesn't
seem to be a great option here for
buying in store the story's a little bit
different here on the Intel side so if
we've got a 9400 Core i5 for 215 this is
sort of the exception here we actually
found it cheaper by about 15 20 dollars
on Amazon and Newegg however these two
products are on sale we've got an 8700
core i7 this is locked however it's not
the case scale that was going for 279
and that was the same price that we
could find it for on both of those sites
so very competitive there and finally
even topping that deal we have the i-5
9600 K which is $219.99 that's ten
dollars ten to fifteen dollars cheaper
than we could find it on either Amazon
or Newegg at the time of filming this is
also on sale as well so bear that in
mind it was previously 279 which would
be a terrible value in comparison but at
219 this is actually cheaper than buying
it online plus you not to deal with any
shipping cost etc so at this point guys
I'm just gonna follow the prices and
whatever prices make the most sense to
buy in store those are the parts I'm
gonna reach for so consider Intel our
platform of choice for today's bill so
if you thought their in-store CPU
options were limited then their
motherboard options seem pretty slim too
they actually only have four different
motherboard models here it seems ones be
450 so that's AMD we've got a crosshair
seven so that's X 470 we can't use
either of those options we do have an
ROG Strix and C 390 II gaming which
would support our 96
okay that comes in at 249 99 which is
about 15 to 20 dollars more expensive at
the time of filming we also have an MSI
mpg:0mpg speed:0mph revs:849rpm
and it's still 30 dollars cheaper a new
egg holy moly whoo okay I'm really
curious about 1660 Ti so this is just an
EVGA oh it says it right here I could
just read the stupid label XC ultra I
want you to guess how much it is on
Amazon Smith 29 to 29 oh is that the
same one though
I'm still on the RX 5 5 8
for the prices I'm stolen what but they
could price-match says shipped from and
sold by amazon.com wait seriously
yeah we might be able to get a price
match on this okay I'm putting this in
the card we'll see what happens
memory options are a bit underwhelming
as one might expect but they do have
some reliable kits from Corsair here
we've got the Vengeance pro series and
then a more cost-effective vengeance lpx
at twenty four hundred and three
thousand we looked at pricing it's
actually five dollars cheaper here than
it is on Amazon for this particular kit
that's going for $69.99 I think it was
$2.00 cheaper on Newegg actually and
then over here the same same sort of
deal five dollars cheaper here than on
Amazon and two or three dollars cheaper
on new eggs so we're just gonna go with
a simple 16 gigabyte 3000 megahertz kit
especially because at the same price as
the 2400 kit there alright so for the
SSDs we were actually looking at the the
970 Evo pluses because they're - they're
fast they're very reliable the 500 gig
is 119 which is the exact same price
amazon has for it no eggs like two
dollars cheaper so we're actually gonna
go with that one I'm not gonna get a
mechanical drive here we're just gonna
go with the 500 gig m2 just for
reference though we did look up the
prices for this guy the one terabyte 3d
from SanDisk and it's about ten dollars
cheaper on Amazon I think new egg was
about the same by far the worst deal
that we saw here was the the SN 750 from
from WD it's actually about 20-30
dollars cheaper on the e-tailer sites
but again if you can price match not a
bad deal moving our way to power
supplies here we've got a couple options
from EVGA a lot of them are a bit more
than what we need them for but we also
have some respectable options in the 650
to 750 range we just looked at pricing
for the CX 650 M which they have it here
for again on sale $79.99 for a 650 semi
modular unit 80 plus bronze on Newegg
it's for five dollars more Amazon it's
same price just look up the pricing for
the 700 BR which they have here for
59.99 it is actually more expensive on
both Newegg and Amazon by about $5 so
eight dollars on eight eight eight
dollars more expensive on Amazon 9 so it
seems like power supplies here are
actually really competitive compared to
some of the other components that we've
seen not that they've all been bad
personally I think this is a solid
option so we're gonna go with this
alright taking a look at the coolers
here we've got a Corsair h-60 this is
actually the older version not not the
one with like LED lighting and stuff you
can tell by the waterblock
it's on sale for sick
d dollars and that is actually much
cheaper than the $73 that Amazon had a
priced at and the one hundred and ten
dollars that it's on new egg for right
now logistically though this might not
be enough to cut it for our 9600 K
especially we're gonna overclocked and
nothing can potentially hit 5 gigahertz
and it does get pretty pretty warm under
loads so we looked at the pricing for
the H 100 I Pro RGB as well 240
millimeter radiator going for 130 999
very competitive all the pricing across
three platforms is about one to three
dollar difference so not much change
there we're gonna go with this one oh
that's a big box thank you any that's
not big boy okay so we just met a fan
actually really cool kid over there hey
kid what's your name again
Jason do you mind being in the video
yeah hey Jason
thanks thanks for saying hi earlier what
card are you thinking about buyer now
okay what's your budget right now 185
185 okay that's what do they have it for
right now
okay so maybe you can price match that
what would be the card that you would
get if you actually had like more budget
obviously you're limited by your CPU
1662 yeah I think it's the XE ultra that
they had here right okay cool
how much is that one 303 nineteen you
can price you could price mice that
match that - it's probably way cheaper
if you want dude
here's let me tell you what's what's
gonna happen right now we're gonna we're
gonna buy you the 16 60 TI because
that's the card you want and you just
you were such a cool guy like coming up
to us and being an awesome fan and you
seem you seem so passionate about PC
building and stuff so we're just gonna
buy that card for you I know it's gonna
be put to good use so yeah no no worries
man
it's it's our pleasure thanks Russ on
the channel you heard the man so the
kind stuff at Best Buy is helping us
check out now they're very nice the one
thing that you might notice we don't
have in the cart or in the store at all
is computer cases there's actually no
computer cases that are in stock at
brick-and-mortar locations at Best Buy
they do sell chassis Zahn they're online
but unfortunately we don't have a case
so if anyone who is who can actually
make big decisions at Best Buy is
watching this consider selling computer
cases so that people who go to your
store and want to build a computer from
start to finish can actually do so
without having to go online they could
just kind of window shop and get
everything they need in one spot just my
two sets for what it's worth
we're gonna go check out head back home
and put this thing together all right
we're back home and here the parts laid
on the table except for the case of
course we'll address that in a moment
but I didn't give you guys the grand
total earlier it is came out two out the
door eleven hundred and sixty three
dollars and five cents now remember we
did we did the price match so I was very
happy with how they honor the price
matching for the 1660 CI that definitely
saved us more than a few bucks so apart
from that though we didn't really need
to price match anything else that the
rates were already pretty competitive
there was probably one or two other
parts on this list that we could have
priced matched to say like a dollar or
two but it wasn't really worth it so
that being said just just take a look
over here I actually added up all the
parts I added up what all those parts
part for part making sure to get the
exact SKUs and models correct on both
Amazon and Newegg to see what they would
come out to compared to the Best Buy
total and for Amazon we came out to
eleven hundred and sixty four dollars
and fifty seven cents which is roughly a
dollar fifty more expensive than what we
spent at that brick-and-mortar store
just now Neely's even worse twelve
hundred and twelve dollars and
eighty-seven cents now of course this is
all subject to change all these rates
could be different tomorrow you know and
the ranking of these three retailers
could change overnight honestly because
of just how often prices fluctuate
whether you're talking about an e tailor
or a brick-and-mortar store but that
doesn't change the fact that Best Buy
was our winner today and that's pretty
cool another thing worth noting is at
the Amazon and Newegg prices I just
showed you do not include shipping and
that's mainly because for Amazon I'm a
prime member so I don't pay for shipping
anyway although that is technically
paying for shipping because I pay for
Prime membership anyway you get the
point there and then for Newegg I think
they just have free shipping for my area
I'm not exactly sure why but bear that
in mind is that if you are buying from
an e tailor you might not have free
shipping that might be an additional
cost that you have to factor into your
overall budget whereas with a physical
store you're pretty much just paying for
the gas mileage to and from the store
which is typically going to be less than
whatever shipping
they're involved and I feel like overall
this video might put to rest a lot of
the rumors that Best Buy Hardware is
super expensive overpriced and should be
avoided at all costs and I think that's
true in some cases for example our 16 60
TI was was pretty overpriced in store
but the fact that Best Buy honors price
matching kind of makes that argument a
moot point and certainly makes buying
hardware from Best Buy a bit more
appealing the Achilles heel of buying
computer parts at Best Buy isn't the
pricing really it's the selection that's
really where they fall short is in
variety actually if you think about it a
lack of variety does kind of translate
to potentially higher cost because if
you're only given options a B and C
there could be cheaper options that
still suit your needs
say D through Z that you just don't have
access to so you're kind of forced at
that point into buying pricier hardware
to get the same job done potentially so
you could make that argument as well
really at the end of the day it's a lack
of variety that's hurting Best Buy's PC
DIY market if they're really trying to
grow that part of their business getting
more parts in the store is the first
step in the right direction
specifically cases get get at least a
few cases in there so people can
actually build a full PC and then start
filling in the rest
speaking of cases we need one of those
don't we so because I don't want to wait
around for Best Buy shipping or any one
shipping and because I already have
plenty of cases I'm just gonna choose
one of these how do we got here we do
have the Corsair specs here but we use
one of those recently for the cable
management contest that's out of the
question that's micro ATX that's too old
that's too small and old this box is
empty and what is this Oh what what what
case is this
maybe this oh haha p600 ass eclipse
oh yeah piece of country s yeah let's
choose you I choose you
wait and I think I got a friggin
uninstall all this crap oh it looks so
nice Oh although I already stripped
already stripped to CPU and they'll CPU
in there so things dead to me but you
know what I think I'm gonna skip the
time lapse building portion I'm just
gonna directly show you guys the
finished product of all the components
installed inside the case because I've
pretty much said everything I wanted to
say about my experience of buying parts
at Best Buy if you guys have anything to
contribute your ed or comment on feel
free to do so down below feel free to
toss a like on this video if you enjoyed
it and get subscribe
we're tech stuff coming at you really
soon thanks for watching guys I will see
you in the next video
now here's here's the finish build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
