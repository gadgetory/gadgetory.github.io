booted this is episode three of season
four I don't know why I'm talking like a
sports announcer what's up guys
that's better this sounds more this
sounds more me it sounds more natural
just drinking some wine here how's it
going hope you're all doing fantastic
thank you all for joining me all of you
early comers woo in chat and we'll let
the other late late comers
roll in here give them a second or two
welcome this is uh this is the third
episode three out of four we have five
more contestants to go which are all
very good I'm very I'm very impressed
with all the systems that were showing
off today I've got some really strong
runners and this is this is the final
five basically so after this we choose
one more finalist at the end of this
episode and next week is the final round
where we take a look at the basically
all three finalists who will compete for
the $500 grand prize and speaking of
which let's take a look at last week's
finalists which was very impressive
this was Daphne now I don't know I mean
there's really nothing from stopping
anyone who submits a PC to booted from
using a false name so this could very
well just be a dude who is like I'm
gonna make my name Daphne and pretend
I'm a girl but if this is a girl that's
even more awesome because that would
mean it's to my knowledge the first
female who's entered booted and in even
so even beyond that the first female in
the series to actually be a finalist so
this is really exciting stuff because
you know I mean to just honestly you
don't see as many female system builders
so it's really awesome when you see one
that that kicks ass
like I like Daphne here so here's her
system just there quick recap very
beautiful black and white color scheme
4790k
and two of them gtx 980 s wind force
edition awesome stuff and it's I didn't
really realize this until after last
week
but the other finalists that we have
here who is Michael this is Michael
system and Michael systems similar to
Daphne's in certain ways in in the fact
that it's also a black and white themed
completely different case and different
parts all around but kind of a you know
there's some parallels there so it's
kind of interesting that these two lined
up it's gonna be close though cuz both
are really clean systems and like I said
we've got more good competition coming
at you today so before we get right into
it why don't we go ahead and take a look
at our loving sponsor who is fantex and
the infant or it's not fantasy Wow Wow
Kyle this I swear this is my first glass
of wine it even says overclocked by
cable mud right there right there in the
corner it says it I'm just on autopilot

so just gives you a bit more options
there when customizing and tricking out
your rig Thank You Camelot
you are awesome and holy moly thank you
real lunacy for the generous donation
this is so you can afford beer next time
you know what yeah we wine can get
pretty pricey granted I'm I'm I'm a
cheap bastard so this is probably like a
ten dollar bottle of wine but thank you
very much for that donation I will be
spending it very wisely on copious
amounts of alcohol appreciate that again
donations on booted are never required
but always recommended in the words of
Frankel Josh I didn't say recommended I
met I meant to say appreciated
they're never required always
appreciated Josh never said the first
thing I said is this this is awesome
okay I think we can go ahead and start
off with our first contender Luke I am
NOT your father
but you have a sick ass rig look at this
an NZXT h2 you wouldn't even know it's
an h2 because it's so modded a lot of
mods went into this you can just tell
right off the bat beautiful case mods
here with the core i7 3770k so not the
newest CPU but still a very worthy ready
chip does some damage in games I'm sure
I know my 2600 cave still you know
paying the bills in NY fees and YP
sauces PC we've also got two gtx 980 s
in sli which also looks like you've
swapped out the green branding for white
because this is a white black and blue
themed pc look how beautiful that is
everyone he's got some carbon fiber tape
or carbon-fiber accents lining the
lining many parts of the system actually
not just the outside rim give it a nice
rim job but also on the inside of the
chassis as well a lot of custom work
done here very nice luke i'm really
loving the vector SSDs here in the
corner the top right corner that just i
don't know very well placed and just
just everything's so clean here if i
if I had a gripe it would be that I
would like to see more white in your
cables just like you have the 24-pin ATX
there I would have liked to see the same
kind of pattern in any other cables
there like with your PCIe cables and
even maybe that sound card there that
that Asus peeve is so low
that's just soloing over there but then
this is a nice nice build here you've
also done some work to put a 280
millimeter radiator in there it looks
like with that Corsair h 110 i GT I
think the case only the h2 only natively
supports a 240 millimeter radiator so
you must have done some custom work
there to get that rad installed very
nice very nice stuff man I'm diggin it
16 gigs of Patriot Viper and it looks
like you've done a little bit of paint
paint job on at least two of those dims
as well from what I can tell sexy and I
love the other Stark Industries sticker
that you have there on the front just
adds a lot of personality and you can
definitely see you've done some work
there even underneath that front panel
with that that kind of like fan fan
grille type thing they're not really
grilles it's not a grille but you know
the fan mounting bracket looks very very
sexy I think that I believe that's also
carbon fiber matching very nicely with
the theme and I think natively this case
has a couple 5min of quarter inch Bay's
up there so you had to have remove those
and taking a look at the side again here
it also has the h2 also has a pretty
beefy hard drive cage which looked
obviously has been removed and it looks
like you've just got two hard drives
stacked on top of each other at the
bottom your case which I mean if it
works it works as long as there's no
annoying you know vibration noise and
you know they're keeping cool enough
which I'm sure they are then fantastic I
like how they're just tucked away down
their hard drive should not be should
not be one of the more visible
components in your system in my opinion
and look at that look at that window you
see that window look good that this
is
also custom a full I don't know if it's
acrylic or tempered glass but either way
it looks beautiful just the whole door
looks like it's on hinges you can tell
from this picture here that it's
definitely no weight
from the side picture it's on hinges
there and it's just a full top to bottom
side to side window absolutely stunning
very nice job Luke I wish I was your
father I don't know I don't know what
I'm saying but hey good job man let's
move on to Lester Lester's got some big
shoes to fill after Luke but I think he
he's got a good chance here with a fan
Tex anything we evolve ATX one of my
favorite cases right now it's so hot
right now a core i7 6700 K that predator
360 oh I'm a sucker for those predator
coolers never even seen one in person
but just actually I have my
brother-in-law
Kyle 2.0 has one in his definer 5 system
and is quite beautiful he's got a 240
though this is really really nice bro
hot damn hot damn that's why it's why I
called this this episode of booted hot
damn cuz hot damn man look at that look
at them kingpins two of them two 980ti
kingpins ah that that copper heatsink
those copper heat sinks just looks so
sexy so sexy and great sleeping I
particularly like how your PCIe cables
really match up with your RAM like the
Trident Z memory that you've got there
the black and red staggered kind of
strike penis going on matches perfectly
with your your video card cables
excellent and I also do love those
Corsair SP fans and that that airflow
fan in the back all those red rangs
killing it killing it however I just
noticed you've got a flexi a little
bendy SLI bridge and I believe did let's
go back to Luke Luke add one to Luke you
also had you're also guilty of the Flexi
the bendy ribbon cable ribbon style I
should say SLI bridge and I'm not one to
talk people i I had a ribbons
SLI bridge on hotline for like the
longest time it wasn't until like a
couple months ago when I finally manned
up and and got an EVGA sli bridge we all
remember that video so I'm not one to
talk however just looking out for y'all
for Luke and Lester I would definitely
recommend going for at least a a hard
hard rigid SLI bridge just to class up
your system get that glassy Gumby
looking thing out of there the damn damn
Sun I like that SOC board - it's got
some orange accents on it like via the
SSE Force does and it doesn't exactly
match up with the rest of the theme
color however it doesn't look horrible
at all it looks good
you know orange isn't too far off from
red I guess and you get some sexy LED
action here there are a bit of hot spots
and I think with uh with all the
hardware you've got in here it might be
tricky to have much place placement find
good placement for uh for your LEDs so
there is a bit of hotspot areas up at
the top by your vrm heatsink and by your
sli bridge making it even more glossy
that's never good I don't know maybe
figure out a way to fix that in the
future but very nice cable training
indeed cable training is stellar stellar
stuff Lester Luke and Lester have really
set the stage for today's episode so I
feel sorry for whoever's going after
them however man who is bringing the
heat with his H 440 razor Edition system
reckon to 4790k
got a z97 ex game + motherboard from
gigabyte 16 gigs again of trident memory
we've got the light a truck Trident
Series Rams in this episode of booted
and gtx 980ti hybrid let's take a look
at that a little bit closer I really
like how you've done the tubing for the
for the video card for the hybrid one of
the best tubing jobs that I've seen with
that card it's just kind of
makes this really nice elegant shape and
doesn't really get in the way of like
your CPU water block or anything like
that very nice you've also swapped out
some of the fans in your case as well as
the radiator fan with uh with those LED
course air fans I'm sure in green
very nice cable training as well and
you've also spray-painted your uh the
ring the ring little ring pop out ring
on your water block as well as them
Trident Rams because I know I know they
don't come in green so you must have
done that yourself which kudos to you
that looks very natural
at least from this angle these builds
are so sexy I want all of them makes me
want to build a new system for myself ah
yes yes I'm really glad that they are
green LED fans it would have been really
jarring and disappointing had they been
like blue
despite given your color scheme for
everything else very very nice man ooh I
hope I'm pronouncing your name right -
knowing me I'm not damn son hey I'm
Daniel yeah man
this looks good bro this looks good
search are you guys are you guys are
gonna I don't want to be you guys I'm
glad I don't have to vote on any of
these systems I just look to give the
hard work to you let's let's move on to
fam h fo fo - case it's got another back
to back h 440s i don't even plan it that
way but you've got a 4690k
core i5 and a gtx 980ti hybrid now I
like the implementation of the hybrid
here because it's just it has this nice
kind of gold finish on the side and also
on the underside the underbelly of it as
well and it that that gold tint doesn't
often match with much in in your typical
custom build these days however you've
really ran with the theme here going
with a black white and gold got that
nice z97 pro motherboard from asus taken
advantage of when a see some
motherboards were all gold not too long
ago and and also that corsair pro ddr3
the Vengeance pro i'm i should say
with them gold Rams that get it again
with the gold Rams and you spray-painted
the rings on your Corsair fans there for
your radiator and the air airflow oh
very nice I will admit I'm not the
biggest fan of the the spiral e coils
around the tubes I don't know if there's
a proper name for those I just called
them spiraling coils
I guess if their coils I don't really
need to say spiral it's redundant
however it does add some personality
that's for sure I can dig it I can dig
it yo and cable management seems to be
on point
looks like you've just gone with some
maybe the the default cables the default
power supply cables from that supernova
they are kind of the the matte black
finish and here's a side angle shot with
the the front panel taken off and you
even you've even spray-painted the rings
on on the fans at the front which aren't
even visible to anyone seeing your rig
unless it's got the thing torn up so
just a lot of attention to detail right
here and doesn't look like you have any
LEDs but that's that's perfectly fine
some people don't like LEDs sometimes I
hate having LEDs and hot line I just
turn him off but this is a very this is
probably the most unique build here well
I don't know the Stark Industries one
from Luke is also pretty unique but you
don't see too many gold themed systems
and when you do they're either really
good or horrible I feel like that's just
the case with with gold themed pcs and
it seems like this one's really good I
would call this one really good this is
the success well done fam let's move on
to our last contender here for today
which is Yoshi Oh rockin and in win h
805 I really like this case another case
that I have seen the person a few times
but never had the privilege of working
with or building in myself however I
really do like the way this chassis
looks and when just kills it when it
comes to just innovatively beautiful
chassis as as like dysfunctional as they
may be the
is always on point oftentimes nine out
of ten so let's see what you did inside
of this particular niche of a case well
the 6700 K and r9 390x gaming board
board card from MSI like that your Arak
and AMD therefore the graphics to 512
gig Samsung 850 pro SSDs it's definitely
no shortage of storage here especially
with those 2 4 terabyte WD blues and
gigabyte z170 ex-gay mning 7 motherboard
man this thing looks really like looks
very sporty looks very it looks very
sporty which is a good thing you pulled
it off nicely take a look at the money
shot here well again with these portrait
pics you guys are killing me with these
portrait pictures but sometimes the
systems are just so good that when I get
a submission and like half the pictures
are in portrait I still have to accept
it because it would just be so such a
waste to not feature these really nice
systems but freaking for future
reference people landscape only I would
very much appreciate it so the viewers
I'm sure again with that trident memory
got some tried NC this probably you
probably have the cleanest cable uh
sleeving here as far as the training
goes definitely the cleanest out of the
bunch and i think there's another
picture here with LEDs on oh this case I
really love the internal layout of some
in win cases again like I said they're
not the most functional at times but
they are super unique and look at that
 oh you've got some ice mods or RGB
LED strips in here also ice mods for the
cables and look at that the red glow on
the front of the the in win case it's
just freakin mesmerizing I love it I
love it
and also that fan in the back is a white
LED it looks like yes yes killing it
killing it Yoshi
Oh all these systems are so nice just
want to stick my wiener and all of them
okay that's that's enough for that I'm
gonna go ahead and prompt my beautiful
wife Heather who is on the other line
the other line too now paste a link in
chat that you will all go to and vote on
your favorite PC that we have talked
about here today that we've gone over
remember you can only vote for one you
can try voting for more than one or
voting twice on the same PC it will not
work even though it seems that way it's
just how the the site is designed but
please go go ahead and take your time
this is a big decision that I am
entrusting all of you with why I have no
idea but yeah go ahead and do that and
just really quick for those of you who
came late to the show
freaking cable Maude they are they are
the man they are the men that's sexist
they are the men and women they are the
people who are giving you a stellar
discount of 20% off of anything cable
Maude on the performance pcs com website
so link in the description below
use the code cable Maude 20 which is
valid from starting now till the 23rd of
this month so just use it just just use
it now though why wait why wait you're
good if you wait you're just gonna
forget and then it's gonna be like the
24th and you're gonna remember you like
 I should have done it when Kyle
told me to so listen to me listen to me
all right thanks cable mud and again
they are they just announced that
they've released their their new PT
plastic nylon sleeping as well so make
sure to look out for that if you want
more options than then than just their
already awesome paracord sleeping which
they call mod flex and the new one that
they've just released is called mod mesh
suite oh oh all right y'all
have you guys voted have you guys voted
yet I am very anxious to see who you
guys voted for I don't even know I never
know I never know who I'm gonna vote for
but it's it's time for epic dramatic
voting music so let's let's do this
alright we've got four five options here
Luke with the Stark Industries amazing
casemod system and we had Lester with
that beautiful black and red and those
kingpins my god with that 360 rad from
prep the predator ek we need molester in
our lives man we need molester then we
also got we had man who enlarge this a
bit so you can see man who's sorry
you're cut off at the bottom there very
very beautiful H for 40 razor addition
system at the all green and we had fan
with the gold very beautiful gold system
and finally Yoshi with that amazing in
wind case who's it gonna be y'all who's
it gonna be because really at the end of
the day only one of these guys can go on
to the next round and the other four
will be booted so who is it who is it
Luke I'm not your father
whoo all right Luke yes yes yes yeah I'm
really glad that Luke won at least this
round because he put a lot of work and
you can just you can see the love and
dedication and time that he put into
actually getting the system going and
the fact that he's got a 3770k and nine
ATS means he's been working on the
system probably for a long time he
started you know three four years ago
perhaps whenever that chip was hot so to
speak and and it's just been iterating
it over time and I really like that
instead of just you know
scrapping the whole thing every two
years and building something new he's
been just improving upon it it's never
done and that's what I really like about
this approach and custom pcs in general
very well done Luke I love you you are
my homeboy
and thank you very much - there am some
here some beer baby oil thank you for
the donation yes I know I should just
awesome one of these days one of these
days Paul and I are just gonna kick off
awesome hardware by pouring baby baby
oil all over each other
that'll be but that'll be the whole show
it'll be three minutes long and it will
be the best show ever
also Quang Quang I always have to say
your name like that any time you donate
it just gives me a reason to say Quang
why am I still showing you guys the
results here Quang thank you for the
donation down the rest of your bubbly
before you show the results oh sorry I
missed that
I missed that it's not bubbly its wine
wine is anything but bubbly although I
will down it I'm gonna I'm gonna kill
this I'm gonna chug this wine just for
you all one and a half sips you ready
I'm gonna crush it Oh
hard core I go hard
yo that's you see that play that replay
that in slow motion when you get a
chance that was freaking awesome okay
that's all for booted before before you
go don't tune out yet guys many viewers
we got here there's about 800 of you
watching you guys like to watch you guys
are all creepy bastards all right before
you guys go in case you're interested in
submitting your pcs to next season
booted submissions are now open yes they
are let me go ahead and exactly show you
where to go I don't know if there's a
link in the description but if there
isn't you can go to awesomesauce
network.com and then you'll see you know
on the right hand side enter booted or
whatever so I'm submitting or I'm now
accepting submissions
however season 5 is going to be a custom
water cooled season so only such rigs
will be eligible if you have a custom
Cup water cool build submit that it
should also be consider
high-end which I think if most pcs are
custom water cooled to some degree they
will be high end there is no min or max
limit on price though doesn't matter if
your systems you know $1,000 or $5,000
it really doesn't matter as long as
there's custom water cooling in there
and and you would consider it high-end I
don't think anyone's gonna be like water
cooling their their core i3 s or you
know their GTX 960 s so but yeah go
ahead and head over to the awesomesauce
Network website submit your there
and read the instructions carefully guys
otherwise you will be disqualified and
it will be very sad who else we got here
somebody else yes Todd thank you for the
donation appreciate that Johnson back to
you brother
always looking for a firm Johnson if you
know what I mean so yes and in case you
guys didn't know or didn't hear already
season five of booted will be starting
in July there is no booted for June next
month there will be no booted because I
will be in Taiwan type Taipei Taiwan for
copy tech so you can be looking forward
to all the coverage that I'll be giving
during that week but it's just gonna be
a crazy month so I don't want to try to
rush booted next month so again season 5
is going to be starting in July and it's
gonna be custom water cooled thing go
ahead and submit your PCs now your
custom water cooled rigs you have until
this Friday to do it the 23rd is that
correct no the 20th to the 20th this
Friday the 20th not the 23rd all right
and now we're we're going back to the
the hard core the dramatic voting music
so that's pretty much it I'm just
rambling here I just want to hang out
with you guys but I can't because I have
to go eat dinner my wife is probably
angry at me because she has to help
moderate the the chat as long as this
show is going so again if you want to
catch booted live you have no idea when
it starts or when it goes on its Mondays
at 5:30 p.m. Pacific on gaming dot
youtube.com slash awesomesauce network
you can follow me on twitter at forever
kyle for updates and next week is going
to be the season finale of season 4
exciting stuff we've got three very
strong contenders and it's up to you
guys to decide which one will go home
and take home the grand prize so thank
you guys so much for tuning in I'm gonna
go have dinner hope you all have an
awesome night and stay tuned for a very
special tech video it should be dropping
sometime tomorrow I'm not at real
liberty to say what it is some of you
might have a guess may have a hunch as
to what that could be but that should be
dropping sometime early tomorrow so keep
your eyes peeled for that there's the
sign language repealed and that's the
sign language for that okay I'm done
being offensive I will see you guys very
soon if not later and good night I love
you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
