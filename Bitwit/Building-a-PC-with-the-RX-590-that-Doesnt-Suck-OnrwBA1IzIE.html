PC this one's gonna be aimed at 1080p
gaming because let's face it well we've
got all these fancy 4k and even 8k
monitors out there who is really gaining
on him no one
well maybe the 1% of fancy-pants gamers
out there but screw those guys it's all
about 1080p gaming all right that's
where the mainstream is at and wouldn't
you know it today marks the launch of a
brand-new video card that's just perfect
for gaming it's such a resolution this
is the AMD Radeon rx 590 specifically
the one from XFX this is their new Fat
Boy officially the coolest name of any
ad board partner card I have ever heard
not only is this rx 590 thick where it
counts it's also rocking a new 12
nanometer architecture meaning it's got
higher clock speeds and better power
efficiency than the existing rx 5 80
with a starting MSRP of 279 us you can
position this card it's somewhere
between an rx 580 and an RX Vega 56
that's on the AMD site if we're talking
Nvidia then this card's performance is
probably sandwiched between gtx 1066
gigabyte and the gtx 1070 and in that
case i would expect this card to produce
a fine and smooth 1080p gaming
experience at max settings across the
board in most titles rest assured we'll
take this build for a quick spin once
it's all assembled but for now let's
move on to the rest of our hardware here
we've got an AMD Rison 520 600 this is
the non xq 6 cores 12 threads great
overclock ability includes a pretty
decent stock cooler and it's pretty much
one of the best bang for the buck
options in the cpu market as of now
we're pairing that with a be 450 i horas
pro Wi-Fi so we've gone mini ITX here
where we're building a small form-factor
tower super excited about that but
despite its size this boards actually
packing quite a few features including
nvme i'm not to support we've got intel
gigabit lan we've got a tow 2.11 AC
Wi-Fi onboard which is great for small
form-factor builds and the robust vrm
solution is gonna be great for
overclocking from memory we have a 16
gigabyte dual channel kits of T force
nighthawk RGB ddr4 3000 speed and
hopefully we can even overclock that a
bit as fast memory frequency will
definitely benefit this Rison build for
storage we have a 2 terabyte WD black
hard drive which has a tried and true
mechanical option and for our boot drive
we have a 240 gig Toshiba OC ZTR 200
using their in-house BICS NAND flash
which offers solid middle-of-the-road
performance well maintained
a super attractive price per gig
powering the system is the coolermaster
V 750 fully modular 80 plus gold
certified power supply this is probably
a bit more wattage than we need for this
build but it definitely gives us some
Headroom if we wanted to upgrade our CPU
or GPU down the line especially because
we're rocking such a flexible a m4
platform and we have plenty of room in
our case for full-size GPUs if we did
want to slot out that rx 590 down the
line so finally we have our case the
metallic gear Neogene mini it's a mini
tower and for those of you who didn't
know metallic gear is actually a new
line of gaming cases from the folks over
fantex now fantex is known for their
premium quality chassis and they're
really not skimping on quality here but
what they are doing is making this line
of cases a bit more affordable and more
practical for the average gamer I'm
excited because I've never worked with a
metallic gear case before and I'll be
sure to let you guys know what my
experience with it is like those are all
the parts people links to all this stuff
in the description below as always
without further ado let's get building
this 1080p gaming system for 2018
all right so the build is done pretty
straightforward and sucking good so far
I actually really like this case from
metallic gear slash fan text the Neogene
mini has left me impressed so far it's a
relatively small case tiny footprint but
it doesn't feel super cramped inside
there's even room for a longer power
supply or graphics card if we wanted to
drop those in there's a 120 millimeter
RGB fan that's included at the front
although you could populate that area
with up to a 280 millimeter radiator if
you wanted to you can see there's
ventilation strips on either side here
and there's about an inch of space
between the front fan in the front panel
of course further testing would need to
be done to determine the effectiveness
of this ventilation setup here at the
front there's also room for a 240
millimeter radiator right where the hard
drive is there's also a removable
magnetic dust filter behind that area so
fan tix is really thought of everything
as usual when it comes to case design I
do have a big gripe with this case
though and that's these two screws right
here holding the frame in place they're
actually protruding so far to the point
where when you mount your power supply
in those screws scratch up against the
side I guess I could have removed those
screws first but it didn't mention
anything about that in the manual so
most people are just gonna install it
like a regular PSU and probably scratch
up that portion of their units of course
you can't see it so it's probably not a
big deal for most people but it does
leave a pretty bad gash on there if you
don't remove those screws first there's
actually no option for mounting your GPU
in the more traditional horizontal
position in this chassis which I kind of
like I'm digging the the vertical vibe
here and they even gave you three slots
so even if you have a triple slot card
you should be totally fine there and
with this card in particular we have
well over an interest space between
these fans and the side panels so that's
great for cooling obviously one thing to
bear in mind with this vertical
orientation though is that it may lead
to higher CPU temperatures just because
we're ejecting hot air at the top of the
card and it's just so it's so close to
the CPU cooler there that I would
imagine it might raise it a couple
degrees and also notice that the card is
partially covering the CPU cooler so
your CPU cooler high clearance is
limited in this case if you are going to
be using a discrete GPU around this size
there was actually plenty of space on
the back for cable management actually
right behind the power supply is
probably the the most area you have
stashing cables the side panel went on
just fine after all was said and done
the last little thing I'll say about
this case is that I liked how they went
about covering the power supply cool
solution they've just got sort of a
pattern design there that matches the
front and you don't need a power supply
shroud or any other steel or you know
whatever it's just it's just very clean
it's very clean so I also like the
pattern a lot more now that the builds
assemble that wasn't super sold on it
beforehand but that's the Neogene mini
from metallic gear again links to all
this stuff in the description but this
is not a case review people so why don't
we go ahead and connect some peripherals
to this thing and see how she games
alright so quick side note we have
relocated to my house because I realized
that the external drive with all my game
is on it was at home so just a quick
side note there but here we are in GTA 5
with a nice blend of high and very high
settings across the board we're using 2
X MSA a and we're getting anywhere from
60 to 80 FPS on average you can see the
frame counter at the top left there as
we drive through the streets of Los
Santos clearly our little rig here
specifically the RX 590 and Rison 5 2600
are doing a bang-up job of handling GTA
5 at 1080p at fairly high settings let's
see what else I can do jumping into some
doom 1080p ultra settings damn you ugly
here we go alright getting some really
good frame rates here in this feels this
feels really quick obviously high frame
rates we really benefit a fast-paced
game like doom eaten mob bullets mate oh
God well that was quick now obviously in
any game your performance is gonna vary
based on where you are in the game the
environment matters you know what's
going on on screen but at least in this
particular room we saw a very nice frame
rate ranging anywhere from 80 to 100 FPS
battlefield 1 this is the last game
we're testing today oh good anyway we're
playing multiplayer because most people
who play this game play multiplayer so
she's more addictive of a real world
experience all right so we're rolling
around here 1920 by 1080 this is DirectX
11 so I can show you the fraps counter
up top and we're running at the ultra
preset oh no nope someone's shooting
someone's shooting I just caught on I
okay well
alright you can see we're getting a
strong 100 to 120 fps hundred and thirty
in some cases it's not gonna help me be
a better gamer though
unfortunately Oh maybe it will oh god I
spoke too soon what a hacker he hacked
right through that piece of air that was
between us so it would seem that this
system is pretty well equipped to handle
1080p gaming and I'm dead so there it is
guys one shining example of a mid-range
gaming PC here at the tail end of 2018
I'm actually really happy with how the
bill turned out both aesthetically and
from a performance standpoint and the RX
590 certainly provides a pretty decent
stopgap or so it seems
between a gtx 1060 and 1070 I'm sure by
now you've probably already seen one or
two rx 590 reviews with actual benchmark
graphs unlike this video if you have let
me know what you think about the new
card in the comments be live before you
go don't forget to toss a look on this
video if you enjoyed it and get
subscribed for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon thanks for watching guys
have a good one and I'll see y'all in
the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
