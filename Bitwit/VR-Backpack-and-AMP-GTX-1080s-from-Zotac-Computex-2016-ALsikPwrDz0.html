computex 2016 has been overclocked by
gigabyte fantex cable mud ng scale
making the contents of this video highly
unstable click the links in the
description for more info what's up guys
I'm now here at the zotac booth is
computex day 3 although I'm probably
uploading all this stuff out of order so
it prolly shouldn't been said however
I'm taking a look right now at their
Magnus en 980 now this is basically a
little mini PC but don't be fooled by
its size it's actually packing some
pretty hefty hardware so basically what
we're rocking here is a core i5 6400 we
are rocking skylake 16 gigs of ddr3
actually that's ddr3l I believe yes at
1600 and we've also got a GTX 980 full
desktop graphics so we're not dealing
with a mobile processor here so it's
actually going to be able to deliver all
the frame rates you might need for
high-end gaming experience and also if
you look over here it's completely
water-cooled the CPU and the GPU are
both water-cooled which is pretty
awesome so you're going to be able to
overclock without you know actually
overheating or thermal throttling things
like that so it's got a pretty hefty
looking configuration here and they've
done a really nice job keeping it super
compact you also have an m2 slot it is
still sada so they don't have the PCIe
integration yet but you got an m2 you've
also got room for an SSD the one that
comes with i believe is 120 gigs you
can't upgrade both your storage
configuration and your memory no problem
just by opening up the box with a few
screws but equally exciting if not more
so about this product is that it's
actually using the same internals that's
going to be going into zou Tech's vr
backpack which is basically going to be
great for playing the are without any
kind of tethering from your freaking
headset which is really annoying we
actually check this out at the MSI booth
recently and they had their own version
of this but it was a larger kind of like
hardshell case zotac has taken a
completely different approach here and
made it more like a backpack like this
kind of more of a fabric design and that
keeps it a little bit lighter and also
more comfortable in my opinion now of
course they haven't done a complete
transfer of the Magnus Ian 980 into the
the zotac backpack which right now
doesn't have a name so instead of water
cooling they've stuck with air cooling
for the backpack just because I don't
know lots of movement and water cooling
don't really mix all that well they've
also kind of rearranged the inner
words to make it a lot flatter to fit in
a backpack design battery time right now
is well we can't really go into detail
about the battery because zotac is still
trying to find a good battery vendor to
work with to bring this thing to the
market so we don't know exactly what the
game time is right now the version of
the rockin is anywhere from one to two
hours of game time which is pretty good
I actually pitched them the idea of
having hot swappable batteries so
instead of having to charge it you know
charge the lithium-ion battery every
time it dies you can just swap him out
for uninterruptedly in play which I
think would be a really cool idea also
they didn't really have the holsters on
the backpack like we saw at the MSI
booth which I also thought they should
implement so altogether pretty cool
stuff here but we also have some stuff
with graphics so this is the GTX 1080
amp edition and amp extreme so the amp
edition is going to be a little bit more
cost friendly it's not got quite all the
bells and whistles but it's still a
really powerful card it's got two large
fans over a pretty beefy heatsink and
you do have RGB LEDs that are supported
by the firestorm software from zotac so
you've got LEDs pretty much on the amp
addition on the front you've got two
little accents on the front and then
you've got the zotac branding at I guess
the other front of the card you can see
this is a custom PCB design because
there are two 8-pin PCIe connector so
it's going to be great for overclocking
a very nice backplate it's kind of a
brushed aluminum it's got sort of an
anodized gray as well as some yellow
accents right there but altogether a
really solid piece of hardware standard
display io on the back there and then
moving on to the amp extreme this is
obviously they're more high-end version
we've got three fans here they are a bit
smaller but you do have a third one and
they do have kind of like a nice sharper
design which I really like the aesthetic
there you can also see it is also
featuring RGB LEDs both on the front
there's a little push to push the limit
icon that will light up as well as zotac
on the the the faceplate of the card and
as well as the backplate so the push the
limit logo will actually light up in
whatever color you choose and the push
the limit and the other RGB LEDs on the
card can be controlled independently of
each other so if you want to switch it
up and actually have multiple colors all
around this card you could do so again
QA pin PCIe connectors so you're going
to be getting some excellent power
delivery to overclock this thing
just look how friggin beefy this thing
is so it is a 2 slot card however the
thickness of the cooler almost reaches
three slots so you're gonna have to keep
that into consideration when trying to
find this space for this in your case
don't really have much else to say here
at this point for zotac keep an eye out
for these cards they're going to be
launching very soon and that's going to
do it for now be sure to also check out
the links in the description below for
my sponsors thinking huge shout-out to
gigabyte fantex g.skill and cable mod
i'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
