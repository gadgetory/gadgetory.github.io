super excited for this one because
unlike the other two clients that we've
had so far in the series this is an
extremely high-end system that needs
virtually zero performance upgrades but
could use all the help it can get in the
aesthetics department the H 500 I from
NZXT carries a small footprint without
compromising on features like flexible
hardware configurations a removable
radiator bracket for easy installation
and stellar cable management for a
tidier system gamin style with the
tempered glass side panel integrated RGB
lighting and a built-in cam powered
smart device to manage your lighting and
fans do more with less in the H 500 I
click the link below to learn more this
is Adam gaming PC and it's the first
ring he's ever assembled so I will
commend him on his part selection we've
got an incredible lineup of hardware
here including an Intel Core i7 6700 K
on top of an msi z170a m7 gaming
motherboard 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance
lpx ddr4 at 3200 speed and msi geforce
r-tx 28 epi gaming x-tree and a handful
of other premium components including a
fractal design to find our v chassis
that make this a dream build for any
gamer but what i love most about this
rig and how it pertains to this series
is that it shows that you can spend some
serious coin and drop in some really
high-end hardware into your system and
still not turn any heads you know if I'm
being honest the system looks about as
plain as a saltine cracker
there's no cosmetic flair no style of
any kind to really tell people that this
is a special build so that's what I want
to do today is make this system look as
good as it performs and I think we can
do that with just a couple simple
changes but for now let's talk some more
 on Adams build this is fun for
starters we've got this Noctua cooler I
believe it's an Nhu 14s with mismatched
fans I mean the brown is already ugly
enough Adam you had to you had to throw
the black one on there to contrast even
more horrific alee with the brown one
like what what's going on
might as well swap out that nasty
exhaust fan too they perform great don't
get me wrong everyone knows it but
they're just hideous especially if
you're not going to own that color
scheme of
OOP that's all I see with this poop so
this whole area obviously needs work
you've got some red accents on your z170
board back there that you can't really
see anyway because they're being covered
up by this massive card and the cooler
is pretty massive too when you have both
of those fans on there you've got a few
red accents on your graphics card and on
this GPU bracket that's not even
touching your GPU it's just making your
card look thicker
what are you compensating for something
Adam I say we just get rid of the red
and throw some RGB
it doesn't seem like you've really owned
the red here anyway there are no notable
red accents elsewhere in the system it
just seems kind of like an afterthought
they've got this hideous sticker on the
power supply why why do you guys keep
the stickers the the rail specs on here
makes me makes me mad just me I'm sooo
pissed it's tough I'd comment on the
cable management if there was any weight
all these loose cables you got a 2 pin
another 8 pin PCI just just hanging out
I don't know what kind of pets or
animals you have at home but I know you
at least have a bird because there's a
crow's nest right above your freaking
hard drive cage it's up of that Adam huh
I see you got another nest by your power
supply hey it's a duplex alright alright
I'll give you a break for now Adam lucky
for you there's still hope we can still
turn this ship around alright so I think
the first thing we want to do here is
take care of the color situation we
really need to get rid of these red
accents on the graphics card and the
motherboard heat sinks so we can
actually prep the system for some
serious RGB action so let's get her done
Adam prepare to have your PC pimped
so our paint job for this project is
pretty much out of the way now the
graphics card is still drying off so
you'll get a closer look at that later
and we blacked out the motherboard as
best we could you can see we've still
got some we've got a red dragon of the
MSI dragon and some thin lines on the
chipset heatsink that were just too
difficult to mask off and we didn't want
to risk messing anything up so we're
leaving them there Plus once the
graphics cards installed it's gonna be
covering that up completely more or less
and this is Adam's not to a cooler like
I said before it's a great unit it's
just an eyesore so we want to change
that but at the same time we don't want
to sacrifice not two levels of
performance so what I have here is an
out to it and HD 15s a great cooler it's
kind of the inverse of this one in terms
of design we're instead of having a
single heatsink Tower and a fan on
either side it has dual heatsink towers
and a single fan in between them the
problem is is that this cooler is just
as hideous out of the box as this one
fortunately we have some chrome axe fans
and accessories to help us along there
so chrome axe for those of you who don't
know is the best thing to have ever
possibly happened to nock to a when it
comes to aesthetics it's basically their
line of fans and accessories that
complement their existing coolers to
take them from super ugly to super
attractive is more or less the
high-level explanation so we have some
cover plates for our heat sinks that
don't impede performance whatsoever
along with an NF a 15 HS which is going
to be the fan that we put in between
those heat sinks and an
a14 which is going to replace the
existing rear exhaust fan both of the
fans are fully blacked out and come
included with a bunch of rubber corners
in various colors so you can kind of
customize it to your liking there so
what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
populate the board with the CPU and
memory and then we're gonna mount this
cooling solution and see how it looks
before we move on to the next step so
let's get to
okay you guys can see by now that I've
decided to add some white accents into
Adams build for a couple reasons one it
adds a bit of a dynamic look to the
system overall instead of just one color
there's more you can do the more colors
you add obviously we don't want to go
crazy but I think a nice two-tone black
and white is pretty classic and also
white just reflects lighting a lot
better reflects RGB a lot better than
just straight black does and then we've
got his power supply the 850 g3 so we're
actually to remove that sticker that I
mentioned before with a little heat gun
this is a heat gun not not an air
cooling fan like some people on this
channel think and then the other thing
that we want to do here is his SSD is
mounted in a large drive cage I feel
like it's overkill to have that huge
cage just for a two and a half inch
drive so I'm gonna remove that cage
especially they look kind of weird here
in 2018 when most Drive cages are now
underneath a power supply completely out
of sight so I'm gonna get rid of that
and instead mount his two and a half
inch drive against the backside panel
his right side panel you see I've also
got some black and white sleeved cables
from cable mod for our SSD and what's
even more exciting to top this all off
is that when Adam handed off his system
to me he also brought along with him two
tempered glass side panel upgrades for
the define r5 it's just an add-on item
that you can purchase separately and
again guys I'll drop links to all this
stuff in the description so even have to
hunt for it but what's exciting about
the right panel now being made of glass
is that it's gonna give a floating
effect to our SSD once it's mounted
there which I think will look pretty
cool assuming I don't mess it up
all right we are fast approaching the
finish line people just a few more
things and we're good to go we've got
our cable mud wide beam LED strip is
actually an RGB kit I should say with a
controller and all that it's super fun
we also have some cable mod cables these
are not extensions these are the Pro
Series full-length cables specifically
for the EVGA 850 g3 because we don't
have a power supply shroud I wanted to
go with full-length cables just so we
get it all nice and clean the whole way
through I'm also throwing in a couple
wide expansion slots this is just a
quick and easy way to give us a more
cohesive look as these will match nicely
and sort of complement the other white
accents in the build and finally you
guys will be able to take a look at the
GPU in its final form we didn't really
do much just spray painted those red
accents in white but sometimes a little
can go a long way so we'll just have to
see how it turned out in a moment but
apart from that guys I can't wait to see
this build finished I know Adam must be
dying to see it so without further ado
let's get her down
I don't get my hair stuck in that fan
scary alright so here it is
what's pretty good man
damn it turned out so well okay there
was one thing one thing that I could
change I was actually sort of an
oversight on my end the cable mod say
the power cable that I got for the SSD
is too short and so originally I don't
know if you could tell the b-roll but I
had that SSD mounted quite a bit higher
but I had to bring it down because the
cable just wouldn't reach so I would
prefer it a little bit higher I think it
fills up some of that empty space up
there but Adam might not mind it of
course he could always swap it out down
the line if he so chooses
apart from that though chrome axe
knocked to a cooler just to think this
table just lifted an inch or two and
then these three cables coming from the
video card oh my gosh it just screamed
power I'm getting fired up I'm getting
so fired up I got to calm down I really
love this thing but of course Adams
response is really the one that matters
here so why don't we go ahead and see
what he thinks of his new pimped out PC
alright Adam thank you for being here
I'm just actually kind of curious was it
hard not having your system for like a
week or two I feel to have my old gaming
laptops from years ago aside right
1/4000 like 13 just well I apologize for
that I really do I'm sure that's tough
but hopefully it was worth the wait I
think you have any expectations off the
bed better cubic management I'm horrible
at you I think I think that was a given
I think anyone could have guessed that
now you actually have BitLocker on here
right so if I don't type in the password
within like a minute or so the system
will shut itself off right so at some
point I'm gonna turn it on but it might
turn off midway through the shot just so
you guys at home know that I didn't
break his computer all right you ready
yeah
all right here it is new system so yeah
that
really nice it's different it's
different than it was but we didn't
change a whole lot to be honest all the
core components are the same we did a
paint job on the board to sort of black
out the the red accents obviously
sticking RGB in there definitely
benefits from from having a more neutral
tone this is actually you can see an
upgraded cooler but still not to a we
just kind of made it pretty with with a
chrome accent thank you again for
bringing in those those glass panels
that saved me some some work definitely
but I think it looks really good with
the with the SSD float in there thoughts
concerns well you said this was your
first bill Barry yeah yeah awesome
you honestly did a pretty good job for
your first build I will say though when
you watch this video back I did rip on
you please and the system ISIL but but
it was all in good fun it was just for
the video you did an excellent job I
hope you enjoy your new your new system
thanks max yeah appreciate ya thank you
guys for watching this video thank you
Adam for being here if you guys liked
the video toss like on it get subscribed
and all that stuff and we'll see you
guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
