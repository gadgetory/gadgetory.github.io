info what's going on guys I once again
have dwarfed myself with a large pile of
hardware but that's okay this is an
exciting video actually I guess it's
yeah yeah it's I'm gonna say it's
exciting I feel really bad that I
haven't filled you guys in in a long
time having given you an update on the
whereabouts of hotline 2.0 so I thought
I would do this video where I reveal the
core specs that I will for sure be using
for this system and do a little
preliminary build without the custom
water cooling involved because all that
Hardware still needs needs to be sourced
but I have most of the core components
that will be going in to this highly
awaited successor some of these parts
are not finalized and some of them are
so I'm gonna quickly go over each one
and describe what's what let's go ahead
and start from this side we've got 220
80 TI RT x 20 80 T is from Nvidia these
are both founders Edition cards so
they've got reference PCBs which will
make it really easy to fit on some
custom blocks in the near future these
are now the fastest gaming graphics
cards on the market and when paired
together into a sli they will be the
fastest GPU configuration you can
possibly buy if you're talking about
gaming which is important because
hotline 2.0 is built is being built
exclusively for a gaming experience I
don't need it to do awesome editing and
rendering like I did with the original
hotline because I already have editing
systems for that so all the hardware you
see here has been hand-picked to deliver
the highest possible frame rates in-game
which is why these cards are so critical
to this build
now the motherboard I'm going with is
the asus rog Maximus 11 formula which
features these e 390 chipset and that
supports of course all of Intel's latest
ninth gen core processors I really like
this motherboard I was kind of blown
away by the aesthetic it's just it's
right up my alley I like it obviously
that's subjective but apart from that it
does have an ek backed vrm water block
on it which I feel like I kind of have
to use it be sort of a slap in the face
if I didn't especially if I'm trying to
get some gnarly overclocks on it and
it's got no shortage of RGB and just
endless come
Tiffany I think it's gonna be a
fantastic motherboard you might notice
that I'm not going the high-end desktop
route either with thread ripper or
skylake X that's because I think as a
gaming PC the the only CPU that's really
qualified for this job if I'm going
balls to the wall is the core I 999
hundred K now you'll notice that I don't
have a ninety nine hundred K with me
right now so this is a stand-in this is
an eighty seven hundred K from the 8th
gen but it's gonna be very easy to swap
out and stuff I'm not actually hooking
up like I said any custom water cooling
hardware today so this is just a fill in
but that 8 core 16 thread processor is
hopefully just gonna annihilate all the
games we throw at it and that should
also reduce as much bottlenecking as
possible with these two RT x 2080 t is
for system memory I have a kid here of
HyperX predator GB ddr4 29:33 this is
just a 16 gigabyte kit to buy a king
sticks this is also kind of a philan but
kind of not because I am planning to use
predator RGB for this build but I think
a more substantial kit is necessary for
for a system like this so I'll probably
get four dims in there I just populate
all those slots and it kind of looks a
little bit nicer too and we'll probably
go with 32 gigs I don't think I need
anything more than that for a gaming PC
specifically but I really do like the
look of these dims and if you remember
from hotline 1.0 I was also using HyperX
predator ddr4 but that was the non RGB
version so this is gonna pay sort of
omage to to the original build the
official boot drive for this system is
gonna be the samsung 970 evo m2 nvme SSD
250 gig capacity i usually don't go much
over 250 gigs for my boot drive i just
don't need it however as you might have
guessed i will also be adding additional
storage to the system later down the
line because 250 is clearly not going to
cut it just for the boot drive moving on
here we've got the XP 1200 M from
gigabyte this is actually their extreme
series extreme gaming series 1200 watt
unit 80 plus platinum fully modular
cables it's actually a great unit I've
been using it for testing quite a bit
that's been super reliable so far you
can see that I don't have any custom
sleeved extensions on hand right now I'm
still waiting on those those will look
really cool and they're all done but for
now I'm probably just gonna have to use
these stock cables of this power supply
for this build which is fair warning the
cables are gonna look kind of crappy and
then we also have a cooler the H 10 110
I this is again another placeholder
because we don't have the custom
we're cooling Hardware in here yet this
is a 280 millimeter liquid AO from
Corsair and it's a fantastic unit I'm
not going to talk too much about it
because we're not going to be putting it
in the final build and last but
certainly not least we have a case
picked out for hotline 2.0 this is the
fantex evolve x this case absolutely
blew me away at Computex this year I
love all the the improvements that
they've made to the front panel with the
RGB lighting and additional openings for
air flow and there's just a ton of other
features crammed into this thing it's
very conducive for custom water cooling
it's got tons of radiator support and
initially when I picked this case out
and decided this is the case I want I
was planning to do a dual system inside
of hot line 2.0 because you can actually
not do mini ITX board up at the top of
this chassis but then I realized that
would take away from the radiator
support for the primary build and I
think cooling is very important to
prioritize in the system like this so
I'm gonna be foregoing the dual system
for a single system just more
traditional and probably simpler that
way but very excited to be using this
case nonetheless those are all the
official core specs guys for hot line
2.0 I'm super excited if you'd like to
find links to all this stuff you can
check the description below but without
further ado let's get cracking on this
early stage assembly
thora she blows hotline 2 in her very
very early and unfinished stage it's
powerful in fact this is the most
powerful or the fastest gaming PC that
money can buy right now just days before
the launch of the 9900 Kay this thing's
a beast but it's not pretty per se I
wouldn't say the aesthetics are quite on
point yet because obviously there's
there's still much to be done especially
when you've got those nasty PCIe cables
I did manage to find a cheaper extension
for the 24 pin so that doesn't look as
bad still not great though and of course
we've you know I didn't really focus too
much on cable management here because
well this is a very early build we also
don't have any color coordination in
order as I mentioned in the last update
video hotline 2.0 they'll retain the
same fuchsia pink color but we may be
adding a splash of teal into the mix
whether that's going to be actually teal
painted components or just an RGB thing
I still undecided you can also see we
have a hard drive post error code that's
probably just because we don't have a
physical connected hard drive so nothing
to worry about there the motherboard
looks absolutely killer in this case and
I think it pairs really nicely with that
HyperX kit although I do need two extra
dims to really complete the picture also
something to be aware of the reflective
material on the BRM heat a water block
right there it's highly prone to
scratching and I did scratch up this one
on the left here with my finger and a
microfiber cloth both of those things
were enough to to put some scratches in
there so something to be aware of for
sure also the lower half of the board
isn't very visible right now because
you've got the graphics cards in there
once we swap those out for the single
slot GPU water blocks I think it'll be a
lot more visible all that beautiful RGB
underneath additionally we've got to cut
out for our power supply here looks
really nice the sticker on the power
supply however not so nice so I'll
probably have to heat gun that off at
some point just to clean it up a bit the
cable management was fantastic on the
back side like with those covers they're
completely tooless and they they pop on
and off very easily it's a really fun
case to build in and it didn't even feel
like I was cramming that much hardware
into it because the ease of use in
almost every area of the
your installation was just really smooth
with that removable bracket you can also
tell from this cameras perspective that
this is not the longest case in the
world it's it's not very deep so it
might be a challenge cramming all the
custom water cooling hardware that we
need into this chassis but I think we
could still get away with probably a 360
at the front and the top we'll just have
to double-check what kind of width we
can get away with at any rate you guys
I'm really excited to get this project
underway get it moving and stuff and I
hope you are too thank you so much for
watching this video leave me any
feedback down in the comments below and
Tessa like on this video if you enjoyed
it you can also check me out on
floatplane if you'd like to watch my
videos a whole week early without ads
for three bucks a month I'll put a link
for that in the video description till
next time guys thanks for watching have
a good one and I'll see you all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
