really have much time to prepare for my
half of the show at all today like I
literally spent maybe 15 minutes total
prepping for my half of the show just
quick disclaimer so if you guys are you
know why I even apologized expectations
down here I mean yeah their expectations
are already pretty low and that's that's
the beauty of this show is that we can
like have like bomb the worst episode
ever and people were like that's pretty
standard
that's pretty that's pretty pretty
normal for them it's not anything I
wasn't the ordinary so we kind of set
ourselves up for that in a good way but
we can we can still carry on here not
all is lost I still have some things
planned and we sell things we sell
things on transition from we're awful
we're providing a minimal entertainment
value but buy stuff from us yeah it I
mean you can't trust someone who's like
responsible all the time that's just the
lure machine clearly AI but my store is
bit
tech slash store got it there I have new
stuff ish new modes holiday this holiday
sales are booming people last chance new
mugs last chance to get these killer
deals until next Christmas that yes the
mouse pads have been selling really well
people have been telling me that they're
very high quality and they are they're
super nice buy stuff from Paul store to
my store is also a good story
Paul's hardware net the merch comes from
the same place and it is of equal equal
quality yeah which is good
- maybe slightly better no just go
exactly they're exactly the same okay
John oh wow so I could see John in the
back foot for every mousepad every mouse
pad of mine he sends out like right
before he boxes me he just like cuts it
yeah just like a giant small blemish
stat caps caps good then mugful mugs 15
ounces for ounces more than those crappy

mug that matches my shirt do you
designed do you design by Brian
yes maroc suit who has he's done quite a
few designs for us he will actually be I
think I picked him out for pin my P see
you later so well then we'll take a look
at one of his builds coming up soon
what a great tie-in yeah totally leg way
random plug let's let's say we set
expectations low that random then this
random wow that was so good how they
made that reference like you know pert
kind of like I had enough about
expectations yeah guys I see your
donations in super chat here on YouTube
I appreciate it we will be reading off
any messages or comments that you attach
to to send donations at the end of each
half of the show so we're not ignoring
you we're just saving it all for the end
if you have any questions feel free to
throw in you know $100 donation or every
awesome random number and we'll follow
pity guess um but let's dive in
you some of the news I think before we
do that well before we do that here
anymore you well we should mention that
occasionally we curse on the show so
right and then I was also gonna say we
should open this beer yeah the golden
drop which is a Belgian ale correctness
okay I haven't had this in probably
three or four years but I remember it
being quite tasty and strong if my
memory it is a 10.5 percent alcohol by
volume it's also forgotten that it has a
cork but it's got a little quirk on the
top you know this reminds me of right
now is um is the you know do you ever
watch tosh point-o his web Redemption I
mean I watched a few episodes isn't this
that was my web or depth
good lord wait what how did that why was
it so you could never open no not a
golden Drock they don't usually do that
most beer that is really is corked like
that really with the cage on top that's
the reason the cage is thanking Christ
okay
sorry the dogs are breaking okay we see
almost two did and I've got a a decent
amount of head there on mine see if I
can salvage well up tip will have to
raincheck that at a later time and put
what you're it's that you but yeah I'm
not sure either hey at least it wasn't
my eye this time you're right it's it
like a popped up it's like like like the
the travesty of your fail can be
directly like objectively measured by
how well it does on only as a twitch
clip and that's amazing that's mine so
give me this is yours okay thank you you
can you can give you a half-decent poor
there thank you think I'm so I wish I
could have said say is there anything
for you they gave by the time
then everything's fine I have like I'm
like I'm a normal person but when I like
open bottles with corks I'm autistic or
something I don't know
it's charming it's a sort of a charming
thing that's such difficulty with that
this is a perfect this is a perfect time
to also promote my beware of bottle neck
shirt on my store it's never been more
true and relevant here in 2017 go ahead
and check that out
good lord god help me god help us all
commemorating that here it is you know
when something like that happens you
gotta capitalize on it yeah absolutely
make it a new shirt and so it's the only
thing that I've ever done that's like
been noticed by the world is just
failing miseries it's been in a bunch of
like twitch fail round ups and stuff
hasn't it has it man over here yeah what
I haven't watched any of those where
like I just said you see these on Twitch
I mean they spend most of my time
watching twitch fail round ups that's
kind of a thing where do you have time
to watch me tell you I have a list I'll
share with you evolving that but no it's
like you because you can go and you know
there's certain ones that are more
popular they get lots of views and so
they just go and look at the ones I've
gotten lots of views oh yeah pups you
know right hammer together the video and
then put it on like crappy like top ten
chin top television channel yeah I mean
they do phenomenally well better than us
is the top ten popular things of popping
the people who are doing interesting
right now watch 10 haters and they
didn't spend any time benchmarking
anything they didn't have to benchmark a
single thing I didn't even sturdy they
making like injure way more money than
either of us combined yeah yeah they
they're way way more profitable they
just not fair it's just not fair this
life but that's good to know that my
fails being shared all over the world
but cheers Cheers
to you guys at home and I thank you also
I know do about this I think great where
did you bring this and thank you Joe
yeah I think
Yonex Joe yeah he's got a good taste
mm-hmm that's good that's good stuff
it's almost seven percent you said
almost like you got to chew it a little
bit ooh
I mean it feels like there's substance
to it it's all that you saying all right
that's a Houston chunk sea yeast chunks
all right let's talk about something
let's uh let's go into how do we have
any hardware oh good a segment where we
talk about hardware that's hot and hey
still-still aptly named bad still a very
aptly named segment starting with this
article from overclocked 3d net about an
AOC freesync display that's gonna appeal
to potentially appeal to a lot of you
budget gamers out there who are rockin
or plan to rock AMD GPUs supporting the
adaptive refresh rate tech technology
I'm like really good at like with just
like sabotage burps I show like just
impromptu burps all right I love our
show this is the AOC gaming g25 9-0 vxq
it's a 24 point 5-inch 1080p TN display
hear me out though that comes with a
listed freesync range of 30 to 75 which
is actually a pretty wide range for free
sync all things considered especially
when you consider the price tag of 159
that's that's great British pounds but
that's still pretty cheap give it us
what's what's given what's 159 give up
in u.s. it's probably the the US dollars
it probably about 200 no a little less
than that two hundo 213 yes about that's
still pretty good
honestly I personally 24.5 inches for
gaming is still a little small for me
that's actually the monitor that I
started out with when I first built my
computer my first PC back in 2011 was a
24 inch and it was fine then and I
scaled up 27 as I go I'll never go back
for 24 and then know my older y which is
a little different but anyway getting
off topic here pretty impressive for the
price all things considered we don't
know yet if it's gonna have aces support
it's probably gonna have an okay stand
which could be a deal-breaker for some
people I'm a huge I'm a stand fan
personally I need to have a solid stand
if I'm gonna dump some money into a
monitor
we got that's something you got to take
a stand up absolutely as well well said
well said Paul but you know it's it's a
it's a monitor there's but it's cool
because freesync
just got better with this particular
potential ii with this product in the
fact that the ranges is more is more is
wider has a wider range as i mentioned
that before hopefully we can see this
you know i don't know i'd like to see
this on a 27 inch panel that's IPS I
think the TN is probably gonna be the
deal breaker because most people when I
review or talk about a TN panel
everyone's like nope like everyone like
throws their hands up now with TN panels
and I kind of get like I fully get it
because I'm a sous sent me like a it was
a guy oh it was like a 200 Hertz
there was a 200 Hertz refresh rate here
over there that's no it's not as mean
originally he's looking this his rib
cage sure his belly is only ten eighty
only teeny so you know if this is you
have to be you have to have a really
small desk to use this monitor I feel
like it's gotta be like you know I
thought that said Mark Hamill at first
it's mark Campbell thank you Mark
Campbell Campbell be talking about Mark
Hamill Lanham yeah it's you know it's
it's not a high-end it's an entry-level
monitor for someone but I get it for
someone who for example maybe built like
a fort like the $400
Black Friday build that I put together
right like it's it's not really gonna be
able to handle much more than then than
1080p if you could bundle it with like
an RX 570 or 580 you know at a decent
price then might be a good entry-level
recent package I mean any probably can't
do that because they're still overpriced
anything's better than the the bullshit
gamer package is that AMD threw together
with with Rison and and what I'm gonna
tell it was that that was mainly
DeSantis the monitor the fixed monitor
that you had to buy like they made it
seem at first like you were getting you
know you could just take 2 or 3 2 bucks
off of any freesync monitor and be
awesome but no it's just that one
model right that they jack the price up
on before yeah the reach because of
retailers retailers were like messing
with the prices on their sites - that's
what this is bringing why is there
singing in the Christmas music I thought
there was no vocals and shit that's
supposed to be wasn't supposed to be
lyrics something back in the background
music only we can talk on our show we
don't have guests if you ever want to be
a guest about some hardware don't ask us
yeah we're terrible that way we're bad
we're just like no we like you just us
we're listening to a Mannheim
Steamroller Christmas by the way guys
the background music because this is the
username the Christmas episode meme
roller yeah I don't my my dad had this
home and I'm steamroller album when I
was growing up and I was always kind of
weird and it's just a little like I
don't know but but I said I just sucked
it up and it's it's it's been great so
like I want to talk to the 21 people who
disliked this album it just wasn't as
crispy christmas Caesar does when right
here it lacked Christmas spirit uploaded
by Betty P Jensen one of the songs had
lyrics in it I hope I could I could
understand that I hope that your video
doesn't get flagged because of that
possibly is it not possible that any any
humans you guys watched before watching
this video the money for that might be
going right to Mannheim Steamroller just
so going to point that out in case any
of you guys aren't down with Mannheim
Steamroller that's what I'm saying
making Bank off you guys but we can move
on to our next article here and possibly
as part of a hunt heavy hardware crucial
has released a new SSD the MX 500 this
is an article from Texas dotnet they
actually had got their hands on a one
terabyte model and they gave it very
high marks all around five year warranty
power loss immunity robust endurance
claims our last me and I think that I
think the big seller here though was
that it was it's faster than its
predecessor but at a very attractive
price if I'm reading this right
the nx500 current retail price two
hundred and fifty nine dollars for the
nine for the one terabyte is that for
the one terabyte is up to two terabyte
right so I'm wondering what does the
to $59 is that which capacity of it oh
no it is one terabyte it's one that says
482 oh you're right but it's right tech
so weird it's a weird chart I'm such a
weird little chart I'm like what which
one are you talking about students I
would assume that's I mean it's a great
price for one terabyte if it's the
cheapest one terabyte decent SSD that
you would actually trust on the market
right now but if it's the 480 that's
still decent but not quite as compelling
so I don't know I somebody someone can
okay somebody said thank you very much
Duncan roller this is why I love chat
and live-streaming because I really
don't have to do any of the work one
terabyte is 260 dollars assuming that
this person is true or right correct
then that's that's great that's great
deal
they gave it whatever they liked it the
only con that they had in their little
conclusion was that has a SATA interface
the only con was that it's not nvme it
doesn't have it's not the latest the
latest interface but that's still from
what it's for what it is that's a I
don't know if that's like a huge con
that's just sort of the circumstance of
the product they said it's a you know
but it's more of a budget fitting forget
fit and forget SSD what do they mean by
that fit and forget like set it and
forget it and like install it and then
don't worry about it anymore but that's
what I do with like my high-end nvme
drives - this says this is hex they're
there but you contact us 20 euros who
knows what they're smoking yeah they're
a UK you can't okay I knew that I was
just confirming I just like what's
double-checking so fit and forget SSD I
mean I mean unless you like raid and
stuff I didn't forget it
like not a George Foreman girl yeah that
is the only thing worthy of that that
title there but I like I like
you know English you've been euphemisms
and stuff though you know yeah give it
the old blob and squidge blob and
squidge live around the Thames punting
on the tempting on the Thames
MARY POPPINS ooh so everything that
reference to me when we were in the UK
oh yeah Nvidia's was at mobile it was
mobile Pascal when they took the GTX
1080 and put it in notebook yeah Pascal
and we were actually at the Thames River
yeah are you saying what do you want I
think I think I became a little british
that day because I think it was like
fuck who you want about like it just I
just said it like that in a British
accent and you're like it's from Mary
Poppins you know like it sounds like a
you know like really justify nothing you
say your wife punt on the judge the
other night but good times good time
everyone go to Europe support your
foreign foreign countries countries but
you know all right
JPD what does GP GP
is the brand that makes the wind to hem
hailed the gaming PC oh cool and this
article once again from hexxus has
revealed some details and benchmarks for
this device that's a very super niche
it's kind of interesting it actually hit
this summer which I'm surprises me
because I did not even hear about that I
never heard about this this is the first
time I'm hearing about it but I'm super
any reader yeah neither there's a GP
when to and the GPD win right this is
the second iteration or whatever so I
was like what where have I been
have you you said you you're from very
familiar with this oh yeah I've got five
of these at least hacked mind a blues
and I'm watched porn keep buying more
cuz they're so awesome and then you know
misplace him no I've never I've never do
this you know okay I thought it was
going crazy I was like I should read
more news
it's featuring an Intel Core M 3 7 y 3 0
kt link now it's kb like even though
it's some random mobile ski you've never
heard of with intel HD graphics six one
five so no discrete it's just uh
integrated which is probably what we
would expect from a unit like this eight
gigs of ram 128 gig m2 SSD i'd have to
imagine that to say the base six inch
720p IPS screen and it's good for based
on the benchmarks that it was showing
like a lot of the games that was testing
we're pretty low intensive when it comes
to GPU CPU utilization there's some
synthetics there with 3d mark eleven and
etc but some of the games that they were
showing like some you know playable
performance with included games like
Skyrim go to to legal legends unless
they were just laughing out loud over
something wow are you sure they meant
the game and then overwatch that's not
some terrible marks here again this is
720p you're getting well over 60 fps in
three of these title DOTA LOL can play
GTA 5 between 30 and 40 frames per
second at 720 on this little handhelds
computer yeah I mean that's yeah that's
kind of impressive you know yeah and I
mean I want more images of it like the
you know to look at the ergonomics and
stuff like that right also like
durability of the housing and that kind
of thing for portable like for handheld
games and stuff like that like if you
look at stuff like Nintendo doesn't
everything like so much of it it goes
beyond the the hardware capabilities as
far as what it can do graphically and so
much of is about like durability is like
you know you can have a seven-year-old
it Chuck's it when they died in the game
or something like that so um granted its
PC so maybe it's not aimed at quite the
same market but right yeah that's
interesting is there any price on it or
anything
um I think it said the number the the
first the first generation was like
three hundred something three their head
because it's a it's probably checked
end of the article maybe ah there we go
three four the original model launched
at 3:40 so the second one will probably
be a little bit higher yeah with the
upgrades expect a price hike for the
second day 400 450 or some like that 399
some people are saying in chat but I
think this is interesting I think this
is kind of interesting I can see a bunch
of pcmasterrace errs get into this
especially if it's a full Windows
environment that can be sort of modified
and tailored to your your own personal
preference and I mean since it's a full
piece it's a PC right runs Windows and
couldn't you have any emulator on it yes
any emulators see I was saying you could
also do some steam link or whatever
steam
oh yeah forget steam thing is so if you
had a right if you had a more powerful
gaming PC in your in your house and a
decent-enough Wi-Fi router then you
could you know stream the games get in
the game remotely from that and sure
play at a better frame rate that kind of
thing so that that's cool - yeah um
somebody's I don't know if people are
saying I don't know what the refresh
rate on the monitor the display is but
no justjust just refresh rate if I could
have to be 60 as long as it's 60 or
better right yeah doesn't say I would
hope at least I would expect the
basement at least line of 60 and yeah me
too that's yeah anyway anyway pretty
sweet yeah I'd like to check one of
those out but I'm moving on here our
last little article from ur for hot and
heavy hardware is from guru 3d calm
about Corsairs new a iOS they've left
the H 15 I Pro and the H 150 I Pro
that's a two hundred and eighty and
three hundred and sixty millimeter
radiator respectively aha and you'll
notice the pro indicates that well it's
not a hydro these are not part of the
same hydro coolers the hydro line that
were used to this is a new proline they
don't use water
that's that's not necessarily the games
professional water professional water
it's no longer hydro water or water
water it's like very professional water
that's like you know wearing a suit it's
probably some new substance that's more
wet than water and the and the added
wetness helps get you wet as you think
about how wet your CPU is and how cool
the H 150 I pro is keeping it that's and
that's a hashtag marketing right there
so you can use that in your marketing
your marketing you know stuff and make
sure that you have a little sticker that
that you know validates that it is RGB
wetness the wetness is all our GPA um so
this is featuring a new design cooling
block looks pretty nice I wonder if
there's something else here I believe
they showed this design yes yeah yeah I
recall me too it might have been
slightly modified for the final version
right I'm wondering if both did a
similar thing like they did with their
there you like their like their last
generation fans or in the head look like
the blue white or red rings that you
could swap out wondering if that's a
similar thing here with the the white
sort of I don't know I feel like that's
fallen out of style you know you just
get the RGB LEDs in there now and you
don't bother with the fixed sure I just
I'm surprised already said that they
went with white because some people like
black is just so safe and even white
like like white things don't sell in
this category quite as nearly as much as
like all black so I'm just I mean you
never know you never know I mean it's
still color neutral and stuff I never
know anything yeah you don't you dumb
stupid but let's see we've got a retail
price for the H 15 I pro of 139 dollars
or 140 USD and the H 150 I Pro would
cost 160 us availability is to be
determined but I think the
cool thing about these radiators these
arrows is that they're they're actually
coming they're shipping with the ML Mack
maglev fans is and that does those are
some solid fans those are really like
some of the best fans on the market and
of course they have RGB on the the
waterblock but whatever but yeah hello
fans I mean that's like those are what
20 30 bucks apiece at least so I could
see why it's it's a bit of a price hike
over there hydro Series for sure doesn't
say in the article if there's any change
to the actual like micro fins inside of
the the water block or anything like
that or the pump perhaps the tubing
looks like it's sort of the same kind of
black sleeved fabric effect there's only
so far that you can go with that you
know with radiator technology yeah you
know yeah but maybe the fins the fins
are more dense higher fin density or
titanium we're not sure if they're
titanium edged with rhinestones that's
that's the that's the trend in 2018 it's
super effective
but that concludes hot and heavy
hardware that was good that was a good
great I enjoyed that could you could you
and you know it's sad is that that kind
of float exactly like all the other
times I do that segment when I do
prepare I am prepared well which means I
buy suck whether or not I prepare which
means you should not everywhere anymore
right why have I been spending like
hours upon hours planning for the show
and I can just like pull it out of my
butt in like 15 minutes
I'm gonna do that from now on I've asked
myself that question you guys will never
know many times never know the
difference
moving on though to our next segment
which is pit knob pity see it is oh it
is yeah of course it is it is on I'm
ready for payment I see Donkey Kong our
first our first system is from a flow a
flow it's gonna be shown in just a
moment with 6700 K EVGA GTX 970 super
super clock
you've got a cooler master half half XM
case old-school keep it old-school I
like a Z 170 X ultra gaming motherboard
from gigabyte h100 IV - this picture of
Kyle's commute to my house yep
that was me I was very living
dangerously tweeting while driving let's
see what we got here let's take a look
at the side okay so it looks like you've
got sort of a black and red thing going
on here alright I got a red flag got her
got her a red flag right here I've got a
couple yeah you go first
it's sitting on the goddamn carpet a
flow oh are you doing you ain't get no a
flow I can't imagine the zero a flow
can't imagine that you took your
computer off of your desk and set it
down on the carpet in order to take this
picture which means it's sitting on the
carpet the whole like that's really
where you keep your computer
yeah and it's powered on look your power
supply that power supply has a fan at
the bottom of it just sucking up all the
grudge's in your carpet just just just
be choked yeah who are you weren't see
urine bang up the dirt Greg I complain
about people keeping their computers on
the floor
you're literally shortening the life of
your power supply by oh yeah by blocking
the hair flow to it yeah you freaking
out right I'm triggered yeah deal with
this triggered ancient anvil putting
that computers on the ground
damn yeah geez okay I hope it's not his
permanent place for this thing all right
so really hope none so if this was a
driving test to the theum be you would
have automatically failed but let's at
least go and look at the rest of your
system all right could use a dusting
Dustin yeah well you know what hey it's
probably from being on the carpet 24/7
if it is yeah cable management is kind
of sporadic be tightened up a little bit
and yeah no I think the knock to a fan
that you have there's a rear exhaust
that
it's probably doing a great job but it's
not doing you any favors in the cosmetic
department just because it's about if
you're gonna really upgrade the
aesthetics in internally vacuum the fan
and your five and a quarter inch optical
drive or was standing out mm-hmm
everything else blends in fairly well
aesthetically you just you kind of need
to take a second shot at your cable
management I feel like just tell you
things up you some twist ties bunch some
cables together get rid of get rid of
little things like the two pin that's
kind of just hanging loose off of your
your plug on your graphics card there
any of these cables that are just kind
of going right over the motherboard here
just see if you can route them up
against stuff yeah um
cinch him down yeah and then and I would
look much better and then take your
computer and put it on your desk and
treat it with respect like you would a
lady a lady or or you know something of
great value okay next up good job a flow
next thanks Brian
Barak subtract 78 he made this design he
made he designed this he's a genius and
he's talented
he says I'm probably too late but here's
my entry pin my PC you weren't too late
hi you're rung $470 after mail-in rebate
entry level gaming build r3 1200
overclocked to 3.8 gigahertz msi be 350
gaming pro m 8 gigs g.skill ripjaws 5 at
30 66 megahertz power color RX 5 64
gigabyte corsair CX 550 psu and he's got
an SSD in there as well he's gonna paint
it red he's an SSD red inside of a cm
cooler master master box light 3.1 this
reminds me very much of my black friday
build when a woman when I went on a $500
shopping spree actually spent a little
bit less than $500 so probably the same
price point here I got a slightly
different I got the same CPU as you rise
in 312 hundred great bang for the buck
if you're on a tight budget I think I've
got a different I get I definitely got a
different I think I went in video from
my GPU I did a gtx 1050 TI
slightly different case but this is a
pretty nice looking system honestly like
this is about it
as they come for a budget build I mean
and you don't really have the luxury of
tucking away and hiding every single
cable inside of a super super
entry-level yeah in case you got like
zero behind the motherboard room exactly
build say you did a really nice job here
I like how you sort of wedged all the
cables between the power supply and the
little SSD tray of the drive cage they
blend in because they're all black
there's no ketchup and must have a super
budget rig with all black cables as it
oh the newest of course there's CX
series updates they have all the animals
and no gain on the labels or anything
well yeah they're trying to catch up
with EVGA EVGA has been crushing it -
and then also it looks like yeah you've
just got plenty of open space at the
front of your case for for unimpeded
airflow cable management's on point I
don't really have much to complain about
here other than what Mouse is that isn't
it is that like an old mouse or is that
it's probably a modern mouse that I'm
just looking at it like it's really kind
of see see if the if the PC that you
submit for pip my PC is perfect and
there's nothing for me to complain about
I'll just complain about looking out the
other stuff in the picture yeah but yeah
that's really nice I also have zero
critiques yeah good job right the only
thing I would say would be the SSD which
he said he's already playing to paint
red yeah which will really really tie
the whole whole system together thanks
John Brancato next we got Cho let's see
his thermaltake view 31 is the case at
an asus strix
z2 7 the e motherboard with a 7600 K
it's a core i5 he's gonna Thermaltake
ring cooler 16 gigs of tread NZ ddr4 at
an EVGA gtx 1070 let's take a look first
thing will well two things that stand
out is the label on the power supply as
well as the red plugs on the
the power supply connectors for the
graphics card Wow what I like I I was
thinking of something else and I was
like for sure Paul is gonna say the
thing that I'm thinking oh no but you
said two completely different things
really it's interesting how you like
your eyes were drawn to something
completely different first glance I was
like oh he's got two things he's
definitely I was gonna say that the
waterblock oh the water blood I was just
sort of laying crooked that angle that
kind of drives me insane but it's still
perfectly functional that but it's but
due to the fact that it's three hundred
and sixty millimeter radiator and you
got to put the tubes at one side or the
other and we on this side are fairly
stretched out like there's not a whole
lot that can be done you might be able
to rotate it to where the water at 3.0
text is going vertically up and down but
I don't think you can get it to the
point where it was it would be straight
like I don't think he could put those
connecting tubes on the button it
doesn't look like there's enough slack
there what what if what if he flipped
the radio like would it be possible to
flip the whole radiation so it's already
eight had the tubes coming from this
side it could work but then you actually
might be dealing with the situation
where the tubes are too long and they're
dripping down and conflicting with the
graphics card there so I don't know find
those I don't know what I don't that's
an issue
I don't the solution is here but I know
that the top of this is really just a
flat black plastic surface with this
sort of screen printing on it with
Thermaltake so you could cover that or
paint over it or yeah you know get a
sticker or something I don't know
there's those other options for you
there yeah that at least would get rid
of the text being in it all akimbo and I
agree with you taking off that sticker
on the power supply yeah I didn't
realize that they made an RGB power
supply i agreen either it's just
basically I took one of their RGB fans
and stick it in there stuck a ring in
there which I guess then in that case
kind of makes sense to have the power
supply fan facing up because then you
can actually see that fan and appreciate
it to some degree I mean I usually go
with thin fan down and it's not it's a
matter of preference to some degree but
usually
that lets you take advantage of the dust
filter on the bottom of the case which I
believe the view 31 has I haven't worked
with this case so I'm not positive
beyond that it could use a little bit of
cable tidying up down in that in the
bottom area right behind the power
supply mm-hmm and I'm wondering if he
has like there's so many thermal I've
never seen so many thermal take things
inside of a system if there was a case
alert then we'll take power supply and
like six room fan maybe he works for
thermal taking do you work for thermal
take I don't know also it just like it
like you said it bothers me that they
have red connectors red plugs for the
PCIe cables yeah an RGB power supply
that's always irritated me like there
aren't many power suppliers out there
that are RGB so if you're gonna do it
make the frickin cables black you could
buy different caps in a pin extractor
and swap those if you really wanted to
but yeah that's up to you or you could
just get like extensions or something
like that I'd be another option but yeah
I mean overall again this this is not a
bad looking system I think we're just
giving it some critiques get my PC
alright we've got Andy build yet FX 8350
GTX 1050 TI super super clock from EVGA
one terabyte everything drives Corsair
LED fans zip-tied heatsink no mounts and
600 watt power supply eight gigs of
HyperX Ram cooler master master box
light five this is the same heatsink
wait mister box light five so the case
is actually one of the newer the case
and the graphics card okay this is our
somewhat newer Bryan Bryan Moroccan
spilled was in the the master box light
3.1 okay this is the five master box
like five which isn't that much
different from what I can tell maybe a
little bit more high-end so the cable
when you look at the cable management
wean Brian system not to call you out or
anything
Donavan but it's a good reference like
look at brian's bill and see how he's
done things to what can be done yeah
exactly he is working with the Paris
supply that has a bit cleaner look when
it comes to the cabling for sure how
much you can do about that but yeah
definitely there's a lot of work that
can be done with the cable management
here also this just seems like a
slightly interesting mix of components
but I think actually these of course are
LED fans are what standing out to me
these are twenty twenty twenty dollars
each like put that towards the actual
decent zip ties that's forty or fifty
dollars that you could spend on a yeah
like a CPU cooler that you could get rid
of those zip ties with I mean that's
just you
much respect if you're if you're in a
tight spot and you just need a heat sink
fan on your CPU you could have already
had those and managed to wire it in that
way yeah so you've been a gift you
didn't spend cash money on those Corsair
fans and that's fine but if you did that
that's kind of silly beyond that yeah I
mean you just you're dealing with some
some kind of older and outdated
components here you're really you're
really gonna want to consider upgrading
your your core platform here you FX 8350
there's so many good options when it
comes to engineering stuff with horizon
and lots of deals right now because
Verizon 2 is coming soon hella deal more
on that on my half of this year yeah
yeah so yeah that's kind of what I would
lean towards granted you're gonna need
to upgrade your memory too in that case
which might be expensive as well but
your case is good you got a couple of
fans set up
yeah I'm adding maybe hold out for that
court that that base platform upgrade
and then and then can I see what you can
do about reconfiguring some of the other
stuff and eventually you're gonna want
to either get extensions or a power
supply a different power supply and you
got a 600 watt EVGA so I'm sure it's
fine as far as functionality goes but if
you really want things to look clean you
probably wanna get get rid of those
ketchup and mustard cables indeed
completely agree with everything you
said next up we've got sue Christmas em
Chris our final
I singled Chris out I fixed Chris
because he had a very familiar-looking
system hmm inside of an end to elite the
same $900 case that I just had finished
my elite build inside of also an SLI set
up with a rampage six extreme
motherboard and mono block from ek water
blocks Wow
1080 T eyes at 1200 watt power supply
there so these are all similarities
between between both of our builds so I
just had to take a peek here he is using
the ring fans rather than okay he also
has six and he's got 608 what the front
he's combining he's got coarser and
thermal take up here looks like he's got
sort of a semi right-hander set up is is
it only this one picture no yeah oh okay
it's gonna be one of those shows ladies
and gentlemen this show you're in for
this hope you're ready for okay I've
heard this a really good video on how to
clean a mechanical keyboard by a polyp
hardway somewhere somebody that I was
years ago
yeah right at least a couple years yeah
that's video still I mean it still is as
is valid and relevant useful today of
course this wasn't the day it was
published pushing buttons I like I'm
gonna push some shortcut key unplug it
first
alright so what are we looking at here I
will say I am envious that you were able
to fit a do loop system in here have
those reservoirs where they are and
still managed to get those front
radiator fans inside of the radiator
brow cuz I was oh my goodness I know
oh that's the ball it's waking out man
everything's fine this could end the
stream pick it out you
immediately kill the stream I've got
other keyboards we can switch to if
necessary but that's my one that's
that's one of the sacrifices I had to
make when building the elite build was
putting those fans on the very direct
underbelly outside of the radiator
bracket in order to house both of those
pump Reds combos so what that equates to
is pretty choked airflow as a lot of you
guys already know if you have a fan
that's directly underneath the front
panel and it doesn't have in the actual
blades are not are not actually
positioned before and you start a
ventilation opening or mesh then you're
basically getting some choked airflow
and it's not to say that I'm like not
confident that the 79 80 XE that I have
in there is gonna be suffering or
anything like that
I think it'll be just fine but I think
there is a lot of cooling potential lost
because of how I've situated things but
having the fans where you have them here
I think that's gonna give you maybe
maybe a couple degrees cooler
temperatures on what looks to be your
GPUs because it looks like that's your
GPU it's interesting because the front
radiator that I have in that build is
actually servicing the CPU it's part of
the CPU loop so what else is interesting
here is that looks like you've got a 280
on the mid plate just below your your
GPUs I think mine's a 360 so you do have
a little bit more room for for routing
the writing the tubes and stuff like
that you've also put all of your fans on
the two bottom rads as in a pull
configuration bringing air from the
bottom of the case and and your bottom
radiator also has a push-pull
configuration oh it's so I'm actually
planning to do some testing where I I
test the thermals in its curve in the
system's current configuration and then
flip all of the fans
the bottom two radiators to see if that
changes because I'm very interested and
also to see what's happening someone
take a shit here oh stop farting you're
disgusting thank you you dog you hurry
is it time for its its it's gone it's a
goner
it's not God I just need to dry out it
needs a timeout yeah
good lord
what are you doing pushing just
validating keystrokes device is ready
sweet anyway it looks like a promising
build you have going on here some of
these two bends it looks like it looks
like you're using a couple elbows too to
get your runs along where you want them
well you've got some funky belts too
like the one going to your CPU outlet
and even your the inlet for your for
your model block they're pretty pretty
wacky sort of bends and also the one
coming out of the left reservoir is very
interesting
you were bolder than I am sir to say the
least but that is to say I hope
everything goes well for you and good
luck on this build I know looking at
this picture I know how much time and
thought went into even getting to where
you are now he's been he's been flailing
in chat asking us to click the image or
link aha for more pictures with it lit
up well there it is it's all say what do
you think now I liked it I I'm sort of
jealous that you have two different
fluids in your loops because that's what
I wanted to do and it I didn't get
around to it but I'm gonna be changing
out some things with the elite build
very soon like they're like like drastic
drastic changes very soon but it's nice
to see that you've got it up and running
doesn't look like they're any leak
issues or anything like that it's
interesting that his front fans are all
exhaust right I just noticed that just
dawned on me I think that's probably
done purely for looks potentially I mean
that's partially why my mid plate fans
like on them on the mid plate radiator
here that I had below the GPU that's
what partially why they're set to
exhaust pushing air downwards because I
want to see the the the beautiful RGB on
the other L Series fans but now I want
to do a comparison video where I
actually flip all the fans to see if
okay I'm super I have another makes it
different I have another brilliant
product idea for any any vendors out
there who are watching I'm just gonna
say it
Shark Tank it me giving money if you
make this thing make why don't they make
flippable fans where you can somehow
flip the bearing or something like that
to where you could make it an intake or
an exhaust but either way we wouldn't
have the you know the ugly cross part
with the hub connector I'm sure that
could be designed I'm sure it could and
that's a great idea or maybe even just
like a switch a switch on it to switch
the polarity so it just spins one way or
spins the other way so you can flip the
fan that probably really easy our fan
the fan blades aren't I mean you have to
be like a like a symmetrical reversal
yeah and the fan blades you're right
you're right the fan blades about to win
in such a way that you know what you'd
probably sounds like dude it's doable or
well I don't know I feel like I'd have
to think about it more but then maybe if
you could pop it off and flip the blades
but the hub stays the same right mmm
because designing a blade that would
work both ways wouldn't be quite as yeah
you lose some yeah I could you know that
fans where you can pull the whole fan
off to clean it what if just the blade
part came off and then he could flip
that and pop it back up and flip a
switch yeah you know man of course
someone someone who does that
if someone owes me money now and have
them actually work well that's gonna
make a lot of people here
including myself good ideas Paul good
ideas all around but thank you guys so
much for submitting your pictures of
your systems for Pitt my PC there will
be more opportunities next week
potentially yeah but we can move on to
our face off that David didn't face off
in a while
this might be challenging without the
full-size keyboard but we'll see or
twice as fun or twice as fun we are
playing and I think we played this game
before I was such in a rush as I
mentioned earlier that I just picked a
random game on this site that I usually
go to
which is super fighters but I think we
have played it before but that's okay
that we can have a rematch because I
think you might have beat me at this
game last time and now it's time for my
vengeance I hope so I will get to my
sweet sweet vengeance this is uh the
punishment is going to be loser has to
drink something some some drink a lot
drink after they drink yeah I'm not
gonna make us like pound the golden drop
because it's 10% and we'll both die yeah
but but there will be there will be no
punishment so yeah super for oh maybe we
haven't played this maybe we have I
don't know very very edgy action music
like spy versus spy yeah wait a minute
Oriole we can just jump right in we've
played this before let other people who
I know how that's working okay just set
up graphic quality we don't attack your
system too hard ball turn on medium I've
done life right let's player 1 and these
know this is gonna be cuz I got to use
the right side of the keyboard
oh that's ok player 2 you're gonna be
WASD oh ha 1 2 3 4
melee she's a main power ok
okay versus sure I'm gonna be a Yammer
door playing this now stop it
Oh gonna be Scott okay
Oh who do you want to be I guess I have
to choose let me be the Mac Mac Mac a5z
robots robots 1v1 me biatch game mode
window first two three first three first
two three sounds reasonable
okay magic number okay
you have two platforms but double
tapping down okay press spacebar oh okay
okay oh I just dropped in a pile of out
I win Wow okay man boy I am so good at
this game
thought I would give you a head start
because there was intentional all right
take a drink a beer there so welcome you
get you know spawned on the nice ledge
and I'm like right above is it a d-ring
gonna wait for the ad pile of acid what
I don't know I was what ad it didn't
play because I have you block origin all
right here we go again I don't like this
I don't like okay so what happens oh no
okay I mean I remember this game but
this level is definitely much different
than the last time I'm scared I don't I
don't very challenging level expert mode
know what that means
oh jeez oh jeez
ah thanks aliens damn it oh wait how are
you Amy don't worry about it I'm playing
the game you play this before and you
picked it no what what wait how come I
can't pick this gun up
molotovs pick up the damn gun pick it up
alright I'm coming for you oh jeez no no
I love it yes yes that's the job are you
serious are you serious oh my god my
dead lifeless body that's awesome
getting the hang of this now I can feel
it oh wait how do you okay oh jeez oh no
no alright thank you for me or I guess
two for you technically alright alright
Oh starting us off pretty close this
time yep oh my god I'm so scared I hope
this doesn't Oh No that was so lame I
never actually hit I don't even think we
like actually hit each other really not
really I was oh it's a hard-fought
battle that's it so who can not kill
themselves first yeah pretty much who
cannot kill themselves the most all
right all the time I died was when I
jumped into the lava as well I killed
you once
I threw the I threw the Molotov at you
and you burned up when I died and that's
why I was wrong yeah that's true
exhibit you killed me once skill and
you're playing to three
and killed me one butcher I know
suicide we're very good at games you're
right Chet we're so good I'm super salty
but I still have to carry out the
punishment which is to drink something
any more beer : Drac doesn't really make
sense for this because it's just it's a
waste because it's so delicious you want
to you want to savor the flavor no I'm
saying it's more beers gotta save it a
shame
you're saying you wanna pound sure I
don't know about a whole one you have to
drive later but but I will pound maybe
half of one is that that's probably the
lighter one why this one we have right
oh I'll do I'll do a Stella handle a
Stella we can we can skip my last
segment because we have quite a few
donations and we're already somehow we
filled up the time I don't know either
so I'm gonna start reading off donations
here pup Shepherd for the five bucks
remember when I gave Kyle a shirt in
awesome hardware 86 be at one hour 10
minutes and 38 seconds have a happy
holiday Kyle I think about that one all
the time I'm saying that that shirt it
was actually for Christmas for Christmas
and right now is that no a shirt he gave
me a shirt yeah I remember the shirt Oh
was it a Christmas was it Christmas I
remember when he did that
Merry Christmas I'm saying when he said
that shirt was it intended to be a
Christmas present for right now oh I see
we're just playing in the hats
potentially true either way thank you
very much appreciated sir Fred rent $10
why is it where the guys drive the tank
ever if everything goes well but when
wifeís offs drives she runs over a car
because wifey sauce is a volatile human
being that is unpredictable and is just
one of one of God's natural disasters
quite frankly so um that explains it
but everyone should go watch the tank
video if you haven't seen yet Jay and I
make an ass of ourselves trying to build
a PC on a tank is that up um it just
went up on youtube or a big it's pretty
silly but thank you very much Fred
appreciate the donation he's really
looking for attention today and there's
even like a ten pound sandbag little boy
feeling neglected today I've paid
attention to him he's got lots of text
it's probably wondering where where's
mommy
it keeps no way I didn't know I don't
you stay there and I'll frame it yes you
and you you you've nailed it down to
muscle memory you do it in your sleep um
but okay uh let's see yep yeah we
confirmed that wifey sauce is crazy so
we can move on thank you very much Fred
appreciate it glad there was no
ultimatum with this donation this time
around
Alexander pinkles for the two hundred
rupees or rubies hello from the snowy
Moscow why hello I'm without beer today
but I have tea PS I like your show teas
always good you know it doesn't really
no it's actually not good at all
compared to beer but that's fine
it sure is yeah yeah everyone's got a
full like like full Ultra HD image right
now all right thank God if you can't
drop suddenly I was wondering what was
going on and I looked over okay let's
back up now it's back up make sure
skincare hashtag skincare any lives
matter Fred rent once again no no no no
Alexander thank you very much for the
donation for the two hundred rubies
I'm sure that's like a million dollars
u.s. I really appreciate it sir and
cheese from Moscow or cheers to Moscow
from LA pup Shepard once again pop your
your animal you're an animal
you're a pup your puppy five dollars
it's my birthday I turned 27 today wags
wags oh happy bird lots of puppies to
play with we pop at the buddha man you
dumb man we should we shake we grab you
some tempeh you know just you and that
no one else no supervision no
authorities TV chat with the fried dough
do tell bitch I'm gonna do you know
angry angry Asian accents angry American
tourists brand-new Springfield
nine-millimeter with a thousand Ralph
finals are done yesterday going to
America all over the range afterward
have a beer well baby I appreciate that
I hope you have the best of luck with
your finals hope you get through my
right and that you a small my friend and
go into America after all the all over
over the range afterwards cool sweet I
hope you fire all 1000 rounds of your
9-millimeter ammunition for you know via
your Springfield and and and drink drink
drink and be merry while you're doing is
I agree thank you very much TV thank you
oh yeah we got the the background music
back sweet next up we've got green
plantain five dollars all caps what's
going on so I have to read it in my
thumb sweetie what's going on with ASUS
next to 99 boards
cannot find any so how Kyle and Paul got
one sell me your rampage six you know
the amount of work that I have to do now
to tie it would take to actually extract
the rampage six from the elite though it
would probably take me like a day so no
I'm not gonna do that but what you can't
find any you can't have mine no you
can't have mine either
and there are a few PC parts that I'm
willing to part with
I wouldn't expect this there let's want
to speed no X 299 words out there why I
don't know why that would be the case
hiccups natural carbonation uh I don't
know I looked up the rampage six formula
the other day actually or like yesterday
and it was sold out on a new egg but I
didn't realize that all Asus xx too many
nine boards are sold out everywhere huh
that's a weird yeah weird thing I
haven't been shopping for X too many
damn boards around for you but thank you
very much anyway for the green plantain
donation the ride janeck for the five
bucks you know what would be an awesome
Christmas present advanced OC rising
video on Verizon Merry Christmas Paul
and Kyle have a beer on me an
overclocking video on risin the advanced
overclocking video and rise o advanced
okay when I did my basic overclocking
the unrest and I said I was gonna do an
advanced overclocking video people I
feel like half the donations are just
now like Paul you you need to follow up
with that one video on promised us I
know where's that one where they CPC
Paul that one in the HTTP see does that
advanced overclocking video and resin
Paul I deserve it I deserve it but you
know I
I do things in my own time oh no I'm
supposed to check this actually found in
that okay Lilly kill the golden jock
first and then I can pour it into the
glass because it's it's like striking
out of a bottle sucks I'm like bottles
for bottlenecks or corks moving on thank
you very much right Nick Fred rent $5
once again you guys doing the straw poll
wifey sauce would also love to see it
let's trouble so what do you I think
about when you do these last week I
think so
he's expecting a week ago yeah yeah that
was like that was like way like that's
like 30 donated like a hundred dollars
he did but it was to you so it's your
responsibility you want to send me the
straw poll I will show it to the
audience
bread's that if you if that was the
donation was to me I until they remember
it but it was to Kyle sytem I shut up no
you would not you're totally lying right
now you're told no one would ever
remember that because when we both read
that whenever we read these donations
were already a few beers deep and
sometimes has 10% beer and no one can
expect us to remember any of this yeah
this is why we stream it and record it
live it's so we can have a record will
actually have back oh yeah I recall this
organically nonetheless Fred thank you
for your patronage and donations
I'm sure wifey sauce will pick up the
pieces as she usually does after me one
random person that's his name one random
person for the 50 Norwegian Crona what
mini ITX case do you recommend for a
portable VR rig I have to
I had the note 202 which is fantastic
you know you can sort of modify it a
little bit to fit a 120 ready radiator a
IO in there if you wanted to um but
there's there's so many good mini ITX
cases nowadays you know and like what
makes it a good VR portable rig I mean
it's really the hardware that you're
putting inside of it that makes it good
for VR but what are some I like mini ITX
I can't I can't remember the model
numbers of them but I like the little
shoebox cases little ones that are
you know oh yeah about that big I still
don't mind makes one coolermaster makes
one yeah I believe Corsair makes one
they're all kind of based in the same
internal frame has some options there
yeah that's g05 from Silver's those are
small enough that you can pick them up
and take them with you but they usually
still fit full-sized power supplies and
sometimes even a five and a quarter inch
band there so it means you don't
necessarily have to pay more money for
the shrunk down components yeah so
something like that would be a decent
option if you want to take it with you
and you got to fly anywhere and then
definitely something like an ode to a to
that size it's gonna be better for you
cuz you factor I don't want to be able
to put that into a carry-on carry-on
luggage so you can take it with you and
not trust it to the baggage handlers oh
yeah yeah hope that helps yeah Zac the
core barrier for the $10 moving our
physical media to digital system six to
eight hundred K at four point zero eight
32 gigs of DDR for 2,400 Intel 600p 850
Evo and WD hard drive takes forever and
handbrake am i doing something wrong
looking at a 960 Evo eventually um I
mean takes forever is a relative term
you're talking about transcoding video
which is sort of inherently a time
consuming thing it's gonna take more or
less time depending on the length of the
video and resolution your your
transcoding to and then that kind of
thing so it might just be that if you
haven't done that very much before
you're not just not used to how much
time it's taking beyond that I mean it
looks like you have a pretty good setup
for what you're doing and breaks fairly
multi-threaded isn't it or mark yeah
handbrake should should be multi for
multi-threaded right so I mean you're
sixteen hundred case still only has four
cores I mean granted scottex o 6800 K is
a six core oh yeah you're right you're
right you're a six seven okay Wow brain
fart
yes 6 cores 12 threads if you're
experiencing trouble and hand
you might want to look at your source
your source material sometimes if you're
dealing with like just like a super big
raw file say you're just like shooting
in RAW even something like that
sixty-eight hundred K can get bogged
down I'm winning coating that um apart
from that I don't think it's your SSD I
don't think a 960 Evo would help you're
already pretty capable 850 Evo so that's
what you're buying it that's why you're
buying it if that's why you're buying it
I I don't know um I'm not sure we need
more information
but 6800 K is it's pretty baller so I
don't think that's where you should be
looking if you're transmitting media
like get a you know cue up a bunch in
handbrake and like overnight it's
usually how you do it next up Stephen
Hill $50 holy smokes
you son of a bitch setting this off
before hitting the gym Merry Christmas
gentlemen Merry Christmas Eve and
Christmas hope you have an excellent
holiday fun-filled workout that I wish I
was
III could bring myself to do right now
but you know I'm a lazy piece of shit so
I feel like you look what you did
Stephen you made Kyle feel bad yep I am
sad panda I thank you very much though
man appreciate that
awesome domination Fred rant once again
what do you want now Fred $5 Kyle when
you do a video on connection and config
of the Corsair lighting note pro I
already kind of did a video on the
Corsair ll series fans including the
lighting note pro so yes so yes in a
past slash future tense but thank you
for the donation in the list Yoda
you're a ninja from 50 bucks you're a
ninja
holy smokes brother hey guys been a
while since I donated any chance you
should you guys might add nightbot to
twitch so that you can add useful links
via commands to your stores YouTube
channels etc also how come the
bottleneck shirt isn't
Blin so to answer your first question we
have a amazing bot named cell processing
who is better than any other bot that
you could possibly automatically
implement we firmly believe in human
human human body human body is a phrase
that exists that I did not just make up
and as far as your other question may be
it will become a bottle of tri-blend
shirt maybe the bit where Bubba lecture
it will become tri-blend I'll talk to
John our t-shirt guy and merchandise guy
about that because I have seen a couple
requests for that so um yeah I like the
tri-blend sorry our tribe blends are
super nice
oh yeah super nice yeah they're three
times better than single blends um
moving on to Scott dill make six dollars
and six cents a day watch show at the
moment but we'll catch it later Kyle the
10k bill turned out beautiful that fast
forward to bending montage was dope
Paul HTPC thanks Scott there will be
some changes to the elite build coming
soon stay tuned for it's gonna look
completely different in a couple weeks
oh oh what's he doing Oh his bed is in
proximity of the tripod that holds the
camera you're watching us through right
now yeah dude I kind of had an idea to
do like like the dual loops awesome
because you can put two different color
fluids in it and when they cross each
other it looks really badass so I was
thinking like doing the whole like like
yellow magenta and turquoise like that
trifecta I think that's a cool that's a
cool combo so maybe like one loop will
be magenta the other will be yellow and
then are all the RGB lighting would be
teal or turquoise I don't know I know
there's a random thought that I had but
I think pastels would look super badass
inside the elite build
that is to say like the great thing
about the elite build and the way I sort
of designed it and built it was that it
could be anything I wanted at any time
as long as I was happy with the runs
which I currently am I love the way the
runs look it suits my style and I just I
just like it personally it's really easy
to swap out the fluid anytime it's
really easy to change the RGB lighting
anytime so I can literally change the
overall look of that system like that
and without really much effort at all so
it was a little bit you know not 100%
satisfied with the current silver view
the view itself the view fluid itself is
beautiful when I look at arctic panther
back there and it's a white view Paul
actually got warm probably one of the
last bottles of white view that promote
show themselves you know right on hand
he stole it it's red for my arms right
for my hands that you know the silver
doesn't reflect the lighting and quite
as quite as nicely there's not as much
contrast it can look a little dull if
I'm speaking honestly I'd have my own
you know plus 12,000 build $12,000 build
but it's not over it's far from over
folks and I'm still gonna be making a
lot of iterations to it in the future so
stay tuned moving on though things
Robert just got me note are bison sorry
if I butchered that probably did $5 hi I
received an Asus tough B 350 M plus
motherboard for Christmas with with
horizon 1700 CPU wondering if there's
going to be any safe overclocking
overclocking is not inherently dangerous
nowadays your system will shut down if
it's too hot or can't handle it or it
just won't post letting you know like no
yeah we were starting to do that it's
not gonna try to like run all of your
favorite games and then like somehow
like sprain an ankle or like blow out a
knee in in mid application so I don't
know look up a bunch of guides you could
probably find someone
Paul's channel my channel J's channel
Lance's channel they're everywhere
but overclocking is not as scary and and
disastrous and dangerous
most people think it is or as it used to
be senior sheep sheep duck or sir sheep
Doug SR heaped-up $5
one of y'all should be doing a deleting
video with the increasing impact of crap
Intel Tim on CPU temps deleting is now a
thing keep up the good work
why do you think I had the one and only
Steve of gamers Nexus aka Tech Jesus
delayed my 780 XE d living video coming
up
you didn't pause deleting things himself
like like a big boy it's actually doing
it all on his own didn't have Steve do
my dirty work for me you know I've got
minions everywhere it's a whole network
of it with minions I have to find mighty
7rk that I'm not sure where when you do
that do but yes D lighting is great it's
great it increases power phase power
efficiency lowers thermals lowers
temperatures and can potentially improve
overclocking as well there are some
risks involved but as long as you know
you're doing like Paul or Steve you
should be totally fine I've never
attempted a deal it I'm sure I could do
it I'm sure it's it's learn a bull
enough for even someone like me to do it
with the property living tool and stuff
but yeah that was more of like a
time-based thing as like I don't have
the time to like learn and like get a
deal editing tool I didn't even have a
deal living tour or know where to find
one and I was like Steve lives for this
shit and he can probably make some
content around it which he did which
which also turned out like that's the
other thing I like about having Steve do
you like my 79 80 XE was that that was
my foot my foot like literally like just
like got caught on my mouse cable
escaped it was like but that's the
reason why I like Steve like the fact
that he deleted my CPUs cuz he made like
actual like really useful informative
data driven content based on my d lid
that a lot of people learned a lot from
including myself rows like if I were to
do it was like well it's it's like it's
like Jays two idiots series but it's
just like one idiot trying to do little
Stevie like I guess I got it guys so I
was like yeah yeah this this is for the
greater good
it all worked out beautifully and in
temperatures actual temps in that
dedicate
CPU loop inside the elite build are on
the horizon folks so stay tuned for that
moving on here dingo am i voting $5
what up dingo I need to get my
girlfriend the best RGB keyboard and I
need to order it ASAP which ones do you
recommend guessing it's for Christmas
you are a procrastinator sir um the best
RGB keyboard on the market I mean what
Corsair k95 platinum RGB that's like the
flagship yes like that's their best I
mean that's that's like the most
expensive one I know of you spill beer
on it there's probably more this works
words from the wise there's a lot of
good RGB keyboards out there I think
Corsairs RGB implementation like as far
as how the LEDs look is very good
believe it or not - sorrow Tesoro has
some amazing looking RGB lighting in
there their keyboards the only thing is
that they use kale switches so if your
girlfriend is really set on Cherry MX
cherry switches then you might want to
stray away from that but if he doesn't
know the difference or if she doesn't
mind the the feel of kill switches then
the Tesoro is definitely cheaper than
the Corsair equivalents I mean it looks
fantastic their lighting is really on
point apart from that you know I would
say you ever try out different keyboards
with different types of switches figure
out what types of switches you want and
then look at the different out different
options from different manufacturers who
make keyboards with that switch and then
choose one that you like whether you
want sort of a simple design like you
know cool master master keys very simple
you know it's just the frame and then
the keys and that's all you really got
there right versus something like you
know g.skill has some options right
sarah has options I mean there's tons of
there's so many keyboard options out
there Logitech razor razor is a big one
to look in to check out like Black Widow
and stuff like that there's Fritton Go
Go - fucking what's his name
random Frank P random Frank P does how
RGB mechanical keyboard comparison tool
is that are really good and and very
well tested it was a lot of its
objective but he does a great job check
him out if you're looking for some
guidance moving on the
thanks dingo with that Anastasios
Anastasio s-- contagious Alistar cska
Thais for the $20.00 happy holidays
thank you very much love your show
thank you keep it the great work we will
one of these days when I have a PC I can
be proud of
I'll send you guys a pic so that you can
pick at it get my PC fodder love it
thank you very much Anastasio spree she
ate a man or woman I'm not sure based on
your name Brian Webb $14 I bought a
mousepad from Paul and it sucks
no no that's always it sorry I bought
Messer from Paul but I only need one
mousepad and I like Paul's logo better
so here's the money I would have spent
you know what Brian you know what Brian
just know that your $14 that you just
donated went to me all right
something I don't care it isn't it won't
keep me up at night that you like Paul's
logo better than mine I'm not offended
at all it isn't the universal sign for
PC Builders everywhere everywhere to
rally around shut up stop stop promoting
it in the glorious way that makes a lot
of sense thank you very much Brian for
your donation I'm using that mousepad
right here stupid stupid no the big ones
better
Tom's Bram's mitts 50 Norwegian krone up
in Toms almost forgot to donate for this
pork for these poor youtubers it's truly
Airport it's Tom thanks Tom for
reminding us thanks I like when you
remind us in your donation when you're
giving us money how poor we are and how
badly we need your sorry I literally hit
one cue and it opened up a Google Chrome
support Google tab weird anyway maybe
Chris was heavy year by the way Kyle I
vote for option number four
hashtag friend versus Kyle I don't want
to know what number four is I'll
probably find out later on tonight
courtesy flush and 35 beautiful name
love it
$5.00 watched pretty much every one of
Kyle's rise and build videos before I
built my most recent PC I call it ivan
ooze
thank you for the guides Kyle you are
very welcome Haven Newman's Ivan ooze
Power Rangers reference I wouldn't know
I've been hurt for some reason that
reminds me of Power Rangers no I'm
totally wrong
Ranger wiki oh my god I'm such a nerd
I'm such a nineties kid he's a Power
Rangers reference
he was the tyrant too is trying to you
know take over the world in this guy is
all purple is all purple it's purple
fuckwad he's a dick all right cool well
thank you very much I appreciate it I'm
glad that you were able to build an AI
system based on watching some of my
videos
that means means a lot actually bits be
tripping 20 bucks
let us know if you guys want the Titan V
or retaining yeah Titan be gamers Nexus
is finished with it would like your
viewpoint slash testing with it choose
and Happy Holidays
thank you very much bitsy tripping I
appreciate all the work that you're
doing for us tech tubers who you know
don't have access to a Titan V believe
or not even when we're you know as big
as we are we still don't always get
every single GPU that every GP
manufacturer ever puts out but I
appreciate the offer
we will definitely help them I'm sure
either of us will let you know if that's
something that we could use and I know
gamers Nexus his already has already
held it and created lots of nice cool
intensive testing yes they have so I
mean like what what what more could we
and Paul me and Paul offer on the Titan
V front that gamers Nexus hasn't already
fulfilled that is that is the real
question but we appreciate the donation
and the offer and Louis thank you very
much bits salmon dosa $5 the straw poll
was about you shaving your head Kyle do
it given also I love the show upgrading
my system with r3 1200 and SSD cheers
Cheers Sam great upgrade I approve the
straw poll was about shaving my head and
I do not approve of that because I will
never shave my head I don't understand
I'll let nature shave my head you know
when it decides that I should just go
fully yeah I mean probably yeah looking
at my like family tree I'm like I'm
definitely going called dragon bulb
anyway thanks Sam reminded me of my
impending doom and my scalps
hopelessness
zigfried 10 Canadians
currently using an r7 1700 w GT X 1080
and I'm thinking of switching back to an
Intel 6 Core i7 is it worth the switch
rising issues with RAM and system not
booting every time and I can't get a
good overclock you should be able to get
at least 3.9 gigahertz on all course
with that CPU I don't know what
motherboard you have that maybe that has
something to do with it hopefully it's
not an ad 350 I play more on the RAM the
rant resin could be very finicky with
RAM if you had out of a kit that's
validated to work on your motherboard at
overclocked speed then you might not be
able to boot you also have to configure
it properly in the BIOS in order for it
to hit the right the rated speeds
sometimes so that means you'll have to
within the BIOS or UEFI you have to dial
in the actual speed the timings and the
voltage of whatever ddr4 you're using so
look up some some guides on that that
that could help you out if you're not
able to hit the rated speed that of the
kit you bought but good luck
thank you very much Siegfried Dave Nunez
five Canadians I just picked up an asus
rog swift PG 2 7 9 q 165 Hertz
for gaming and an asus pro art ps2 7 9 q
for work does the gaming monitor have to
be primary no yeah I don't think so
either monitor can be primary
you could tell you you could tell
Windows to prioritize your your program
monitor for forgetting sorry they know
should be an issue
Fred brand cry wants the game on the
swift though yeah of course the Fred
ranch $5.00 was referring to the elite
build with several Corsair commander
pros I only have one commander pro in
the elite belt
that's enough to get all the six fans
that are actually visible those can be
plugged in the other six that are on the
other two radiators are plugged into the
that one of the fan hubs behind the
motherboard tray that comes included
with the empty Willie case there's only
one lighting node Pro that I have
installed that is synced to the six fans
that are visible inside of the main
cabin which is the top radiator and the
mid plate radiator and the basically
meaning that the other all the other l
series fans half of the l series fans in
the system are not lit up they're just
there spinning but they're not lit up
okay because there's only one letting
note pro in there as far as I know
there's no connectivity to to light the
rest of the fans up there um let's see
what we got hope sinker five dollars hey
guys any chance of an audio version of
the podcast for us to listen to in the
car at work would love to see this we I
don't know like it's just like one of
those things where it's like we don't
we're not even partnered we're not even
partnered like it'd be so easy for us to
just like apply for a partnership on
Twitch and have a lot more features for
us and even for you guys but we're just
like we keep it so casual man and you
know two key to actually make an audio
version I know it doesn't sound like a
lot but it it does it does require a bit
more man-hours on our end which I don't
see us doing really I think the best
thing I would say is if you have youtube
bread for instance you can actually
watch YouTube videos
while your phones locked or you can at
least hear the audio while your phones
locked
or you know the screens off so that
you're you know pretty much listening to
a podcast if you will but apart from
that III mean I'm I'm just leveling
leveling with you here I'm being
realistic or we haven't even made taken
the steps to become twitch partners
which would directly benefit us like
financially like we could make more
money if people could actually follow us
for like four or five bucks a month if
we were partnered we haven't even done
that so the fact that you're asking for
like us to make an audio version you
know is just it's it's we're too lazy
we're just too fucking lazy to do
anything we've the same lower thirds for
like a decade it seems but I it's always
nice to hear that you guys have interest
in that sort of thing that Paul and I
will never ever follow through with
moving Oh see okay okay okay okay
Fred ranch $5 no comment it seems unless
I of oh you had millions Kyle then you
got married I had millions of what I've
never had millions of anything other
than the camera just like twice in one
night like it's never happened and then
also twice in one night he likes the bed
over there he knows that we're paying
more attention to the tripod than him
he's clearly jelly super salty about the
tripod yeah I had millions Kyle then I
got married yet but wifey sauce sucks up
every every dollar I've ever made she's
just real Real Housewives of YouTube so
she is wishbone five dollars I've had
success on my liquid metal piece for pro
thermal paste swap using thermal
Grizzly's and made amazing stuff I
dropped 15 to 20 degrees and void
warranty
nothing wrong with that congratulations
on your temperature
that sounds strip wishbone Eric Q we got
two more here
sorry guys five dollars sorry guys
feeling pretty sick and we'll have to
turn in before the second half have
another five dollars thank you very much
Eric
hopefully you get better soon being sick
definitely sucks
I've been sick many times in my life
it's never been fun
Joey Goldberg $5.00 use this five
dollars to buy a Titan V should be
enough I'll buy two with that kind of
divination thank you very much
Joey and that is all I have for my half
of the show as far as donations I can
quickly rattle off some Johnson
shoutouts for anyone who happened to
pick up a piece of merchandise from my
star so let's see what's under this show
start like five ish okay all right we've
got one from Robert
dougies oh that's Robert Davis CPU
cooler and BIOS flash sure ceramic mugs
thank you very much for that sir I
appreciate I said we've got Brandon
doorbell for a CPU cooler and flash bios
more mugs more mugs monkey doing well
okay cool and then Brian Dixon Johnson
to you for picking up a bit bit with
words in a circle paint less double
chance of Brand X and so just brown
Robert Johnson Robert Johnson gets a
Johnson have her John Johnson for Robert
Johnson finger BIOS flash your shirt
thank you sir
we have one for Brian sparkles oh no
sparks I thought your last name was
sparkles I was in bill I was going to
freak out
bit wait circle logo decal cpu cooler
and flash bios ceramic mugs and an
awesome hardware and Star Wars and RGB
everything mugs
Robert Robert Johnson gets a double
Johnson Robert Johnson Johnson Josh it
should be a quadruple Johnson you
probably realize founder of that company
Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson that makes the baby
oil yes we've come full circle
James McMaster Johnson - you got the
double disc mat set as well as the beer
set desk mat John Reed awesome hardware
a swordfight gaming mouse pad and a CPU
cooler and flash bios color ceramic did
you say brand sparks sure - Wow
substantial order oh my god this is
unprecedented Justin Johnson Justin
Johnson Wow - Johnson's both getting
probably another double Johnson for the
double doubles Dillon for the dough but
that's another quadruple drop oh my god
double Johnson squared for Johnson we've
ever experienced swordfight shirt
tri-blend I've got awesome hardware Star
Wars Heather Navy and the Star Wars RGB
- everything's black ceramic mug holy
crap guys my god and finally Marcus
Edwards
Maka's ad was for the big wood gaining
desk Matt thank you very much for
picking up that mousepad you are going
to love it
I'm using mine everyday Louis and you
should too guys that's gonna do it for
my half of the show as unprepared as it
was seemed to be fun and there's a good
turnout thank you guys for being a part
of it but don't go anywhere because we
still have part two on Paul's channel to
go and it's gonna be awesome it's gonna
be incredible so go ahead and follow the
link in my video description if you're
watching a YouTube or just stay right
where you are on Twitter on TV we'll be
right back
