to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info alright
so obviously I had to stop by the razer
booth at CES this year just to see what
kind of crazy concept project they had
this time and of course they did not
disappoint with their new project Linda
this is pretty interesting and I'm
really curious to hear you guys as
thoughts on this one so be sure to blow
up that comment section when you get a
chance basically what we're doing here
is we're integrating their razor phone
with a custom laptop dock and it's
essentially supposed to bring your
mobile experience into the form of a
laptop
I mean basically the laptop itself is
more of a dummy computer it doesn't
really have much in it other than a
battery it's using the phone's
processing power for pretty much
anything which means the laptop does not
work without the phone but that also
means that it doesn't need any
ventilation or fan so it remains
completely silent doesn't even need
speakers because it just uses the razor
phone speakers which as we all know from
all the reviews are really freaking good
so that's kind of cool it's very light
very silent and it does contain a
battery however the laptop docks so you
could charge your phone while it's
docked that's kind of cool I don't know
exactly what the milliamp hours are they
weren't really clear on that or they
haven't really decided or settled on a
battery solution but it's likely that
the battery will be user serviceable
which is a huge plus there's also a
built-in antenna booster just to keep
the service disruption to a minimum and
improve signal overall after all you are
putting a phone inside of a giant hunk
of metal the laptop dock essentially
uses the same chassis as the razor blade
stealth although it's a little bit
thicker on this portion here just to
keep flush with the phone the dock
itself is using USB 3 I'm time husb
through a USB type-c which is of course
the same port as the phone itself you
get a full sized RGB keyboard with nice
chiclet style keys and they've actually
replaced the F bar at the top with with
a bunch of Android functions that users
of the platform will likely find handy
as well that's pretty cool now as you
might safely assume the phone can be
used as a trackpad to help navigate
around the Android UI it can also be
used as a secondary screen this is sort
of the direction the vision that they
have with this product is that you can
be gaming on your main display but have
like your menu
or your item menu your items menu on the
phone or let's say you're working with
Photoshop and you have all your tools on
that 5.7 inch display so that's actually
pretty cool I like that idea a lot I
just hope that you know while you're
typing and stuff you don't accidentally
press any of those things on the phone
hopefully there's like sort of a quick
you know disable the touch screen on
your phone type of thing so that sort of
thing doesn't happen the display itself
is thirteen point three inches it's got
a quad HD touchscreen and it is 120
Hertz to match the phone so you get a
seamless experience regardless of which
one you're looking at so that's actually
really nice overall I'm pretty excited
to see this come to the market and I
think it's I think the big challenge
here is what happens when users want to
upgrade their phone to something that's
not from Razer or maybe you know the
second-generation Razer phone won't be
exactly the same in size and dimensions
and shape and stuff like that so I'm
seeing some issues here just at the
beginning but I think the concept the
idea is pretty cool you guys let me know
what you think in the comments below as
always toss me a like on the video if
you enjoyed it and be sure to get
subscribed if you haven't already so you
don't miss any more of my coverage here
at CES 2018 thanks again guys I'll see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
