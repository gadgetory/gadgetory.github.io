Computex 2016 has been overclocked by
gigabyte fantex cable mod ng scale
making the contents of this video highly
unstable click the links in the
description for more info all right guys
I'm now kicking it here at the G skill
booth they've got a ton of stuff to show
off there's a bunch of overclocking
demos going on at the front beautiful
women all around but right now I'm my
main focus is the peripherals right now
we're checking out their new km 770 RGB
which is kind of very similar to their
earlier released km 780 RGB which you
guys are probably a little bit familiar
with now they've made some revisions to
that keyboard to make the 770 which I
actually think you guys are going to
like so first off with the the 780 you
had these these these side plastic
pieces here for a very gamer II
aggressive aesthetic and if you're not a
fan of that the 770 has actually done
away with those sides entirely so you
can see it's just a really straight edge
makes it a lot more simplistic and
minimalistic and also just kind of
shortens the the overall footprint of
your entire keyboard which I really
really like also the actual wrist rest
has gotten a little bit flatter just to
be a little bit more ergonomic I did
test it out briefly and it is super
comfortable and also this is probably
the biggest step up and when in my book
is they actually introduced RGB LEDs at
the very top row of buttons all the keys
on the top are completely customizable
now whereas before they were locked into
being read-only so that was kind of a
disappointment so you're actually
getting pull across the board RGB with
the exception of the volume adjustment
right here the but the volume LEDs are
still going to be red however they're in
talks right now
with a way to possibly disable that
within the software which I think would
be a good move just so you don't have
any clashing color schemes
this is bkm 570 MX and it's kind of a
more basic mechanical gaming keyboard
but it still packs in a lot of features
so it does have a pretty much red LED
LED backlighting on all the keys you can
actually do macros as well it's got a
very nice braided cable that is fixed to
the actual unit and it's going to be
coming in at a very aggressive price
point of just 99.99 99 so 100 bucks for
a mechanical gaming keyboard is pretty
solid very competitively priced and
we're going to be expecting this around
q3 or q4 so if you don't need all the
fancy features like you know USB your
audio pass-through things like that
you're just looking for a really good
gaming keyboard with cherry MX
mechanical switches that are going to be
offered in red blue or brown I believe
then look no further than this
particular keyboard from g.skill alright
now let's go to the power supplies
alright so g.skill is also showing up
there
new line of PS power supplies these are
the Ripjaws PS line of units we've
actually got two different flavors here
so you've got a gold version 80 plus
gold and 80 plus black platinum so for
the gold you're going to be getting
capacities wattage capacities that is of
750 or 850 watts whereas with the
Platinum you're getting 850 1200 or 12
hundred and 50 watts you can see right
here we've got - we've got the the 1250
and the 1200 the stickers look a little
bit different because we're dealing with
different OEMs here but essentially
you're getting the same pretty much
built in quality but that comes with the
Ripjaws line now I really do like the
new stickers on these particular sets of
units because they're completely color
neutral you can see it's also got fully
modular design regardless of whether
you're getting the 1200 version 850 watt
750 watt helps your system just stay
really nice and tidy overall they should
be hitting the market very very soon
stay tuned for q3 about and these things
these things will be dropping right
about then we have a little bit more to
talk about which I believe is memory key
skills known for they're very fast
memory so let's go ahead and check that
out now and in this corner we find the
Trident z series of memory from g.skill
you guys are probably familiar with this
line
very sexy Ram probably the sexiest heat
spreaders that I've seen in a long time
and they've actually got different color
configurations this time around so you
can see here we're looking at some black
brushed aluminum with some orange
accents and if you actually look at the
front plates of each of these little
test beds that that g.skill has set up
here you can see that there's just a
there's plenty of different memory
configurations to choose from in terms
of kit sizes capacity speeds cast light
and seeing things like that so here
we're rocking a 64 gig kit of ddr4 these
are 16 gig dims and there there are four
of them here 1.35 bolts and this is
running at 3200 mega Hertz with a casa
latency of 13 so you're getting really
good speeds low latency is always good
for for any kind of gaming moving down
the line here we've got a 16 gig kits
these are 8 gig sticks and there are two
of them there they're on a mini ITX
board now this is running at 41 33
megahertz with a cast latency of 1921
21:41 why this is interesting is because
up until this point 40 133 megahertz has
only been allowed or has only been seen
on 8 gig dims so now we're actually
seeing 16 gigabyte modules being able to
push this speed which is pretty
impressive
so here
pretty much a familiar color scheme this
is what we saw at the last generation of
tried NZ however we are rocking 16 gigs
here that's 8 8 gig sticks and there's 2
of them they're running at 4200 and 66
megahertz just blazingly fast for ddr4
and yeah these these things are fast I'm
just going to keep saying how fast these
Rams are these Rams that reams ráma
rám so here we have yet another 16
gigabyte kits 8x2
running at 4500 megahertz I've been
informed by g-scale that this is the
fastest kit that is on the Computex show
floor here at the event in 2016 which is
pretty impressive and if you actually
look at the modules themselves you can
see that we're rocking kind of a black
and yellow color scheme the yellow is
very nice and bright vibrant has a
really rich color to it not sure if it's
just the lighting at this booth but very
nice to see that the G scale is playing
around with the different color schemes
for this tried NZ series of RAM now here
we've got a 64 gigabyte kit these are 16
gig modules running at 34 66 megahertz
we've got a cast latency of 14 so very
fast Ram all around this is kind of
interesting we've got a school trail
look here little mini PC all set up
rocking some ISO dims and these these
DIMMs are actually overclocked to 33 33
megahertz at one point three five volts
we've got 32 gigs of DDR 4 in this
little PC here with a cast latency of 16
here we've got a 128 gigabyte kit these
are 16 gig modules there's 8 of them
Holy Mother of God
30 300 megahertz 1.3 5 volts once again
cache latency of 16 and these are the
sexy black and yellow dims this is a
rocking on an X 99 test bed with a 68 50
K we've got another 128 gigabyte kit
this one's at 3200 megahertz
ddr4 of course 16 gigabyte modules
things would be kind of a dark grey and
red color scheme cast latency of 14 how
about them apples
how about them memories after seeing all
those 128 gigabyte kits who even cares
about a measly 64 gig kits no actually
this is still pretty cool use your a
cake modules there's eight of them on an
X and test bed once again 3600 megahertz
ddr4 cast latency of 16 sorry
15 I swear I can read another 64
gigabyte kits 8x8 36 hundred megahertz
of ddr4 1.35 bolts cast latency of 15 on
a 69 50 X testbed rockin that X 99 love
on an Asus Rampage 5 Edition and
motherboard circling back to the 128
gigabyte kits here 16 gig modules again
8 of them fully packed they do an X 9
test bed rocking in a 6800 K this is
running at 34 66 megahertz again ddr4 at
one point 3 5 volts and a cast latency
of 16 and our final kit of the day here
at the G scale booth is rocking on an
msi x99s and other board with a core i7
69 50 X and this is a 128 gigabyte kit
16 gig modules fully stacked 300 sorry
3466 megahertz running at one point 3 5
volts ddr4 cast latency of 16 so sorry
guys I know that was a little bit
exhaustive there were a lot of kids to
go over here but I just wanted to show
you the range of options that the
g.skill has here with their try benzene
memory pretty much for any kind of
configuration or any capacity or speed
that you might need g-scale has you
covered
alright guys over here we've got some
gaming mice from g.skill actually it's
just one particular model it's the MX
780 this is not yet released we have no
idea when it's going to come to market
we've got a couple varieties here we've
got four different color schemes to
choose from and g.skill is only going to
be bringing two of these to market so
right now what you can do if you want to
vote on which color scheme you like best
you can head over to G skills Facebook
page cast your vote and two of these bad
boys will be being brought to market
sometime in the future we've got a
couple different varieties here so the
first flavor is kind of a black and red
you've got a rubberized black on the
outside with rubber with a sorry red
accents on the inside you've also got
three white models so we've got a white
and black with a white on the outside
kind of more of a glossy finish and
black on the inside and you've got white
and blue
and white and teal so bear Amman you
guys get to choose two of these which
ones do you like best regardless of
which two are brought to market they
will all feature RGB LEDs that are going
to be configurable in g-scale software
which is pretty cool all right guys so
we're now on the other side of the G
scale booth here and as you can see
behind me they've got a lot of cool
overclocking activities going on they're
doing like a show every half an hour or
an hour or so we actually have kingpin
world-famous overclocker so King Finn
has a pretty epic setup right here he's
rockin the 69 50 X from core i7 or from
Intel Core i7 the new 10 core chip also
an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 and he's also
rockin of course some G scale memory the
Tri Denton see very fast stuff but on
top of that he's actually overclocking
the hell out of his CPU and GPU using a
pretty cool method of distributing ln2
so he's actually got his own contraption
going on where he's got a cold pot on
top of his CPU and video card and he's
got these tubes running from a giant ln2
tank straight into those pots and he's
connected that to a little arcade
cabinet system it's like a Mortal Kombat
arcade thing and every time he presses
like the punch or kick button it
actually opens up a power control valve
and allow some ln2 to spill into the
cold pot now what that does is
essentially makes overclocking with ln2
a lot simpler because you're just hittin
the button instead of having to refill
the pot every few seconds and it's also
going to save you up to 30 percent more
ln2 in the long run lm-2 can actually
get pretty expensive depending on where
you get it from Taiwan it's dirt cheap
America not so much in the UK apparently
according to kingpin it cost an arm and
a leg so we're gonna have to find some
underground black-market ln2 dealer's
pretty soon but that is pretty awesome
also on top of that apart from just him
doing it himself his own contraption
he's trying to market this and bring it
to a global audience potentially so that
you could actually start overclocking
with ln2
at your own home now it's kind of
difficult - oh God focus when you have
me ah catch me
Logan everyone what are we working here
what we're doing I think I think Kane's
indoor glasses is rubbing off on you
what
did she just kick it screw her correctly
she was on the ground I hate people that
video clip went from 60 to zero in no
time flat anyway what I was trying to
say before Logan's so rudely interrupted
me was that King kingpin is actually
thinking about bringing this lnto
contraption he's made to a market so if
you are interested in potentially Ellen
to overclocking at your home you might
be able to buy a more polished version
granted this is just something that he
threw together in his garage but maybe
in the future you're going to be able to
see this in a retail store or on an in
an online store for example we have no
idea pricing or availability or anything
like that but Kingston is hard at work
trying to make this more accessible for
those of you who want to overclock with
ln2 at home and by the way let me know
in the comments if something like this
was brought to market it was relatively
affordable
would you consider overclocking on ln2
let me know in the comments special
