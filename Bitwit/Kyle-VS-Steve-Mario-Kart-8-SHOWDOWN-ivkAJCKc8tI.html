Mario Kart 8 and Steve and I have some
business to settle unfinished business
unfinished business all those other
people get in the way this time it's
just gonna be Kyle and me oh yeah the
stakes are pretty high actually whoever
wins this little Grand Prix will will
have to do some ridiculous stuff for one
they're gonna have to change their
Twitter handle to whatever the winner
tells them to and they will also be
their personal twitter slave for an
entire week which means the winner gets
to tell the loser what to tweet at least
once a day can tell them to tweet
anything they want mom I'm glad my mom
doesn't follow me on Twitter anymore you
just reminded me your mom's Twitter I'm
gonna have you tweeting your mom think
this is amazing it's not gonna matter
anyway Steve because guess who's losing
yeah wait what's going on I don't know I
think what is there a third player I
think I think this is really weird it's
like there's a third person here but I
don't understand why who's doing that
get-get get out of the third it's just
you and me in this room so I don't know
why there's a third guy I'll get it

give you you know I want to give you
some some kind of a chance oh and by the
way I've switched up I'm not using the
gamepad I'm going you're not cheating

high as they are I don't want to so in
