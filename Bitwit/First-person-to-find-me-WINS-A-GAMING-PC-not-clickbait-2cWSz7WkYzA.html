info alright y'all so the holiday season
has me feeling a bit more generous than
usual so I'm gonna do something kind of
special for all my fans and subscribers
who live in the local area near me in
Los Angeles in Orange County I have
brought with me my Kasasa Nyjah who
refuses to be on camera because she just
woke up we brought with us a gaming PC
with a core i5 8400 quad-core CPU and a
gtx 1070 TI from ZOTAC so right now
we're actually rolling around in one of
the cities near us and we're gonna go to
a secret drop-off location and tweet a
picture of that location and the first
person to recognize exactly where we are
get their asses down here and touch the
computer we'll be taking it home for
theirs to keep there's really not much
else to this video guys I'm sorry but I
thought it would be a cool way to sort
of give back to some of you guys who
live in my area if you guys remember I'm
also giving away a gaming PC or maybe I
already gave it away on the charity
stream on December 10th that I did with
Paul so that was for anyone who wasn't
local in the area so everyone kind of
gets something right I think we're here
now at the drop-off spot so let's set up
so just for confirmation here's the PC
on the table and right next to it is a
fountain with our iconic photo up so
here it is here's the tweet race starts
now
alright here goes nothing no takes you
back sees it's out there it's out there
I guess now we wait I suppose that's how
this works
dude oh my god come on hurry touch it
dude touch it come on her my god dude
that was like six minutes that was
literally like six minutes no I live in
Brea I look like Dominus are you kidding
me yeah I saw your tweet and I'm like oh
my gosh I know oh my god that's awesome
believe that did you see me my teaser
tweets from earlier or yeah okay I
follow your YouTube channel and I saw
your post yesterday
why of course and I was like okay like
so I went on Twitter and I was like yeah
watching that and then I saw I saw your
post this morning and I'm like you know
where he's at
I was like I know that Chase Bank so
when you saw the tweet drop of the
actual location did you just immediately
drop everything you were doing and just
haul ass over here I be honest did you
speed it off we won't say anything we
will turn you in did you not have any
work or school today where you just like
sitting around like Wes I'm a graduate
student okay Houston okay nice I don't
have class this morning I have class
this afternoon so it was the one day
that I was like I'm off in the morning
we were we were actually speculating
that the winner might be a college
student who didn't have class hours at
this time so was anyone home with you or
your dorm or anything it was just you it
like took off this morning I was on my
computer watching videos and with the
Twitter feed just like refresh that's
awesome dude well hey dude this is this
is your system core i5 gtx 1070 TI and
it is it is now yours so you get to you
get to walk home with this thing today
oh my gosh thank you so much man this
so sick I just want to give you a quick
look at the system before you take it
home just so you have an idea of what
you're working with
thank you guys remember man vs. build
where Jay and I did speed builds inside
of a Lamborghini and a Ferrari the
system is actually comprised of closely
reports that were featured in that video
so I did have to make a couple minor
upgrades because at some point during
the build we messed something up it was
probably me so I actually had to swap
out the motherboard and now it's the
asus rog strix be 360 i gaming which is
fantastic boards got em to support USB
3.1 gen2 and it does have built-in Wi-Fi
which is also pretty nice for a mini ITX
board we've also got 16 gigs of HyperX
fury ddr4 cooling our core i5 8400 is a
c7 from cryo Rick it's a nice little low
profile cooler does the job or not
overclocking here so should be plenty of
cooling capacity for our needs we also
have a 750 watt I think it's an
integrity fractal and of course the
lovely ZOTAC gtx 1070 TI mini which just
goes co so perfectly inside this case
and here's a quick look at our 240 days
we have a second placer sir you've
arrived just just short but but
commendable effort you're secondly has
to be grieve as well also reminds me I
should probably tweet that great so
firstly will stop coming
so that's your rig man what do you think
pop it over here I'll screw it in and
sew yours awesome thanks again all right
then we did have a runner up to your
name sir Nathan nice to meet you sir you
actually came in a couple minutes right
after but you are well that was a ton of
fun
I cannot believe just how quickly
Matthew got over here and even Nathan
Nathan was only a couple minutes after
but this was a ton of fun so I'll
probably be doing it again in a
different area most likely so that gives
other people in various other parts of
town a chance to win something cool but
thank you guys so much for tuning in
toss a like on this video if you enjoyed
it and get subscribed for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon you just
might win a gaming page say how we going
