built a gaming desktop but it's kind of
out of date and it's definitely not
gonna hold up for Battlefield 5 so let's
build a new one okay how do I get the
Steve Urkel to build a computer does not
age a tower must be an Asian Chinese
secret speed up your rig with the
toshiba OC ZTR 200 SSD experience ultra
fast performance packaged in a slim
two-and-a-half inch form factor using 64
layer 3d NAND flash memory now available
in 240 480 and 960 gig capacities click
on the link below for more info okay I
know I'm not the best PC builder you
know but Kai or teach me many things and
I've come a long way so today I take a
look at this video from the verge how we
build $2,000 gaming PC and I watched
video and give my two cents right J so
here we go let's see what they have
installed you can build a gaming desktop
for around $1,000 but I want to go all
out
so I spent around 2000 PC like this is
gonna be able to play me spend the two
thousand no he spent the two thousand on
the first credit card he don't have two
thousand not even Ruby Tom what do you
need to build the desktop well of course
first you need a table preferably not a
PC I thought you could build it in
mid-air go build in the sky maybe on the
crowd if it's gonna be metal have an
anti-static working surface layered on
top of it a thermal paste applicator an
allen wrench some tweezers to tight up
the wires a Swiss wait did he just call
those tweezers did he just call those
tweezers
that's a zip tie how how in God's name
is my English better than his what the
tweezer that's for the eyebrow with the
pp a Swiss Army knife which hopefully
has a Phillips head screwdriver in it
and a Swiss Army knife
that hopefully you hope it has
screwdriver what's he saying oh you need
to build a PC it's an Aaron wrench in
the hope No
stupid some stupid idea get the real
screwdriver you should ditch Aaron and
get with fira and last but not least an
anti-static bracelet which is to protect
you and the parts these are the parts
you're gonna need but more hold on hold
on
he doesn't even connect it to the ground
how the he's not a wire wrist misspend
that's a rib strong brace rip he's not
fighting static he fighting cancer some
notes about installing motherboards
they're really delicate you should be
really careful with them and screw in
with confidence but also don't screw in
too hard otherwise scroll in with
confidence
I write his spire pay close attention to
the brace that goes at the back of the
computer you always have to make sure
the brace that's not the brace brace for
your arm for your teeth that's an i/o
shield his ingress so bad so bad it's
pretty fast Ram it's two thousand six
hundred and sixty six megahertz I
believe so it's princess I can run 30
two hundred megahertz so once you hear
that solving clasp and you don't see the
gold connectors on the side anymore
that's when you know the RAM is in step
three we're going to install hold on he
installed the memory incorrect it'd be
side-by-side they should be spaced out
for that mother bow I've look at the
menu where that's the wrong way speaking
of the memory I wish I could erase this
one I chose this format of solid-state
drive so that I could input it into the
motherboard without having to worry
about extra wires or putting it in a
separate part of the case and just
getting really messy that's true
you don't want another thing that you
can mess up and you're gonna line this
bracket with the back end bracket or
your PC bracket no random phrases so all
you have to do is take the brick and
make sure that you align it with these
little insulating pads so the power
supply isn't short-circuit and come into
contact with the rest of the system
watch in serration pad those are
vibration paths so the power surprised
doesn't rattle around make a wrap-up
noise it's not going to shock you press
you have your ribs strong brace right
off me you don't have to
oh my god if Kyle were here right now he
would his pants slide it in nice and
easy until you have a snug fit going to
shock and short-circuit the powers of
prayin case always be sure to try to
place hold on hold on one second here
always be sure wait right oh it's you
rookie that you can't air there's no fan
install on the radiator he just mount
the radiator before the fan the fan
cannot go on top of the case this case
does not support it that way how he
gonna another fan rater I don't know
then again how am I even surprised at
this point but in this case no pun
intended there's nothing special about
this stringing process they're just
really long screws because they go
through the entire frame of the cooler
used the wrong wrong screw he should use
the small one those wrong screw for when
you have to fan on the same side he's
going to drill holes into the heatsink
of the radiator oh my goodness my family
in China who made this proper cringing
so hard right now
and they take forever because in this
case you need to match those cables with
the correct descriptions on the power
supply typically you want to put the
cables in the power surprise first some
cases very difficult to put it in after
the fact he kuraki he has a nice case
we're installing the CPU the heart of
the computer or the brain depending on
how you look at it so right we're just
gonna remove the plastic covering that
they put on the motherboard we're just
gonna take this little plastic part out
don't break it
toss that out of here suppose CPU holder
or rather slot CPU holder Oh strap it's
called a socket my friend you don't put
it in the Sun you put something else in
the strap but not a CPU that's a photo
socket
and we're gonna use the CPU applicator
this is a special little part that not
everyone may get but this motherboard
that we got from Asus definitely does
have its coldest abuse relation tool it
makes it really useful if you want to
install a core i7 hexa core CPU
yeah we've got one and it's an
eighth-generation shape
super exclusive you can only buy it on
every major retailer in the world
so what having this little installer
does for you is it's basically a brace
that you can how you install you
followed this guy you have no idea how
to play so we're about to apply thermal
paste of the CPU every CPU cooler
actually comes with a bit of thermal
paste already neatly applied in a circle
around it but it's usually not enough
it's good essentially PC building
practice to have a little bit extra no
I'm Larry
oh so you oh my god what'd he do it's a
CPU you're not icing a cake okay we're
going to stop sign oh my god he used the
whole tube or what so you're gonna see
that there are four Jesus Oh Mike here
oh I got Jackson Pollock painting oh my
physically come in contact with Italy
basically keep it cool
take thumb screws like this and just
screw them on so now that our internals
are done we're gonna flip all the panels
back on which is the top glass sight
glass front glass and of course the back
panel where priests know will he built
the PC oh my cable management this fully
built the people what does this that you
have such a good case
no cable management Brooke franca
spaghetti everything's put together and
we got to the post screen so what's next
amazing big a surprise so far he got to
the post screen ladies and gentlemen
rounds of a pros this has to be the
worst PC building video of all time and
I should know I wrote the book on how to
not build a PC very scary someone who
build a PC for the first time might
think this is a good video to Faro and
their PC X Pro they don't know the video
bad because they disabled or I can dis
Reich and their comment so much
censorship feel like I'm back in China
please if you make a tutorial make sure
you know how to do
what you're trying to tell people to do
it's a simple concept by my spraining
Jesus okay I go now
I feel bad I just in a bad mood go to
drink bring my sorrow thank you for
watching subscribe to Cairo channel
maybe I take over the channel someday
who know you know stay sexy peace let's
write history</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
