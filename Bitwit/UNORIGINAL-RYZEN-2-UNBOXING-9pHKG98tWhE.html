what's going on guys welcome back today
I am unboxing some second-generation
Rison chips because right now that's the
only thing us tech reviewers can do with
these chips the unboxing embargo has
just lifted but you'll have to wait a
little bit longer just a little bit
longer until our reviews come out but
this is still exciting this is of course
as I mentioned the second generation of
rise in the 2000 series successor to the
1000 series of course and I have two big
boxes with me today both of which I'm
sure are filled with goodies so uh which
one should i do first let's do the big
one first and we'll save the Rison box
for last got to keep that audience
retention high alright so what do we got
here so opening this guy up okay bring
your imagination to life second
generation the intelligent processor
this is our first item which is oh sorry
I just bumped the mic sorry rip
headphone users I haven't practiced this
this round this is just a really rusty
on-the-fly unboxing but look at this
this is the MSI x4 70 gaming m7 a see we
get AC Wi-Fi on this bad boy that's nice
mystic light RGB of course looks like
it's got some some vrm heat sinks and
stuff reinforced PCIe slot X 470 is of
course the latest chipset that's
optimized for Rison - but it's also
worth mentioning that these are
backwards compatible chips you could
slot a 2000 series CPU into an existing
a m4 motherboard like an X the next 370
for example and it would work just fine
the only difference is that X 470 gets
you a couple nice features that the
older generation of boards will not for
example precision boost - which is kind
of like a built-in overclock for your
CPU it's a really simplified way to save
or exif r2 which can be very your cpu
and a nice little boost as well so those
are exclusive to the x4 70 platform
you'll have to upgrade the Vette if you
want to take full advantage of the 2000
series but here look at this play this
board
I won't show it up too much because I'm
planning to do a build with this board
already it's already on the calendar
already scheduled a very nice PC build
with this board and of course a brand
new rising to processors so we'll put
that aside for now because there's a lot
more stuff to cover and here at the are
oh gee that's a big box crosshair seven
hero Wi-Fi Wi-Fi I'm glad that Wi-Fi is
starting to become more of a popular
thing on full-size ATX or even ATX
motherboards because we all need a
little Wi-Fi in our lives once in a
while of course Ethernet is still king
but look at this board holy moly
holy moly that's a sexy board I love AC
sports I love their BIOS ease there UEFI
they're very reliable I mean a lot of
boards are reliable but Ted personally
the best luck with AC sports in my own
experience this is a very sexy board
I'll have to do a build with this one
too
why not look at that I just wanted to
take all the plastic wrap off but I I'm
gonna I'm gonna control myself I'll save
it for later
excellent anything else in here I can't
imagine as much else to compel one more
bonus value add memory yes memory is
also worth talking about for this launch
because we can now support up to 4,000
megahertz ddr4 which is quite a bit
faster than we saw in the first
generation of Verizon whether or not
we'll actually see memory kits hit that
rated speed on the new platform remains
to be seen but I have high hopes this is
the sniper x-series from g.skill we get
what is it sixteen gigabytes I would
presume yes 16 gigs of DDR for 3400
speed good stuff and it's kind of got
this nice white camo aesthetic on the
modules I'm sure I'll be using this at
some point soon alright that was it for
the big box pretty quick a pretty pretty
painless say now it's time to move on to
the good stuff these I would assume are
are rising to CPU
am i right I am Oh would have put a
beautiful overhead shot good job me
all right so it looks like we got some
little notice here that fell down
AMD horizon 7 2700 x with wraith prism
that's got a rainbow effect that she
called the wraith wraith bow prison I'm
getting off topic here all right so it
says desktop processors higher
performance incredible technology
intelligent rise and processors just got
even smarter eight cores twenty
megabytes of cache unlocked little
asterisks with a bunch of text next to
it
highest multi processing performance you
can get on a mainstream desktop PC I
guess we'll see about that
for more information visit AMD calm
thanks alright ooh what do we got here
AMD Rison 520 600 X and AMD Rison 720
700 X we gotta go with the risin fibers
we'll save the best for last people as
usual so oh you know what I don't have a
box cutter I don't have box cutter
hold on I always do this in hindsight I
probably should have been running with
this open anyway what do we got here so
before I unbox this guy I want to
quickly point out that these 2000 series
CPUs all have a couple things in common
for one they're using the Zen plus core
not to be confused with Zen to that's
something different entirely then we've
also got a 12 nanometer process node or
node process down from 14 so essentially
we're cramming more transistors into the
same space more or less which should
equate to higher performance also keep
in mind that these CPUs and any other
chips launching this month belong to the
consumer level family of second gen
Rison CPUs and that does not include
second gen Rison pro or second gen rice
and thread Ripper CPUs that those are
launching later at a later time that I
don't even know when those come out but
we could be seeing a staggered launch
with mainstream Rison just like we saw
with the 1000 series where we have Rison
7 come out first and then rising 5
followed by Rison 3 i think that
the order so I don't know how they're
doing it this year I would I would
imagine some somewhat the same but I
don't know all the things so I'm cutting
this guy open the horizon 520 600 X of
course successor to the horizon 5 1600 X
very popular CPU also makes me wonder
actually I think we confirmed that there
will be a risin 520 600 I mean I think
that's obvious but I don't know if it
was officially stated at any rate what
I'm saying is if that's the case and and
we're to follow the 1000 series most
people are probably gonna buy the 2600
9xq
as it will probably be the better bang
for the buck as was its predecessor the
CPU features six cores and twelve
threads just like the chip it's
replacing but the clock speeds have
actually been much improved so right out
of the box we're getting a base clock of
3.7 gigahertz with a max boost of 4.2
which is pretty impressive when you
consider risin 5 first gen was hardly
able to hit 4.0 gigahertz I mean you had
to have a really nice bin CPU for that
if we're gonna see some nice performance
gains from these chips over their
predecessors its most likely gonna be
due to that new and improved
architecture and the bumped up clock
speeds because the core count and thread
count for all these CPUs as we're aware
currently are going to stay the same so
that is the 20 or I'm sorry the 2600 X
risin 5 CPU will put that guy right back
in here so you guys don't freak out have
a heart attack
all right and let's move on to the 2700
oh god I don't think there was anything
else in there nope we're good all right
Verizon 720 700 X replaces the 1700 X
with the same 8 cores and 16 threads but
we do of course have higher
out-of-the-box frequencies with a 3.7
gigahertz base and 4.3 gigahertz
max boost would you look at that that's
actually pretty sexy maybe we can get a
4.5 gigahertz overclock on this guy who
even knows let's take a look here we
don't know the TDP s of these chips but
if we're going off of the last gen this
is gonna be a 95 or higher watt TDP
ship and the risin 5:20 600x that we
just looked at would probably be 95
issue as well of course we'll just have
to wait and see let's pop this sucker
open take a closer look you know I don't
even know what the point of this is
because it looks exactly the same as all
the other rides and CPUs on the market
for the most part but there it is now I
can say I did it and you can say you saw
it
alright maybe you want a backside like
that ass hey check them pins out it's
exactly the same pins to same layout
still why few sauces give me a look I'd
like to point out that AMD already
confirmed that all the 2000 series chips
are going to be using a soldered IHS
whereas Raven Ridge ap use are currently
using a thermal interface material which
is not as good temperatures go way up
with Tim they go way down when it's
soldered the reason why the Raven Ridge
AP users are using Tim is because
they're lower powered CPUs to begin with
and it's a lot more expensive when
you're soldering an IHS to the actual
CPU so that's why they went that route
it works for Raven Ridge because it's
low powered but for the 2000 series we
are getting full-blown soldered IHS is
very much like the first generation
before them so that is exciting news and
that is the most I can talk about this
CPU or either of these CPUs Burnett so
case closed there I guess the last thing
we can talk about here Braith prism
oh yeah let's do it let's pop this
sucker open what do we got here now this
is the new cooler from AMD new stop
cooler alright let's let's hope it is
cooler
a literal sense gotta be careful with
that pre-applied Tim right there just
speaking of Tim from what I can tell
this looks just like the Wraith max
except it's got a clear fan now so it
gives you additional RGB illumination
and all that it's got a four pin PWM
connected with a nice blacks leaving
same sort of mounting mechanism with a
little lever that you pull back and oh
what's what's out got I got my finger in
the thermal paste alright so what
is this this is a switch was there a
switch on the wraith max it says l and h
low and high but either controls the fan
speed or perhaps the RGB brightness I
would hope fan speed that's actually
pretty cool I don't think the wraith max
had that did it I don't know it doesn't
seem like it did but it could be wrong
and here we've got some ports for the
cables that you'll need if you want to
light this sucker up with the RGB well
that's it guys I've literally unboxed
everything I possibly can and there's
nothing left for me to do here so I'm
closing the video out but that is also
say I'm super excited to be testing the
2000 series can't wait to see how they
perform if you guys would like to see my
coverage on these beautiful chips go
ahead and get subscribe to the channel
so you don't miss a darn thing apart
from that guy stuff like on the video if
you enjoyed it you can subscribe to
already said that floatplane if you'd
like to watch my videos a week early
without ads I'll put a link in the
description below
apart from that thank you guys for
tuning in have a good one and I'll see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
