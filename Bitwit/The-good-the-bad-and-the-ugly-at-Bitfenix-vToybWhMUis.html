brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below this is the
BitFenix sabre they actually have it on
a bit of a pedestal here so I can't
really get too close maybe I'll get some
b-roll of clothes later but as you can
see here don't mind that magnetic cover
that's not actually stuck so what you
see here is a relatively closed left
front panel which I'm not so hot about I
think there is some intake strips just
on the on the sides there on either side
but remains to be seen how effective
that's really going to be I also can't
really tell how close the front panel is
to the front fans hopefully not too
close RGB strips on the front there are
some LED hotspots but they've reassured
me that that is going to be fixed and
smoothed out for the final four the
final product you can also see we've got
a 240 millimeter radiator option at the
top 360 at the front power supply
basement this is they're targeting this
at around 89 US dollars so not too
shabby actually the sub 100 dollar
market is full of options now we'll see
how this competes when it finally
launches later this year I'd be much
more interested in something like the
Nova mesh of the Nova mesh TG which has
a full mesh front panel for unimpeded
airflow this is this is what we're
talking about here I also kind of like
how the the plastic framing on the
inside has been sort of stylized because
they know that you're gonna be able to
see whatever structural integrity is
required in here so it actually doesn't
look too bad I mean depending on who you
ask
it's all subjective of course RGB fans
in here I don't believe those come stock
it comes included with two 120
millimeter non RGB fans so you'll have
to upgrade those if you want a bit more
bling to your to your system we also
have a power supply shroud with
perforated holes here but the final
version will not actually have these
holes they'll be solid for a
significantly cleaner look although you
are removing a bit of ventilation there
we also have 240 millimeter support at
the top with a removable dust filter
magnetic and 360 millimetre radiator at
the front one quick thing to point out
is at the front panel here actually also
serves as the dust filter so there's no
dust filter behind this this is already
fine enough mesh to just pop it off and
spray it down or wash it off put in the
dishwasher if you want
you're ready to clean now BitFenix has
acknowledged the shoddy cable management
job here this is just for demo purposes
but just a quick look you can see we've
got one two and three two and a half
inch drive mounts for your SSDs a nice
big power supply basement with you know
hopefully enough room to store the bulk
of the cable as you see here there's
also a hard drive cage down here for two
three and a half inch drives you can see
here at the front we actually do have
quite a bit of space for a radiator so
you can easily do a push or pull
configuration if you pull the front
panel off you actually do have room for
fans on top of this frame so you could
actually do a push pull right here and
you wouldn't really be affecting airflow
because again full front mesh so it
could be literally a couple millimeters
away from the front panel and you would
still get pretty decent airflow coming
through you've also got your choice of
black or white here it is sort of an
empty shell no parks installed I can
like the white looks pretty nice of
course it's going to reflect that RGB
lighting very nicely if you if you
actually cram any in here and the
pricing is also very competitive so for
the non tempered glass that just comes
with a solid panel fifty-nine bucks not
too bad and then ten dollars more so 69
us if you want to go TG this is the dawn
TG and it's a complete prototype right
now so this is all subject to change
just really quick on the inside looks
like 360 at the front 240 at the top
seems like a lot of BitFenix cases are
stacked with this configuration of
radiator support which I don't mind
power supply shroud this one actually
has a cutout so you can actually see the
power supply it looks like there's an
LCD as well with a postcode error
currently I'm sure I'm sure they're
looking into that right now the main
selling point that they seem to be
talking about on this case is the design
on the outside so you can kind of see we
have sort of a checkered style pattern
that partially covers the front panel
and then wraps around to the side and
this is all supposed to light up very
evenly and brightly kind of like how you
see on that poster right there now this
is a prototype so they don't actually
have a working sample because we're
still trying to figure out exactly how
to go about lighting this up so thinking
about optical fiber so that they can
actually have the light travel
throughout the entire panel because if
you just had LEDs on one side or the
other then you would probably have a
really bright area on one end and then
super dim on on the other
so it's a big problem they're trying to
solve I think the bigger problem they
should be looking at for this case
however is airflow because look at how
low this we tell those panel ghosts
where where is it getting intake from
okay I guess I guess you've got the site
I just now saw the sides which is
extremely thin really thin okay so maybe
there's a way that they can widen those
I think that's possible so they are
targeting this case that around 120 130
dollars us which i think is a little bit
steep if they are going to keep the
current airflow system I mean it needs a
bit more intake support I think in order
to charge over 100 bucks for it
people who are not cramming super hot
running components in here who just
really love the way it looks and you
know just can't live without it I
suppose it might be worth it to them but
I think the biggest challenge here for
BitFenix is to find a way to increase
the amount of intake because just just
from looking at it I don't even need to
review this thing it looks pretty closed
off so hopefully they can figure that
out in time for launch thanks for
watching with coverage of BitFenix guys
