around with an idea for a while now and
I think it's finally time that I told
you about it in a nutshell i'm going to
start producing a reality ish web series
called system config that documents my
experiences with the new service i'll be
offering where i build you a computer
now think of it like pimp my ride but
with computers instead of cars and no
exhibit I'll be filming the entire
process from picking out the parts to
installing windows but here's the kicker
you are an integral part of the video
each episode of system config will start
with the clients story where they're
from what they do and most importantly
why they need a new computer whether
it's a hardcore gamer who needs more
horsepower or single father of five who
needs a communal computer in the living
room each episode of system config will
be entirely unique the client also
reveals their budget in the video which
will largely determine the tier of
componentry for their build after the
groundwork is laid down the Clinton I
will choose which parts are best suited
for the system based on budget and
desired level of functionality at that
point the episode goes back to me and my
bat cave where I conduct the actual
build and provide commentary about my
experience now I'm still deciding
whether this portion will be a time
lapse or just the main bits and pieces
strewn together so bear with me as I
hash out the details in the meantime at
the end of the video I deliver the
finished rig to the client and follow up
with them a few weeks later to hear
about how their experience is going with
their new machine that'll pretty much be
the format for each episode of system
config more or less now of course you'll
have to buy the components with your own
hard-earned drug money but the service
itself is absolutely free with the
exception of shipping costs besides that
I won't be charging a dime I am however
accepting tips no homo the main benefit
I'll be getting out of this service is
having more unique video content for
awesomesauce news and a new fun way to
engage with all of you guys as for now I
can't really commit to offering the
service indefinitely until the end of
time but if the feedback is positive
enough after the first few episodes I'll
probably keep doing it for a while we'll
just have to see how it goes now
unfortunately I can only offer the
service to white people totally joking
however all clients will have to be us
to be eligible for this service America
now let's talk about payment and
shipping options for a second because
it's a little tricky now in a perfect
world you would buy all the components
and ship them to me but that means I'd
have to give you my address and don't
get me wrong I love you guys to death
but I don't want one of you showing up
on my doorstep one day with a sharpie
asking me to sign your left man boot now
take away the man portion of that and
let's have lunch sometime my solution to
that is you would transfer the money to
my paypal account which I then used to
buy the parts myself and then have them
shipped to my house I build the system
ship it to you when I'm done and
everyone lives happily ever after lastly
I wanted to mention that I won't be able
to build a computer for every single
person that wants one even if you apply
and you are eligible you may never get a
response from me simply because there
are so many of you and only one of me
however don't let that discourage you
from applying because then I'll have no
content and that'll be bad to apply send
me a private message on YouTube with
your name and email address write me a
little something about yourself and why
exactly you need a new system also let
me know in the comments what you think
of system config so far and if you'd be
interested in watching it when it
premieres that's all I got for now guys
thank you for awesome saucing and I'll
see you all in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
