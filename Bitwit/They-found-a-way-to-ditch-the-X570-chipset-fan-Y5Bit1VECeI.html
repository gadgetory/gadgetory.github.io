brought to you by fantex coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below
we're at the gigabyte booth gigabyte
booth say hi wave hi you look really
weird you lose so awkward what a little
weirdo alright so this is an x5 70
motherboard this is the thing I'm most
excited to talk about here at Computex
2019 is all the exercise 70 goodness
this new platform from AMD featuring
their new horizon 3000 series processors
there's actually a rising 3rd gen Zen 2
chip underneath this big cooler here but
they won't tell me what kind it is I'm
wondering if it's a 16 core that'd be
pretty awesome but since we can't talk
about that right now let's talk about
the thing underneath it which is a PCI
Express MDOT two nvme expansion card if
I can just no guess oh there we go okay
cool sorry it's super reflective I can't
remove this stupid acrylic panel so
basically we've got four m2 nvme slots
alright
that's support PCIe gen 4 so that gives
us an incredible amount of bandwidth
that is giving us 15,000 megabits per
second read and write approximately
which is absolutely insane now they
actually tested this with for populated
drives on an Intel platform Z 390 board
and it only recognizes two of the drives
because it's just simply not enough and
with with PCIe gen3 this is really where
it's that I mean aim D did some demos
with graphics cards showing you know the
bandwidth that's available on PCIT gen 4
but it doesn't really make a lot of
sense right now because even PCIe gen3
isn't being fully saturated by most GPUs
these days on the other hand nvme Drive
can certainly take advantage of that
extra Headroom additionally also worth
noting that you can do up to 8 terabytes
of storage total so they have 4 2
terabyte drives populating this guy
right now which is insane I like the
backplate to that's cool it's a bit more
of an extreme solution of course or if
you're a bit more reasonable or have a
more limited budget like myself we have
a single SSD right there and nvme that's
the Auris and VM a Gen 4 SSD 2 terabyte
drive nice big copper heat sink for
thermal connectivity goodness and even
with that single driver still getting a
very respectable 5 gigabytes
read and write or if I gigabytes read
and about 4200 megabits per second right
jeez okay now we're gonna do X 570
boards here this is this is the bee's
knees right here and this is the X 570
or s Pro Y 5 Mini ITX right now only
gigabyte and Asus are making
x5 70 boards in this form factor mainly
because the x5 70 chipset gets sobering
and hot it's kind of hard to cool it on
a such a small surface area like this
but by god they've done it look at that
little fin so cute they've got two
laters I'm here this is actually
completely metal I thought this was
plastic at first but that's just for
extra heat dissipation that's actually
coming straight from where the MOSFETs
are so this whole thing is designed to
keep the X 570 chips that cool and
apparently according to gigabytes doing
a bang-up job we also have two DIMM
slots right there ddr4 which can get
much higher speeds than we saw on X 470
and lots of connectivity this is a fully
featured board apparently big things do
come in small packages and look at the
i/o here yo yo we actually have plenty
of USB 3 USB 3.1 gen2 type-c Wi-Fi
onboard very essential for a mini ITX
port dual hdmi and displayport out and I
believe that's a Gigabit Ethernet LAN
don't quote me on that though these are
more of the mid-range boards X 570 horas
Pro we've got the X 570 horas ultra and
the horas master ok the master being the
higher end one of the three now you're
pretty much gonna scale upwards in terms
of feature sets it may be a bit more
flair when it comes to RGB lighting I'm
not gonna focus too much on these boards
but the one that I really did want to
drive home is this guy the X 570 or
extreme this is the very first time that
Intel is actually bringing the extreme
line of their motherboards to AMD this
has previously been reserved for Intel
but this board is absolutely insane it's
completely over engineered you can see
all of the cover plates that are on this
thing are completely metallic they're
actually there's no plastic on this
thing pretty much whatsoever and it's
actually a functional purpose and
although it does look very nice it's
actually helping to keep the X 570 chips
that cool and what's very special about
this board is that since it's using heat
sinks as opposed to fans it doesn't have
any active cooling this is completely
passive and you know like like pretty
much any fan they're eventually going to
fail at some point so it's just kind of
guarantees the longevity of the board
overall excellent cooling they've even
thrown in a full blown back plate on
this thing oh I forgot to mention
there's actually a back plate on the the
mini ITX port - I'm sure Chris will get
a biro shot of that but we have a very
nice Finn's back here this is actually a
true heatsink and that's just some
really really fancy looking thing that
looks cool RGB right there I think is
that are you know that's actually just
used to your design okay nevermind I
actually kinda like the blacked out
stealth look what
shaking your head I see I see you
lurking I see you lurking Oh Pedro
shaking his head hey Pedro
yeah Pedro if you guys follow the
pcmasterrace I've read it he is he's
he's the owner he's the moderator he
created he you invented the PC
master-race
can I just shake your hand really quick
sorry it's a left-handed shake cuz I
block it with my right I love you Pedro
steak will everyone go follow the
pcmasterrace subreddit so basically this
board is extremely insane I have no idea
what the price point it's gonna be but
it's going to be obviously more than
these boards and not for the faint of
heart but incredibly over-engineered
also these boards are featuring full 16
phase power ok there's no doublers here
like you see on competing boards so
we're actually getting a true 16 phase
power design board that's going to be
exceptional for overclocking and
enthusiasts all around also the i/o is
oh my god it's a lot of Io ok you can
just look at it I'm gonna talk about it
just there that's a lot alright last
thing about this board an I'll shut up
look at the ports the ports on the side
ok they're all right angle ok very clean
it's gonna be great for cable management
and I love the fact that the actual
heatsink is covering it up completely
which I would love to see this board
installed in the full system too just to
see how effective this cable routing
strategy is very promising so far ok
well there's a lot of other technology
here at the gigabyte suite but none of
it contains a mdx 570 so it doesn't
really interest me all right let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
