to you by be quiet cable mod verda gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info
all right guys about the gigabyte booth
or the suite Taipei 101 check it out
wait thought of you're recording yeah
we're good I just roll it we're going
alright look at this xqn motherboards is
all I care about
pretty sweet right so we've got the
Auris lineup here this is the gaming
three sort of your more basic
entry-level model let's say you don't
want all the bells and whistles then you
might want off for this especially if
you're just looking for a straight-up X
299 and you know maybe court sky like X
or KB like X support right out of the
box is what you want you want to spend a
ton on the motherboard I've surveyed you
guys in the past you're like we don't
want to spend more than $200 on the
motherboard which I completely agree and
while I cannot confirm or deny price
guarantee you this is going to be one of
the cheaper boards in the x-29 lineup
from good old gigabytes so does being
said you still get some really nice base
features here obviously you get quad
channel memory support support for the
latest ascetics give like if you're like
X processors 1 2 3 4 5 PCIe gen3 slots
right there especially these two kind of
nice will reinforce ones with the LEDs
have a nice touch nice tool LED on the
chips that he think as well and if we
look at the middle of the motherboard we
get a pair of m dot two nvme SSD slots
right there which we're going to talk
more about in a little bit and down here
I don't know if you can see but there's
a digital LED header so if you wanted to
connect an addressable LED strip you
could easily do so that seems to be the
latest craze these days addressable LEDs
kind of like what we've seen with the
NZXT 2 plus just being able to really
have a lot more customization features
and signals being sent to the LEDs so
that they're not all having to conform
to each other so you have a lot more fun
effects to play with going down the line
here we have the gaming 7 you can see
that this one's a little bit more lit AF
breath there's a bunch more lighting
zones you actually get this nice little
chipset heatsink upgrade for this little
plate here you can remove that you can
sort of customize the logo that you want
here you're a modder for example I'm
sure some system integrators will have
their own version of this you get one
two three four five PCIe
gen 3 slots all the same as the the
gaming three however all of these
feature RGB LEDs get RGB LEDs between
the the DIMM slots on the motherboard of
course you get one two three m dot two
you can see that these two are pretty
much the same as we saw in the gaming
three but the third one actually has a
heatsink which got it's got this
metallic plate here with some thermal
pads underneath for additional cooling I
was talking to Matt from gigabyte and he
was saying that they distant testing on
the 960 Pro for Samsung nvme SSD within
four minutes without that he think it
was throttling and then they actually
put the hissing back on and it went for
24 hours straight with no throttling
whatsoever so that's a--that's a good
version performance right there but of
course we're going to see some more
reviewers perhaps myself even do some
more in-depth thermal testing but there
you have the horas gaming seven let's
mosey on over to the gaming 9 really
quick and this is sort of via the
flagship motherboard X 299 on the
gigabyte side of things you get all the
same lighting zones and all the same
basic features I didn't want to mention
that on the gaming 7 it does also have a
USB 3.1 type C header which the gaming 3
does not have so bear that in mind
additionally you also get all the same
features that we saw before but look now
you get these em dots you heatsinks on
all three of your mq slot as far as
audio is concerned you actually get the
highest sound fidelity with the gaming 9
it's a small step down with the gaming 7
and the bass version of that audio chip
with the gaming 3 now the fourth
motherboard here is the XQ 99 Oris altra
gaming which is actually sort of an
interesting position right in between
the gaming 3 and the gaming 7 so you'll
see it's just as lit literally as the
gaming 7 is so pretty much all the same
led zones except for the audio solution
this is actually still rocking the same
audio solution as the gaming 3 so not
quite the same fidelity as the 7 or 9
and it's also lacking the the led
feature
cover the LED plate over the audio chip
as well we also get 3m 2 slots with one
heatsink included whereas on the gaming
3 you only get 2 as I mentioned earlier
and you also are getting that same sort
of customisable chipset if you're
perhaps a moderate or feeling like just
making this more of your own this is the
last board that I want to talk about
this would be x2 99u d4 and this board
is super special because it's basically
a gaming 3 board with none of the
I think this is going to appeal to a lot
of us who don't really care about the
gaming centric features we don't care
about RGB LEDs we just want a board that
doesn't look like like terrible that
isn't going to cost us an arm and a leg
because at the end of the day what this
is really about here folks and where I
feel like most of us are excited
including myself is just being able to
support a skylit connect or a cable ache
X processor so for those of us who are
just looking to get on the new Intel HED
keen platform this might be a really
great option for not too much money we
see none of the RGB LEDs the the rear
i/o cover is just completely gone you're
just trying to build a system for
performance this is really for the the
purist in all of us so you can bet your
bottom dollar that this is going to be
the chiefest X $2.99 board in gigabytes
line up of course I can't confirm
pricing at this moment but I've been
informed by the gigabyte staff that June
19th is when we're going to be able to
preorder these boards and that's also
when we're going to find out exactly how
much they cost so keep your eyes out for
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
