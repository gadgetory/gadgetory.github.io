at the new Mini ITX case from fractal
design that comes in at just 70 USD this
is the Nano s no relation to the AMD r9
nano although they do both pride
themselves for being great performers
despite their small size which I can
definitely relate to while the case is
notably smaller that it's big ATX bro
the define s the Nano beers on the
larger side for a mini ITX chassis which
opens up some possibilities for things
like water cooling full-sized hardware
support and hassle free cable management
which will circle back to later
cosmetically speaking the Nano s is
pretty much a mini-me version of the
define s staying true to fractals
minimalistic design a plastic faux
brushed aluminum finish lines the front
panel with a blue power LED front and
center I was kind of hoping that fractal
would have finally made this LED white
to match the fans inside the case but I
guess if you start making everything
white then people start asking questions
we get that same old familiar side
ventilation at the front for healthy
intake and popping off the panel reveals
sound dampening material lining the
inside and a removable dust filter for
an included GP 14 140 millimeter fan
here you can also install a 240 or 280
millimeter radiator using the mounting
strips for optimal positioning and
clearance something to note here is the
dust filter wouldn't fit back on
properly once I installed the 240 read
from my AIO
turns out to the small washers that came
with the cooler were interfering so I
had to remove them in order to get the
dust filter to stick for those who need
it there's plenty of room underneath the
front panel to house additional fans for
push-pull configurations though you will
have to cast aside that dust filter in
doing so at the top of the case are your
audio jacks power and reset buttons 2
USB 3 and fractals trademarked Maju vent
cover that promotes quiet operation with
the same sound deadening material we
found at the front when removed with the
small latches inside the case you have
the option to mount a 240 red or 2 140
millimeter fans just be aware that if
you plan on installing a radiator here
that clearance will be limited based on
the height of your RAM and vrm heat
sinks so in the spirit of Chris Hansen
always remember to count before you
mount moving along to the back our fan
strips that house and included gp120
with support for 120 millimeter radiator
and two expansion slots for our mini
the X board on the bottom are four shiny
feet with rubber pads which surround a
front-loading removable dust filter for
the power supply an optional 120
millimeter fan both side panels feature
captive thumb screws with the right side
using Dada sound dampening material and
the left sporting a generous window that
shows off pretty much everything except
a fair portion of your power supply
which I really wish you could see more
of said no one ever taking a look inside
the sturdy metal frame we see a layout
that's more akin to a typical ATX tower
that lends itself greatly to the define
s in both form and function surrounding
the pre installed standoffs our five
rubber grommets which I found to be well
placed and well sized during my build
having the grommets span along the edges
of the motherboard really makes for tidy
cable routing regardless of connector
placement on your boards PCB and there's
even a small cutout just below the board
for things like HD audio or front panel
connectors the grommet near the ATX
power supply is plenty wide just so long
as you don't have a lengthy PSU and
while units up to 160 millimeters long
are supported I would recommend going as
short as possible to give your graphics
card more breathing room as my MSI
gaming GTX 960 was already a centimeter
away from teabagging the power supply
while it's still a better love story
than Twilight there's a chance that the
PSU is close proximity could mean higher
temps for typical GPU coolers with two
or three fans as a result blower style
cards AIO GPUs and custom water-cooled
cards are probably ideal candidates for
the note s I mentioned earlier the cases
support for full-sized hardware and the
Nano certainly delivers in this arena
accommodating CPU coolers up to 160
millimeters tall and graphics cards up
to 315 millimeters long with the front
fans installed your GPU clearance may be
cut down of course if you choose to add
a radiator water cooling pump or
reservoir to the mix like the define s
the nano features what I've so cleverly
dubbed the reservoir with vertical
strips and an included bracket for
mounting almost any reservoir or pump
rest combo as a proud owner of the
define s I can confidently say this
feature is simple and effective and
makes custom water cooling noobs like
myself look almost competent at the
floor of the case is a modular bracket
that can be used to mount a multitude of
things like D D C and D 5 pumps one two
and a half inch or one three and a half
inch drive by loosening its four screws
beneath the case the bracket can slide
along a pair of mounting rails for
flexible position
this is also where you can mount that
after mentioned 120 millimeter fan
though both can't be installed
concurrently to the right of the
reservoir you get a couple small cutouts
for routing fan cables through keeping
them out of sight and out of mind and
taking a look at my finished build here
you can see that the tubes on my AIO are
a bit long for this case cozying right
up to the side panel window like the
baby from that creepy Windows 10 ad on
the flip side we see the rest of our
drive mounts in the form of two
removable mounting brackets each held in
place by a single captive thumb screw
for easy installation the first mounting
plate behind the reservoir sports four
rubber pads and can house either a two
and a half inch or three and a half inch
drive using the included mounting screws
covering the large CPU cooler cutout is
a dual SSD tray giving us support for a
total of four drives in the Nano s cable
management in the Nano was an absolute
delight as you get anywhere from 17 to
35 millimetres of space behind the
motherboard tray with three velcro
straps and plenty of tie down points
along the edges of the case providing
enough room and anchors here to save
even the worst cable managers in fact
there's so much unused space below the
hard drive plate in particular that
fractal probably could have squeezed in
the PWM fan hub here this would have
made sense given the cases numerous fan
mounts and the limited number of fan
headers typically found on mini ATX
boards surely this was a way to keep the
MSRP of the case to a minimum because
I'm sure fractal knows the only thing
cheaper than the included three pin fan
splitter is all of us all things
considered and to sum up this review
quite frankly the Nano s is a welcome
addition to the mini ITX family fractal
has managed to take many of the things
that work for the define s and
incorporate them into a case a fraction
of the size without making too many
compromises well it does have its
shortcomings the amount of custom water
cooling and hardware support here is
pretty impressive for a small
form-factor and I think most folks will
find building in the Nano to be much
like building in an ATX tower with that
familiar sense of spaciousness at the
Super Value price of just 70 bucks the
Nano s is definitely a strong contender
in the rapidly growing market of
enthusiasts small form-factor chassis
