premium sound for all-around listening
receive a free mass drop mini mic if you
order through the link below in the next
two days what's going on guys and
welcome back to the channel hope you're
all doing well today we're taking a look
at a brand new case from NZXT this is
their H 700 I as part of their new H
series of cases this is actually the
flagship model at $200 u.s. and Miss RP
it is pretty steep is actually one of
the more expensive cases I've taken a
look at in recent months to be honest
but it does come jam-packed with a ton
of features some of you guys might find
pretty interesting so we'll be taking a
full look at all of that to date this is
a mid tower ATX actually up to e ATX
motherboards are supported and the build
quality first off I just want to talk
about the exterior here is built like a
tank we've got full metal and glass
construction for the most part
everything from the front and top panels
to the side the tempered glass side
panel here absolutely looks fantastic
and really just feels rock-solid there
is a metal side panel on the left as
well that has a quick release latch a
button on the back side which drops it
down I did not realize that when I first
took it out of the box and tried to pry
the the side panel off with my bare
fingers and actually ended up snapping
off one of the plastic latches so shame
on and DXT for using plastic for that
latch and shame on me for being an idiot
additionally this also kind of gives a
unique look to the case all these sort
of ventilated holes here that is full on
ventilation there is no dust filtration
behind these holes with the exception of
the front there is a dedicated dust
filter that covers a three included a or
F 120 fans
you also get an A or F 140 at the back
with flexible mounting strips you could
also slot in a 120 it looks like
additionally you can take the top panel
off and that will reveal radiator
mounting to get up to 280 or 360 either
at the front or the top so plenty of
water cooling options for front IO we've
got audio and headphone jacks two USB
three two USB 2 and a power button with
a led around it there is no reset on
this case be aware and it's got a very
nice sort of minimalistic look very akin
to the s3 40 in some ways of course
everyone's going to have
their own opinions on what looks better
this or that you guys let me know in the
comments below what you think
additionally on the backside here we do
have a reservoir mount which is pretty
cool that would go right in front of
your graphics cards there's another one
on the very iconic blue bar that now
kind of goes over the power supply
shroud and then additionally on the back
we have a removable PSU bracket so you
would actually insert that unit from
behind also as you can see this case is
lifted off the floor with the four
rubber feet that so that's about gives
you about an inch of clearance so you
don't actually suffocate the power
supply at the bottom which if you mount
fan down you do get a dedicated dust
filter for that slides in and out very
easily and securely it also feels
high-quality even though it is made of
plastic now in addition to all this one
of the top selling points that NZXT has
really been trying to drive home with
this case is the integrated RGB lighting
there's actually a strip that's
pre-built in right at the top they
include an additional strip that you can
place wherever in the case and that
connects to an integrated built in Smart
Hub which kind of acts like a grid plus
and a hue plus so it gives you fan
control and RGB lighting control
functionality in one small device that
actually is mounted behind the top
portion of this blue bar here we're
gonna take a closer look at that well
that's really interesting because it
actually uses machine learning in order
to give you a custom tailor-made fan
curve based on your system thermals and
noise levels which is pretty sweet so
whether all of this adds up to being
worth two hundred dollars remains to be
seen till the end of the video but for
now let's go ahead and crack this guy
open and start building inside of the H
700 I alright so here we are taking a
look at the inside for the first time
you'll notice that we have pre-installed
stand ups which is great for an ATX
motherboard which we will be using today
no rubber grommets on this end of the
case you can see there's just a really
wide cutout here where you can route
your cables so not exactly sure how that
would look unless you had like a
radiator or some fans here to block out
that cabling not sure exactly if it
would look messy or not but you don't
get any rubber grommets the right side
gets a pass because it just has this
huge cable routing bar that you could
pretty much just pass cables underneath
and you wouldn't really see where
they're coming out of from the
motherboard tray anyway but let's just
go ahead and mount our ATX board in here
we're rocking
x2 99 system today I've already sort of
prepped the motherboard in the interest
of time
io panel has already been installed
there we go this is the gaming pro
gaming Pro carbon a/c x2 99 board from
MSI with a 70 960 X I believe it's a 16
core 32 thread part for those of you
interested and I like how the middle
standoff is a little bit raised so it
just helps you get aligned that much
easier alright our motherboard is
installed for the most part and since
we've got in a i/o here also courtesy of
NZXT we're gonna actually mount this to
the top
now before we change angles here you'll
also notice that you get a nice look at
our built-in RGB strip here and as I
mentioned earlier NZXT also includes
another flexible strip for you to mount
anywhere else in your case and you can
see connect it right here but more on
that later let's get this radiator
installed so you guys are looking at the
top of the case right now with the top
panel removed of course and we've
actually got some flexible mounting
strips once again for up to a two
hundred and eighty or three hundred and
sixty millimeter radiator this bracket
this whole black bracket is actually
removable first off it's made of steel
very sturdy it's got four thumb screws
here which are incredibly tight out of
the box so you'll need a screwdriver at
first to let them loose and once those
are removed this bracket seems to just
pop out like that wait one moment
while I fix this to the radiator yes I
know I'm putting fractal venturi x' on
an NZXT Aereo Sumi I like to be
incestuous sometimes don't quote me on
that that can be taken out of context
way too easily so this would go in like
so righteous so it looks like the only
way you to route these to the back of
the motherboard tray is just underneath
or to the right of the radiator through
the actual bracket which doesn't seem
like the most elegant mounting solution
or a routing solution but it does seem
to be covered by that blue cable
management bar I'll just route these
over here for now I'm not gonna plug
them in just yet we'll get around to
that power supply mount is fairly
straightforward we got four thumb screws
which will remove this bracket and you
fix the bracket to the power supply
and in everything goes from the back
side of the chassis looks like these are
captive as well one little piece useful
little end go the cables followed by the
power supply and we have nearly an
infinite amount of power supply
clearance as you'll see in just a moment
let me get this guy screwed in now you
get quite a few mounting options for
SSDs or two and a half inch drives
rather inside of this case first off
you've got a mounting point right here
these are all removable trays so you get
one right here and two on top of your
power supply shroud as well as two more
behind your motherboard tray which we'll
take a look at later but this is
actually pretty cool these are fully to
list so there's a little a little bar
here that you push down on and that just
kind of easily releases the tray you'd
obviously need four screws to mount the
SSD to the tray but putting it back is
also a breeze you can kind of just push
down like that and it goes back into
place it gets even cooler on top of the
power supply shroud so all of these
ventilation holes actually serve as a
sort of mountable grid where you can
actually place these trays anywhere on
the grid and I should also mention that
they're they're fairly sturdy once
they're locked in they don't wiggle
around at all you can even mount it this
way mount it horizontally like that if
you wanted to you could remove one or
both of them it's actually kind of fun
it's sort of like building with Legos in
a sense and additionally you also get
some mounting or some routing holes
behind those trays for your state of
cables there's also a mounting hole
behind this cable bar right here if you
were to mount a drive to this tray here
we only have one SSD that's going in
this system I say we mount it to this
one because I'm kind of curious as to
how the routing goes from behind this
bar hopefully we don't have to remove
the bar in order to get the cables over
here so I was gonna mount this and
actually wire it up right now but it
seems that in order to get access to the
cable routing hole behind this bar you
kind of need to remove the drive cage
that's underneath this power supply
shroud so why don't we take a look at
the drive cage first and then we'll come
back to mounting this SSD so here's a
look at the drive cage it can support up
to two two and a half inch or three and
a half inch drives and it looks like
we've got some thumb screws here which
if you undo
you can remove the drive trays
individually for easy mounting they are
steel this is this is a huge plus a lot
of times drive cages I get overlooked
and the manufacturers cheap out on
materials using some really thin plastic
at things like that but these looked
very sturdy happy about that
additionally you might notice that this
entire cage can be removed so it's fully
modular the cooler part however is that
the cage itself is mounted onto these
rails so that if you loosen the four
screws at the bottom of the case you can
slide this entire cage all the way front
or all the way back to give you either
more clearance for a radiator at the
front or more cable routing room for
your power supply etc so that's actually
very flexible in fact I'm going to
remove my drive cage entirely we need
like I said earlier access to that cable
routing hole for our SSD at the front of
the case drive cage is fully removed now
I'm gonna try to pass our SATA cable
alright there we go and now for our
power cable alright it seems like it's
actually pretty easy to get those cables
routed through that hole even though it
is relatively small flipping it around
to the other side you can now see we've
got the necessary connections for our
SSD I'm gonna plug those in first and
now we can mount it back to the case
there it is super clean looking actually
love the way that works out so guys just
bear with me a moment I'm gonna route
all of our front panel connectors to the
motherboard which shouldn't take me too
long I should also mention that this
case has two USB 2.0 front panel
connectors a one's actually I guess not
a front panel connector it's for your
Smart Hub so in order for the Smart Hub
to interface with cam etc you will need
to connect it to a USB 2 header on your
board so bear that in mind in order to
take full advantage of all this cases
connectivity and features you will need
2 USB 2 headers on your mainboard as I'm
wiring up this 24 pin ATX cable looks
pretty cramped up here there's almost
like no no way for me to route this
cable behind the side of the bar kinda
throughout it up top of the bar if you
know what I mean which I don't
personally mine but some people will but
if you had some sleeved extensions maybe
some fabric ones or some paracord for
example you'd probably be able to get
away with routing it you know underneath
this tight space but otherwise if you
got a big bulky cable like I do right
now pretty much you got to route it
towards the top I guess it would also
help if you had a right angle 24 pin
connector on your board as well but
clearly we don't now before we install
our graphics card I want to quickly
point out that you don't actually need
to remove this blue bar here in order to
do your build unless of course you want
to do some more tidy with these cables
as I mentioned earlier it's kind of hard
to get this 24 pin underneath this
portion of the bar you can't remove the
bar if you want to add some more
flexibility there I think there's three
screws one at the top one at the bottom
and one at the back or actually on the
side here holding it in place very
simple and easy to remove doesn't take
much time at all but you don't actually
need to remove it in order to complete
your build so that's good news
let's move on to the graphics card we're
gonna be installing a reference rx Vega
64 because up until this point the only
thing I've really done with it besides
the launch video and initial benchmarks
is keep it in the background of my other
videos as a set problem and considering
how frickin expensive and hard to find
these cards are I felt like it was a
disservice just leaving it sitting there
collecting dust for so long so now we
get to put it in the build it doesn't
really quite match I don't know it
doesn't really match but it kind of does
that the contrast is it's kind of eye
catching to me very standard mounting
procedure with the graphics cards here
in the H 700 I get some thumb screws you
get one two three four five six seven
expansion slots B yotaphone let's finish
wiring this sucker up now where should
the VGA cables come from do we put them
up from okay so this slot here just
doing some tidying over here don't mind
me alright guys at this point we are
ready to tackle our cable management and
I got to be honest this case has some of
the best-looking cable management
features I have seen in a mid-tower in
quite some time
the cable channels that they've kind of
pre-installed here first of which are
fully modular so if you
like any of this and you don't like to
design or direction that NZXT is going
with this sort of style of cable
management you can remove all of it so
there's really not much to complain
about in that department but if you want
to keep it around these channels kind of
give you even if you're a first-time or
novice builder it really gives you a
good idea of where these cables should
be flowing and the sort of path they
should be taking behind your motherboard
tray additionally you've got a bunch of
velcro straps to keep everything flat
that way you can actually mount your
power your your power supply your side
panel on additionally we also have those
two more SSD trays at the back they are
sort of these little trays that are
mounted with a single thumb screw on
each one very simple and straightforward
pretty familiar design that we've seen
now I should mention the the smart hub
that's built in here is say the powered
so you'll need to keep that in mind and
there are only three PWM four pin
headers on that device however you could
attach a couple splitters to it it looks
like NZXT already done that so you can
expand the number of fans you connect to
this thing significantly so currently
they already have all four of the
included fans wired up to that Smart Hub
and you get an additional one two three
four available connectors for four more
fans and we do have the two that we had
on the a i/o which we are going to be
connecting and as well
boom and boom and continue tidying up
these cables and there it is folks
within about a minute to a minute and a
half we are done with our cable
management for the most part thanks to
the ingenious cable routing channels
that we have here I actually think they
worked quite well this was a total
no-brainer and the only issue I would
say is like the when you have all the
fan splitters and the fan headers it
gets a little bit bunched up in this
area let's actually see if we can put
the side panel on without much issue
just so we can verify now remember I did
break the the top latch one of the
latches here so it's not gonna mount
flush but that goes on just super easy
even if this was not broken I'm sure it
would it would go on just fine but that
is great that is some fantastic cable
managed
and not to mention you get the power
supply shroud as well so you can hide
any excess cabling under there also look
at this this guy 50/50 connector was
just chilling here it's kind of nice to
already have that ready to go out of the
box not used to that but it is something
I could definitely get used to I should
also mention if the LED strip that they
include is not only RGB but magnetic as
well which is a huge plus so at this
point people we are ready to slap back
on our panels and fire this up for the
first time and that way we can start
messing around with our Smart Hub to see
exactly how that works
alright guys so I spend a good chunk of
time in the cam software getting
acquainted with the adaptive noise
reduction feature that interfaces with
our smart hub inside of this case and
the way it works is you open up the cam
software and you go through about an
hour-long calibration process during
that time you can't really use your
system regularly it basically just tests
it for a full hour puts it under load
tests all the the temperatures and noise
emissions that load versus idle and then
after that our cam will spit out a
custom adaptive fan curve that is in
theory going to be better suited for
your system than say a preset fan curve
and it actually does give you a chart
comparing temperatures and noise
emissions from from a preset fan curve
versus the new adaptive curve we
actually saw a three degree reduction
going from preset to adaptive on our CPU
I'm going from 64 to 61 degrees Celsius
which isn't too bad
and our GPU which is the reference rx
Vega 64 dropped five degrees Celsius
going from 74 to 69 degrees C combined
we've essentially just shaved eight
degrees Celsius off of our two main
components here by basically doing
nothing as far as acoustics go going
from the preset to the adaptive fan
curve basically didn't make a difference
in fact we actually incur 2.3 decibel
noise increase so the system got a
fraction louder even though you can't
really hear it to the naked ear but I
think that's maybe attributed to the
fact that we have a reference rx Vega 64
in here with a very loud blower style
fan that would potentially drown out any
sort of noise benefit that the adaptive
fan curve might have given us so it just
goes to show that the effectiveness of
this technology is really gonna vary
from system to system which makes it
infinitely difficult for me to tell you
guys how it's going to impact your rigs
at home and that sort of just makes it
even more difficult to justify the sort
of premium price that is attached to
this case I can really only speak on
behalf of my own data which is that the
system is now running a bit cooler but
it's still just as loud as it was before
we ran that whole calibration process at
the end of the day though this is a
great case I mean
has a ton of great features it's
modernized for 2017 with the exception
of no USB 3.1 type C at the front panel
which I forgot to mention earlier but
why why doesn't it have it I don't
understand but other than that it's got
a ton of custom water-cooling support
much more than the s 340 or the H 440
however I feel like if you're not doing
some heavy custom water cooling users of
the SS 340 or s 340 elite aren't gonna
be missing much with the H 700 I unless
you really value that Smart Hub device
and adaptive fan curve technology those
are my two cents on this case guys let
me know what your own thoughts are in
the comments below do you think it's
worth the 200 odd price tag blow that
 up and be sure to toss a like on
the video if you enjoyed it it does help
a lot as always guys I'm halibut wits
thank you guys so much for watching stay
tuned for more tech stuff coming at you
really soon and I will see y'all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
