doing an unboxing and quick overview of
this video card from sapphire this is
the Radeon HD 7870 and it is the
gigahertz Edition which means it comes
factory overclocked right out of the box
so just a few specs I wanted to list off
really quick before I open up the box
this card does feature AMD's 28
nanometer GCN that's graphic core next
architecture it's pretty much known for
being able to fit a ton of transistors
on a very small area which is pretty
badass
it does come clocked at 10 50 megahertz
and I did mention earlier that it is
factory overclocked gigahertz Edition
right there it does have two gigs of
gddr5 memory clocked to twelve hundred
and fifty megahertz and that's on a 256
bit interface aside from that this card
also does feature
AMD's HD 3d technology as well as
Eyefinity 2.0 and lastly sapphire does
recommend that you have a 500 watt or
greater power supply if you're gonna be
running one of these cards alright so
I'm moving on to the fun stuff see what
we get inside so first off we've got
some foam packaging that's always good
very thoughtful of sapphire here we have
the card itself all wrapped in bubble
wrap put that down right there you get a
crossfire X Bridge right here by the way
this did not come like this this is
actually an open box product right here
so when it comes shipped this is gonna
be in a plastic bag so don't freak out
it's not sapphires fault just using use
products this one however is in a
plastic bag because it's fairly useless
for a product like this this is your VGA
to dual link DVI it's kind of blurry but
you don't need to see that anyway
hopefully you never have to use that
with this card packaging and we have
another unwrapped adapter cuz this one
is useful this is a mini DisplayPort I
swear I need a cameraman but this is a
mini DisplayPort to regular DisplayPort
adaptor and you've also got these two
adapters as well this is molex to PCI
Express so basically if your power
supply doesn't have any more PCIe
connectors on them and you have some
molex connectors left you can go ahead
and use these compare your card and you
also get quick installation guide your a
driver installation CD with a little
case patch it's always best to go to the
manufacturer website and make sure that
you have the latest drivers as the ones
on the disc can can be outdated most of
the time and lastly you get a little
pamphlet
basically tells you how to register your
product in case you ever need support
from sapphire in the future which
hopefully you never do alright guys we
finally made it to the card itself so
taking a look at the front here we can
see two 80 millimeter fans and they both
say dual X on them dual X is what
sapphire is calling their aftermarket
cooling design for this card which
basically consists of the fans the
aluminum fin or a beneath it and the
black plastic shroud that covers most of
the card there are some gaps on the
sides as you can see so you will have
air coming out from those sides keep
that in mind when you're configuring
your build and aside from that you also
get four copper heat pipes coming from
that fin array for maximum thermal
dissipation and you also get a pci-e 3.0
connector of course I forgot to mention
earlier that this card is pcie 3.0
compatible and on this side here we've
got a sapphire HD 7870 sticker and two
6-pin PCI II power connectors right
there on here we got a turquoise PCB
definitely not the reference design and
on the back finally we have some
ventilation holes for added air flow and
your video outs so two mini displayport
outs 11.4 a HDMI out which is also
capable of doing 3d video output and
lastly your dual link DVI connector
alright guys that wraps up this overview
and quick unboxing once again this has
been the Sapphire Radeon HD 7870
gigahertz edition if you guys enjoyed
