attacks oh I'm sure it's a cousin or
he's lying right there in the pathway
why is she doing that so like he like
weaved through the camera and under here
where there's cables everywhere because
he doesn't care he's just a large dog
and he's like I will go there and we
can't like put him in the room closed
door cuz he'll literally just tear
through the door probably you probably
you're live streaming YouTube started
and like right in the middle of that
explanation so oh it might not make much
sense but we are live that's okay all
right so um welcome to the show guys
sorry we're late if you guys are used to
watching us on a weekly basis then that
probably doesn't faze you too much
you're probably used to it but we have a
mediocre show planned for you guys today
we'd have not done much show prep I'll
be honest it's a light ship it's gonna
be a light show it's like the Tech Talk
version of awesome hardware is what
we're going and that is not an insult
no I respect every view I'm very good I
have a good flow you know just not plan
anything you'll never have to plan
anything which is brilliant
they're like they're like the poster
child for like it we'll do it live
type of things so that's what we're
gonna try today we do have stuff planned
though we do have some stuff planned
it's not just because we hate everything
and we don't want to do the show it's
mainly because we had a bunch of other
stuff to take care of before
Thanksgiving week it's Thanksgiving week
there's it's a lot of chaos and
commotion both for our channels as well
as each of our families everywhere
around the world people are preparing
for Thanksgiving and all the nations I
don't know it's an American home yeah
even even Canada Canadia has a different
Thanksgiving Canadian Thanksgiving yeah
but it's not it's very similar but it's
like Canadian bacon which is ham the
only difference between Canadian
Thanksgiving is that they're just more
thankful than we are and they're they're
so thankful they're almost like they
feel bad about it so they apologize yeah
sorry's giving but anyway what was I
saying
this is episode 85 live show in case you
guys are new here not at all and I do
every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time
we streamed the show into two halves the
first half this week is on my twitch
channel which are TV slash bigwig Kai
and then after we get to channel oh yes
no it's my it's my my twitch channel is
bit with Kai I know but we're not
streaming to your twitch channel right
now we're not we're streaming to awesome
hardware oh yeah you're right you're
right god
hey I drink enough beer and your YouTube
chin and my YouTube judge good lord okay
so let me start that over this is a live
show that we do every week we split them
into two halves it's gonna be on awesome
hardware on Twitch a hundred percent of
the time we won't ever cut unless we
like have some technical difficulties on
YouTube however we split that up into
two halves the first half this week is
on my youtube channel which is
youtube.com slash c / bit wit and then
we're gonna take a break a short short
intermission so Paul and I can both
probably pee or something or get more
beer and then we're gonna go to Paul's
YouTube channel which is youtube.com
slash Paul's hardware that is correct
that yeah yes got it right on the scene
like what I don't pregame as much I feel
like I just my flow is gone I lose my
mojo
I'm not coherent it's like you know I
need the alcohol time to really make sex
you should have a beard and you're right
Paul why don't we do that now because we
actually have delicious spirits to drink
you're still working on I'm still
working on my pre-show I'm sort of
getting over just a tiny bit of a head
cold so I'm gonna take it slightly easy
tonight which is why I'm only drinking
it's 10% Porter after this title
starting off with the Sequoia red ale
Sequoia red this is from current River
Brewing Company I was actually in
Burnsville not too long ago for my for
my and my actually my wife's really oh
yeah so we went to Korean ville I was
there for the first time and our Airbnb
was directly across the street from her
in river brewing up in Kern County yep
they got some good beer there in that
Brewing Company the only craft beer over
near in yo Kern in Ukraine so I'm
checking out of the pols hardware mug
which what do we owe ya like what a
transition there yeah I know wait oh so
that's the problem here right so do me
will do mine first
you
yes cat was drinking out of a Paul's
hardware English pub glass which you can
purchase for yourself at Paul's are
brunette if you'd like to help support
what we do on our YouTube channels yeah
I also have lots of other shirts some
mugs new stuff is the tri-blend shirts
and a different few different varieties
oh my gosh the organic cotton beanies
are sold out those were popular I do
have more of those coming in so if you
were interested in one of those they're
really cool there'll be more of them
soon I also do decals and some ladies
step them everywhere shirts yes gals
calsters bit wit tech slash store yeah
and I've got two new designs well
actually I guess one design that I've
slapped onto three different items the
first of which is a t-shirt so this is
the tri-blend it's very nice super sexy
I saw disturbed I don't know if you just
disturb medic James and we play each
one's dealing with a lot he treated me a
picture of him wearing that shirt it
looks freaking fantastic guys those are
new also if you want the more classic
cotton black-and-whites that's there too
and because it's cold usually in most
parts of the world that aren't Southern
California you can also get that in a
hoodie version black and white basic
moves hoodies woo 45 bucks the quality
is quite good and we have a nice
selection like if you like the hoodie
with the with the pouch in the front for
the hands you know cows got you covered
there if you want the zippered one I
have those over on my store and where
you beanie ferny I guess it's cool
enough right now in your garage to to
rock it I can't do beanies personally
because I have so much hair and it just
like traps all the heat I have I have
the logo kind of offset here at a jaunty
angle makes you look a little bit look
like you're gonna rob a house or
something
yeah rob a bank you can also put a dead
center if you want I don't know where do
you want the screw wait should this
group this group looks better off to the
side maybe because it's like it's still
visible from people who are like looking
at you straight on but it's not like in
your face like notice the screw screw
you and it's organic so it kind of gives
you a like a sense of superiority it's
non-gmo gluten-free
the other thing that I wanted to mention
as far as announcements go I think this
is our last one is that we are hosting a
giveaway starting tomorrow oh yeah we've
been kind of teasing this and mentioning
it on Twitter and stuff and also in some
recent video updates but we made a
ton of money from selling a bunch of
hardware that we needed to get rid of we
liquidated our assets as Paul said and
there's all the cash those are all
Hondo's of course when you see the hundo
in the front that automatically means
all the bills behind it must also be
hundos so we're rich now we're rich
bitch but what we're gonna be doing with
this cash is giving it away to you guys
at least a good chunk of it so stay
tuned for details tomorrow the first
place corner will win a thousand of
those dollars one grand one grand second
place winner yes we're including two
winners to this giveaway so you have
twice the chance of winning
theoretically the second-place winner
will win $500 and that's just straight
cash PayPal giveaway International
everybody it's gonna be good starts
tomorrow after we released the video
that we'll be posting to both of our
channels it's actually the same video
that you'll be seeing on either of our
channels but you should watch both of
them just to give us the ad revenue
while you wait list us on at blocker and
so um but that is all I have to say for
announcements so why don't we get into
the short news segment that I have
planned here which is the first topic
Emmis I just released or they announced
I should say this GTX 10:50 TI GPU yeah
okay it's already been out who cares but
this one's kind of cool it's low profile
and if you look at it you can
immediately see what they're talking
about here it's low profile from a width
standpoint so it's actually a half slot
PCI PCI slot is that like home half
length or half length or half half
height half height F height PCI slot
thank you Paul which is kind of like you
don't see those too much anymore on
modern cases for like enthusiasts and
stuff but you do see them quite a bit on
like older pre-built desktops so like
the HP pavilions and things like that
they usually only have a lot of them
have 1/2 slot PCI expansion slots which
you could not fix a typical gtx 1050 TI
or any modern GPU for that matter high
end GPU in one of those desktops and a
lot of the times you know games are
heavily GPU or graphically intensive on
the video card side not so much the cpu
so even if you
have like not the highest-end pre-built
desktop that you use for like Microsoft
Word and stuff dropping in a entry level
video card can actually give you quite
some quite a decent amount of gaming
performance especially now with the
possibility of having 1/2 slot card 1050
Ti which both Paul and I have done
reviews and stuff on has proven to be a
pretty capable little card for the
hundred fifty bucks or so that you pay
for it yeah so I think this is also
coming in at around one hundred and
thirty nine ninety nine speculated it's
run on the same stock speeds and
reference video outputs which is not a
bad thing they do have all three of the
video outs on their DVI HDMI and
DisplayPort yeah I mean and one of the
key features of the 1050 Ti is instead
of really low TDP said it's a very power
efficient card so there's actually no
PCI Express port that you have to worry
about on here that's the one concern
about sticking in even a mid-range or
even some low end GPUs inside of a
prebuilt is that often times your power
supply won't be able to support even a 6
pin PCI connector so with this it goes
straight into the motherboard it
receives all of its power directly
through the PCIe slot 75 Watts rated and
you're good to go so you have to worry
about or even you know potentially
getting like the molex to PCIe connector
for your power supply so I see I see a
pretty viable option for I mean if you
look at something like a node - OH -
like fractal you know there any of those
very slim mini ITX cases that are a
little bit taller cuz you know if they
usually have the motherboard and CPU in
one section and then usually rise a card
or a ribbon cable for the graphics card
further down but you could now do like a
mini ITX so many ITEX boards even have
like an external power brick and then
you know if you've got PCIe a PCI
Express slot then you can do like you
know a build you can can a scratch build
something or maybe maybe there I'm sure
there are cases also for half fight
cards like that but yeah be cool to do a
gaming system is something like that
that you build yourself and can upgrade
versus I mean there's there's other
options in that range you know like so
tech there's a lot of little mini PCs
and stuff like that
yeah a lot of time they you know they're
they're integrating like the GPU onto
the custom like motherboard or something
like that to fit it all in there but
yeah cool yeah it's up some
possibilities there so stay tuned for
that in case that's your you're in that
sort of boat
the next story on our list is about
Netflix I just saw this at the top of
the the front page on the hardware
subreddit about Netflix requiring some
outlandish things to stream video
playback at 4k so what is exactly what
exactly is Netflix requiring their users
to have hardware wise and software wise
in order to stream things like
gilmoregirls o 4k which was a huge
emphasis in this article they really
want to emphasize that gilmoregirls is
gonna be streamed and available in 4k
for all of you hardcore jiejie fans or
yeah that's Gigi Gigi um so all about
the G so the first thing that you're
gonna need to stream 4k if you want to
get on that bandwagon is Windows 10 so
anyone who's on an operating system
that's other than that isn't that gonna
be able to do it which already kind of
hints at some DRM agencies but I think
most people right now who have pcs are
either on Windows 10 or have the ability
to upgrade without much cost to them
they're probably gonna want to upgrade
to Windows 10 eventually once you know
support for 8.1 so it's getting phased
out but that's that's a requirement
which I'm like I mean it kind of sucks
because I'm so on Windows 8.1 myself on
hotline and I know you are on arctic
panther I know you're not but because I
have dumb I am on Windows 10 everywhere
except with HTPC you can just do on
windows 7 because it uses the Windows
Media Center for for DVR stuff okay so
but any any anyone else you like I know
Joker productions he's very adamant
about not dinner keys my keys
oh yeah bottle opener on your keys yes
there's like you're gonna need to take
your car first
what's the emergency so um like I'm
saying like I know Jeff productions
there's also a guy who's like very
adamant about not upgrading to Windows
10 he's like no screw that
things working perfectly fine for me
right now on 8.1 so I can get the
frustration for some users who are still
on that operating system who would like
to stream stuff on 4k but even even if I
wanted to Paul even if I did upgrade to
Windows 10 and it because I wanted to I
still could not stream 4k Netflix you
know why because the other requirement I
didn't really give you enough time to
yeah you thought you were gonna you know
yeah I apologize take a shot in the dark
so the other requirement that they're
putting on users is that you have to
have a KB Lake processor so that's I
mean that's something that none of us
have right now I mean so that's it's
impossible to watch Gilmore Girls yeah
on Netflix in 4k what is easy to do with
yourself with that nobody can GG so
that's right right now the only actually
that's not sure you can buy it you can
get a KB like process here in a laptop I
was gonna say the only device right now
is device that supports I just
completely ignore those yeah knowledge
that does exist so the only thing that
the only device right now that fits the
bill that has Windows 10 and a KB Lake
processor that's listed on Microsoft's
website anyway is the Lenovo yoga 9 10
so hey if you want a stream if you
really need your for kgg fix that badly
just go get a yoga 910 spend you know
$1,100 on that or whatever it costs and
and it's totally worth it but wait
there's more pulp because there's one
more requirement that you need in order
to stream 4k Netflix which is the most
ridiculous of them all Microsoft edge
you need to use the edge browser
alright I'm canceling my order how much
how much is I was pretty close I said
1,100 it's a thousand forty nine a
thousand fifty thousand one one thousand
fifty if you buy directly from the
Lenovo it's website if you want the
friends though they're just the latest
Windows 10 update gives you like puts
the goddamn edge look like I keep
removing it from the tray yeah puts it
back again also keeps putting goddamn
candy crush back on the computer so I
don't blame Joe Kerr at all for doing
this
like those of us who have upgraded
haven't we can bitch about it and then
the edges that's like a little pop-up
like little things like you did you know
and you can do some with
Pinterest I don't what you you weren't
supposed to be there it's so intrusive
like yeah it really is if I've really
gone and removed it Microsoft and like
done all that stuff for for the edge
browser that I just I don't want to use
it right now you know do you think
really a Windows Update that puts it
back and suddenly does some annoying as
 as oh maybe I should give it a try
like now that you mention it very
aggressively and without my permission I
think I might be interested yeah no
thanks
so that is a huge clusterfuck of
requirements that Microsoft has not said
or Netflix has not mentioned why that is
why those requirements are in place but
we can assume or speculate Gilmore Girls
fans are just hardcore they will it
doesn't matter
thank you think you'd be and also your
firstborn child must be sacrificed
yes something I got back I gotta have my
okay sorry it's it's it's the new
phenomenon that's replacing crack
cocaine everyone sweeping the nation is
a new epidemic called Gilmore Girls in
4k but the articles saying these
requirements are likely due to hardware
based DRM which and HEV C decoding
features which I guess makes the most
sense out of all of this because nothing
else does which is quite a shame I'm
gonna go it's my phone because that's
discord I mean I like disable
notifications from that discord on your
phone I said you future but what the
 Netflix I guess they are in bed
officially with my but there's there's
other 4k programming like available on
Netflix right like you've been able to
stream Netflix 4k this isn't this isn't
like the 4k debut I don't know I mean I
don't have a 4k TV unlike some people I
just got one I'm making a video and I
got I got a great deal via slick deals
and I got it at Target it was less than
800 it was after tax and everything it
was like seven hundred and eighty or
seven hundred and ninety dollars for 65
inch
for K LG TV I helped him set it up today
it's pretty nice actually
I deal was ridiculous like I couldn't
not get it you'd be losing money if you
didn't buy that I don't know something
about something about slick deals when
when you see the fire icon you like I
have to buy whatever that I don't care
it's like I believe I believe Austin
Evans because he always uses the fire
emoji so strategically and it's like
conditioned me to think that anything
that has a fire emoji next to it must be
amazing
must be hot thanks Austin okay okay so
what's next next up is a donation really
quick automatic tech everybody I was
doing the transition right as you
started talking about the next thing we
got the donation cycle are handing us
money literally putting money in our
hands it's amazing automatic tech five
dollar donation thank you very much
which is better for gaming at for half
speaking of 4k which is better for
gaming at 4k on a 4k freesync monitor to
rx4 80s on with crossfire as written
strangely or a gtx 1070 so i would say
go for 4k well now the two Rx for 80s
are probably going to out for outperform
at just 1017 I disappear with whatever
you in in a lot of the stuff but the
1070 is gonna provide a more consistent
gaming experience because scaling with
the multi-gpu setup is it's not reliable
it can theoretically get you higher
frame rates than a single faster card
sometimes but then other times it won't
sand sometimes games don't scale at all
or they don't support crossfire so what
I would say is buy the most expensive
GPU the fastest GPU that you can afford
and work your way up from that because
right the man says he has a free sync
monitor you want to take advantage of
precinct yeah here's what you should do
get one 480 right now wait for me wait
one or two months hopefully not more
than that one or two maybe three months
for AMD to release their top-end stuff
which is supposed to be happening I mean
I really hope they don't push it back
more than
one two three months but you'll be fine
with the 484 now turn some settings then
don't play at 4k play it plate 1440 or
something like that what if he already
has a 4k monitor he just he says that he
says he has that was the premise of the
question didn't say he had one which is
better for gaming at 4k on a 4k freesync
monitor that's the basis of the question
that is the foundation yes the
foundation but yeah he hasn't we haven't
verified ownership okay don't already
have this all right if you already have
a more capable the freezing monitor then
that is what I would say to do get a 40
now and upgrade to whatever their top
end card is yeah no for the Vegas play
1080 for a while until Vega comes out
yeah okay come suit oh my god pub
Shepherd sorry I forgot upset they what
take that question very seriously well
you you were telling him misinformation
nope how about information
misinformation it was clearly wrong no I
did not say anything like that I said by
the fastest GPU you know which I don't
know I guess big it could be that know
your information was good in general I
was I was honing in on the free sink
thing and it needs us like I'd hate to
say I have somebody said I had this
really nice free sink monitor and I did
not say I did not tell him to get an
Nvidia card though I said by the fasces
GPU but they made him board
yep had you let me finish I could have
completed the thought but you know like
right now that's like if you're gonna
polish my 480 or wait for the next gen
stuff to come out cuz I mean I guess you
could I guess alright you can go about
getting on your own a fury and r9 fury
don't get the fury X like I don't know
if you can get a good deal on an iron in
fury that made another good option okay
yeah
all right pup Shepherd really quick $20
donation thank you very much sir I sent
Kyle a package was it your package have
a drink on me I'm a drink um we are
gonna be doing mail time my half of the
show so if you send anything and I have
a lot of theirs they're all back here
behind us did you get did you receive
anything from a pup Shepherd I I don't I
don't know that's I believe that is an
Internet not real name I feel like
that's how we should all address our
mail though too
it's like whatever your username is
online they should smell so much also
how you should like write your return
address and stuff I've also I've also
wondered many times as pup Shepherd does
that mean he Shepherds doglike puppies
like little puppies
is he a shepherd of heirs his name pup
and he is a shepherd or is this last
name of Shepherd well maybe he's like an
amateur early beginner Shepherd and so
he's like a pup of shepherds you're
right it could be taken mate it's very
ambiguous confusing you're a man of many
mysteries and other such absolutely
probably never has made the truth
probably never know what if his package
is just a puppy all right back on track
here let's talk about our third story
third and final story for my half the
show which is about AMD I briefly skim
this article so sorry if it's not super
in-depth or if I get anything not 100%
accurate you guys are used to that
though AMD is not apparently not
limiting their color depth on HDMI to
point out is in capital letters yes it's
a overclocked 3d net thank you for this
article they made it very apparent that
AMD is not limiting color depth on the
HDMI 2.0 standard apparently a lot of
articles are reporting contrary it was
one one it was one main article that was
picked up by a couple a couple more
legitimate tech source tech you know
taking outlets tech outlets you know
tech news outlets that were more
reputable that and then and then kind of
snowballed from there like the internet
usually does yeah but apparently the
issue doesn't lie with AMD
aimed he's not cutting off or limiting
the color reproduction or the color
depth I should say it's basically the
limitations of HDMI 2.0 the standard
itself there just isn't enough bandwidth
with that connection to actually support
a full HDMI you know chroma without any
kind of Chrome
with subsampling signal 2.0 B so there's
2.0 B and there's no 2.1 in the future
and stuff but what the articles saying
is hdmi 2.0 was never really intended to
support HDR at 4k at least with four for
four is it four by four is that how they
say the the chroma subsampling do they
say four by four by four I think it's
just four for four I read it I read it
all the time but I don't hear many
people talking about it obviously so I
don't know how it's actually spoken I've
mostly heard people say four four four
four four four four to zero or four to
two okay so basically and Paul was
explaining this a little bit to me
earlier is that four four four is kind
of like pristine uncompressed throughput
so that's basically what we all want
right we don't want any kind of
compression we want to see the colors
completely filled out as they as they
are intended but that requires a lot of
bandwidth that the HDMI 2.0 standard
doesn't have if it doesn't have that
bandwidth you can do what's called a
chroma subsampling and that is
indicative of the numbers or the ratios
four to two or four to zero and that's
what's currently supported with by AMD
at the moment so um basically we're
waiting on a treat EMI 2.0 or probably
2.1 2.1 or another future or display for
dungeons yeah that's the other place
that's the other topic that they brought
up was like why hasn't TV just dropped
HDMI altogether and adopted DisplayPort
because it's been known to have way more
bandwidth and HDMI is kind of just
holding the entire movement back so to
speak it's also royalty-free DisplayPort
is a royalty-free standard which is all
the more reason to switch over HDMI is
not that's never sense to me either HDMI
is just too prevalent everywhere in
people or more likely to buy a new TV
with a ports that they know they they're
familiar with and that they've used
before and they can plug in their
existing blu-ray player or something
like that it's kind of like why don't we
all just have like electric vehicles
overnight because will you
were pretty much its induct Hrant like
gasoline vehicles are in doctrine into
our society right now it's gonna take a
while to transition to something
completely different
and granted that's probably a way bigger
topic than which cable you're using
let's dive into that one let's talk
about fossil fuel oh god no let's let's
that's let's get to the bottom no never
mind never pick too thick to lay on
right now you're not prepared but yeah
that's what's going on with with that so
that's all you need to know that's all
you need to know that's all the articles
so that's all I read so I don't want to
go on and spout some more glaber's I
mean from because I didn't see this a
few days ago I don't recall what the
there was a there was a tweaked out
article on this too
I forget where the original article was
from it might have been a German website
or something like that
see Germans Germans see gentlemen if I
forget I've read it briefly and then as
I got all right let's move on to pick my
PC okay let's do that I asked you guys
for some last-minute submissions
I was running short on content for my
half so I was like let's do it you guys
delivered you sure did starting with big
old group I don't know if that's how you
pronounce your name sorry but it looks
like you're rocking this define the
define define our fourth fourth what I
say um all right GTX 670 haven't seen
that card in a build in a while with an
Intel Xeon e3 1230 v2 670 is a classic
yes it is
I remember that EBG call my both ran six
70s for a while we did that was a good
card I had the Asus direct see you -
that was a great card actually I really
like that one I still have it still have
it still kicking although it's not
really commissioned right now anyway yes
I think mine's actually back in the box
which one did you have at the same
exactly he's his latest one with the
chrome they're the they made the chrome
pipes on the side look like they were
like on a chopper or something
grateful alright so basically when I
would say right here right off the bat
is ketchup and mustard cables that's a
pretty obvious one it just makes the
build look more on the budget side but
with a couple extensions you can make it
look a bit more premium give it a more
high-end look and feel I would say I
like the cooler I mean it's probably a
really good one who looks like it's a
it's not a knock to a cooler natively
that's a site I'm using back to it but
then I have a fan on it but I rather
like kind of how it looks I think maybe
if you put some more not to a fans in
the case like some maintenance
moogan moogan moogan let's do do some
serious like custom sleeving and spray
painting and custom work the only thing
that I can really rent like I can use to
remedy 1230 v10 awkward not to a fan is
more not to a fans does that make sense
like you have this one not to a fan that
just kind of throws everything off even
if you have your muscle even black lines
to erase the doctor you must embrace the
night to a fan and implement more of
them paint throughout your whole case
this interesting shade of brown or
maroon or something in it like that
1980s
chassis yeah beige chassis and stick
stick that all that stuff in there but
yeah that's what I would do maybe get
the sticker off that power supply and
cable management looks pretty good
though
yeah um solid this being pet my PC you
know I'm gonna I'm gonna provide the
opposing answer to this one
this is a nice system you obviously
don't have much of a color scheme and
that's totally fine
this is I mean I don't know when you put
this together or if you built it up
overtime or anything like that but I bet
this is a very nice speedy little system
I think the best things are gonna like
as far as speed or anything like that
performance or going to involve really
changing out a lot of the base level
components motherboard processor and
graphics cards so yeah I guess what I'm
saying is I wouldn't really touch
system much because it's wired in nicely
and everything and everything's kind of
like it's all it's all right about the
same performance level you know I would
want to invent I would want to start a
new project rather than ya taking this
system and upgrading it but since that
system does or since that case does have
a side panel window if you were just
money to do the bare minimum of
aesthetics and this just occurred to me
now since you've already got a white
graphics card more or less than a blue
motherboard or a blue accented
motherboard maybe just get rid of that
knocked to a fan put it in a different
system use it for a different
application and replace it with a fan
that has like blue and white accents I
think that would tie a lot of that
together right they disagree what how
dare you have a different opinion than
me I mean from the core from the core
principles of pit my PC okay share what
you're saying makes sense but assigns
Mugen with a Noctua fan is a really good
performing cooler like this probably
keeps this I bet this has really good
temperatures yeah I'm sure sides makes
some really good air coolers with some
like solid and only providing my design
and superficial you know thoughts we
need both of ours to write but thank you
to nob 1l or whatever your Twitter name
is that I didn't catch Christian ray is
is next okay 1:20 on Twitter 6700 K
based system with a fury X and MSI
gaming pro motherboard G Skyrim and a
Corsair 400 C case that's the same
motherboard that I have in the stream
streaming PC that we use for awesome
hardware at my house this is one of the
first systems I've seen that's an actual
person system that has one of these
newer motherboards with the LED strip
that goes up the side with the PCB
that's kind of a slightly different
color so it can shine through
I was always torn when I saw those yeah
me too because it's yellow because yeah
it's kind of yellowish but I mean it's
it's hard to say you're like this
picture is taken with the flash and you
can't see a whole lot of layer there
that's so here's what it really looks
like
yeah Knight it's fun so they think I'm
lazy it's made it's made to live in a
darkness and yes to come out at night
exist chef
the blood of innocents innocent and that
kind of thing all right this is a cool
look I like the way it looks when it
when the lights are out because you have
the trace lighting on the motherboard
you have the Radeon shining proudly
there with the red which blends them
with everything else
your corsair and your msi light logos
here as well I would say maybe adding a
second LED fan to the to the bottom here
would maybe I don't know what do you
yeah cuz I think just the mismatch that
depends the difference actually when
they're on the same radiator I always
like to have the same fans on on a
single radiate just looks a bit more
even things out a little bit maybe even
on the the radiator for the the fury X
there too or is that a fury
yes fury X cuz it's got that there's not
much you can do about the cabling here
for the fury X it is as long as it
needed to be to be compatible with as
many cases as possible yeah
so I don't know I mean your your routing
here of the cables is you know it's not
the most aesthetically appealing it's a
little awkward but there's nothing you
can do about those because they are
units that are all in one sitting right
and there's nothing you can do so there
you go other than that your cable
management is great you know many one
thing he could do Paul is is maybe like
zip tie or maybe put a velcro strap
around the like both sides like both
basically clamp your cables down for
coming off your fury X give it the
clamps it's kind of making like a big
ceej like a backward C shape there if
you could just clamp that C down you
know like a velcro strap or like a zip
tie it might like from here to here yeah
like just straight from here it straight
up and just kind of like clamp it down a
little bit maybe even use two of them to
flatten it out a little feel like if it
did that and this was still going
straight it would conflict with the fans
it's hard to tell what the perspective
of the camera I don't know exactly how
close it is to the fan so yeah that
might interfere but something to check
out if you if you wanted to get in the
way of your CPU and stuff I think it
looks quite nice I think I think the
main things holding you back or
limitations of the all-in-one liquid
coolers that you have but there's really
nothing that can be done about that and
you've done a great job otherwise so
yeah there you go
you Christian next up we've got Todd and
he this is actually there's not much to
pimp here I would say he's got a pretty
killer systems could have been an
honorable mention here it's pretty sweet
this is from the mods ooh this is from
the mods you yes this is a custom
scratch build that he has put together
with very much kind of a Green Bay
Packers vibe I do see like a team helmet
the background there this is a pretty
nice little system here it's looks like
the ud5 you dh5 from gigabyte that
motherboard that had the gold accents on
it okay um
didn't get too much pop popularity but I
thought it was a pretty sweet board also
I like we don't the avexir Raiden Ram
you've completely spray-painted that or
colorized oh cool looks really nice
change the housing and it's the green
LED of XE Raiden rip yeah which is hard
to come back yeah this and the tubing
looks pretty sweet I think I believe
that's hardline to me like I like these
really like these fan and grills grills
those are really cool bear grylls you
know I wonder if those must be a Fed
those must be 3d printed or something
yeah I've never seen anything like that
mmm retail um pardon me Todd
posted his mods ooh link in here where
I'm sure if it's a good mod suit post
which I have to imagine this would be
will probably have a lot more details on
what he did as far as the construction
of this so if you guys are looking at
this in your Astrid yeah Kyle has the
link to the Twitter post in the
description of this video
then in there it has the link to the mod
zoo host very nice that's really cool I
like that build the trash builds are so
cool because they're just like you can
just do whatever yeah whatever you want
and they're completely unique so thank
you very much shot next we've got Carl
Barks at shadow byte on twitter which is
in an h h RF sorry s340 not the elite I
don't believe NZXT got a cry or a cooler
on there looks like some lpx memory from
Corsair little profile stuff yep
that's probably either a GTX don't know
it could be anything and then yeah it
could be a yeah I'm not sure but this
looks like a pretty modern system so
yeah I'm guessing it's a 900 series or
perhaps it's a thousand series rich
gigabyte card what's kind of weird for
so strange to me is the the PCIe cables
how ones black and ones white I think
you must have done that purposely with
extensions yeah I would assume so I kind
of like that you'd like the kind of
alternating I don't know I mean this is
a very black-and-white build and yeah I
mean barring getting custom extensions
or something like that or I just I just
feel like I my eyes miss the black cable
don't see the black right well because
it's in the shadows ninja yeah I I don't
have anything to say as far as
suggestions for upgrading the aesthetics
here apart from maybe cable combs for
these eight pins for your CPU that's
about all I'd have to say and this is
the only picture I think that's sent so
oh it's a 980ti g1 gaming and i 545 90
or cry rig age 7z 97's SLI crate and
eight gigs of Corsair Vengeance LP
memory nice build I like it yeah very
very nice
could you up Carl Isaac Schultz is next
the blue waited are there for testing
stuff not permanent okay
6700 K 916 looks like a GTX 960 is there
yes we've got one gig 960 ram 256 gig OC
z end up to one terabyte SSD and you
know that hyper 212 Evo lifestyle right
there um so I'd say this is probably
like the weakest that I've seen today
for as far as cable management coast
certainly I think the SSD that's hanging
on your power supply shroud there she'd
probably have some kind of housing
that's a bit more stable be like he was
indicating that that might be temporary
but okay if that is temporary good the
blue waited are there for testing stuff
this awaited it's gotta be some
autocorrect but there's a blue SATA
cable here plugged into an optical drive
which is obviously not a temporary
solution there's also a backplane on
this case this is a Coolermaster case I
don't know which one Evo it's a half X
okay well well I think your your system
definitely needs a RiRi hall or a revamp
of its cable management I would just at
this point I would just clear it all out
like take all the cables unplug them and
then that will also give you done
doesn't plug them and then remove this
power supply and replace it with a good
power supply because this is an L I
don't ok Liz made maybe this is an okay
power supply but it doesn't look like
one to me based on the label on the side
a shoddy cabling LSP 700 watt ATX I
can't read the power chart there but
80-plus concerning I've never heard of
LSP before and 80 plus I mean yeah may
if it's not 80 plus a power I get an
updated power supply with some
better-looking cables would be a very
good solution for doing that and then
you know SATA cables are really cheap
you know I can get it for like 50 cents
each
I'll you bear something just by some
black SATA cables that blend everything
else in and then do some cable
management and you have a nice-looking
system yeah that's what that's my stance
a mess you know I shouldn't tell anyone
to clean anything out of their systems
because my because the recent video I
posted just shows hotline old there's
dusty and nasty yeah yeah arctic Panther
is actually pretty dusty right now it's
yeah all right Zach pies I use ice 4470
ka7 at GTX 780 I'm guessing issues
formula formula z87 so Maximus thinks my
formula 32 gigs of G scale ramp see
sonic 650 watt power supply and an 850
Pro see this is what I was talking out
there not to a fan like if you had a
whole gang of them it can look fine
right yeah it's a theme right and it
actually looks pretty nice here I'm sure
you're getting some really nice temps on
that CPU as well there's honestly not
too much I could say about this system
other than if you wanted to get some
sleep extensions even though those are
black I mean they're already like
matched quite nicely with the rest of
its it blends in your cable management
is good you're taking advantage of all
the correct grommets that you should be
that it looks like you know there's
nothing sticking out no no everything
looks good to me it looks a little dusty
you can clean it and if you really
wanted to maybe get some extensions I
agree that's about it though good
assessment Kyle yep
okay that's off to put my pcs over and
then we got our last segment which is
face off that window oh we got a small
sponsor spot yes brothers yes today's
sponsor is fractal design where did that
go yes
yes they are good old fractal and I just
checked my email and was like why isn't
anyone bought anything from my story
it's because I archived everything I
archived all my what Commerce orders I
filtered it because I was getting too
many like Squarespace emails like you
know the new order you have a new order
that's annoying finding that likes like
hey somebody has supported your
challenge you no Lisa why can you
make me happy work more efficiently
hey they get their own inbox alright ok
they're special there we go fractal
design it's a sponsor for this week's
show
yeah we'd like an fractal josh is in
chat how does he know to show up right
as we are doing the sponsor spot I know
he's a lurker he just don't know just
lurks until he her half season the word
for Apple he's watching us very closely
to make sure that we're doing a good job
and saying only good things about
fractal design I'm just waiting for like
the pizza to show up yeah Pizza sure
would they would share what suck if a
pizza showed up where's the pizza today
Josh anyway point being I have a new
fractal define mini C and I built from
the system in it and I was gonna have it
right here like be like Lois system but
it's out and it's my HTTP C and it's
probably recording
I don't know house hunters are some
stuff that my wife likes to watch but
the point is it's great if I'm in DC is
great for recording time I had mini see
the fine C is also available in the
full-size as well as here it is there it
is right there hey so check out the
define C it's a new design it has a as a
power supply shroud it does she's nice
the first of its kind has they the very
you know distinguished look that the
fractal cases are known for minimalist
Scandinavian design and I thought it was
pretty good case I'll overall if you
guys want to check out a little bit more
and watch the videos linked in the
description well
at least on my channel I don't know if
Kyle's done this on his I did I linked I
linked the link not to my review but of
the product page on fractal okay on
fractals website okay and I have both
done our views of this case the defined
mini see so so go ahead and check those
out and you can see a bit more of our
feedback and and the builds that we did
in them because we both did builds in
them we did my build looked better
mine's a z77 build you dick see 77
that's old-school like an old-school
classic yeah had a 35 70 K in that bad
boy nice had to take it out of the HTTP
see wifey sauce wasn't happy about that
wait so what did did you so is this now
your htpc - no I just did it for the
video did you move it back because the
z77 board it was the only micro ATX port
I had okay was yeah it's you should put
a micro ATX board in on my grades yes
you shouldn't yeah
and then the 35 70 K was the only 1155
chip that I had okay yeah back into the
other case now yeah it's all it's all
restored back to normal okay
htpc has been restored but I will say
cuz I mean I moved my name is from a
node 804 to the define mini C but it
stayed that way afterwards right that
while uptick because I mean it's quieter
it's yeah the node 804 had been in
service for a while and then gotten
quite dusty for me it's just a space
thing our HD PC is the size of like a
toaster it's like this big oh yeah it
goes underneath our entertainment center
stone face but yeah go ahead and check
all that out links in the description
below for either of our YouTube channels
you can find more information on the
defined mini see right there including
our reviews and stuff but let's go ahead
and move on to our next segment which is
face off now we can do face off which is
a segment where Paul and I go
head-to-head it and mean to do that in
an online what's happening I changed I
changed the lower thirds and we can't
take you anywhere Paul hey i parently
changed them both that was weird
Oh where's face-off haze under F yeah
they should be there it's right there
face up a okay now now we can do face
off all right so basically this is an
online two-player flash game it's a
really shitty game that Paul and I
usually play and one of us wins and the
other one loses and the loser
usually it's Kyle because he has
practiced 29 I mean no tell me not today
I saw you I was like oh we have a very
living I have to test the games how many
times drivers Davis I have to test the
games to make sure that they actually
work because some of the games you
should grab that keyboard because when
they're when they're just when they're
free and they're like online flash game
some of them just don't work like you'll
press the buttons they don't work it was
just like I had
we need a cable I'm gonna buy you the
board for Christmas
why cuz it's it'll be a gift to me as
well these keyboard face offs are just
fine but I mean a wireless keyboard for
face off just her face off
okay would be really nice get one of
those really thin I have a really thin
Logitech one I could just bring it over
but this is why I like keyboards that
have a USB pass-through so I can do
stuff like this oh okay
what ruin the entire stream press like
f11 f12 over bring it oh no
why are you gonna get you're gonna go
coding right now yeah I'm gonna code and
recode the out of this website at
coding this stuff I need to see the
source code alright so on the game that
we have set up today is flappy bread
we've lost another LED really yeah wow
that's
S&amp;amp;H if no died and I what eyes going oh
and I what yeah oh and one what LEDs
used are frying off of this thing this
is a lot there's a lot of LEDs have died
up has never had an LED diode yeah it
happens
fortunately the keys still work when you
press them it's why this is episode of
Awesome hundra's not sponsored by Cooler
Master
certainly not um all right so I guess we
can go on to our game which is flabby
birdies it's kind of like I guess when
flappy bird was around someone just made
this as a knockoff
it's basically flappy bird that really
annoying app game yeah that got way too
much pop you never actually played um
I've only played in this form before
maybe once on the phone but I
immediately hated it and never played
again so we both died but what what just
happened I think oh no you can go to
retry so mine is I have space I have I
know I know wait one of them space and
you have up or space or mouse and then
the other person has you so you do up
arrow
you do the up arrow I'll do you space
okay all right so I'll be alright we can
ready yes
go so I'm right I'm blue so the idea is
fall and not looks like I'm winning
 tree stumps alright yeah you
know one so let's go first to ten first
to 1000 okay honey
oh it's quick though Krista five five
wins best out of seven
the first wonderful way first of four
yeah so I'm already up one starting now
god dammit that was a practice run just
make sure that everything was working I
was like a test boot Paul boys she can't
call it a build to build complete on the
test boot alright first of four don't
worry I'm really bad at this obviously
you have like the temperaments and the
control that I do not so I should just
die because alright come practice
practice in here no all right oh my god
that's three nothing
nothing nobody heard the last two or
three sentences we said because I turned
the volume dead because ah sorry sorry
about the parking alright well that was
what we call a sweeping the series I
believe yeah it was pretty bad alright
good job Paul but I'm gonna have to pay
the consequences because after every
faceoff is a punishment that the loser
has to arable punishments so the
punishments that I've concocted for
myself apparently today is that for for
your half of the show yes from I have
your half of the show since my half is
pretty much over I'm gonna have to
finish any beer alcohol or anything that
I drink from here on out is gonna have
to be drank out of this tiny mason jar
that's a very small mason jar very tiny
maybe a shot or a shot and a half worth
it yeah probably an ounce ounce and a
half perhaps
so um I guess I'll just kick things off
but I don't want to pour it over here
cuz it's probably gonna get messy okay
I'll do I'll dunk it dunk it like this
use a wired make a little dunk for you
yeah you know attach a wire to it all
right
bottoms up cheers Cheers hey excuse you
guys doing the view shot feel so much
more badass drinking out of a shot glass
oh yeah I'm ready for another one I'm
ready for another one it's like yeah
it's like 5% beer bro all right shall we
do some Johnson shoutouts yes we shall
yes okay let's do this yes it is Asian
sighs correct all right starting with
a six seven five three oh now that's
good this guy in here Gavin Gavin thank
you very much for picking up a bio
slasher shirt thanks Gavin oh no I
didn't I just okay well as Navin Johnson
wait Nick
Nakia Nakia Armour you're only supposed
to say the first name they'll never know
how that's spelled okay but I won't do
their armor it's very cool name I had to
share it with the world so cool name CPU
cooler thank you very much for picking
up a hoodie actually a CPU cooler hoody
appreciate that you'll probably be warm
in it I don't even have one of those
jealous and then just one more here
Mitchell
thank you very much Mitchell Johnson for
you sir for picking up a bit wit logo
shirt the video the hoodie you got the
hoodie yeah awesome thank you
and the stay positive shirt as well
thank you very much sir oh we got to
mention this by the way can we mention
that really quick right you mention it
now she's mention now so um we just
we're in talks with our t-shirt guy who
handles all of our merchandise and he
has just initiated some coupon deals on
both of our stores which means you can
get 10% off starting now effective now
10% off our merchandise if you spend $50
or more or you can get 20% off if you
spend $100 or more which that's like you
know if you bought like a couple shirts
in a hoodie or maybe some pint glasses
and you know some some polo shirts from
Paul store whatever it is a couple
decals you can easily take advantage of
those discounts it is listed on both of
our websites I believe according to our
t-shirt guy so if you go there oh my god
what's happening here
all right skips a beat every time so uh
feel free to check out those deals it's
that time of year y'all where Caesar
seasonal discounts and stuff are running
amok so oh yeah go ahead check it out

guys you'll see the deals and stuff on
my homepage but yeah they cool they will
work allegedly so that's all for my half
of the show guys don't go anywhere
because we are gonna continue with
Paul's half if you're watching us on
YouTube right now you can go ahead and
head over to his channel Paul's hardware
if that's too difficult then you can
there's a link that I put in my
description that'll take you right there
if you're on Twitch just stay where you
are we're not going anywhere we probably
will even cut we'll probably just you
know pee right in front of you that
should have been the punishment for face
off ok so thank you guys
