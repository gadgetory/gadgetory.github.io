to learn more
what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel today I'm pretty excited because
we're gonna be taking a look and
upgrading my original my very first HP
PC or home theater PC that I built five
years ago back in 2013
since then it's had a couple upgrades
along the way about two years ago I
upgraded the GPU and the storage and
we'll talk about that a little bit later
but what happened a couple months ago
was that I actually built a second home
theater PC that was very high-end you
guys can go ahead and check out that
two-part series when you have a chance
it's pretty insane so I really didn't
have any need for a second HT PC at that
point and since then this has kind of
just been collecting dust in my old
office back at home so I decided that
for this video I would go about actually
upgrading this from old HP PC to
mid-range at 1080p gaming system I don't
really have a need for a gaming PC
immediately but it's nice to have
something small form-factor let's say
we're doing stack attack in the future
it's kind of cool to have something like
this just ready to go at a moment's
notice and I'm also a huge small
form-factor enthusiast if you guys
didn't already know that so this sort of
thing really gets me going let's first
talk about the specs that we're rocking
here so we can kind of see where we're
coming from first off we've got the core
i5 35 70 K that's an Ivy Bridge quad
core processor that is the original
processor that I used when building this
system back in the day it's currently
clocked at 4.3 gigahertz at 1.21 volts
and that's with the help of an as rock
as e77 EEI TX motherboard it's got
built-in Wi-Fi which is great plenty of
USB 3 on the back for an older
generation board and that's gonna be
paired with an 8 gigabyte kit of AMD
Radeon ddr3 at 2400 speeds actually
pretty fast for a kit of its time but
eight gigs is also kind of
if you're gonna be playing modern
triple-a titles and especially if you're
gonna be multitasking alongside that so
we are gonna be upgrading that memory
kit to this 16 gigabyte kit a vengeance
LP nan X this is ddr3 this is before the
X came around just a standard low
profile it's still got the green PCBs
and all that now we are taking a slight
speed hit here going from 2400 to 1866
however I'm okay with that because it's
not going to affect our gaming
performance much compared to what we
might incur if we had too little ram in
our gaming system so very excited to be
swapping that out today oh I completely
overlooked the CPU cooler that we're
using is actually a Samuel 17 from
prolimatech I don't think they make it
anymore I correct me if I'm wrong but
it's a fantastic low-profile cooler I
actually swapped out to be a stock fan
for a gelid 120 which are super quiet
and very economical fans that's been
doing a great job we'll be comparing
comparing thermals a bit after we
rebuild the system with all the upgraded
parts
I'm keeping the the cooler though
because it's just a fantastic cooler
it looks awesome as well now the
original graphics card was the EVGA GTX
650 Ti boost which I later made a slight
upgrade to with a gigabyte gtx 750ti
and then two years ago I swapped that
out yet again for a sapphire compact r9
285 which is what's in here today but
that's also starting to show its signs
of age especially if we're gonna try to
do some 1080p gaming at max settings and
things like that so we're gonna be
swapping that it as well for an EVGA
Super clock gtx 1066 gigabyte model and
this is gonna be a fantastic card
because it is for one sort of a small
form-factor card its mini it's less than
eight inches long on the PCB
additionally it only needs a single 6
pin power connector and it should
theoretically have a bit more
overclocking Headroom as well even
though it is already factory overclocked
now I could have gone with the gtx 1070
or something a little bit more
higher-end because believe it or not if
you overclocked that 35 70 K it is still
very capable gaming CPU and it could
definitely handle a gtx 1070 but we
still have the original 450 watt sfx
power supply from silverstone this is
one of the more
Premium ones at the time that has
modular cables and it's 80 plus gold but
at 450 watts I didn't want to push it I
definitely want to overclock I mean
obviously we're already overclocking the
CPU and if we're overclocking the GPU -
I didn't want to push it with a gtx 1070
my phone's going up subtle kirk i don't
know who this is but anyways the point
is that i think this is gonna make a
fantastic upgrade for the system at hand
and again i appreciate just how small it
is it's gonna fit right into our sg0 5
from silverstone here now finally for
storage I've been booting off of a 256
gig Plextor m5 Pro which is just a
standard two and a half inch SATA Drive
and that's been paired with a 480 gig
crucial M SATA Drive because this board
actually the motherboard actually has an
M se to slot on it that's been used for
all of our games we didn't really need
much storage because it was just a
livingroom PC but now that we're going
full-blown gaming system we're actually
gonna take out the Plextor drive and
boot off of the crucial instead and then
place a one terabyte WD black inside of
this thing just for all of our games
because we are gonna need a bit more
storage now if this is a dedicated
gaming rig so that should be super fun
hopefully we can boot off of that M
stated drive no problem I don't think
it'll give us any issues we'll see so
that's pretty much it oh and then
there's an LG blu-ray reader writer that
I never use right here it's a slim
optical drive on that note I think I
pretty much covered everything for the
system and where we're headed with the
upgrades I think at this point we can
just start taking this apart I'm
actually gonna disassemble the entire
thing so we can do a proper cleaning
because it is dusty as hell once we've
done that so we can go ahead and start
putting it back together with the
existing parts that we're reusing and
all of our upgraded hardware so should
be pretty cool let's go ahead and get
started on that
alright guys so here it is honestly I
got to say she looks pretty good I spent
a lot of time with cable management and
just dusting the individual parts this
time around so she looks brand-new
practically and I think even more
impressive than that is the sort of
performance gains that we're seeing from
swapping out that r9 285 with this gtx
1066 figa byte model we actually ran a
unit in heaven 4.0 with the old system
we were getting a score of 870 and an
average frame rate of 34 FPS with this
new graphics card we actually saw an
uplift of over 90% so we actually got a
score of 16 hundred and seventy and an
average frame rate of 66 even crazier
though is that we actually dropped temps
on our 35 70k by simply cleaning out the
CPU cooler and reapplying some thermal
interface material we actually went from
73 degrees Celsius max on the package
down to 66 C so a seven degree
difference simply by reapplying thermal
paste and and cleaning the cooler so
make sure you guys are doing regular
cleans on your systems guys it really
does make a difference and then
additionally I did run 3d 3d mark
firestrike not extreme just regular
firestrike and got a point difference
from the old system I think we went from
70 100 on the overall score to 10,000
400 the graphics score initially was
8400 and that went soaring to 13,000 and
400 points
once we slot it in the GTX 1060 here so
overall some really impressive gains I'm
super happy with how this turned out if
you guys have any ideas on what you'd
like me to do with this rig for another
