a computer case yeah it's the define us
from fractal design they run so quietly
I figured I'd put it there as a reminder
that in this crazy hectic world
silence really is golden is that the
same computer case yeah
the finance supports triple radiators
water cooling pumps and reservoirs so I
figured I'd put one there just to remind
myself to be flexible in life really in
the bathroom why well yeah I figured the
toilet hasn't been working lately and
the define us has such a spacious
interior that I just thought the define

uncompromised custom water cooling

the description for more info what's up
guys today I'm gonna be reviewing a
brand spanking new video card from AMD's
300 series that just launched earlier
this week this is the power color r9
390x successor to AMD's former flagship
the r9 290x by now you're probably aware
that the 300 series consists of all
rebranded GPUs that we've seen in
previous generations and while many of
us may be reserving more excitement for
AMD's very soon to be released fury
cards with their fancy new Fiji chips
and HBM technology there may still be
some rationale for picking up a 300
series cards for starters r9 300 card
owners will benefit from full DirectX 12
support and AMD's newest technologies
like virtual super resolution liquid VR
and of course free sync AMD is also
claiming the r9 390 and 390 X to be
equipped for 4k gaming a bold statement
that will verify with some benchmarks
later on taking a closer look at our
390x the card uses an enhanced version
of the Hawaii XT GPU found on the 290 X
so yes we do get the same 28 nanometer
GCN 1.1 r
and the same number of 2,816 stream
processing units though a big memory
clock boost over the 290x is a nice
surprise jumping from 5 to 6 gigabits
per second a 20% increase that yields an
impressive memory bandwidth of 384
gigabytes per second that should serve
nicely with the 8 2 gigs of gddr5 on the
512 bit bus the new baseline frame
buffer for the 390 and 390 X whereas the
290x came stocked with 4 gigs of memory
using 2 2 gig chips AMD has stepped up
their game to using to-four gig chips
which not only grants the obvious
benefit of more capacity but higher
clock speeds at lower voltages don't
expect any power savings though as the
card still carries a hefty 275 watt TDP
in true AMD fashioned core clock speed
also gets a boost over the 290 X but a
minor one at that
at 5% bumping it up to 1050 megahertz
power color has given their 390x a
slight factory overclock to 1060
megahertz speaking of which I'm supposed
to be reviewing this card so now that
you're a bit more familiar with some of
the more notable changes surrounding the
300 series there is still much to say
about power colours take on AMD's
short-lived flagship this card is
sporting a beefy 11 and a half inch
cooler that incorporates a traditional
dual slot design but don't be fooled
with a large width of 2 inches this
particular 390x occupies the space of a
3 slot card effectively blocking the
slot to spaces beneath it fortunately
most ATX boards have their highest speed
PCIe slots more than two spaces apart
but this is something to bear in mind if
you plan on having several PCI connected
cards as cumbersome as it may be this is
an absolutely gorgeous cooler loosely
enclosed by a textured steel frame with
striking silver plastic accents power
colour has done a bang-up job with the
build quality here as everything from
the shroud to the 380 mm eater fans feel
top-notch as we're starting to see on
more and more video cards these days the
fans here keep at 0 rpm when idling only
spinning up when the GPU temporize --is
above 60 degrees Celsius a simple yet
effective feature for power saving and
dead silent operation with low impact
usage beneath the blades is a Monstress
nickel plated aluminum heatsink that
spans the entire length of the PCB and
then some
also included is an all copper GPU block
for effective heat dissipation along
with three six millimeter heat pipes and
one eight millimeter pipe on the front
side we get some power color branding
that's just the right amount of shiny
and power ports for one eight pin and
one 6 pin PCI II connector flipping
around to the back we see power color
has mounted a beautiful metallic
backplate to the PCB for added rigidity
and straight-up sex appeal
tasteful ventilation cutouts and an
attractive brushed finish make this
another perfect example of the card's
outstanding craftsmanship finally on the
back we get two dual link DVI HDMI 2.0
and DisplayPort 1.2 video outputs as I
hinted earlier I did run some benchmarks
on this card at 1080 1440 and most
importantly 4k to see if AMD's claims of
4k ready gaming are actually true
unlocking the cards potential I was
quickly able to boost the core clock
speed to eleven hundred and twenty five
megahertz with no problems
meaning you get about the same relative
overclocking potential as the 290x even
leaving the memory clock speed at stock
I couldn't take the GPU any further
which might indicate that we're now
reaching near 100% of the Hawaii XTS
full potential throughout my testing the
cards cooler to define job at keeping
temps below sixty nine degrees Celsius
though at the cost of noticeable fan
noise in might define our five naturally
wearing a pair of cans or even running
the game audio through a pair of
speakers at low volume drowns out the
sound entirely still by creating a
custom fan curve in MSI Afterburner
I was able to create a silent gaming
experience at 60% fan speed which raised
the GPU temp slightly to a still
comfortable 76 degrees Celsius and in
case you were wondering all tests were
run in my x99 5820k system on Windows
8.1 all right tearing through this video
I love it on that note ladies and
gentlemen without further ado here are
the benchmarks
so class what did we learn well if
you're familiar with the performance of
the 290x you can see that this card does
in fact outperform it albeit by a
relatively smaller margin still beating
out its predecessor puts the 390x in the
ring with invidious gtx 980 and though I
don't have a 980 on hand to test myself
the numbers I've seen in the past lead
me to believe that these two cards would
be trading blows in the majority of
today's games the reason this matters is
because the r9 390x is retailing for 429
USD at the time of its launch or about
70 bucks cheaper than the GTX 980 I
suppose my point in all of this is that
regardless of how ordinary or
uninspiring these r9 300 series cards
may be they're still on par with their
team green counterparts but at a far
lower price point which perhaps is
exactly the angle AMD intended to play
now circling back to the prospect of 4k
gaming well we didn't exactly live up to
that one did we I mean even though I ran
all my tests with anti-aliasing it's
unlikely that the frame rates gained
from disabling that filter would satisfy
the common enthusiast gamer who spends
$400 plus on a graphics card for K ready
GP you still have a long way to go until
they can consistently hit those smooth
frame rates were used to at lower
resolutions now that being said the 390x
is a great option for quad HD gaming as
we saw it hit 60 FPS in most of today's
tests as for the card in question I'm
really impressed by power colours
rendition of the 390x this is easily one
of the most solidly built cards I've
seen and while it's easily confused with
a large cement brick it's a pretty brick
and I'd happily build my next house with
a thousand of them if I could after all
it'd be ashamed not to utilize the
structural integrity of that backplate
the cooler itself does its job well and
does so quietly if you're willing to do
some quick fan tuning overall this is a
beautifully crafted card that'll make
most gamers happy assuming you have the
room for it but let me know what you
