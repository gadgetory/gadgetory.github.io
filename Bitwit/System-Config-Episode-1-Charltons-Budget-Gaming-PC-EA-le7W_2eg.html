awesomesauce news welcome to the world
premiere of system-config now as many of
you know I posted a video a couple weeks
ago explaining the general concept of
the show but for those of you who missed
it
well basically each episode follows one
individual in need a new computer system
and whether that computer be a high-end
gaming rig or budget htpc the
possibilities are really endless at the
end of the day the goal of each episode
is to build a computer specific to the
client's needs desired level of
functionality and their budget and also
as many of you know I've kind of been
working on the concept of this show for
the last several weeks now so after much
planning and preparation I'm finally
ready to see it go from concept to
reality so without further ado I'm
incredibly excited to present to you all
the first of hopefully many episodes of
system-config
and joy hi my name is Charlton I'm from
Anaheim California and I'm looking to
build a budget gaming PC so aside from
daily use with internet browsing and
word processing with schoolwork I'm
looking to play some games such as
Starcraft 2 Diablo 3 the expansion when
it comes out and also BioShock Infinite
so I built my current system back in
2008 because I wanted to play some of
the games back then but right now I'm
running Core 2 Duo
with 2 gigabytes of RAM and 512
megabytes and graphics so I can't really
keep up with the games of today my
budget for this PC is around $700 but
hopefully with the new sales coming up
with Black Friday and Cyber Monday I'll
be able to get some good deals so
basically with this new PC I'm hoping to
have a smooth gaming experience and not
have to sacrifice too much in terms of
graphics and playability so hopefully
kyle has a system-config will be able to
help me out with that all right guys so
I've brought Charlton over into my
humble abode and I told him to bring
along his old desktop so we can take a
look at it and just see how badly
Charlton needs an upgrade right about
now so this is a cooler master chassis
am i right yeah it looks like they looks
like a pretty decent chassis looks like
it was a pretty good case for its time
yeah she served me well you kept it in
pretty good shape I believe this thing
opens up very nice it's got a business
an LED yep blue LEDs here
and it's uh it's a hundred 20 millimeter
yeah man you got DVD drive very nice a
lot of a lot of nice ventilation here
but I'm sure it probably gets a lot of
dust in there it's probably a vacuum for
Dustin I feel see so why don't we take a
look inside and just see exactly the
damage that has been done over the last
one five years that you've had this guy
oh my goodness that is impressive that
is most impressive sir okay so first off
I'll be teaching you what a twist
highest or as at time so you can manage
some of these cables a bit better but
that is that is impressive how much dust
buildup you've accumulated over the over
the years let's see first off you've got
a Core 2 Duo CPU in there with a stock
Intel CPU cooler and it looks like the
heatsink can no longer breathe due to
the insane amount of dust buildup you've
also got two six memory that's too big
so you got one you got two one gig
modules and those are those are the nice
side gold-plated ocz modules aren't that
yep and I believe those are ddr2 right
you like 800 speed or something like
that this is really good stuff a bit you
got an 8-bit motherboard and then we've
also got what video card is it seriously
that's a Radeon HD 2600 8 xt nice very
nice 512 megabytes awesome looks like
you have an aftermarket cooler on it
Exelero
yeah the video covers give me a lot of
heating problems I wanted to slap on an
aftermarket cooler nice yes it wasn't
ever there and it ever just like shut
down on you from Overtown definitely
yeah brutal there's a ton of ton of
molex here we've got an IDE cable this
is this is legacy status guys this is
legendary and you've also got a hard
drive what's the capacity of the hard
drive that's 320 gigs 320 games that's
not been so trash the rest of it keep
the hard drive I think we're going to be
ok you got a 500 watt power spike top
mounted of course but before I get an
allergy attack why don't we um why don't
we set this thing up and just kind of
try to run some applications on it see
how see how far we can get sure let's do
it do it alright guys so we have
Charlton's desktop all set up right here
and I guess the first thing to do is to
boot it up and keep in mind of this is a
believe it 7200 rpm mechanical hard
drive so it's going to be a bit slow
plus it's 5 or 6 years old but let's
just let's just roll roll tape right now
I've got a stopwatch right here we're
going to time it ready let's do it let's
do it
three two one go Oh hear anything let's
try that again let's try it one more
time wait let me stop it okay clearly
need a new computer because this one
doesn't turn on all right one two three
go all right I think I hear a hair fans
it's booting I like these on Wow all
right it really wants to know that means
every one of these means you got a hit
preset yeah what oh no that's that's not
good is that now it's happening often
every once in a while oh wow okay all
right guys so we finally got it to boot
on as soon as we stopped recording
actually the computer boot on no problem
I know it sounds like a lie but it's
totally true so we're in the OS right
now we're in Windows XP and why don't we
just do a quick little test here we have
left 4 dead 2 right here and I hear this
was one of your favorite games back in
the day I used to play this a lot but I
had to crank it down all the way on low
settings in order to be able to barely
run it okay so why don't we I think we
already have it to like to play at high
settings we didn't even max it out
though I think we have MSAA and
anisotropic filtering at 4x so why don't
we give it a go for the camera and just
show them exactly what we'd be looking
at what our user experience would be
playing at these settings all right so
here's just an opening cinematic choppy
I don't think I really need to go
further than that so ok I think I think
actually will kill a zombie you have to
kill a zombie first we need to see what
killing a zombie looks like in five
frames Wow look at the skull shatter in
slow motion I've made flip books that
move faster than that that's insane
well that said why don't we switch gears
here and take a look at the actual
components that you will be using from
now on that hopefully won't give you
performance like this that we've
experienced here today so you ready to
do that yeah let's take a look all right
let's do it
all right guys so for a budget gaming PC
in today's day and age you really can't
go wrong with a visera series CPU from
AMD this is the AMD FX 6300 and it comes
clock 3.5 gigahertz out of the box with
the turbo boost a four point one it's a
six core processor for a hundred and
twenty bucks and it's quite a steal for
any budget gamer the motherboard we've
chosen is MSI's 970 ag 43 so it's got
the AMD 970 chipset it's am3+ socket for
that
FX 6300 CPU and it's got enough USB 3.0
and SATA 6 gigabits per second
connectivity for all Charlton's needs
it also supports up to 32 gigs of ddr3
so if Charlton wants to upgrade in the
future he can easily do so
speaking of RAM we decided to go with an
Ares series kit from g.skill this is
their 8 gigabyte kit at 1600 so we've
got 2 4 gig modules and they've even got
nice little shiny blue heatsink Soloman
which will match really nicely with that
MSI motherboard the video card we chose
was the hias Radeon HD 7870 gigahertz
Edition so it comes clocked at 1,000
megahertz right out of the box and it
also features 2 gigs of gddr5 memory on
a 256 bit interface which is going to be
great for 1080 gaming it also features a
chai SS Ice Cube custom cooler which has
huge copper heat pipes and a really nice
blower style design which actually
intakes air from both sides of the
blower style fan I also wanted to
mention that this card is PCIe gen3
point-o but the motherboard only
supports PCIe gen 2 which honestly
shouldn't be much of a problem as PCIe
gen 2 isn't even being saturated with
the current generation of video cards so
charlton won't really be seeing much of
a performance hit now i've assigned the
task of cooling our FX 6300 cpu to the
cooler master hyper 212 evo successors
to the tried-and-true hyper 212 plus
this offers an amazing price to
performance ratio is extremely quiet and
even while cooling on air should allow
for some Headroom for moderate
overclocking now with the dropping
prices and SSDs on the market right now
I figured it was still possible to get
one of these in Charlton's build even
for under $700 so here we have the
SanDisk Ultra plus 128 gig SSD features
a Marvell controller SATA Rev 3 and
we'll be installing the operating system
as well as some smaller applications
like Chrome in Microsoft Office just to
help Charlton speed up things with his
day-to-day tasks for games an all-around
media storage we've decided to go with
WD blue one terabyte drive at 7200 rpm
it's an incredibly reliable piece of
hardware that delivers solid performance
when you need it our power supply of
choice was NZXT a laity 2v2 this is
their 550 watt model and this might be
considered the white elephant in the
room pun totally intended just because
you could probably find a cheaper
modular power supply right now on the
market but due to Black Friday and Cyber
Monday deals we actually found a killer
deal on this unit so we decided to go
with it and it is fully modular and 80
plus bronze certified so it should have
plenty of power to drive the
here we have an ACS DVD combo drive and
it also comes with a green software
which helps you save over 50% power
consumption now obviously optical media
drives are not necessary these days but
they are super cheap and they're very
handy to use in certain situations for
instance if you're doing a clean install
of a computer and you don't yet have
your LAN drivers installed you can't get
onto the Internet it's very nice and
handy to have an optical drive nearby
that you just pop in a driver disk and
get your system up and running and last
but certainly not least is the chassis
that all this beautiful hardware will be
dwelling in this is the corsair Carbide
series 300 R it offers a great bang for
the buck with a painted interior 2 front
panel USB 3.0 and tons of mounting
points for fans and after charlton
shared his story about his old desktop
overheating and shutting down I figured
this was gonna be a good choice for him
considering it has a lot of good cooling
performance and is incredibly
budget-friendly
now the total cost of all these parts
comes out to 830 dollars but with my
guidance and Charlton's deal hunting
abilities during Black Friday and Cyber
Monday we were able to get everything
within his $700 budget making this an
outstanding PC for the price he paid for
it and now that we've hand-picked all
the parts for this budget gaming rig the
only thing left to do is build it
you
alright guys so the build is done I
think you went pretty smoothly
we got everything installed correctly
hopefully it booted on we installed
Windows 7 64 bits we've also installed
origin and battlefield 4 so why don't we
boot it on and test out the game see
just how much we can push the video card
that we just put in here that 7870 I'll
let you do the honors since it is your
system go ahead sir Leeroy boots oh it's
already a step ahead of the other that
is true and it's fairly quiet as well
yeah and I believe this will boot a lot
quicker than your your computer your old
computer as well gotta love that
solid-state we're there alright so we
are playing at high settings right now
in battlefield 4 that's the the
battlefield 4 preset for high and
everything's looking really smoothly
right now Charleston's having a much
easier time killing people than you were
in left 4 dead 2 frame rates are looking
pretty good as well we're hovering just
about 55 to 60 65 at times with a few
dips into the 40's the low 40s
occasionally we actually cranked it up
the ultra for a bit and there were some
moments where it would actually dip
below 30 so it wasn't exactly playable I
wouldn't call it comfortable or ideal
but it even then it's still obviously
way better than your old system to left
her dead too and honestly I think since
since I've officially lost Charlton on
all levels at this point I think it's a
good time to wrap up this this episode
of system config so thank you guys for
watching and being a part of this
experience I know I really enjoyed it
and hopefully charlton did - I think
eyes enjoy the video be sure to
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already be sure to give me a like and
