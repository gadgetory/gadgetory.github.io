down to breakfast right now the others
are waiting down there for me including
joy and logan paul and possibly j we've
got a $35 voucher for for breakfast so
i'm pretty pumped about that and then
we're going to go jump into all the
nvidia shenanigans whether that's a fun
activity or the actual editors day press
event which tablet happening later
pretty stoked yeah
III tttt jjjjj in the morning my 14 oh I

ketchup on it what the hell I'll eat
this happen are you doing oh you're
a better eater than I thought and you're
sneaking you just alright I'm back
though tell room whoo so after
breakfasts every the whole crew went off
to do nvidia activities like horseback
riding wine tasting and that sort of
thing i stayed behind me and paul stayed
behind because we're hungover as hell
crashed out for about three hours in our
respective rooms we didn't pollen I
didn't nap together despite what you
guys might think and then woke up had a
late lunch just me and him it's very
romantic and then now we are waiting
another half an hour until invidious
dinner starts and that's when all the
editors will be together in the same
space so until then I'm just sitting
around Paul's putting pants on has
nothing to do with our nap I swear he's
that in his room putting on pants cuz he
was wearing shorts earlier and I'm just
gonna start pregaming now cuz I do not
learn way it's awesome hardware like a
famous or something every what the
wedding campus at me
can associate extreme close that Thun
calls me why is here like this so
selling this with you there's a big
nvidia building this is the live stream
where they're gonna be announcing some
really juicy details about invidious
upcoming hardware super pumped oh here
we are we finally made it in pretty
swanky it's looking good looky look so
beautiful in this cut kind of light it
really brings out your eyes alright so
as usual Luke is macgyvering some
right now what what's even happening
right what is this so this is going to
be over facing streaming camera
webcam on the plane this is actually a
pretty good my car w by forward facing
camera and then I'm going to scream into
a nadir media capture HD which I don't
think they sell anymore if you look up
the model number for GL 310 you can buy
the drivers for it I'm going to try to
stream where this so that we can hang
out Mike James channel
talk about throwing shirts to my eyes no
I heard that there's a really great
technology these days called periscope
that maybe you should look into I get it
begin with the swanky jacket people's
way people have your announcements all
right look at this here this guy's GTX
tuning for the Epis oh yeah
look at that
ah morning after always a treat
we're supposed to be leaving really
early this morning people are already
lining up outside of 730am I hate
everything see how these pass holes are
doing did we got over here we've got a
wild elric Ferris over here so what
morning yeah starting the day off with
breakfast and V are quite possibly the
best combination I have ever no no no oh
it's Joanne I joined its Legolas J so
Jays worked really hard to lose a lot of
weight in the last year or so and I
think it's all it's all gonna go to
waste today we don't talk about the day
like this never happened like fried
chicken and a deep fried yeah what do
you intend is honey butter is that
literally I guess melted butter honey it
looks like some dudes honey butter
what's up guys so I'm here back in my
hotel room I just got back from the
video press conference that all the
stuff that they were talking about today
not the live stream he's still under
embargo to till till later on so I can't
talk about any of that but I did want to
briefly recap some of the things they
were highlighting and the stream last
night which was made publicly available
but really there's there's a lot of
stuff to cover so I'm really just going
to talk about the two things that
impressed me the most which were both
the high end graphics cards including
the GTX 1080 and the 1070 as well if you
guys want to get more information about
all the stuff all the things can go
ahead and check out Luke's video on
Linus tech tips or you can go watch
watch Paul's blog on Paul smartware but
it's just gonna be about the card so
we've got 1080 and also sorry my voice
is a little bit dead if you couldn't
tell the the GTX today is essentially
going to feature they didn't really say
it nvidia was kind of hush-hush about it
but i'm assuming it's going to be the GP
one at 104 actual died poor 16 nanometer
manufacturing process that is courtesy
of TSMC and I think what what really
impressed me a lot was the the actual
corn boost clock that we're seeing on
the GTX 1080 which is 1607 megahertz for
the base clock and then 1733 megahertz
important loose puck they actually had a
demo you did that they showed us on
stage that was running in 2.1 gigahertz
overclocked force additionally it was
only running at 67 degrees Celsius they
even like opened up the little HUD and
showed us that it was running running
pretty cool for that for over two
gigahertz in clock speed so that's very
impressive that also has a lot to do
with the the power efficiency it's
essentially twice as powerful was we've
got 180 watt TDP which is still higher
than the GTX 980 but Baron
this is going to be a much more much
more powerful and just all around faster
card in fact envious claiming that it's
going to be outperforming two gtx 980 s
in sli a single 1080 love performed 298
es más alleges insane and then it's
also going on top of that it's also
about 1p 8-pin he's getting connector so
really just sipping sipping off of the
electrical teach if you will now it
doesn't feature a gddr5 x memory it's
going to have eight gigs of that on a
256-bit bus and it's going to be
effectively 10 gigabits per second which
is a ludicrously fast and then lastly
it's arriving on May 27 I can say that
now it's going to be here in just a few
15 more weeks and the MSRP is going to
be 5 99 which is very competitively
priced and the founders edition which is
essentially the really angular Batmobile
looking shroud that everyone's been
talking about I believe that's the
founders edition that's going to be 699
so you're going to pay an extra hundred
dollar premium for that one and then
lastly this brief briefly talk about
Patek gcx 1070 which also sounds really
exciting they didn't really go to too
many details about this garden here 1080
so they left us in the dark about corn
boost clock we have no idea what that is
still going to assume it's a cut-down
version of the GP 104 and we it was
revealed that it's still going to
feature 8 gigabytes however that's going
to be gddr5 non X so you're not going to
get that that's going to be arriving
June tenth with an MSRP of 379 super
competitive and the founders edition for
just under 100 bucks more at 449 so
those are all the things I want to say
about those two cards really excited
looking forward to maybe getting it out
but being a sample in the near future
they makin nudge Nvidia and have them
send me to so I can just mess alive
stuff but that's all that's going to do
it for now guys thank you so much for
watching this little vlog / informative
educational moments that we just shared
but go ahead and toss me a like on the
video if you enjoyed it stay tuned for
more tech stuff coming really soon and
I'll see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
