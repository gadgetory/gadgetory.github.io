to you by be quiet cable mod verda gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info so I thought
I'd pop into the zotac booth not really
expecting a whole lot new because we're
not really anticipating many new GPU
launches except for maybe Vega but sure
enough they did not disappoint I was
pleasantly surprised to find this little
guy right here this is currently being
branded as the world's smallest GPX
1080p high that's right guys it's only
eight point three inches long I might
have to upgrade my my newly refreshed no
202 built with this sucker because holy
crap that's a lot of power and a really
tiny really tiny little compact card
here you see we've still got the same
sort of power configuration to a pin PCI
you plug this is a custom PCB obviously
look at that backplate there's no note
no glaring yellow branding or yellow
strip anymore it's completely color
neutral as is the rest of the shroud you
do get some white LEDs on the bottom of
the top these little accents here as
well as the zotac ZOTAC branding at the
front they did choose to omit the RGB
element as well as things like the fan
stock controller etc simply to make the
card as small as this certain things had
to be sacrificed in order to get it down
to this size but I think most of us
would agree that it's completely worth
it the other thing that they did was
they actually sort of bent the the five
six millimeter copper heat pipes in a
more vertical orientation for the beam
completely flat they kind of do this
little little bent here and that was
also another method that they used to
get the card down to this size pretty
impressive
have you taken a close look at the fans
here you'll notice that they're a little
different the one of the right is 100
millimeters it's basically designed for
optimal airflow one of the left is
slightly smaller than 90 millimeters and
that's optimized for static pressure
no word on MSRP just yet but this part
is gonna be launching very soon probably
in the next month or two so keep an eye
out for that so here's another cool new
thing that I spotted the zotac booth
this is their Arctic storm mini GT X
1080 P I which is pretty much working
the same exact PCB as the card we just
looked at except it's got a nice little
mini waterblock on it this is currently
again the world's smallest sort of a
beam going on your world smallest water
block for this particular GPU which is
also very exciting comes with this nice
little Jena quarter inch adapter here
for your Inlet and outlet now so tacky
shouting temperatures with this guy in
the 40s and 50s that's in degrees
Celsius which is very good that's
actually very much on par with their
full-sized Arctic storm water blog for
the GTX 1080i so that's really nice that
you're getting the same sort of thermal
performance as you are with a full-size
block and I will say that it is a full
full coverage you're not just covering
your GPU but your memory and your vrm as
well that's awesome to see so there
reminds me one thing I forgot to mention
about the GTX head API mini air-cooled
version is that we're still sort of
working on the thermal situation they're
hitting 82 degrees Celsius under load
currently which I told them that's a
little warm they said yes sir they're
doing a little bit more tweaking in
order to bring that down hopefully to
the mid to high 70s that's a very
warmest so let me know in the comments
what's the comfortable low temperature
for a GPU of this size and and
horsepower for you guys let me know
alright guys that's going to concluded
for my brief coverage of the zotac booth
here at Computex 2017 once again huge
showed us all my sponsors be quiet cable
mod verdict gear and EVGA for making
this trip possible go ahead and check
out their stuff in the link of the
description below and I'll see you guys
in the next one here at Computex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
