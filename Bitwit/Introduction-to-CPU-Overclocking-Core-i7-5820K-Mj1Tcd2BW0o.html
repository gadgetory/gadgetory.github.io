how's it going guys Kyle here with
awesomesauce Network welcome back to the
channel today I'm going to be doing a
little bit of overclocking nothing too
serious
and I wouldn't consider this in tutorial
by any means but this is more of like
just a casual walk through I guess of my
overclocking process that I do
personally now everyone over clocks
differently and the way overclocked is
also going to depend slightly on what
kind of desktop or what kind of system
you're running as well so I'm clocking
right now on my my personal desktop at
home this is the one I edit on and this
is the one that I do all of my encoding
for for all the YouTube videos that you
see on the channel so first off I'm in
the UEFI right here of the gigabyte the
gigabyte UEFI dual BIOS now this is an X
99 board I'm overclocking a 5820 5820k
but regardless of which has well II CPU
you might be overclocking they all
function more or less the same so you
can apply whatever I'm doing here to
your own haswell-e CPU if you have one
so jumping right into it the first thing
we'll see if we go to the frequency
settings is the CPU base clock now the
base clock starts out at 100 megahertz
by default but you can kind of adjust
certain parameters to to get you a
higher clock speed so for example if we
go to our CPU clock ratio now you can
whatever you enter here will be
multiplied by that hundred megahertz
frequency and that will give you your
your final CPU frequency so the just
below that you can see 3.3 gigahertz
right here now I'm going to just start
tuning things now you can either do this
you can do this a couple ways you can
either do it in increments so you could
go you know let's say you wanted to
overclock it to 3.5 wait but that's not
3.5 up my num lock my num lock goes on
sorry about that
change this alright so you can do three
five and if you enter that now you'll
see that our new C
you frequency is 3.5 gigahertz or 3500
megahertz so you can do it incrementally
and just keep going up and doing
stability tests every time you you go up
a notch so you can do a stability test
here and if that passes then you can go
on to the next one and you keep going
until your system crashes at that point
you could either leave it as is or you
could try increasing the voltage now
voltage basically just drives more power
to the CPU allowing you to hit those
higher clock speeds however it also
generates more heat in your system and
can also decrease the lifespan of your
CPU over time especially if you're doing
some really aggressive over volting so
the other method of overclocking is to
just kind of go go for a more aggressive
overclock from the get-go so I'm going
to go with 44 we're going to do 40 400
megahertz right here and then I'm going
to back out into the voltage obviously
I've done this before so I'm kind of
familiar with what the system is capable
of and what the CPU can handle so under
my core voltage I'm going to change this
you can see it's stock at 0.975
I'm going to do 1.3 now the reason I'm
doing 1.3 is for several reasons
the first of which is because JJ from
ASA said so he actually did say this in
the PC DIY video that he did during the
launch of haswell-e he basically said
1.3 volts is the most you should go for
for certain types of systems and my
system applies to that that field of
criteria because I'm doing a lot of
encoding and rendering I'm actually
stressed stressing my CPU
continuously for very long periods of
time so at that rate 1.3 volts should be
the max that you go now if you aren't
using your system for editing and you're
just doing more day-to-day tasks or even
some heavy gaming you could easily over
volt this quite a bit further to like
1.4 for example without too much trouble
but because I am going to be encoding a
lot on this system I'm going to keep it
at 1.3 I'm not going to go higher than
that
so let's hopefully hopefully this will
work out I'm going to save changes and
exit and I'm just gonna let the system
boot up and by the time we get into
Windows I should be running at 4.4
gigahertz and whether or not the system
can handle it will depend on if it can
pass the stability test that I
throw at it the stability test that I'm
going to be using today is a cease real
bench the reason why I'm using real
bench is because it actually does a lot
of real-world applications when testing
unlike print something like prime95
where it's literally just maxing out all
the cores at the same time it doesn't
really reflect a representative workload
for what you might experience on a
day-to-day event all right so I've
opened up the program I'm going to go
over to stress test and let's just do a
15-minute run
I have 16 gigs loaded into this system
so I'm going to select that and just
give it a second to gather the system
information so that it can run the
appropriate tests and once that's done
you can just go ahead and start and
it'll do its thing again these are all
real world type workloads that it's
putting on my CPU CPU is at a hundred
percent usage right now you can see that
we're hitting the 4.4 gigahertz
overclock that we set with that
multiplier of 44 and it's super tiny
text but there it is still with the
default bus speed of a hundred megahertz
now so far so good doesn't look like
we're crashing crashing or anything on
but I'm going to let this run the whole
15 minutes to see and make sure that
we're stable before we try pushing the
CPU even further all right we're back
into the UEFI now because we actually
did pass our stress test in rail bench
so I'm going to go back to the frequency
settings and crank this up to 45 so
we're going to go for 4.5 gigahertz here
at again at 1.3 volts and I'm going to
see if we can run the same stress test
and still be stable
all right so I'm a little sad that we
couldn't hit 4.5 at 1.3 volts but I
guess it's not a huge deal this just
means that I'm probably within the I
don't know 70 to 80 percentile of
haswell-e CPUs that shipped out from
Intel I think Paul was able to hit four
point six or four point seven at one
point three don't quote me on that but
I'm pretty sure he got a really well bin
CPU so good for him Paul you suck for
hogging up all the good CPUs so I'm
gonna have to go back down to 44 damn
NumLock
so I'm going to go back to 44 and then
I'm going to go back into the frequency
I'm sorry the voltage settings my CPU
core voltage now I'm going to see if I
can get away with a lower voltage
because that'll save me a little bit of
power so instead of one point three
let's go one point two nine five I'm
gonna run the same stress test so you
can see for those of you not too
familiar with overclocking it is a very
tedious and time-consuming task if you
want to do it all manually yourself but
obviously that's that's one of the fun
things about it is being able to tweak
and tune your system and doing a lot of
trial and error seeing what works and
what doesn't but when you find that
perfect stable overclock it's a really
good feeling so let's jump back in here
and see what we can do
alright so we're about three minutes
into real bench right now and so far
we're looking good
temperatures right now in our hottest
core is 88 degrees Celsius and I'm not
going to let that bother me again I'm
not too concerned about what the temps
are in real Bench I'm more concerned
about what I'm going to be seeing when
I'm doing some real-world applications
while this is a real-world stress test
it's it's not exactly I'm not going to
be running real bench every time I boot
my computer up I'm going to be rendering
videos using Photoshop editing videos
and stuff like that now that being said
you should still have an adequate
cooling solution if you're going to be
putting an aggressive overclock on your
system and on your CPU and speaking of
which I've got a Corsair H one
hundred-eyed GTX currently cooling the
5820k in my system
it's a 240 millimeter liquid cooler it's
doing a great job so far and that's also
allowed me to push the envelope and
limitations of the CPU a bit further
than if I were using an air cooler for
example or even a liquid cooler with a
smaller radiator alright so we just
finished up our 15 minute stress test in
Rio bench and we passed no crashing
nothing like that so I think we're
to go I did want to point out that you
guys may have noticed that the speed
here was reading 30 300 megahertz the
whole time during the test but midway
through the test I pulled up cpu-z and
we were in fact running at 4400
megahertz so I just want to get a give
you guys some reassurance there must
just be a glitch with real Bench aside
from that our max temp was 94 degrees
Celsius on the hottest core which
honestly looks pretty alarming but if
there was something horribly wrong the
CPU would have just shut down to prevent
any kind of damage from happening to the
CPU so at this point you could go back
into your UEFI and if your particular
BIOS allows it you can do things like
change your voltage setting to adaptive
voltage because right now we are at just
a fixed voltage so whether we're under
load or whether I'm at a low power State
idling I'm still going to be at one
point two nine five volts and that can
honestly wear and do some wear and tear
on your CPU over time so switching it to
something like the adaptive voltage can
really help you save some energy and
some power and longevity in your CPU as
well and in closing I just want to
quickly share some performance numbers
with you guys because when it comes to
overclocking your Hardware seeing how
much extra performance you can squeeze
out of it is what it's really all about
so I've already done to render tests in
Adobe Premiere Pro cs6 they were
five-minute clips or it was a
five-minute clip at 1080p h.264 and it
had a bunch of color correction filters
on it just to make the test a little bit
more taxing and at the clock at the
stock clock frequency of 3.4 gigahertz I
was able to render the clip in about 6
minutes and 34 seconds which isn't too
bad I mean this is still has well ISO
even its dock clock frequencies you're
getting pretty good render times but
then after dialing in the overclock of
40 400 megahertz I was able to shave
that down to just 5 minutes and 15
seconds at that point you're talking
almost real-time encoding right I mean
that was probably almost a minute of
render time for every minute of footage
so definitely able to shave down quite a
bit there and when you're talking about
longer projects like when I render an
episode of awesome hardware which is
sometimes over an hour long I mean in
the long run you're saving yourself
hours upon hours of encoding time which
is a really nice to see also did want to
point out that the hottest my CPU ever
got during the overclocked render test
was 78 degrees Celsius I believe it was
on core number 4 that one tends to get a
little bit hotter than the others but
obviously you can see that's much lower
than what we were hitting with the real
bench stress test and again I think the
best way to
test to see how hot your hardware gets
is to really just run the applications
that you normally run day-to-day gives
you the most accurate representation
it's most indicative of what you're
expected to see but that of course is
just what works for me personally and I
guess that's kind of why I wanted to
share this experience with you and kind
of just show you what I go through when
I overclock my CPU at home but hopefully
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
