a to special thanks to them for making
this possible what we're talking about
today is Wi-Fi specifically the Wi-Fi in
my and Wi-Fi sauce is home I've been
pretty happy with the Wi-Fi here for the
most part I'd say about 80% of the time
but that other 20% is largely in part
because we have a growing number of
internet or Wi-Fi connected devices in
the household and we have a much larger
house than we used to have at my
grandparents place where we only really
occupied half of the home really so just
like a lot of other households I'm sure
we have this increasing need to expand
our wireless network to make it reach in
further pockets of the home and for it
to be faster as well as we have more and
more devices at our disposal let me show
you guys exactly what I mean so right
now we're in the far northeast corner of
the home and this is our current router
the Asus blue K if we've actually had
this a couple of years now and it's been
great but now that we have a larger home
and many more connected devices it's
like I said cutting it about 80% of the
time so let me just give you a quick
tour I've kind of set things up for the
purpose of this little demo that we're
doing here so this is me in the wife's
bedroom it's kind of messy she'll hate
me for putting this in the video but you
can see I've got some Amazon Prime
streaming here at 1080p and it's it's
looking pretty fresh the playback looks
pretty smooth and doesn't look like
there's really any issues here of course
this out of all the devices in this
little demo is the closest one to the
router let's go ahead over here into the
studio where you'll find hot line just
chilling hey there baby
she's streaming to 4k 60fps YouTube
videos at the moment and it's also
looking pretty good alright let's let's
carry on let's just keep going down the
house here now this is the family room
by the entryway of the house this is
we're about midway through the house at
this point you can see I've got another
4k stream going here from Netflix no
complaints very very smooth playback
once again but then our final area of
the house no real connected devices in
the kitchen or dining room but in the
living room in the back here yet again
two more 4k 60fps streams on YouTube
that are also looking very clean
actually no issues there the only thing
that's really being held up at this
point is my phone you barely just missed
it it wasn't actually playing for a
second there you can see if there's a
bit of buffering here if I just skip to
a different point in the video that
hasn't already been buffered you can see
that it's just kind of chilling there
because we just don't have the bandwidth
and the efficiency needed to actually
drive all the streams that are in this
house right now so like I said most of
time this is not a problem because it's
just my wife and I and even though we
have a lot of devices there's only two
people however occasionally we do have
guests come over and they all have their
phones they'll connect to our Wi-Fi
network and at some point it eventually
caps and things slowed down someone's
not getting video it's especially
important for us because we live by a
mountain where a lot of people just
don't have good cell reception here
regardless of the carrier that they're
using so all these little issues kind of
pile up to be a larger problem that
we're gonna solve today hopefully so
we're gonna actually try to remedy a
problem today
with a couple of these RTA x88 u routers
from Asus Asus was the first to come to
the market actually with an ax mesh
solution so we're actually gonna be
setting up a mesh network today with the
ax standard 802 11 8 X now this is a
vast improvement over AC for a number of
reasons first of all we're getting much
faster speeds the ceiling is much higher
with a X because the channels are a lot
wider there's more bandwidth available
but I would say even more importantly
than that especially for our needs today
is that the efficiency has been much
improved with how the data is
transmitted between the access point and
all the clients so for example we've got
this handy little acronym Oh food OFDM a
which is basically a way to take the
channels and split them into a bunch of
smaller channels so that can handle data
transmission to a number of devices
independently and simultaneously as
opposed to dealing with them in a
sequential order one at a time you've
also got multi-user MIMO which I'm sure
while you guys are familiar with but
it's even more efficient on a X because
now we can actually address multiple
devices at the same time whether you're
downloading or uploading and we also
have some stuff on the back here more
stuff about bandwidth security security
this thing has some great security
features like a eye protection Pro which
automatically updates your security
signatures on a regular basis just just
to protect your data we also have gaming
features of course QoS is an integrated
technology that basically is packet
prioritization so you never slow down
you never get thrown off your game from
other devices being connected in the
home we also have wtfast which i think
is a clever marketing term because
you've got WTF if you cover up the eyes
anyway I'm getting off-topic this
basically seeks out the shortest route
between your PC and a game server so
that it reduces your ping and you're in
your lag time very nice to have on board
if you're a hardcore gamer and you just
don't have the option to wire directly
and then also speeds ax is fast is
basically all that says no I'm not a
networking geek by any stretch but I am
super excited to get this
network up and running especially since
it's gonna be with the new ax standard
so the way that the mesh network is
actually gonna work is that one of the
routers is going to be replacing the
blue cave and that's gonna have to be
connected directly to our modem but the
other router we can just kind of put
anywhere as sort of a wireless satellite
I'm thinking in the polar opposite
corner of the house or at least in just
this this room in general that way we
get full house coverage and we'll even
have really good coverage in the
backyard because it's a fairly large
backyard as well I had to do a test I
stood right right here trying to stream
a Paul's hardware video and it worked
okay work just fine but as soon as I
stood like right there just a couple
feet over the connection just died like
it kicked us from the network and
everything so I have very high hopes
that this solution here will fix all of
our Wi-Fi woes but I guess there's only
one way to find out ready to do it boy
you ready you ready boy is the Wi-Fi
cats ready oh he is testing out the
wares yes our kitty overlords have
deemed this product worth stepping on
all right let's hop to it all right
we're in the office now and you can see
we've got two routers powered up they're
not connected to the internet just yet
before you actually get started setting
up a mesh network you have to ensure
that both routers are running the latest
firmware so I've already updated the
firmware by simply connecting them to
one of my PC's and then updating it
through the ACS website then once that's
good you can actually connect one of the
routers via ethernet to your PC and
let's do that and open up a browser and
you should be greeted with this page
we're gonna go into advanced settings
and set up a mesh network so I says
choose operation mode here I'm gonna
click that and it says yai mesh right
there so that's obviously what we want
it says the ai mesh system is composed
of Asus router as one router will become
the a mesh router and you can add
additional a mesh nodes to expand your
network sounds good and then it asks if
you want to make this device the primary
router or the AMS note we're gonna go
with the router first and we'll set up
the other router as the node when we're
ready so I'm gonna add my SSID and
password really quick once that's all
entered you can click apply here it just
looks like they're asking if we want to
enable 802 mm an ax a Qi frame support
with a little note here that's some
wireless adapters may have issues
connecting to ax access points but we're
gonna go ahead and say ok ok it looks
like it wants us to add some credentials
here ok now we're into the main control
center here so looks like we've more or
less set up our first device as the
primary router in our mesh network
successfully now I'm going to go ahead
and
connect the second router and assign
this as the node and there should only
be a couple steps left after that pull
our broadband connection plug it into
our node router and take another
Ethernet cable from our PC
and boom so now we can set up the second
device as our node so choose operation
mode we're still gonna want a imesh
obviously and now we want to set it up
as a node so now it's telling us to
reset the node and then place it next to
our primary router and then we can
reconnect the router to our PC I'm gonna
go ahead and click Next and now we can
go ahead and connect our PC to the
router as you can see I move both of our
ethernet cables that were just plugged
into the node back over to the primary
router and notice that the node is still
powered on both devices are powered on
and all is done correctly we should be
brought to this screen signing with your
AC strata account which we created just
a moment ago and we're back in the
control panel with this pop-up that says
do you want to add this a imesh node to
your a imesh system why yes I do and
then it looks like it's doing something
here find a imesh node okay so it's
searching for it I think the manual does
say to keep the routers as close
together as possible initially for this
setup process and there it goes slowly
but surely it'll detect our node and add
it to the mesh network I'm gonna give it
a moment here alright so after a couple
minutes if all goes smoothly you should
see this pop-up that says we've
successfully added our node to the AI
mesh system says it should take a while
to show up as connected in the end I
should add our list and it also suggests
that you place your node between your a
IMS router and your existing dead zone
and try to place it somewhere high and
open in your home it also says you can
connect your router and your node
together with an Ethernet cable if you
wanted to for extra stability although
that's a bit more complicated with the
distance that we're trying to cross here
so we're gonna ignore that for now
alright it looks like we've got one
active AI mesh node and there it is
beautiful no it's also worth noting that
the test you're about to see
specifically the the Wi-Fi test on our
livingroom PC is using an 802 1011 AC
Wi-Fi adapter not a X because a X
adapters are just not available at the
time of filming this is shot before the
Rison 3000 series launched before X 570
boards were available of course X 570
boards do support 802 to 11a x AKA Wi-Fi
6 but those are just not available right
now so having said that let me know if
you guys would be interested in a follow
up video where I actually test our ax
mesh network with an x5 70 board to see
the full benefits of
standard all right I'm gonna go ahead
and place this guy on the other side of
the house where the dead zone is and
then we'll give it a whirl by the way I
also have our same streaming setup that
I showed at the beginning of the video
two more streams on that PC one more
there two more 4k 60s and my phone you
can see here that we're actually getting
perfectly smooth playback no choppiness
no no buffering let's just skip to
another yep it just kind of plays
instantly this was not happening
whatsoever for us with the blue cave
yeah everything's working great and
here's a look at where I put the other
router issue says to put it in a high
space if possible somewhere that's open
I tried to elevate it a little bit so
between these two routers we have whole
house coverage and I'll actually do the
the same test that I did earlier as well
so we're gonna take this out outside got
a fire up a Paul's Harbor video just to
keep things consistent you know okay I'm
actually at the far corner of the
backyard down actually a bit further
away than I even was previously and you
can see where we're having no issues
streaming in Paul let me skip ahead here
instantly loads whoo Paul you've never
looked so good
I think the demo pretty much speaks for
itself I mean I wasn't really able to
stream much of anything on this phone
while all the other streams in the house
were going on but now it seems totally
fine we have full coverage not just in
the house but in the entire backyard as
well I think the last thing I want to do
is show you guys just a before-and-after
Wi-Fi speed test we actually have
speedtest.net pulled up I did run the
numbers with the blue cave and we were
getting around 66 67 down and about 25
up and I know that's not terrible for
everyone a lot of households don't even
get close to those speeds but for our
specific needs we've definitely started
to feel a need for more speed and
throughput and everything so with that
said why don't we go ahead and see what
we're getting now
oh okay okay I can I can work with that
okay we went from oh dang I I was
expecting it to be good but that's
that's phenomenal we were from 66 to 250
megabits per second down holy moly
and the up went from 25 to 91 so if you
guys were just looking for some straight
data there you go that's that's awesome
so I guess in summary my first
experience with 802 11 ax and mesh Wi-Fi
was a huge success huge thanks to issues
for sponsoring this video if you guys
want to check out these routers I'll put
some links in the description below but
that's all for me guys I'm gonna get out
of here thanks for watching toss a like
on the video if you enjoyed it it helps
a lot get subscribe for more tech stuff
coming at you really soon and I will see
you all in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
