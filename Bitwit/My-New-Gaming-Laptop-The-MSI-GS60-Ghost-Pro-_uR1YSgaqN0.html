enthusiasts apparel awesomesauce shirts
are not only threaded they're hyper
threaded and come factory overclocked
get yours today at the awesomesauce
store what's up guys so today's video
comes with a very sad announcement that
I wish I didn't have to make but in
light of recent events I'm currently in
the midst of a breakup with a long-term
partner of mine
I'm so sorry I'm so sorry had to cover
this again you've been so good to me but
I just like it good anymore tired I'm so
sorry
there's one lucky laptop that's right
I'm breaking up with my Asus g550 gaming
laptop it was my choice I'll be it a
difficult one we had a good run for
about a year and a half which is around
the time she started having performance
issues in bed yeah yeah what 30 FPS
what's wrong what don't you want to talk
about it
Oh fine go to sleep like you always do
as you can see we've been going through
some real days of our lives and
just when I thought I couldn't bear the
weight any longer I met her the msi GSC
dost pro now I know it's only been a
week but already she's opened my mind to
these new ideas and made me believe that
I'm worthy of being loved so today I'm
doing what one should never do in this
situation and that's make an online
video comparing my new partner to my old
one right off the bat I should mention
that the GS 60 does have more expensive
taste than the Asus g550 retailing for
around $1700 but when you look at the
specs side-by-side you can clearly see
where that extra Green has been spent
the ghost pro sports a new six gen core
i7 skylake mobile CPU twice the RAM
capacity at ddr4 mind.you a 128 gig nvme
SSD and a gtx 970m with three gigs of
gddr5 the difference in spec alone here
is a compelling proposition and while I
firmly believe that it's what's on the
inside that counts just take a look at
how sexy this thing is hot damn with a
width of just 0.7 inches of full metal
chassis and brushed aluminum finish this
is one of the slimmest and most
attractive gaming laptops in MSI's
lineup now by no means is the G 550 a
whale at one point one inches thick in
fact I usually prefer more cushion for
the motion but being extra thin and
nearly 2 pounds lighter make the ghost
that much easier to handle on the go
fixings on the left side included
Kensington lock DC power are only 2 USB
3 and audio jacks for mic and headphone
well I personally don't mind losing a
USB port coming from the g550
this my
be an issue for users looking to use the
ghost Pro as a desktop replacement by
connecting an assortment of peripherals
and external drives on the right side is
a killer a 2400 Gigabit LAN port mini
DisplayPort 1.0 and HDMI 1.4 an SD card
reader and a USB 3.1 type-c connector
that allows you to expand your screen
real estate by daisy chaining to 4k
panels at 60 Hertz or you can quickly
charge your mobile devices with 5 volts
at 3 amps at the front we find a row of
LED indicators for things like battery
life Bluetooth and AC Wi-Fi the bottom
plate can be removed to access the
internal components but for some reason
one of the back plate screws is covered
by an evil sticker that stands between
me and a free world of beautiful
hardware like the kim jeong-hoon of
stickers under the hood you'll find your
hard drive Wi-Fi module RAM and m2 PCIe
SSD though you will have to do a bit of
extra work to reach these last two
components since they're mounted
underneath the main PCB here you'll also
find the six cell battery which is
really the Achilles heel of this device
yielding only one hour and 47 minutes of
battery life at full screen brightness
during general browsing YouTube and word
processing switching over to straight
gameplay the battery only managed to
keep the laptop alive for a measly 40
minutes on the bright side potential
buyers of the ghost pro who don't plan
on using a power brick 90% of the time
can swap the battery out for a sweet
potato giving you twice the power upon
opening the lid were met with a 1080p
webcam at 30fps and a 15.6 inch 1920 by
1080 IPS anti-glare display now although
you won't find anything revolutionary
about the screen quality as it's right
on par with the older Asus g5 50 colors
are well represented with excellent
contrast as is often the case with IPS
panels my unit does suffer some heavy
backlight bleed in the upper left region
of the screen which fortunately is only
noticeable while viewing a dark scene in
a dimly lit environment one perk msi
brings to the table here is their true
color software that's basically an
enhanced version of a gaming monitors
on-screen display from here you can
select different color profiles from
various tasks and even assign profiles
to specific applications there's also an
anti blue mode to help reduce eyestrain
during prolonged use much like the
popular flux software at the base of the
screen is an LED power button and what
looks to be the system speakers at first
glance but these are simply ventilation
holes for the internal hardware instead
MSI
has smartly placed the two Dynaudio
speakers at the front underneath the
laptop that in my opinion does a better
job of projecting the sound by bouncing
off the desk surface adding to their
list of included software being the
hemic sound suite gives audio a
significant boost that turns the once
humdrum laptop audio into something that
actually sounds pretty good sure it
still doesn't rival a basic Bluetooth
speaker and gamers will most likely have
their headphones wired in anyway but
that doesn't change the fact that this
is really the first time I've ever used
the words sounds pretty good when
referring to laptop audio among
enhancements to your mic and stream
audio majimak also features customizable
profiles to suit various forms of media
playback the virtual 7.1 surround is
excellent for movies and gaming when
paired with a good set of cans and I
love having the volume boost option in
case I ever want to use a pair of high
impedance headphones navigating the GS
60 is both fluid and responsive using
the touchpad to move click to finger
scroll and pinch to zoom your way
through Windows 10 it also features a
slightly rough surface which does a nice
job of adding some grip while keeping it
dry to the touch just as superb is the
chiclet style keyboard from SteelSeries
with laser etched keys that's received
the same tactile surface treatment as
the touchpad goldilocks and I agree that
key size and spacing are just right and
a solid travel distance makes gaming and
typing a surprisingly comfortable
experience for a laptop while backlit
keys are always welcome SteelSeries has
gone a step further and implemented RGB
LEDs into the mix with a variety of
lighting modes to choose from in their
engine software unfortunately you can't
assign perky lighting but rather the
program splits the keyboard into three
separate zones that can then be
configured to your liking the software
also lets you assign macros to virtually
any key on the board and assign your
profiles to launch with specific
applications apart from the baked in
software we've already discussed you get
a simple MSI monitoring app and a
one-year license of xsplit gamecaster
beyond that you won't find much
bloatware on the GS 60 save for the
obligatory antivirus program in the 4
of Norton consequently MSI should have
also thrown in a pop-up blocker now at
this point in my review it's safe to say
that I'm already smitten by the ghost
pros outstanding design and feature set
but if there's one deal-breaker when it
comes to gaming laptops it's when the
device doesn't perform as expected and
that doesn't just go for gaming laptops
fortunately this puppy screens in almost
every triple-a title I tested frequently
topping 70 FPS on high settings and
performing 55 percent better on average
than my aging impotent lover the biggest
landslide victory was in Metro last
light where the Ghost Pro scored a
whopping 69% higher average FPS now
surprisingly we actually saw higher
minimum frames per second with the g550
but overall the gameplay experience
between the two laptops is night and day
even if you do get some light screen
tearing on both models now as expected
the faster ghost pro's 970m gets hotter
than the g550
850 m and this translates to a lot more
fan noise and slightly higher GPU temps
with my new squeeze at the same time the
GS 60 delivers much more effective CPU
cooling which kept the chip cool in the
low 70s well-placed ventilation on
nearly every side of the chassis also
allows the fans to exhaust hot air
without cooking your hands to a crisp in
closing MSI has shown us once again why
it's one of the best gaming laptop
manufacturers in the business there's
really a lot that can go wrong when
you're trying to cram a powerful gaming
system into an oversized slice of bread
and while it's not perfect the GS 60
ghost produce most high-end mobile
gaming experiences on the market that's
sure to satisfy hardcore gamers on the
go I'd also like to add this would make
for a killer editing laptop or streaming
laptop as well as for the Asus g550
well I can tell by the way she wakes
when I touch her at night but she hasn't
