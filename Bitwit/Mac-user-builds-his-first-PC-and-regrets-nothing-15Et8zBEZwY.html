NZXT brings even more possibilities to
your setup with addressable RGB
underglow cable combs and monitor
lighting with a unique ambient mode that
pulls colors from your primary display
to create a one-of-a-kind gaming
experience check out everything q2 has
to offer in the link below alright y'all
so we're back again and I have Chris
here in the studio
you guys know Chris he helps us out with
camera stuff and editing once in a while
and today we are building a system for
him now you've actually built some rigs
in the past but this will be the first
one that you're actually assembling for
yourself correct yes why exactly do you
need a PC right now what is this for
well I'm gonna be you know editing a lot
of stuff I have obviously a lot of
projects going on that I work on myself
that I'll edit that all color
I usually go through a lot of the Adobe
products that are very you know Hardware
intensive can be a bit crippling to try
and navigate through the programs
without having good a good PC and my
iMac right now the IMAX just not cutting
it right now so I figured what the heck
it's also kind of confusing to me
because traditionally I've known you as
an Apple user you know you have an iMac
you've had MacBook Pros and things like
that in your hash so why the sudden
switch over to PC well simply put Kyle
I'd be spending twice the amount on a on
an Apple product and beginning less than
half of the performance I I have no
further questions your honor that's a
damn good reason if I've ever heard one
and it makes a lot of sense additionally
you'll be able to upgrade and sort of a
maintain your system a bit more readily
than that is also true with the product
that's sold by a company that believes
in the close week ecosystem but we're
not here to talk about that let's let's
discuss a little bit more about your rig
here so we actually have a pretty nice
all-star lineup of hardware starting
with the CPU this is actually one that I
have donated from the from the bit wit
bin that's a seventy nine hundred x core
I nine skylake X processor from good ol
Intel it's got 10 cores 20 threads it's
it's a total beast and I'm sure a lot of
the applications that you're using are
multi-threaded in nature it's good that
since you'll be using a lot of software
that can actually leverage those
additional cores and threads that were
packing in
quite a quite a number of course threats
here that'll be really nice it's gonna
be slotting into what is this border
this is the x2 99m gaming Pro carbon a/c
from MSI I really didn't want to go with
a large full tower case which is kind of
why we're going micro ATX today are we
favoring a smaller system this time
around because it's gonna be mobile some
of the time it's gonna be portable it's
gonna be mobile BAM I sometimes have
some some jobs where I have to take you
know my PC on the road with me or just
in general like if I'm going to go edit
somewhere far away from home then it's
got to be somewhat portable here to
handle any budget makes sense and this
is actually just a beautiful board in
general as is apart from the form factor
you're getting of course the LGA 2066
socket with quad-channel memory support
which we will be taking for advantage of
as well as MDOT to support with nvme
drives and things like that USB 3.1 gen2
type-c and the list goes on so thank you
to MSI for providing this we also have a
killer memory kit here we actually have
32 gigs of G skills tried Enzi RGB ddr4
at 3200 speed so we've got fast memory I
believe it's a cache latency 16 so
that's also pretty pretty sweet and you
might notice that we actually have two
kits there instead of one 32 gig kits
and that was because you had better
deals on on buying the kits individually
during Black Friday correct or better
deals than buying a whole whole kit
which is fine as long as they're the
same spec and things like that they
should be working just fine together and
if not you know who to call
Oh suppose she's skilled oh definitely
definitely not me don't worry co-sponsor
don't just or ghost but as long as it's
not me fine moving on though we've got a
pretty nice storage solution here -
Chris these were picked out by you as
well tell us about these and your
rationale behind them well I figured
once you go black you can never go any
other delusion so yeah I picked up the
500 gig m dot - nvme Western Digital
black this is a great Drive because
again sales and moving on to these
mechanical storage I ended up going with
to one terabyte drives the rationale
behind this was essentially I could go
for a two terabyte drive but I simply
wanted to raid zero them
and I would get better prices anyways on
the 1 terabytes they were already
available Black Friday so you know kind
of better bang for the buck with a
little bit better importance and so to
theremin yeah absolutely so by striping
them you get essentially you know
relatively double your bandwidth there
you transfer speeds and you'll be
backing things up externally I'm sure so
project already backing up everything so
that's that'll sort of alleviate some of
the risk factor of running a zero
additionally we have a lovely Cooley
here this is the H 110 I from Corsair
280 millimeter liquid a IO it's got a
very solid copper plate as well so that
should be doing a fine number on our
7900 X there we also have a killer
graphics card this is the Duke GTX I'm
sorry the Duke RTX 2070 from MSI excuse
me this is a touring card that is also
gonna be so good for all of your
workstation applications as well as any
gaming if you were to dabble in that
let's be honest are you gonna gain with
the system at all because I feel it
could be a slight shame not to given the
product stack I think I'm think I'm
gonna slip and say yes ok there's gonna
be some some heavy gaming so it's not
slipping that's just you just being
honest there's nothing no shame in that
and I think you just mention to me
earlier that you may be interested in
trying out some VR the R&amp;amp;D and
absolutely I think it's gonna be a
really great tool for pre-production and
you know a lot of previz a lot of
directors can see kind of what these CG
worlds are gonna be like so I think
that's gonna be a huge step in
filmmaking and I kind of want to get on
the forefront of that absolutely heavily
net absolutely it's also great that
these touring cards now have virtual
link built into the back so you've got
that type-c connector for next
generation of HMDs or headsets you'll
just be able to plug it in with a single
connector it's a super sweet and then
we've got a pretty nice power supply
over there Chris why don't you tell us a
little bit about that indeed we do it's
the ROG Thor and a 50 watt platinum it
is platinum certified
yes 80 plus platinum 80 + platinum it
would be a crime to be anything less it
wouldn't win aim like 550 watt you know
gold certified doesn't it well no no but
it's got a nice OLED screen telling you
what your power draw is and is actually
kind of nifty yeah it's got it's a core
it looks like it's gonna be a gorgeous
screen and we got some nice sleeve
cables that also come with it the 24 pin
the - 6 + 2 pins
the two eight pins it all come sleeve
you know I'm actually kind of curious
though is if the oullette how visible
the OLED screens gonna be underneath the
power supply shroud of our case which
you guys have probably noticed isn't
even on my table right now because it
gets its own special independent mural
because it's fancy it says we couldn't
fit it on not because we couldn't fit on
the table what up not at all is that
definitely not this is a fan text and
thewe evolved micro ATX case which is
one of the better-looking micro ATX
cases in existence I am Oh Chris seems
to agree because he actually picked
about himself
and we were initially gonna go with and
evolve X the newer case from fantex but
it's full ATX it's a you know pretty big
mid tower and the wanted to keep things
a little bit more mobile so that's why
we're going small the micro ATX real
size does not matter in this build no
absolutely not
what wifey sauce tells me did I say
anyway thank you guys for staying tuned
for the build that's what's coming up
next you can find links to all this
stuff in the description below but
without further ado I'm gonna make you
build the system we're gonna do a role
reversal I'm gonna man the camera you
build a system that does that dangerous
is that okay I can move at the sound of
that but sure let's do it all the juice
all right building fun
and here she is build complete man oh
man look at it looks really nice that's
gorgeous
I really like the style that you went
with Chris digging the sort of color
neutral live it's not completely
littered with with RGB in fact let me
turn it on should we turn it on shall
you do the owners know you have to do
the honors it's your bill you built it
it's your business this case here right
here attacked me I don't know how but
apparently it just gave me a huge gash
in my finger so very sharp edges in this
case but hey you know what you made a
blood sacrifice to the PC gods and
because of that this is now a holy
blessed rig and it will serve you well
for years to come that's what that means
all right let's go ahead and alright but
lower it on with the blood finger the
blood finger no better way
oh Jesus fan blade is hitting something
oh oh and I think our graphics card
cables were hitting the fan it's the
zip-tie long cables but it seems like
you just had to move it out of the way
and I think that's why at higher speeds
it went way okay the graphics part is
actually not on okay the system is
powered on and it's booted just as you
know insert boot media and selecting
device first anything all that so hey
we've we've cleared posts you also might
notice that there are some new additions
to this case that we didn't mention in
the beginning of the video for starters
the Halos luxe RGB fan frames which are
also from fantex we actually threw those
in there last minute just to give the
system more of a bling factor and of
course since they're from fantex in the
same anthracite gray of the cases then
they match also going also it's you
beautiful and we also have at the front
of the case we installed two Corsair ML
140 Pro Maglev fans these are some of
the best in the industry we felt in a
relatively air constrictive case
especially at the front panel that
really good intake fans were necessary
so do it
it's like yep like all around I mean
yeah it's if there's an attending
there's a bit of air going through here
and we've got one two three four so five
140 millimeter fans in this system it is
audible for sure granted we don't have
the side panel on but it is audible
I'm sure it'd be a bit quieter with the
side panel on and you can even configure
fans in the future crest if you'd like
to bring down the acoustics a smidge
even though this is a beautiful build of
course you're gonna go in and adjust all
the RGB as you see fit later on it
doesn't mean we were without any snacks
there were a couple of moments if you
will I think the first one was the
clearance actually between this rear
included fan was the 140 and the actual
aisle cover of the motherboard it's a
combination of this being a relatively
narrow case this being a large fan and
that IO shield just being a little bit
on the high side they're definitely
pushing against each other that quite a
bit making contact yeah we could have
avoided it easily altogether if we just
downgraded to a 120 millimeter fan at
the back but who wants to do that we
also had somewhat of a close call with
the the front fans and the AIO tubes oh
yeah there's a bit of a clearance issue
there but we simply just slowed the fans
down not a big deal how about that power
supply do that PSU I know that OLED
screen is sexy AF really smexy my
goodness plus there's or a sync RGB down
there that you can configure to your
heart's content you want to talk about
some of the cable management Christopher
well you know you have all these
components and whatnot cable management
can get a little rough with all the RGB
and all the fans that we have in this
case true it was a little difficult we
had to make sure that all the cables
were really hugging that motherboard but
I think we got it
for the most part successfully in the
air and it's pretty flush it also
doesn't help us any that the side panel
on the back is is magnetic only so
there's no actual physical screens which
definitely means you you know you got to
be hugging that that tray pretty closely
but for the most part everything looks
and is functioning properly so we're
ready for we're ready for Windows 10
installation and you can officially take
your new system home starting starting
today great so congratulations on your
your first PC for yourself thank you
you've also assembled yourself thank you
and I hope it it serves you well for a
baby I know but that's gonna do it for
now guys thank you so much for tuning in
be sure to send your congratulations
Chris's way either in the comments or on
social media be sure to salsa like on
this video if you enjoyed it because it
was a damn good video and you should
also get subscribed to the channel for
more tech stuff coming at you really
soon but till next time guys thanks
again for watching have a good one and
we'll
see you in the next video know what I
said either way it works with his
channel now it's yours it's actually PJ
