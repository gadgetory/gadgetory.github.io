get yours today on the awesomesauce tool
what's up guys today I'm taking a look
at what I would consider an ideal
graphic solution for a portable gaming
PC this is the r9 285 ITX compact from
sapphire and the one I have here with me
today is the OC edition which comes back
to read overclocked now before you blow
up the comment section and say things
like but Kyle the 300 series is just
around the corner why would I even care
about the 200 series at this point and
yes if you're looking to upgrade the
video card in your gaming desktop it
makes sense to see what AMD brings to
the table with its next line of GPUs
which is now just mere weeks maybe even
days away from its big release but if
you've been tossing around the idea of
building that HTPC for your living room
or that portable LAN rig that you can
pick up in a moment's notice an AR 9200
series card can still go a long way in
terms of performance and features
sapphires mini r9 285 being a reasonable
option as most of us know by now the r9
285 fills that price gap between the r9
280 and 280x
though at its core the 285 shares more
in common with the latter as both ships
are in fact tonga GPUs utilizing AMD's
GCN 1.2 architecture remember that the
r9 280 is simply a rebranded Radeon HD
7950 sporting a Tahiti GPU a chip that's
now more than three years old and
carrying a slimmer feature set with its
GCN 1.0 architecture as far as Ross
specs go this card has a base clock of
928 megahertz which tweakers can push
quite a ways further as the r9 285 is a
great overclocker
and no I don't mean those tweakers
packin 1792 stream processors the card
has a memory clock speed of 50 500
megahertz on a 256 bit interface with a
2 gig frame buffer while it's true that
the r9 280 has 3 gigs of memory on a
wider bus iterations said the GCN
architecture have improved the overall
memory bandwidth efficiency of the 285
which serves to compensate for the lower
memory spec also with the Tonga chip
comes better power efficiency allowing
the car to run at a 190 watt TDP that 60
watts lower than the Tahiti based r9 280
surely this lower heat output is a bit
plus when building in an era started
mini-itx system while everything under
the hood seems appropriate for a current
retail price of 220 USD let's talk about
the actual hood no not that hood I
should really stop using double
entendres
the cards dual slot cooler spends just
171 millimeters long which allows it to
fit in a wide range of even the smallest
Mini ITX cases on the front is a single
85 millimeter fan surrounded by a
polycarbonate shroud with metal plated
accents that make us wish more mini ITX
chass√©s had side panel windows to
appreciate the cards stylish design from
the side angle we can see the cooler has
four copper heat pipes two of which are
6 millimeters thick
the other two are 8 millimeters thick
there's also a dual BIOS switch that
toggles between legacy or UEFI
compatibility mode this button resides
where you might expect to find a
crossfire finger but like other cards in
the 200 series the r9 285 doesn't
require a physical bridge for multi-gpu
setups at the front we get a better look
at the aluminum fin of our heatsink and
a single 8 pin PCIe connector off to the
far right which promotes less clutter
than having two 6-pin connectors here's
a quick look at sapphires compact PCB
which measures the same length as the
cooler fortunately and incorporates a
classy matte black finish finally on the
rear we get two mini display ports full
size HDMI and dual link DVI outputs you
also get some generous accessories
including a 1.8 meters HDMI cable a 2 6
pin 2 single 8 pin PCIe adapter d sub 2
dual link DVI adapter mini DisplayPort 2
full-size DisplayPort adapter a mousepad
along with driver CV and documentation
while I found the card to be plenty
quiet under load I decided not to
conduct any benchmarks as dozens of
tests online already demonstrate the r9
285 s Pro s staying neck-and-neck within
videos similarly priced gtx 960 in most
games where this card really shows its
value however is in its form factor this
is still one of the most powerful GPUs
for its size apart from the few GTX 970
s out there which retail for over $100
more if your main gaming rig needs a
serious upgrade there's no doubt that
waiting for the 300 series and even
invidious gtx 980ti is a wise choice but
those of you seeking a secondary
portable machine on a budget
Center this compact yet capable card
from sapphire as a suitable option but
let me know what you guys think of this
card in the comments and I'm also
curious to know which flagship card from
team writer team green you're currently
waiting for the most as always toss me a
like on this video if you enjoyed it and
