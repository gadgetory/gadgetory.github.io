I got the clap whoa don't tell my wife
okay what's going on guys so this is
just gonna be sort of a casual video I'm
gonna talk to you about a new little
monitor that I got it's a new portable
monitor from you perfect some Chinese
brand I actually bought this for an
upcoming project that I've got in the
works but I wasn't initially gonna do a
standalone video on this display until I
realize just how how nifty it is there's
a lot of little interesting features and
quirks about it that I think you guys
might enjoy and it's so versatile that I
wanted to put it on your guys's radar
just in case you have a need for it this
is the you perfect 13.3 inch portable
monitor this video is brought to you by
mod Mike modular Mike you can fix to any
set of headphones for the best of both
worlds high-quality voice audio superb
noise cancelling and the option for
Wired or wireless models are just a few
reasons I've been using their products
for years mod mic is a great no
compromise solution for gamers who care
about sound click on the link below to
learn more I saw at least a couple other
monitors on Amazon it's where I got it
that looked exactly like this same
housing and everything but under a
completely different brand which means
they probably got it from the same om
that being said the brand could still
make potential changes to the to the end
product so for all intents and purposes
I would consider this more or less a
unique product and just for reference I
have my msi gs70 laptop just beside it
so you can kind of see it
full-scale this is dive into some specs
here this is a 13.3 inch display 1920 by
1080 is the native resolution it has a
color gamut of 72% ntsc and a response
time of two milliseconds don't believe
that we'll talk about response time
later but that's that's a bogus claim
this is an IPS display leading us to
believe that colors are good viewing
angle is good response time is garbage
suspect that's not listed here is 60
Hertz we have a refresh rate of 60 Hertz
now in the box I found a USB type a two
type-c cable there was a full-sized HDMI
cable in there a user's manual a chintzy
stand like super cheap I mean super
basic gets the job done but I would try
to replace it ASAP there was also a 5
volt 3 amp wall charger but
you can power it with the USBC as well
now as far as the monitor itself goes
the build quality is a lot more
impressive than I thought it would be
it's it's super solid it's brushed
aluminum all around and it has these
really nice thin bezels on the sides on
the top the chin is a little bit thicker
but there's no branding which is a huge
plus in my book and in the bottom right
corner of the display there's a hole
that's apparently for a pen if you want
Stuka pen in there and use it as a stand
like a makeshift span I've seen this
before and I actually tried it out with
this display it works well I actually
kind of liked it better than the cheap
stand that they included I really loved
that the screen is Matt it wasn't listed
anywhere on the product page I was
looking for it at least for me I prefer
a matte screen less glare less
reflections it's actually kind of the
same sort of matte treatment that you'd
find on the GS 65 stealth very similar
in that sense where you're not looking
at yourself when you're in the middle of
the game so that was nice to see behind
the display there's a quartet of
threaded screws that are presumably for
some sort of weird base amount that I'm
not familiar with if you guys know just
comment down below but yeah it's sort of
been a weird trapezoidal configuration
as opposed to the traditional square so
I'm not exactly sure what what kind of
mount it supports but they're there
don't mind that magnetic plate in the
middle I actually added that after the
fact it's not stock I put it on there
for the upcoming project that I
mentioned earlier on the left side you
get a micro USB port and I saw them use
that on the product page if you want to
hook up like a wired keyboard and mouse
you could do so straight through your
monitor using like a micro USB to USB
type a adapter like an on-the-go adapter
so that's actually kind of cool just
below that are five OSD buttons that are
really tiny
especially for my fat nubby fingers they
could have been a little bit bigger but
I guess I'm not going to complain too
much they do have a nice clique to them
and they let you navigate through a
surprisingly good amount of options
you've got your typical run-of-the-mill
brightness contrast and sharpness
adjustment there's different presets
ranging from standard to gaming to movie
and so forth you can change the color
temperature or your individual red green
and blue parameters as well as change
where the OSD sits on your screen if you
want to be wedged into a corner or right
smack dab in the middle like it is now
there's also HDR mode which is not true
HDR by any means it kind of just throws
like a saturation filter on the screen
which I think
some tuning you know in the OSD you
might be able to make it look decent in
some games or even movies but it's it's
not it's not true HDR and then you've
got low blue light adjustment volume
this actually has speakers built-in
speakers that get pretty loud with
relatively little distortion
surprisingly I wouldn't use them for
your everyday sound but you know apart
from being relatively tinny and not
having much of a low-frequency
representation they actually don't sound
too bad for what you might expect but
the real kicker here is the free sync
option I did not know that this thing
supported free sync there was no listing
of that no mention of it on the product
page so I was really surprised to find
it so I found out that the range is
actually 40 to 60 fps which is not great
I shouldn't say it's not great because
if you have like an entry level or a
budget GPU or even like a Raven Ridge
APU you might be hitting that 40 to 60
fps sweet spot and hey you got free sync
all throughout that range but for
everyone else if you're most likely
above that you're probably not going to
benefit much from the free sync
implementation here it's also worth
noting that this is not free sync - so
you miss out on certain features like
low framerate compensation so if you dip
below that 40 fps and I did test this on
the panel
you are gonna immediately start screen
tearing you know assuming that the game
is prone to it after playing around with
it some more I also learned that the
free sync is only supported over HDMI
which means it's not AG sync compatible
display it will not take free sync or
use adaptive sink with a GeForce GPU I
tried it with a gtx 750ti as well as a
GTX 1080 Ti it did not work because even
though this does have a display port on
it which we'll get to
adaptive sync only works through HDMI
which does not meet the requirements for
juicing compatible monitors let's circle
back to the display itself we have a USB
type-c on the right side of the panel
this is gonna transmit power and data
it's actually how empowering the device
right now from our testbed PC back here
which is running arisin 7 1700 and an Rx
570 and just below that is another USB
type-c port but this one supports
Thunderbolt 3 so it is compatible with
Thunderbolt 3 supported devices like
this laptop so there's a single USB
type-c port here you can connect it with
a single cord and have power DisplayPort
signal additional USB all that sort of
thing with
Kable it's a very handy protocol to have
and it makes this infinitely more usable
and flexible in every way last but not
least we've got a mini DisplayPort and
HDMI port I really love the fact that
you get your pick of the letter between
the two and the fact that the HDMI is
full size because mini HDMI ports are
crap it's very flimsy and fragile it
breaks easily so the fact that we get
full size here on such a thin display
that it's probably only about 9 10
millimeters thick is is very very nice
to have I mean all together this is the
top selling point for this product is
its IO it makes this product so flexible
for you know pulling it just off the
shelf whenever you need it for whatever
device you're connecting it to as far as
the actual performance of this thing
goes I mean it looks fantastic the
brightness and contrast and sharpness of
the display is great I wouldn't say it's
it's 100% of what our GS 65 stealth is
here but it's pretty damn close and and
using it as a companion monitor with
this laptop is beautiful it's kind of
jarring when you have a companion
display that's significantly lower
quality than the primary display this is
a really nice premium you know their
previous flagship laptop being paired
with this hundred and seventy dollar
Chinese brand display it keeps its own
it holds its own and I was actually
really impressed using it as a companion
display being an IPS panel I mean the
colors really pop they're super rich and
vibrant again not 100% up to par with a
premium gaming laptop LCD but definitely
not too far behind the question that was
probably on all your guys is mine when I
started this video was can it game yes
yes it can all those characteristics I
just mentioned brightness contrast
sharpness color they all benefit a
gaming experience as well and this is a
pretty decent gaming panel the only
thing holding it back really apart from
lackluster freesync support which again
wasn't really to be expected in the
first place is ghosting because the
response time the response time is
definitely not two milliseconds as
advertised but this is really only an
issue for fast paced games like
first-person shooters that have a lot of
movement and even still I was enjoying
myself playing doom and several matches
of csgo where I kind of forgot about the
ghosting and it really just boils down
to the individual some people are more
sensitive than others so you're gonna
have to decide for yourself how
important that is but altogether I mean
I think it's a well-rounded gaming
monitor if you're looking for something
that's more portable and on the go that
isn't necessarily a full-fledged gaming
laptop the only other thing I would dock
you for in the gaming department is the
fact that you encounter screen tearing
quite a bit at the time unless you have
that sweet spot AMD GPU that hovers in
the 40 to 60 fps range and the majority
of titles you're gonna see some screen
tearing may I say though that having
screen tearing on a 13-inch monitor is a
little bit more tolerable because you
just can't see it as much so overall I
really like this monitor it's kind of
won me over the aesthetic is top-notch
the build quality is solid I love the
connectivity options the downsides
include a chintzy stand it sucks it's
really crappy the response time is leave
something to be desired maybe they can
improve upon that on a 2.0 model if they
really want to target this towards
gamers and then finally the weak free
sync range just left me thirsty for more
so altogether though fantastic display
I'll put a link in the description if
