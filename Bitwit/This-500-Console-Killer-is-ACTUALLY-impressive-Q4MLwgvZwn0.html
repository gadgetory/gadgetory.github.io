for around 500 buckaroos so it's a
little bit on the high inside it's
definitely a bit more than you would pay
for an Xbox 1x or ps4 Pro but at the
same time this bill should definitely
outperform either of those consoles with
flying colors
I should also mention this video is
sponsored by Aero cool so thanks to them
for providing the case as well as some
goodies we'll take a look at later but
let's go over the parts starting with
our CPU we've got a risin 320 200 G this
is a quad core for thread part boosts up
to 3.7 gigahertz and it does feature
integrated Vega 8 graphics so it does
have an eye GPU on there although we
will be adding a discrete GPU to this
bill but it is convenient to have
onboard graphics for a number of reasons
like troubleshooting or just having it
as a backup should your GPU die for some
reason with no immediate replacement
with some overclocking Headroom and
erase stealth cooler out of the box the
2200 G is quite a bargain for just a
hundred bucks we're pairing that with an
asrock V 450 mm HD V motherboard this is
a fairly basic board it only has 2 DIMM
slots that is the price you pay for not
paying a lot but for 60 bucks you're
still getting the B 450 chipset plenty
of USB 3 ports on the back and even an
m2 slot so it's already better than the
motherboards that Walmart used in their
gaming PC now the memory kit we're
supposed to be using for this build is a
16 gig dual channel kit of g.skill Aegis
ddr4 a 2800 speed but due to the
Christmas rush it has been delayed in
shipping and so it's not here yet so we
have a placeholder for now this is the T
Force Nighthawk RGB so it's 3000 speed
just a little bit faster than our Aegis
kit if the Aegis kit doesn't arrive here
by the time we're ready to test this
finish build that'll probably just down
clock this kit to 2800 and that'll be
the best I can do for now but we did get
that Aegis kit for 99 bucks so not too
shabby for a dual-channel 16 gig kit
moving on we have a corsair CX 450 watt
power supply which should be plenty of
juice for this build 80 plus bronze
certified fully black cables it's not
modular though so we'll have to do spend
a little bit more time with cable
management our video card is the power
color radeon RX 5 70 red dragon which
sounds like a model that while would
appreciate the RX 570 is a fantastic
entry-level card for gamers looking to
game at 1080p and I think I snagged this
one for about 145 bucks which is
definitely a low barrier to entry for
anyone looking to get their foot in the
door the PC gaming we have a couple
drives for storage including a 2
terabyte Seagate Barracuda 7200 rpm
mechanical hard drive that we'll be
using for our games and mass storage and
our boot drives a 240 gig silicon power
s55 two and a half inch SATA rev3 SSD I
was able to snag both of those for
around a hundred bucks total but if you
wanted to cut costs down even further
and you were okay with having a smaller
OS drive I think you can snag this s 55
in a 120 game capacity for like 19 bucks
and finally all of this hardware is
going inside of the aero cool Cylon mini
this is a micro ATX case that you can
pick up for 4045 bucks
and for that price you get RGB and USB
3.0 on the front panel a removable dust
filters and so forth again links to all
this stuff can be found in the
description below and thanks again to
Aero cool for sponsoring this video now
let's get building this 500 ish dollar
console killer
all right so the build is done and it
actually came out a lot cleaner than I
thought it would I was surprised how
well I was able to actually hide a lot
of the cables especially since we don't
have a modular power supply inside of a
40 $45 case like it looks really clean
from this side even the back side of the
cable management wasn't too bad
obviously if you have more devices
connected then things get a bit hairy
but for the most part building inside of
this thing was really no problem at all
as you can see we did not get the
g.skill Aegis kit in time we're still
using the T Force Nighthawk RGB sticks
and as I mentioned I have down clock
goes to 2800 speed which is what the
aegis kit was rated at it's also worth
noting that I've overclocked the Rison
320 200 G ever so slightly to 3.8
gigahertz on all four cores and I could
have maybe gotten away with a little bit
more but I didn't want to chance it I
forgot to mention this motherboard only
has a single 4 pin EPS connector for the
CPU power so didn't want to push it but
enough jibber-jabber let's see how this
thing games I've jumped into Doom as you
can see and we are using the Vulcan API
and yeah Vulcan on ultra ultra settings
guys 1920 by 1080 and look at that a
hundred and thirty hundred and forty FPS
not bad
GP is getting a little warm I'd like to
see it a little cooler than 80 the nice
thing about the system is that it has an
AMD GPU which means you could easily get
a free sync supported display that'd be
a lot cheaper than an equivalent g-sync
panel by the way sorry for the Cherry MX
blue switches that I'm actually clocking
on right now if it's a little bit noisy
all these peripherals in fact it is
including the gaming chair from Oracle's
sister brand that the right term sister
brand brother brand I don't to be
accused of being sexist
it is 2018 after all but all these
accessories are part of the Thunder x3
line this is the a k7 keyboard it's got
RGB lighting of course you can also
choose which Cherry MX switches you want
with the keyboard it's offered in a
variety of flavors and it also has an
included wrist rest which is pretty
comfy also comfy is the rm5 Gaming Mouse
I thought this mouse was gonna feel
worse because it's a pretty cheap Mouse
but
I actually really like the shape it
seems like all these peripherals have
some sort of teal accent on them and the
teal acts that you see on the mouse is
actually rubberized so it has a pretty
solid grip not to mention Imran switches
which feel great I'm shocked what kind
of frame rates were getting right now we
could probably scale up to 1440 and
still get over 60fps I'm gonna try it in
a sec the h7 is the headset that I'm
wearing that's got a detachable mic and
I have the volume really low right now
so I can actually hear myself talk on
camera but they're super comfortable and
they look pretty cool from what I can
tell on a little monitor there which is
of course the most important part of any
gaming headset all right while we're
loading here the chair also is very
comfy it's got adjustable arm rests and
stuff they twist and turn you can change
the height oh I'm already I'm already as
low as it gets and yes my feet can touch
the floor
shut up but all these accessories from
Thunder x3 are pretty darn affordable so
if you if you're on a budget maybe or
just looking to save some coin and you
really like teal check them out I'll
throw some links in the description
alright hold on let's switch this up
we're going to 14:40 baby aha just as I
suspected just over 60fps I'm really
diggin the the price to performance here
of this rig so far now granted this is
doom and the Vulkan API not every game
supports bulk and of course so why don't
we switch gears here
- maybe GTA 5 I always go to GTA 5
because it does a good job of taxing
both the CPU and the GPU it's also a
very scalable game so regardless of the
specs that you're rocking as long as
they're not super potato you can usually
tweak the settings enough to get the
game running smoothly so alright here we
go
graphics 1920 by 1080 we have MS AAA off
let's leave it off for now we'll turn
FXAA
off as well and we've got pretty much a
blend here it looks like the game has
already sort of you know configured the
settings that it thinks we should be
running at considering our hardware and
it looks like a mix of high and very
high settings texture qualities very
high shader quality shadow qualities at
high grasses at normal soft shadows or
soft
extended distance scaling hasn't been
turned on doll let's just let's just
jump in and see what we get Franklin
come on Franklin
holy moly are we really getting like
7080 FPS in GTA 5 I'm just gonna get
into the street into the thicker parts
of Los Santos see our performance holds
up there now be honest the game doesn't
look quite as crispy
let's say oh wow that was Wow
always look at the road when you're
driving let this be a lesson to all of
you as I was saying the game doesn't
look why it is crispy as it could
because we don't have any sort of
anti-aliasing enabled that's for sure
gonna tank our frame rate let's just see
what happens
did I mention the GP is not overclocked
well I did now I did max out the power
limit slider though just to make sure
we've got a little bit more juice
pumping through I'm gonna see what
happens if I turn MSAA on all right 2x
msaa enabled that brings us down to okay
so 2x isn't it's not a game it's not a
game killer but you can definitely see
that we've dropped maybe 5 to 10 FPS on
average but of course I personally like
the way msaa looks a lot more than FXAA
edges look at that sharper bit more
natural I feel like only the most
privileged and spoiled of gamers would
would scoff at the level of performance
that this $500 rig is pumping out right
now and I mean if you want to compare
how this looks right now to the console
experience in the same title it's just
it's just you can't you just can't even
compare it the difference is really
night and day and I guess the moral the
story here is that you don't need to
spend $1000 plus to get that experience
you guys let me know what you think I'm
sure you've already whipped up your PC
part picker lists and drop them in the
comments telling me what a terrible job
I did and how yours is much better
that's totally fine actually the more
options the merrier for anyone who's
looking to build something like this but
guys thank you so much for tuning in to
