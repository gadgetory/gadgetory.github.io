what's up guys so as most of you know I
don't typically feature smartphones on
the channel and this is mainly because
I'm personally not a big phone
enthusiast to begin with and even if I
was I don't really have many connections
with manufacturers in that arena which
makes review samples harder to come by
but since I recently picked up my new
Samsung Galaxy s6 for personal use I
took it as an opportunity to step out of
my comfort zone and try something new so
here's my first ever smartphone review
of the Samsung Galaxy s6 starting off at
the exterior Samsung brings an
attractive unibody design to their new
flagship model making it slimmer than
previous iterations at just 6 point 8
millimeters thin however for every
action is a reaction and the trade-off
here is the omission of a removable
battery or support for a microSD card so
you're pretty much stuck with the
device's internal storage offered in 32
64 or 128 gig varieties the entire front
and back of the s6 is lined with the
tough layer of Gorilla Glass 4 which
provides scratch and fall resistance
while offering up what I can only assume
is next-generation theft protection be a
gratuitous fingerprint tracking all
around the edges we get a chamfer piece
of metal that conspicuously lends the
appearance of the iPhone 6 I found that
the easiest way to tell them apart is by
their distinctive home buttons a smart
button layout aids the user experience
of the s6 with the power button on the
right being well within reach of your
thumb or index finger depending on which
hand you're holding it with and volume
up and down buttons on the top left
all of which feel very high-quality with
their clicky and tactile responsiveness
on the bottom is a 3.5 millimeter jack
micro USB port for charging and data
transfer and a speaker that gets plenty
loud at max volume without too much
distortion though it's not a
front-facing design having the speaker
pointed at the natural cup of your hand
actually helps protect the sound quite
nicely
coming from a samsung galaxy s4 mini
this is a much larger phone than what
I'm used to but the s6 still manages to
feel great in the hand thanks to its
rounded edges and solid weight just
south of five ounces at the same time
the super thin profile and glass backing
makes this one of the more slippery
phones I've almost dropped by times
needless to say sleeping it into a
trusted case with a bit more grip
instilled some confidence when handling
the phone on the back is a 16 megapixel
camera that extends a few millimeters
from the body leaving it slightly
vulnerable to damage so be sure to use
caution when placing the s6 down on a
hard surface just to the right of the
camera is your LED flash and a heart
rate sensor to patronize the deceased it
also acts as a shutter button for taking
selfies with the front-facing camera
further propagating the social trend of
self-sustaining narcissism on the front
you get a 5 megapixel camera up top a
seemingly durable home button and your
capacitive multitask and back buttons
which light up white for a second or two
when pressed the home button can do cool
things like open your camera from the
lock screen with a DoubleTap or unlock
your phone with fingerprint recognition
but the main event here on the outside
of this device is by far and away the
5.1 inch 2560 by 1440 Super AMOLED
display at 577 pixels per inch this
screen takes the crown for highest pixel
density currently on the market allowing
for crystal-clear video playback
stunning mobile graphics and super sharp
text with no visible signs of aliasing
color reproduction is top of its class
with vibrant hues that pop and deep
blacks that stay rich in low-light since
Super AMOLED displays are engineered to
better reflect light than their LCD
counterparts users will also benefit
from great visibility outdoors even in
direct sunlight while I could continue
raving about the eye googling display
there's an equal amount to be said about
what's under the hood
running the eye ops show is the Exynos
7420
octa-core processor at 2.1 gigahertz
alongside three gigs of ram and a mali
t760 GPU together this trifecta of
hardware makes for the most fluid user
experience I've seen on a smartphone yet
application load times are remarkably
fast including the camera and gallery
apps which were previously known to
cause hang-ups zooming and scrolling
operates without a hitch and just the
overall speed of this device really
allows you to be immersed in whatever it
is you're doing even after scouring the
UI for five straight minutes with the
intent of finding a chink in the armor I
finally gave up trying to induce a
noticeable stutter or slowed down
speaking of the you I baked into the
latest version of Android lollipop
aboard the phone is the latest rendition
of TouchWiz this time with far less
bloatware than we saw on the s5 while
this attributes to smoother and faster
performance all around aesthetically the
app icons look pretty basic and flat-out
boring then again there's nothing
stopping us from giving the launcher a
complete makeover by quickly applying
one of the many themes found in the Play
Store after adding some personality to
your device you can change up the
screens grid dimensions to better
organize your app icons into your
preferred number of columns and rows if
ever you should need to do two things at
once like watch a cat video while
creating your own meme first off
congratulations you win the Internet but
users with such tendencies will find
expedited productivity or lack thereof
with the multitasking ability carried
over from the galaxy note the stock
keyboard looks clean enough with a
decent layout and passable autocorrect
though I'd still recommend most Android
users head directly to the Play Store
and install Swift key or something
equivalent for a vastly superior touch
typing experience another buzz worthy
feature being heavily pushed by the
manufacturer is Samsung pay launching
later this year the mobile payment
service allows you to conveniently make
in-store purchases with your phone
though such services are the frequent
topic of controversy these days in
regards to their security and
reliability this is one area I haven't
experimented enough with to give my
proper take on circling back to the rear
facing camera the 16 megapixel sensor
sports an F 1.9 aperture and 28
millimeter focal length resulting in
crisp high-quality images an exception
here is photos taken in low-light
environments where graininess runs
rampant particularly when upping the ISO
apart from that the colors look magical
and being able to achieve a nice bouquet
will save you tons of time and Instagram
the camera is also incredibly responsive
with photos being snapped just
milliseconds after pressing the
on-screen shutter button you can also
use the physical volume buttons to snap
photos as well among the various
shooting modes there's a pro option for
photography enthusiasts with adjustable
settings like ISO white balance and
manual focus as expected you can also
tap to focus on the subject but I can
already foresee all the little extra
settings that pop up in pro mode
potential
getting in the way if you're more of an
auto user you'll be happy to know that
the auto focus on the Galaxy s6 is
faster and more accurate than it's ever
been letting you quickly point and shoot
with little effort in addition to still
photos you also get optical image
stabilization when shooting 1080 video
at 30 frames per second
though the feature becomes disabled when
jumping up to anything higher including
4k at 30 frames per second the video
quality here is superb not only in terms
of sharpness but accurate color
representation and even lighting nothing
looks blown out and image stabilization
performs its job well all in all what we
have here is a simple yet robust app
with a powerful camera to boot that's
arguably the best we've seen from
Android or Apple thus far and finally
let's talk about the elephant in the
room the non removable battery which has
been cut down from previous generations
is now just 25 50 milliamps I can't say
I'm impressed by the battery life of the
s6 nor am i outright disappointed by it
since I'm not really a power Android
user I can typically go all day and
still have about 20% battery life by the
time I roll into bed however I know many
folks use their smartphones
substantially more than I do and as a
result we'll probably have to rely on
the phone smart charging abilities to
get through their day with the galaxy s6
is fast charged support users can expect
to see 2 hours of HD video playback with
just a 10 minute charge and 0 to 50
percent battery life in just half an
hour a great solution for those on the
go wireless charging is exactly what it
sounds like get a wireless compatible
charger and juice of your phone simply
by placing it on the platform without
having to plug in any cables not only is
this incredibly convenient but having a
few of these place throughout the house
is sure to keep the s6 alive at home for
even the most aggressive users if I'm
speaking honestly here both these
charging solutions seem less like
next-gen features and more like
workarounds for the phone stunted
battery life but I suppose this is one
of the big compromises Samsung had to
make in order to get the phone as slim
and sexy as it is whether or not this
was a smart trade-off will largely
depend on the specific needs of the user
and I think that is all I have to say
about the Samsung Galaxy s6 and there's
really a lot of information here so just
to quickly sum up this is the fastest
phone I've ever come
cross watching it zip along to anything
I throw at it is truly a testament to
the matured internal hardware which
creates a fluid user experience on the
brilliant quad HD display Samsung Super
AMOLED technology delivers razor-sharp
text and breathtaking visuals that keep
your eyes fixated something I never
thought I'd say about a screen just
north of 5 inches new revisions to the
UI make it faster and functionally adept
with plenty of top-tier features that
make the s6 feel like a high-end product
the camera is awesome for Stills and
video with plenty of settings for
fine-grained tunability
though image quality and low-light could
see some improvement however this is a
seemingly small critique compared to the
questionable battery life while the
daily lifespan will suffice for most
it's a potential deal-breaker for power
users opposed to utilizing the phone's
various charging abilities as a crutch
these are likely to be the same folks
who struggle with the non removable
battery and the absence of any
expandable storage now be that as it may
this phone really pushes the limits of
today's mobile technology and having
been able to personally look past all of
its little quirks and shortcomings I'm
really looking forward to using it for
the next couple of years if you're in
the market for a considerable upgrade
I've give the s6 my recommendation in a
heartbeat well that is gonna do it for
now guys before you go toss me a like on
this video if you enjoyed it and let me
know what you think of this phone in the
comments also tell me how you think I
did on my first phone review on a scale
of awesomesauce to never do that again
did I mention I added a new shirt to the
store yeah there's a new shirt in the
store it's pretty cool if you buy one
I'm cat with awesomesauce Network thank
you guys for watching subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already and I'll
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
