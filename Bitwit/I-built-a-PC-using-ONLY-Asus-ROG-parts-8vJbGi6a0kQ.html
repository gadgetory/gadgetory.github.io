my desk it's also black and red and full
of ROG logos it's almost as if a
co-sponsor of this video in fact they
did
thanks Asus it's been a long time since
I've had this many high-end and unique
PC components on my desk at the same
time so I'm very excited right now this
is like the best Wednesday ever so
that's what we're doing today is just
cramming all these beautiful objects
together in hopes of turning it into a
functioning gaming PC we have a lot of
stuff going on here so let me just get
right into it for starters we have our
case the asus rog helix or helios let me
try that again
the asus rog strix helium's that sounds
better it looks like one of the towers
from Lord of the Rings we have these
amazing straps these very sturdy velcro
straps I thought these are gonna be
dinky when I first unboxed it but this
is actually one of the easiest cases
I've ever pulled out of its retail box
surprisingly for how large and heavy it
is the straps just make it really easy
to tote around it has a fantastic front
i/o with a four USB 3.0 type-a ports a
USB 3.1 gen2 type-c port also buttons
for fan speed and lighting control the
chassis features integrated addressable
RGB lighting particularly on the front
panel which is made of tempered glass
there's also tempered glass on both of
the side panels and they have two lists
release that's that's pretty pretty cool
it comes included with four 140
millimeter fans and it looks like we
even have a built-in GPU support bracket
to help eliminate GPU sag so we'll get
to test that out in just a bit as for
our CPU we have an Intel Core I 979 60
x16 core 32 thread CPU of course on the
skylake X platform it's an extremely
powerful but also very power hungry chip
but we've come prepared we have an asus
rog rampage 6 extreme Omega X 299
chipset motherboard EA T X form factor
it has an 8 phase power delivery
consisting of 16 different power stages
that are being driven by a pair of 8 pin
12 volt EPS power connectors we've got
an all aluminum heatsink cover onboard
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth even 10 Gigabit
Ethernet LAN built right in of course
the board supports quad channel memory
we have 8 ddr4 dimm slots supporting
speeds up to 36 hundred megahertz you
can push that even
if you're overclocking and will be
slotting in 32 gigs of g.skill trident
zr gb ddr4 memory at 3200 speed now if
the system isn't gonna be tricked out
enough we also have an asus rog or a
terminal which is their addressable RGB
lighting controller as you might expect
the device supports asus or a sync it
also comes included with two LED strips
but they've shipped over to additional
strips at 60 centimeters apiece as we do
have a lot of ground to cover inside of
our Ilyas now it's worth noting at this
point that if you're the jealous type
this video is not about to get easier
for you and that's because for our video
card for today we have the one and only
asus rog matrix platinum r-tx 20 atti
this is the card that they showed off at
CES that everyone was talking about that
features a built-in AIO they actually
caught the infinity loop cooling system
which has a contained mini radiator
water block and little integrated tubes
all inside of the GPU so you're
essentially getting liquid cooled or at
least hybrid performance in the size of
a standard air-cooled card it's the type
of product that nerds like us dream
about buying if we ever won the lottery
as opposed to going out and buying a
mansion in five cars we would buy this
it's seriously insane and I honestly
can't wait to play with it now having
super reliable power for an extreme
build like this is very important so
we've employed the asus rog thor 1200
watt platinum power supply it's a d-plus
Platinum certified as the name suggests
fully modular has beautifully sleeved
cables and we have that handy OLED
display that shows our power drop from
the wall our last asus component up here
is the rog ryojun 360 millimetre liquid
AO because why should our GPU have all
the fun and be the only one who gets wet
our CPU deserves some liquid love and to
especially for all the heat that it
outputs we have three beautiful Noctua n
ff12 fans that are extremely quiet and
very efficient at dissipating Heat the
unit also has a very attractive water
block with addressable RGB x'
customizable OLED screen and the list
goes on and on and then the final part
is a storage drive I save the smallest
for last this is a WD black SN 750 M 2
PCI Express 3.0 by 4 SSD and it's a 500
gig stick so we're just gonna be
slotting it in to our motherboard I
haven't decided where yet so many
options by
think that's everything Wow okay links
to all this stuff in the description
guys if you want to check it out - my
sincerest apologies to your wallets in
advance but holy cow I am super pumped
for this build I'm not faking an ounce
of excitement right now for the camera
I'm legitimately stoked to get this
underway because damn damn over here
lots of dam over here okay where do I
even begin right now
I guess CPU installation yeah I've done
this before okay let's do that
you know I think there's something to be
said about using components that all
come from the same brand or the same
gaming line it's not to say that you
can't make a beautiful system using a
mishmash mix of hardware but there's a
certain appeal here it's a very cohesive
look it's all coming from the same
engineers with the same design language
in mind it's a it's a thing of beauty
the other perk here of using all ROG
parts for example is that the lighting
just matches like the teal on the
graphics card is the same as the teal on
the LED strip is the same on the
motherboard because it's all again from
the same source
obviously the g-scale Graham doesn't
count but never mind about that
the other benefit is that the lighting
effects sync really well across all the
hardware I mean there's you can have a
build with you know twelve different
components all from different brands and
they're all supported by the same apps
you know gigabyte fusion asus or a sync
but that doesn't mean they're actually
gonna work together well in practice you
might have 80% of your parts that are
all doing the same effect that you told
it to but there's always those two or
three confused components that have no
idea what glowing yo-yo is and so they
start dancing to a different tune and it
completely throws off the vibe and
ultimately the appearance of your system
not here it's completely uniform and
it's awesome the other thing I'll
mention is up the Helios very nice case
to build in of course no case is perfect
it did have a couple shortcomings I
didn't like how many screws I had to
remove to get these power supply
basement pieces off and the cutouts at
the top above the motherboard could be a
little bit bigger maybe it's just my fat
fingers I'm not sure but overall
fantastic case lovely build experience a
lot of options so many options and room
for activities cable management is top
notch I'm sure you guys caught a glimpse
of the the backside it's not just me
yeah I know I do a fine job cable
management when I want to but the case
really may be easy the GPU sag bracket
is easy to use and it works you can see
that there's virtually no sag there well
there was a little bit of sag on the GPU
without it so it's actually kind of nice
that we're able to use it effectively
and of course the case just looks really
good with a system inside of it when
it's all powered on the LEDs at the
front are very seamless no hot spots as
far as performance goes I did overclock
or 79 60 X to 4.3 gigahertz on all fours
that was a really quick and dirty
overclock I probably could have spent
more time on it gotten a little bit
further but for the sake of the video
4.3 gigahertz on 16
mind you not too shabby my testing was
done in GTA 5 at 1440 P max settings
across the board I think I probably left
it running I jumped on the train so that
the train would just take me throughout
Los Santos without me having to use the
mouse or keyboard but I think I was on
the train for like three hours I came
back to look and CPU hadn't really
gotten much hotter than 60s it was in
the 60s I don't think I saw it in the
70s one time so that was really nice to
see of course 16-core is in the game
like GTA 5 it's not gonna be leveraging
all those course it's probably just you
know 90 95 percent of the time it's just
chill in there but still it was nice to
see some pretty decent temps there we
also have a 40 megahertz core clock off
set on the GPU so very small manual
overclock because the things already
pushed balls to the wall from the
factory but our clock speed was hovering
anywhere between 2020 100 megahertz
I also dialed in a 900 megahertz memory
clock just fine within the three hours
of GTA 5 mind you both side panels all
side panels were installed on the case I
think I didn't see it get much hotter
than 68 degrees Celsius that was as hot
as it got now of course there's a fair
chance you would see lower temperatures
if you threw a custom loop onto this GPU
but that defeats the entire purpose of
this product which is to contain
everything into the form factor of a
single graphics card no external
radiator pump reservoir tubing so
considering what they were trying to
achieve with this product I think they
did a pretty good job and the
performance is nothing to scoff at I
think I did ran I ran firing extreme
fire spring Xtreme got 17,000 278 on the
overall score and 17,000 746 on the
graphics core so wow this thing is a
beast and it's very quiet it's extremely
quiet I don't know if they use an OEM
for the fans or because I mean there are
OG branded fans I forgot to ask or look
at the reviewers guide what kind of fans
they are but they're damn quiet and I
just got them plugged into the built-in
fan controllers on the low setting of
course but temperatures again are good
enough to not need to go high and yeah
it's pretty much all I got to say it's
pretty sweet build guys let me know what
you think about this thing and if you if
you subscribe to the idea of using
components from the same brand or the
same gaming why do you generally try to
stick to complementary parts for your
builds or does it not matter much let me
know down below and what else
