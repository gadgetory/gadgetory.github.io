five six seven years old even like this
one here you might be at a fork in the
road deciding should you build a new one
from scratch or should you spend some
money on it and upgrade it well there
are pros and cons to either of those
paths but today we're gonna be exploring
the latter and seeing what the best way
to go about upgrading this system is in
hopes of transforming it into a
relatively decent gaming PC I mean it's
really easy to throw a bunch of money at
a system like this in hopes of making it
faster but if you don't know exactly
which areas could use the most
improvement then you could be wasting
your money at the same time so hopefully
I'll be showing you guys how to get the
most bang for your buck when upgrading
an old desktop like this speaking of
which this is the Dell Vostro 470
pre-built desktop
I bought this recently on Craigslist for
a hundred and fifty bucks this was the
same rig that was featured in my gtx
16:50 video go ahead and check that out
if you haven't yet but this is actually
a pretty solid build especially for the
price I paid for it we have a core i5
3450 that's a quad-core CPU for logical
cores turbos up to 3.5 gigahertz of
course it's a little bit older third gen
Ivy Bridge but it's honestly not too bad
for a gaming CPU here in 2019 we have
eight gigs of system memory in a weird
configuration we have two two gig Stix
and one for gigs pic of different
frequencies and we'll talk about that
more later there's a single 750 gig 7200
rpm mechanical hard drive with our
operating system and pretty much
everything else on it ad√®le 350 watt
power supply and no discrete GPU you can
see that's just integrated graphics
we're running off of Intel HD graphics
so goes without saying that when I first
got this rig on day one it could not
gain worth a damn what's important to
note here though is that the system has
good bones it has a lot of potential and
room to grow the CPU and the motherboard
the platform in general is pretty strong
still so we don't actually need to swap
out anything in this build I'll only be
adding parts to it which is gonna save
us a lot of coins and I mean you could
argue that if you're swapping out the
CPU and motherboard you're essentially
building a new PC anyway so the other
thing is that bringing that cost down
not having to replace anything just
adding to it also keeps us from spending
too much money on this really old system
I mean we want to bring it up to speed
and all but you don't want to dump more
money into it than it's really worth
with that said the first thing I
upgraded was the graphics now if you're
trying to upgrade an old system like
this and you don't
about gaming then you can probably skip
the video card upgrade altogether
because it's really the main benefit
that it's offering but if you are trying
to do some gaming with your old
dilapidated machine then dropping in a
discrete GPU is probably one of the most
sensible things you can do for the
system but there's a couple things that
we have to bear in mind before we decide
to throw in any old GPU because not any
old graphics card is going to work for
starters the computer case needs to be
able to fit the actual card physically
so the first thing I looked for was PCI
slots at least two of them on the back
of the case because we have a two slot
design card and then I did a quick test
fit to see if we had enough clearance
for the length of the card as that's
usually the dimension that runs into the
most problems interference wise
fortunately our card fit no problem so
the next thing on our checklist was the
motherboard and whether or not it had a
PCI Express slot at least for modern-day
GPUs are gonna need a PCI Express slot
whether its Gen 2 or Gen 3 shouldn't
matter too much
fortunately our h77 Express board does
have a PCI Express slot the last thing
you ought to check for video card
support is the wattage of your power
supply to make sure that it actually has
enough watts to drive the card if you're
not sure you can look up the minimum
required power supply on the
manufacturers website and also that it
has the physical connections or plugs in
order to drive the card so our card our
rx 570 has a single 610 PCIe connector
and fortunately we have exactly one free
PCI Express connector coming from our
power supply so we're pretty much good
to go for our GPU a particular brand of
rx 570 is the sapphire pulse ITX and I
picked it obviously over the GTX 1650
because a it's about 10% faster on
average and B it's much cheaper in fact
it's a lot cheaper if you're ok with
going second hand because the rx 570 has
been out for a lot longer than the
recently launched gtx 1650 which means
it's really easy to hunt one of these
down for a good price in the second-hand
market i actually got mine on ebay for
$85 so that was just a Buy It Now price
I didn't have to bid for it or anything
that's almost half the price of a GTX
1650 brand-new so I was pretty happy
about that the next thing I upgraded in
the system was memory we have eight gigs
like I mentioned which is fine for a
super budget entry-level machine but if
you want to do any kind of multi
asking or if you just want a little bit
more breathing room having more than
eight gigs is certainly helpful here in
2019 upgrading the memory makes a lot of
sense here because there's such a broad
range of benefits that go far beyond
gaming pretty much everything you do
with a computer you know running tasks
and stuff eats up a certain amount of
RAM so whether you're gaming or not
having additional system resources in
the form of memory is going to benefit
the system overall now just like the
video card you have to go through a kind
of compatibility checklist as well so
the first thing is does it have an empty
dim slot for you to populate and is it
the right type the memory on this
motherboard or that supported by this
board is ddr3 and sure enough we have
one spare ddr3 dimms slot open now if
you're replacing all the memory modules
with new sticks then capacity is not too
big of a concern just by the amount of
RAM that you need and you should be good
to go
but if we're adding to existing Ram
modules like we are today then you might
wonder if you need to match the same
capacity of the existing sticks the
short answer is no you don't really have
to for example in a weird configuration
like this where we have two two gig
sticks and one four gig stick for I mean
for starters they're already not
matching and the system runs perfectly
fine but you could easily put an eight
gig stick in that fourth slot and
everything should work without a hitch
what you should look at more closely
than the capacity of the modules you're
upgrading is the speed or the frequency
because at the end of the day your
system is going to run all of your
memory sticks at the speed of your
slowest stick so for example our four
gig stick here is rated at 1600
megahertz and our to two gig sticks are
rated at 1333 what that means is the
system is gonna run all three of those
sticks at the lower 1333 speed so this
is gonna factor into your buying
decision because you don't want to spend
extra money on a faster stick when it
might be running at a slower frequency
anyway so something to bear in mind
could save you some additional coin and
for our purposes I purchased an 8 gig
what was it a time tech I've never used
this brand before I hope hopefully it
doesn't die on me it's an 8 gig ddr3
module at 1333 that I picked up for 30
bucks so relatively affordable again
going for dirt cheap upgrades here so
even though we're still gonna be running
all of our sticks at that lower speed of
1333 we'll now have 16 gigs of usable
memory
that's gonna give us a lot more freedom
with how we use our rig the last
upgraded part that I threw in the build
was an SSD and I'm sure a lot of you
guys saw this coming because booting off
of the spinning rust mechanical hard
drive is painful
it's just painfully slow these days I
mean booting a slow load times are slow
everything just feels bogged down and
SSDs are super cheap right in-house so
it's hard to justify not adding one to a
system like this plus it's kind of like
memory in the sense where it just speeds
up your overall system essentially your
system just feels much faster all around
now SSDs today take on many different
form factors but if you're gonna be
upgrading a system like this I would
highly suggest going with a two and a
half inch SATA based SSD a because
they're really cheap that being said you
can find you know em two drives that are
that are super cheap nowadays too but
there's a much higher chance of
connector compatibility and inform
factor being supported with an older
system if you're using a SATA drive so
we actually do have a free SATA port on
our motherboard for the transfer of data
and we have at least one free SATA port
coming off of our power supply for power
so that's pretty much it it's a fairly
slim checklist to see if an SSD is right
for your old build however it's also
worth checking if the chassis has
mounting points for a two and a half
inch drive if it doesn't it's not
necessarily a deal-breaker because SSDs
are so thin and relatively small
especially if you get some adhesive
velcro you can pretty much stick it
anywhere you want and since SSDs don't
have any moving parts you don't have to
worry about it being completely fixed to
the chassis in case it moves around it's
not going to get damaged or anything
like that so I did in fact yet a two and
a half inch SATA based SSD I went with
the Patriot memory burst
120 gig capacity of course capacity is
going to be up to you for the most part
make sure at the very least you have
enough for your operating system and at
least a few frequently used applications
but I got this drive for just $20 on
Amazon I believe so that brings the
total cost the total cost of this entire
system with the upgraded parts to 285
dollars which is right in there in terms
of console killer territory I mean I
don't
are there any consoles better that cheap
or cheaper I don't really keep up with
console prices but I typically consider
as a three to four hundred dollar range
to be
console killer territory and this goes
well blow that at just 285 so very
impressive and also goes to show that
you can build something like this if
you're comfortable with buying from a
secondhand market as most of these parts
are pre-owned guys if you want links to
the upgraded parts I'll put them in the
description if I remember but I think
without further ado we can throw those
parts back into the system fire it up
and see what it's like the game on this
thing alright it's looking really good
the system's booting in like a third of
the time that it took with the
mechanical hard drive it's super fast
and obviously the whole system feels a
lot snappier program is just launched
like that and we're getting into games a
lot quicker too everything's looking
really good we booted with 16 gigabytes
of system memory no problems there so we
have a bit more overhead now I don't
have ran anxiety anymore and of course
our RX 570 is doing a bang-up job it's
pairing really nicely so far with our
core i5 Ivy Bridge quad core CPU and I
tested four games so they were doom and
csgo both of those were running at max
settings or ultra if we're talking about
doom Resident Evil 2 the remake that was
tested at high to very high settings
across the board and then we had shadow
of the Tomb Raider which I had to dump
down to low settings because that is by
far the most graphically intensive game
on this list
it also means we were nearing console
territory with the the graphical
fidelity in that particular title
whereas all the other games looked extra
crispy which was really nice to see all
the games saw well over 60 FPS on
average there were a couple exceptions
csgo was more like 100 to 200 FPS
because it's not super demanding and in
shadow the Tomb Raider there was this
one little area that just completely
crushed the game it was getting like 22
FPS at some point it was very brief but
it did happen and it wasn't pretty the
rest of the time though all the titles
ran beautifully including Shadow the
Tomb Raider it was just kind of amazing
that I was gaming on the seven-year-old
Dell pre-built that had just been given
a little bit of TLC and could not
distinguish it from say a five six maybe
even a $700 gaming PC doom was the
biggest memory hog out of the four it
ate up nearly
seven gigs of system memory and that
would have been an issue had we only had
eight gigs of RAM in here but bump it up
to sixteen gave us peace of mind and
additional Headroom so that if we wanted
to do some multitasking in the
background we could easily do so now
probably goes without saying that our
case for the Dell Vostro here is not one
of very thoughtful airflow
there's only one exhaust fan at the rear
it's 80 millimetres no other fans in the
entire chassis and the ventilation slots
the front here are extremely limited and
sort of closed off so I was actually
happy to see there are temperatures for
CPU and GPU didn't suffer too badly our
CPU is getting anywhere from the 50s 60s
which is not too shabby and our GPU
hovered comfortably in the 50s and 60s
and I think into the 70s for Shadow the
Tomb Raider it was also nice to see
virtually no CPU bottlenecking
especially because we're talking about
an older CPU that's an Intel Core Ivy
Bridge processor third gen from years
and years ago and our RX 570 isn't a
brand new card or anything it's been out
for a while but it's certainly more
recent and newer than our CPU so it's
nice to see the CPU keeping up just fine
certainly a testament to the strong IPC
of Intel Core processors even in their
early days in fact we we stayed GPU
bound more or less the entire time as
you can see from the clips here our GPU
civilization was that 100% more or less
the majority of time but that's it $285
console killer what insane what crazy
value oh my god yeah you know it's not
pretty okay it kind of looks like my
butt hole at the same time this has to
be the best bang for the buck system
I've ever had the privilege of working
on at least in the top two maybe top
street cop to at least top two you know
if you're gonna take a lesson away from
this video it would be that if you have
an old aging dilapidated rig maybe
consider checking out the second-hand PC
market before you take it to your local
waste center you never know what you can
find so guys I hope this video was
somewhat interesting maybe a little
informative and let me know what you
think down it comes below thanks for
watching pass a like on it before you go
get subscribe for more tech stuff coming
at you really soon buy a frigging shirt
screw with confidence right now cool I
love hats that's my best Lyle
impersonation that I've ever done it
probably can't get much better than that
he will be very offended that I just did
that but I'll drop a mercy link in the
description or you can just head the bit
with tech if you're interested guys
thank you so much
have a good one and I'll see y'all in
the next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
