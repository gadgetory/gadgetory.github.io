channel today we are having some fun
with the GTX 1080 in particular we're
running it against doom in 4k this is of
course doom 2016 from Bethesda that just
launched earlier this week we're going
to be running that game again in 4k at
completely maxed settings so every
quality setting in this game is going to
be turned to 11 so to speak
and we're going to see exactly how much
or how much mileage we get out of a
single GT X 1080 overclocked and I have
the overclocked settings right here
we've got EVGA precision X and you can
see here I've dialed in a pretty decent
offset for our GPU core clock at 220
megahertz and 90 megahertz for our
memory clock offset and that gives us
about two hundred and thirty seven point
five megahertz for our core clock and
five thousand and ninety four point nine
megahertz for our memory clocks so
exciting stuff all around I'm going to
go ahead and jump into doom actually
before I do let's say let's take a look
at the video settings that I'm using
again we're at 4k right here and vsync
is of course off we've got a txt SSA a
pretty much every setting that you can
max out I have done so so we've got like
lights quality at Ultra shadows quality
on nightmare occlusion quality on high
and decal quality on ultra anisotropic
16 X even though that doesn't really
affect performance at all
we've got virtual texturing page size on
nightmare which is just a cut above
ultra of course and we've got ultra
reflections ultra particles and all that
good sort of thing ultra motion blurring
and whatnot so on that note why don't we
go ahead and jump into the game now of
course I have played this game for about
10 to 15 minutes maybe 20 minutes maybe
25 minutes just starting out to get a
feel for all of the key layouts and
whatnot but I am still by far and away a
doom noob so please forgive any kind of
horrible gameplay that you're about to
see I'm gonna go on the hurt hurt me
plenty option because I can't really
handle anything more than that I'll just
be dying left right and that doesn't
really make for good content so just
bear with me
I can't I'm not quite ready for the
nightmare mode just yet of course in the
top right corner you can see our FPS
counter and more more metrics there so
you can follow along as we play the game
alright
strap in what do we got what do we got
let's see what hell's like some some
douchey tribal tattoo I knew a new a guy
in college with that tattoo on his arm

any other takers mother effers yes what
that is what that yeah alright shit well
that is doom at 4k max settings everyone
on the GTX 1080 overclocked hopefully
you guys got a kick out of it as you
could see I was hovering around anywhere
from 40 50 potentially 60 FPS all around
but as far as my personal experience
goes it was very smooth I wouldn't have
even noticed the difference between you
know sixty and eighty FPS I'm just that
type of person where I don't really
notice the intricate details some of you
guys might have just easily been able to
tell like right off the bat oh this is
clearly not above 60 FPS consistently I
however was having a blast playing the
game it felt super smooth to me as I was
playing on 4k this was a very smooth and
consistent experience that it's very
impressive actually so congrats and
kudos to the folks at Bethesda and Ed
for developing a very well optimized
game very happy about that but guys let
me know what you think of this type of
content in the description or in the
comments below I should say also feel
free to toss me a like on the video if
you enjoyed it stay tuned for more tech
content coming at you really soon and
until next time I'll see y'all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
