a quick unboxing and overview on this
external hard drive enclosure from
Roseville this is the rx 3 5/8 u3c
in black alright so upon opening up the
box you find the user's manual we've got
the hardware I'm sorry the drive
enclosure itself which I'll get more
into in just a second
looks like they've individually wrapped
the backplate enclosure got some
mounting screws to Matt your 3.5 inch
drive pedal wall adapter here this is AC
power to power your enclosure and your
hard drive and what if I mentioned this
before but this enclosure is USB 3.0 and
eSATA compatible so there your USB 3.0
and eSATA cables taking a closer look at
the front of this enclosure you can see
that it is made of a black aluminum
there's the ROS little logo right there
you've got a mesh grille just above that
18 millimeter fan the fan by the way is
set to intake so it's gonna be grabbing
a bunch of drawing cold air from the
outside and pulling it in directly over
your hard drive on the sides we have ABS
plastic construction and on this side
we've got another mesh grille just to
aid in air flow for your hard drive and
on the opposite end of that we have some
ports and switches so right here we've
got your 12 volt DC power in USB 3.0
port right there your uh this is a
switch to turn your enclosure on or off
so it's either gonna activate or
deactivate your hard drive I've got a
fan switch 4 on or off and lastly you've
got an eSATA port if you take a look on
this side you can actually see the
inside of the enclosure by the way the
backplate is right here and it is also
just like the front made of black
aluminum so there's a better look at the
80 millimeter fan and you got your
circuit board right here if you take a
close look you can actually see that it
is in fact a SATA connection mounting a
drive in this enclosure is fairly easy
make sure your back plate is removed
then go ahead and slide your 3.5 inch
drive directly under that serial ata
dock then you can proceed to sliding off
the side panels of your enclosure and
that's going to reveal the mounting
points for your hard drive so take those
mounting screws bolt them down and make
sure that your hard drive is secure
slide the side panels back on and secure
them with the included screws and lastly
you're going to need to mount the
backplate to the
with the remaining screws all right guys
so I have the enclosure all set up here
it's currently connected to my computer
via USB 3.0 and I've got a 2 terabyte
Seagate hard drive in there seems to be
working just fine I can barely hear the
80 millimeter fan it's like really just
inaudible pretty much it's really quiet
and one thing I wanted to point out also
is that this enclosure does have two
blue LED indicator lights but that's
gonna do it for this video guys once
again this has been the Roseville rx 3 5
8 u 3 C external hard drive enclosure
thank you all for watching this video
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
