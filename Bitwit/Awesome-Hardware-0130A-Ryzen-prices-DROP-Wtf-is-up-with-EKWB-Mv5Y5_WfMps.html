random number out of my ass that was a
quite random yeah I was like well you've
really calculated this down to the wire
you know when you when you do this when
you do this for long enough you start to
learn these things a little nuances mhm
helps you goodbye I used to know the
delay between twitch and YouTube or
twitch versus YouTube whenever we stream
to them but now I've forgotten you did
yes well we striven to both now yay
alright then let's start the show
welcome everyone this is awesome
hardware episode 130 130 whoo sorry
side a which means side B will be on
Paul's channel if you're watching this
on YouTube you're obviously at my
channel right now you can go ahead and
head over to youtube.com slash Paul's
Hardware after this side is done I've
also put a link in the description below
if you're watching on twitch just stay
where you are the entire stream will be
streamed right here
that's why twitch is awesome but this is
a live news show tech news show where we
have a variety of things that we talked
about including tech news obviously I
would like to have a few beers
occasionally we use adult language so if
you have little ones around be sure to
hide your wife hide your kids hide your
kids hide your wife yes and yeah it's
it's gonna be a fun show this is the
live stream before Thanksgiving so yeah
excuse to all of you who might be out
celebrating or about to celebrate with
your friends family looking forward to
eating lots of food yes gonna be great
yes the next next week's show Paul and I
we won't recognize us because we'll be
about 20 pounds heavier but that's all
gravy because as a result of the great
oh yeah there's a loose connection there
I didn't really plan it down all the way
but that's okay
thank you show join us cheers Cheers
fear of legal drinking age if not just
just be patient it'll come um we're
waiting for yes so I guess we can just
divert it in well we do have some things
to sell as always we're always trying to
horror ourselves out in the betterment
for the betterment of of ourselves my
store is big with tech slash store
because we're parents
there's a clearance sale that's
screaming text at the top sorry yes it's
very loud and obnoxious we'll try to
will try to tone it down on the font so
that we use all caps the CPU hoodies
yeah maybe try blends people have been
complaining about the blatant
advertising but yes the beautiful
sweater this fine CPU cooler get it
hoody get it now get get one of
everything got the the pocket right
there for years got a kangaroo pouch
baby kangaroo yeah to it an exit and an
entrance
Paul's store is Paul's hardware net is
he's still selling all the same things
including the new bottle opener and mug
and other fangs
I got a sale going on the on the thumbs
group pullover hoodie right now this is
this is a very very nice hoodie mmm you
guys if you're into it do you have one
of that what what do you have one year
saw I don't have the pullover as a zip
up okay I'm but I don't even have one of
my own sweaters yeah you should get it's
it's it's only winter is here it is in
California for what for whatever then so
that's good to have a good head yeah
that's true
then traveling east I'm Haley recommend
the new 15 ounce mugs four ounces more
than the previous mugs yep more is
better more these bottle openers are
awesome yes I like those a lot actually
okay do we have any announcements it
doesn't look like it from the doctor we
ensure that they should start announcing
right we can I think you mentioned this
last week but we're gonna be doing a
charity livestream it's gonna be on
December 9th I'm pretty excited Saturday
and we're gonna stream for about 12
hours and we're gonna be raising money
for charity and if you donate you you
could you could have a chance to win a
pretty awesome computer from either of
us yes so that's gonna be cool yeah set
calendars will give you some more
details as far as when it's gonna start
and stop and that kind of thing yeah at
that date it'll be fun a later time
it'll be super fun and dig maybe well
maybe we'll try to maybe we'll open it
up to see if people want to join us for
gaming or whatever I mean we're gonna be
playing for 12 12 hours we have
time to do everything we have time to
play every single game yeah we should
start by completing all the Final
Fantasies and just work our way through
our steam libraries yeah each of our
respective one of the time in libraries
and probably get through it every Humble
Bundle game I've ever purchased will be
played on stream okay can't make that
promise but um I'll I'll join the
floatplane when Linus kicks off his ass
comes back I'm gonna come down here to
California well he's gotta say very very
nicely to me Paul will you drum
join the floatplane and here is $10,000
that's I think the 10,000 would probably
be easier for Linus than to actually be
genuinely polite to you that's probably
true 10k but do I really have to say
please I guess if it comes down to it if
I got one or the other I would probably
give it serious consideration but you
know both of them and it's an obvious
yes an obvious yes of course well we'll
see if he follows through all right
well ladies and gentlemen why don't we
go ahead and kick it off with some hot
and heavy hardware it's about to get hot
yeah I do
by the way I'm I kind of feel like we
should update the hardware yeah does
that r9 290 this is heading 270 yeah
it's just very single fan is 600 watt I
can't I mean it kind of makes sense cuz
that is hot and heavy hardware that's
true right and we got hot on the left
all right never mind it's fine we're
leaving it as is no need dump great what
are we talking about so first off we've
got a couple GPUs to note first of which
is the EVGA kingpin GTX 20 TI which just
launched hey sorry that was my brand new
pixel 2 going off let me just put that
on Sam oh yeah camera working on that is
it yeah oh yeah everything's working
everything's working just have a
functional camera on your pixel to
functional camera the Wi-Fi works unlike
my old phone that's good and it doesn't
reboot every 15 minutes
yes my favorite feature on the new pixel
- you actually had a pretty good reason
to get a new phone I really did but it
was unusable my regular pixel which I'm
still using my standard pixelated ears
is still perfectly fine I really did not
want to upgrade I don't and then not
wanting to have $1000 that I briefly did
not have which I treated yes there's a
whole video documenting this oh boy
you're gonna want to one-up me with the
finish on the back and how it's like
that's why you're so gracefully touching
it have you all right so do you use the
squeeze thing I haven't used that yet
that was that's if you're gonna take me
a while to get used to it and also like
how does it how the hell does that work
right like cuz there are no actual
physical buttons oh jesus no it's
trekking my every word you activated the
damn Google assistant now it's gonna
search from this entire monologue okay
I'm gonna stop now now I gotta unlock it
weird that's what happens said people
can't see oh geez somehow Aziz Ansari's
monologue on Saturday Night Live's
transcript popped up thank you google
assistant Google always knows they are
so right on top of things alright
getting back to yeah come on nobody
watches this show for the random silly
tangents they just want the to the cold
hard facts Paul look a single is dead
singers 1080i yeah it's a single slot
which is sort of unlike a lot of other
high-end GPUs these days that come pre
fitted with water blocks single slot but
they managed to actually put a decent
amount of Io on there including three
mini display port HDMI and DVI ports I
should let everyone know right off the
bat this is probably obvious but just in
case you're thinking about buying one of
these things it's twelve hundred and
fifty dollars pretty steep
and it's it's really targeted at extreme
overclocking extreme overclockers so
yeah bear that in mind
EVGA is guaranteeing a 2025
megahertz 2025 megahertz overclock which
isn't ridiculously high we've definitely
seen that habit he said I push what well
past that but then again this is Darren
doesn't that guarantee nice very lesions
which usually means that it can go to go
well past that yes single slot water
block it's got the icx sensors you got
nine sensors not just one on the GPU
like most GPUs come with but you've got
some on your memory and your vrm as well
and an additional one under GPU voltage
measurements measurement points and full
cover backplate which looks pretty nice
it's a ten plus three phase design and
that's via two 8-pin connectors we've
also got some information that you can
order it directly from the EVGA store I
don't know I'm pretty sure this isn't
that Bond Amazon or new egg yet so you
probably have to buy it from EVGA direct
but I think James did a video on this
know not too long ago he did one on the
king pin which they overclocked would
they did LNC Mellon - overclocking with
but then this is the standard copper
model of that so I believe yes this is
not the same PCB exactly yeah
and but this one comes with like the
single slot bracket and everything
mm-hmm and the other one comes with a
single slot bracket - but not the single
slot cooler right and just to reiterate
this is e BGA's highest end card at the
moment it's the best at least one that
they've actually designed in-house you I
wouldn't count like the the reference
Titan XP that they just slapped with her
name on although did did add board
partners do their own branded reference
models for the Titan XP not allowed -
okay okay
no Titans just protecting it oh no
Titans okay Titan the Titans I mean
other than a couple of the water-cooled
versions is that EVGA did there's no
okay no specially designed Titans then
it definitely undoubtedly is is their
highest end card yet so go buy one
goodbye to
alright moving on there's another GPU oh
yes beer beer let's open up some we
share because we had this makes me
nervous why don't you open that so it
says a little twisty thing here you got
to twist it off like this I don't trust
those then now that seems sketchy you
should never have to twist any should
always be very careful where you point
us through these were you very they can
pop out right in your eye just right in
your eyes last second ah no no no cuz I
feel like did ever even know what is
gonna happen I feel like it happened to
me once already so it's very possible
that would happen again I feel like I'm
just prone to cross that guy we're
drinking a Belgian a Belgian Tripel
today this is actually from Belgium and
seulchan triple Karim Elliot Karim
Elliot Carm Elliot term Elliot triple o
karma Lee sounds like caramel blonde
robust is smooth and fruity with a
delicate spicy flavour bottle
conditioned ale made with oats barley
and wheat a true three grey nail hundred
percent natural eight point four percent
alcohol by volume in case you're
wondering
so step down from what we've been
drinking recently we're getting bottled
by our brow Ridge blah steals kirk strat
96 Bugan Bugan out belgium Dara Dara
Sano and chat says this beer is so good
yeah that's that's what's Kobey's right
okay
alright no careful yeah just do have
like the slightest bit of PTFE just I
don't know like now they just make me a
little nervous it's not like it's a
problem doesn't affects my day-to-day
routine or anything but just seeing it
like a little halfway out and you just
leave smooth like that just knowing that
it could pop at any moment are we okay
okay alright let's see how come how come
on trees
here's here's the question now how come
the beer exploded all over me when it
popped cuz I didn't shake it I mean I
held the bottle just like you did I was
like showing it to the camera but I
didn't like turn it upside down has like
white with how it pops up I don't know
just honestly had it just been the cork
that popped out during that stream that
would not have made like an insanely
viral clip yeah yeah we just wouldn't
have the beer like made it you know what
you mean but I just I don't I don't
understand the physics of it because I
didn't really move the bottle at all
well when they stage and plan that whole
thing I think that was part of it that
we shook it up beforehand right so it's
still really funny reading the comments
I'm not on that clip on reddit or
wherever on twitch just be like this was
obviously staged and let me tell you why
I'm just like keep going huh yeah let me
hear it I love conspiracy theories so do
i all right all right we're ready to
move on Moore Show thank you much babe
when I cook done I can't actually pour a
beer sometimes you guys concentrate and
stuff so there you have it choose
everybody's cute mm-hmm well that is
really good
ooh whoa I like it I'm down dude
mmm let's super tasty that's risk is I
gotta think I gotta think about it
there's there's it's very complex first
you just like oh that's good but now you
know I have to now I'm I'm confused I'm
what am i tasting there's two is good it
has layers yeah it's like an ogre the
Shrek Rose bed yeah all right little yak
good old Shrek throwback all right
moving on to our second article here
geez getting way off task yeah this is
about power colors Rx Vegas 64 which has
been listed Oh
go from overclocked 3d net I forget to
mention that the last article on the
kingpin was from video cards - thanks
guys - this is overclocked we do that
and that's this was originally listed by
overclockers UK they spotted this guy
online with the nose up for sale listed
there right oh yeah what's that oh sorry
with a non-member sarpy but a price tag
of 589 . and 99 great or great british
pounds which equates is about 780
dollars USD which makes about make sense
it's a pre-order price though so this is
not a mess our p potentially the price
will go up i would imagine the preorder
price is gonna be lower two and a half
inch cooler or a two and a half inch
probably put two and half it's pretty
substantive it's a 2.5 slot that's
almost like a almost a third like it
yeah it looks like it's three and a half
slots yeah it might just be the angle of
that lick shirt massive it's got an
extended PCB in a triple fan cooler it's
got two dip switches one of which is for
switching between three BIOS files and
the other controls the lighting on the
red the red devil logo I don't know if
that just means you can do different
effects with the red LED or if it's it
doesn't doesn't mention RGB and I don't
know why it would be RGB because it's
primarily a red as black card yeah it
doesn't need to be so no issues there
it's just for the 170 mega Hertz boost
to the GPU base clock and a sixty one
megahertz boost to the boost clock so
it's gonna be faster out of the box than
reference rx Vega 64 in the core clock
frequency department however the memory
clocks are gonna be the same 945
megahertz same as the reference and
there's not much more information than
that it's gonna launch soon but we don't
have an exact date
I know power color actually hit me up
recently to see if I could review this
and I have not gotten back to them so I
don't know well I I feel like this
year's just been so relentless with GPU
and especially CPU launches that I'm
like tapped out especially in December
being already crazy month with I've been
turning
a lot of product review more offers and
stuff recently too but it's sometimes
it's nice just to work in what you want
to work in yeah absolutely
it's driving from Colorado to 40 or a
vlog of picking up your new pixel table
oh yeah yeah that's fun floatplane right
now just they're just just personal
pieces yeah I'll look into our our daily
lives nothing special except everything
yeah
all right moving on really quick our
agency of tech just saying that the Star
Wars Titan XP collector's edition cards
are now available in Jedi and Empire
flavors same specs as the regular Titan
XP but just different shrouds and be
interesting to compare cooling no one's
really talking about the cooling if the
cooling is exactly the same if it works
the same if the cooler is just as loud
I'd love to see you in this video though
I'd love to see you comparison there may
be all forked out the 1,200 bucks and do
it myself are you gonna get one I
honestly don't know I'm still trying to
get another two terabyte 960 pro into
the elite build I should just which is
about that price so I don't know if I'm
just about to drop you know to 3 grand
right now who's about the first one man
I just bought the first one straight up
and yeah yeah it was a it was a big
right off of that I mean these haven't
seen this video yet because this is what
happens when you turn it big when you
buy this graphics card what soon as you
install it you get this yeah amazing
cinematic that this is a hologram that
appears you actually get inserted vrv
via VR into this apparently that magnets
on the back and if you put them together
it makes a lightsaber a white lightsaber
we see the white light saber yet no I
think so there I think there is one in
love lower but I don't know enough about
it to say anything
yeah
University yeah I was gonna add to that
video and capsulated so Leah are you
really considering buying one I mean I I
was considering following up on my email
video asking them yeah honestly like
yeah I wouldn't be opposed to it because
the way I see it is like not only do I
get to do a random fun video on Titan X
P special edition Star Wars but I'll
just have a Titan X P yeah I don't have
it which I do I do not even have a
reference Nvidia never sent me or you I
don't have any things
a Titan expose my that was apatite next
best my pitch to them was like hey
NVIDIA I don't have any tightness yeah
maybe how do you expect me the Star Wars
stay next to you that would be a good
tech man I think would really fit me in
the channel have it no no response would
you get Jedi or Empire
just out of curiosity if they got which
one you want Paul what would you say I
think you know I think Empire just cuz
yeah I mean I think I've been you know
like meets my my my Halloween costume
and stuff I was kind of as kind of an
empire thing and mm-hmm and like you
know they're they're regular reference
cards which you know these obviously
different from better somewhat similar
to you you know I already have green red
I guess yeah but yeah that's true I
agree I think the red looks a bit meaner
on that card specifically that's why I
agree with the Empire's ideology also
I'm just pure evil okay alright moving
on to our last article here for hot and
heavy hardware just a brief announcement
that the asus rog Strix laptop that
features a risin 7 1700 a core 16 core
cpu and our x5 e is now available damn
holy smoly z-- 16 gigs of DDR for a 17.3
inch burp nice not a burp not a 17 inch
burp a 17.3 inch of 1920 by 1080
120 Hertz IPS freesync display
that's cool that's a good display it's a
good display specs it's a good display
my laptop display hold it together cap I
know I'm trying I'm really sure
someone someone twitch clip that's
serious serious serious show about
technology support there seems to only
be support for SATA 6g I'm about to SSDs
which I find fan of bizarre according to
what I could find in the article I don't
know I mean honestly 6g say that it is
fast enough for most people this is a
gamer laptop a gaming laptop anyway
doesn't say any mention of nvme support
yeah that's interesting I thought it was
weird I thought it was weird even though
it's a gaming laptop and it might not
need to be envy me like that a certain
workstation laptop would it's still 2017
this is a premium gaming laptop and I
figured that would have been supported
just a gripe there and it's got a hyper
cool duo copper cooling system that
seems like a term that a suits made up
which basically means that it's using a
combination of heat pipes and fans duel
fans to cool the CPU and GPU
independently no interesting to get some
thermals on that how innovative I think
the horizon 7 1700 though I think that's
a good that's a good chip for a laptop
like this because it's pretty fairly low
TDP 65 watts and it does a lot for its 8
cores while maintaining some decent
power efficiency Rx Vegas at 580 isn't
terrible it's interesting wonder if you
wonderful miners are gonna like buy
these laptops and like extract the Vega
5 eighties okay probably notify DS I
mean
dovie's just set up a bunch of laptops
for mining that probably wouldn't make
sense
cost-wise because you have to buy the
whole laptop every time yeah exactly
seems like a cool laptop nonetheless
let's see anything else gonna add to
that pump I think Texas from the article
I think it is good I think it's good
this laptop would you would you want it
over your existing razor blade that has
what is it skylake that you have with
the gtx 1070 I've I think so yeah yeah I
know I know exactly what's what's in
there I think you have the second night
this is like a larger size laptop a bit
and then stuff units got a 17.3 inch
monitor and stuff so I mean it's it yeah
they're they're different styles of
laptop yeah this I would totally want to
like bring the CES to do video editing
on I mean yeah I'm like that that'd be
awesome for yeah I've got the 8 core CPU
in there and stuff yeah yeah angry it
for like a laptop that you need to do
workstation II type stuff on or I think
getting here yes you can be definitely
better suited at his work then like a
sky like CPU just a bunch of Excel
spreadsheets over and over again 16
threads but I know I don't know what
people do is computers all right let's
move on to pit my PC thank you guys for
submitting yeah photos of your rig at
roms so that Paul and I can give you
some advice on them and we'll try to be
trying to be nice you know we haven't
done let's put my PC in awhile
what's that it's a Matt Philly shoutout
vanish of a
yes Matt Philly we got the name Pitt my
PC from at Philly's Pitt my set up put
my set of his show right
he was an OG set up show by the way like
all of the set up shows that
now yes all just full-on cop cop is a
copycat of Matt Phil it's a big old bite
of Matt yep and they're just riding
riding that wave yeah
riding that that Mattie Matt Matt should
get like royalties for every set up show
in existence is reminded because you
know anyone who watches this ooh there's
like or he hates ostriches yes he hates
them right I could remember if he loved
them or hate it I think he hates them he
likes oh he likes her doesn't he
he's like he's gonna hard-on for
ostriches or he's like deathly afraid of
the big fan okay maybe he likes them I
know he likes Disney that's it makes
sense and this is his FX 8350 rig with
16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance lpddr3 with
the gigabyte rx 580 and Asus r9 280x so
he's got an RX 580 in here alongside in
r9 280x and resin asus is he mining this
rig or what there's nothing mentioned of
mining but it's always a possibility
he's got a cryo rig r1 ultimate which
okay he's updated the cooler I see it's
two different pictures here two
different is the cry rig upgrade okay I
you can't there's no way I mean you
can't possibly be cross firing these
it's not possible to my knowledge so now
it's you've got to be using one for one
thing and one for another potentially
mining I would say that that's good you
you you you can mine with several
different models of graphics cards at
the same time yeah okay just before I
have never mind before I don't know that
much about it so okay then maybe he's
he's a miner
that's my only assumption for based on
that cuz it's like he came yeah there's
a physics yeah actually he's in check
donjuan fantastic oh it's a mining card
for the 280 yeah there yeah it's so
handy when they're actually in chat -
okay can talk to us okay cool mystery
solved so
critiques here are gonna be cables and I
can't see if it's still routed this way
and this picture but you've got the
Supplemental CPU cable routed under the
graphics cards and up here kudos for
going under the graphics cards if you
got around it that way that is yeah you
know you tucked it to the left of the
BRM heatsink yeah but I mean if possible
it looks like you're really working with
a case that's pretty minimal when it
comes to cable management or that kind
of things so maybe a case upgrade should
should be something to consider here
yeah definitely beyond that I mean for
what you're working with that looks
fairly clean I mean relatively speaking
I would replace that CPU cooler
immediately but he did oh yeah he did
sorry I was focused so much on the right
make sure I already covered that
completely forget he even took the old
one and put it on top there's an emblem
so he remembers to never use an old an
old am 3cp
stock you see heat sink fan ever again
it's like he's just added to his
collection up there of things that are
useless full action happy gear and some
wire all right well I think besides
changing out the cables you could remove
the power supply sticker to give it a
little bit of a cleaner look and I mean
I guess the RAM is not garish or
anything but it's not really matching
with anything at the same time yeah so I
mean just it's like this isn't gonna
look anything other than like a pretty
you tilt the utilitarian PC build like
that but you know like we said kill
management is fairly clean for what
you're working with and it looks like
you're getting a lot of use out of that
system so I'd say I'd say more power to
you word xgm Thank You Jay we've got
angry Johnny angry John another theme
are we going with all AMD no I mean I
have my knowledge this is a queen king
but we have an FX 8350 here seventy
eight gigs of RAM GTX oh wait
know it he put 970 twice oh oh that's
the 917 gaming motherboard yeah that's
the chipset okay got it
um threw me out for a second and then
we've got a 120 gig SSD Corsair carbide
series spec 0 2 Corsair 8 105 extreme is
the fans are mounted outside on the top
of those I didn't notice that at first
thank you for pointing that out I didn't
either
Wow is that even making any kind of
direct contact with the radiator yeah
again I think so it's a thick radiator
so all he's going through is a single
you know steel and probably a couple
millimeter thick steel at the top of the
case so yeah that's that's there I mean
it's getting the job done I mean it
depends on what the ventilation at the
top of the case looks like I've this
this is innovation here Kyle this is
innovation that were looking at a level
that I think we have that previously
experienced on Pitt my PC and I think we
need to recognize that and applaud it ok
hold on yeah let me just take a look at
the top of that case it looks I mean
it's an exhausts but still it isn't
exhaust right but it looks like he won
the very top team this yeah that's an
exhaust no he knows he knows which way
to position the fans cuz he's got an
intake at the bottom that's a proper
intake and his front and takes her
proper front intakes so yeah he's got
him in pull which is you know that it's
it's it's a utilitarian I keep using
that word way to setup your all-in-one
cooler because you know the dust
collection will be here on the radiator
and you can you can go in there and
vacuum it off clean is that a dust
filter on top of the fans that is proud
that's like it and it's a metal as a
metal piece it's there for protection
for like cats and stuff because he
probably has cats so the cats would
would they try to walk on top of the
case unless it's a dust filter very it
looks like a dust filter from another
case but I could be wrong it looks like
because it's got like looks like I don't
know we only have one p.m. to go in here
you
making assumptions think you're leading
us astray
okay fine but let's see if there's any
but let's let's alright so I also want
applaud applaud the bold usage of the
just sort of electric blue cable
extensions here when nothing else in
this case is remotely near that color
and obviously those are cable extensions
which were put in like the you know you
don't it's not like you get a power
supply and then I go this has cable
extensions connected to it I guess I'll
just leave him there that like that
enough that was an active decision right
to put these cable extensions in here
and you know I think I think I like it
angry Johnny's in chat as well thanks
Johnny and I confirm the cat the the
cat's the fans are set to exhaust okay
but he does not have cats okay
completely wrong on that Pauly's man all
right I'm slipping I'm slipping here
Thank You Johnny back your together
right he obviously this is a setup to
confuse me yeah but yeah that'd be a fun
game again big fan of the electric blue
cable extensions trick Paul and I just
say I think I think the only thing you
should do is remove the sticker on the
side of your power supply
everything else should stay exactly as
is yes let's move on all right thank you
angry Johnny
Nomar no no no what Nami for one for
he's got an i-5 7600 K hyper 212 Evo
gigabyte Z 270 motherboard eight gigs of
Corsair memory a ZOTAC gtx 1070 240 gig
PNY SSD a two terabyte hard drive and an
EVGA 550 watt power supply this digging
that p400 yay oh this is an effective
build so like just just looking at your
part selection here this is a very solid
gaming system I mean this is various
this is this is pretty top of the line
right now yeah and you have a very
effective selection of parts here yes
from your mid-range but still very
effective d3 gigabyte motherboard to
your
Corsair 8 gigs of memory you know you
could upgrade that potentially but hey
you guys
for that in your motherboard so that's
your upgrade path right there 240 gig
SSD with a 2 terabyte hard drive I mean
can't get more budget-friendly as far as
price to performance than that 550 watt
PC which is kind of just enough to get
by with this rig yeah so there you go I
agree he obviously though you're
suffering from sort of the Flair yeah
you don't you don't have the looks tied
in here with the rest of your build if
you're interested I think the things
that you'd want to go for here to really
make this build look a lot a lot more
high-end would be a swap out of your CPU
cooler that's not to say that you don't
have a decent CPU cooler it's totally
fine swapping it out would be a purely
aesthetic decision but the hyper 212 Evo
just everyone knows what it is and it
just doesn't look all that great the
copper and the silver and everything
it's it looks very dated it's a very old
design but that with some cable
extensions would yeah and everything in
here Wesley if you have a look and you
have the form and the function yeah I
would say though but absolutely do not
do either of those things until you get
a second gig status most about to say
that because doing those both of those
things would be purely aesthetic and the
second a big stick in my rate would be a
much better choice I didn't even look at
the second picture cable management is
is fine yeah yeah mainly held back by
the by the ugly ugliness of the Paras by
cables yeah yeah really saw it built
that's good on my own I'm such excellent
component choice good cool moving on no
more giraffe giraffe trolls a nice draft
alright let's see we've got first build
its first built have mercy we shall not
have mercy on you oversee we there mercy
on no man so you've got there's no specs
here but we can see that we've got some
sort of a old motherboard an Intel stock
cooler it's an intelligent green it's a
green mother being PCB I'm kind of
wondering if this server board it's
either a server board or it's like
got maybe he got the core components
from the system like you Peapod a-- and
pre-built or something like that and
that's where he got the motherboard
people were saying it might be an OEM
board yeah it's possible
yeah the Intel stock coolers got to go I
mean it'd be it'd be better if we knew
what the specs worse and we could tell
you like if you need to upgrade the core
components now he's got a 960 and I'm 60
spine for 1080p I would say I mean it's
it depends on the games you're playing
if you want to start really hitting the
Triple A games there's some that you
know you're gonna be playing for like a
while then I would upgrade GPU I kind of
wish this picture was 3d because you bet
I better I bet this this the because
there's a daisy-chained extra PCI
Express six or eight pin sticking off
here in the middle but you don't really
notice at first but it's like it's just
it's there it's like hanging out in
space in the middle of the air Hey see
what I'm saying I'm talking about here
this is that this is this is a piece
like it comes over here and it plugs in
there and then the extra piece is just
hanging like out like this would be
coming out towards them right so I don't
see the actual connector which is weird
it must be like the casing the connector
right here oh wow I did not see that
that's a some reason it completely
blended in with the background I didn't
notice it first out of it yeah all right
so that's so weird so the OEM board here
is really throwing things off it's also
got a four pin supplemental CPU
connector which is in a really awkward
place right in the middle and that makes
everything look for the meaning for
there proven yeah we're in board and
your cable management just it looks like
it's very common for a first time build
you got everything plugged in and I bet
this perfectly functional but often
times the first time built get
everything plugged in so you know where
it needs to go and then realize you can
unplug things and replug them back in
and route them in a more pleasing
fashion or something that will give you
a little bit better
flow beyond that so yeah I'm not sure
how much extra space you have in that
case but for a first build well done
yeah and I'm sure this is a perfectly
adequate gaming rig yeah I mean
obviously there's a lot of things that
could be done but yeah that's that's the
upgrade path you have for the future
things things you can do next or beyond
that I'm losing my words next up is
Steven Kendall Sargento with the rising
builds at rising 5 1600 X MSI tomahawk
be 350 arctic motherboard 16 gigs of DDR
4 GTX 1066 Giga Samsung 840 250 gig SSD
Samsung 2 para 2 terabyte hard drive and
evj 750 watt power supply and a fan
Tech's enthu pro MSE case there it is
all black and white and pretty looking
everything looking pristine except for
that motherboard power connector
motherboard power connector looks
hideous
compared to the relative cleanliness of
the rest of this build if you're gonna
spend a little bit of money on an
extension for that which would really
clean things up I would say get a
matching one for your GPU at the same
time yeah you'll be able to get rid of
that extra little to pin kind of dongle
piece hanging off there which doesn't
look that great and that would really
kind of clean up this build a lot that
and removing the people to Braun SATA
cable up here no down at the bottom of
the motherboard of the blue SATA cable
yeah I don't mind the blue SATA cable
really I mean it's a lot less egregious
than the other things I think but it's
like it makes me does stand out it
forces me I notice it does stand out so
shouldn't notice it if you can get a
black or a white SATA cable that might
look a little bit better there and then
maybe wraps with some tape or do some
some some quick paint or something on
the top of this right here to get rid of
that little little color yeah and then
remove your power supply sticker and
you'll have a super super super clean
looking like a I wouldn't pick your
picture anymore
my CC because we can't say they do yeah
you're pretty much there but yeah all
those things and you have a really nice
clean build other than that very like
how we alternated the PCI slots that's
what I do for hot line
oh yeah I spray-painted half of them
pink oh you're right that looks that's
cool cool well Steven whatever your name
is jeez but thank you guys so much for
submitting those if you didn't happen to
get your wreath picked for this week we
will be doing this again so don't forget
all right let's move on to some tech
news all right let's do this a hit the
hard-hitting subjects the hard-hitting
topics starting with Rison and thread
Ripper prices dropping significantly oh
that's good news this is an article via
guru a new segment called good news good
news yeah right or or we need to do like
or or it could just be called actually
oh joy actually oh joy not-not-not
yes so this is uh this is pretty good
news for for us for everyone that risin
prices have been dropping em due to the
I would imagine
due to the the holidays and stuff with
Black Friday just around the corner but
we've got word that the risin 7 1,700
1,700 X and the 1800 X have dropped by
about 12% on average with the 1800 X now
being had for 439 bucks at us-based
Amazon and Newegg websites you know
obviously the chips launched originally
it's $4.99 and that's a pretty big
discount you're getting 60 bucks off of
an eighteen hundreds the 1700 x strap
from 399 originally to 349 50 bucks off
of that and then the 1700 which is my
personal favorite has gone from 329 all
already a great deal for this chip to
just $2.99
we've hit we've gone under $300 for the
risin 770 hundred
is awesome AMD 270 right now 270 right
now but what is there was your crappy
stories guru 3d reported it at 299 and
since then 1700s differently to India
another $30 did you get the 70 bucks off
TX I was assuming that 1950 X was gonna
be in there you didn't know I was I was
building up I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
saying we're talking about risin
non-threat River right now all right
finish the article and chiming fear will
add ons geez well wait what you've
already mentioned it the 1800 X is 3 20
bucks are you kidding me what okay
I looked earlier like this weekend it
was not that cheap so these prices are
just falling dramatically at an
exponential rate that's awesome
that's insane I might just buy one even
though I already tell them what how come
until never is just like our CPUs are
cheaper now right like they're not like
no a super user ever increasing in price
but man I spent $100 more on a 1900 X
third Ripper than this well you know I
don't know if it's necessarily up to in
teller AMD this could just be that is
the retailers and the retailer's don't
do significant price drops like this
unless they have promises from the
manufacturer all right sometimes
somebody is lying but typically they
have promises from the manufacturer that
they'll get some kind of rebate based on
how many to sell you're that kind of
thing a.m. and this is like a statement
from AMD any promotional deals or
special pricing on rising processors is
partner slash retailer driven within
their business okay
800 freaking dollars for the 1950 a 200
bucks off guys that's that's 50 note
that's 20% off that's right that's huge
all right we're shopping right now huge
that's huge
I wonder if Micro Center can be safe
anymore any motherboards are on sale oh
yeah you look good call tender for
motherboards MTR for boards no new AG
only and not all sellers shitty new we
don't want you so stupid the new AG
marketplace yeah
oh perfect I typed in
cylinder a PC case and you know what the
first look the first 10 things were some
 marketplace makeup it
was makeup like makeup brushes and look
at that the tide sheet for three oh nine
ninety nine thirty bucks off and there's
a $50 mail-in rebate eighty bucks so you
can get two you can get a 1950 X and
this motherboard if you're counting the
rebate for less than $1,100 about the
price of the CPU itself they're about
that's pretty good
that's pretty damn awesome it's the most
wonderful time of the year to buy CPUs
and modules and other parts
meanwhile frakkin Intel and coffee like
coffee like supply is still jack
whatever yields are getting on 40
nanometer plus plus must be awful
because they're still not meeting demand
and the pricing for whatever 8700 Kay's
you can actually find right now online
are completely inflated and well above
MSRP so it seems to me that unless until
it gets their together really soon
that AMD is gonna take the freakin crown
when it comes to the holiday holiday
profits the holiday profits like the
like they're gonna profit like hashtag
profit this oh I think I pulled
them
I meant the ones about Jesus oh no we
can say Merry Christmas again Cal oh yes
and Happy Hanukkah um alright alright
guys that's all right Oh is your coffee
like looking more like a pond booyah
nice nice alright speaking of speaking
of intel let's look at that while paul
shows you how stupid the prices are for
Intel CPUs right now gen here's a new
article from extreme tech talking about
Intel potentially trying
to boost their inventory there's my
Hazen stock for well above MSRP it's
four hundred fourteen dollars but it is
in stock okay so what are you saying
extreme tech was reporting some news
that Intel is potentially going through
with some plans to test their coffee
like CPUs at a new facility in Chengdu
China which alludes to the notion that
the company's yields are pretty low for
40 nanometer plus plus and specifically
for these top two your chips
it might also indicate that Intel is
having trouble hitting its targets its
targets for power consumption and
frequency they're pretty much aiming to
increase the supply of the core i5
eighty four hundred eighty six hundred K
and the core i7 eighty seven hundred and
eighty seven hundred K by basically
allocating some of their assembly and
testing process to this facility in
Chengdu so they're just trying to get
the ball rolling here and trying to
increase supply which the Chengdu
facility according to the article is
fully certified to test and assemble a
gen processors from Intel correct core
processors but so it's not gonna really
negatively impact consumers it's just
going to potentially result in you know
higher supply of beef gen core CPUs and
hopefully those will be listed at prices
closer to MSRP if all goes smoothly the
issue that I see with all this is that I
don't think that Intel's gonna be ready
to ship more copy coffee like CPUs in
time for the holidays so any sort of
potential deals that you might have got
or we're hoping for for coffee Lake I
don't think that they're gonna be ready
in time not for the holidays no no
definitely not if we're just if we're
just catching wind of this little change
right now then it's this isn't gonna
happen until ki1 2018 at the earliest so
just insane just insane how the tables
have turned so dramatically in just one
year for Intel and AMD
when it comes to the CPU stuff I'm
really surprised about the well I guess
I'm kind of surprised about the coffee
leak shortages I mean I was I know I
know they Intel had to push it out
faster than they were expecting to they
didn't have to but yeah it does it does
seem like they were caught off guard and
like I felt like they would have a
little bit more ready as a response by
now but I think we'll probably see more
I think Intel's
got more of an answer coming but
probably not until 2018 yeah
once they can fully flush out the coffee
leak line and get some more motherboard
options out there and that kind of thing
because I mean the 8700 K it is a very
good chip oh yeah it's it's an awesome
chip but it's a much better chip for
$380 or $370 than it is for four hundred
and ten dollars yeah and there's a much
better chip if you can actually find you
know a decent motherboard to go with it
- right or find the chip itself in stock
yeah our views speed our CPUs moving on
to this article from gamers Nexus they
released a fantastic article and video
to go along with it of a CPU roundup
best CPUs for 2017 you guys should all
check it out it's awesome it's great
video good article very very key for
this holiday week if you're interested
in buying CPUs on Black Friday or
something like that you should
definitely check this out they've
drafted up a couple different rewards
different categories for let's see three
four five six seven different rewards
including Best Overall value most
well-rounded and so forth and you can
obviously just listen to Steve and enjoy
his calming voice and respect and admire
his elegant flowing tech Jesus hair I'm
just gonna quickly go over the actual
CPUs that were granted each of these
awards because and I'm not gonna go into
too much detail beyond that because I
don't want to sort of you know take away
from the actual video that they play so
if you want more information on what
we're saying right now go
check out that stuff on gamers Nexus the
video and article we've got best overall
value the risin five 1600 X it's the
best overall value chip this is 1600
this oh wait okay we've got CPU link on
Amazon and initial review and then award
received so so it's a scandal so its
gamers Nexus is lying to its viewers
know that Paul that's not the message
we're trying to deliver here that's not
at all what we believe I'm just saying
there's there's two there's two columns
here see what's this video says best
overall value I would have to imagine
it's the r5 1600 I'm guessing since I'm
guessing since in the video let's double
check let's double check I mean I Steve
don't want to say there Steve we've
confirmed that this is a gamers Nexus
video best overall value what is it
let's see what can what is Steve let's
see what comes back tell us Steve okay
so his initial review I guess the 1600
maybe he just did an official review on
the 1600 X did not do one on the actual
1600 so he's just linking the most
closely associated CPU to he's
recommending and CPU he's never even
worked with that is not it's not again
it's not what we're saying that's the
hell of an accusation Cal know for you
to love your notes Steve not throwing
out allegation easiest tech Jesus and
basically I hate you basically so much
I've insulted him
I'm sure he's crying himself to sleep
right now so I think the I think that's
a very good choice I think it's a solid
choice for many reasons the r5 1600 is
definitely a great bang for the buck
chip and deserves the best overall value
org next up we've got the most
well-rounded CPU and that went to the
core i7 8700 K the chip that we were
just saying how expensive and hard to
find it is of course that has nothing to
do with how well-rounded it is as we all
know from several reviews and
Oh more of a square it's like your
square shape sure we'll call it call it
a square CPU the 87 okay now with six
cores and twelve threads is fantastic
not just for gaming but for workstation
applications as well we've seen some
pretty nice numbers and results from it
hammering out multi-threaded tasks and
it's also currently the fastest gaming
chip on the market so absolutely I would
say it's the most well rounded chip also
if that price range if Steve I know
right 72 conversely exactly blaze it it
would also I would think received the
award for most difficult CPU to find or
most inaccessible CPU most disappointing
launch perhaps that we've also got best
SMB and hobbyist production that would
go to the r7 1700 we have the best
budget gaming CPU I agree with this one
100% as well the G 4045 60 it's like
what 80 bucks it's gonna $80 CPU and it
still just just keeps on chugging still
pumping out the frames best budget
gaming no I'm sorry most fun to
overclock is the core I 970 960 X 768 is
the 10 quart 16 16 quarter geez I'm
thinking of the seven seven seven nine
hundred seventy nine eighty extreme
edition I mean I need to figure out that
like Intel likes to make CPU SKUs where
like there's a big number with the
letter probably but there's only one
actual number that matters so when it
comes to the excuse me the skylake X
CPUs the number that matters is the
third number the sixth third here aha
six is 16 8 is 18 4 is 14 and 2 is 12
aha 7900 how do I never said that before
yeah so that's I don't they ever say
these things at the press events that we
go to by the way guys he's a really
super easy way to
tell how many cores are in each of these
skis have the ability to look at two
things and associate them with one
another I'll never be able to do that
and then we've got the biggest upset to
the incumbent biggest upsets noticing
not biggest CPU that was the most
upsetting because a lot of people were
confused by that I was reading in the
comments and stuff on on their video
they mean biggest upset like the biggest
this right he was a super pissed off
about this he was like no it's not upset
no not so mad as a duel me hair and
we're talking about one specific meaning
of the word I was another second battle
the cage he's even got the updated price
with a $800 hey maybe that's great cuz
that just happened yeah I mean that's
only it wasn't 900 hundred for a bit but
right okay yeah but yeah they're pumping
out these videos like real time
practically 1950 ex definitely a big
upset to the Intel high-end desktop I'm
upset holy crap we're all upset with
Joey somehow and then finally biggest
disappointment which was the 77 40 X
wait that's a CPU I I didn't even I I
have no memory of this but now neither
do I did that even happen
clearly clearly a big disappointment if
we can't even remember it so guys go
ahead and check out gamers Nexus they've
got a lot of good stuff there on their
channel just threw it on the table like
I care not about the CPU throw it throw
throw I got for you okay alright thank
you Steve and crew at gamers Nexus job
well done for all of your thorough work
over there next up we've got this is the
final article from tech power up about
some significant management changes
going on at ek water blocks what is
happening over there
it's crazy what the sludge cakes where
are you going the hell are you doing oh
you need more beer wait wait let me kill
the bottle we did yes Wow it always
looks just so much bigger before we port
several big players miss
seriously up and left from ek
waterboxxes management this includes
their head of marketing on dredge which
is he's a super cool guy Paul and I have
both worked with him extensively he's
been the key player in providing us with
a lot of the parts and sponsorship and
support for arctic panther and hot line
and he just he's gone I remember I got
his email is like hey I did I'm leaving
I'm like no no you're so cool no don't
do it Andre so he's gone and then also
the CTO and then the CEO the CEO of four
years
Tinku mark tanco gone just all at the
same time we're out bitches what
happened were here mark was who first
worked with J marques kind of
coordinated that cos ek hadn't worked
with like a youtuber before and system
of J's earlier water-cooling videos that
he did with J
I heard Jay offered him like some sexual
favors or something I got a video okay
Kyle has evidence someone out soon
assume he must say something like that
and I was there something I've never did
before it's getting dark speaking all
right so what's going on here
mark tanco the now ex CEO of the company
said in a statement that it was fullest
and statements statements he said we can
confirm that there has been leadership
change at ek water blocks as a result
core management team consisting of CEO
CTO and head of marketing have left the
company we respect the decision of the
owner to go in a different direction our
views on how to how to further develop
and grow the niche and company were not
compatible anymore
I think that's the root of the issue
here their ideals are their ideas on how
to develop and grow the company did not
jive well with each other
that point so the founder / owner and
Edvard Koenig is now the CEO he's
declared himself CEO because he was the
original founder and owner of the
company his statement says that you know
it's more like public and stuff the
biggest changes need to happen in two
main areas of the company R&amp;amp;D and
communication all right this is moving
forward after these other guys left he
says the development team is already
strong at ek water blocks and they're in
the middle of it of its expansion both
internally and with external partners
which will considerably accelerate the
pace of development of new products and
it just seems like they're starting to
now get back into the rhythm again with
new additions to the company happening
they had like a pretty popular modern
joying recently I don't remember his
name and it looks like they're you know
what I'm confused by is who was
responsible for what because this was a
pretty good year for ek actually really
good year for ek they had their their
Predator series of AOS which were pretty
well received although they didn't
counter they went end-of-life lot sooner
than we thought they would and then they
had the fluid gaming series which I
thought was also a pretty decent product
they really tried to branch out into the
more if you want to call it mainstream
PC DIY market instead of just being all
about custom water-cooling and what I'm
curious about is are the guys who up and
left were they the ones trying to make
the company more mainstream are they the
ones behind like the fluid gaming and
predator line or they the ones like
against it do you know I mean like I'm
not exactly sure which side everyone's
on so I don't know after after them
leaving if EK waterblock is going to
continue pushing forward with these more
mainstream products that have been more
or less well received or if they're
going to like sort of regress back to
how they were and just remain a very
niche you know company so you're saying
you don't know if you should frame this
as like the heart and soul the company
has left and everything that they've
done that's good for consumers is gone
now
or ek has ridden itself of like a
caustic and abrasive part of the company
that was doing nothing and wasn't wasn't
helping out at all and now they can
focus on bringing the best products
possible to customers wait yeah we don't
know time will tell
time will time will inevitably tell as
it always does so we don't really know
what the future holds for our beloved ek
water blocks but I have a feeling for
now their water blocks will continue to
function yes
what if they all just didn't though what
if our signal cans are just started
leaking immediately Rob are you okay are
we good good okay good
I think so good I was worried that they
had some self-destruct button inside
built-in or something like that
battle royale but okay I think
we're good then cool cool well those are
that's you know best of what to ek water
blocks best of luck to the ragtag group
who left I know a man who left who we
have worked with who we have much
respect for end up going to a different
company where they able to take their
talents and make another product that is
offered to people yeah I'm sure maybe
this will be good on all sides yes
that's the way I like to look at things
yeah but I am I'm all for the best I'm a
hopeless romantic your big big success
super snappy all right that's pretty
much oh we got from tech news let's do
some donations thank you for everyone
who has given that money to us along
with some commentary starting with dead
stream goron
tenkan a deer's why do case fans spin up
full blast but only it started hmm I
think that's probably just because
they're just getting power and they're
not getting any data and once the once
that once it posts and stuff then it
receives the data as to its once the
temperatures are being because right
default settings are overkill default is
100% on default has no nuance default is
this needs to work because it's just
powering on
if the fans aren't running the CPU is
going to overheat so we're not concerned
about running the normal speed or
anything like that we need to just get
the system on depending on the
motherboard you're using and that kind
of thing once you've done that and
startup and then you know initial setup
or whatever someone you know a lot of
motherboards will actually have settings
where it won't do that I'm certain it
all depends some yeah that's like we've
got David domed $5.00 hey thanks for all
the great videos they helped me decide
on parts and build my second computer
arise in five sixteen hundred system in
the mesh if I see great CPU great case
congratulations on your second build and
very glad that the videos are helping
you out thanks David
thank you David and zo5 Givi asrock be
350 pro for micro ATX motherboard hasn't
got the best vrm cooling in the fretful
designed to find mini see how can I best
cool it for overclocking I have four
fans and a stock r7 1700 my
recommendation to you would be to
consider an air cooler that's one of the
downward firing air cooler so I could
some motherboards here the it's it's
it's it's like that and and the fans
like that and it pushes their down onto
the motherboard the there's various
options for that that are wider that
will push more air actually directly
over those VRMs the pro 4 is actually
one of the better be 350 motherboards if
you don't believe me
gamers exes is recent most recently
video was builds like he went over a lot
of the be 350 motherboards and that was
one of the ones he gave the thumbs up on
but yeah
it's a solid board especially for the
price it's only about 75 bucks or so and
either that or a secondary option I
would say would be to take your top fans
and flip him so instead of exhausting up
make them into intakes and those will
push air directly over just make sure
you get a dust filter if you do that
yeah you don't want a bunch of dust in
your case but thank you very much
NZ next week we got pup Shepherd up $5
high pile high pile
occasionally I'll try to combine our
names um hi Paul Kyle I am up to 461
subs now but I'll catch up with you guys
but of course in different topics wish

two as well papa and congrats on the new
subs keep it growing Benny I'm excited
for turkey day um yeah me too oh boy
daddy Dilek six dollars and sixty six
cents as usual paul sweet truck
oh great choice on the v6 manual but
holded didn't see changing them gears
not once Kyle if you had a Chuck your
beard would connect that's true
no no truck in the world would make my
beer to connect trust me I could have a
monster truck that eats cars like Paul's
for breakfast and my eggs still have a
half ass Asian beard that kind of looks
like it's just Moss randomly growing on
my face the only reason I keep it here
is because without it I look twelve
again go watch it's better to have it go
watch a new egg yolk episode one oh yeah
the early episodes go watch episode one
of my eggs yoked super classic for and
you know what because like I like I
still exactly like that people just
don't know it because I have facial hair
because he exactly thank you though
Scott I did I did change ears but yeah I
was driving on a highway for long
distances so I was mostly just in sixth
gear although I would fifth gear was
very handy for any time there was a
great or anything I had to go uphill
still had a decent amount of torque
torque J masta ten bucks
is this a sufficient bribe to get my pip
my PC submission featured finally I
don't know did you fortunately so J
masters let me let me say I'm gonna say
no I'm gonna say no since you asked a
question
the main problem I'm gonna tell you what
your problem is right now you have
submitted a question during the show
which we're gonna answer right now which
is a totally good thing and we thank you
for that donation and everything the
chances the cab will remember your name
come one week or two weeks from now very
very minimal slim to none yeah I'll put
that together right so what you need to
do somehow give them your $10 like
earlier in the day on Tuesday like I
don't know how you can make that known
to him you tell me your paypal dot me
link or something like give me my paper
that's gonna be your best bet I'll let
you give me money I mean so yeah you put
your Twitter on there so yeah it'll just
hit him up earlier in the day on Tuesday
that's when you got to get in his brain
yeah yes right now holy day off right
now we're like yes thank you totally
next time but it's it's not gonna happen
we both have goldfish memory how much is
going on all this great for it like that
especially on the show while drinking oh
my gosh it's amazing how much I forget
about what actually happens on the show
I love reading everyone's reactions in
chat about they're looking at yolked
episode one right now hurry oh my god
Kyle looks so weird that's holy hell
he's a boy yes guys check him out
I'm Jack Nelson yeah I am Dallas or at
five Australian I think I'm looking at
an r5 1600 with a gtx 1070 for my next
build but I can get another seven 1,700
with a GTX 1084 an extra 200 bucks with
the upgrade be worth the extra cash wait
say what 16 it says Emily versus a 1,700
a 1080 for 200 bucks extra I think
that's a great I think that's worth it I
think that's worth it it's basically the
same price increase that you would pay
so yeah question is do you mean ten
seventy is 400 a 1080s 500 that's 100
dollars in 1600 you can get for less
than 200 1,700 less than 300 now so
they're also still probably about a
hundred bucks apart so right yeah it's
about equal it's about where you'd want
it to so the upgrade is worth the exact
market value of those products right now
it's not a deal yeah it's not a great
deal it's not a bad deal right it's just
a matter of if you need the extra
computing powers a one-to-one scale it's
one-to-one scaling Jordan
five bucks love the show guys quick
question to what extent will a sixty six
hundred K at 4.30 Hertz bottleneck a
Vega 64
isn't that awesome didn't ya know you're
totally good you'd have to put it in a
bottle necking City situation like
intentionally playing like at 1080
resolution I really high frame rate or
something like that yeah now you're
totally good Heather Hansen
hello wifey sauce highway five bucks
honey go by Paul some air freshener
since you've ripped in his face earlier
didn't your mother teach you manners
love life II sauce well you know what
honey
Paul and I share just as many bodily
functions as you and I do of course we
took a wife that's about true let me
clarify the thought not true at all work
out good kissed once a good cut back
once charity and okay and was alright
nothing beyond that yeah yeah I was just
come as a moment in time right it was
justified never forget I agree was a
fling obviously but yeah are we talking
about I'll see you at home I love you
alright Nova 77386 five dollars so I'm
in a pickle oh I love I need a storage
pickle sounds good
I need a storage upgrade and debating
between separate SSD / HDD or a hybrid I
sense
tasty deals in the future suggestions I
would separate them I think I would buy
an SSD look look for two hundred fifty
two and six turn in 50 ish gig SSD for
like 70 bucks or less or maybe a 500 gig
ish SSD for 130 120 bucks in the next
week or so you'll probably be able to
find that deal and that's a it's kind of
what you want to look for it's
tantalizing yeah I'll have it reviews
five bucks sup guys just here to show
side a some love and support salute from
El Jefe
you the man man you are DF thank you
very much sir yeah yeah
we've got Sebastian Casella with the 100
Argentine years I've been trying to
overclock this MSI rx 470 and I only got
a stable core clock at thirteen hundred
and seventy five from twelve hundred and
forty five and seventeen hundred and
fifty megahertz for the memory is it
true the board partners sells this with
a light pre overclocked clocks it
depends on the admin you have an MSI rx
470 which I assume is an aftermarket
cooler on there sometimes they have
versions with aftermarket
or aftermarket coolers that still ship
at the same base clocks as the reference
version so it really just depends on the
specific model that you have that seems
pretty normal to me going from 1245 to
1375 yeah on an RX 470 seems like you're
about where you should be yeah there's
there's nothing wrong with that that
overclock it doesn't seem like there's
another ton more sealing room on an RX
470 that we what you've probably already
put in that's best I think I think
you're operating just fine you're
getting what you should be again what
you're capable of getting out of that
all seems pretty normal
ghost of Harambee that's terrifying five
great British pounds can you guys do a
cooling review of the new EK water black
