awesomesauce news today i'll be doing an
unboxing and quick overview on this
motherboard from gigabyte this is their
g1 sniper series m3 and it is a micro
ATX gaming motherboard and with that in
mind I did want to point out that
smaller form factor systems have been
getting increasingly popular these days
especially small form factor gaming
systems and I feel like because of that
a lot of manufacturers have started to
implement more and more full-featured
features on smaller form factor boards
so I think the m3 would be a prime
example of that so with that said let's
take a closer look at the box alright so
as you can see here this board does
feature intel z77 chipset it is socket
1155 so it does support all intel core
processors it also has the 3d bios and
that's basically gigabytes dual UEFI so
this board has two biases on it by Oh
Sees bios's and so that's cool if you're
overclocking you could have one profile
just at stock settings and the other one
at overclock settings or if you happen
to be updating your BIOS and something
goes wrong you always have that backup
BIOS to boot from we also have 3d power
which is essentially gigabytes power
delivery software and this board does
come equipped with virtue MVP it's
powered by some core 3d and it does
support sli and crossfire X for all of
your multi-gpu needs taking a look at
the back of the box we can see a
full-blown image of the motherboard
itself with a bunch of texts floating
around it highlighting some of the main
features that this board comes with but
I'm going to get into most of this when
I talk about the board itself and take
it out of the box but here you can just
see some a few highlights SATA rev three
USB three PCI gen3 a lot of threes going
on so inside you will receive a user's
manual a multilingual installation guide
book a fairly large poster here I'm not
going to open it up because I already
know it features the flank skull guy
with the knife in his mouth and quite
frankly he scares me get some sticker
here's some bullet decals some bullet
holes g1 killer oh this is going I can't
escape a school guy but those are free
to stick anywhere you please as long as
it's legal and you also get an SLI
bridge is a ribbon style SLI bridge it's
painted black when the flexi ribbon
style ones and it looks like you can
probably do some
by action with that you also get an i/o
shield painted black and some set of
cables of course two four six six SATA
cables and it looks like they've given
you a combination of the l-bracket
shaped and the straightaway SATA cables
in there three of each and last time
we've got the motherboard itself but it
can't really be seen in all of its glory
inside of this reflective packaging so
I'm going to take it out and give you
guys a closer look okay so clearly
gigabyte has gone with a black and green
color scheme for this board and i
personally think it looks fantastic you
can see here on the back even the PCB
isn't a nice black matte finish and that
goes for the front as well of course and
appear at the top we've got a four pin
eps CPU power connector 12 volt and just
take a look at that vrm heatsink right
there for a second it's very stylish and
right there got your 1155 sockets
compatible with both sandy bridge and
Ivy Bridge processors from Intel and
over here you have four dimm slots
supporting up to 32 gigs of ddr3 memory
at 1600 megahertz and here you have a 24
pin power connector for your motherboard
and a USB 3.0 port header which is
actually being natively controlled by
the z77 chipset it's got a black
heatsink over it with some gigabyte with
a gigabyte logo right there and green as
well I've got four SATA ports here these
two white ones up top are actually set a
rev 36 k bit per second speeds and these
two are set of f 23 gigabit per second
speeds all of which being controlled by
the z77 front panel connector is down at
the bottom very colorful and they're all
labeled for you for your convenience
those little buggers can be difficult to
get in there sometimes and this red port
right here is actually a USB 2.0 port
header you should be plugging into this
thing if you want to take advantage of
gigabytes super speed technology which
essentially allows you to charge your
USB enabled device whether it be a
smartphone or tablet at three times the
speed three times the charging sphere
that is as you normally would get from a
normal USB 2.0 port and speaking of
which there are two more right here you
can take a look at the corner of the
board you can see that there's a little
metal bracket going around its kind of
isolating or segregated the rest of this
board from itself and that's essentially
the on-board audio going on so it's
almost like a little discreet sound area
right here you've got your HD audio
connector right there but essentially
what this bracket is going to be doing
is reducing the amount of
feirense that might be caused by some of
the other component tree on this board
that could interfere with the sound
process so it's going to essentially
offer you more crystal clear audio for
your onboard sound aside from that
you've got your pcie gen3 point o
connectors right here this is a 16x slot
so if you have one card slot it in right
there this is a PCI Express 1x card or
1x lot and these two are also pci
express 3.0 x16 except this one is wired
for 4x and this one is wired for 8x it's
kind of backwards a lot of motherboards
do it the opposite way but if you are
going to be running a 2 card
configuration on this board make sure
you're sliding them into these two slots
right here aside from that if you want
to point out the fan connectors on this
board I think there are 1 2 3 4 of them
and they are all four pin fan connectors
on the back here we have your rear io
once it focuses I will continue you've
got USB 2.0 ports here two of them ps2
port vga dual link DVI displayport hdmi
that pretty much covers all your bases
as far as video outs are concerned I've
got two more USB 2.0 SATA port intel
gigabit ethernet lan port yay that's
nice to USB 3.0 and 7.1 channel audio
with your optical toslink out alright
guys that's going to wrap it up for this
video once again this has been the g1
sniper series m3 micro-atx gaming
motherboard from gigabyte and if i am to
give my own personal opinion on this
board i personally love it i think it
has a lot of full-blown features on it i
really enjoyed the pcie gen3
connectivity as well as the SuperSpeed
USB 2.0 edder one critique maybe a
critique is that i wish there was a
little bit more fam connectivity there's
only four headers i'd like to see more
but then again it is a micro ATX board
you're probably not going to be putting
it in a massive case with a bunch of
case fans but with all that said I think
it's a very solid board and I'd
recommend it to anyone who's looking for
a small form-factor gaming rig in the
near future so that's going to do it for
now guys thank you all for watching
awesomesauce news and i'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
