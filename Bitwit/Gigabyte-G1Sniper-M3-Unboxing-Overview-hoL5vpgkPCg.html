awesomesauce news today I'll be doing an
unboxing and quick overview on this
motherboard from gigabyte this is their
g1 Sniper Series m3 and it is a micro
ATX gaming motherboard and with that in
mind I did want to point out that
smaller form factor systems have been
getting increasingly popular these days
especially small form factor gaming
systems and I feel like because of that
a lot of manufacturers have started to
implement more and more full-featured
features on smaller form factor boards
so I think the m3 would be a prime
example of that so with that said let's
take a closer look at the box
alright so as you can see here this
board does feature Intel's z77 chipset
it is socket 1155 so it does support all
Intel Core processors it also has the 3d
bios and that's basically a gigabytes
dual UEFI so this board has two bios's
on it BIOS ease bios's and so that's
cool if you're overclocking you could
have one profile just at stock settings
and the other one at overclock settings
or if you happen to be updating your
BIOS and something goes wrong you always
have that backup BIOS to boot from we
also have 3d power which is essentially
gigabytes power delivery software and
this board does come equipped with
virtue MVP it's powered by some core 3d
and it does support SLI and CrossFireX
for all of your multi-gpu needs taking a
look at the back of the box we can see a
full blown image of the motherboard
itself with a bunch of text floating
around it highlighting some of the main
features that this board comes with but
I'm gonna get into most of this when I
talk about the board itself and take it
out of the box but here you can just see
some a few highlights SATA rev3 USB 3
PCI gen3 a lot of threes going on so
inside you will receive a user's manual
a multilingual installation guidebook a
fairly large poster here I'm not gonna
open it up because I already know it
features the flaming skull guy with the
knife in his mouth and quite frankly he
scares me
got some stickers some bullet decals
some bullet holes g1 killer
oh this go guy you can't escape the
skull guy but those are free to stick
anywhere you please as long as it's
legal and you also get an SLI bridge
this is a ribbon style SLI bridge it's
painted black on the Flexi ribbon style
ones and it looks like you can probably
do some
some 2-way action with that you also get
an i/o shield painted black and some set
of cables of course
two four six six SATA cables and it
looks like they've given you a
combination of the L bracket shapes and
the straightaway SATA cables in there
three of each and last time we've got
the motherboard itself but it can't
really be seen in all of its glory
inside of this reflective packaging so
I'm gonna take it out and give you guys
a closer look okay so clearly gigabyte
has gone with a black and green color
scheme for this board and I personally
think it looks fantastic
you can see here on the back even the
PCB isn't a nice black matte finish and
that goes for the front as well of
course and up here at the top we've got
a four pin EPS CPU power connector 12
volt and just take a look at that vrm
heatsink right there for a second it's
very stylish and right there your 1155
sockets compatible with both Sandy
Bridge and Ivy Bridge processors from
Intel and over here you have four dimm
slots supporting up to 32 gigs of ddr3
memory at 1600 megahertz and here you
have a 24 pin power connector for your
motherboard and a USB 3.0 port header
which is actually being natively
controlled by the z77 chipset it's got a
black heatsink over it with some
gigabyte with the gigabyte logo right
there and green as well I've got four
SATA ports here these two white ones up
top are actually set a rev 3 16 bit per
second speeds and these two are Center
up to three gigabit per second speeds
all of which being controlled by the z77
front panel connectors down at the
bottom very colorful and they're all
labeled for you for your convenience
those little buggers can be difficult to
get in there sometimes and this red port
right here is actually a USB 2.0 port
header you should be plugging into this
thing if you want to take advantage of
gigabytes super speed technology which
essentially allows you to charge your
USB enabled device whether it be a
smartphone or tablet at three times the
speed three times the charging speed
that is as you normally would get from a
normal USB 2.0 port and speaking of
which there are two more right here you
can take a look at the corner of the
board you can see that there's a little
metal bracket going around it's kind of
isolating or segregating the rest of
this board from itself and that's
essentially the onboard audio going on
so it's almost like a little discreet
sound area right here you've got your HD
audio connector right there but
essentially what this bracket is going
to be doing is reducing the amount of
interference that might be caused by
some of the other component tree on this
board that could interfere with the
sound process so it's going to
essentially offer you more crystal-clear
audio for your onboard sound aside from
that you've got your PCIe gen3 point-o
connectors right here this is a 16 X
slot so if you have one card slot it in
right there this is a PCI Express 1x
card or 1x slot and these two are also
PCI Express 3.0 x16 except this one is
wired for 4x and this one is wired for
8x it's kind of backwards a lot of
motherboards do it the opposite way but
if you are going to be running a 2 card
configuration on this board make sure
your slotting them into these two slots
right here aside from that I just want
to point out the fan connectors on this
board I think there are one two three
four of them and they are all four pin
fan connectors on the back here we have
your rear i/o once it focuses I will
continue you've got USB 2.0 ports here
two of them ps2 port VGA dual link DVI
DisplayPort HDMI that pretty much covers
all your bases as far as video outs are
concerned I've got two more USB 2.0
ports there eSATA port Intel Gigabit
Ethernet LAN port yay that's nice two
USB 3.0 ports there and 7.1 channel
audio with your optical Toslink out all
right guys that's gonna wrap it up for
this video once again this has been the
g1 sniper series m3 micro ATX gaming
motherboard from gigabyte and if I am to
give my own personal opinion on this
board I personally love it
I think it has a lot of full blown
features on it I really enjoyed the PCIe
gen3 connectivity as well as the super
speed USB 2.0 header one critique maybe
a critique is that I wish there was a
little bit more fam connectivity there's
only four headers I'd like to see more
but then again it is a micro ATX board
you're probably not going to be putting
it in a massive case with a bunch of
case fans but with all that said I think
it's a very solid board and I'd
recommend it to anyone who's looking for
a small form-factor gaming rig in the
near future so that's gonna do it for
now guys thank you all for watching
awesomesauce news and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
