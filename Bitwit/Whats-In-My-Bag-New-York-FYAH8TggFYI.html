channel Kyle gear I am at LAX Airport
right now about to head out to New York
City for my mini honeymoon with Heather
my newly beloved wife it sounds weird
still not used to it but we're going on
the trip because our real honeymoon is
until November we're going to Thailand
but we kind of wanted to get away from
all the chaos now that everything's
settled down a bit so we're taking this
a fun little trip to New York for a few
days so I wanted to not leave you guys
hanging without a video for this week so
I decided to do a kind of a what's in my
bag sort of Tura same thing I did for
the Hawaii vlog back in October which is
when I proposed to to Heather so I'm
kind of kind of interesting how that
works out
but so I'm just going to dive right into
it and we're going to check out what's
inside of my backpack all of the tech
things of course that I bring with me to
the beautiful city of New York all right
so the first thing that I've got in here
and this is a my only carry-on bag by
the way I had to check the rest of the
stuff but that's mainly just clothes is
my laptop this is an Asus g550 JK I you
might recognize it these are the same
model of laptop that we used for
Highlander when we took that trip with
the Logan from tech syndicate as well as
Linus tech tips crew very nice laptop
it's only got an 850 M inside of it does
have a core i7 it's good for light
gaming as well as editing which is
really what I brought it for as well as
replying to emails and that sort of
thing this has been my tried and true
companion for all of my traveling
endeavors for the last few years now and
I'm really glad to have it back with me
for this trip it's got back with LED
keys I'm not going to talk too much more
about that but there's a little preview
of that guy
next up what good is a gaming / editing
laptop without a good Mouse to go with
it so here we've got the rocket
taeyeon which i has quickly become one
of my favorite mice of all time just for
gaming and multipurpose use especially
good with the laptop when I when I have
multiple windows open on this the
smallish you know 15.6 inch screen this
little thin here for scrolling left and
right
between each of those pages comes in
handy quite a bit like the little thumb
pedal and the little trigger guy up here
it's also good for gaming so it is it is
wired so a little bit cumbersome for
travel but still I really can't go
anywhere without it when I'm bringing my
my Asus laptop around next up I've got
my amazing little vlog camera which is
right in hey where'd it go oh wait
that's right I'm filming with it right
now
it's the Sony rx100 m3 it's a great
little vlog camera and I seriously have
used it every single time I've been
traveling since the day I bought it the
first time again when the first time I
used it was in Hawaii of last year so
since then I've been just really happy
with the performance I love the flip up
screen that allows you to see yourself
while you're filming great for YouTube
stuff and all-around pretty solid sensor
so that you can see the quality is
pretty top-notch it's on auto right now
so the macro is actually pretty decent
you can see the stitching on here pretty
nice so yeah I'm pretty excited to be
using this on this trip as well alright
so this guy right here is actually a
first-time flyer I've never taken this
with me anywhere before but in fact I
actually just unboxed it for the first
time ever seconds before we ran out the
door on our way to LAX the reason why is
because SteelSeries that by the way this
is the SteelSeries Siberia elite gaming
headset and still series sent this to me
about a week ago they were supposed to
send me the SteelSeries H wireless
headset which I was going to do a pretty
extensive review on but they kind of
messed up the order and sent these to me
instead but it's kind of nice that they
did because I really didn't have a good
pair of cans for this trip other than
some like really crappy beats by dre
earbuds that came with my phone like
three years ago and those have been
getting pretty weathered so I was
actually happy to take these along with
me and glad to have them onboard you can
still see that there's a sticky
this is called full film here ah yes
you new yellow and honey as you can see
I've moved on to having a hand model
handle my products for me beautiful I
was beautiful honey so a couple features
about this headset it does have a nice
little boompole microphone here it is
retractable so when you're using it
primarily for you know watching movies
or music playback like I am on this trip
you can tuck it away just like that it's
pretty discreet doesn't so you don't
look like a weirdo walking around with a
full-blown headset and mic at the
freaking airport it's got super big
cushiony ear pads some of you guys might
be into that some of you aren't I
actually don't mind them I think they
look pretty cool how massive they look
on my head and they're very squishy
almost like a memory foam but I don't
want to exactly call them that keep in
mind this isn't a proper review I'm just
giving you guys some basics and from
what I can tell off of a first glance I
haven't like researched these things at
all another cool thing is instead of
having like retractable side of your
cups it actually just has this kind of
bungy mechanism so regardless of head
size you can kind of just put it in
without having to adjust each ear cup
individually kind of just does it on the
fly for you like that I also think it
does have some LEDs on the side I'm
gonna get to that it also does have some
LEDs around the side here that light up
I think it's RGB met it to program that
in the software though of course that's
only gonna happen when the headset is on
powered on the coolest feature about
this especially for for our trip is that
and I didn't know this until we brought
it along and I just looked at it a
moment ago is that it's got a share port
focus on the sharePort there you go it's
gonna share port so if you happen to be
with a buddy or a wife who also wants to
be listening to the same thing you are
and she's got her head headset of her
own or headphones of her own she can
plug into this and you can both listen
to the same thing simultaneously really
great for sharing and they look pretty
good they look pretty good on it you
wear those well honey good job very
comfortable one one thing I will say
about them is to be they do not block
out sound pretty much at all you can
still pretty much hear all the chatter
and all the noises of the terminal with
them on which also leads me to believe
that the sound leakage is
is pretty bad as well these are probably
Forever Alone heads headphones or it's a
foreveralone headset is what I like to
call them because they work best when
you're when you're alone one last thing
that I wanted to say about this headset
before we move on sorry I'm taking a
while on this is that it's got this
detachable cable so first of all it's
it's flat style its ribbon style so it
rolls up pretty nice as you can see but
the end of the end of it is kind of
modular and right now I've got just a
simple 3.5 millimeter jack right there
pretty standard but you can remove that
honey I'm one handed oh no I got it you
can remove that and then they've
included attachments for what one that's
got this as well as the microphone jack
and they also have an included USB sound
card with the audio inputs for your
eighth inch Jack's as well so kind of a
neat feature there all right so since
I'm feeling pretty ambitious I'm gonna
try to edit this very video that you're
watching while I'm on the plane with my
laptop that you saw earlier but when I'm
not editing or if it doesn't work out
for browsing the web because it is
fairly large and the seats in the
economy are fairly small I'm gonna be
doing a lot of my media consumption on
this little tablet here this is the
Nexus 7 from Google and Asus beautiful
tablet running a vanilla Android it's
just super zippy it's been super fast
since the day I got it it hasn't had any
problems at all this is also the same
tablet that I use for my teleprompter
when I'm shooting videos in the you know
actually scripted out reviews for the
channels so this thing has I've gotten a
lot of mileage out of this thing and
it's also great for work as much as it
is for play and finally apart from the
numerous battery packs that I have in my
bag which are kind of boring quite
frankly I have brought along this
wireless bluetooth keyboard from
Logitech this is their k810
fantastic fantastic fantastic keyboard
for travel basically if you looking for
a wireless solution it doesn't get much
better than this there are probably some
other good alternatives that are just as
good but I literally have fallen in love
with this thing this actually used to be
Heather's keyboard I actually got this
for her quite some time ago and then I
stole it from her because I loved it so
much honey I promise I'm going to get
you another one okay okay we'll get
we'll get two of these I promise I've
been saying that for years but this
thing is awesome you can actually
connect multiple Bluetooth devices and
then easily switch between them with
these hotkeys your F keys right there
it's also got here's the e on switch
white backlit LED keys yes this is
awesome so this would be great for like
a home theater PC granted if you already
have like a wireless mouse to go with it
or a touch pad of some sort because it
does not have a touchpad but I usually I
brought this mainly for my tablet so
this syncs up to the Nexus 7 beautifully
again I also use this for my
teleprompter when I'm when I'm doing
reviews and stuff you guys don't know it
but when I'm actually looking at you
guys
into the camera and I'm reading off the
teleprompter I've got this thing on my
lap the entire time and I kind of pause
and play with the script with the
spacebar here so if you ever listen
really carefully in my video sometimes
you might hear the faint click of the
spacebar and that's a that's that's
that's this thing right here so
altogether solid piece of hardware I
definitely recommend it if you're
looking for a portable solution when
traveling alright guys those are all the
things that are in my bag for this trip
to New York City if you guys enjoyed the
video be sure to toss a like on it
channel if you haven't already so I get
this video pretty brief just due to the
nature of where I'm at and also this is
the first time I've been in New York in
I don't know ten eleven years and how
those actually never been in her life so
if you've been in New York yourself
we're gonna be staying like in Manhattan
area but we're also gonna be venturing
out to like Brooklyn and stuff like that
or if you're if you've been to New York
or you live there yourself
you sure to blow up the comments with
any suggestions that you guys might have
any like must must see spots or go to
places that you really like in that area
that we can check them out and you can
also tweet me those ideas as well but
stay tuned for more content and we're
really soon as soon as I'm back from
this meeting mini-moon I suppose you can
call it regular content will be popping
up very shortly and that guess watching
love y'all be safe I should be safe from
the one traveling and I'll see you guys
