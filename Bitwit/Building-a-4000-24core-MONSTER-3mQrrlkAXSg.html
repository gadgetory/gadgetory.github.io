here at CES 2019 kicking things off
right I'm really excited actually we're
doing things a little bit differently
this year first of all they're showing
off a brand new case sort of brand new
it's the dark bass 700 but like you've
never seen it before because as you can
see it's in white and they actually have
this case show it off here at their
suite but I haven't seen an actual
completed system in it so you can only
just sort of get an idea you can you
kind of have to imagine the rest so I
thought it'd be kind of cool to bring
our own suite of hardware and actually
do a build inside of this brand-new
magnificent case for you guys to see
what a finished product could
potentially look like so we've got some
pretty good hardware in store I say we
just get started and I'll just sort of
talk about what I'm doing and where
we're going with this build as we go
about it so you know what let's prep the
motherboard first you can see we've got
an X 399 asus rog zenith extreme which
means we're going thread ripper baby I
will be doing an Intel build later this
week as well so I figured I'd switch it
up and show AMD some love yeah we're
doing a crazy build today this is the 29
70 WX 24 Core 48 thread CPU no big deal
I haven't even unboxed this yet this
alone is worth its own unboxing video
Andy sent this to me I was just for you
guys you get that one for free
AMD sent this to me and I've been dying
to get it open and just test it out and
just do something with it I just haven't
had the time until now which is crazy
because usually CES is the the one week
of the year where I have the least
amount of time to do anything this is
all just working out beautifully so I
just been boxing there was a whole team
that was just devoted to what's the
unboxing experience gonna be for the the
2970 WX and this is it people let's get
this guy out I just don't want to drop
it pull align us here ok let's first
open up the socket and they've even
labeled it for dummies like me so you
can go okay so if you want to open it
you go three two one three is right here
well it looks like it's already loose
someone's been in this board it's
probably me that guy off I mean the
tr4 socket is definitely the funnest
socket to work with it's the fun of CPU
you'll ever install as long as you don't
damage anything it's great look at that
look at that beautiful all right and
close one two three and the reverse
order we Came move on to the next step
which is installing our memory I've
really gone out of my way to impress you
guys today because we have not 16
not 32
64 gigs of g.skill tried NZ RGB ddr4
3200 speedram alright make sure they're
facing the right way don't want to
damage these extremely expensive sticks
in they go alright next up I say CPU
cooler which hey we're at Slyke the
perfect place to just free load off of a
CPU cooler this is the dark rock Pro 4
TR 4 version they made a specific model
just for thread Ripper this is already a
fantastic cooler from be quiet now it's
got 250 watt + TDP which is the same TDP
as the 29 70 WX now there's a bunch of
schools of thought for for applying
thermal paste to a thread Ripper I'm
gonna ignore all of them and just go
straight down the middle here now excuse
so we've got a crossbar here the longer
one goes on bottom the shorter one on
top and you just screw them down screw
them down to Chinatown as Lyle would say
make sure to remove the plastic peel on
the bottom of the cold plate haha I only
removed half of it make sure that you
remove all of it that could have been
really bad if I didn't notice that only
half of it went off oh and there's still
a little bit here
letting go is hard for some parts now
this is a duel tower heatsink you've got
two fans as well but the second fan that
goes in the middle between the heat
sinks isn't gonna come around until
we've mounted it first cuz you need is
this sort of an order of operations here
so I've got the crossbar another
crossbar here that goes or right over
the Coldplay I love the screwdriver
that'd be quite includes the handles a
little small but it's got a magnetic tip
and it's long enough to thread these
screws down these are really nice fans -
there's also rubber rubber pads on the
heat sinks themselves for reduced noise
and vibration alright fans in and then
just got a screw in these little beauty
caps it looks like they've also included
four pin PWM fan splitter for our 4 pin
PWM fans and I love how everything's
sleeved in black CPU cooler installed
this build is already looking good and
we haven't even noted in the case yet
the last thing we want to do here is
install the m2 Drive before we actually
mount the motherboard inside the chassis
so I've got a 960 Pro here 512 gigs so
we've pulled out from our motherboard
box dim dot 2 card it's basically a
little PCB it's got 2 m dot two slots on
it one on either side and it slots into
what looks to be a dim slot it's just
been rewired - - except 10.2 nvme PCI
Express drives so I actually
don't have a little screwdriver for
mounting em two drives so I'm gonna do
this by hand like a boss which is really
not that difficult to do that's perfect
that looks great all right we're gonna
mount this sucker in here just like we
would a stick of memory boom our
motherboard is fully prepped so we're
gonna go ahead and mount it into the the
dark base 700 light a dish beautiful
tempered glass side panel I'm gonna put
this aside so we've got pre-installed
standoffs and we of course have
pre-installed IO shield on the zenith
extreme so we're gonna mount it in like
so just make sure to line it up now even
though we're mounting an air cooler in
here this can't support up to three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiators
so if you're doing liquid cooling you're
good on that as well now if you guys are
wondering if there's any technical
changes about this white version there
isn't but they have changed apart from
the white exterior and interior the
actual tempered glass side panel is no
longer tinted which i think is a great
call because you can see your parts
better I've never been a huge fan of the
tinted look just just give me glass
unfiltered it's like what's the point
you know what's the point of making
something see-through and then tinting
it so that it's harder to see through
you still get that option for an
inverted motherboard layout which i
think is awesome I'm actually a huge fan
of the inverted look it also kind of
helps you know depending on what kind of
air flow goals you have sometimes
inverted can can actually work in your
favor so next up we've got the power
supply they didn't have all the options
in the booth a lot of the power supplies
right now especially the higher end ones
are in use so we're using a 650 watt
it's a straight power 11 great fantastic
unit I'd probably go with something a
little bit higher though for a 24 core
thread but for CPU and of course the GPU
that we'll be putting in shortly however
fully modular yeah 80 plus gold gold
gold I love one pro tip that the verge
did get right is to always screw with
confidence and that looks pretty
confident to me power supply installed
so we've got these one two three four
five little panels they actually serve
sort of a dual purpose you could remove
them completely and actually put in one
of the trays where these trays three and
a half inch mounts so mechanical drives
whatever you can put five of them here
you can also mount two more three and a
half inch drives underneath the power
supply basement so that's an option or
you can actually pop them out slightly
to make room for passing
cables through and that's actually what
we're gonna do because we've got our 24
pin here there we go also you guys
probably noticed that there are cable
routing grommets rubber grommets behind
the board but this is an e ATX board
which this case obviously supports if
you had a smaller board you'd obviously
be able to use those cable grommets as
well so this isn't the only cable
routing option we're just using it
because we have a bigger board eight pin
EPS coming through they just have a
full-blown slot for freely routing
cables through it's a very wide slot
that spans the entire width of the case
pretty much so it makes it really easy
to route cables oh I forgot that our
eightpence actually way over there to
the right because this is thread ripper
and we're dealing with such a high core
count we should actually be putting two
of these cables in here so we need
another eight pin DPS cable which I
don't know if our straight power 650
will have one of those because it's
really not designed to handle CPUs on
this scale again this is so I've brought
along with me a gigabyte Oris r-tx 2080
the fans the LEDs on these fans is it's
kind of unlike any other card on the
market it is worth pointing out that
this case also does have two vertical
slots right here so it could natively
support vertically mounted GPUs
however again because this card is so
massive it would technically fit you
know we got to do it we got to do I mean
wow I don't know I don't know though
it's a form versus function thing here
because if we mount it this way it puts
the fans awfully close to the side pin
and that's gonna choke the airflow so
you know what guys we're going
horizontal cooler is quite big we can't
actually access the top piece a slot so
we're gonna go with the second one I
can't believe I didn't point this out
yet but the case comes included with two
of the quiets very own silent wings
three 140 millimeter fans you get one at
the intake at the front and one at the
rear you guys can probably get a better
look of the the backside of the case
here a couple things to point out here
is our pwm fan controller very nicely
stapled to the back of the motherboard
tray plenty of room for long power
supplies and of course you could even
remove this this drive cage I believe
which has again support for two three
and a half inch or two and a half inch
drives you can remove that completely it
would also open up more room for thicker
radiators at the front of your case
should you be moaning
Rad's there we also have one two three
more slots for two and a half inch
drives lots of tie-down points for
cables and a very generous cut out for
your CPU cooler we have a four pin RGB
connector which is going to light up the
front of the
case you also get about an
inch-and-a-half it looks like of space
between the motherboard tray and the
side panel for extra cable managing
sound dampening material alright here it
is let's see if i can still build a
computer and make it turn on beautiful
app i love it
some i actually point it out one of the
be quiet rest pointed out that you get
some really nice lumination here that's
just that's just courtesy of the RGB
implementation on the motherboard it
actually looks really nice there is an
urgent button i believe as well
aha it switch between several different
colors so if you guys are interested in
getting your hands on one of these cases
it's gonna be available in February
right around the corner but limited
release so three thousand units will be
made in total we have unit twenty seven
hundred and fifty out of three thousand
and you can see here the badge is
actually that's got an adhesive backing
it's now separated from the case you can
actually put it anywhere you want to
think this would be a good option right
here wherever you want to put it or
gonna have to put it at all so it's
actually to be available for about ten
dollars more than the original dark base
700 I believe the original was 179 so
this is gonna be 189 a very small price
to pay for the lovely white option that
you see here so altogether still the
great same fantastic case that you're
used to but now in white</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
