it antlion the company who brought you
the original mod mic that allowed you to
pair any set of headphones with a high
quality modular microphone has just
released their brand new product the mod
mic Wireless which aims to deliver the
same high-quality voice chatting
experience but wait for it with no
strings attached the all-new q2 lighting
system from NZXT brings even more
possibilities to your setup with
addressable RGB underglow cable combs
and monitor lighting with the unique
ambient mode that pulls colors from your
primary display to create a
one-of-a-kind gaming experience check
out everything q2 has to offer in the
link below so first I'm gonna give you
guys a super quick rundown of this thing
and then we're just gonna hop into some
games for the rest of the video and I'm
gonna ask random gamers what they think
of my voice do I sound clear and my
fuzzy is it sounding good or bad that
way we get sort of a real-world and
unbiased opinion of how the mod mic
Wireless sounds and I'm sure all the
gamers we come in contact with today
will be super respectful and happy to
help so what's the dealio with this
thing well we've got full band audio
quality supposed to sound crystal-clear
in your ear as well as apdex low latency
and that's supposed to be five times
faster than standard bluetooth so even
though it's a wireless microphone you
should still have a pretty minimal delay
between the time you're speaking and the
time the person on the other end can
hear you it's also packin up to 12 hours
of battery life which should be long
enough for most gaming sessions included
with the mod mic Wireless you get a
fairly nice travel case the microphone
itself users manual all the mounting
accessories and a USB receiver which is
how the microphone connects to your
system in the first place now the
receiver does need to be within direct
line of sight of your microphone in
order for it to work optimally which is
also why antlions included a USB
extension cable so you can position that
receiver anywhere you want and they've
also included a micro USB charging cable
of generously I like the microphone
actually the build quality is not bad at
all it's got a single button one button
that will power the device on and off
it'll pair it to the receiver and it
also acts as your mute buttons there's
three LED indicators on the microphone
which is kind of pointless because you
won't be able to see them when it's
actually on your headphones but those
same LED indicators are on the receiver
itself so you can easily see if you're
paired or connected or if you're muted
battery's low and that sort of thing
here you'll also find a micro USB
charging port and yes you can
and use this microphone at the same time
although that kind of defeats the
purpose of a wireless microphone but you
do have the option if you run into a
desperate situation you get a flexible
bendy boom pole so you can position the
mic optimally and there's a two step
switch so you can actually choose
between your pole or pickup pattern
whether it be unidirectional or
omnidirectional the mic itself is noise
cancelling and does include a handy
little windscreen now you mount this
suck attea headphones the exact same way
you did with the original mod mic
magnetic clasps they seem to be doing a
fine job and so if it ain't broken don't
fix it there's basically a magnetic
clasp with an adhesive backing you stick
that to the side of your headphones it
can be stuck to either side really
although they do recommend putting it on
the right side that way the microUSB
port is faced down so that if you happen
to be charging while you're using the
cable just Falls a bit more naturally
you'll also notice there's a magnet
built into the mic itself so once your
magnetic clasp is it's heared to your
headphones you can simply just slap it
on and you're good to go I should also
mention that there are ridges in the
magnetic clasp so you can actually pop
your microphone up and down if you want
to move it get it out of the way and
stuff like that but without further adue
like I promised let's go ahead and set
this microphone up jump into some games
and just ask random people how do I
sound
can you guys hear me nope
all right you're all dead to me hello
can anyone hear me oh hey how's my voice
sound it sounds alright alright okay I'm
actually trying to test out this
microphone that I just got can you guys
let me know how the quality is it's okay
would you say it sounds better than the
average person's worse than the average
person's or about the same better oh
really
yo just like in what way it's just a
little bit clearer maybe more crispy
yeah anyone have a mic hey Danny great I
just got a new microphone and I have no
idea how it sounds I was wondering if
you guys can tell me if it sounds good
perfectly what kind of it's a mod mic
Wireless would you say my mic sounds
better than average or under all the
other people I play with it they just
everything cracks up sometimes I hear
the background noise it's just annoying
do you hear oh cool so there's no like
hiss or static or anything
nothing hey how does Maya how does my
voice quality sound right now and I just
got a new mic
does it like on a scale of one to ten
what would you rate it at like a ten
really yeah is it just like super clear
like no hissing or anything right yeah
nice your mic sounds pretty good to you
what are you using some cheap $10 one
good good deal
I don't know I someone gave it to me for
free that's a really good deal that's
true
it's very good deal Jim I think I think
I think you need a new mic maybe you're
a mute maybe that's your thing maybe
just reply in Morse code you know any
time the mic goes on and off it's it's
just your thing that's cool yeah I'm
sorry I don't I don't know Morse code so
still don't know it all right how about
this if my microphone sounds good tap to
talk twice it just it just looks like
one really long tap I was - that was -
he likes that you think my mics good all
right cool
thank you for your feedback quite
literally feedback of your mic is awful
hey so how's my mic sound I just got a
new one but I have no idea how it sounds
it sounds amazing
amazed but are you just saying that
sarcastically no it actually sounds
really good really like how your voice
is pretty like exact same in real life
wow that sounds pretty good actually
yeah it's like no buzzing if I streamed
with this mic do you think that it'd be
good enough quality to do live streaming
oh yeah definitely
eastream are gonna I don't stream yet
but I'm you know I'm planning to make it
big on the twitch scene how do you plan
on doing that well the first step was to
get a good mic and I feel like I've done
that yeah see I'm already
I'm already practically there you have
two monitors I do I do have two monitors
yeah that was my next thing and I
already got those so I'm pretty much
ninja at this point doesn't you have
three monitors yeah yeah you know but
you know I think he just I'm more
pragmatic than him oh no I think they're
coming after me man you aren't you are
man right or a boy you male
I'm actually late I was trying to do a
girl voice but actually you actually got
it right yeah well you know I was just
talking to a girl and I thought she was
a guy and then turned out she wasn't and
I felt I felt really bad because no
people don't even understand that like
they say I have a girl voice right right
yeah totally I get you well microphone
are using I'm just using regular mic
oh well that's why I mean you got to get
a mud mic Wireless and then people will
know you're a boy I feel you my voice is
so squeaky like I haven't hit you yet
I'm 14 it'll pass eventually man you
know just enjoy the squeaking this won't
last it'll go away once it goes away
you'll be a total stud with the ladies
yeah you guys will go away for summer
you know summer break and when you come
back from school and your squeaks are
gone all the ladies are gonna be like
man I I really wish I had hooked up with
that squeaker guy when I had the chance
okay all right Oh totally thank you
I've been through it man that's that's
exactly what happened to me I just got a
new mic and I have no idea how it
actually sounds quality wise does it
sound okay great is the quality so good
that you wouldn't mind if I sang a song
not at all okay well in that case really
really call my bluff there then I I call
this piece microphone which will be sung
to the tune of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody
he's this that good mic
is it just staticky put on your
headphones and witness my clarity open
your ears turn on your voice chat
and see I'm just a gamer on my gaming PC
because I'm testing out audio little
high so I guess I'm not gonna lie though
that was a very impressive song I'm very
happy with that
oh thank you it's just in the quest of
trying to assess this microphones
quality it's very important to me how
would you rate it one out of ten I would
say a solid eight okay I'll take an
eight what could have made it a ten in
your quiet I'm a little quiet I don't
know I don't know if that's you or just
my microphones turn down okay there's no
kissing when I talk or anything is there
you're good well so curious how I can't
hear your most clicks at all you can't
hear the mouse clicks or the keyboard at
all that's good it's supposed to be a
noise cancelling mic so I guess it's
doing its job we don't know they push
the talk on or anything you're just
using your mic and yeah no I don't have
push-to-talk on at all I mean if I like
really mash the keyboard you probably
hear that yeah well cool thanks for the
feedback hello anybody got the talkee
talkee machine I got the talkie-talkie
machine do you have the talkee talkee
machine hey how's my voice sound I have
no idea if my mics any good it sounds
good it sounds like a screamer mic I
actually haven't no I'm not a streamer I
I'm just I'm training to be to be ninja
but you know I need a good mic first
before that can happen I mean what's the
one thing that ninja has that no other
streamer does an awesome mic right skill
yeah I be sure yes skill skills one
thing but I mean would anyone ever watch
ninja if his mic sucked no thank you
what they watch him if he was bad maybe
if they loved the sound of his clear
voice yeah but he like gets me sometimes
though well you know I think he's still
going through puberty and stuff so does
my voice sound really clear is it good
yeah it's really clear would you say
it's one of the the clear microphones
you've heard playing for tonight yeah oh
no I think I think I'm toast oh I tried
I was so close I loosened that jar for
you but you know no worries dude you're
only ten
so you tried I'm a girl by the way oh
you're a girl oh wow I couldn't I'm
sorry sorry yeah well my dad's account
sorry okay it's also probably because
your mic sucks and if you had a better
mic I felt you're a boy but you know you
should tell your dad to get a better mic
this is really awful
I'm sorry it's just a normal headset
I've had it forever you should be you
should be very sorry we'll all be gosh
darn Diggity damn everyone seemed to
really like this microphone in fact in
the entire hour and a half that I was
playing the game I didn't have one
person tell me that the mic was bad
sounding or even just okay sounding
everyone said my voice either sounded
good or great I'm really impressed with
the feedback I'm actually surprised I
thought it would be more of a mixed bag
no one on the Internet these days has a
problem telling you what's on their mind
or how they really feel so I kind of
believe them when they say that the mic
sounded really good I honestly think it
sounds great I was playing it back to
myself earlier it's a hundred twenty
bucks so definitely a bit more than the
original mod mic or the mod mic 5.0 or
mod mic five and it's super flexible as
well Wireless completely cuts the cord
it's a good product what can I say
guys let me know what you think I'll put
a link for it in the description below
apart from that you can toss a look on
this video if you enjoyed it and get
