going guys yo hello everyone welcome to
booted this is episode 4 for all the
marbles this is the grand season finale
of season one the very first finale of
this series thank you all for being here
so much I know this is a very new
initiative for the channel so i just
want to give a huge shout out i'm very
grateful to all of you who have
supported this new initiative so far so
I'm good to have you all back and if
your first first timers well welcome i
hope i don't disappoint you like I
usually do but yeah it's gonna be an
exciting show because everything is on
the line we've got a 500 all or gift
card that we're gonna be giving away not
given away but one lucky finalists will
be earning tonight / your votes we all
in the live audience there so hey let me
know if the audio video is ok I know we
were having a rough start with the first
couple of episodes there with us and
choppiness freaking chopped salad over
there but hopefully I am using a new
system for today one that I have not
tried before and that is I think I have
an actual I set up a little cam for it
i'm using the silent night bill that i
did back in december for christmas
that's why it's all red and green and
god awful ugly but before i was using a
half stacker build with a 4770k and
there was no discrete GPU in there i was
just running off of the integrated
graphics on the cpu so hopefully this
does a better job of I don't know
smoother streaming inevitably hopefully
that's hopefully that's the deal but
y'all let me know y'all let me know no
lag looks good yeah yeah let's let's
just hope that that carries through the
rest of this episode I really hope it
does but on that note this is really
exciting guys im sue
I'm super excited to see who wins
because i was looking at all three
contestants earlier today thinking about
who i would vote for personally and I
it's a tough call man it's a tough call
you know I really like the age for 40
and all three finalists today have an H
for 40 that just happened coincidentally
this is not sponsored by NZXT in any way
it's actually sponsored by fantex who
I'm going to talk about right now
actually and then we're going to dive
right into the three finalists we're
going to recap on all the pros and cons
of each of their systems and then put it
to a vote and see which one brings home
the dough and which which other to get
booted indefinitely I know it's very sad
this is a very sad depressing show but
why don't we go ahead and take a look at
our sponsor fantex you guys have been a
great sponsor for this first season of
booted you guys put your faith in me a
lot of other sponsors probably wouldn't
have taken the leap of faith that you
guys had especially on a on a little
youtube channel like myself but they've
got some great stuff here their new
eclipse p400 is an excellent case I had
a chance to look at it at CES 2016 just
last month and they've even got a pea
400s for a silent silent version well
they got the p400 which is not silent
and they got the p400 s4 silent you know
like Sam dampening material on the
panels and stuff like that they've got
some RGB colors here well it's not
sixteen point whatever million colors
there are like nine or ten different
colors you can scroll between and they
do have some RGB strips to go along with
that which if you guys have an empty Lux
then you're probably familiar with that
whole set up and we're gonna be talking
a little bit more about their new RGB
LED LED adapter and how you can possibly
get one for free so stay tuned for that
yeah yeah yeahs is it still smooth I'm
expecting any minute now for the stream
to just crash and and for things to be
horrible but let me know let me know so
far it's looking good I'm seeing zero
drop frames according to xsplit they
could be lying to me but who knows um
but on that note let's let's just
ahead and quickly recap let's go to the
how it works page all right so you guys
who have stuck with me from the season 1
premiere earlier this month you were
there for week one when we had our first
five contestants you were there for week
two when we had five more and week three
where we had the last of our 15pc
entries and we voted 12 of them off and
only three of them came out in the end
and that's where we're at right now is
week four with three remaining finalists
very exciting stuff very exciting and
like i said it's it's anyone's ballgame
it's anyone's game right now because
really they're all pretty excellent
little systems here and this is the
mid-range edition by the way so you're
not going to see anything super fancy
high-end and you're not going to see any
any low-end ketchup and mustard stuff
either so we're right in that sweet spot
this is probably the type of bill that
most people have it's probably the most
relatable system tier if you will so
hopefully you guys are familiar with
that sort of thing and before I ramble
on too much longer why don't we go ahead
and kick it off with contestant number
one finalist number one I should say
which is Luke Luke Luke Luke you are
weak one finalist the very first
finalist of the series how's that feel
Luke do you feel you feel any different
are the ladies ladies flocking to you
like like an axe commercials I bet they
are if they're not then you just need to
tell him look I was a week one finalist
on booted season one baby getting my
getting my drawers whatever the kids say
these days you've got a pretty nice
system here Luke you've got an Intel I
don't need to talk about the case but
you've got a core i5 4690 k got an NZXT
Kraken x60 one beautiful cooler msi
crate edition z97 s also very nice
choice of motherboard for this case as
you can see here guys he's gone with the
white edition kind of a black and white
theme we take a look here you've got a
radeon r9 265 which is probably the most
questionable part hardware-wise of this
build because it is pretty low powered
compared to the beefy cpu you've gotten
there but maybe that's maybe that's
exactly what you had in mind for
spending that
dollar gift card on its maybe a new
fancy GPU but there are a lot of things
I like about this system for one I think
you've got the theme down pretty solid
the black and whites there's nothing
that really stands out I mean there's a
little bit of red on that sandisk SSD
I'm not gonna fall for that it's so
minimal and you don't really see it all
too much but cable sleeving as well I
really like how you got those White's
white extensions i as i mentioned in
week one i would have liked to see some
more tightening maybe some zip tying or
some cable training of that pcie cable
that looks like it's kind of just
fraying at the end as it goes into that
lower cut out there and the psu shroud
so maybe some point stock for that and
yeah i mean honestly this is this is a
pretty solid build if we look at the
money shot here you can kind of get a
look at yeah that's definitely a budget
card you get those nasty red stickers on
the bottom which are you know a lot of a
lot of cheap e video cards these days
don't tend to look the greatest and
that's that's not i'm not going to fault
you for that really because this isn't
about how much money you have to spend
on high-end GPUs it's about the pc as a
whole and i think overall you've done a
nice job i really like how you went with
an NZXT cooler and an NZXT case those
two go hand-in-hand really beautifully
as you can see the white fans there they
all match all the radiator fans and your
case fans very much in sync which i
think was a really good call you do have
some LEDs on this bad boy as well and
that was one thing that I think I doubt
you some points for and again guys if
you're not aware the points here don't
matter just like in whose line is anyway
I just like to just like to give them
out or take them away but yeah the LED
strip which you can see over here guys
he's lined right along that hard drive
cage wall whatever you want to call it
which is granted probably one of the
best spots you could pick one of the
only the few spots that you can choose
to have led strips to run along the H
for 40 if it's a on that side of the
case but the downside to that is that
you kind of see the LEDs bleeding
through the side panel window which um
you know it's it's not my fave it's not
my fav it doesn't look quite as seamless
it's a bit
distracting kind of takes away from your
actual components and I would have liked
to see another LED strip maybe on the
left side of your chassis so that you
would provide some more even lighting
across the entire innards of your case
just to give a more even coat of
lighting that sort of thing and here's a
nice wide shot of your system it looks
like you keep it very clean as well so I
appreciate a nice clean system it looks
like you dusted or you clean it out
regularly or it's a brand new system
that you just built but given the the
hardware specs hair going with Haswell
and an older generation AMD card i would
guess that you built this maybe a year
to go pro or a year ago so um but haha
you know what time it is now guys you
know what time it is it's time to reveal
luke's cable management this is the
first time on the series that we will be
revealing such a thing Revere rearing
revering words um let's take a look you
never know what we might find behind the
motherboard tray boom okay so uh the
other thing about cable management here
is that since all of our three finalists
are using the same case we can kind of
rate their cable management on an even
playing field right a same same number
of tie downs same same space and all
that sort of thing and here it looks
like you've done a decent job it's not
as atrocious as it could be and the
thing about the age for 40 and frankly
any case that has a power supply shroud
that allows you to just stuff cables
inside of is that it tends to make you a
bit lazy when it comes to cable
management it really does and a lot of
the bills that I've done that have power
supply routes I usually just say screw
it and I just stuff them all in the
power supply uh in that area under the
under the shroud now that's fine because
no one's really going to see it I mean
from you know from the from the regular
basic side of from this angle no one's
going to know they're none the wiser but
where cable management does come in
handy regardless of people of people can
see it or not is when you need to swap
out a component or you need to rewire
something then the the clutter really
takes away its
convenience and having a night a nicely
wired system is very important as a
builder if you're a DIY type of person
that is we're swapping out components
you're upgrading your troubleshooting
things replacing your hardware and stuff
so I think you've done a pretty fair job
I mean it looks like you are utilizing a
lot of the tie-down points where you
should be it's just when you get to that
power supply shroud area it looks kind
of jumbled and I think that could be a
little bit neater not for anyone who
walks in your room sake like I said
they're not going to see it but for your
sake Luke to tidy all that up at the
bottom and and make your life a whole
lot easier anytime you need to swap out
something but overall overall beautiful
beautiful system here Luke I can see why
the audience has voted you week one
finalist on that note why don't we go
ahead and move on to Mitchell Mitchell
wait is this Luke's build again no no
it's not actually they just look
strikingly strikingly similar in the age
for 40 white edition we've got another
core i5 this time we're going with a
6600 k so we're on that current gen
skylake hype on we've got an NZXT Kraken
x40 one and a Suzy 170 AR motherboard
great budget semi budget to mid-range
board but i will i'll talk about that
board in a little bit got 16 gigs of
Corsair Vengeance and an EVGA gtx 960
supe super cluck alright looking at this
system from this angle cable management
is pretty pretty on point I will say
again we've got those white sleeved
extensions which i'm really loving goes
perfectly with with the system i can't
really argue that at all and and I like
your I like your cooler choice it's not
a 240 but that doesn't matter i think
it's it's well placed and it looks good
in the system you've also got an NZXT q+
there and it looks it looks really nice
in that s SD slot who would have thought
that a that an NZXT Hugh plus would
match so well with one of their own
cases but we're going to
see some some LED money shots in just a
bit the PCIe cable however coming from
that 960 of yours it looks a little bit
awkward to me because it looks like you
tied it down kind of at the back like
reddit you know where your motherboard
is and then it kind of just hangs out it
kind of pulls like a sharp right and I
think that looks a little strange
especially when you have that cable cut
out that the h4 40s provided you right
at the at the power supply shroud there
so I don't know not a huge fan of that
of that routing strategy or that routing
decision but you know it's it's taste
its taste it's just my like opinion man
and then you've got some some money shot
for us here now this is where I have a
gripe with the motherboard the c 17 t AR
while it is a fantastic board and i've
read a couple good reviews about it for
its price point and stuff it's got a lot
of features it does have a brown PCB
which personally not a fan of it doesn't
really match with anything I mean maybe
not even the it's not even the same
shade of brown that you'd find on like
enough to a fan and it just it just
looks very budget I don't know what it
is but anytime I see a brown PCB on any
kind of motherboard or in any system it
just strikes me as being kind of like a
more economical piece of hardware and
yeah so black PCB might have been a bit
of NASA looking choice there however
when we go over to your your LED shot
here it looks absolutely fantastic
obviously you can't really see the the
brown because it's kind of flushed out
by the LED strips of that NZXT queue and
unlike Luke you've actually placed the
LED strip kind of far off to the right
and you you caught on to this I feel
like you probably initially have the LED
strip mounted in the same place that
Luke did and then when you lit it up and
put the side panel on you realize that
it was still kind of too close to the
side panel window and you were seeing
some LED bleeding kind of threw that
that window there so you took the extra
went the extra mile to route that cable
a little bit out of the
way that LED strip I mean and I think it
really paid off here because it it's it
looks very nice the coding is fairly
even it looks like you've got a longer
strip as well than Luke did so you do
get a nice little bit of a more more
even lighting all around which is nice
but um nice color choice to see what you
did there but um but not as all not all
is is done just yet we still have to
look at mitchells cable management and I
don't know what do you think guys what
do you think it is compared to Luke's
let's find out boom you know honestly if
you were to show this to me right beside
Luke's one after the other I would think
it was the same system because it almost
looks like you guys have taken the exact
same approach and put in about the same
amount of effort when it comes to cable
management again there's some use
there's some use of tie downs here I can
see a couple points but I feel like
there were some missed opportunities
where you could have grouped more cables
together and then going back to that
power supply shroud conundrum where it's
just so easy to stash and you know cram
everything into that little space that
large space actually but yeah not not
the greatest when you're trying to
upgrade components or or rewire certain
pieces of hardware so the audience will
take that for what they will I will
leave it in their hands but overall
solid little machine that you've got
here Mitchell again I think the audience
was a you know that they got it right by
moving you on to the final round but
we've got one more guy to go or a girl
I'm pretty sure he's a guy though it
sounds like a guy named ha no ha no i
hope i'm pronouncing your name right
again i'm sorry if i'm not we've got
another yet again as I said in h 4 40
this time it's in black and red so
refreshing it's just a different color
that makes all the difference in the
world but you've got you've also got our
first lock skew processor you've got a
knife I 544
30 haswell cpu and even though it's
locked you have a z97 maximus seven hero
so you could have maybe gotten an unlock
sku processors to do some overclocking
that would have been pretty sweet but
for whatever reason you opted out of it
out of that where whether it was just to
save a bit of funds or you just weren't
aware that you couldn't overclock on
that ship or or maybe you just really
like the aesthetic of the z97 board
didn't care for overclocking back that
could be an option to so many theories
Illuminati confirmed and then you've got
a really nice black and theme going here
those freaking cables man those cables
are fantastic I don't know if those are
cable mod or if they're actually fantex
I know fantex make some really nice
sleeved extensions as well but hot damn
it just those kinds of extensions just
make your system they take it to a next
level to another level really make it
look kind of pro grade and I love your
choice of vram I think the DRAM that
hyperx getting it in red and black was a
super good idea it just matches so
perfectly with with your video card and
the sleeve cables the motherboard
everything meshes so well and i also
like your your SSD there that you did a
little bit of modding spray-painted that
sucker red I think that's a really nice
choice you didn't try to get too fancy
with it you're just like nope doing it
clean read the crucial be x 100 and you
know it's not the prettiest drive the bx
100 it's super affordable it's a good
performer for the price but it really
would have ruined the look of your
overall system had you not done anything
to it so i really like how you uh how
you modded that thing good good paint
job however taking a look again at the
money shot um my big gripe with this
system is the cpu cooler and i don't
expect you to go out and buy span anyth
anything more than like 30 40 bucks on a
cpu cooler because you can't overclock
your chip anyway so what's the point
right at the same time intel stock
cooler is butt ugly and
you knew that and you took some steps to
try to rectify that issue aesthetically
by taping the wire that ugly nasty green
blue and yellow fugly wire that's
connected to that stock cooler as well
as a cover-up that center sticker which
is equally hideous um while the while
you get an a-plus for effort I have to
say the execution here is probably the
shortcoming of your system because from
afar you can't really tell all too much
the naked eye can't see see all that
great but when you take a closer look it
definitely looks a bit amateur I would
say I don't know if you use tape or
paint or spray paint to cover that
Center sticker but it's kind of bubbly
and it looks like a makes me want like a
hot fresh oven-baked pizza doesn't look
the greatest man I gotta say so I'm
gonna have to duck you some points for
that I mean if you just went out and
spent thirty forty bucks on a cpu cooler
that you didn't have to do any
modifications to and risk the chance of
it not looking all that clean in the end
result I think that might have been a
wiser choice or just get another stock
cooler and try again but we've got one
more picture to look at and it's your
cable management let's take a look all
right hey you know what i think you know
i can see you you've definitely worked
with the the tie-downs and you've kind
of got these three pillars of cables
going all the same direction it's all
you know parallel and stuff um and thank
God thank God you got some sleeved
extensions cuz those cables are just Oh
condiments all around am i right Jesus
um so yeah you know good job on that and
quite frankly I think this is probably
the best cable management job that we've
seen out of the three finalists it just
it just looks overall cleaner every
cable is kind of grouped to it's part of
a group there's no stray single fan
cable dangling like like I saw on the
number one and two granted I feel like
maybe some
room for improvement is available for
the power supply shroud area but
considering that you know these are
sleeved extensions you're sometimes
doubling the length of your power supply
cable by doing so I did a pretty nice
job not too shabby bra mr. Han oh um and
I don't know if oh yeah okay so my wife
is on it she's she's way more on top of
it than I am she's already posted links
in chat for you guys to go ahead and
check out all the pictures all the pics
of the three finalists that we've just
talked about and that'll give you a
closer up look and a better idea of who
you want to vote for because right now
it's voting round it's voting time baby
so also she should be posting the voting
link to the straw poll where you guys
will vote to see who wins the 500 grand
prize oh yeah yeah everyone say hi
Heather everyone say hi hi Heather Miami
so yeah she'll she'll go ahead and post
the straw poll link in chat so you guys
can actually vote on whichever pc you
think is the best and make sure to look
at the systems carefully guys and also
consider what the specs are not so much
in terms of which ones more high-end but
how well they're matched you know um
think of it like if someone was giving
you one of these rigs which one would
you want that's kind of how I would
probably vote on it you know because
that way it's not all about aesthetics
it's not just which one looks the best
it's like I'm getting the system I want
it to be well-rounded I want it to be
you know well maybe that's not the best
because then you'll be like well I just
want the highest end PC relatively
speaking just just do I don't care just
pick the one you like it's let's not
overcomplicate things guys let's just
you know let's keep it simple keep it
simple stupid on that note why don't we
go ahead and take a look again at our
sponsor for today hui use and by the way
i'll put up the the lower thirds
thumbnails for our contestants 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
they're so fantex our sponsor and then
right after we do our sponsor spot we're
going to go ahead and check out the
results if you guys want to be more
suspenseful then don't look at the
results until I show them to you because
that that will create more suspense or
don't look at chat for the people who
are spoilers spoiler alerts all of you
but phanteks i was talking briefly about
their RGB LED adapter which they just
released and here it is and this is a
basically it's just if you have a
compatible motherboard as a lot of
motherboards nowadays are starting to
come out with RGB LED headers on them so
if you already have some RGB strips and
you've got a compatible motherboard
check out this adapter from fantex yo
check it out y'all the the Maximus 8
extreme Maximus formula extreme is one
of those high-end boards that is
compatible with this adapter which is
super cool and if you happen to be a fan
text case owner they are currently doing
a RGB LED adapter promo where you could
get one of the adapters for free
considering that you have a eligible
fantex case and compatible motherboard
the compatible cases include the enthu
lux the mini XL or their new eclipse
p400 compatible motherboards include the
asus maximus 8 formula and the Maximus 8
hero alpha so if you guys have like a
combination of those two things then you
can actually send in you know proof of
purchase for both those items to fantex
at support at fantex USA com again links
to all this stuff is in the description
and they'll send you a free LED adapter
RGB LED adapter which is pretty sweet
yep there's also links in the
description for their Eclipse p400 MP
400s you want to check that out thank
you again super super super kind of you
guys to sponsor me Thank You fantex I
love you I want to make babies with all
of your cases they're all so sexy but on
that note guys haha you know it's you
know it's dramatic business time you
know it's a voting time when i cue the
dark moody music because um that's what
we're doing right now we're revealing ah
the winner oh this is intense I'm
purposely not even looking at chat right
now because I don't want to know who
wins until I click the results button
here so who's gonna win all the moneys
for five hundred dollars in either a
steam or amazon gift card this is
intense guys but you guys have voted you
gave it some good thought and the person
you decided the winner is is Han oh wow
by a landslide holy moly look at that
sixty-eight percent of the votes Wow
holy bejeezus man I was not expecting
that much of a landslide with any of the
three systems I thought they were all
great um but hey you know don't you know
that uh that the the crowd has spoken I
am beyond words I congratulations Hannah
honestly your your system was really
kick ass man even despite the cpu cooler
there it's not look at the cable
management does your victory image
that's just that's just wrong look at
this look at this thing guys I think
those just everything's composed so well
the SSD is such a nice touch those cable
sleeves everyone congratulate hano on
his victory you sir are a winner of a
five-hundred-dollar gift card i will be
getting in contact with you via email so
i keep tabs on that and hey guys that
pretty much concludes the season finale
of booted what season 1 complete dog
guys guys thank you so much for being
here this is exciting um and I don't see
too many I don't see much of a rage and
chat about quality issues choppiness so
I'm really happy that silent night good
ol Silent Night pulled through y'all
which is really strange because um never
had a problem with the half stacker
build for awesome hardware but I think
maybe that this
xsplit presentation just has so many
more images and and things going on that
perhaps requires a bit more horsepower
but thank you silent night I do
appreciate you you are loved and I
appreciate all of you guys as well thank
you all so much for coming out in case
you wanted to catch this live and you're
watching the rebroadcast you can catch
booted live every Monday not every
Monday but mondays at five-thirty p.m.
pacific on gaming youtube com just go to
my youtube channel or follow me on
twitter for updates i'll give you links
to the direct video remember guys for
months that have five mondays in them
there's not going to be a show on that
fifth monday which is like this month
there's five there's five mondays in
February because February's weird like
that so booted season two will actually
return March seventh that's when you
guys will be able to see which probably
take this down now the very next episode
of this series and we're going to be
coming with five new contestants the
first set of our brand new 15 entries
which is really exciting it's also going
to be a budget edition so rather than
mid-range we're going to see ya you know
ketchup and mustard welcome all ketchup
and mustard is welcome to the budget
series the budget season of booted next
month because you know I want to give
all you guys who have some lower end
more economical systems a chance to
upgrade that rig and and then maybe you
could enter for like another mid-range
season in the future that'd be funny and
then and then win that one and then win
500 more dollars and then enter the
high-end edition season 10 whenever that
happens but yeah I don't know I'm saying
