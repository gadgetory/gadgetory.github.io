with awesomesauce Network welcome back
to the channel you are watching my very
last custom water-cooled build log of my
custom water-cooled build series where I
document my entire experience from start
to finish of my very first ever custom
water-cooled build and those of you who
have been sticking with me from the very
beginning or even if you just joined in
the middle thank you so much for staying
tuned and for following me through all
of these amazing experiences that I've
had when building this system but of
course you don't want to hear me ramble
on for too much longer you want to see
the finished product don't you I know
you do I know you do so here it is in
all of its glory take a good look it's
like the camera centered there I can
finally say this thing is done which Wow
I can actually say those words it's kind
of hard to imagine but there it is and
let me just kind of briefly explain to
you guys what I've done since the last
bill blog I've done a few things and I
didn't really document them all that
much because of the wedding and the
honeymoon that I recently came back from
I didn't really have time to do many
time lapses of that sort of thing but
it's all kind of the same stuff that
you've already seen in this series so I
didn't want to bore you guys to death
but here it is the first thing that I've
changed was the hard line tubing I
pretty much took out all of the hard
line tubing that I had initially put in
apart from that tube right there and
that little one up there those were fine
but as far as the big three the one
that's going from the the 360 red to the
CPU and the CPU to the terminal and the
terminal to the pump
of course I kind of did that backwards
because it's actually flowing clockwise
but there you guys have it
I actually fine-tuned the tubing just
the way I liked it and it's it looks a
lot cleaner as a result I think the
bends are a lot smoother there is one
little tiny evb bubble right here on the
corner but it's almost unnoticeable and
especially with the fluid in there you
can't really tell too much unless you're
really trying to look for it but you can
also see that instead of having the 45
degree angle that went from the pump to
the terminal here I just kind of did a
two right angles or actually three one
to wait one two three I can count I can
count math I don't even so I did three
writing
here I think that just looks really nice
with the the right angles of the other
tubes I think it just matches really
nicely also remember this tube kind of
went out way too far and it kind of went
down right around here when the side
panel window was on you couldn't even
really see it and now it Peaks through
perfectly
I think the sizing is just spot-on I'm
actually really impressed with myself
and also I painted the the x99 cover
plate in pink right back there as many
of you guys suggested thank you so much
for your suggestions I'm really happy
with how that turned out as well as
small as it is it's just it's just a
tiny detail that you wouldn't think
makes a big difference but it really
does and it just adds to the theme that
much more apart from that I will say
that some of the sleeving here the paint
has come off of the Pink's leaving that
I have initially custom painted you can
kind of see the white peeking through
and I think that's just because when I
was trying to train the cables and
getting my finger oils all over it I
think some of the paint rubbed off but
that's nothing that a little touch-up
can't fix I'm just gonna get a the same
color paint and a little paintbrush and
just kind of go over it really lightly
just to fill in those gaps and it should
be good to go apart from that the cables
themselves are still getting trained I
need to get some cable combs throw in
there just to make them a bit more tidy
I think they could be a bit better
especially this one at the bottom I
really haven't messed too much with it
but you can kind of see they're
overlapping there I think the other
thing that I added in here or I know the
other thing that I had in here since
last time was the LED strips so I've got
one two strips right here and these are
the cheapy pink LEDs that I got off of
Amazon I would have loved to have bit
BitFenix strips in here especially their
new magnetic ones but they don't offer
them in pink just purple ironically
these pink LED strips are kind of more
on the purple side than pink or I should
say it's a kind of a fair blend of the
two colors so they're not exactly the
same color as the fluid itself but it
does look pretty nice now I did try to
use white LEDs for this system and I
just didn't like the look of it I
actually really like how this pink /
purple color kind of transforms the look
of the system at nighttime or when the
system is powered on and I think it kind
of gives it a dual personality whether
it's on or off and I kind of like that
transformative aspect of it and I'll
show you guys what that looks like in
just a minute
you can see here I have - I had to put
some scotch tape some really nasty
looking scotch tape here
because these LED strips are so cheap
when I actually pulled the adhesive
backing strip off of it this guy this
little strip here it actually took the
adhesive with it so there's actually no
sticky stuff on the back of this LED
strip right here which is why I have the
ugly scotch tape of course I will be
replacing this tape with something a
little bit more permanent and less tacky
looking in the near future
maybe some electrical tape or maybe I'll
even glue the district down here this
one as well this this one does did
retain its adhesive backing but as you
can tell it's not the sturdiest so I did
have to have a piece of tape here again
I'll replace that and I do have some
twist ties going routing around the back
here through the the ventilation holes
where that were the 140 or 120
millimeter fan would be just to keep it
tied down a bit more but when it's
powered on it looks great you can see
this really ugly cable going down here
underneath the power supply and out the
back ground it's right there
going to molex connectors I don't like
the look of this at all I could paint
this black for a more stealth look but
I'm gonna leave it as is for now because
when the side panels on you can't see it
at all
you can just kind of see the the mid
portion of the power supply right here
and then it kind of cuts off you have to
look really at a steep angle to actually
see anything down here so I'm okay with
it for now but nonetheless I'll probably
be doing something with this red cable
in the future you said it took the EVGA
sticker off of the power supply just to
give it a more stealthy look as well and
a couple more things that I wanted to
mention about this is the memory you
might notice that the memory has changed
it was the RIP jaws for from g.skill and
now it's the HyperX predator kit from
Kingston or HyperX as their new branding
is is so named the reason why I went for
these is because they're matte instead
of the rip just four which is a kind of
a glossy finish I didn't really like the
glossy look inside of this case I think
the matte just makes it look a bit more
stealthy as well and the taller heat
spreaders spreaders I think adds a lot
more depth to the case at the same time
so I don't know I think the the RIP
drawers for were a bit lower and they
kind of blend it in with the the CPU
water block there with the the predator
heat spreaders I just think it looks
pretty badass and I really like the look
of it overall now before I talk your
ears off even more I think I'm just
going to shut up for a minute and put
this damn side panel on so you can get a
look at how sick
see the LEDs look in the system alright
so here it is guys all lit up powered on
and you'll also probably notice I didn't
mention this I wanted it to be a
surprise I've got some under lighting
right there in the same color as the
inside of the case I actually put two
LED strips on the bottom of the define s
just like that and it just kind of gives
it a nice little under glow which I
think looks really sexy I don't know let
me let me know you guys think in the in
the comments but I really like the added
effect that it gives of course I have
the cables routed back here again with
the ugly scotch tape that's going both
both wires are going into this PCI slot
the very bottom PCI slot and that's then
routing in one of the little holes
underneath the motherboard behind the
motherboard tray and into a separate
molex connector one thing I will note is
that I would like to swap out this LED
in the future if that's possible and get
the same color LED in here so when it's
powered on it's just a little bit more
cohesive with the color scheme and also
the hideous sli bridge that I have in
here will be shortly soon replaced with
an EVGA bridge that I will be doing a
custom LED in that as well J's to sense
does an excellent tutorial on how to do
that and I'm actually looking forward to
seeing how that looks in this system as
well but enough for aesthetics why don't
we take a look at the business end flip
this case around and take a look at the
cable management that I've had to work
with alright so here's a look at the
back end with all the cable management
of course in the define s you have all
three hard drive mounts at the back of
the case behind the motherboard tray and
I do have all three of those populated
with WD black drives so of course that
limits the amount of cable management I
can do from this side of the case
onward apart from maybe in between the
drives where I can fit a few cables in
there but that really had had me it was
really challenging actually to kind of
get all the cables in here especially
for a custom water-cooled system with
multiple GPUs you're dealing with a lot
more cabling especially with extensions
that even adds more pressure to the
situation but I think I managed quite
nicely the velcro straps of the define s
definitely came in handy as well as the
multiple tie-down points obviously there
was no tie-down point here because it's
a big cutout for the motherboard tray so
this is a my ATX along with the the
state of day the cables are kind of just
here but they do press against quite
easily when the side panels on and the
side panel does go on fairly easily you
kind of got to push it a little bit but
it goes on no problem and that's pretty
much all I have to say about this system
in general because again it's done yeah
I'm so glad it's done guys this has been
an amazing experience I keep saying that
and I really appreciate you guys
following me every step of the way
leaving those comments and suggestions
you guys have helped me build this
system more than you think
there are a lot of times where I was
just at a loss of what to do or how to
go forward and I asked you guys for
comments and suggestions and you guys
were really helpful in your ideas that
you gave me I used a lot of them so
thank you guys so much as well as all of
my sponsors you guys know who they are
that's going to do it I don't know what
to do now now that now that the system
is done I think I'll probably just
continue making other tech videos that
aren't about this computer so stay tuned
for that and feel free to toss me a like
on the video if you enjoyed it guys
give me a comment leave me some love
