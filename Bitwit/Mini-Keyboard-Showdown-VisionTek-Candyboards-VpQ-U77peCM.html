back when I was still working at Newegg
I won this mini keyboard from vision
tech at our annual company picnic and
have been using it to navigate my trusty
htpc ever since at this year's CES I had
the pleasure of meeting some of the fine
folks at vision tech who were kind
enough to send me another one of their
mini keyboards to try out so today I am
starting an all-out Civil War by pitting
my tried-and-true visiontek keyboard
against its own blood to see which one
I'll be using from here on out
now while both contenders belong to
vision Tech's candy board line of mini
keyboards they each differ greatly in
respect to their look feel and
functionality so let's see how my
current keyboard the mini wing stacks up
against its new challenger the nine zero
zero three three five
well if product branding was a category
I'd have to give this round to the
keyboard that's not one digit shy of a
phone number but diving right in the 335
retails for 65 bucks on vision Tech's
website $10 more than the mini wing
priced at 55 but you can find both
boards for around 40 bucks on Amazon the
mini wing has 79 keys and works with
your Windows Mac Linux RedHat Ubuntu
Fedora and Android systems as well as
Xbox 360 and ps3 so console gamers can
experience the mind-blowing ability to
type while gaming it runs on a 2.4
gigahertz wireless radio frequency and
transmits its signal to an included USB
dongle receiver that can be stored
behind the rear panel of the keyboard
when not in use also in the back is a
removable 810 milliamp lithium-ion
battery with a three-and-a-half hour
charge time using the included mini USB
cable and port located on the left side
of the keyboard when full the battery
can retain its charge for up to 28 days
of non-use acclaim I can confidently
attest to as even with daily use it
tends to last longer than most tiny Tom
Logan videos the 3 3 5 sports 69 Keys 10
less than the mini wing though both
boards are exactly identical in size and
weight with the exception of the mini
wing being slightly slimmer around the
edges the keyboard also supports all of
the same operating systems in addition
to Android and iOS mobile devices
courtesy of the keyboards Bluetooth
interface which offers more flexibility
and security than the mini wings RF
Connect
having used an RF keyboard for the last
few years I hadn't really considered the
benefits of having a Bluetooth mini
keyboard until now while it's certainly
not an everyday users task
I found the ability to control the
teleprompter app on my Nexus 7
incredibly useful although having a
mouse cursor on your smartphone is so
lame it'll probably get you kicked out
of the Bluetooth headset club if you're
looking to connect the 335 to a PC that
doesn't have built-in bluetooth there's
a USB adapter stored inside of the
keyboard that could be unsheath from a
stealthy compartment on top the 335
shares the same battery specs with its
counterparts however the battery on this
model is not removable unless you want
to do some manual rewiring like the mini
wing it does have a mini USB port on the
left hand side for charging with the
included cable and I should also mention
that both candy boards can be used while
charging and our plug-and-play with no
software installation required I'm
particularly fond of the mini wings
matte plastic body and soft rubberized
keys which provide some much-needed grip
for my oily thumbs
additionally the wing branding stems
from the board's organ AMA clay out of
having the touch pad in the middle there
by splitting the keys into two separate
wings this puts all the alpha keys
within close range of both thumbs for
comfortable and fluid typing there's
also a one to two millimeters facing
between each of the keys which sounds
like a lot less than it really is when
you're talking about single finger
precision white LED backlighting ensures
accurate keystrokes and dimly lit
environments which is an absolute must
in my opinion for keyboards paired with
an HTTP see in the top right hand corner
is a dedicated button to toggle the
backlighting on and off for LED
indicators in the top left corner
monitor the devices backlighting USB
connection battery capacity and charging
status a full row of F keys lined the
top of the keyboard along with secondary
functions including RF matching print
screen volume mute up-and-down Windows
key male shortcuts touchpad rotation
Media Center calculator multimedia
navigation and delete other secondary
functions across the board include
Control Alt Delete page up-and-down and
four level DPI adjustment for the touch
pad a great feature to see given the
various screen resolutions you may
encounter the all traffic key allows you
to use alpha keys to navigate programs
which can be faster than using the touch
pad in certain situations the touch pad
supports cursor movement as well as
single and double tapping for left click
and double click functionality
based on your preference the pad
rotation key can change the orientation
of the touchpad 90 degrees clockwise so
the device can be held and operated
vertically much like a standard TV
remote beneath the pad our left and
right mouse click buttons and a browser
shortcut button surrounded by four arrow
keys that can function as scroll buttons
to aid in things like web browsing the
device also has an auto sleep feature
that shuts down the keyboard after a few
minutes of inactivity and can be then
woken up after any key press the 335
supports a plastic body as well but with
a glossy ER finish that makes the keys a
bit more slippery unlike the mini wing
all the keys are grouped together with
the touch pad on the right hand side the
keys are laid side by side with
virtually no spacing between them and
can also light up white using the
secondary function of the f1 key here we
see the backlighting on the 335 is
notably brighter than my mini wing
though neither is too bright nor too dim
and this could also be due to the fact
that I've already been using the LEDs on
the mini wing for two-plus years now in
the top left corner of the 335 are the
same LED indicators we saw earlier right
next to a bluetooth pairing button and a
number of F keys with secondary
functions for backlighting print screen
while you mute up and down multimedia
playback and delete you also get the
same functions like Windows key
90-degree touchpad rotation control out
the leads and page up and down the
touchpad is essentially the same here as
it was with the mini wing with movement
and tap to click functionality and again
with left and right mouse click buttons
and arrow slash scroll Keys now a few
things I noticed missing from this board
that were on the mini wing are a few of
the app shortcuts which who cares and
any element of dpi adjustment which I
kind of care this is a really useful
feature to have for a trackpad and I'm
not sure why it was omitted from the 335
given the similarly priced mini wing but
wait this keyboard has a trick up its
sleeve because everyone knows you can't
resist a mini keyboard that has a laser
pointer unfortunately I can't show it in
action because I broke the bottom firing
button when taking the backplate off
which apparently you're not supposed to
do nevertheless this feature is sure to
be handy for things like giving
PowerPoint presentations in the
classroom or at the office but now that
we've pretty much covered what each of
these devices can do let's move on to
the final round to see which one does it
better now it's true that the broad
application of radiofrequency can't
really compete with the convenience of
Bluetooth due to the plethora of today's
devices that
already have Bluetooth technology
built-in chances are you won't even need
to use the three three fives USB adapter
to connect to most of the devices in
your house which also means you'll have
one more port available for all of your
other USB gadgets connecting via
bluetooth and having the ability to
easily switch between devices makes the
three three five far more adaptable than
its contender now that being said the
mini Winx 2.4 gigahertz signal stays
right on par with its Bluetooth
counterpart in terms of responsiveness
range and reliability
unlike infrared and much like bluetooth
RF waves don't require a line of sight
between the transmitter and the receiver
to work so even with the USB dongle
plugged into the back of my htpc with
several layers of hardware between them
the mini wing up held a strong
connection with no visible differences
in performance with the 335 now when it
comes to typing the mini wing works
beautifully the wing design is very
comfortable in the hand and the buttons
even emit a satisfying click when
bottoming out and upon release allowing
for a somewhat tactile typing experience
that feels great with the rubberized
coating the touchpad functions great all
around with precise cursor movement and
tap to click actions but having the pad
in the middle of the keyboard forces you
to reach a bit with either thumb which
isn't the most ideal as a result I found
using my index finger to be a better
option and even more comfortable was to
rotate the touchpad 90 degrees and use
the device vertically it makes sense if
the mini wing could stay in this mode
permanently but unfortunately the
touchpad defaults to its original
orientation every time the keyboard is
turned off and on or falls asleep which
makes using it regularly a minor hassle
also worth mentioning is that the arrow
and scroll buttons don't change
orientation with the touchpad which
definitely would have left me impressed
a great addition to consider for future
iterations a final critique with the
mini wing is that I would have liked to
see the frequently used volume control
buttons on the right side of the
keyboard within reaching distance of the
right thumb since the left thumb will
already be busy holding down the
function key now while having a much
more adept Bluetooth connection the 335
is not without its faults the keyboard
really pales in comparison to the mini
wing when it comes to typing not only
did the keys lack any rubberized grip
but I found that having virtually no
space between the keys led to more
frequent typos even worse is that having
the touchpad to the right of all the
keys forces your right thumb to stretch
across the board in order to type
effectively while you do get a
satisfying
click on the way down the buttons don't
feel quite as tactile upon release
making them feel mushy er than the mini
wing this is likely attributed to less
actuation distribution due to the three
three 5s larger Keys now where the
typing experience and button layout
falls short however is where the
touchpad succeeds when held horizontally
the pad is in the perfect location at
least for me as a right-handed user
vertical orientation also works well
with the laser pointer button being
within comfortable reach of your right
thumb or left index finger granting you
ambidexterity when giving a presentation
for instance and apart from having a
fixed dpi the touch pad here performs
just as well as it does on the mini wing
now again I wish the arrow buttons were
linked to the touchpad rotation feature
but at the very least their flat surface
makes them so much easier to use than
the mini wings awkwardly shaped arrow
keys on that note I think I have finally
come to a decision on which keyboard I
think is the better option so from the
candy board line is it the RF mini wing
or the Bluetooth 9 zero zero three five
all things considered my mini keyboard
of choice in most scenarios would be the
RF mini wing while each keyboard bested
the other in multiple categories the
superior typing experience on the mini
wing is what won me over in the end
after all these are QWERTY keyboards
were talking about so their ability to
type effectively is a huge part of what
makes or breaks them even with the
absence of bluetooth support I would
still recommend the mini wing for those
of you looking to use it with an HTTP
see if you can afford to hog up one of
your USB ports the keyboards app
shortcuts and dpi adjustment are a treat
to have and just help create a more
robust solution for such a scenario for
mobile devices or in a workplace
environment the 335 certainly might have
the edge for professionals who give
frequent presentations where cursor
movement and mouse clicking is needed
more than actual typing not to mention
that handy laser pointer I broke now
vision tech made a Bluetooth mini wing
and implemented all the suggestions I
had mentioned earlier I'd probably kick
both of these keyboards to the curb and
flag this video myself from being
irrelevant so what do you guys think
which of these keyboards stood out to
you the most and why also let me know if
you have a different mini keyboard in
mind that you'd like me to check out in
the future but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
