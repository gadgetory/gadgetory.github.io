on guys welcome back to the channel hope
you're all doing well so this is a
follow up video to my initial launch
video that i did for RX vega 56 and 64
right off the bat I have to fess up that
I misjudged my testing methodology for
that video and all those benchmarks that
were run simply because at the time like
I mentioned I did not have a press
driver for allowing me to overclock Vega
manually so I decided to run it in the
turbo profile within AMD watt man up
against manually overclocked gtx 1070
and gtx 1080 which i in hindsight should
not have done and while the turbo
profile did add sort of a boost to those
cards so the vega cards um it wasn't
quite the same as manually overclocking
biga myself so now that we have the
public driver on the AMD Radeon website
I actually went in and did some manually
overclocking with Vega 56 which is what
we're focusing on today and redid all
the benchmarks comparing it against a
manually overclocked gtx 1070 so let me
just walk you through exactly what I did
AMD wat man for starters is a little bit
funky right now as a software I was able
to crank the slider the core clock
percentage slider all the way up to 20%
really without crashing under load and I
probably could have gone further but I
didn't because I figured something was
kind of fishy and even the peak clock
speeds that were being reported within
wot man were reflecting a 20% gain
whenever I cranked the slider up that
high however when doing some validation
within 3dmark firestrike extreme I
noticed that our performance hit a wall
at around 12% so that's pretty much what
I kept it at for all of today's test was
a 12% overclock to RX Vega 56 the card
did get fairly warm under load maxing
out at 86 degrees Celsius I made sure to
keep a close eye on the clock speeds and
it seemed to stay right at 780
megahertz so I did not observe any
throttling throughout the entirety of
our fire strike extreme testing
additionally we are using the same test
bed that we used in the last video so
the Intel Core i 970 900 X overclocked
to 4.5 gigahertz on all cores on top of
the next to 99 gaming Pro carbon and
that was also running 32 gigs of g.skill
Trident Z tr4 at 3200 speed it's also
worth noting that I omitted 4k
benchmarks from today simply because
we're not focusing on Vega 56 or the GTX
1080 and at the performance levels of
the GTX 970 in Vega 56 pretty much we're
not too concerned with 4k performance at
that point so without further ado ladies
and gentlemen here are the round 2
benchmarks for our gtx 1070 in Vega 56
manually overclocked cards
all right evidently we can see a pretty
nice gain from manually overclocking our
Vega 56 as opposed to just running it in
turbo mode which is why we're seeing
these two cards compete now really
closely neck-and-neck I mean overall the
gtx 1070 still has a point seven four
percent lead over the RX Vegas 56 but
it's just so marginal I mean I pretty
much consider this a draw simply because
the cards are trading blows throughout
all of our tests and really what this
comes down to now is its price at the
time of filming this video you can find
a gtx 1070 on amazon or new egg at the
low end for about 440 u.s. dollars
whereas all hell is now breaking loose
with vega pricing i mean at the time of
launch we did see vega 56 retail for
$400 as promised and it's 64 for $500 as
promised but now we're seeing all these
articles pop up stating that these were
just launched prices for early adopters
and that now that the first wave of
stock is gone we're going to start to
see the actual MSRP for these cards
appear which is going to be $100 more
for each model so $500 for RX vega 56
and $600 for air-cooled vega 64 if these
are the true MSRP s which by the way
none of us reviewers received any of
this information upfront at AMD tech day
or in any sort of emails from AMD
directly or their PR companies so this
is all of a shock and surprise to me as
well that AMD sort of flipping the
switch on the pricing here and if that
is really the case that's really
unfortunate because it was looking
really good it was looking like a really
good value good bang for the buck at
least for Vega 56 and now if it's for
$500 I mean forget about it just get a
gtx 1070 for you know almost $60 cheaper
now it does appear that if you opt for
one of the Radeon packs those bundles
that come with the two free games or the
horizon 7 CPU motherboard or the monitor
then you do get rx Vega for the early
launch price but that still seems sort
of anti-consumer for users who want just
a standalone card and I feel like the
whole trying to ward off cryptocurrency
miners seems just like a royal excuse
for everything that's happening right
now so I don't know I feel like I want
to hear more straight from the horse's
mouth before I make any other statements
or claims about what's going on but it
definitely does seem
a bit shady especially since none of us
reviewers were made aware that these
prices would be increasing immediately
after the initial stock ran out at
anything right guys I'll keep a close
eye on it for you and I'm sure Paul and
I will have something to say about it on
a future awesome hardware but that's
going to do it for now guys sorry again
for the old batch of benchmarks
hopefully this sort of makes up for that
a little bit I apologize I'm only human
I screw up all the time but hopefully
you guys understand just that I'm an
idiot be sure to toss me I like on the
