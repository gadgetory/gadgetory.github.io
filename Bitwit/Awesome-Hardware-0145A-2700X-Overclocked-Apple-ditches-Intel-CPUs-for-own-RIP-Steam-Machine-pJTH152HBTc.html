Paul that's really creepy
I won't say it just because I don't like
it not not out of respect to you but
just because yeah you don't listen to
program and we did the livestream it's
the most like a pathetic thing but can
hate a person because you certainly when
you're suddenly it just happens to
destroy your confidence it's like oh my
god that's what we sound like happy how
could anyone be watching or listening to
us right now there's gonna be a term for
like a phobia the phobia of your own
voice of like hearing your own voice
there's got to be a term for that
someone's like Google that my voice of
phobia imagine spaceship for descent is
doing their with the therapist I have
you freaking my voice my voice phobia
okay
are we allowed to both yes we should be
like welcome to awesome Hardware sayeth
the episode 145 45 a we made it if
you're joining us just now thank you and
welcome this is a fun technique oh that
Paul like to do every single Tuesday at
5:30 p.m. Pacific time right here on
twitch TV slash awesome hardware we also
stream the show in two halves on our
respective YouTube channels this week
the first half is on my channel and then
once it's over and about an hour or so
you can go ahead and head over to Paul's
channel you get that a link for that in
my video description or you can go to
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware we
like to have fun have a couple drinks
and you're drinking with us then cheers
to you also occasionally we might swear
or say some potty words or we have a
potty mouth occasionally so if you have
little ones around or sensitive hearing
be aware responsible drink responsibly
um you know if you're watching our
stream like while you're driving right
now then don't
have a drink do this stop don't stop
that and just just treat it like a
podcast don't actually watch a side of
the roads not worth it
this is not worth it family member
or or good friend yes and just hum your
way through it okay but all you probably
have a decent like LTE connection if
you're streaming us right now I mean
yeah it's not kudos to you for that yeah
that's definitely nothing to scoff at
and then um we also sell things on our
stores mine is bit with tech slash store
there we also find a link for that in my
video description our good friend and
moderator self processing will also be
blowing up chat with some links to both
of our stores you can find the new rip
gamepad design in my store which is a
fantastic design I actually need to get
one of myself is that so I can wear it
on streem and show you guys give you
guys a live demo for that shirt but it's
a poor little poor little Xbox
controller being I don't know what the
word would be assaulted
at least verbally definitely assaulted
and possibly verbally assaulted by the
keyboard and physically assaulted by the
mouse and mouse it's a scary situation
it's very terrifying but probably a
super comfortable shirt to wear and then
a bunch of other stuff you can go ahead
and browse see what you like Paul's
channel assaulting sewer is Paul's
hardware dotnet what do you got Paul
look at these look at these lightweight
zipper hoodies Kyle obviously winter has
passed um you know winters we've made it
through so you're looking for something
to keep you just a little bit warmer and
the lightweight zipper hoody is exactly
that thing available in a variety of I
think there's a couple different
versions now there's just the one
just the one I also have polo shirts our
art our merchandise guy John is so good
at his job we can't even keep up with
our own stores like he just keeps adding
things and it's and it just keeps making
this site better though they're all very
high quality products we still give them
such as the Imperial pint glasses here
that we were drinking from today yes in
case you're wondering I these are the
only two Imperial pint glasses of mine
that I have ever had these have never
needed to be replaced the logo is still
just as fresh
and good-looking as it was the day we
get them I have I have glasses that are
the same quality of my store - we will
shout Johnson at you at the end of the
show if if you happen to buy anything
from either of our stores if you buy
something from both of us you'll get a
double Johnson
that's a Johnson from both me and Paul
at the same time both of our Johnson's
one of you alright let's move on that's
outside like after 145 shows that's a
fresh way of putting it thank you
alright alright so my half of the show
admitting Lee is pretty simple we're
gonna start with some pimp my PC we have
six of you guys lined up here and then
we're gonna just dive into some tech
news so for starters we've got Rex oh
wait I'm sorry can we call it the beer
because I got beer I want people to know
I got cool beer so mine's the it's a dig
my earth double India Pale Ale - double
IPA from brewery West is actually a
recommendation from the guy at the store
and I did not realize until I actually
brought it to the cash register that it
was twenty dollars for a four pack of
these my god four of these Mexicans so
it better be damn good it better be good
yeah I mean while I'm drinking sob
comics out sob in this case stands for
son of a Baptist this is from epic
Brewing Company in Denver Colorado that
one I did not get a recommendation for
but I did look up the beer advocate
rating on my phone and it got a 4.2 out
of 5 so it's galerias I'm trying to find
the percentage listing on here and I'm
not fine oh eight percent it's a percent
that's nice
the ABG lytes mid-range for us did I
beat you it's a double IPA so I might
finish this wait it doesn't even it
doesn't even sometimes we're matching
today I have an 8 to call might that
sweet I shall mention this is a hazy
double IPA I'm still learning what that
means but hazy IPAs are all the rage
these they can't see through it
I guess yeah it has that's very
self-explanatory took the opacity slider
hmm and they slid it up the opacity oh
you would probably even like this
problem I bet I will it's really good
you have what next what we'll trade on
the next piece get all the beer I'm next
okay certainly thank you
alright let's dive into our first victim
here we go my PC its Rex good ol Rex Rex
is but he's got an as rock fatality z97
ex killer motherboard with an i7 4790k
overclocked 4.8 gigahertz solid of
course their invention c70 case really
liked that case even though it's old of
course their H 100 ia IO 16 gigs of
Kingston HyperX fury 1866 megahertz ddr3
- GT x 1080 t is super clock two's in
sli SC - does he mean oh you mean super
super Clark maybe yeah it's yeah okay
and then and then a bunch of other stuff
okay cool storage um sc2 you can see the
sc2 right here I didn't realize that
they started branding it SC 2sc it was
SSC and then I think they realized that
super super clock sound sounded a little
silly so they made it as superclocked
NSC - I believe I believe that's the
reason I'm wrong Nvidia and GG that's
watching the livestream Jake Jake next
text me and I'm sorry okay alright so
I'm so looking I like your color scheme
very very solid we have all right here's
one of those rare cases where you you
don't lose much with the ketchup ketchup
and mustard granted we got a 24-pin
extension here and that that does you
well cuz you not just with your memory
and your motherboard accents I would I
don't know what do you do does he need
does he need a matching extension for
the eight pin up there that's absolutely
yeah I think he needs Riddick's like the
way I see it you need at leat it's the
trifecta of cabling okay you need the 24
pin the 8 pin ups if it's visible some
cases you can't really see it anyway and
then PCI Express you need your free
graphics card
you need they couldn't up the a or
windows good an update good shack
windows oh god I think I think you
should get two more extensions for those
other areas okay
especially for your GP because you've
got two cards and there's twice as much
cabling in that area so I think some
sleeving would really do you a solid
this is a minor thing but I feel like I
would want I won't watch like this and
go around the heatsink with this black
cable just I agree I like just a
preference it's not it's such a they
spent so much time on making the
heatsinks look nice it's a shame to
cover it up and you get a badass sli
bridge
I mean honestly for for just being
looped around here in the in out in the
open in the case your your your graphics
cards cables don't look too bad here on
the bottom
mmm-hmm they match the top so I don't
know you could you could zip tie them up
so they that kind of bundled together a
little bit you know I mean if you if
you're going for the detail work if
that's what you're looking for you again
overall like this is this has a really
nice appealing high-five to it I think I
would do like what I would do is like
I'd probably route the top cards cables
down to the bottom and then sort of
overlap the bottom cards cables with
with the top cable you know means so
that but I like how these top ones look
I mean that's relatively clean up and
they know it's very clean so I don't
mind the up on the top and down on the
bottom but I mean there's this it's it's
like always to skin a cat I imagine like
for you ladies out there there's
according to the YouTube analytics
there's 2% of you who are ladies are
watching like oh and I guess for guys
with long hair tooth like there's lots
of different ways of doing your hair
right okay Steve from the gamers
business would probably allocate that
clean exactly anyway also I'd like your
your ukulele over there
but okay alright thanks Rex
thank you very much Rex beautiful custom
crisis row crisis Roo risin 5 1600 3.7
gigahertz using the stock cooler do
next night 80 super clocks 1450
megahertz core 8 gig just a single a
kick stick of memory 3000 megahertz
though oh it's an overclocked single 8
gig stick interesting 1 terabyte
Barracuda so a couple hard drives 120
gig SSD asus prime be 350 + motherboard
geez 750 m power supply from
coolermaster and a Corsair spec alpha
case alright it's pretty solid build I
mean this can handle most things you
throw out a GTX 980 is still pretty
solid yeah and the risin 5 1600 I think
and keep up with it fairly well
especially since you haven't overclocked
oh wait no it's not overclocked it
doesn't say you have you should maybe
overclock it just just because you can
okay I think the the case that you're
using here the Corsair spoke out spec
alpha isn't the best for cable
management obviously doesn't have a
basement doesn't have a ton of room
behind the motherboard tray and even
though it does have some room like it
has all these cutouts on the right side
of the motherboard tray where you can
see the cables behind them even though
you've routed them in the proper place
so that's something you got to deal with
and then the 8 pin it doesn't have any
room over the motherboard itself to
route cables maybe it doesn't you just
didn't utilize it but it looks like your
8 pin EPS cable is stretched across your
motherboard and it doesn't look all that
creative from being honest not much you
can do about that to be honest if you
don't have any cut out above in that
area buy your connector but like to me
this first up I gotta say I feel like
this this this builds seems very good on
the price to performance prime sorry
price to performance metrics oh
definitely just just a nice balance
selection of hardware um definitely
definitely the single stick of RAM
situation needs to be remedied you're
probably if I'm guessing right you're
just holding off until Ram prices
hopefully normalize or come back down
even just a bit since they're still so
ridiculous right now but matching up
your HyperX
ran with what's another one is just it's
it's gonna do better overall you know in
a lot of different situations probably
beyond that you've got you've got a
budget power supply that's showing
pretty evidently here you've got a
budget case all the stuff Kyle said it
also suffers from the clear the clear
heels
clear clear the clear red LED fans in
the front I mean they're not horrible
since it's red and he got a black and
red thing going on so they're not the
worst thing I would I would I would
consider the power supply situation
before worrying about the fans where did
you put your SSD is that behind the
motherboard tray maybe I'm talking to
you like you can respond right now but
I'm just kind of thinking out loud it's
also is this a a network card this is
sound card I know there's a NIC I think
Asus makes a NIC that has already
anything cut its like that but anyway uh
recent matches but this yeah I mean I
don't know you like I said you got it
you got one of those really solid price
to performance builds so I hesitate to
say like yeah drop this money in this
money and all on aesthetics because
obviously you're going for a performance
here and this seems like a very nice as
formance wise gaming rig so yeah you can
tidy up the cable management you gotta
create the power supply cables but but
but good job crisis road solving kiss
all the bills what it comes down to good
job thanks okay Nick the the peasantry
Hut on Twitter with an i7 4790k based
system which has been overclocked to
five gigahertz at only one point three
volts Wow hey that's solid when it comes
to a 24/7 overclock I always pay
attention more to the voltage than to
what the max frequency you can hit as
long as he can keep the voltage down
that's that's the key for the 24/7 just
one the silicon lottery my friend 5.2
gigahertz was what he hit at
if you cranked it up to 1.42 I also like
how it automatically tagged at 5
gigahertz which is Jimmy that's Jimmy
yes good old Jimmy Oh Jimmy Jimmy and 5
gigahertz
oh that's so sad that that's a not used
account with 12 tweets
that's a cool Twitter handle gigahertz
just being camp Tommy I'm 5 gigahertz
anyway put my scythe Fuma cooler I don't
we've seen one of those on Hanson a new
sign MSI GTX 970 with the kraken g12 and
Thermaltake hundred and twenty
millimeter all-in-one cooling it which
has also been overclocked to 1562
megahertz max I want terabyte and 4
terabyte hard drives to 120 gig Samsung
840 and 850 Evo SSDs this is Eve 97 hey
our motherboard Thermaltake view 27 case
and does this and air lens what is that
what oh technology air lens fit Phoenix
extensions absent what's an air lens I
am not sure what that is all right is
that the fan grill maybe I don't know
that's the only thing in the system that
I'm like I know what that is not really
sure alright thank you for the reverse
shot of the cable management it's not
it's not pretty yeah I mean it's pretty
standard as far as cable management
behind the motherboard tray goes but
thank you for including that nonetheless
alright I'm gonna say I can't I can't
view this this image by itself
all right so we have we have like a
twisty like a whirlwind
because cyclones like yes it's like
cyclone design for this for the
motherboard power cables and the video
card your thought I kinda like I don't
know it's just it's different I feel
like the concept is good it's a little
haphazard execution could be improved
but I think the concept is good like you
could make that look a lot better I
think like you could take it a step
further I think in its current state it
for me personally leaves a little bit
less desired but I think it could be
really a nice sort of like Paul said
something more unique and more
personalized for your build if you could
do it with a little bit more finesse
yeah I think it's gonna be so cool
beyond that yeah so maybe maybe give it
a second attempt at swirling those
around you can it could be a little bit
smoother but like the the whatever this
I think you weight is in an SLI setup
with it
maybe that's data to graphics currents
it looks like there's two graphics cards
what's the lower weight one two graphics
cards
oh you mean two slots populated it's a
970 under the crack in G 12 which is the
upper thing with the NZXT logo on it
what's the what's the lower thing there
that's probably just like a maybe Nick
corridor but it has but it has our cable
go you're right oh that is a GPU it's it
looks like that an EVGA GTX 660 or
something had it had that middle I don't
know anyway evening GAA made a bunch of
cards with the middle connector too so
what I was about to say though is that
aesthetically everything here I mean
assuming that the you clean up your
swirly job on the cables there
everything here looks so clean and well
matched even the chrome on the cooler
except that single knock to a fan like I
haven't I've never seen a more out of
place looking not to a fan right cuz
there's only one compared to everything
else yeah so just like I mean
again we always hate to say give them
away we get rid of a knot using a fan
mean not to but you can sell that for a
decent amount and just swap it for one
of their industrial models that's that's
sort of that the gray color and they'll
match and you'll be they'll be all set
yeah okay thank you Nick though for
sending that in Thank You Nick next is
the prophecy
thank you promised this long we've known
the purposes for what indeed he often
helps others so he cases into Rozell
fractal design define s and upgraded his
GPU to AP NY USA gtx 1070 last week let
me know what you think so this is
actually not prophesies build but one
that he helped out a friend with and
first colony on the cable management
very clean very cleanly on the business
end of things mhm yeah it looks like if
you've ever had to remove a component or
something like that very easy to get in
there and remove the cabling looking at
the pretty side if you will
very clean cable management on this side
as well everything is ready to its
proper grommet or cut out of course
we're deal with ketchup and mustard
aesthetically obviously that's that's
not the prettiest but what can you do
other than getting a brand new power
supply and redoing all that I have
to say these are the nicest looking
ketchup and mustard cables I've ever
seen yeah like they're super net like
that's the cleanest routing of crappy
cables exactly I feel like right you
know it's like a homeless guy walking
into like a ballroom dance and just like
owning it I don't want any change to the
physical layout of the all-in-one here
but I do I want something done about the
top of it either just paint it black
over the top yeah or stick a sticker on
there or something right
I'm clean things up upside down words
and lettering Oh uses distract and then
here this is a again thank you for the
the reverse shot of the cable management
this is not a critique it's a a theory
question for you guys out there whenever
I'm routing cables and I have extra
cables and you know you got a bunch him
up or whatever and try to get him out of
the way I'm always just ever so slightly
paranoid about putting them right behind
in the motherboard trip I mean where the
motherboard is exposed it I think it's
purely just me being paranoid and
there's no actual danger anything there
I don't think there's anything at all
wrong with what you've done here but the
thought comes to mind so I thought I'd
say it so there you go yeah that'd be an
interesting sort of test I'd like to see
someone investigate that further oh it's
a 3930k not overclocked x79 motherboard
16 gigs it's a XM of course they're XMS
through memory PNY gtx 1070 t.i and a
samsung 850 Evo 2 2 terabyte hard drives
and the fractal define s I wonder what
the rationale is behind putting the GPU
in the X 8 slot and not the x16 slot
like there's any clearance issues unless
you just wanted like better access to
your say that ports or something that
are not I mean practically speaking
there's not really family performance
there's no yeah there's no it's not
gonna affect your frame rate I just I'm
just curious
typically benchmarks that I see
comparing that top slot to the to a
secondary he's like no second or third
shot like it's it it's usually a
measurable slight dip in performance but
it's like you know a percentage point
yeah that's like a one to two persons
like a tenth or a hundredth of a
percentage point difference so yeah
nothing at all to be concerned about
anyway Provost thank you for sending
that in thanks man great job on that
build we got Bassel or basil I'm not
sure exactly how to pronounce your name
sorry basil Mahmud I'm gonna say battle
with an 8700 k overclocked to 5
gigahertz hey but the help of cracked in
X 52 on top of a as rock or I'm sorry
asus rog maximus 10 hero you've also got
an rog Strix 1080 ti-ti ti-ti was very
nice 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance
Argentine memory and elgato hd60 Pro
this is obviously a gaming and streaming
system or at least a capture system one
terabyte samsung 960 Evo and dot 2 SSD a
2 terabyte Seagate Barracuda pro hard
drive see sonic 800 watt prime platinum
PSU and a fan text into evolve case I'm
there every week a fee system hardware
wise this thing can pretty much handle
anything you toss at it so props on that
hmm I gotta get all right I want to give
a shout out to the power supply we have
it we have an 80 plus titanium rated
power supply from Seagate's and it's
Citygate makes power supply I'm sorry
see sonic I read see sonic and see Gator
they're right next to each other and
they both sever see and I've been
drinking no no let's start with s now
they both start with s da that's letters
even the letter
Sonic
even the letter is like what Sonic good
see that's that see Sonic
Seagate okay you're trying to make me
feel like I'm screwing up way more than
I actually a.m.
it's not gonna work Kyle it's not gonna
work acting it already has
okay so all right the first thing that
stands out to me is the mismatch in the
blue color on the accents and the
corners the fans as well as the cable
extensions I'm sad that that's your
accent color and it just doesn't match
I'm not sure what you can do about that
I would say I would sacrifice your your
corner accents on the fans before
sacrificing your cable extensions so
maybe I are those swappable on those
course your fans can you yes yes so
maybe maybe just swap those with gray or
black or white or something more neutral
because well because I appreciate the
blue black gray thing but it's yeah it's
just it's too it's it's more of a royal
blue I feel like right royal yeah royal
versus sort of just regular blue or a
lighter blue also everything yes what
Paul said for the other guys built
earlier applies to this as well your top
theorem heatsink is kind of being masked
out by the cables cutting off your water
block on the AI oh so maybe the crack in
those around the Krakens a bitch it's
got it's got tons is like it's coming
separate sets of cables oh yeah
absolutely though but if there's any
possible way I've dealt with this myself
personally dozens of times there is a
way to route them around it's kind of a
pain but you can do it and that board is
so nice looking you go show it off in
its entirety yeah I feel that
I appreciate that we have some cable
training going on here but I feel like
especially if those if those cable
training clips have been been in place
for a while maybe see if you can remove
them they don't look like the kind
completely covering all the cables and
mm-hmm I don't know there's there's just
this is this is the tiniest of critiques
so completely ignore it if you want to
but they're not straight there they're
ever so slightly up
yeah it's that uncanny valley I feel
like that I'm right and that I'm hitting
there that's just bothering me a little
bit the 24 pin looks great though so so
that saw it I also like the I like the
level of droop äj-- you have and your
your tube your tubing for your NZXT
Kraken X this is X 52 but I think he
managed to get his GPU not to sag oh
yeah zero Drupa that's pretty rigid I
like those strict cards are you known
for drooping in my experience good on
you for that I would I would honestly I
would look into maybe some cable mod Pro
Series cables it looks like you have
there it looks those look like regular
cable mod extensions that's just what
they look like but that's why they
invented or that's why they created the
pros by the way the Pro Series because
they look a lot nicer
this is customized this also might be
the first time on pin my PC that we said
you have cable extensions you need to
upgrade your cable extensions I think
that's a valid statement I don't you
know sometimes so not all extensions are
movable we're all about the aesthetics
I'm put my PCs are all right thank you
that's what makes it pimp Thank You
basil thanks for your submission and
finally next is Nino julik you know
finding me no okay
core i7 4770k 4.6 gigahertz deal it in
very nice but the night chill x4 nvidia
geforce gtx 1070 you don't see too many
I chill graphics cards these no that's a
refreshing knock to an HD 15 classic
he's in Croatia that's why Croatia it
all makes it before an eye chill doesn't
distribute to the US as far as I know
true and then 16 gigs of ddr3 fractal
design defined s with 6gp 14 so he
actually upgrade all the fans very nice
I like that fractal Josh thanks you yes
and Corsair RM 550 with a bunch of good
Seagate and samsung drives cool let's
see here oh I wonder if that little mini
fan came standard on that card yeah it's
part of it uh-huh that's cool I wonder
if it's noisy I won't like my lamps up
when I don't I don't know I've never
really touched any of those 10
millimeter right so we've the obvious
first thing is the Noctua fans that
stand out and the constant battle of yes
they're awesome so don't remove them for
anything other than replacing them with
Noctua industrial series fans that we
just matched a little bit better but
yeah I believe you can get knocked to an
industrial series hundred and forty moon
at 140 millimeter fans
I believe that go on that mm-hmm right
it's an 1815
that would look a bit better swap those
out beyond that your cable management is
pretty clean overall yeah the bottom
Finn's got a cable that's kind of
hanging out there route route that cable
in through the power supply Grumman yeah
so sure that's a little lazy there that
could be rerouted and then beyond that
you know some cool cable extensions
would would top things off but but you
don't necessarily have bad looking
cables they're all black so yeah so yeah
that really solid build though overall I
bet that I bet this thing is pretty fast
screams like a champ all right thank you
very much Nina all right that's all that
will conclude it for Pitt my PC and
gracias to everyone who submitted yeah
and get pics don't get too discouraged
I'll be doing this again will be doing
this again many many times so moving on
to some tech news how about both let's
talk about some elite benchmarks if you
will
starting with this article from WCC of
tech talking about some dude who
revealed 2700 X benchmarks and over
 results ahead of lunch since I
got course the rise in 720 700 X whoo
all right people just can't keep their
mouth shut before so our goal is so
sketchy that's what this this extra tape
I was wondering that too like did the
guy try to reseal it in a most Otto
convincing way I were it kind of looks
like he was trying to cover up
potentially some identifying information
from the box maybe is there really
oh because they could AMD could maybe
track that and find out where it was
bought from I mean if there was a serial
number directly then maybe yeah yeah at
any rate um it does look fairly
convincing and especially because I
think the cooler is more convincing than
the label feel like the cooler can be
copied quite as easily that is the new
wraith prism which AMD has shown off in
the past but it's got a new RGB fan that
also falls victim to our clear heels
syndrome that we talked about on pip my
pc often so it's got a clear RGB fan now
but the RGB on these blades should be a
lot more luminescent than the simple
ring that was around the wraith max as
we saw in the last generation of rays
and chips so if you're into that cool
and of course you don't have to end they
bled out you can just leave it unplugged
the LED unplugged but I think what's
most interesting here is that we finally
get a glimpse at the overclocking
potential of second generation with this
chip the chip is apparently running
three to four hundred megahertz higher
than the first generation so we actually
saw this guy saw 4.3 gigahertz overclock
but the corsair h 90 which is a 120
millimeter radiator AIO so that's pretty
good isn't it so not nice not
necessarily like this man's right cooler
right so you still liquid so you get
spend maybe 50 bucks on a liquid cooler
and still get a 4.3 gigahertz overclock
that's pretty solid in my opinion and
just to reiterate
take this all with a grain of salt
because this is
from like a fully trusted source or
anything but as far as testing hardware
goes it was overclocked with a gigabyte
a X 370 bear in mind and remember that
the second gen rising chips are gonna be
able to operate properly on X 370
motherboards so that's nice backwards
compatibility
and 36 hundred megahertz ddr4 kit we
don't know exactly which kit but the
fact that it was able to run at 30 600
megahertz without problems is also great
news because as we all know risin and
the exam architecture heavily relies on
memory frequency when it comes to things
like gaming performance in terms of
frame rates and whatnot do the Infinity
fabric that's interwoven into the
architecture itself so being able to hit
3600 stabili oh is a really great news
for gamers it also scored a 1946
Cinebench run which pretty much rivals
an i7 78 20x that's pretty cool
22,000 what I said hey hey with two eyes
yeah
22,000 226 points in 3d mark firestrike
which is shockingly close to thread
Ripper 1920 X scores which had just
under 23 thousand points so looking good
so far I hope this is real because
because because it it's the additive
effects of increased frequency with core
counts because if you take say a quad
core and increase the frequency like
Intel did for five years when they had
no competition from AMD you get better
performance can like percentage-wise
yeah it's scales right up
but you jump to 6 cores and eight cores
and add the simultaneous multi-threading
and then also increase the frequency
you're going to get the performance
ramps up more quickly right it's nice
this is true
and the only other note here is that I
would say for proper testing what you
would probably see from most reviewers
come launch day with a proper review
from folks like myself and Paul is that
will probably be testing it with an X
470 board and the main difference I want
to point out here is that X is far 2.0
requires X 470 to work which means that
right out of the box you'll actually be
running slightly slower on X 370 board
then an X 470 board unless you're
overclocking so something to bear in
mind but cool stuff
thank you very much WCC of text of that
article moving on here Apple I'm sure
you guys saw this all over the place I
saw in a pretty much every website it
visited this morning
Apple is planning to use their own
in-house CPUs replacing Intel's
for several reasons this is of course a
rumor at the moment this is an article
from hexxus so thanks thanks to them
this is basically taken from inside
sources that were talking to Bloomberg
earlier this week apples sort of
gradually moving away from using these
Intel chips which they've been using for
years and years in place of their own
the CPU plans themselves are codenamed
kalamata it's a pretty badass column
kalamata which you know is in the early
stages of development at the moment of
course again this is all rumors and
stuff these squiggly lines on this chart
read the squiggly lines mine the
squiggly lines and figure out what they
mean and then tell me and Paul got this
blue one sucks yeah so don't be the
light blue ones that one here that one
he's a shithead and then having the
first machines the first machines that
will be using these in-house apple chips
could be here as early as 2020 which
sounds like really far away but it's
actually really close I think time is
moving too fast and scary this is likely
to take the form of laptops at first in
like seven years you know 20 20 20 is
like in a year and a half year in almost
a year and a half to two years
we're in 2018 now Paul
Paul are you are you okay
because I sleep for that for that long
you you might have been he might have
been I should have woke you up I wasn't
I wasn't thinking clearly I I'm sorry to
be the one to break this news to you but
it's it's 2018 you've been you've been
asleep for five years like I'm in a nice
nice chamber it's like I'm in the future
then the future so this is crazy
great the reason why Apple would do
something like this it actually makes a
lot of sense in their defense is that it
gives them more control over the
architecture itself so that they can
optimize that architecture to work
properly and more efficiently with their
hardware Apple has always been the type
of company I think to want to do
everything themselves I feel like it's
like I would be like I'm like the Apple
version of a YouTube channel like I I
freaked out when I think about like
hiring like a giant 20 man team like
Linus has nothing against that doesn't
it just doesn't work for me in my brain
I want to be able to control everything
myself and I feel like that's sort of
what the approach that Apple is taking
here is that by having their own
architecture having their own CPUs they
can control the pricing obviously of
their products and they don't have to
rely airily on another company's release
cycle like Intel has a very set product
cycle you know where that Apple has to
sort of adhere to to some degree and so
they want full rein I will say this in
all seriousness when it comes to Apple
developing its own hardware and the
scares that have come out recently when
it comes to stuff like Spectre and milk
meltdown and vulnerability at the
hardware level mm-hmm when it comes to
security yeah let's do the you know
built-in backdoors that kind of thing at
all of all companies I would expect to
actually develop hardware that was free
of that kind of thing based on yeah how
Apple has responded to not not that
they've been hundred percent like
right all the time but how they've
responded to inquiries of you know
pulling information from locked cell
phones that can I think anyway right
okay you know that's true that's a good
point someone brings up in chatez could
this be the end of hakkon Tosh's right
if if if you know the cpu is completely
out of intel's hands and people can't
find a way around that and Apple can
make it foolproof to ensure that no
foreign operating system runs on their
hardware that's a very good point that
community might be affected in some way
who knows but let's see this isn't super
out of character of Apple I mean last
year they ended their partnership with
imagination tech or imagination tech for
its mobile device mobile device GPUs in
order to implement a separate
independent graphics design in order to
control its products with Apple it's all
about control anything that will you
know allow them to control their
hardware their ecosystem and their
consumers is the direction they usually
head and that's been working out I guess
probably well for them they've already
put their first in-house GPU inside of
the iPhone X you could and the iPhone 8
and and how does this affect in tow I
mean the news that Apple which is one of
the largest companies in the world is
dropping another major tech giant Intel
how does that affect Intel I mean the
news dropped what a day or two ago and
already since then Intel shears have
dropped as much as 9.2 percent they did
recover slightly closing at night 6.4
percent down is the hostage is the humm
better it is for me I switched the fan
from two to one it's actually quite
powerful I think I think if you took if
you tweeted a picture of how large the
fan is people would laugh based on the
hum that it was producing normal it's
it's like literally like this big it's a
tiny fan you guys are probably imagining
like a giant box blower industrial fan
it's like a a team in razor-sharp blades
and with no with no grill
blood-splattered decapitated body parts
all around it the dogs are going on in
the daytime and pissing on at night okay
we were talking about tech news Paul yes
following up with with the article we
just talked about what about what about
steam machines this is more other word
more that there was more than one
article on that what I forgot to show
this one I only linked one oh no I
opened the Bloomberg article and there
was this dude anyway I never meant no I
wanted to talk about some steam issues
new machines are terrible yeah they're
so terrible that's that valve themselves
what a lot of obviously the one of the
parties involved here has removed all
steam machines from their hardware drop
down menu on the main steam store page
this happened around March 20th that a
week or two ago and a lot of people are
saying this is the final nail in the
coffin for these steam machines which
was valves initiative to work with
third-party PC makers some PC
manufacturers to create these little
steam OS based systems that could run
steam up the steam operating system
which was a Linux based operating system
and had its own little contained
ecosystem it was supposed to be a huge
thing Gabe Newell praised his name did
did mention he did voice his concerns
about this being a giant failure and of
course he was right because he is God
and mid-2016 mid-20 note that's
mid-2016 it was reported less than
500,000 units sold of these steam
machines over a seven month period
barely making a dent in the PC gaming
market and I don't know a single person
that actually spent their own money on
the steam machine
that's what I mean when these came out I
was like cool idea and then I actually
used one and I was like the steel OS is
very underwhelming because it really
just did it was really just a window
into steam and using the steam in her
face and it was like okay it was
basically steam big picture mode in my
eyes but there what it didn't feel like
a full-blown PC and it just goes to show
that the PC community values their
freedom and the ability to do whatever
the hell they want on their systems on
their PCs so much to the point where
even a giant big player a big proponent
of PC gaming like valve couldn't sway
them from that school of thought
thank you where they was jet able to
hear your voice no or did you mute the
entire line I just see it's just silent
Pawlik and then this is your volume back
up just know it weren't working it
worked
there thankfully I am amazed I'm kind of
every time that happens while we're
live-streaming like I know I can stop it
but if I yell at them right then a rip
headphone you suddenly that I had this
brainwave oh yeah I can control the
volume wow that was really impressive
thank you you showed those dogs that
show who's boss um so yeah I mean steam
machines they just suck you know when
it's face steamos um like I don't know I
I never paid that close of attention to
them so I guess maybe that's I don't
know but it seemed like the type of
thing when they were coming out that I
thought like oh yeah these will easily
pick up some steam but just yeah I mean
if people want a gaming PC but they
don't want to pay the extra amount of
money they have to pay for something
like Windows and you just get this in
place team games yeah to be fair the
steam machines have sort of aided in the
more widespread adoption of gaming on
Linux because steam OS is Linux based so
I think currently there are like over
4,000 titles that are supported on Linux
that just a couple of years ago before
the steam machines launched it was it
was there was a dearth of Linux
supported games so in that sense the
operating system itself has kind of
encouraged a more mainstream adoption
I think of Linux gaming but the hardware
itself apparently even according to
valve is a flop
as they've removed it completely from
their front page and whatnot but so rip
you know steam machines when did they
start two years ago 2016 no before that
new egg Oh 20 Greg wouldn't listen been
like 2014 2013 I was back in 1982 no
[Laughter]
loser I get like the more time just goes
up and windows I'm like that could
be true wait I gotta verify this like I
can't just immediately write it off like
no maybe it was that year I can't even
tell anymore
this next story before it okay lose my
mind thank you video cards for this
article in the curtain MSI X 470
motherboard being leaked this is an in
particular the gaming Pro carbon a/c
available in two variants one with Wi-Fi
presumably AC Wi-Fi and one without
which I would assume the non Wi-Fi
motherboard would not have the AC
moniker or the end tag on the end of its
model name if you want to compare this
to the X 370 model because there was a
gaming pro a giving Pro carbon X 370
here are the differences the X 470 model
has real heat sinks over the BRM so it
actually has like a genuine fin stack
instead of just like a vanity heatsink
richland the X 470 has like a vanity
heats I'm sorry X 370 has a vanity
heatsink X 470 has this is X 370 on the
left yes heatsink on the BRM
this is the Z 370 so actually an Intel
motherboard and the right
well it yes video cards has included
pictures of the 470 board here and here
and then at the bottom o comparison they
included a picture of the X 370 X week
seventies last reservation and the Z 370
just to compare because then this is big
leads this has been a critique leveled
at Mandi has kind of made its resurgence
over the past year year and a half a
critique against motherboard
manufacturers has been that the AMD
boards aren't built to the same level of
quality as of the Intel boards so I
think that's perhaps one of the things
they're pointing out here is the lack of
quality of the original X 370 board
versus the Z 370 board and the rights
and then compare that to the updated one
which looks more like the Intel one
right so it looks like they're given it
the same or at least close at the same
level or maybe maybe I'm just making
this stuff up in my head right I don't
remember reading anything about the
inequality thing so I should mention it
does make sense actually no but now that
I compare them it doesn't look that
different everything I just said was
 I take it all back Paul's
conspiracies looks like the same number
of faces for power delivery should make
that one is one of the segments on your
half of the show is like Paul's
conspiracy theories where you just you
just put you theorize about trends in
the PC market that may or may not exist
I see the same number of chokes on the
left side there it is all right equal
number of chokes I have already think is
good in a universe I'm straight here ok
but this isn't even ok other things that
are different from the x2 b70 compared
to the X 470 model is that the X 470
board now has two 8-pin EPS connectors
for additional power delivery where I
see seven you only had one so that's
nice mortality for all that it's now
getting somewhere there it is thank you
eight pen
yeah to 8-pin the x-47b board also loses
a PCI Express by one slot but it gains
two additional SATA ports I don't know
if that's a fair trade or not I guess it
depends who you ask
so in total you get either Satyam you
don't get the upper most along in the
uppermost one I would imagine most
people don't use it to get more SATA
connected I think I don't see it as nice
there for sure and then you have a new
longer version of the M to shield on one
of the two M got two slots which you
know will actually for gamers nexuses
regrets what I've been waiting for make
it longer you know the X 370 has like
this m dot to shield that's really just
super not doing it for Manny
I need more length and my end that to
shield I don't really think it's a
shield look at the full coverage you get
here I'm not - doesn't need a shield
just I'm not - manufacturers need to
just make good looking I'm about two
drives I'm gonna need a shield it's like
here they're not meant to get they're
not meant to be here you hear your
flaccid just put air flow I would like
to hear your fully erect that's the
comparison that's hashtag marketing
right there is that um now rest assured
this is not the flagship MSI board there
will be a gaming m7 which will
reportedly have a higher-end
sort of look and layout than this board
as this one is missing certain features
that you might expect from a high-end
board like a debug leb or
surface-mounted power and reset which
I'm sure the gaming m7 will certainly
have actually yeah that's that's BS as
BS I really do like all three of those
things
there's not a shot of the i/o here
either you know I can't see if there's
an external clear CMOS that would be
that would be something I'd look for as
well indeed moving on though okay um
keep an eye out for that board we have
an article from the verge here about a
new version of Firefox built for virtual
reality and augmented reality for that
matter they announced their Firefox
reality for standalone for an augmented
reality headsets it's gonna be
cross-platform open-source
and privacy friendly and it's gonna be
mainly targeted for those who will want
to interface with headsets this is for
people with headsets in mind this is
what this browser is designed for and
I'm confused it's it's a it's a VR
browsing experience have you ever wanted
to browse Google Chrome or any other
browser in dr paul no see your articles
read your articles in virtual reality
yes no right no well like if you've used
the you've used the vibe right you can
go in there and there's a control panel
and you can pull up a thing and you can
view any website so what's what's
different this is different because
reasons I don't really know the article
was very the article was very brief and
vague in terms of would you say makes
this different then it wasn't quite
doing what you were doing wasn't quite
thorough
it was maybe like on the verge of being
thorough is that are you gonna be funny
right now
so I don't know I really don't know what
is different here I think maybe the fact
that it's open source means that people
will be able to tap into this version of
the browser and and maybe create
experiences that are more tailored for a
VR environment do you mean okay um
Firefox developers out there cuz I know
there's a lot of you who watch our live
show what I've been looking for here
right is you're in VR you got your
headset on you're in that environment
and what that's already taken care of
sir Ector it's what I'm looking for is
like the experience that that I keep
seeing in
Minority Report like ready player one
I feel like had a little zit it's like
you've got a heads-up display that pops
up in front of you it's curved around
your eyes and you can just like reach up
it looks like this rain yeah things
right that'd be nice make websites into
that yeah so that you pull up a website
and then you can do it this is a bunch
of glass windows like semi opaque okay
windows you can even poke at it our head
and swipe things away that's the key
thing you need to be able to have this
sort of this feeling and look of disdain
like that and just like you know
swipe it away and then you're gonna feel
like magneto just being able to like
move with your mind answer this
ethereal semi opaque image that appears
and you guys know I'm tired that sounds
sexy
okay that's not successful um no this
isn't gonna be a device specific browser
which i think is a good thing because if
you think about it
Firefox is kind of cool in the sense
where they don't have a headset of their
own and so it makes them very Hardware
agnostic I agree if you will whereas
Google is sort of working on an
experimental version of Chrome that
works only with daydream and then you've
got Microsoft edge for whoever uses that
working on augmented reality for
Microsoft based headsets sure
DT sounds good and then you've also got
the the woman oculus released from the
gear VR which is you know specific to
that so Firefox is going to be more open
source it's gonna be cross-platform and
all that jazz so that's nice they did
release a demo that's not released
publicly yet does show it a very
traditional looking browser floating in
space as we've seen with a lot of VR
browsing experiences so far the article
says that yes
doesn't bother to show it though doesn't
show it's not publicly released yet Paul
said that I don't know why I don't know
why I don't know why they wouldn't just
like what why are they why are they
hiding well they were about to they were
they were on the verge of spill the
beans enough enough
you're done I get I would get fired from
the verge so quickly you just imagine
like a meeting we're like the imported
like one of the directors like alright
what kind of work tools do we have well
I was on the verrat Paul's like I was at
the verge of getting this really great
Sir Paul get the out get the
out food get out of my office right now
Paul I'm sick of your goddamn every
goddamn day you're making some verge a
spawn no one gives us Paul would be
fine I won't do that now
ok it was a good pop that was satisfying
popular like it's hot
switching to some delirium tremens now
because that sounded like a good idea
DT baby alright alright what's next
let's move on to the next article here
bees yes but seems like the little
insects these are important are now
wearing QR codes good let's go that'll
get it's about the bee or the QR code
yeah that cute it's about timing they
they got what The Times you stamped cat
on lion it's it's Merck it's the mark of
the beast
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
Pixar when it's okay come up with in the
next V movie alright this Argos from
wired thinks wired this is the B tag
system
so by audit but by basically putting QR
codes on B's and the QR code thing is
the only thing that's technical about
this article everything else has to do
with like environmental responsibility
with bees and but the QR code
system here allows scientists and
researchers to automatically monitor
hundreds of bees whether the use of a
camera a camera just scans all the QR
codes on the individual bees you can see
here though you can actually see like
individual they'll have they'll have a
designated number so they can be tracked
it tracks their behavior how they
interact with other bees and why would
they do this the reason here the
reasoning here the point of it all
there's a couple of reasons for one they
want to see how bees no because in be
society in a bee colony you have two
types of bees you have the workers who
stay in the hive and just work in the
hive and then you have the foragers who
go out in the open the wild and they
pollinate and they bring back food
to the hive so you have the foragers and
the workers and what happens in the bee
colony is when the forager let's say a
forager bee dies they've either get
snatched up by a scientist or it gets
eaten by another bug or whatever if a
forager dies the worker bee one of the
worker bees it has a correspondent
worker bee that automatically knows to
take over the foragers job and so it
sort of like promotes itself and it goes
alright I'm doing a title change here I
know that my buddy has died and I'm
gonna stop being a worker and I'm gonna
become a forager to fill his place
essentially pick up the slack of food
production on so scientists are thinking
here and they've already done enough
research to know that there's no
explicit commands that these bees are
receiving so how the hell do they know
when they need to pick up the slack of a
fallen forward
be and the QR code system here has
allowed them to see that bees actually
stick to one area of the hive the worker
bees some of them only stick around the
outskirts of it and others are right at
the food source and they only hang out
around the food source or the food
storage area known as the honeypot and
so essentially what they're figuring out
is like the honeypot is that if enough
forager bees die then this the food
storage area starts to look a little bit
low and so the the worker bees who are
working that area kind of see and go oh
 we're looking a little low I think
a couple of my buddies must have just
fallen off so you know what I'm gonna
pick up the slack I'm gonna go out I'm
gonna start foraging and the analogy
they given the article which I thought
was a really good analogy it was kind of
like when you go to the fridge and you
notice like you're on the last sip of
milk you're just kind of like skimming
the milk you're gonna be the one to go
out and buy more milk like how do they
know it's because he's around that area
at the time and so that's what that's
one of the reasons why they're doing
this QR code system the other reason is
to investigate how certain pesticides
affect behavior nah hey that one was
pre-med that so that one was
premeditated I thought about that
earlier it was written down right here
yeah so it couldn't afford you anyway
but um so so so that make sense - I mean
pesticides scientists are constantly
researching on which pesticides kill the
least amount of bees but also are the
most effective at doing their job that's
obviously very important because you
have yes forager bee and the worker bee
you know one who takes over the job at
the other I want the pesticides you
could have the situation where you've
got those two bees and you may be in
like you know the two bees or not
ah yeah this is this is exactly what I
was hoping this article would turn into
it's just a bunch of all my deepest
wishes came true
I could not be happier though I can
we're overjoyed we can keep it going I'm
sure we can give me like five minutes I
can come up with another one it could be
here oh okay all right so so I mean
you know just because a pesticide isn't
killing off a beat colony or population
doesn't mean it's not changing their
behavior there could be a pesticide that
just causes half a colony of bees to go
crazy and researchers and scientists
wouldn't really know the effects of a
pesticide unless they had this sort of
QR code technology to be able to track
the independent movements of each of
these bees so altogether that's a lot of
 information about bees for today
I'm gonna move on to the next segment
but I think it's kind of cool Elsa kinda
seems like ehb has like a gang sign
right right ass can edit brushes
and they'll say you know this this this
bees gang is five zero eight three five
five zero five eight three bi wait 3x3
crew bro so cool and let's talk about
our final tech story for today which is
also from the verge we're rich puns
coming Tesla
missing the mark on there two and a half
thousand Model 3 a week goal they were
Tesla was like okay
Elon Musk is notorious and he's infamous
for setting these ridiculous goals which
you know ambitious and and admirable as
they are and then not meeting them okay
and that's not to say that he hasn't
done some amazing things in the last
decade or so but when it comes to the
model 3 production Tesla as a company
has been a little slow and they've
fallen short of their 2,500 model
three's a week goal at the end of this
first financial quarter 2018 it's gonna
start the second quarter which is now
making just 2000 model threes per week
but it says it can get to 5,000 model
threes a week by mid 2018 and and the
biggest bottleneck here
as to why Tesla hasn't been able to meet
the demand or their set goals for
producing this mini model three's a week
is because they have some supply chain
shortages and some some factory issues
creating the batteries that are going
into these cars so they actually had to
stop production for I don't know how
long but they have to stop production
completely in order to replace or renew
or revise some of the hardware and some
of the factory equipment that was in
their massive Giga factory in order to
get back up to speed that's the same
battery that goes in the power wall that
that would be badass
but these targets that would be that is
that's that is that is badass is the
fact of how it exists wait you're you're
bullshitting right no really that's the
same batteries like in terms according
to what the Tesla dudes told me
yesterday yes really yeah that's
actually pretty badass that's super cool
and you guys should stay tuned on Paul's
channel because their manes getting a
 power wall built into his house
they're manufactured at the Giga Factory
at Tesla's Giga factory which they're
expanding
yes increase the production but yeah and
you'll be vlogging about your own
experience with the power wall right
yeah I got I got the power that you're
seeing right now all the electrons here
that are all being passed through a new
main panel unit that was installed
yesterday I saw it it looks very nice
reparation for the power wall and solar
that's gonna go in later next week I
can't yeah I'll do videos and everything
too
so Tesla was supposed to make about
30,000 Model threes in this quarter they
only made about 10,000 so they're about
you know they've fallen pretty short
especially when you consider the
pre-order list for the Model 3 includes
five excuse me five hundred thousand
customers but only ten thousand have
been served so to speak a sizable chunk
of these model threes actually came were
actually built in the final week of the
first quarter to meet Elon Musk's target
that's also because Elon Musk personally
took charge of model three production in
the last week of the quarter like he was
in there you bending metal into the
place
yes physically building the cars himself
he's like a blacksmith you know just
ordering around everyone he like the
master blacks riding on a treadmill
really really fast to charge the
batteries and you know as soon almost
five thousand a week which I mean to
some degree like Elon Musk factor has
its perks
I mean it's effective to some degree
because as soon as Elon Musk stepped in
Elon Musk stepped in they ramped up to
about 2000 model threes in the last week
which compared to the other weeks I mean
they were doing probably like six seven
hundred so just Elon Musk being there
and just like you know waving his dick
around in the warehouse or whatever got
people off their asses like we got
to make some model threes it's kind of
funny because employees who are working
on other Tesla vehicles like the Model X
and the Model S they were actually
advised and asked to shift their focus
into making more model threes to meet
demand and stuff with an internal memo
that said we need all of you to stop
what you're doing work on model three
production so that we can quote prove a
bunch of haters wrong because there's a
lot of skepticism yeah as to whether or
not Tesla and Elon Musk could produce
this many model threes in such a short
time the haters right so that's kind of
funny I'm sure that was sent from Yulin
himself or at least someone very close
to him in the company musk personally
took over a model 3 production not just
in the first week or the last week of
the first quarter but the board and
shareholders of Tesla actually recently
approved a 2.6 billion dollar
compensation plan to keep Elon Musk in
charge for the next decade
and these payouts these crazy
astronomically ludicrously rich payouts
are basically gonna come out whether or
not the company hits their milestones so
even if Elon Musk makes one model 3 in
the next 10 years a decade you know he's
still gonna get 2.6 billion dollars is
that I don't know if I'm reading that
right that's what it sounds like freakin
insane damn on the haters that's all I
got for now guys
holy smokes let's let's do some
donations damn starting with starting
with Scott building yes
we're gonna blaze through these guys
because we have a lot more to cover in
Paul's half Scott I'll make six dollars
and 66 cents Cheers
cheers to you sir thank you very much
jet adventure media $5.00 can we get the
are IP or rip gamepad design on a
mousepad I will definitely look into
that for you sir that idea
bazinga ex $20 love Paul skincare on
April Fool's though thank you some video
miss dears Kyle I didn't have one so
that's why you missed it $100 to both
next week if Kyle let's Paul make him up
as Paul made himself must be done at the
start of the show and where during
entire store this is like a ransom note
cheese it seems like look at the demands
there is two dares debate specific
within a time and timing and everything
will have to look at and tell you what
if wifey sauce wants an extra hundo next
week then have her bring her makeup mmm
and I feel much more confident with her
doing anything with makeup and yeah I
mean well I mean she could be there to
advise as I apply it that's true it
could be that could be I mean but also
I've got my own makeup channel now so
yeah I would be really good I mean
you're the expert in office and you saw
how that turned out thank you bazinga
axe thanks bazinga
Philip Rams ten dollars why isn't there
any TV ads by vendors such as MSI
gigabyte Asus is PC building such a
niche market that the cost of
advertising outweighs the chance to nab
a few extra customers yes yeah
absolutely yeah it's too expensive to do
TV way too expensive for how many
motherboards are they really gonna get
bought how many motherboards are people
gonna buy if MSI spends two million
dollars on a Super Bowl ad the the
companies that figure out business
models that make enough money to
advertise on TV or the companies that
build whole computers so you'll see ads
really I mean no not now but are the
dull ads now I know they're know would
be selling their ads in the past but
yeah a certain maybe yeah but whole
companies and that's not to say that
these other companies don't make ads
it's just they don't necessarily pay for
the airtime for building your own
computer is so far away from the average
joe's mind that it's it's not even worth
the advertising for at the moment Thank
You Phil Dez Jones $10 have have chance
to get a Nitro+ Vega 56 limited-edition
for six hundred and ten dollars or a
Nitro+ Vega 64 for $700 thanks to my 100
or gift card for ultra-wide which should
I get
I wanted all AMD built since GPP is
 that's a $90 difference to go
from a Vega 56 to a Vega 64 but
percentage-wise it's not a huge leap
forward I would go for the Vega 64 Yahoo
to and practically speaking this I mean
it's not a practical decision it's just
because if you got the Vega 56 you'd
know that the 64 is there and that you
didn't have the best thing and you're
already spending over $600 so you know
bump it up to 700 yeah - if you're
really all about price to performance
than the Vega 56 is probably a little
bit more reasonable but yeah baby cent
33 $5 is there a way you guys can dupe
it my PC besides Twitter maybe an email
or something I don't do Twitter I'm
sorry if it is sitting Twitter is the
most convenient and effective way for me
to dupe it my PC submissions so maybe
you can just create a fake account and
just you know log on on Tuesdays and
submit your rig honestly it would take
No we fear change we do feel change
creatures of habit
tighten heel bar H with a $20 donation
thank you very much for that I agree
that Steve does have at the care but my
own is just as godly insert yugioh I
challenge you to a duel me that goes
over my head but I'm sure it's hilarious
also I am part of the guys with long
hair demographic lol Cheers
having an arrogant bastard ale those are
my favorite beers in college was
everything bastard I would ride my bike
because I have a car I'd ride to the
nearest liquor store and get a couple 22
bombers of arrogant bastard bring the
back to my dorm and just get super
shit-faced just have immediate sense of
superiority absolutely thank you very
much thank you thank you burn Nikolai
Larsen Oh with the 5 Australia's hello
to see videos coming out of Paul's
hardware again any opinions on the note
202 for an HD PC / living room gaming PC
my opinions are strong on the on the
note - OH - it'll just be held close to
my heart I've used it so many times for
land pcs and even HD pcs at some point
I've recommended it to other people I've
built No - OH - builds for friends and
families family in the past so I think
it's great I think it definitely looks
classy it looks the part it no one would
like look twice at it if someone didn't
know anything about pcs they wouldn't
come into your living room and see you
know - or - and be like is that
thing like it just blends it's good
that's good you've said enough
oh thank do we haven't done any good -
do we have that many things no I don't
like you figure out when you're gonna
wrap things I'm sorry all right Kyle
likes to whack off jizz into the node to
it - it's pretty frequent I won't let
you forget okay I will focus I'll think
something finishing the show it's really
it's a good case a very good choice for
nature so he needs to know I'll stop
there pup Shepherd $5 how's it going
anything new going on just watching
YouTube I hope the people on YouTube HQ
are safe then I did 774 subs today that
was cool
thank you yes questions on that and our
hearts go out to anyone who is involved
in the YouTube headquarters
shooting today that was very unfortunate
news and firmed firmly from the brief
headline I read it sounded like the
shooter was the only one who died so if
that is actually the case then good yeah
all right but thank you pop yen's keep
state strong and best of luck on the
road to a thousand thousand subs
yeah for sure Ezreal Howard as Errol
sorry as they're all Howard for the ten
the Australian apples partners aren't
going to want to rewrite all of their
software for an on x86 architecture no
flipping way they'd sooner rewrite for
Linux on x86 than Mac OS on some custom
instruction chef set this is a response
to or talking about right absolutely in
their own process early and it is part
of a further discussion that we could
have gotten into but we didn't really
round but yet we would agree and yeah if
if they switch to their own CPU
architecture and they're writing their
own software that'll probably all be
part of its own ecosystem right and you
would need some sort of emulation in
middle layer of software in order to run
Apple software on other hardware which
would probably affect performance but
this is all speculative so right thank
you as well and we've definitely some to
consider for sure Sam F $5 Apple will
develop exit babies like CPUs they
aren't just gonna force everybody to
rewrite can recompile code for a holding
architecture that would be absurd again
that's a possibility you know I mean
they it it's it's their decision they
could go the as proprietary as we
possibly can routes where we want to
make everything our own and Apple only
or they could go let's make an x86
compatible so that a lot of existing
software can port over more easily yeah
and they know is they could be
monitoring and data mining like what
applications and programs their users
are using and I could be like you know
what only like 10% of our users are
using x86 applications
we can make way more gains with our own
architecture blah blah you know you know
and not and come out on top so who knows
I guess we'll see but that's a very
interesting thought Adrian dela Cruz ten
bucks
I hope this money buy some liquor I do
hope you can buy some Chi loci rum I
don't know what that is
I just halo Rama it's some kind of rum

that home when we have the fan on or
people only complain about the humming
when we have the fan on um thing this is
the first time we have heard a complaint
about the hum and in quite a while and
yeah we've had the fan on so it could
also be feedback on the electrical
circuit from the fan but I'm not
positive about that okay alright thank
you very much hero is rearranging his
bed and he kicked the camera and moved
it so I'm gonna fix that
Adrian dela Cruz $5 for every beard for

what's a good paper motherboard honestly
I feel like most of the thread Reaper
motherboards are pretty solid with a
with an 80 DT or high-end desktop
platform obviously you can't go wrong
with a Zeus I I'm a huge huge Asus
fanboy to some degree is the zenith
extreme that's worst luck it's very
impractical very impractical is your
super expensive I would just go for the
cheapest try paper motherboard you can
find it still the ass rack I soon a new
90 key is a perfectly adequate solid and
inexpensive but the board they issued
that's just the regular ATX one right
not the micro ATX that exists recently
touch the because I use the x3 99m which
is a micro ATX yeah that's newer okay
yeah and so far that one's been having
no issues and it's been great but it's
microfiber but but the full ATX one has
eight DIMM slots and I would I would
lean towards that with in thread refer
bill just for the like I had what I
would want to eat dim slots
I'd want the ability to upgrade my
memory if I decided I wanted to in the
future and the yeah and then and the
flexibility um okay
thank you very much Andrew tighten heel
bar H once again five bucks that mark of
the beast' comment was hilarious thank
you on an unrelated note have you seen

don't know what I'm saying I don't know
I don't have all the answers Guido I
don't I don't know I can't help you out
through life these important life or
death situations asking so many
questions we got Ganic Guido son of a
bitch Fred Ali readily gamey $5 believe
they're not YouTube ads are more
profitable than Super Bowl ads I
wouldn't doubt it I mean I mean I don't
know I don't know if I'd doubt it
there's no need to set any source on
that yeah we believe you what where's
the we believe you give me that proof
and then the junkman 1991 $20 no comment
