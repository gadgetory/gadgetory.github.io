the drop before it's gone what's up guys
so we have the Craigslist PC here back
in the studio
you guys probably remember me picking
this up from a guy on Craigslist
several months ago hence the name
Craigslist PC I got very creative with
it and it spits back again because I
want to do an upgrade video this is
actually a five year old system or it
was at least five years ago when the
Craigslist dude put it together
initially and that's around the time
when people start looking at serious
upgrades for their rig there's around
the three to five year mark depending of
course give or take everyone's different
depending on your needs and how much
horsepower you're looking for and things
like that what we're gonna be doing
today is I'm gonna give myself a fixed
budget of anywhere between five and six
hundred dollars to spend on upgraded
components that we'll be putting in to
this build and hopefully breathing new
life into this system but let's quickly
recap the specs of this old-timer before
we introduce the new components will be
swapping in starting with the processor
II of the Intel Core i5 35 70 K which is
Ivy Bridge it's a quad core it's got
four threads no hyper threading
it was a great CPU in its day but now
you can find it used on eBay for twenty
to fifty bucks
so its glory days are definitely well
behind it that's being cooled with some
variant of a hyper 212 cooler from
Coolermaster tried-and-true budget
option we also have a z77 motherboard
from MSI the model number of steep
sneezy 77 a g4 one with 16 gigs of ddr3
memory not sure what the speed is we
have three of the same kind of memory
module and then we have one out cache
that's a completely different brand but
16 gigs right there and then our
graphics card is also MSI it's a Radeon
HD 7850 2 big frame buffer was a great
card in its day just like the processor
but now it's definitely starting to show
of age our power supply is a TR - 600
watt unit from thermal tank not sure
exactly how reliable this unit is or if
it's even 80 plus certified it doesn't
look like there's any badge there it
doesn't mean that it's not but I can't
really be sure and then for storage we
have a 120 gig 850 Evo SSD from Samsung
which is what we're booting off of and
this mechanical hard drive which I
cannot see the label from where I'm at
so I don't know that the capacity or
brand but those are the two drives in
the system then of course we have the
case which is the Corsair 200 arc like I
said this is a pretty decent system and
five years ago it was a very capable
machine but alas here in 2018 it's time
for a change so I was looking at this
rig trying to decide what can I keep
what's gonna last me still a few a few
more years and what absolutely needs to
go and the first thing I thought in
terms of upgrades was the CPU so I'm
gonna be swapping out that 35 70 K for
arisin 5 1600 now some of you are
probably like why first gen rising Kyle
you should get the second gen rise and
it's newer it's better and faster yes ok
that's true but the horizon 5 1600 is
still a fantastic 6 core 12 thread chip
it's really not that far behind the 2600
X by any means and you can find it for
20 to 35 dollars cheaper than the 2600 X
depending on where you look so since
we're dealing with the confined budget
I'm going with the 1600 baby and it's
gonna be loads better than 35 70 K in
pretty much every way obviously we can't
pop a risin ship into a z77 board though
that would end poorly for everyone
involved so I'm bringing along the B 350
M Pro vh + motherboard from MSI this is
a very bare-bones motherboard it's
actually one of the cheapest available
on the market with this particular
chipset however it is also kind of -
bare-bones it only has 2 DIMM slots I
would have really opted for the 4 I
think it was an ass rock board that had
4 slots but about the same price the
reason being is because these are all
products that I already had on our shelf
if I actually plan this video ahead of
time like a smart person then that would
have allotted me more time for things
like shipping and be able to whittle
down the price while getting some
components that made a little bit more
sense for this build if you'd like to
see the alternate list of hard
where that I was thinking you can find
the PC part picker list link in the
description below where we actually
brought the total cost of all the
upgraded parts down to about $500 what
you're seeing today right here is closer
to 600 so bear that in mind hope that's
not too confusing obviously we need
memory ddr3 is just not gonna work on
this platform so we have a 16 gigabyte
kit 2 by 8 gig sticks of g.skill ripjaws
5 ddr4 at 2400 speed obviously Rison
would prefer faster memory as always but
again we're on a budget and there's
nothing stopping us really from from
from overclocking this hopefully we
can get 29:33 that would be my goal
anything beyond that would just be the
cherry on top I should also mention that
even though this is a bare-bones
motherboard with only two crappy DIMM
slots it does have an 8 pin EPS
connector on it it is B 350 we can still
overclock our CPU so that's that's nice
at least and then finally our graphics
card will be replacing the Radeon HD
7850 for this lovely EVGA gtx 1050 TI 4
gigabyte models so we're essentially
doubling the frame buffer that's gonna
be fantastic for so many things and this
is just a great card through and through
when it comes to 1080p gaming at high or
even very high settings depending on the
title that you're playing your mileage
may vary 75 watt TDP gets all of its
power straight from the PCIe slot on the
motherboard so that's one less cable
that we have to connect that's that's
actually plugged in right here so
overall this is what our upgrade path
looks like today folks I'm excited to
get things underway you can find links
to all this stuff in the video
description right now I'm gonna start
cutting this guy to make room for all of
this awesome hardware see what I did
there and then we can circle back do a
little happy dance we'll do some AV
comparison testing just to see how much
faster this new and improved rig is
compared to old grandpa here it should
be nothing short of glorious ladies
gentleman about further ado cue montage
all right upgrades complete this is the
finished product it actually looks
really nice it turned out much cleaner
than I thought it would and I guess
that's kudos to the two hundred are for
having some pretty decent cable
management for cheaper case you know
with a plenty of room behind the
motherboard tray and tie-down points and
things like that obviously no power
supply shroud so I did have to stash
some excess cables from our non-causal
nan Bosler non modular power supply in
the hard drive cage you can kind of see
there's looks like the ketchup and
mustard monster took a down there
but it's somewhat out of sight out of
mind for the most part looks very clean
I also relocated the SSD which was
initially in this slot right here and I
didn't like this position because it was
the SSD was facing in such a way where
the ports were right here on the inside
of the case and you could clearly see
the SATA cable the nasty ketchup and
mustard SATA cable going to it so I
repositioned that behind the motherboard
tray it's kind of just floatin there but
not really because it sits tight and
snug so it's not moving around no cables
will come and plugged or anything so I
just put it back there because it looks
cleaner when you can't see it everything
else was pretty straightforward there's
got too much to comment on it was a
really easy going little upgrade so I
think now we're ready for benchmarks and
I'm actually using the same data that
was pulled from the original Craigslist
PC when I tested it initially two months
ago or something like that
I didn't rerun any tests on that I'm
just using the same data there so that's
gonna be compared to the data that I
pulled today using this new and improved
PC just so that we're all on the same
page there if you guys recall I did not
overclock the original Craigslist PC
when I tested it and I tried to do that
same thing with this rig but I couldn't
help myself I over clocked the memory
just a little bit simply because the
Rison platform is so dependent on memory
speeds whereas the Intel platform is
certainly not when it comes to gaming
anyway so I just couldn't help myself I
took it from 2400 to 2933 which isn't
even a huge bump but I think it's gonna
make a few percentage points a
difference at the very best in today's
testing so if you guys want to get super
mad about that and give me a bunch of
he'll go ahead and tell me what a
terrible person I am in the comments I
don't care
but with that all behind us let's take a
look at the numbers for our
brand-spankin'-new 2018 upgraded PC and
the five-year old outdated version of
itself that can be
so just but so much faster now my
goodness is blazing it's like hashtag
420 blaze in it right now but honestly
what would you expect we literally took
out parts that were around five years
old and swapped him out for mostly
courage and hardware obviously the
performance gifts there are gonna be
pretty substantial as we clearly saw in
the benchmarks so that's if we're
exciting I think this this was five to
six hundred dollars well spent but at
the same time this could have gone many
different ways and so I kind of want to
ask you guys here at the end of the
video how would you have spent that five
to six hundred dollars differently if
you were upgrading the same system I'm
very cute to hear your thoughts I'm sure
you have a lot of opinions about it as
you often do so leave them a down there
in the comments and I'll get around to
read them and stuff um but that's pretty
much it guys I don't know if I'm gonna
like scrap this or like this is a very
functional usable system maybe I'll
donate it or give to someone who needs
one I don't know I don't know yet but
it's it's a great system now I mean it
was a great system for its time before
now it's a great system today so mission
friggin accomplished I feel proud of
myself guys thank you so much for
watching this video go ahead and toss a
like on it if you enjoyed it and get
subscribed to the channel for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon you can
also check me out on floatplane if you
want to watch my videos a full week
early without ads for 3 bucks a month
I'll put a link for that in the video
description until next time guys thank
you so much for tuning in to this one
have yourselves a good one and I'll see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
