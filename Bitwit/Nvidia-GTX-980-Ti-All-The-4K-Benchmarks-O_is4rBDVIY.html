what's up guys so those of you who
follow me on Instagram and the Twitter's
know that I recently picked up the gtx
980ti because reasons and if you somehow
missed the big launch of invidious
latest high end graphics card here is a
hammer to break through the rock you
live under now that you've all arrived
at the surface I'll be showing off some
4k benchmarks of this reference card
from gigabyte to see how she games also
for the rock dwellers who haven't
already watched countless other YouTube
videos on this card allow me to briefly
explain since the reviews have hit the
web the general consensus is that the
gtx 980ti is essentially a Titan X with
256 less cuda cores and half the vram
going from a 12 to a still gratuitous
six gigabyte frame buffer and that's
basically it I mean the 980ti is
essentially using the same GM 200 GPU
it's got the same base and boost clock
memory clock memory bus with TDP even
the reference cooler mimics that of the
Titan X with the exception of shroud
color and the stamped 980ti branding of
course with so many spec 4 spec
similarities it's no surprise that
numerous tests online have already shown
little to no performance gap between
Nvidia's to leading cards it would
almost appear as though the biggest
difference here lies in the pricing with
the Titan X costing a small fortune of
around $1,000 the 980ti comes at an
unbelievably competitive retail price of
just 650 bucks just 250 more than the
recently discounted gtx 980 and 350
dollars cheaper than the titan x
unfortunately like most folks I don't
have a Titan X nor do I have gtx 980 on
hand because as Barnack lee's would say
we're poor people and heinous ly ugly he
never called you guys ugly so although I
won't be comparing these three cards
directly I did run the 980 TI through 6
different games at resolutions up to
Ultra HD to see if this
is the first reasonably priced card
aimed at 4k gaming that we've been
waiting for the unde nvidia z' promise
of a smooth 4k experience the gtx 980ti
also comes DirectX 12 ready for Windows
10 so you get to take full advantage of
the new API finally nvidia has made some
headway in the vr scene with the card's
multi reading technology which optimizes
the rendering process in order to yield
up to two times the pixel shader
performance while these are both
undoubtedly exciting developments at
this point i'm just a tad more
interested in the card's current gaming
performance so to set the stage all
testing was done in my define r5 system
with a 5820k and 16 gigs of DDR 4 on
Windows 8.1 all games were run at max
settings with minimal to no
anti-aliasing while I was eating a bag
of Doritos it affects the results more
than you think to squeeze the most out
of the GM 200 I dialed in a pretty hefty
overclock taking the cards max clock
speed to just south of 1.5 gigahertz and
even with such a boost I was glad to see
the card staying under 87 degrees
Celsius throughout my testing kicking
things right off with GTA 5 we saw
excellent performance at 1080 and 1440
and a somewhat playable experience at 4k
coming in at 40 FPS while you can easily
get away with playing rockstars latest
title on a low-end video card the game's
immense scalability can also bring a
card to its knees with everything maxed
out not to mention having anti-aliasing
enabled out of pure curiosity I decided
to rerun the test at 4k without msaa
and saw a nice jump to 54 frames per
second I should also note that even GTA
5 couldn't max out the card 6 gig frame
buffer as it topped out at around 5 gigs
with Metro last light also being a
hard-hitting title we saw almost the
exact same frame rates across the board
as we did with GTA 5 while the card
continues to chew through 1080 and quad
HD its 4k performance falls short of WoW
when pitted against the developers
taxing in-house a four-engine evolve
follows suit with its 4k results at 41
frames per second though by now we can
guess that the gtx 980ti is capable of
delivering over 60fps in just about any
maxed out game running at 1440 which is
still an exciting proposition we even
get close to tripling our 4k framerate
when moving to 1080 hitman absolution is
a title that's nearly three years old
now but it's
densely-populated crowd scenes and
thorough use of dx11 features can still
make a GPU wet the bed at night however
our card in question did fairly well
nearly hitting 50 FPS at Ultra HD with
MSAA enabled by the way a GPU has never
actually peed the bed
they've clock speed moving on to
battlefield 4 we once again hit closer
to 40 FPS at 4k but see through the roof
gains at 1080 with a hundred and forty
frames per second and finally the card
struggled the most at 4k in Crysis 3
just barely making 30 FPS on average
though still maintaining above 60 frames
per second at 1440 alright so based on
the results we've seen here today new
owners of the gtx 980ti might find the
frame rates a little low for their
tastes when pushing games to their
fullest on their fancy 4k monitors but
if you're like most of us who are ok
with taking the settings and filters
down a notch or two this is the most
affordable card available that can give
you fluid 4k gameplay without many
compromises to say I'm wildly impressed
by the priced performance of this new
card from Team Green is a heavy
understatement as for the Titan X the
extra CUDA cores and 12 gigs of VRAM
will be worth the hefty premium for only
the most serious of content creators and
enthusiasts but if you're simply looking
for the best performing sub $1000 single
GPU graphics card for you to game your
ass off with the gtx 980ti assures us
that no ass will be left behind but
that's gonna do for now guys feel free
