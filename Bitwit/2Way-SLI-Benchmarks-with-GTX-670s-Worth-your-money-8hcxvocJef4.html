little follow-up video to a previous
unboxing I did on ACS's directs you to
GTX 670 and actually managed to score a
second one of these cards so I decided
to do some gaming benchmarks with a
single card and two-way SLI
configurations the results I found were
actually pretty interesting as far as
how the GPUs scale with different games
so I thought I'd share that with you but
first let's take a look at the hardware
that I used so I ran all of these tests
inside of a course a of 600 T I've got a
2600 K overclocked at 4400 megahertz
motherboard I'm using is an Asus p8z 68
V Pro and you guys can kind of take a
look at the rest of the specs right
there
one thing I want to point out is that
both of these cards we're running at
stock clock frequencies the entire time
so no overclocking was done so all the
performance you're going to see from the
following benchmarks are pretty much
representative of what you'd see out of
the box but let's move on to the
benchmarks so starting off with Skyrim
so you can see there hundred nineteen to
133 frames per second definitely not the
most substantial increase in performance
and we did see a seven degree increase
in temperature so didn't scale very well
but that's okay with borderlands 2
we saw a 15% increase still not as great
as I was expecting but we only saw a
three degree increase in temperature and
by the way the temperatures that I'm
giving you I'm giving you the temps of
the hottest the hottest card so the car
that was actually mounted on top
obviously it's not going to be as cool
as the bottom one because that bottom
card is kind of blocking some of the
airflow going through those fans with
hitman absolution you can see we've got
thirty-three point three five percent
increase in performance going from 62 to
83 frames per second
unfortunately this game did rank the
lowest in thermals so we saw a 10 degree
increase in temperature there but far
cry 3 did an even better job than hitman
at seventy two point three six percent
performance increase and we only saw a
seven degree increase in thermals as you
can see guys I've kind of organized
these benchmarks to go from least
scaling performance to most scaling
performance and the winner in my real
world gaming benchmark testing was
field3 excellent from 76 to 142 frames
per second with two-way SLI we saw an
eighty-seven point five eight percent
increase in performance and surprisingly
only a six degree change in thermals so
Bravo battlefield three you are clearly
optimized for dual card configurations
now moving on to the synthetic
benchmarks we started with Metro 2033 as
you can see here it's scaled pretty darn
well and from 43 to 77 fps giving us 80
basically an 80% increase overall and we
only saw a seven degree increase in
thermals so moving on to Unigine Heaven
3.0 we got basically the same ballpark
as we did with Metro 2033 except even a
little bit better so eighty seven point
seven nine percent increase in
performance and eight degree change in
thermals and lastly our top performing
synthetic benchmark was a VP with ninety
one point five percent increase in
performance and only a five degree
change in thermal so that was pretty
impressive
alright that's going to wrap it up for
this video once again this has been the
Asus directs you to GTX 670 and
hopefully you guys gained a little bit
of insight as to how exactly this card
performs in single and dual card
configurations with the games that have
benchmark today so thank you all for
watching share this with your friends if
might interest them and I'll see you all
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
