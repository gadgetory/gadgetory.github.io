now what we're not doing on line 2 we're
going to continue working on hotline to
sort of a passion project of mines can
be my personal gaming system
last time we hit a roadblock because I
was actually missing some fittings that
were required to do some pretty cool
bends that I that I had in mind so I
actually had to wait for ek to send over
some some more supplies and sure enough
they pulled through they actually even
called upon their friends over at
performance pcs dot-com to get the items
shipped to me even faster because they
have of course a bunch of inventory
there so huge shout out to both those
guys performance pcs comm go ahead and
check them out they're a great retailer
that I use all the time as well as ekr
blocks thank you guys so much for
getting this stuff over in timely
fashion but that's besides the point
we're working on hotline 2 today so I'm
pretty pumped and of course we have
furry little friend here hey stinky
little boy what are you doing in here
you're not allowed in here so now that
I'm working from home again be prepared
to see copious amounts of cat hair on me
in almost every video is there any other
right now yeah I think that's one right
there we're giving you away anyway to
get out you want to come out here go on
yeah I don't want you here either and
one more thing before we move on to the
build I just want to give you guys a
quick look at the shooting room as of
now still lots of work to be done but
here's the big melt cabinet with a lot
of my goodies in it it's kind of messy
right now but this is sort of a b-roll
set I guess one of two b-roll sets for
smaller items if I have mini pcs
peripherals I don't have any other plans
for it right now I might well mount the
monitor and clean up the cable
management obviously but for now it's
just kind of a pretty looking b-roll
table that's also left pretty flexible
so I can use it for whatever I need on
the wall to the right of that I've kept
it pretty empty because I need a lot of
space as much space as I can have for
all the shooting equipment cameras and
lights that stuff takes up a lot of
space so it's pretty barren over here on
this wall I have a really slim kind of
storage shelf with all my screws and
various accessories that I use
frequently we also have some batteries I
want to turn this into like a charging
station
maybe I'll wall mount it to save even
more space it's also a toilet bowl
coffee mug that is serving no purpose at
the moment I should probably move that
and then we've got this this is sort of
like the presenting area where I'm gonna
be doing dialogue and stuff for reviews
and unboxing videos things like that
it's also where awesome hardware will be
streamed from every Tuesday you can see
it's sort of a similar layout to the set
I already had you can see it's got that
desk layout that I stole from Paul many
years ago the desk great
here is actually a vertical desk
electronic electric desk so I can raise
it is actually really handy and keeps my
back from hurting when I'm working on
systems and things like that
this quarter oh the table is also gonna
serve as a secondary b-roll table for
larger items that can't fit over here so
things like full-blown systems computer
cases and the like I definitely need
some acoustic foam paneling in here just
to kill the echo sorry I'm also using
the built-in mic on the camera I thought
I was recording to the tascam to my
lovelier but it's the battery died so
crappy audio sorry but that's it I'm
gonna shut up now now you guys know what
the shooting room looks like and what my
sort of plans are moving forward on line
2 we are ready for bending I'm ready to
bend some tubes damn it I've been
waiting for this moment for way too long
I've got all the fittings installed so I
know exactly which runs I need to make
and don't worry these aren't two-tone
fittings they're they're only silver
because the caps aren't on them yet once
the caps are on we'll be all black I
know some people on Twitter were
freaking out about that but what else is
new
alright I'm ready for bending let's bend
some tubes
all right tubes are done it's this is
actually the next day it took me about
three hours to bend all these yeah I
know I'm slow but I was also kind of
being sort of a perfectionist so I
really took my time to make every Bend
just right and I think the final results
for the bends at least is really good
drastically different from the original
hotline but also has sort of its own
funky spin I'm really digging these two
these two bends right here at the front
these are definitely the most
complicated bends as well because they
each had two bends in them and they were
a fairly long tooth of the longest runs
in the entire Bell the other tubes are
all pretty straightforward there's only
maybe one bent to each of them with the
exception of this guy had big two
relatively tight bends but it's a small
tube so it wasn't that difficult I
pretty much nailed every tube on the
first or second try
actually this long one right here I got
on the first try somehow had to do this
other one a couple times though I think
it did it twice this is also the first
custom loop I've ever done with a built
in motherboard erm water block so that
was kind of fun you can see the tube up
there is actually parallel to the one in
front of it and you almost can't see it
from most angles if you look closely you
can see I used a number of extenders in
order to make everything fit just right
and aligned the way I wanted to and then
also there was a sort of a tee fitting
there's like a two way or three way
fitting here I'm only using two the
ports though just so I didn't have to do
a super-long three-way Bend or I guess
it would be a double Bend just to save
me a little bit of headache the tube in
the back isn't perfectly straight mainly
because it's interfering with the pump
res it's all wedged in the back too so
you don't really see it much oh yeah and
then also the drain valve is kind of
hiding right here tucked away this is
the lowest point in the loop so made
sense to put it right here kind of like
how it just tucks away like that
not using so some of you guys who've
been following the build series know
I've been experimenting with different
colors for the coolant mixing dyes and
things like that I still have some ways
to go I'm getting there but it's not
going to be ready in time for this video
so instead of just ending the video here
I'm actually going to fill up the loop
with distilled water and do a little
leak test that way you guys can at least
see some liquid flowing through the
system and should look pretty sweet so
let's do that now
okie-dokie leak test is in progress
got the pump running and the water is
circulating through the loop however the
rest of the system is powered off just
to avoid any kind of accidental damage
or shorting and actually I did encounter
my first leak alright I didn't get it on
camera but and this is not gonna
surprise any of you but I actually made
these two tubes a little too short so
they weren't clearing their respective
or ings meaning there was no effective
seal in place so when I started filling
the loop for the first time water just
started to pool around this bottom GPU
here which wasn't panic inducing at all
but I quickly dried it up of course
there might still be some moisture
inside of the card as long as I don't
power this on for the next 24 hours we
should be good but everything else from
that point forward was pretty smooth the
bad news for you guys is that since I'm
waiting a whole day before I power the
system on at all just to be extra safe
you guys will not be able to see the
system powered on in this video which
means you'll have to wait for part three
where we finally nailed down the fluid
color configure the RGB lighting and
only then will you see hot line 2 in its
final form but I'm really liking how
it's coming along so far those bends and
bends so that's gonna do it for me guys
thank you so much for watching this
video as always toss some wood on it if
you enjoyed it and get subscribed to the
channel for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon have a good one guys I
will see you in the next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
