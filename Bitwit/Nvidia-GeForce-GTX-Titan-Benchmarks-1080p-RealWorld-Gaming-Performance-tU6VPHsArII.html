excited to announce that I will be
giving you all some awesome benchmarks
on Nvidia's latest and greatest GeForce
GTX Titan now for those of you who don't
already know this is in a nutshell a
thousand-dollar GPU that Nvidia is
claiming to be the world's fastest
single GPU card on the market right now
the only two other single GPU cards that
come close to this one are the GTX 680
and the Radeon HD 7970
of course the GTX 690 and the Ares 2
definitely beat this card out in
performance in almost every test that
I've seen online but that's because
those are both dual GPU cards and I will
be getting into the pros and cons of
single GPU and dual GPU cards later on
in this video but for now I will be
testing this card against the msi gtx
680 lightning as well as the Radeon HD
7970 X from H is and those are both
factory overclocked cards so I felt that
they were worthy contenders to go up
against the GTX Titan but enough of my
rambling why don't we get on to the
hardware I'm using alright so I am
rocking all of the hardware that I have
been using since the very beginning of
this channel so still sticking with the
2600 K overclock at 4400 megahertz and
at the bottom there you can see I'm
using the latest AMD and NVIDIA drivers
so for the GTX 680 I ran them with a
three 1407 drivers and with the GTX
Titan I ran them with the dot o nine
drivers as far as I can tell there's no
performance benefit from either of those
drivers the only difference being that
the dot o nine drivers include the GTX
Titan profile take a look at the right
so you can see the specs of the card
there I didn't really want to do an
unboxing or overview on this card
because quite frankly I'm a little late
on this product and I know there's a lot
of content already out there featuring
that kind of thing so if you guys want
to watch a good overview video go ahead
and check out the new egg video that
Paul did on the GTX Titan basically goes
over all the specifications that are
listed here and quite a bit more but
things I did want to point out is that
this does have a core clock or a base
clock of 837 megahertz and a boost clock
of 876 megahertz although I was seeing a
boost clock of about 992 megahertz
right out of the box the overclocked
frequency you see right there at eleven
hundred and sixty two megahertz
that's actually the overclock the
maximum frequency I was able to achieve
by manually overclocking this car
which I guess is a good time to go over
the overclock settings that I used so I
use EVGA s precision X software to do my
overclocking power target is set at 106
percent and just below that you can see
temperature targets and the the timing
right now is the only card where you can
actually adjust this temperature target
because it comes included with NVIDIA
GPU boost 2.0 so in all of the other 600
series cards from Nvidia we saw GPU
boost 1.0 and the difference they are
being is that with GPU boost 2.0 you can
now set parameters based on temperature
so as you can see here I prioritized my
temp target at 83 degrees Celsius which
means my card should never get any
hotter than that boundary so this is
really cool because it offers a
completely new layer of customized
ability when overclocking your card it's
fun to tinker with but also like ok for
example I actually set my voltage to max
I don't even know what number it is just
set to max voltage but I don't have to
worry about how much voltage my card is
being fed at any given moment because my
card ever tries to go over 83 degrees
GPU boost 2.0 is going to keep that
voltage at bay and say whoa voltage this
is all the power we need right now
because we're going past the temp target
threshold so not only is is really cool
because it offers more customized
ability but it's also going to help you
potentially protect your card from
future damage other than that you can
see GPU clock offset I've set at 155
megahertz and the memory clock offset
I've set at a nice round even hundred
and lastly taking a look at the fan
curve monitor to the right there you can
see that I have set the maximum fan
speed to ramp up to 75 percent if it if
the card ever gets to 85 degrees which
in theory it shouldn't right because
I've set the temp target at 83 but
because we're overclocking and all that
stuff I gave it a little bit of leeway
alright so for the first test that Iran
we have assassin's creed 3 and this is a
game I recently added to my list of
benchmarks just because it's a
relatively new game a lot of people are
playing it and it just looks awesome so
it's very graphically intensive and
demanding which is which is good
for benchmarking of course so
everything's set to max and as you can
see here I didn't really see that much
of a performance increase from the Titan
over the gtx 680 lightning but when i
overclocked it however I did see a
pretty big jump going from 56 to 60 four
frames per second so that was nice
sorry 70 90 70 X this definitely wasn't
year-round
moving on to Crysis 3 the game that
everybody wants to see benchmarked right
now the 79 70 X and the 680 lightning
just barely made it over 30 frames with
the 680 just barely beating out the 7970
but you can see there with the Titan we
actually achieved a much higher frame
rate on average going from 48 clock
frequency to 54.6 when when overclocked
and this is honestly the fastest or the
highest frame rate on average that I've
seen from a single GPU card when running
Crysis 3 at full settings I think that's
enough to call this card a crysis 3
killer and that kind of makes me happy
moving on to Skyrim you can see the
results are pretty marginal at this
point but that's also because they just
look that way because the the y-axis
goes all the way up to 140 but you can
see there the 680 got 170 117 frames per
second with the Titan getting 129 the
overclock didn't really do much for us
obviously as you can see there but
that's all going to change with not
borderlands 2 I thought this was a
different game as you can see here the
overclock also didn't get us very much
much further from the stock clock
frequency but we did see quite a bit of
performance increase over the gtx 680
and you're probably wondering where is
the 79 70 X so oh it's way down there I
didn't see you there but that's mainly
because physics was turned on high
during this test and I was trying to
turn it off for this test to be honest
but I couldn't I popped the card in and
when I opened up the settings in
Borderlands 2 the physics setting was
completely grayed out and it wouldn't
let me change it it was just it blocked
me in too high physics setting so I
tried to change it in the dot ini file
or whatever and that wasn't working out
so obviously because the AMD card isn't
optimized for physics all that workload
was offset to the CPU and that's why you
see such a performance hit with
970 X but aside from that the Titan did
pretty well and so did the GTX 680 for
that matter but the overclock on the
Titan was very marginal but now it's all
going to change with far cry 3 yeah
there's the slide I was looking for you
can see here it was almost like an even
staircase leading up to the Titan until
we overclock it then just like Bram
going from seventy six point one frames
to ninety point three that's a pretty
significant overclock performance
increase right there
so if you're playing far cry 3 and you
got Titan you better be overclocking
that I'm going to say at least
one time at least once in every video
hitman absolution we saw another pretty
hefty increase in performance with the
overclock going from ninety four point
four to one hundred and ten point six
frames per second with the GTX Titan but
yeah and also the GTX 680 did finish
last in this test but I did want to
point out that even though the 7970
exbest sit in quite a few of these tests
the lightning is a very cool card and it
remains very like one of the the best
coolers I've seen on a card of this
caliber so I just want to point that out
good job at maasai battlefield three
hundred and thirty five point eight
frames per second yeah I don't even know
that's really necessary but it's kind of
cool to look at right
117 point for the start clock frequency
and we saw 95 and 82 from the 7970 and
the GTX 680 respectively and lastly our
only synthetic benchmark for this video
was 3d mark this is the latest 3d mark
from future mark and I did run the fire
strike extreme test this is the most
demanding and graphically taxing test in
the 3d mark sweet so here taking a look
at the graphic score we actually
breached 5,000 points with the GTX Titan
overclocked and we still breached 4,000
points with the GTX Titan that stock
clock frequencies so that definitely
blew the hell out of the 79 70 in the
GTX 680 it kind of makes a nice little
even staircase there as well alright
guys so after taking a look at the
performance results what do you all
think of the GTX Titan do you think it's
worth the thousand dollar price tag
that's attached to it and honestly I
think it depends on who you ask
because I personally feel NVIDIA is
targeting this card towards a very
specific demographic
and I think that demographic is really
narrowed down to people who may either
have a crap ton of money or people who
be our high-performance users or testers
so if benchmarking is like your
legitimate full-time job you're probably
going to want to pick up one of these
just to have it for comparison and
whatnot or if you're a high-end user
like you have a triple panel display
that you game on constantly at seventy
six eighty by sixteen hundred
resolutions which screw you by the way
if that's if that's what you do but for
the general consumer is it worth it and
I think what you have to really take
into consideration is not just the
straight-up performance that you get out
of this card but also the other included
features that come along with it
for example NVIDIA GPU boost 2.0 and I
didn't mention this earlier but this
card also has the ability to overclock
your monitors refresh rate which are
both both of those features are just
awesome right I think that they're not
like marketing fluff they're not trying
to just sell you on some BS feature I
think they're very useful there's a lot
of customized ability and options there
all right so all limitations aside
pretend that you have a thousand bucks
to spend just you can blow it on
anything money isn't an option so I
think the question then comes down to
why wouldn't you just get a GTX 690
instead of a GTX Titan right because
they're both the same price and in a lot
of the tests that I've seen online the
GTX 690 outperforms the Titan in most of
those tests so I think the reason for
that other than the awesome features
that you get with this I think it also
comes down to the benefits of having a
single GPU card over a dual GPU card
like the GTX 690 so for example you're
going to be getting a lot better
thermals with with a single GPU card
because you don't have a second GPU
that's emitting heat off of it right and
as we all know heat is a GPU killer so
if you're gonna be buying a high-end
card like this chances are you're going
to be wanting to keep it for a very long
time so it makes sense if you get a card
that doesn't run so hot the other thing
is that because you're not generating as
much heat with your card your fan or
fans don't need to spin up as much to
cool down your componentry and because
of that you actually achieve lower
acoustics and a really noisy video card
can really take you out of that
immersive experience when you're trying
to play a game especially if you're not
using a set of headphones for example
and the other thing lastly is that I
feel I feel like you just get more
consistent performance with a single
you card because not every single game
out there is optimized for a dual GPU
card configuration right developers will
always optimize the game for at least
one GPU but they don't always go that
step further and optimize it for two so
I think with all those things considered
I feel like there there is room for for
justification of the thousand dollar
price price point on this card but I
would love to hear you guys thoughts as
well so please feel free to leave your
thoughts in the comment section below on
what you think of the GTX Titan but yeah
that's gonna do for this video guys I
know that was a lot of information to
take in thank you for bearing with me
but hopefully you guys found it
informative and at least a little bit
entertaining as well so I'm Kyle with
awesomesauce news thank you all for
watching and subscribe to the channel if
you haven't already and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
