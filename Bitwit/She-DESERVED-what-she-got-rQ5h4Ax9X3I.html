I see oh I love it I mean it's pretty
much perfect I just wish it was a little
smaller that was easy
so here ask for my spicy mini oh wow you
did something useful for once nice spell
check it next time - seriously Heather
what kind of request was that you're
gonna ruin it for everyone the customer
is always right
ladies ladies there's no need to fight
oh let your voice be heard by visiting
the fractal design contact page and
making a product suggestion within
reason
while you're at it you can also check
out the new mesh if I see Minnie click
on the link below to learn more
what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well I
have a great piece of content plan for
you today that I think you're gonna
really enjoy oh my god I literally just
taped the blinds like five minutes ago
hold on we're back so there are a couple
things that we need to do around the
office to make it better in general more
usable for one these blinds have been
leaking light presumably from the Sun
into our set and causing lots of havoc
it makes it really hard to control the
lighting in here and it's you know you
can get sunspots on our faces
it ruins awesome hardware because it's
usually when right around the time that
the Sun goes down because we're facing
west
so what we're gonna do today is we're
gonna go to a store and buy some
curtains maybe some blackout curtains if
we can find them for a reasonable price
but at the very least we're gonna take
care of this situation here this light
lead and the other thing we'll do if you
look in that direction we'll actually be
looking for another shelf identical to
the one that we put up a few weeks ago
because right now I mean this looks
great but we kind of just need to bridge
the gap here it looks a little plain on
this wall and I'd really like to utilize
this corner of the room for more b-roll
shots and it just doesn't look all that
great as it is so once we get another
identical shelf in here we can put more
crap on it maybe some more pop figurines
or graphics cards I don't know if you
guys have any ideas of what you'd like
to see on this shelf in the future let
us know in the comments I think that's
pretty much all we're doing today it's a
very simple sort of low-key laid-back
straightforward blog and I'm gonna
summon the powers of wifey sauce wifey
sauce hold on wifey sauce isn't home
right now please leave a message
yes yeah this is Kyle your husband I'd
like to take your jacket off and tell
you to stop messing around and help me
measure the damn windows so we can get
started
stop
all right let's measure all right I'm
gonna stand on this chair cuz I'm short
we have a lot of we do oh we do we have
a stepladder don't we get the stepladder
here use the keys no get the ladder
good one who thought of the idea
technically not poking you if I poked
you we just retract remember I'm still
injured from the snowboarding accident
oh alright she's gonna get the
stepladder because we're short and then
we can begin figuring out the dimensions
of this thing we'll probably have to get
two curtains Oh what's up dude ah thank
you very much sir we have a guest who
has delivered a package he works and he
works in our little mini suite here so
the head of the camera this is Bradley
thank you very much sir impromptu
unboxing what is oh these are the Noctua
fans that came that came like a day late
I actually don't need these anymore
yay stepladder magic bad things
happening standing up on a ladder
surrounded by glass on the floor
probably not the best idea well we kind
of have to measure or actually no I
guess we don't really need to measure
that let's do the bottom here yeah I was
like that's so common sense and I wasn't
even thinking about it I have learned
that I cannot blog and think at the same
time alright this looks like 15 feet and
5 inches 15 feet 5 inches can feet 5
inches this is 5 feet why don't we do 5
feet 10 inches we probably can't find a
single curtain rod that goes all the way
across that's very easily yeah so we'll
just we'll just buy to the other thing
that we need to measure is the shelf so
I was thinking we would just get another
nine-foot slab that's also about as long
of a piece of wood we can fit in my car
so we're kind of limited to that but
let's see how that looks on the wall
where does that go out to right there
that's pretty good right I don't think
we need it much longer than that all
right I think we're good I think we can
go to the store right we're ready ready
to go all right can we film in there
no probably not
I hate you so much all right we just
landed up The Home Depot and we're here
to get some wood for our shelf it's
pretty cool down here so breathing
should we get a cart
did you get that on tape what oh my
would did you ever think that my would
would be big enough for you to just rest
your arm on never thought that David's
um this is like the perfect size it is
that's what everyone tells me see Chris
is a real friend real friends measure
honey honey over there I said don't park
here why did you see my one so big it's
just a distraction it's really just a
burden a burden I carry on my shoulders
because that's the only way I can lift
it Bed Bath and Beyond we are here on
the hunt for blackout curtains room
darkening noise-reducing curtains for a
noise reduction Nick Ulis maybe we
should put curtains in a case oh uh 100%
blackout right here yeah these are yeah
do you wait hold on to you how this
isn't gonna cover two windows Bay this
is gonna cover one window do you have
the dimensions she's trolling she's
trolling for the video no I might have
forgotten that all right let's get on
with that oh look I magically found it
oh I actually did forget wait all the
measurements we took you had one job one
okay but I actually remember it was 5
feet by 10 inches it was 5 feet 10
inches tall and then offer window
standard to be 5 15.5
eight 15 feet five inches and you're
willing to bet your life on this you're
fired
babe okay close me we just need four of
these we just need four of these for
sure yes how long is this fifteen
sixteen fifty inches wide in 1595 inches
so we would need four of them like I
said we need four like I said with the
black ones they're blackout curtains
they're not blue out curtains I'm not
all right the blue ones ludis get these
suckers drop them in get them rods
we've got 88 144 it's not the same brand
$70 each a hundred and forty-four rods I
mean I might just chop my wiener off and
sell that it times get rough how much
are the curtains hold on it's $40 50 50
50 your curtains are you kidding me all
right what about like just what if we
just duct tape the windows Oh
get Oh are you trying to make the office
look it'll be covered up by the blinds
sometimes you might want natural
lighting I don't even need the Sun to be
honest it's overrated babe
that's $200 in cloth well do we have
like a old comforter we can hang up with
bobby pins on the iron
oh my gosh someone broke into our office
and completely thrashed the place what
the hell is going on no I'm just kidding
this is the mess that we made when
installing these amazing curtains holy
moly
they are super sexy a wifey sauce
approves you can see that we've got them
held together by clothes pins and that's
just to ensure that we don't get any
sudden leakage the Sun has gone way down
so we can't really test it out but I'm
pretty confident that this is exactly
the solution we needed and then the
Shelf the second shelf also installed
very nicely looks so much better now I
mean even though it's a complete
disaster in here and there's nothing on
the shelf yet I can already tell this is
gonna be really nice for the camera I
know it some of you guys are thinking
that this looks very similar to Paul
setup and I am guilty as charged but you
know what thanks Paul for the
inspiration I do love your setup and I'm
just trying to copy you because I admire
you so much
you know what they say what do they say
imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery but you know what I do plan to
make it a little bit more my own I'm
gonna have maybe some cool stuff on this
shelf again if you guys have any ideas
drop it in the comments that's gonna
pretty much conclude it for now I mean
this was a really simple and sort of
straightforward blog it was kind of more
low-key than my usual blocks our usual
