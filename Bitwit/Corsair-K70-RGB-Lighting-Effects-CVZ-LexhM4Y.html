up guys so a few weeks back I posted an
extensive walkthrough on the k70 RGB
software which was so long RGB keyboards
have become mainstream by the end of it
and while I had a fun time learning the
software over the years I never got to
just take a step back from video
production and actually play around with
the keyboards lighting effects so for
this video I decided to lock myself in a
dark room with the k70 RGB and have my
way with it needless to say the keyboard
has already filed a restraining order
against me now being that I only gave
myself a day or so to throw some
lighting effects together I've seen far
more complex creations out there than
the ones I'm showing you today but at
the very least this should give you a
much better idea of what's possible on
an RGB keyboard from Corsair so let's
have a look starting out fairly simple
with a touch of Christmas spirit my
first program is a flashy wave effect
using popular Christmas colors I used a
white background lighting for each key
and red and green for the wave itself
which fans out on both sides at a
slanted angle starting from the middle
of the keyboard I added five color
markers to the gradient and gave it a
high number of tail lights to make the
color span whiter across the board I
also added some multi type lighting
using the ripple effect which emits a
gentle burst of silver and gold from
whichever key is pressed all colors used
were set for full brightness and
intensity for optimal Christmas cheer
here's a look at the whole effect in the
dark
for the next mode I did I wanted to
create something a little more subtle
that was still cool to look at so here
we have my ember effect I started out by
putting each row of the keyboard into
groups and assigning them one-way wave
effects of slightly different velocities
each wave was then given a long tail and
set to travel in opposite directions of
the one above it using a blend of reds
oranges and yellows I used varying
intensity levels between colors to
imitate the pulsating glow you might see
from a burning log for example to fill
in all the dark keys left over by a
passing wave I applied a long dim
gradient across the board for a cohesive
glowing effect finally I added some
single type lighting to give the keys an
extra red glow when pressed
as I watched the heavy rain pour outside
my window while plotting my next
lighting mode the thought occurred to do
a rain effect and I'm still baffled at
how it came to me thirty seconds later I
was staring at a rather repetitive and
uninteresting wave of a blue so I
decided to add something more electric
to the equation by illuminating certain
keys for a brief moment at different
intervals I was able to create the
illusion of lightning bolts striking
down on the keyboard each group or bolt
uses a solid effect with the twenty
second duration but only flashes white
for half a second at a unique position
on the twenty second time line this was
to prevent two bolts from striking in
the same place even my lighting effects
will be the laws of nature you should
get on my level sometime it's nice here
I then triggered a big flash to go off
every few seconds to emphasize a full
blown lightning storm to finish things
off I added a single type gradient
effect with several black and white
markers in a short duration to give off
a really nice flash effect
for my last effect I wanted to go all
out and see how many seizures I could
induce by bringing the light show right
to your desk so now all you raver kids
can take ecstasy in your own home like
adults
the main effect here is a rapid firing
horizontal wave with a dead zone in the
middle that I reserved for a smaller
vertical wave acting as a centerpiece of
sorts for this mode the F keys were
handled similar to the lightning bolts
in the last effect broken up into four
separate groups with solid white flashes
of light on a much shorter time line the
four columns of the keypad were also
split into groups including the
corresponding multimedia keys above them
upward wave effects using the same
speeds but different intervals were then
applied for a staggered aesthetic which
looks particularly cool when the light
reaches the multimedia Keys up top
throw in a pulsing brightness button and
a not so quiet mute button and you've
got a keyboard that's groovy enough to
do the melbourne shuffle
all right so those are my effects I'm
sure by now you guys can see how much
more I was able to accomplish this time
around than in my last k70 RGB video
clearly I'm still a long way off from
mastering the software but after enough
tinkering and experimentation I can
finally say I get it and now that I have
a thorough understanding of how the
software works bringing my imagination
to life and the program is actually
quite addicting so I sure enjoyed making
this video toss me a like if you enjoyed
watching it and let me know what cool
effects you've seen or programmed
yourself with a corsair RGB keyboard by
the way if you want to use any of the
effects i showed off today i've also put
links to their respective mode files in
the description below as always don't
forget to bookmark my amazon affiliate
link and pick up a torso chassis like
this one in the new awesomesauce Smurfs
store the sizes range from Mini ITX all
the way up to e-atx so no matter your
form factor I've got you covered
well the shirt has you covered but yeah
also please consider making a monthly
contribution on patreon to help the
awesomesauce cause I'm Kyle with
awesomesauce Network thank you guys for
watching subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and I'll see you in the
next video
it's just me and you now it's just me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
