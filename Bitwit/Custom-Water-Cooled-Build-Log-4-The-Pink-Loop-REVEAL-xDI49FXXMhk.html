honey sounds like it went really well
yeah I'm glad to be home is that a
computer case yeah it's the define us
from fractal design they run so quietly
I figured I'd put it there as a reminder
that in this crazy hectic world
silence really is golden is that the
same computer case yeah the define and
supports triple radiators water cooling
pumps and reservoirs so I think you're
not put one there just to remind myself
to be flexible in life really in the
bathroom why well yeah I figured the
toilet hasn't been working lately and
the define us has such a spacious
interior that I just thought my god the
define s from fractal design is built
for uncompromised custom water cooling
please use responsibly click the link in
the description for more info what's up
guys welcome back to build log 4 of my
custom water cooled build I am super
excited to announce that today I'm
actually going to be putting this damn
thing together now before you get too
excited that doesn't mean the completed
build is going to be ready by the end of
this video I'm still going to need to do
some finishing touches like the cable
sleeping as well as adding in some LEDs
potentially in the future but you are
going to be able to see me build the
actual loop I'm going to be filling it
with that beautiful pink loop liquid and
we're going to get an overall look our
closest look at the finished build that
we've had since the beginning of this
bill blog so super exciting stuff there
are a couple little things I need to do
before I start the build process however
including flushing the radiators just to
get all the little bits and gunk out
that were leftover from the
manufacturing process which is fairly
simple to do so once I'm done with that
we're going to start building there's a
couple feel feel little things minor
things that have happened since the last
build blog that I haven't documented yet
you might have saw seen this on my
Instagram
but I did paint the corners the little
tabs here the PCIe slots that my video
cards are gonna be going into I painted
them black with the black spray paint as
well as this SATA port right here which
used to be beige used to be the color of
all the beige on on the motherboard by
spray painted that black as well the
only reason I did these three things is
because they are going to be stay or
gonna be standing out the most and they
will not be covered by any other
components once the build is finished
and I didn't want that beige showing
through too much so that's why I kind of
left the the PCIe slot itself alone
because you're not gonna be able to see
those once the video cards are installed
anyway
oh also I spray-painted the PCI slots
now these are not the finished products
these are testers I originally sprayed
some primer on them and it wasn't clear
primer it was actually dark these used
to be white PCI slots I spray paint
coated them once or twice with some dark
grey primer which was not a good idea
because it actually forced me to have to
use several pink coats color coats more
than I than I wanted to and I kind of
ended up with this purpley you know
darker shade of pink that I really
wanted so the other ones my second batch
are drying in the drying in the garage
right now I just spray-painted them
about half an hour ago and they're
already looking a lot better because I
did not use any primer this time around
I just spray-painted straight onto the
white slot and they're already looking a
lot better and they're definitely more
true to our pink fuchsia color that
we're trying to go for in the liquid so
my damn camera will focus so one thing
I'm not a huge fan of on this camera
autofocus could be much improved I love
God Mother of God
there we go there we go so now let me
take you over to our little flushing
station remember kids always flush it's
the courteous thing to do take a look
over here you can see my 360 radiator is
all good to go
it's ready for flushing I've got a
funnel here just stick that in there I'm
not going to show you guys exactly how
to do it step-by-step
but the basic procedure here is you get
some distilled water make sure it's
distilled don't just use regular tap
water that's a no-no so I just picked
this up at sprouts you can get any
pretty much grocery store drugstore this
was a dollar for a gallon so cheap stuff
stock up on it so you don't run out and
you're just gonna fill it up there until
your radiators I don't know half to
three-quarters full and then you plug
them up either use some plugs or I
usually just stick my thumbs in into the
holes and then you just shake it
vigorously for a while and then you
drain it you let it all out into the
sink or the bathtub or whatever and
usually more often than not you'll see
little bits and flakes coming out I
already flushed my 240 radiator and you
can't really see was actually pretty
clean to begin with you don't see much
much gunk in there and a lot of it's
probably just from the sink before I
even started flushing but it is good
procedure and protocol to do before
because once you have the loop built you
don't want a little little bits of crud
flying floating around in here in your
system and that's going to look really
nasty and also potentially affect
performance more importantly so I'm
going to give this a couple flushes two
to four flushes until everything looks
good and nothing else is coming out and
then we're going to start building this
thing so brace yourselves it's going to
be awesome
here we go
all right boys and girls the loop has
finally been bled and well let me take a
look at it here there it is the bleeding
process was relatively simple I got
through it okay hit a few snags but
nothing too serious I guess I'll just
dive right into the things I learned
from this experience first off and my
buddy Jay from Jays two cents helped me
out with this quite a bit I texted him
last night in a panic and he put me at
ease but apparently when I first bled
this thing and I had powered it on it
the fluid wasn't actually flowing
through the loop it was just kind of
stagnant I could see a little bit of
trickling on this tube right here but it
wasn't actually getting full and even
the little air bubbles in this tube
right here weren't moving at all so I
thought for a second that maybe my pump
was defective and I almost had a heart
attack but Jay let me know that because
I'm using a PWM type pump they tend to
spin at really really low rpms unless
the cable the the 4-pin header is
plugged in to a pwm header on your
motherboard or something similar so I
had actually just had this pump wired to
an external power supply right there and
nothing else was powered on and
apparently it was just spinning so
slowly that it looked like it wasn't
even working so what I did was I just
powered up the motherboard and then I
plugged in the the cable into one of the
PWM headers on that saber tooth and
fired it up and sure enough everything
was fine so Thank You Jay thanks for
saving my life I owe you one buddy
apart from that another thing that I
learned in this whole experience is by
more fluid than you think you need as
you can see here I hate you autofocus I
hate you as you can see here I have not
purchased enough fluid to fill my
reservoir and I guess this really
applies to people with multiple
radiators in their system and a fairly
large reservoir is like mine right here
if you really want to get it filled up
and get that nice clean aesthetic look
because obviously this doesn't look that
great you might need more than one liter
of whatever fluid you're using but
obviously you can still run the loop
just fine it just won't look as nice
when it's half-full or whatever the
other thing that I learned is
is you know never never underestimate
expectations versus reality when you're
planning a custom loop like this because
up until now all of this this whole
build has just been an image in my head
you know I and I'm not going to know
you're never going to know what its
gonna look like
until you actually build it and I'm not
gonna say that I hate it or anything but
I'm not necessarily in love with it as
much as I thought I would be and I think
that's also having to do with having not
having to sleeping in there I think once
I have some pink sleeping for the video
cards in the ATX cable I think I'm gonna
like it a lot more also once the venturi
fans the three venturi fans are up here
on the 360 radiator that's going to be
pretty cool but also like I said before
I think I mean we have a straight
fitting right here because I want to
extend the tubing and I want to make it
a little bit more curvaceous it's just a
little too straightforward for me right
there and also I might get a t-connector
instead of having one separate one for
the drain and one for the outlet to the
loop I think I'm just going to combine
it into one fitting basically a splitter
fitting and I think that'll look a lot
cleaner additionally do you hear that
noise I hear it listen listen carefully
where is it where's it coming from
wait ah a little the little mini fan on
the sabre-tooth x99 is noisy as hell so
that's not gonna fly with me but that's
okay because asus includes this little
this little shield right here that you
can just swap out for the fan and there
you go no more fan and this also brings
up a nice opportunity for some color
theme modification as well because when
I was looking at this originally after
I'd first bled the loop I thought you
know there's really a lot of pink
towards the right side of the case and
not so much on the left I tried my best
with the PCI slots which turned out
really nice I'm actually really happy
with how those turned out but there's
just a little bit of pink lacking in
this upper region to the left of the
case toward the back so I think what I'm
going to do is I know I've been
spray-painting like a madman but I think
I'm gonna spray-paint this pink or at
least try to well I'm not gonna try it
I'm gonna freakin do it damn it and I
think that'll add just a little bit more
pink in that rather empty region and I
did also want to
that I am going to try my hand at hard
line tubing in this system in the future
probably in the near future actually
because now that I've done the soft
tubing I'm like okay been there done
that I kind of want to try hard line
tubing like I said I am not in love with
with the way the the tubing looks in
here but I think that hard line tubing
would really make it look pretty damn
sweet and just have a lot cleaner lines
all together and of course it's a good
learning experience and you know I might
as well do it sooner than later but that
is pretty much gonna wrap it up for this
build blog guys thank you so much for
joining me like I said we've got a
couple more of these before the system's
fully ready to go and thank you all for
