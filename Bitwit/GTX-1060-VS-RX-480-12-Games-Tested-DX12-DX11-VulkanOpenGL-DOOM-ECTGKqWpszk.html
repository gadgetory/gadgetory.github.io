bit of a follow up to my GTX 1060 and
our X 480 reviews in order to take a
closer look at both cards performance in
modern AP eyes such as DirectX 12 in
Vulcan over the past year or so I've
locked down a number of go-to
benchmarking apps to improve the
efficiency and consistency of my testing
but with so many new AP eyes on the rise
in 2016 my existing suite of benchmarks
could use a serious update especially
when testing GPUs that are now more
optimised for newer ap eyes than ever
before so today I'm calling in a rematch
between nvidia gtx 1060 and AMD Tsar X
480 where the two go head-to-head in 12
different applications across some of
today's leading api's this is currently
one of the more heated GPU matchups in
the PC industry as the cards offer
similar performance and fall into the
sub $300 price range making them both
attractive offerings for mainstream
gamers hopefully today's results will
help us paint a clearer picture of how
the cards measure up overall on the test
bench I'll be using the GTX 1060
founder's Edition and the reference rx
488 gigabyte model with the latest
drivers on Windows 10 both cards were
manually overclocked as far as I could
take them without touching the voltage
and were accompanied by my core i7 59 60
X at 4,400 megahertz and 16 gigs of DDR
4 at 21 33 on that notes keeping things
short and sweet here let's cut right to
the chase and have a look at the
benchmarks
all right and finally we have doom
running Vulcan which like directx12
is not yet supported by fraps so here's
some actual gameplay footage with the
game's built-in Frank owner just a
second ago we saw the R X 480 get
trounced by the GTX 1060 when playing
this game in OpenGL but with Vulcan the
roles are completely reversed as the R X
480 consistently outperforms by as much
as 50 FPS over the gtx 1060 now Vulcan
has already made appearances as a proof
of concept in games like the Talos
principle but Doom is really the first
title to showcase the api's performance
benefits and the numbers we're seeing
here should leave us excited to see more
game supporting the new API but those
are all the tests ladies and gentlemen
and I think that's probably the most
benchmarks I've ever shown in one video
so one way I tried to make sense of all
this data was to add up the total number
of frames generated by each card per
resolution over the games we tested and
what we find is that the GTX 1060 is no
doubt the faster card overall yielding
12 percent more frames than the RX 480
at 1920 by 1080 and just 2 percent more
frames at 2560 by 1440 it's kind of
interesting to see how much the our X
480 closes in on the GTX 1060 at the
higher resolution presumably with the
help of its larger frame buffer
once again I added up the total number
of frames from each card but this time
based on API instead of resolution in 10
of the games tested half using DirectX
11 the other half DirectX 12 the GTX
1060 beats out the RX 480 in DirectX 11
gaming by 10% however our score shows
the our X 480 taking a sizeable lead of
nearly 18% in titles using DirectX 12
there's a more than likely chance that
this is due to the rx 4 ATS vastly
superior optimization for asynchronous
compute which DirectX 12 can benefit
from significantly in a way today's
results represent a sort of
transitionary period for pc gaming where
newer api's and technologies like Aysen
compute are just now starting to take
hold and it seems as though AMD is
notably more equipped to embrace these
big changes than its competition with
the majority of games still using
DirectX 11 it's true that the GTX 1060
has the overall upper hand but I would
imagine it won't be much longer before
the scales tip in AMD's favor should
Nvidia fail to effectively implement the
use of async compute engines in their
graphics cards but that is gonna do it
