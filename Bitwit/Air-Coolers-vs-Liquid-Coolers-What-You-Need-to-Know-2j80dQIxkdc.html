elimination click the link in the
description to find out more so you're
looking to build a shiny new PC and try
your luck at undertaking one of the most
gratifying activities known in the
enthusiast realm overclocking your CPU
you know that you'll need a decent CPU
cooler if you want to get anywhere but
you've done enough research at this
point to know that the measly stock
cooler which came with your unlocked
processor isn't gonna cut it
on the other end of the spectrum the
cost and complexity of a custom water
cooling loop is almost as overwhelming
as building a computer itself and you'd
rather not get too ahead of yourself so
you're left with two options and
aftermarket air cooler or an AI o liquid
cooler while there are certainly pros
and cons to both methods of cooling
today will Pitt air coolers against
liquid coolers over the course of five
rounds or categories to help you decide
which cooler type is best suited for
your overclocking needs kicking off the
first round is cost now this is an
important consideration for most
builders on a fixed budget as money
saved on the CPU cooler could equate to
more spending power on other components
in the build in most cases air coolers
are typically cheaper than their liquid
counterparts with a much wider range of
options in the sub $60 price range
budget gaming pcs built for overclocking
can often get more mileage out of
choosing a competitively priced air
cooler and allocating the extra savings
towards a better graphics card for
example although you can certainly find
a handful of high-end coolers that cost
more than most entry-level a i/os air
cooling is generally the budget
friendlier option and thus takes the
point for this round another factor to
consider when deciding between air or
liquid cooling is compatibility after
all there's really no use in having the
best cooler on the market if it doesn't
fit your computer fortunately both
cooler types support nearly all of
today's popular CPU sockets whether
you're rockin AMD or Intel so if it's
not the socket that's holding us back
the biggest limitation here when it
comes to cooler compatibility is going
to largely depend on your case
we're talking about mid Tower or full
tower jassi's which are the most common
types of cases for first-time builders
there really are a ton of options that
support both air and liquid coolers even
some of the largest air coolers can fit
in most mid towers though tales of giant
heat sinks too tall for the case side
panel to fit on aren't unheard of
another thing to look out for with air
coolers is that models with wider heat
sinks can sometimes interfere with your
system memory especially if your ram has
particularly tall heat spreaders so it's
best to check the clearance specs early
on as I mentioned before builders with
AIO coolers have a ton of mid towers and
full towers to choose from of course as
your cooler size increases your list of
compatible cases gets shorter for
example don't expect to see nearly as
many case options when going from a
cooler with a 240 to a 280 millimeter
radiator while the waterblock on your
AIO won't give you any RAM clearance
issues the radiator and fans might
interfere with your heat spreaders or
even the componentry near the top of
your motherboard this depends on several
factors including your case layout the
height of your heat spreaders the width
of your radiator or whether or not
you're opting for a push-pull
configuration the best advice I can
really offer you is to do your research
beforehand to make sure that your liquid
cooler plays nicely with the rest of
your Hardware at this point I'd be fine
with calling this round of wash however
there's one more proponent here that
inevitably tips the scales which is the
limitation of AO coolers in the Mini ITX
arena now there are a handful of small
form-factor cases out there that do
support water cooling but the list
really pales in comparison to the almost
endless lists of cases that allow air
cooling support and this is simply due
to the basic two-piece design of air
coolers which allows for tons of small
low-profile options even with the
smallest water block an AO cooler would
still need to find room for its radiator
fans and tubing a situational drawback
in this category that keeps the air
coolers slightly ahead of the game now
equally important as performance some
might argue is acoustics or the noise
level that a component makes when in use
so cooler master for example could have
easily squeezed more performance out of
their top selling hyper 212 Evo if they
bundled it with two 3,000 rpm fans but
then the damn thing would have sounded
like a jet engine and probably not have
sold as well as it did now air coolers
usually come with one fan with beefier
models adding
or even a third but apart from the fans
themselves that's basically the only
sound source you have to worry about
liquid coolers on the other hand come
equipped with anywhere from one to three
fans with the option to expand up to six
fans for extreme setups but unlike air
coolers the fans aren't the only sound
source on a iOS other componentry in the
loop like the pump or even the liquid
itself can potentially create audible
noise depending on the cooler now that
being said the liquid cooler does have a
few tricks up its sleeve to help make it
as quiet as an air cooler such as using
software to create a fan curve now
tuning a fan curve allows you to do
things like gradually ramp the RPM of
your radiator fans up and down based on
the temperature of your CPU or you can
set the max rpm parameters to ensure
that your fans never go beyond a
specific audible target if you're cooler
and software allows it you can even tune
the pump speed curve which functions in
much the same way as the fan curve does
but with the built-in pump in your water
block of course if the pump on your
particular cooler runs at a fixed speed
you could be at the mercy of its current
noise level overall liquid coolers may
require a bit more maintenance to
sustain the same amount of quiet as
their air-cooled brethren but advances
in software control and pump design in
recent years I feel have leveled the
playing field enough to where both sides
are capable of near silent operation
making this round a wash now where the
pump and coolant of a liquid cooler
might be a slight drawback when it comes
to acoustics they do have the potential
to take on even more serious
implications in terms of reliability
pumps can break or fail rendering the
entire unit useless or the liquid inside
your cooler can evaporate over time
making a noticeable difference in
performance many years later down the
line additionally while it's become more
of an uncommon occurrence these days ãão
coolers are still prone to leaks
typically where the tubes meet the water
block or the radiator now of course the
nature and severity of the leak will
determine whether or not the cooler is
salvageable and in an absolute
worst-case scenario the liquid can leak
on to other components in your system
potentially causing permanent damage now
I know everything I just said makes
liquid coolers out to be like the Grim
Reaper of PC hardware or something but
that's not at all the case so before you
go running for the hills I just want to
clarify that these are just some of the
things that could possibly happen
- you're cooler not things that will
probably happen to your cooler I just
want to be clear on that distinction now
be that as it may
air coolers are still the clear Victor
here I mean unless the heat pipe gets
fatally punctured or a console gamer
sneezes on your heatsink the fan is
really the only thing in an air cooler
that has the potential to fail and the
absence of any liquid offers up a dry
solution with zero risk of unforeseen
leakage or water damage and that brings
us to our fifth and final round which I
have purposely saved for last
because it's probably the aspect people
look for most when shopping for a CPU
cooler and that is performance now
getting right into the thick of it I
want to lay to rest the obnoxious long
time is conception that liquid coolers
outperform traditional heat sinks hands
down across the board because that
simply is not true when it comes to peer
cooling many of the best air coolers
currently on the market wiped the floor
with entry level AAA OS and come within
just a few degrees of top shelf liquid
coolers if you're looking for a
landslide victory you're just gonna have
to venture out into the ranks of the
custom water cooling elite but yes at
face value you could very well argue
that the best AO liquid cooler available
probably beats out the best air cooler
available by a small to moderate margin
in terms of raw overclocking performance
but also bear in mind that you'd
probably be paying a lot more for that
AO cooler than you would be for the air
cooler as price to performance should
always be a consideration seeing as how
this is strictly a performance round
however this final point does go to
liquid now before we finally wrap up
here with some closing words I thought
it would be fun to throw in a sixth
bonus round for aesthetics this is
always a subjective category for any
comparison but still one worth
mentioning for those in search of that
extra Flair for their PC if I'm speaking
personally I think air and liquid
coolers both have the same capacity to
look really good or really effing bad
like what the hell is that I mean come
on I personally like the clean modern
look that a pump block and water cooling
tubes can bring to a rig on the other
hand sometimes there's nothing more
badass to me than a big beefy air cooler
with some sweet fans naturally a lot of
this also depends on how the cooler
complements the rest of the components
in the rig at the end of the day it
really does all boil down to user
preference and what you think looks good
it is your personal computer after all
so where does all
this leave you as a first time PC
builder well hopefully with the newfound
knowledge I've bestowed upon you you are
now well equipped to make the decision
of air or liquid cooling yourself but if
by chance you're still yearning for that
definitive answer from an outside party
I suppose I will oblige the way I see it
is that unless you absolutely need that
extra little bit of overclocking
Headroom you might as well save some
money and stick with a reliable air
cooler I mean you can still achieve
great thermals with an air cooler
without sacrificing acoustics and you
can do it all with little to no
maintenance which makes it a no-brainer
for first-time builders less complexity
means less things to worry about and
when the cooler does become obsolete
someday you can always be purposive as a
paperweight at the same time I do find
certain validations in opting for an AO
liquid cooler I use one myself everyday
having that extra bit of overclocking
Headroom can make things fun as it
allows you to further stretch the limits
of your CPU also if your case has a side
panel window having a sleek little water
Block in there can really let you
appreciate the aesthetic of your
motherboard and memory a bit more than
if you were to have it installed a
massive air cooler I also tend to find
the installation process of a iOS to be
a bit easier without having to work
around a cumbersome heatsink but there
you guys have it hopefully this gives
you some insight as to which type of
cooler is right for you I also want to
