months of waiting and teasing and rumors
and speculation the first batch of
Valve's long-awaited steam machines are
finally upon us but how do the
living-room centric PC console hybrid
box things actually perform well I can't
speak for all of them I do have one
particular model on hand with me today
this is the zou tec-9s n 970 and it's
being touted as the most powerful small
form-factor steam box so far with its
quad core Core i5 6400 T skylake CPU at
2.8 gigahertz eight gigs of RAM one
terabyte of storage and a full not
mobile gtx 960 with a three gig frame
buffer on a 192 bit bus those of you who
know your GPUs like the back of your
hand probably noticed that the reference
gtx 960 sports two gigs of VRAM on a
128-bit bus and I've confirmed with
ZOTAC that this is actually the OEM
version of the gtx 960 which features
those higher specs I'll put a link to
that in the description the box itself
sports a black and white plastic
enclosure that's roughly three to four
times larger than something like an
Intel nook but still slim enough to fit
comfortably in a living room environment
one big oversight here is that there's
no included stand to orient the Box
upright which would have allowed twice
as much flexibility for users with
limited space the absence of any
ventilation slots on the right side
would have made this an easy feature to
add that said you do get plenty of
ventilation around the rest of the unit
and a loud and proud steam logo on top
at the front is a large power button
with a white power LED that's slightly
distracting not due to its brightness
but rather its size a USB 3.0 and SD
card slot combo with UHS to support
audio jacks and the USB 3 type C port
around back you'll find DC power a pair
of USB 2 and 3 ports for hdmi 2.0
outputs for multi display dual gigabit
ethernet lan and a connector with
included antenna for 802 AC Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth 4.0 one of the big selling
points that set certain steam machines
apart from their console counterparts is
having significantly more expandability
options two thumb screws on the back
allow users to remove the bottom panel
in order to access some of the unit's
internal hardware here we see ZOTAC has
left one som slot unpopulated if you
wish to add another
a cake module apart from being able to
replace the two and a half inch
mechanical drive there's also support
for a single SATA M to drive at forty to
sixty or eighty millimeter lengths
seeing is how nen comes with a steam
controller as well which we'll touch on
later an internal USB port can be used
for connecting the controllers receiver
though you can also opt to connect the
dongle externally to the unit itself or
to the included adapter for better
signal now while there's nothing
revolutionary about the hardware here
though Tech's experience what they're
successful ZBOX line has positioned them
quite nicely when it comes to making
steam machines and they've done a fine
job here at cramming some capable
hardware into a small footprint as soon
as we press the beckoning power button
however this review switches its focus
almost entirely to valve and what
they've been able to do with their Linux
based steam OS and in-house controller
now booting into the OS took me just shy
of a minute 20 which is partly due to
limitations of the mechanical hard drive
although there's probably a way to clone
steam OS onto an end to drive it would
have been nice to find an easy clone
utility tool in the OS for less
experienced Linux users upon booting up
were met with a simple home menu where
we can navigate the different pockets of
the OS starting with web browsing the
first thing I noticed when jumping onto
YouTube is that the web pages are
somewhat fitted to the screen but not
perfectly so you constantly find
yourself sliding left and right when
you're simply trying to scroll up and
down which can get pretty annoying
now the preset controls for browsing
aren't horrible but they definitely make
this section of the OS the least
intuitive to navigate since the right
trackpad is reserved for cursor movement
it only felt natural to me that clicking
in would register a left click but for
some reason this action has been
assigned to the triggers instead it was
the first time I've ever had to shoot my
way out of a pre-roll sure you can use
the a button to click but that's just
too far away from the trackpad to be
practical if you're not happy with the
default controller configurations you
can browse a list of user made profiles
or create your own so at the moment it
seems modifying the web browser and big
picture profiles is off limits until a
future patch inside the browser you can
perform simple tasks like refresh and
add favorites but you can actually
access the URL bar up top with your
cursor instead you have to press X to
open an action menu first whereas I
would have liked to see options for both
typing with the steam controller is done
with an on-screen keyboard that's split
in half and navigated by the two track
pads this is actually one of the more
successful implementations of the OS and
divides a fairly precise typing
experience for web browsing and chatting
that comes naturally after a bit of
practice moving on to the steam store
everything is neatly organized easy to
navigate and equally unsafe for your
wallet one gripe I have here is that the
preview videos are on autoplay and the
only way I've been able to pause them is
by going fullscreen
which brings up the playback menu why
one of the unassigned track pads
couldn't handle this function I'm not
too sure on the plus side steam lists
the system requirements for all games so
you don't end up buying a title that's
not supported by steam OS or the
limitations of your hardware while
there's currently around 1,500 supported
games on the OS any titles outside of
that group can be streamed locally from
a nearby PC the screen quality is
nothing to write home about but it's
sharper than most other Stream boxes
I've seen and it still looks better than
a console although that's not saying
much
the downside as is with most streaming
devices is the slight but constant input
lag that makes it tough to play fast
paced shooters and the like and I did
experience them stuttering every few
minutes which really pulls you out of
the game
so what about the games that you
actually can play natively on this
device
after all if this thing tanks at playing
games what use does it have other than
an expensive cheese plate
well from the 5 different games I tested
all of the managed to deliver a solid
gameplay experience on high settings at
1080p FPS counter the image seems
buttery smooth and looks great on a big
screen all the while the Box stays
relatively quiet under load overall the
quality here is what you'd expect when
gaming on a desktop PC and this is where
the steam machine really shines as far
as I could tell the only thing holding
back my gameplay experience was the
steam controller granted it's nice to be
able to use game specific user generated
profiles but I still can't tell whether
there's a steep learning curve to aiming
with the trackpad or if it just doesn't
work that well either way I can imagine
most folks will take the time to figure
it out before plugging in an Xbox one or
360 controller which worked beautifully
I might add with all the games I tested
except for left 4 dead 2 I see what you
did there valve both trackpads feature
haptic feedback which provide an element
of tactile resistance to your thumbs
wherever they go this gives the illusion
of grip and attempts to trick your brain
into thinking you're using a joystick
but with a joystick I can usually hit
targets more than three feet away the
grip buttons on the back of the steam
controller designed to perform key
actions like jump and reload
out happy to take your finger off the
trackpad and while it's a neat idea
I found myself constantly hitting them
by accident when tensing my grip during
a heated firefight
I haven't bunny hopped like that since
counter-strike 1.3 finally the
controller uses two double-a batteries
as opposed to a rechargeable lithium-ion
battery which you'll either love or hate
but you can also power the controller
using a microUSB cable in closing I can
confidently say that the steambox feels
right in between a console and the PC
you get to game in the comfort of your
living room with a controller friendly
UI but you also get to enjoy superior
visuals and play some of your favorite
PC exclusive titles at the same time the
finished product doesn't feel quite as
fluid as a full-fledged console nor is
it as limitless as a traditional PC as
it currently stands I have my doubts
that early steam machine adopters will
be fully satisfied with the number of
shortcomings I've just discussed but as
is the case with new technology only
time will tell if steam can patch up
some of the oversights and their OS and
give gamers a more complete list of
games to choose from but let me know
