another new product this one's from
gigabytes specifically their aura steam
it's the Auris ad to 7 QD that's correct
so consider this sort of a first look
video no actually it's it's like a
second look video because technically
the first time I check this monitor out
was at CES in January which was like a
month ago man time is flying and I was
really impressed by it my first
impressions were super positive
and I was like 71 I want to take a
closer look at it so this this video is
not sponsored I can talk all the crap I
want on this thing I'm not getting paid
a cent they just sent me a unit and I'm
giving you my first impressions second
impressions whatever so on the surface
this is sort of your typical high-end
gaming panel at 599 US dollars it's got
all those high-end specs you're probably
familiar with like well 27-inch 2560 by
1440 IPS 144 hertz one millisecond
response time HDR and free sync
supported and yada yada yada there's
nothing inherently unique about any of
those specs as robust and impressive as
they are there's a bunch of other
offerings at this price or even lower
with all the same specs we're really
sets this monitor apart from the rest is
surprisingly its OSD and all the various
features that are crammed inside of it
so we're gonna be taking a closer look
at that and I'll tell you why exactly
it's special but for now let's talk
about the panel itself apart from
supporting HDR you also get a 95% dcpip
three color gamut which is quite a bit
wider than srgb or Adobe RGB so wider
range of colors that's that's always
good the panel advertises a 10-bit color
depth when in reality it's actually an
8-bit panel using FRC which is a form of
dithering so it kind of switches between
two colors really quickly to trick your
eyes into seeing a third color that's
not really there giving the illusion of
a wider color gamut it's not quite as
good as a native 10 bit panel by any
stretch however it does have a small leg
up over a standard 8 bit panel that
being said if you're just gaming on this
thing or you're doing some light content
creation like you have a youtube channel
or something the color on this panel is
more than adequate I mean that the
colors are really rich and vibrant
everything kind of pops without being
oversaturated however if you're looking
to do more professional work and serious
hardcore color grading
I would probably upgrade to a native
tended panel
very least the screen itself is pretty
matte it's a relatively anti glare which
is great especially if you're a gaming
during the day and you've got like a
window behind you or something like that
the bezels are super thin on three sides
you've also got a nice-looking chin with
some light Oris branding and a power LED
at the bottom which is white tucked away
beneath that is a joystick for
navigating the built-in OSD which as
we'll see in a moment is almost
completely useless behind the panel
you'll see a bunch of RGB lighting
that's on the display itself as well as
the very nice stand I don't know how I
feel about this it looks really good but
it's also behind the monitor why can't
we have more RGB on the front of the
panel I mean obviously that could be
really distracting but just give us the
option to turn it off I just I don't
know how important it is to have RGB
lighting in a place where you can't see
it while you're gaming on the display I
don't know you guys let me know what you
think about that because it looks really
nice you can customize it within the OSD
and things like that but it's just kind
of out of sight out of mind I feel like
some of it is wasted on on my eyes the
monitor stand gives you the full range
of adjustments tilt pan swivel and
rotate up to 90 degrees it's also built
like a tank the actual base is
completely metal you can probably kill
someone with it and the actual spine
while it's plastic for the most part is
still very durable as well there's even
a nice big carrying handle at the top
that seems very rugged and built to last
if you're keen on wall mounting you can
remove the panel from the stand with a
couple quick release latches and
underneath there you'll find some base
amounts there's a nice collection of
ports back here including three USB 3.0
two of which are downstream one is
upstream that upstream will have to be
connected to your PC in order to take
advantage of a lot of the features that
are in the OSD which we'll take a look
at momentarily you've got a single
DisplayPort 1.4 port which is the port
you're gonna have to use if you want to
take advantage of free sync with a
geforce 10 series card or newer as its
not gonna translate over hdmi 2.0 like
it will with an AMD card you've also got
a pair of hdmi 2.0 ports mic and
headphone jacks a Kensington lock and an
AC power plug with an internal power
brick so you don't have the deal or fuss
around with an external power brick so I
think from a hardware perspective the
Auris team has definitely put together a
high-quality and attractive monitor
that's definitely on par in terms of the
looks and feels Department with other
panels in its price range and even some
that are a bit more expensive than it
but that's just the hardware side let's
talk about
software with that OSD now remember
before when I said that the little
joystick here with the built-in OSD was
virtually useless
that's because available for download
with this panel is the OSD sidekick
application it's basically just a piece
of software that runs on your Windows
desktop functions like a regular program
but it allows you to control every
single feature that this panel offers
with a keyboard and mouse this is kind
of the equivalent or at least it brings
me back to when motherboard
manufacturers started going with their
full keyboard and mouse supported uef
eyes when before we just kind of had a
more basic BIOS and just what a what a
game-changer that was I'm getting the
same sort of feeling here and I wouldn't
be surprised of other monitor
manufacturers some point down the line
started following this trend and I hope
they do because it's a lot easier
obviously to navigate with a keyboard
and mouse than it is with any sort of
you know hardware buttons on the monitor
let's just tip of the iceburg though
let's talk about some of the actual
features I don't know where to start so
I'm just gonna start with the black
equalizer the black equalizer basically
lifts up the black levels in a dark
scene so if you happen to be playing a
game with dark scenes for example the
latest Resident Evil 2 remake and you're
scared of the dark perhaps or you want
to be able to see those zombies from a
bit further away down a dark corridor
you can up your black equalizer and
things in the dark will be much easier
to see there's also an aim stabilizer
setting that effectively reduces
ghosting and creates a more perceptibly
smooth image and the way they do that is
kind of like ultra low motion blur where
they sort of flicker the screen in
between frames I haven't used any
technology like this extensively I would
think for me personally it would start
to fatigue my eyes more quickly but I
guess I can't say for sure it also
effectively dims the the overall
brightness of the screen so you might
have to up the brightness within the OSD
to sort of compensate for that with an
OSD sidekick are also a number of game
assist features the first of which is
basically cheating it's a crosshair
overlay so you could be noscope in newbs
you know with an op and csgo and there's
no way for a developer to prevent it
because it's all within the monitors
hardware it's it's basically cheating
I'm still a terrible gamer with it but
I'm sure some people will be able to
exploit it a lot more effectively than I
well they've taken it even further with
letting you customize your own crosshair
so if you wanted to pixel out your
ex-girlfriends face or something like
that that's something you can do it's
2019 screw it there's also a timer and a
counter that you can throw up on the
screen they're both very
basic tools but also incredibly useful
for example if you want to monitor your
ability cooldowns you can throw up a
timer you can customize exactly if you
want it to time up or a countdown
counter can be really useful for
streaming let's say I mean I've done
this in the past where I'm like alright
for every hundred dollars donated to
charity I'll take a shot on stream and
in the past I've used like a third party
software to actually count the number of
shots I've taken for my viewers to see
but this is all just sort of an
integrated solution that makes things
that much more simple you can also
enable display alignment which I'm still
not a hundred percent sure what this is
for
my guess would be if you have multiple
monitors that you're putting
side-by-side or even you know top to
bottom that you can align them more
accurately or precisely but again I have
no idea I mean you've also got picture
in picture picture by picture with a
couple different settings their
dashboard you have a dashboard that's
kind of similar to MSI Afterburner OSD
where it can give you a bunch of
different system diagnostics like your
GPU CPU temperatures frequencies your
frame rate although the FPS counter was
either spitting out the incorrect values
they were like extremely high or it
wasn't working it also hopefully will
fix that in the future patch and it's
worth noting you can move this in any
corner of the screen along with the
counter and the timer and things like
that naturally these are all hot keyable
functions as well so there's a hotkey
tab that lets you pretty much bind
almost any function that the sidekick
features the last feature here is a and
C or active noise-cancelling which
gigabyte actually demoed for me at their
suite I got to try it out firsthand
and it worked really well I was very
impressed actually the way the demo
worked was they had two systems I was
gaming on one and they had a rep gaming
on the other who was supposed to
represent sort of your typical scumbag
gamer in a public server he was mashing
his keyboard really loudly with chaé MX
blue switches he was blaring music on
his speakers while talking into his
headset mic and with a and C enabled on
his system I could only hear his voice
which was pretty crystal clear from what
I could tell I mean it was fairly noisy
in the suite but I could hear him
exactly what he was saying without any
of the ambient noise couldn't hear the
speaker's couldn't hear the keyboard I
was very impressed and I was using a
pair of really crappy earbuds as well
and bear in mind this is all being
processed by the monitor so you're not
wasting any system resources there's
zero overhead here and overall it just
seems like a really useful feature I
could definitely see it as being a nice
value add for streamers who want to give
their viewers the best
possible experience they don't want any
ambient noise coming through there
Stream definitely a nice built-in
feature to have and the app also lets
you choose how aggressive you want the
ANC effect to be while letting you
select how close are far away the
microphone is from your mouth in order
to give you the best possible
performance I really like the approach
that Oris has taken with the OSD on this
display especially it being their first
display like good job you guys knocked
it out of the park that being said it's
still a very early product it's very new
and the firmware updates aren't quite
there yet so there are some issues and I
already mentioned the framerate counter
wasn't really working that's kind of a
minor issue compared to all of the
hotkey problems I've been having so
depending on the game that I'm in the
hotkeys are either limited or they just
flat-out don't work at all and like I
mentioned before a lot of the features
in the OSD are reliant on being bindable
and being able to pull them up at a
moment's notice there's no point in out
tabbing out of your game just to enable
a setting and then all typing back in no
one's gonna do that
so hopefully with a future update I know
gigabyte said that they're currently
working on a new firmware that's
supposed to address all these issues
that'll all be fixed and at that point I
can give my confident recommendation of
this panel so given its price and its
fairly unique feature set I would say
that this monitor doesn't exactly target
your everyday typical gamer but rather a
niche type of gamer that you know wants
a timer and they want a counter and they
want the active noise-cancelling
built-in there's a specific type of
gamer who has been waiting for this
monitor for a long time and I think for
those users the premium here is going to
be well worth it in the long run
assuming that all the various bugs that
I just mentioned get ironed out soon so
that's it guys let me know what you
think about this thing down in the
comments and also which of its various
features do you see yourself utilizing
the most I'm actually kind of curious
what you guys have to say about that
feel free to toss a like on the video
before you go it helps me a lot
and get subscribed to the channel for
more tech stuff coming at you really
soon have a good one guys I will see you
all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
