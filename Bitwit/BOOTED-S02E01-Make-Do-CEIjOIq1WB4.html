I that wasn't the smoothest intro that's
alright what's up guys welcome to booted
we are finally live thank you all and
chat who came early ha ha ha
for being here this is season 2 episode
1 so we are at a completely new season
now this is the the season premiere
actually and last season we we had a
winner because that's usually how the
show works and that winner was Hannah
and just I wanted to quickly recap on
his glory and his masterful victory here
as a season one grand prize winner
he had an H for 40 as did all the other
finalists had a very nice fairly
balanced rig with the z97 system core i5
44:30 and a gtx 960 and those freaking
cable sleeves man those sleeved
extensions I think really really scored
him some points with the audience so
congratulations hon oh I'm very happy
for you man and I'm looking forward to
seeing how you spent that gift card I'm
actually going to try to convince hanno
I'm in the process of convincing him to
record a short 30-second video that we
can maybe see on a future episode here
on season 2 and find out exactly how
he's spending that $500 gift card I
really hope a CPU cooler is involved in
all that but nice to have you you guys
back welcome first-timers as well for
those of you who are new to the show let
me just quickly explain how this whole
thing works so right now we are in week
1 this is the first episode of of this
particular season where we're gonna have
five contestants hop on board and you
guys the live audience are gonna vote on
which four suck the most and that'll
leave that'll leave one PC as today's
finalists who will go on to compete in
round four later this month and then
next week we do the same thing have five
more contestants x-out four of them
another finalist and then week three
same thing
we'll have our third finalist and then
those three finalists will compete in
week four for the grand prize of a $500
gift card in the form of either Steam or
Amazon monies so this
are pretty high yo $500 is definitely
can definitely make an impact on on your
on your system if you're looking to just
upgrade the hardware and you're using
all $500 for that system it can make a
big difference even if you have a
mid-range or a high-end system good
could you know support a second video
card for example or in Hinault's case
hopefully a CPU cooler and maybe an
unlocked processor who knows some
peripherals maybe but why the $500 gift
card is so important on this season is
because this is a budget addition on
booted here so all the contestants
you're about to see today and for the
next two weeks are basically going to be
showing off their very limited budget
rigs that range around the price of
anywhere from five to seven hundred
dollars give or take now obviously that
that can fluctuate based on whether
whether those those contestants bought
the parts new or used if they're a
secondhand or repurposed from other
builds but more or less we're dealing
with very frugal systems this season
which i think is going to be pretty
interesting because the less money you
have to spend on a rig the more creative
you have to get and the more I think
effort it is really to make your system
look good it's easy when you have lots
of dough floating around to you know get
a nice case with good cable management
that sort of thing so it's gonna be
really interesting I think it's gonna be
an exciting season and before we hop
into our first contestant a quick word
from today's sponsor which is once again
let me go ahead and load this up oh I
missed having Paul around he just he
just does everything so fluidly but
we're gonna be talking about fantex
really quick here they've still got
their RGB LED adapter promo going on so
if you guys have a compatible
motherboard that has a built-in RGB
header which is becoming more and more
popular these days along with the fantex
and through case and it's all it's all
listed right here now you can actually
get one of these RGB LED adapters for
free granted if you purchased those of
that motherboard in case before March
1st then you can get one of these bad
boys and this basically just is it's an
adapter that you hook up an RGB LED
strip fantex also sells those you hook
up an RGB strip to your motherboard
directly which is really nice because
you don't have to
you can get powered directly through
your power supply which eliminates any
need for like a molex or a SATA power
connector from your power supply cleans
up cable clutter quite a bit and it
allows you to control that RGB LED strip
within whatever motherboard software is
being offered and this strip is about
it's 24 inches Hey
so plenty of length to route this
adapter behind your motherboard tray and
really start your LED run your strip run
from any point in your case which is
really nice we're also gonna be talking
a little bit about the P 400 in just a
bit but more on that later
so on that note folks I think it's time
that I have a sip of this beer mmm-hmm
that's a pineapple sculpin IPA from
ballast to point this quite delicious
shout out shout out to my wifey to wifey
sauce for picking it up today let's go
ahead and talk about Cameron this is PC
number one from Cameron now despite this
being a super budget rig he still found
the Appropriations to to bust out a
fractal define our v which is a really
nice case it's not super expensive but I
wouldn't call it budget it's just a very
economical chassis for all the features
that it features for lack of a better
phrase and yeah you've also got a CPU
your of course you could really he's got
a CPU Kyle that's that's groundbreaking
he's got an Athlon 64 x2 6400 which I
think pairs pretty nicely with a gtx
750ti that you got in there let's go
ahead and take a closer look here yeah
okay we've got a lot it looks like
there's a lot going on here and I'm glad
you have a case with decent cable
management otherwise would be slightly
worse than it already is I'm in I'll
give you some credit I'll give you some
credit here because you're dealing with
an old-school asus motherboard the m2m e
sli and it's got some weird port layout
configurations here so you've got your
24 pin ATX that's way over here by the
CPU cooler you don't really see that
anymore these days maybe on a few
specialty boards or some server grade
boards but yeah I feel sorry for you man
because that's a really shitty location
for for that
big-ass connector to be but you tried
your best I guess I I think you could
have probably routed it you would have
had better luck routing the cable up you
know kind of behind at the top your case
because there's a routing hole up there
it on the definer v but I also
understand if you didn't have enough
length in that cable for that cable to
reach but considering that you're using
an NZXT Heil 82 550 watt power supply I
think you probably could have managed
speaking of which the cables themselves
are not the greatest they are ketchup
and mustard that's kind of the standard
cabling that comes with the Heil 82 I
believe which is a shame because it's a
nice power supply it's all white that's
not a modification guys if you're
wondering if he painted his power supply
or if he dipped it you know in something
no it's not wrapping paper that is how
the Heil 82 naturally looks so it's kind
of a shame that you've got some ketchup
and mustard cables here docu some points
for that but apart from that you've also
got this IDE cable that's connected to
what I believe is an optical drive up
here that's also running molex power so
you've probably had this thing for quite
some time now and just you just couldn't
get rid of it you just couldn't let it
go could you you know I'm sorry I'm
sorry about that
because it looks hideous I have to say
IDE cables never was a fan never will be
and they're kind of they've gone the way
of the dinosaur for sure so maybe I
don't know optical drives aren't that
expensive you can easily just get a SATA
powered one you know that runs say to
both data and power and really clean up
the look of your system here just by
replacing that god-awful gray flat
ribbon mess but we've also got some
stuff going on here this is a some
memory you've got eight gigs
solid of ddr2 and from a tech no less
and I have not seen any new sticks from
a tech in ages
in fact I don't think I've ever even
seen an a Tech kit in person just online
in the pitches but I believe they still
make memory they I know they make some
ddr3 I don't know if they're making ddr4
if they are there's still a very budget
there on the budget side I don't even
think they actually have heat spreaders
on most of their Dems if any but ddr2 I
mean I'm not gonna dock any points for
that because Steve Eagar too in most
cases when you're gaming is is plenty is
plenty fast even at 800 megahertz I know
it doesn't look great on paper but I've
heard a lot of reports and from people
who are still on ddr2 and said no like
any limitations I have when gaming is
not a fault of my memory it's usually
the CPU or the video card or something
like that so um yeah
what I will say is that it will play
look god-awful obviously their classic
green PCB that nasty green goo just
makes me shudder but uh but yeah let's
see what else you got here let's see
okay so you got an optional shot here
with the with the side panel on nice
little window peering through everything
okay okay now is there anything else I
really want to say about this system I
like the fact that you have a hyper 212
on there even though it doesn't really
need it you know just because it looks a
lot better than the stock AMD cooler
that's for sure and it's a hell of a lot
quieter so I really like how you did
that but yeah and I also like how you
remove the the hard drive cage I think
that was a smart move you weren't
utilizing those five other drive trays
in the define r5 so you just took it out
and opened up a lot more airflow for
your case with that front intake there
so good call on that night good on you
might I wish I wish I was Australian so
I could really Drive that phrase home
but you know the one thing I'll say is
I'm a little conflicted about the define
r5 as well because it's such a nice case
that I'm like I don't want to like give
you shit for it or take off points but
at the same time I feel like that's
probably one of the last components you
should have invested in here especially
with that CPU 750ti I think you're okay
with it as long as you're doing some
light gaming at 1080 but but yeah maybe
maybe a new like chipset and you know
socket type would have been nice maybe
get some ddr3 just to be a little bit
more
then forking out a hundred bucks for
that case at the same time who knows who
knows I might have I might just be
giving you as much shit if you had spent
more money on the chipset but had like
the motherboard and CPU but you had like
this really crappy Zalman case or
something you know really good I don't
know who knows you know there's really
no right or wrong method here I'm just
I'm just spitting just spitting fire no
that's not really fire anyway I don't
know I'm saying now thank you Karen
yeah let's move on to Simon this is also
the crooked picture edition of booted
where all the pictures are crooked I
forgot to mention that so we've got a
Zalman z11 plus a I was just talking
shit on Zelman cases hey that was purely
coincidental man case in here I'm sorry
I didn't mean that maybe I did
who knows I've got an AMD FX 6100 paired
with an ACO something motherboard and
something Ram that's a long long ass
code that I'm not I do not care to
decipher you've also got a ZOTAC gtx 615
here
let's take a look ok so right off the
bat way better cable management than
Cameron I would say much cleaner all
around and and granted you don't have
like the best case for cable management
but you seem to make do here just fine I
think maybe things could have been
tightened up a little bit more at the
power supply you've got a stock AMD
cooler so there's that you've also got a
brown PCB on your motherboard which I'm
not a huge fan of but I understand given
the price range of all of these builds
that you do what you can
the other thing here is that you very
much like Cameron also have some nasty
green PCB naked you got some naked dims
in them slaps there and you didn't say
how much capacity was there but I'm
guessing it's either four or eight
that have to imagine it's at least four
especially if you're doing some some
light gaming even but the pairing here
is is also pretty nice I like your
hardware style you've got a like I said
the I think the CPU matches the GPU I
don't think you're gonna see too many
bottlenecks there the other thing that I
am a little bit skeptical about Oh
here's here's some here's some bling if
you want to call that bling there's some
blue LEDs in here so you got a little
bit of illumination and I like I like
that I like how even though this is a
cheap cheapo rig
you've still managed to get some some
blue accent LEDs in there to match your
motherboard which is cool and we can't
really see the dims so that's a plus
however I did want to point out that
your power supply is scaring me one
because I don't really know anything
about this brand power LC or LC power
I'm not sure which way it goes but it
looks a little bit shady to me that's
all I'm gonna say there's no sticker on
it I don't know if you remove the
sticker or if it's just that budget of a
power supply that it doesn't have one on
it because some of them don't which is
also kind of surprising because you've
got you know flat black ribbon style
cables that that seem to come stock on
this thing
I can't imagine you swap those out so I
don't know I'm a bit perplexed I
definitely know this power supply is not
80-plus I mean correct me if I'm wrong
in chat but that looks that that looks
sketchy
so that's points for that power supply
because even these days I think you can
get a decent power supply that's you
know 40 50 bucks
definitely enough power for that GTX 650
what is a 650 these days I mean these
days it's got a TVP of what like 60 64
65 watts so yeah I don't know I don't
know that power supply man but overall
everything else looks pretty good
so nice job Simon not bad I'll to Chevy
let's move on to Kareem Kareem is PC
number three numero thais you've got a
Corsair 88 are
mmm-hmm it's actually a pretty decent
budget case so nice taste I like your
style on that I've also got an Intel
Pentium G 32:58
which obviously we're gonna see a bunch
of these processors surface on this
season of booted eventually because it's
it's it's a good chip for the money
it's overclockable it is dual-core but
you can't overclock the sucker and it is
affordable so we've got that paired with
a B 85 M motherboard from asrock eight
gigs of HyperX fury 1866 can you
overclock on b85 I'm honestly guys I'll
be honest I'm not too familiar with b5
but I don't know if you can like
overclock the multiplier you can't
change the multiplier right I know I
mean you can probably change the B clock
but let me know in chat you've also got
an r7 370 in here okay that I think
that's a pretty decent budget card
especially pairing it with that Pentium
chip we've also got a 500 gig Samsung
hard drive and you didn't specify
whether it was oh yeah I guess you
didn't specify that it was a hard drive
another SSD and actually I can see it
right here now if I'm looking if I'm
using my eyes like I do cable management
is actually not horrible it could be
cleaned up a little bit what stands out
to me is okay so you can you you can
overclock on it or you used to be able
to okay
or or yes you can so some b85
motherboards can overclock thank you
guys for clearing that up I should I
should just do a bunch of b85
motherboard reviews to brush up on my on
my knowledge there but okay so the
cables that are underneath your hard
drive are staring at me a little bit and
I wish that I couldn't see them also
ketchup and mustard ketchup and mustard
everywhere Intel stock cooler is just
problems problems all the time at least
I would have taken the stickers off my
power supply to you know maybe make
things a little bit more flush
the rest of the system and if we take a
look at the money shot here you also
have your little blue cover on your SLI
bridge our I'm sorry your crossfire
bridge this is a Radeon card an AMD card
I would probably take that off buddy I
don't think you really need that there I
think that's just how the packaging
comes it's kind of like leaving the
plastic wrapper on your on your card but
you can remove that it also doesn't
really look that great so mm-hmm
the other thing let's see can we show
this
all right here's just another angle and
yeah I mean honestly your cable
management is good given your case and
there's really not much other than the
your SATA connectors there by the hard
drive you've also got plenty of airflow
which I like you know you got some
cheapy fans at the front there but they
are probably moving some air towards
your video card granted it probably
doesn't get too hot anyway cuz it's you
know low TDP and that sort of thing
but I think this is a pretty nice so far
this is my favorite rig in terms of
hardware like if I just was choosing
ranking the system's based on hardware I
might go for this one
you also got some ddr3 1866 RAM in there
so that's nice so good job cream we will
see what the audience thinks about your
little system here and we've still got
two more to go though guys we've got
manual I don't know if it's manual or
manual or manual I have a friend whose
name is manual but I know some manuals
pronounce their name manual I don't know
maybe it depends on which country you're
in I'm not that cultured so we've got a
lodge assist 368 so ho is that really
what it's called a SOHO it's kind of
funny like South Hollywood you know is
it is it like a preppy case look at
hipster douche bag chassis anyway you've
got an AMD a8 3850 say pay off a soos f1
a 55m le I have no experience with this
motherboard eight gigs of Myshkin EC
zero to sixteen hundred
that's that's looking pretty good what's
got in our nine 270x they're from our
friends over at XFX let's take a look
here okay now the first thing I see and
by the way I'm not a huge fan of the
case this is a preference thing this is
completely subjective it looks it looks
like a transformer toy knockoff that you
would buy at a swap meet you know it's
not really transformers it's like
transform transform arrows and they're
like they look a little different anyway
personal preference side profile now at
first I was like what is a curly fry
doing in your system and then I realized
that's not a curly fry that is a fan
cable up here by your CPU cooler it's
actually the fan cable from your rear
exhaust fan and I don't know if you just
if it I I don't know I have no comment
did you take it to get a perm did they
come like that sometimes I haven't dealt
with a fan cable personally pet look
like that from the get-go but fulle
distracting and while it's not a french
fry
there is definitely ketchup on it and
I'm not a fan of that either plenty of
ketchup in this system along with
mustard yes noodle cables that's right
so yeah obviously there's not too much
to do with cable management here there
isn't much flexibility that you have in
this largest case I've only dealt with
one largest this case in my life and it
was actually the the video was the
chiefest building the cheapest PC ever
it was like 140 dollar PC and it came
with a power supply which I believe this
chassis also did and this is another
questionable power supply and guys
doesn't matter if you're running like
really low powered components like a 270
X for example get a good power supply
because the power supply is the one
thing where if it goes bad and and
shit goes south your other components
are really in danger as well because the
power supply obviously powers everything
words of wisdom
so that's a little sketchy to me however
I like the video card choice I think it
is probably the best looking thing in
this system by far motherboard at least
you have some heat spreaders on your
dims I mean I got a fault the other guys
for for just sticking with the nasty
green stuff but have fan cable though
fan cable though man I don't know if you
just like if you took like scissors and
you went like you how you deal with
ribbon like when you're when I'm
wrapping presents and you want to make
the ribbons all curly I bet you did that
I bet you did that didn't you anyway oh
I don't want to show the cable
management quite yet it's not time for
that yet okay so manual manual there's
definitely room for improvement here but
aesthetics aside this looks like a very
functional system and I'm sure you get
some good gaming mileage out of it so
I'm happy for you as long as your power
supply doesn't explode in the next 24
hours on that notes
here's Riker Riker I like your name you
probably have the best name so far on
booted out of all the contestants apart
from hano hano is also a pretty cool
name I'll tell you Europeans
it's either Europeans are like white
kids with rich parents that get all
funky with their kids names anyway
the corsair speck zero 3 and this is
kind of interesting this is a very
interesting system here let's take a
look at the side profile we've got a G
32 58 once again cooled by a cryo rig h7
azrog z97 pro 3 and a gtx 750ti from
EVGA eight gigs of kingston valueram 120
gig SSD this is the first I believe the
first SSD that we've seen in the budget
system rankings which is good good on
you mate and you've also got three hard
drives in there I'm sure you didn't buy
all these at the same time maybe they
were left over from other builds or from
you know just just something else
external drives maybe now the first
thing it's this always this always
amuses me because people will go the
extra mile to cover up a certain part of
their system say for example the power
supply area they'll go out of their way
like Ryker did to create kind of a
diversion or a power supply shroud for
example and instead of like drawing
attention away from that area it really
just draws my attention to it it seems
counterintuitive to me and really
defeats the purpose because it just
looks like you took a shoebox and cut a
big hole in it and slapped it right over
that part of your case granted at least
you put gaff tape over the shoe box
before you installed it a but still it
just looks really distracting and I
guess maybe when you have the side panel
on it doesn't matter so much but at
least from this angle kind of kind of
pulls me out of it just a tad and I can
also see you've done the same thing with
your 24 pen at least and and your other
cables your other cables your 24 pin ATX
and maybe even some SATA cables over
there are also wrapped in gaff tape
I like I like your forward way of
thinking Riker
you can definitely see that as gaff tape
gaff tape confirmed and from afar you
can't really tell maybe you can maybe in
person you can but how about that Linus
tech tips fan a you notice I said a
because - is Canadian yeah here's here's
my problem with the lens tech tips man
apart from the fact that it's from Linus
no actually that has nothing to do with
it at all
but it's a knock to a fan right at its
core it's just a rebranded nock to a fan
that's like what 25 30 bucks after tax
and shipping maybe 35 bucks that I don't
know maybe could have been put towards a
better case that maybe had a power
supply shroud that would have looked a
lot better than what you did here and
also it doesn't really match the stock
fan that came with that that h7 there so
you've got two different fans on that
cooler which also looks a little bit
strange obviously that doesn't mean you
should go out and buy another Linus fan
I mean you can but like I said I think
your money is better spent elsewhere on
components you really need so I don't
really know if that's gonna get you that
much more cooling performance slap at
another fan on there even if it is not
to a
but um but you know what I will say
Riker is I like the effort you put in
more effort or more time was spent with
this build than anyone else and you
definitely have the best cooler - tech
tips or not and we've did we take a look
at the front here we're starting to
piece together some of the puzzle
putting the pieces together you named
this system trash 5000
it's either the five trash five thousand
the trash s is zero zero but I'm pretty
sure it's five thousand so that makes a
little bit more sense so maybe this is
kind of the the vibe you were going for
was kind of more like a makeshift
homemade home modification you know
amateur type look what I think is you
you did the gaff tape you did the the
power supply shroud and the cables first
and you you you knew you knew that it
kind of looked a little off so you
decided to stamp the trash logo on there
to make it a bit more befitting which
you know good on you mate again only I
was Australian yeah man I definitely can
see the effort that you put into into
this and like I said the name of this
episode is make - and you got to make do
with what you have so I can respect that
I definitely respect that but those
ladies and gentlemen are all the
contestants for season 2 episode 1 so
right about now you should be seeing in
chat my lovely beautiful wife posting
some links so she'll be posting two
links one is a photo album photo albums
of all the contestants we just saw and
you can go ahead and open that and take
a look at all the full full size images
of each rig and look at them carefully
guys don't just you know just go based
off of impulse really take a look and
see which ones stand out to you the most
and are overall the better build and
then the other link she'll be posting in
chat is a straw poll link to vote on
which of those systems you think should
go on to week 4 as a
finalist and win all the money's so what
you guys are doing that and I want you
guys to again take your time we're gonna
go ahead and take a look at our sponsor
one more time fantex with the Eclipse
p400 damn Daniel I'm sorry
sorry back at it again with the white no
I'm sorry I can't help it I can't help
it it's over it's it's been dead a long
time anyway it Clips p400 budget case
sixty seventy bucks for this thing
really great water cooling support if
you're trying to get into that you're
trying to break into water cooling but
you don't want to spend a hundred bucks
on a case this is this is a pretty nice
case and and you have a really large
side panel window which i think is I'm
really glad that that's starting to
trend more and more even on budget cases
at this price point because especially
if there's water cooling support you're
gonna want to show off those components
generally speaking the water cooling
stuff looks is designed and you pay a
little bit more for it because of the
cool factor because manufacturers
purposely make them look as cool as they
can its its popularity contest it's a
cool thing so it's nice to be able to
see those components in this chassis
you've also got some accent LED lighting
here at the bottom and that does
correlate to the
any RGB strip that you connect I believe
actually it might just be the fantex
ones I'm not too sure about that but for
sure the fantex RGB LEDs if you connect
it to let's say a motherboard like the
Maximus 8 formula then you can actually
sync both of those colors and anytime
you change in the software it will it
will go ahead and update both of those
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure correct
me if I'm wrong guys but that's from
from what I've heard what
there's no photos for number one oh
there's no photos for number one all
right guys since there are no photos for
number one I will just go ahead and show
them to you I'm sorry about that
I will I will fire my QA assistant
effective immediately
oh wait I'm the QA assistant I'm sorry
I'm firing myself immediately
okay so here's number one this is a
number one Cameron go ahead and take a
look he was in the define our five boom
and there's another side profile shot
that IDE cable in a tu camera get at it
yeah alright there's another close-up
look all righty then
alrighty I think that's that's fair okay
you guys got some coverage you can
always pause the video if you really
need to but yeah also wonder really
quickly speaking of the the p400 check
out this awesome video that I made no
actually this is hardware connects this
is Dimitri
this is Dimitri filmography goddess yes
he's a goddess he's just dainty like
that but he did a review on the P 400
new 69 Hey
case Dubai $69 that's USD by the way and
he had some nice things to say about it
as well maybe just look at it doesn't
really look like a $69 case I'm you know
I mean the front is plastic and it's
very minimal but when you look at the
internal layout it actually does have a
lot of features that you might see on a
more expensive chassis do that radiator
support has radio support at the top and
the front of the case guys so you can
fit multiple rads in there and not just
like 120 s you can fit you know - 40 s -
80 s there's the LED functionality so
just wanted to give a quick shout out to
my homie dimitri go ahead and check out
his review if you haven't already and
yeah p400 baby I'm actually getting fan
texts to send me one for review so I can
check it out myself because the last
time I took a look at it the only time I
took a look at it in person with CES on
that note y'all I think it's time that
we we take a look at the voting stuff I
always get nervous I always get nervous
about the voting stuff and if you guys
want to be surprised don't look at the
results just yet
because that ruins it for everyone
okay ooh okay there we go
I got a Q that I got a cue the a
dramatic music here all right
all right you guys you guys voted we all
looked we all looked and this dramatic
music really doesn't do well when
there's like a banquet advertisement
right here and one for whatever let's
see who won boom all right
number five hey actually Riker Riker you
son of a gun you got 51% of the votes
dude not bad so that means you are our
week one finalist my friend your shoddy
power supply shroud job actually won
this round that is phenomenal and like I
said a plus a plus plus for effort man
you really showed everyone what you
could do with what you had and it really
paid off in the end so we will be seeing
you my friend and and your trash 5000
here back again in week four so very
nice very nice and for all you other
guys thank you very much for competing

things like that we have 5 Mondays or
nobody helped we only live we only allow
we only have 4 Mondays this month so
there will be a booted episode every
single Monday of this month unlike last
month where we had to skip last week so
that's cool also if you guys were
curious to enter booted you wanted to
enter hold that thought because I might
be drafting up a more easily follow a
bull a better how to enter video because
based on the submissions that I've been
getting either I'm not clear enough with
my how to enter video or you guys are
just special because um it's not cutting
it right now so I'm gonna try to go back
to the drawing board draft up a really
simple and easy to understand how to
enter video and once that's up I'll be
announcing when submissions reopen for
season 3 and I'll also be announcing the
theme for season 3 as well so stay tuned
for that guys if you're watching this
either live or rebroadcast go ahead and
toss me a like on the video if you

free to dislike it now I really sound
like Linus but and also leave me some
