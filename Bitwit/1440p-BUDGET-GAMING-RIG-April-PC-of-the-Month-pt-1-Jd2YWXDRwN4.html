a brutal man I don't know something
snapped off and it's just hurting yikes
sorry about that
hey you know some dogs sort of look like
their owners what a Pacemakers share the
same traits as their cases
that's ridiculous no it kind of works
right I mean because like the peer-based
600 is cool right and you're arguably
cool right the case is super quiet and
you've always been on the soft-spoken
side yeah think it's totally true
actually there's one more thing we have
in common what's that well after the
colonoscopy I think girls or
supportively 16-millimeter radiator that
like include push-pull or the pure base
604 be quiet offers a tempered glass
side panel sound damping material and a
highly versatile design chips with a
pair of powerful peer wings two fans and
intentional support for 360 radiators

more info what's cracking people welcome
back to the channel hope you're all
doing well today I'll be assembling
April's PC of the month sorry I'm a
little bit late on this but it should be
a pretty killer system we've got an
eight hundred and fifty dollar budget
risin v gaming PC I guess it could also
be a streaming PC or really you could
use it for anything that the hardware
will allow which as you're about to see
is quite a bit I'm pretty stoked about
the price point today I think staying
well under a thousand bucks puts this
rig well within reach for a lot of us
budget gamers and builders out there of
course if you were looking for something
a bit more high-end go ahead and check
out the recent rising bill that I did
including a gtx 1080p eye and an 1800 x
but on that note slate and gentlemen
let's go ahead and take a look at the
parts will be using for today's build
all right look at this i'm on a tripod
today really moving on up in the world
getting fancy figured you guys would
appreciate it want it to be with my
shakey cam chronicles like you usually
do but let's take a look first at our
cpu here and there was a lot of debates
and internal struggle that i was dealing
with when choosing horizon parts and
eventually i settled on this Rison v
1600 i almost went with the 1600 x but i
figured this is the better value
considering our tight budget honestly
you're still getting six cores 12 thread
it's going to be great for for
multi-threaded applications of course
as well as gaming especially since I'm
targeting this build to to really gain
and shine best at 2560 by 1440 you can
definitely get away with that we'll talk
more about that later but I think the
1600 is is a good call it's a 65 watt
TDP part so we don't really need too
much cooling power and with the included
race spire which you can check out my
full review of in the top right corner
of the screen if you haven't seen that
yet I think we're going to be saving
quite a bit of cash this way so that we
can actually dump it into other more
important parts in our computer but I
think it's also going to overclock
fairly well on our motherboard here
which is the Asus Prime let me go ahead
and move this guy out of the way
the ACS Prime be 350 plus I've actually
been using this board quite a bit
ever since the launch of Verizon mainly
just for testing and stuff and I've
actually really liked it so far
it overclocks well enough and just as
well as like an X 370 board or at least
the ones that I've tried it with and the
memory compatibility is actually pretty
solid ever since ASA started rolling out
those BIOS updates we've been able to
hit some nice 3200 mega Hertz on on
various kits including this Ripjaws v 16
gigabyte kit this is g.skill memory and
it's totally good stuff ddr4 3200
megahertz so we're going to be running
it at that rated speed which I'm very
confident that we can hit no problem and
we've also got a 1 terabyte Seagate
Barracuda for our only storage drive I
know you guys are going to kill me Kyle
how could you not include an SSD in this
build I can already feel the riots
brewing in the comments but guys with
850 bucks to spare I really wanted to
squeeze every last ounce of performance
out of our our gaming PC here which
really I had to tribute that money or
distribute that money to to like a CPU
the video card and I didn't really want
to cut corners in those areas so what it
ended up what ended up happening was I
cut corners with our storage but that's
ok I think because an SSD is super easy
to upgrade later down the line if you
just want to drop one in and migrate
your OS and other applications on to it
should be pretty pretty pretty
straightforward but I will say if you
guys are building something similar to
the build that you see here and you have
an extra you know hundred bucks or so to
spare I would highly recommend getting
an SSD in the 250 gig capacity for your
operating system because it will in fact
make
your system run a bit zippier actually
much zippier but for the purpose of
today's video I think the 7200 rpm
mechanical will do the job just fine for
now moving on to our power supply we've
got a 550 watts EVGA units this is just
a very generic sort of budget oriented
power supply here and I actually thought
when I purchased it that it was 80 plus
certified at least 80 plus bronze it's
not there's no 80 plus rating on it
which is kind of strange but I'm still
fairly confident that it should be okay
for our needs so I mean you can expect
maybe 75% or so efficiency as opposed to
80 plus see what I did there but
honestly we've got a low tbp part here
for our CPU even if we overclock it I
think that's not going to draw too much
power at all and we've also got a fairly
power efficient video card here from AMD
the brand new rx 580 this in particular
is the power color red devil comes
factory overclocked with a bit more
headroom but the RX 580 which just
launched but from AMD not too long ago
is quite a bit more power efficient as
well then the R X 480 even though it's
using the same Polaris 10 GPU in there
we should be able to get away with you
know an on 80 plus certified to power
supply at least I would hope for hope so
hopefully this bill doesn't melt or
incinerate by the end of it all let me
go ahead and adjust the camera angle
shaky cam chronicles are back again whoo
and finally we've got our case of the
hour this is the spec alpha from Corsair
as part of the carbide series it's only
about 75 80 bucks a super budget
oriented case great for a build like
this and a lot of you guys have actually
been requesting that I do a build in
this chassis which I was like wow yeah
there's enough requests for then I will
so here it is this is going to be my
first time building in it personally so
I've I'm not sure what to expect I
haven't really seen a full review of it
yet it's been more or less well received
from what I understand but it's always
different and nice to just experience it
yourself firsthand so looking forward to
building in this sucker today hopefully
it doesn't give me too many problems but
those my friends are all the parts for
today's build overall I'm very excited
to put it together I think the end
result is going to be glorious so let's
go ahead and kick it off to a quick
time-lapse and get to building
but
okay guys here's the finished build and
she's looking pretty good actually for
the budget we had to work with I'm
pretty impressed how we were able to
color match as well as we did there's
really no color clashing drama going on
apart from maybe the green sticker on
the hard drive but fortunately that's
tucked away in the drive cage so you
can't really see it too much you guys
may have noticed that I peel the sticker
off of the power supply during the time
lapse only to reveal a manufacturing
flaw underneath which is kind of a
bummer it looks like some sort of
blemish or or paint got on there before
they put the sticker on whatever it's
just a cosmetic affair no big deal
cable management in the spec alpha
wasn't terrible it wasn't great either
at first I thought it was going to be
really rough because there's hardly any
room from first glance behind the
motherboard tray and then you realize
quickly that the the backside panel
actually is indented so it does give you
some extra space there but sort of
minimal with the tie-down points I wish
there was a few more of those and the
included zip ties with this case are
just just too short they're way too
shorts of course they're maybe make them
a little bit longer for next time
one thing I ought to mention is that
there's actually no cable routing hole
near the 8 pin CPU connector so that
means I had to route the cable all the
way across the vrm across the entire
motherboard and through the same hole
that I routed the 24 pin ATX cable which
kind of looks a bit silly fortunately
but the power supply cables are black
but if they weren't God that would
though just look horrendous so also
something to be aware of if you're going
to be going this route with this case
there's also you know you can sort of
see the the cables coming through the
the right side of the motherboard tray
there so it doesn't look the cleanest I
could have spent a bit more time tidying
that up and making sure that they're not
visible from this side of the case but
that's at a time that I didn't really
want to spend over although I'm pretty
happy with how this turned out I kind of
like how the fans are and you know have
red LEDs them it sort of illuminates
just the right side of the case just a
bit gives us a bit of glow without
having to buy some LEDs but overall very
happy with how this turned out stay
tuned for part two where we do a full
analysis we do all the
benchmarks overclocking acoustics and
thermals and that sort of thing so it
should be very fun but guys let me know
what you think of this build eight
hundred and fifty bucks
we can I know for sure we can definitely
do 2560 by 1440 gaming with the majority
of titles at pretty decent settings but
let me know what you guys think if this
is a good value if you like the parts
