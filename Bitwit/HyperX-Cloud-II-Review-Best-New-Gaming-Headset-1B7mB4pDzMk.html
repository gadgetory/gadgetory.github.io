the channel today I am reviewing a brand
spankin new gaming headset that just
launched today unless you're watching
this video on a different day that isn't
this one this is the HyperX cloud 2
successor to the original cloud had said
which became widely popular among gamers
for its affordability comfort and
quality now you can still buy the
original cloud for just 80 bucks but
you'll have to shell out an even $100
for the cloud too so why the extra $20
well design wise the headphones
themselves look near identical to their
original and this is a good thing
matte black plastic ear cups with
brushed aluminum side panels a sturdy
metallic frame with easy adjustment for
head size and a padded headband with
high quality stitching accompanied by an
embroidered HyperX logo I was happy to
see good flexibility in the headband as
well as just the right amount of
clamping force that in tandem with the
super lightweight of just 350 grams
makes this headset wearable for hours on
end without any discomfort you might
even say that it feels like a cloud on
your head oh that's why they call it
that it comes with pre-installed
around-the-ear leatherette memory foam
pads which feel good but they've also
included a pair of velour pads as a
comfy alternative the boompole
microphone is flexible for optimal mic
placement and lets you know when your
headset is happy to see you
it features a foam windscreen on the end
to eliminate air pops and of course is
detachable so you can use the headphones
in public without looking like this guy
to test the sound and noise isolation of
the microphone I wired the headset
directly into the rear panel onboard
audio of my motherboard and recorded in
both silent and noisy environments check
it out check one two
hello everyone this is a sound test
using the HyperX cloud 2 gaming headset
in a silent room with no ambient noise
whatsoever unless the stupid dog starts
barking outside then I'm going to kill
it
stupid dog alright this is the second
test I now have the the AC running
little window AC unit in my room on full
blast as well as typing on these Cherry
MX switches on like k70 RGB
hello my name is Kyle and this is a test
with a keyboard so while the mic sounds
a bit tinny it's decent enough for a
gaming headset but it still did pick up
a good chunk of noise from the red
Cherry MX switches on my k70 RGB despite
the mics cardioid pattern in the
microphones defense however it did do a
nice job of leaving out the noise of my
AC unit as well as the screams coming
from my face shifting back to the
headset a nice improvement over the
original cloud is that the chord
solution has been simplified into a
single four conductor jack to carry both
the mic and audio signals as opposed to
having them split into two separate
connections not only does this mean less
cable mess behind your computer but it
creates a more viable solution for
on-the-go use when a microphone isn't
needed the braided cable exits out the
left ear cup and measures one meter long
which I found to be the perfect length
from my head to my pocket when using the
product with a smartphone apart from
that the specifications on this headset
haven't changed much either as you still
get 53 millimeter drivers and 60 ohms of
impedance for clean sounding audio even
at max volume the bass manages to bring
tons of body without overwhelming the
fearless mids and highs and I found a
pleasurable listening experience with
just about every genre of music except
for country which I've now learned
sounds bad through any pair of
headphones I was also impressed by the
sound isolation and insulation
when using the leather at ear cups which
is partially attributed to the
headphones closed-back design the velour
pads perform adequately in this arena as
well but I definitely choose the
leatherette pads when traveling in noisy
crowded areas like a subway or a subway
and that brings us to the main feature
that separates the cloud 2 from its
predecessor the included 2 metre USB
dongle with built-in sound card and
audio control unit but the dongle
plugged into your computer and your
headphones plugged into the control unit
you get access to volume up and down
buttons for your mic and headphone
though I found these buttons far too
stiff to press quickly without some
directed focus a minor annoyance when
changing volume on-the-fly when gaming
on the left side you do get a microphone
mute switch and a shirt clip on the back
but the real star of the show here is
definitely support for 7.1 channel audio
one press of the center button enables a
virtual 7.1 surround sound which I found
to be good for watching movies and
playing certain games like FPS shooters
and survival horror you'll definitely
notice a much
weiter sound stage with 7.1 enabled
which helps you pinpoint specific audio
sources around you naturally this helps
you pick up on things like which
direction someone's running from the
sound of their footsteps or where an
enemy might be lurking based on the
sound of their gunfire while this
virtualized element of depth makes for a
much more immersive experience all
around it's also the focal point when it
comes to deciding whether or not to buy
this headset there's no doubt that
HyperX and co-developer cue pad have
upheld their standard of high quality
and comfort with the cloud to's but at
just 80 bucks the tried-and-true Cloud
headset makes them a tough sell unless
you deem the extra 20 bucks worthy of
getting 7.1 channel surround sure you
also get that single consolidated audio
jack which is actually a great
improvement if you plan on using these
as headphones on the go but for most of
us it's a feature we drop in a heartbeat
if it meant a $20 price cut if I'm
speaking honestly here I can't say that
upgrading from a cloud 1 to a cloud 2 is
a worthy investment with today's current
pricing on the other hand if your
current headsets days are numbered and
you're looking for a 7.1 channel
solution that also works perfectly for
on-the-go environments the cloud 2 is a
quality product that's sure to serve you
well for years to come at any rate let
me know what you guys think of this
headset in the comments below or more
specifically what your take is on 7.1
channel audio does it take your gaming
experience to the mix of them or do you
prefer the unaltered sound of
two-channel stereo as always guys toss
me a like on this video if you enjoyed
it before you guys go and check the
description below for ways you can help
support the channel like bookmarking my
