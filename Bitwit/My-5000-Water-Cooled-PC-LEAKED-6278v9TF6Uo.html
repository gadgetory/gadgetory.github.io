the description to catch this exciting
drop before it ends
so those of you who follow me on social
media are probably well aware by now
that hotline my custom water cooled PC
my one true love part of my wife
suffered a catastrophic leak recently
and it's the biggest leak in any custom
water-cooled system I've ever built I'm
still a little shaken up by the whole
thing but today I'm going to just sort
of give you guys a really quick update
of what happened why it happened and
where do we go from here so it was
Friday last Friday and I came home I was
out all day came home didn't go to my
office right away
I just sort of hung out in the living
room for a bit and then finally right
before I went to bed went to the office
just to check on some stuff and saw this
huge puddle of pink fluid on the carpet
floor at that point I immediately knew
because it was coming from just below
hotline obviously I knew what had
happened I looked up and there was fluid
everywhere I was expecting maybe just
like one leak from some specific point
that had just kind of made its way to
the carpet no it was everywhere and as
you guys could tell from the b-roll
footage it it definitely was a nightmare
so I immediately turn the system off
because it was running when I found it
and actually it was running seemingly
fine it was in the windows lock screen
and there was no nothing weird that
would indicate a system the hardware was
malfunctioning on screen but I
immediately pulled the plug shut it down
before it could do any serious damage
and I cried I cried myself to sleep
no I didn't cry but I did take it to the
office here in the studio the next day
for further inspection and what I found
is that this fitting right here
on top of the terminal was actually
loose it was far too loose so much to
the point where this tube right here was
actually kind of half in and half out so
it was sort of making you know semi
contact with its oring when it should
have been completely immersed into it
and and that explains why it was just
spraying out so violently in every
direction and you know in light of all
this as traumatic as this was there are
a couple things in hindsight that I'm
grateful for for one the GPU back plates
were actually helping to cover up the
PCBs and sort of protecting them even
though that's not at all what they're
intended for advertised to do they do
provide some some nice coverage over the
PCBs so fluid was actually going on to
those rather than the card itself which
was hopefully is gonna prove helpful and
we when we test this later on and
secondly the the thermal armor on our
x99 saber tooth board here from Asus
definitely helped protect some crucial
elements on the motherboard like the vrm
area and other various parts and
component rhe so I don't know I haven't
turned the system on since that incident
and I guess the next plan of attack here
is to disassemble everything make sure
it's cleaned to a tee reassemble the
system refill the loop boot it back up
and see if we've suffered any casualties
I'll also be taking a look at thermals
to make sure that everything is
functioning properly but that's pretty
much what's going on with hot line guys
and for those of you who don't know
maybe you're new to the channel you've
never seen the system here before this
computer means a lot to me it was my
very first custom water-cooled PC that I
built a few years back and it was a huge
labor of love so it's very sentimental
to me and I really hope that it makes it
out alive and well I'm sure your
thoughts and prayers are with us both
but I guess I'll close this video out
with the final announcement and I guess
this is kind of a big one as traumatic
as this experience was it has kind of
prompted me to start planning out a
hotline 2.0 build I'm not saying that
this one's going anywhere if I can
restore it back to 100% then it will
continue living doing whatever it needs
to do but I'm gonna start planning out a
new and improved system based on hotline
that is using courage and hardware and
you guys have been requesting this so
much for so long and
this is finally the straw that broke the
camel's back
so um game on and that's all for now
guys so that's all I got to say so thank
you very much for tuning in to this very
brief update and announcement more to
come very soon I'll keep you guys posted
on this guy as well so thanks for
watching
toss a like subscribe and all that I'll
see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
