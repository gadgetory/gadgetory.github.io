my haswell-e build series now this is a
three part video series the first one
being an overview of all the parts I'll
be using for this rig and the second
video you'll enjoy a sexy time-lapse of
me putting it all together and we'll
finish with part 3 where I'll show you
some benchmarks of this system and how
it stacks up against my current Sandy
Bridge z97 rig if you're watching this
video right now it means Intel's latest
enthusiast grade cpufamily haswell-e is
already available to the public and
since I'm now just starting to feel the
sluggish render times with my trusty
desktop that I built back in 2011 I
thought this would be a great
opportunity to build a haswell-e system
as my new editing rig at home now as
most of you know haswell-e marks the
start of a whole new platform that
brings some major hardware improvements
like Intel's x99 chipset and the
long-awaited ddr4 memory form factor and
while these are all very exciting
changes being brought to the table at
the same time nonetheless chances are
there's already an abundance of
information on the interwebs about these
different technologies so I'm gonna keep
this video focused on the computer build
itself if you want to binge on some
detailed specs about haswell-e x99 or
ddr4 you can check out paul's channel so
he can open your mind and fill it with
wisdom alright enough of me talking
let's check out the parts for this build
while I talk some more first off we have
Intel's flagship 8 core destroyer the
core i7 59 60 X which retails for just
over a cool grand now I'll tell you
right now I didn't drop $1,000 on a CPU
this is actually a hardware sample I'm
borrowing until I pull the trigger on
the more affordable 59 30k which only
supports six cores but will still do
wonders for my day-to-day workload it
would have been nice to have all the
parts I actually plan on using regularly
but I suppose the upside to this is that
I'll have more CPU benchmarks to show
you guys in the future my motherboard of
choice is the gigabyte x99 gaming g1
Wi-Fi it has a ton of features like
built-in Wi-Fi obviously an m2 slot for
PCIe slots switchable op amps voltage
read points an LED rear i/o panel the
list just goes on and of course we're
getting quad channel memory support and
10 6 gigabit per second set of 3 ports
courtesy of the x99 chipset I do want to
quickly mention that all the new x99
boards that are currently available use
an LGA 2011 - 3 socket which is not
compatible with former
CPUs like Ivy bridge-e for example so
far these specs and build quality of
this board look very promising and I
can't wait to take advantage of all the
robust features it offers for memory
I've chosen a four by four quad channel
kits from g.skill this is the rip John's
four series clocked at twenty six sixty
six megahertz
now while ddr4 is eventually expected to
reach speeds up to four thousand
megahertz these higher speed modules get
exponentially more expensive so keeping
my budget in mind this is a kid I can
realistically afford if I want to
upgrade to 32 gigs in the future and
let's not downplay the fact that 2666 is
still sufficiently fast for my needs
by the way bonus points the G skill for
designing some sweet looking heat
spreaders just look at those things oh
yeah
the video card for this build is the
only other component on this list that's
temporarily on loan with Maxwell just
around the corner I didn't really want
to buy a 700 series card but since I am
planning on buying either a gtx 8 70 or
80 when it arrives I figured I'd use
this asus rog matrix gtx 780 Ti as a
placeholder till then no big deal since
there will probably be a lot of heat
traps near the CPU between those memory
modules I decided to go with a liquid
cooling solution as a water block seems
to be the most effective way of
immediately removing that heat from the
CPU and dissipating it through a
radiator for this task I've elected
Corsairs H 100 I now I do have some
drives lying around that I like to keep
on hand as coasters so I thought I'd put
them to better use in this system for a
boot drive I'll be using a 256 gig
Plextor
m5 Pro and I'll also be setting up to 2
terabyte hard drives and raid 1 for all
of my awesomesauce network archives one
is a WD black and the other is a Toshiba
drive that used to be in an external
enclosure until I tore it to pieces
these are the drives I'll be capturing
too after finishing up each video shoot
once I'm done capturing and ready to
start editing a new project I'll be
copying the RAW files to these two 240
gig hyper X's which I'll be setting up
in raid 1 you heard that right
raid 1 on my current system I've been
using 2 SSDs and raid 0 as my working
raw drive and while the performance
boost is nice the thought of losing all
my work from one Drive dying has taunted
me for far too long so I'm playing it
safe this time around and opting for
redundancy once I'm finished editing a
project I'll wipe the HyperX drives
clean and keep them open for the next
project for all my games and other
programs I ruined yet another external
hard drive and acquire this one terabyte
dkv oh my storage setup might seem a bit
confusing to some but there you have it
and I was just kidding about using the
drives as coasters they make better
doorsteps as I mentioned earlier the
bulk of this systems workload will be
video editing but I'll also be using it
as a testbed from time to time and since
the 59 30 K I'll eventually be using
supports up to 40 PCIe lanes I can go
buckwild and do some substantial
multi-gpu testing to do so I'll either
need a monstrous power supply or a bolt
of lightning I couldn't find any
lightning bolts so I sought out this G
Series 1600 watt power supply from Leppa
this beast sports an 80 plus gold rating
and has a peak power wattage of 1700
watts so I can stack up those video
cards without a hiccup plus this unit
has over voltage protection which I
don't think the lightning bolt does and
last but certainly not least I'll be
using the define R for blackout from
fractal design which is still arguably
one of the best workstation chasse EES
currently available for the price as an
editor I certainly appreciate the ample
drive support and stealthy acoustics
making this a great choice for my needs
and those ladies and gentlemen are all
the parts for this insanely powerful
haswell-e x99 ddr4 driven computer let
me know what you guys think of these
components and if you would have opted
for something different
also please like and favorite the video
if you're enjoying the series so far it
helps me a lot
speaking of which it's time for part two
where I do a time-lapse build of this
thing so go check that out now and I'll
see you there you have to click the
annotation otherwise I can't filled it
any Daniel oh hi Paul are you still on
tinder</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
