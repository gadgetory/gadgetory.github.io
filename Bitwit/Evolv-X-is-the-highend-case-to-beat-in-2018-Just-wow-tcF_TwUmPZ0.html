brought to you by fantex berta gear
enter max be quiet and cable mod you can
learn more about their products and the
links below what's going on guys kal
what they would hear we are at the
fantex booth now here at Computex 2018
they just showed me a brand new flagship
case that is gonna be hard to beat this
is one of the first sweets that I've
come to here at Computex and it's it's
already off to a great start this is the
evolve X and it's gonna retail for 199
MSRP that's US dollars launching in
August this is a very worthy successor
to the hugely popular evolve ATX which
was one of my favorite cases it still is
til this day and I really love that
they've preserved the design language
here it looks very similar to the
original but there have been some some
great improvements here for starters
there's a ton more airflow which the
original admitted admittedly suffer from
a little bit but here we've got these
huge gaps here for three times more
intake at the front there's also tons of
ventilation at the top for five times
more exhaust so this is the like that
alone is just is just pretty amazing the
fact that they've been able to preserve
the look as well the front i/o has been
improved we've got two USB three USB 3.1
gen2 type-c mic and headphone jacks and
to RGB buttons we've got our addressable
RGB at the front now so one is your mode
and then you've got another one for
different colors and stuff so very nice
there kind of folds down to preserve a
very clean look at the front there the
front panel pops off just the same as
the last one like so no wires no wires
just some gold contacts cable free to
lists removal and then you've also got a
removable dust filter that's also
toolless with a magnet radiator support
is through the roof on this thing you
basically get up to 360 or 420 at the
front and 360 or 280 at the top you can
actually mount to 360 simultaneously
which you could not do in the last case
so this is already shaping up to be an
enthusiast water coolers dream case
there's also a drain port right here you
can actually install you know makes
making your the installation of your
drain port that much simpler and
convenient to use right here at the
front
that's actually a really nice addition
additionally you've got two screws here
that you could use to secure down the
side panel which is now on hinges so you
don't have to use these two holes if you
don't want to if you just want
convenient access and you want to be
able to slide the side panel out like
that you can but if you're concerned
about it moving around or accidentally
opening when you're moving it around or
in shipping you can use those two screws
right there to mount it securely and
that goes for the other side panel as
well power buttons on the top let's take
a look at the top really quick you've
got two thumb screws at the back and
once those are removed they are captive
you can slide the front panel I'm sorry
the top panel back and remove a very
nice removable radiator bracket with two
thumb screws it's super simple to
install there's there's actually some
tabs here just see but it reduces the
number of screws you have to remove and
there's also cable ties here which is
really nice these little hooks so that
you can just sort of streamline your
cable management if you're installing
radiators there's also a fill port just
like they have a drain port down below
they have a fill port at the top just to
make your custom water cooling
experience that much more simplified and
streamlined there's also this plate
cover they include one of them that you
can put pretty much anywhere at the top
here just so that you can close off and
remove or eliminate any sort of
circulation that might be happening
unnecessarily if you should be mounting
a radiator up here cutouts for your fan
cables located one at the front one at
the back that's also nice to see if we
open up this side panel you can see that
it's also on hinges and you get a really
clean backside obviously a CPU cooler
cut out and these nice little panels
cable covers that are held in place by
clasps little little tabs here which i
think is way better than having screws
it's just completely tool-less you can
get in and out very easily and if you
remove these you can kind of see that
they're also on hinges and they're kind
of hiding your cable management area you
actually have sort of two lanes of cable
management here with velcro straps on
either side which is really nice so you
can have one side for all of your hard
drives by the way I almost forgot to
mention that you can mount six hard
drives
on the opposite side of this panel right
here they all kind of get mounted
horizontally and so you can have plenty
of cable routing for that and then on
the other end the other Lane so to speak
you have more room for your ATX power
cables and things like that
additionally you'll notice that there
are no cable grommets however they've
kind of solved that issue by having
these cable plates that are held in
place by these some screws which I
accidentally just removed completely but
if you just loosen it you can sort of
slide them over to the right or the left
depending on which way you're facing and
completely cover up any sort of eyesore
when you're when you're doing cable
management it's actually a really cool
solution that I have not seen before in
a case but I can't wait to test it out
myself
there's also little hooks for you know
additional just for making cable
management all that much easier where
these tabs are holding up the the SSD
cover plates as they're called
speaking of SSDs you can mount up to
nine of them back here it does include
some trays so you can mount three SSDs
here you can mount three SSDs on the
back of this plate or three more on the
back of that plate which is just
incredible this is a very versatile case
so you could buy this case not even
knowing what you're gonna use it for and
then when you finally figure it out
chances are you can probably make it
happen no problem the other thing I want
to mention is that there is a hard drive
cage down here it's not visible right
now because it's not installed but that
can house up to four additional hard
drives meaning you could fit ten three
and a half inch drives in this case
which is insane I'm gonna close these up
or actually before I do that there is a
pre installed GPU bracket that basically
eliminates GPU sag and the way that this
works it actually mounts to the backside
right here
actually I guess I'd be facing this way
once you remove the thumb screws and
essentially you're the expansion slots
of your GPU will slot into these cutouts
and then you can basically mount this
down you actually push it down to sort
of create a seesaw effect where your GPU
on the other side is forced to sort of
pop up and that essentially eliminates
your sag and they've demonstrated this
to me here at the suite earlier and it
works flawlessly and the nice thing is
that it's invisible it's completely
behind the motherboard tray so you don't
even notice that
it's there but your GPUs are looking
perfect the other thing that I forgot to
mention that's very important is that
there's now sort of a sealant on both of
the side panels so that again you're
just preserving that amount of airflow
you're reducing the amount of air
leakage and it also minimizes noise as
well so that completely closes off the
side panels once you get them shut but
we're not done yet there is still more
to discover about this case you know how
fan text is always stepping up their
game with innovation well check this out
if you get kind of low you can see that
there's a whole second system mounted to
the roof of the case upside down with an
optional bracket that you can buy if you
want to make this into a dual system
chassis obviously its mini ITX but look
like they're still able to get a 120
millimeter AO installed onto this little
system and with the GPU bracket a
vertical GPU riser card that's also sold
separately you can even have a discrete
graphics card connected to that second
system they've got three video cards in
here right now and two systems I'm just
I can't really hasn't really hit me yet
but this is pretty awesome you'll also
notice that there's addressable RGB
lighting right here on the power supply
shroud and it looks really clean and
just seamless you don't see individual
LED hotspots like you do on a lot of
cases these days simply because they've
used more LEDs so the resolution of this
lighting is is just phenomenal look at
this case so this is kind of just
showcasing what's possible as far as
custom water cooling a beautiful loop
that's set up in house by the fantex
team they've got two graphics cards in
there that are being held up by that
built-in GPU bracket that I just showed
you earlier and they look they look
perfectly straight to me you've got
three 140s the front here so that they
are utilizing the the 420 radiator
support at the front and another two 280
at the top there and by the way in case
you were wondering how both of these
systems are being powered right now we
are using fan Texas very own revolt X
power supply this is not new per se it
does
have it's sort of power splitter built
into it so it's got two ATX cables two
eight-penny PSS and so forth in just a
single unit the one Edition now is that
they finally have a 1000 watt version
that you can purchase
now if the evolve ex doesn't tickle your
fancy fantex is showing off a brand new
prototype that is still months away but
has very similar functionality and
internal layout as the evolve ex but it
doesn't really focus so much on I don't
know things like RGB lighting things
that you might not want or be willing to
pay extra for but still want to really
take advantage of all that functionality
this is the Eclipse P 600 s and like I
said it's a prototype so it's not
finished with the paint it's very
bare-bones at the moment you can see you
still get tempered glass side panel it's
got these panels at the front and top
that can be left in place as is for
optimal silence and acoustics or you can
easily pop them out to lessly
mind you and and open it up for airflow
there's also sound dampening on the on
the back of these so again it's gonna be
very good if you want to keep a quiet
chassis now the other thing about this
mesh if you take a closer look it's it's
not actually plastic or metal it's a
brand new material that's sort of a
fabric material actually it kind of
gives the the case a more organic or
natural look which I really like and the
beauty of this mesh material is actually
kind of serves two purposes it's a
two-fold here one is that it collects
more dust it actually captures a lot
more dust than traditional dust filters
to additionally it just allows more air
to go through I believe they were saying
it's got something like a 92 to 94
percent passed through as opposed to
like 70 percent which is the maximum you
can get out of a conventional dust
filter which I guess I would like to put
this on the test bench in and actually
see if it makes much of a difference but
it sounds very promising right now and
it just looks great if you look on this
side too you'll notice this sound that
this side panel has sand up and
dampening material as well it's kind of
got a nice nice touch to it and it's
also hinged just for very convenient and
quick access all the same cable
management on the back everything you
love about the evolved X but different I
should also mention these panel are
going to be
in place by hooks on one end and some
stronger magnets on the other and you
could probably expect the price point of
this case to be a little bit cheaper
than the Evolve ex because they are they
are removing some features that not
every user really needs now in addition
to cases fantex is also showing off some
brand new fans for the whole new design
there's no actual official name for
these fans yet they're working on a
super awesome one I'm sure but but these
are looking pretty nice so far you can
see that they're just sort of simple
they're very minimalistic they're black
they match with pretty much any
component that you would pair them with
they have vibration pads for reduced
noise and vibration obviously you've
also got a very a very nice improved
thin blade fan blade design that's a
glass fiber actually in in construction
and it just allows a bit more precise
manufacturing so they can get the blades
just 0.7 millimeters away from the away
from the frame itself
you can also daisy chain these fans
together probably anywhere from three to
four fans depending on obviously the
power delivery of whatever header you're
connecting it to and your motherboard
but that's really nice and solves the
issue of running out of fan headers or
needing a fan hub in your case things
like that
it's especially useful if you're doing
custom water cooling you're gonna have
radiators and a lot of fans potentially
in push-pull that those fans add up
quickly especially with more cases these
days just allowing for more fan mounting
points and so forth fan Tex has also
been testing these fans not just with
heat sinks regular heat sinks and mesh
material but also with low density
radiators as well just to make sure that
they're covering all their bases
depending on what kind of variables any
enthusiasts might be building with just
to ensure maximum performance regardless
of the configuration now circling back
to that really cool fabric mesh material
that I showed you guys earlier fan Tex
is also playing around the idea and
they're actually pretty committed to
releasing sort of mesh paneling for
their shift and shift X cases which i
think is a fantastic idea
these cases are mainly built with water
cooling in mind you know the airflow
might be a little bit limited on the
original models for air coolers but with
this new design with just mesh paneling
on various sides it really opens up the
possibilities of what you can install
into this chassis but they haven't
really decided exact
yet on what kind of paneling they want
to use if they want to use it just for
the sides or maybe potentially for the
front as well and also what colors
because with this mesh fabric material
you can really get creative there's a
bunch of different options that they
have laid out here just some samples
they even have like a really cool like
fabric material here now this this
hasn't breathable at all so this would
just be purely cosmetic but it does look
really cool and would certainly match
your Google home or other other cool
trending device so I'm gonna ask you
guys what what do you what do you think
here do you like the mesh paneling in
the first place if so where would you
like to see it live on the ship decks
where do you think it looks the best
what color do you think looks the best
what patterns do you like which ones
don't you don't you prefer and and so
forth so altogether I'm not exactly sure
when this is gonna be released again
they're still making a lot of decisions
in this process so hopefully you guys
can help them out there so that about
covers it for the fantex booth here at
Computex 2018
rest assured guys I will definitely be
getting my hands on a bunch of this
stuff including the evolve X and doing a
review for you guys as well as a pretty
awesome build so stay tuned for all of
that and go ahead and check out the
