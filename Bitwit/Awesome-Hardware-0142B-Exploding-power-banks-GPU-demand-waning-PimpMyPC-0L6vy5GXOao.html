from strands of her hair right yes how
that works yeah her real name's Rapunzel
most people don't know that so we're
live we're live on okay cool hey welcome
everyone to awesome Hardware episode 140
Oh
142 this is side B which means we've
already streamed side a if you missed
that you can check it out on Paul's
channel go to youtube.com slash Paul's
Hardware or you can follow the link in
the video description below if you're
watching us on Twitch welcome back to
which how's it going hope you guys are
all doing fantabulously this is a live
tech news show where Paul and I'd like
to get a super wasted no we though all
the time
we we generally have a few beers like a
healthy healthy buzz yeah very very part
of a balanced drunkards breakfast I
think nothing to absorb it and of course
not and if you guys are ibly legal
drinking age feel free to drink along
with us it's always fun drink
responsibly we we do occasionally swear
in this show so if you are sensitive to
that or have little kids around be aware
um I thought there was gonna be more
that's okay that's fine I got slightly
more than that anymore that's fine it's
a social injustice great white indeed we
are very tasty Buzzard Lost Coast
brewery friends of the show cheers to
all of you guys at home they sent me
stuff once it's awesome any good beers
and yeah we're just gonna talk more
about some tech news we'll be doing a
Pitt my PC that returns tonight as well
as some male time opening up some of the
things that you have sent me in my to
make my P o box words so let's dive
right into the news starting with you
know you forgot oh they're all the other
stores Wow
buy stuff I feel like it's been so long
since do the show um my store if you are
interested is big with tech slash store
I sell lots of things like hoodies
amazing quality desk mats surprisingly
female shirts for all of your female
friends out there I know we don't have
many of them the ones that do deserve to
be
look it's purple it's burps wifey sauce
lobsters and there's also glasses mugs
very nice glasses the glasses are now 20
ounce they have been for a while now so
those are cool eventually we'll
eventually we'll try the 20 ounce
glasses I know I really do need to just
hit John up like send me some freaking
glasses so we can have him for the show
here but Paul story is Paul's hardware
net yes it is he's got lots of stuff as
well a lot of great merchandise I love
that two-tone hoodie that's freaking
awesome the thumbscrew hoodie Hannah and
also the these are lightweight hoodies
so they're kind of like it's kind of
like t-shirt material maybe slightly
thicker than that like all-weather
hoodies yeah if super super nice too
great great for springtime and if you
tend to run hot or something like that
but you know plenty of old t-shirts
maybe a little too chilly for you that
may be a great option but if you happen
to buy anything from either of our
stores will yell Johnson at you at the
end of the show which is a weird little
fun thing we do if you buy something
from both of our stores during the show
will double Johnson the out of you
and that's always fun
so both yeah it's both sides hey you and
with that said let's dive into our first
article which is from CPSC not
necessarily a tech news outlet or
anything but this is the Consumer
Product Safety Commission website pretty
obvious what they're into what they do
and this article in particular though
this little post here is about an
amazonbasics power bank that has been
recalled due to its proneness of fire
and chemical burn causing nice which is
pretty sketchy so that's what it looks
like there's actually a few different
models that use the you know similar
innards from the same manufacturer and
China of course with the model B 0 0 0
lr k 8 eb 0 Oro printed on it so check
your battery banks everyone if it's an
Amazon basics model because it might
explode in your friggin face the recall
involves six different models or
variants of the unit 16100 milliamp
option 10,000 a 5600 a 3000 and a 2
thousand milliamp model all of these are
sporting micro USB ports if you have one
immediately unplug it and stop using it
before you die and then contact Amazon
for instructions on how to return it for
a full refund they shouldn't give you
any problems because they are aware of
the issue they've already received 53
reports of power banks overheating which
isn't a huge deal overheating that's
getting a little warm that's not a huge
one report of chemical burns one report
though of chemical burns due to contact
with battery acid and four reports of
property damage involving fire and smoke
damage so and you know that chemical
burns one that's gonna lead to more
stuff right
oh like like like like like hurt pain
like what do you mean because like
that's that's how Joker became Joker's I
have to assume however we've suffered
from this time to have yes probably
follow a similar path this is true we
have an a we have a supervillain in our
midst
on the roads battery bank beware dandy
surprise I'm really surprised from from
this is just some shoddy quality coming
from Guangdong China
well well Gwang no one saw that coming
woah I think I'm slightly better at
pronouncing Chinese words Wong
okay more of us it's more of a sound
than a word all right perfect
exactly I'm pronounceable symbol all our
Chinese viewers understood everything I
just said alright so um now that that's
out of the way guys hope you're safe and
no one's gotten affected by that but
let's talk about our next article here
from our good friend Anthony at weak
town this is about potentially a GPU
demand for crypto mining showing signs
of slowdown okay hmm and this was
actually an article that sort of isn't
really out yet it's it's only available
in the digit times special section which
is there before going to press like
their pre-release section which you
actually need a 410 dollar yearly
subscription to in order to access these
articles that really
you know saturated the the public market
yet
the public space of all these tech
reviewers so there's not as much digging
that Anthony could have done here just
because he didn't have full access to
the article but what he does know from
the article it says that nvidia and AMD
have been slowing down their
developments he doesn't have full access
well I would assume not because the
article is very very short
maybe he read like the synopsis blurb at
the top or something like that I'm
actually not sure maybe he did have
access to it but if he did it's a pretty
short article because there's not a
whole lot of detail here it didn't sound
like he like had full access but that's
just what I what I gathered from it but
at any rate AMD and NVIDIA have been
slowing their developments down of their
of their new GPU architectures and
prolonging their existing GPU platforms
life cycle since the profitability for
graphics cards has been weakening in in
recent weeks but that's alright that's a
row that's a relative term that's a
relative term it's like it Israel
they're no they're no longer making
5,000 percent profit there's any making
more like 4,000 right it's like this the
the the beginning signs of the decline
even though it's still way up and nvidia
may be you know eventually controlling
GPU prices right because right now they
have pricings been mostly determined by
the retailers so Nvidia might crack down
on the GPU prices among all this and
they also might make mining specific
cards there's a couple articles going on
going around about that this was a rumor
from a crypto mining blog and I forgot
to link the article so Paul will
diligently save my ass
where it was a rumor from crypto mining
blog but I don't you can probably just
find you know just type in Nvidia mining
cards and it's probably an article on
TechRadar TechRadar pro um yeah here's
the current music card itself the
picture that I've seen going around yeah
looks like a so tech card a
you're right it does that travel very
much it's a prima job like an identical
to that you'll notice there is no IO
there they didn't even bother to put a
bracket on there cuz right why do you
need that for yeah and it's gonna be
based on the same GP 102 GPU as the
tight necks tight next little P and
1080i yeah so there's a couple specs
about it 3200 CUDA cores this is all
again speculation 1582 megahertz 5 gigs
of gddr5 X TDP of 250 Watts
dual fans on the cooler the one that
this pictured here five copper heat
pipes and a hash rate of 47 mega hashes
per second in etherium and 879 hashes a
second for Manero this is the leak
claims this infos straight from the
manufacturer no pricing at the moment
and I think it's gonna be a lot of
people are gonna think that this means
that GPU prices are gonna immediately
fall down what's more mining specific
cards come out or once any mining
specific cards come out but the article
also reminds us that a big part of this
is also because there's a huge scarcity
of vram and vram is something that's
used across all GPUs whether it's mining
specific or gaming related so there's
there's an issue there and additionally
some people might not some miners might
still prefer to go the geforce route or
the radeon route simply because those
cards tend to have a higher resale value
than something like this that doesn't
even have video outputs no gamers gonna
buy this card let's say you know when
it's time to resell this thing so for
physics what you could use it for
physics and there's a granite it's so
much smaller market than then the whole
gaming landscape but we also don't know
how well these are gonna be priced or
how terribly this will be priced if
they're much more expensive than you
know an equivalent 1080i or or gaming
card you know that uses the same GPU
then it's gonna take longer for miners
to make their money back their
investment back on a card like this and
they're just gonna go for the GeForce or
Radeon cards anything I think in today's
market this would sell no matter what
yes probably not for quite as much as
you'd pay for an equivalence
equivalently performing GPU like a 1080i
or something like that because of the
hits of the resale value but like I mean
you can you can see what they've done
here they basically try it like so
Nvidia the like push pumping out the
GPUs is not invidious problem they they
can make plenty of GPUs the problem is
pairing those GPUs up with memory and
the memory is a very expensive part and
that's what's preventing them from
putting more cards out in the market so
they've taken this and that guy we've
got our GP 102 GPU which we can just
crank out all day and we've been working
on for a while and you know we've
refined the process they're probably
getting really good yields on it by now
and we can plot that on a card that
we've completely minimized the excess
cost everywhere else so no i/o means
that at least for something like HDMI
you now have to pay any licensing costs
for that as well as the hardware all
those connectors do cost money and then
pairing something like GP 102 with five
gigs of VRAM which is completely
impractical when it comes to gaming but
you don't need a ton of VRAM for biting
so you've cut down the excess the frills
on the card that you don't need when you
make it mining specific card and then
the key factor that's preventing them
from pumping out more graphics cards
which is the scarcity of gddr5 X they
basically put what they have considered
to be the minimum amount on there to
still give you the good mining
performance so it'll be interesting to
see if you know if that if that cut in
vram for these mining cards will be
allocated to the gaming cards in such a
way that it actually lowers the pricing
a little bit I don't know well the other
stuff I thought I thought you were gonna
talk about this story but I should have
pointed it out to you but there's
another story going around right now no
you are talking about this right which
one memory prices no you're not talking
about this memory prices are going up
like not as in memory prices over the
past year have doubled in everything
memory prices as of
two months ago when everyone was like
wow memory prices are really absurd and
crazy and really high and some articles
came out that was like hey probably in
2018 we're gonna see Laura memory prices
they have gone up and they're probably
gonna continue to go up
yeah so that's a pretty crappy the
article does mention that you know
memory is video memory is expected to
improve later this year in terms of
availability but if the prices are
already going up then by the time we
have more memory way later this year it
might just bring the prices of memory
the pricing of memory back down to what
it was a few months ago not necessarily
lower it you know it's a significant
amount so I don't know it's all messed
up man yep yeah the only orphan orphan a
nice and in chat asks about NAND flash
prices and if there is one silver lining
one area where we're like well at least
this isn't also continuing to be crappy
NAND does seem to be relenting some and
SSD prices are not absurd yeah I don't
think they're quite down to the lowest
point that they were at last year or
earlier in 2017 but they're they're
reasonable you know you can get it you
can get a 256 gig SSD for 60 to 80 bucks
that's a decent performer and you can
get 500 500 ish gig SSD for in the low
hundred dollar range and that's not too
terrible so anyway thank God for that
yeah but man the memory like memory like
many old prices need to come down and
the memory crisis is a hundred percent
because of cellphones yeah ddr4 yeah
Danny phone okay all right enough
Corsair has accidentally leaked out
their latest case the 1000d the obsidian
1000d which was spotted on their own
website as well as Amazon's so this was
just a complete you know complete
screw-up from a couple people not sure
if this was intentional or not probably
not but it happens all the time and
time it does article or outlets like
Tom's Hardware tend to pick it up and
tell us all the juicy details so what do
we know about this case right now well
it's a behemoth it is one of the biggest
cases Corsairs ever made it's actually
bigger than the nine hundred date which
says a lot because I think it's got
wings that's got wings like the cosmos
it's got a wingspan it opens up looks
like it's got some latches or it's on
hinges right some back hinges on either
side tempered glass on both sides so you
can show off the cable management as
well it's a dual system case so it
houses an ATX system as well as a mini
ITX system but if you look at the back
there looks like there's only one power
supply and also one i/o right when one
area for the shield so I'm curious to
see how they're actually gonna configure
it if it you know if you're gonna have
to do some pass-through action people
are speculating that maybe it's a single
power supply that has a splitter but
then it's unclear how you're gonna how
you would choose to power one system on
versus the other it'd be interesting if
we can get a closer look at the i/o the
front i/o to see if there's two power
buttons on the case or something like
that but it doesn't look like we're
gonna get that right now it's up here
and all I can tell is it you must be
three backlit USB and headphone jacks
yeah so kind of fuzzy on how that's all
gonna work
but it is kind of kind of neat that we
are gonna get a dual system dual chassis
here it looks like we can also house a
pair of 480 millimeter radiators at the
front of the case something you don't
see too often is is having dual
radiators at the front or or any of any
side of a case for that matter so this
thing is that just goes to show you know
just how huge this thing is and the
aesthetics kind of or someone borrowed
from the recently launched 500 D steel
body as we mentioned tempered glass side
panels on the top and the front are made
of brushed aluminum and they look pretty
nice it also includes a commander pro
fan and lighting controller
I'm kind of surprised it only has one
one one yeah one fan yeah unless it was
a typo and they met commander Pro fans
no the commander pro fan and lighting
control Oh Oh got it okay yes I was
thinking just but the fans are very
different the lights into it yes by fan
and letting controller okay so as far as
actual fans included didn't say did we
see any fans here I don't see any that
are visible in the pictures right I mean
which makes sense because but the case
like this most people are gonna add
their own fans anyway you're gonna want
some ml pros or some NOK to us in here
just you know you're gonna trick it out
yourself with whatever RGB fantasies
you're hung up on and then we've also
got how much do you think this this case
is gonna be journey through the price
no I didn't ah speculation any guesses
any wild eight hundred wild guesses I
mean we're definitely in that upper
echelon at 500 bucks 500 okay yeah
alright which is no so that's a bargain
it's a bargain
whoo $300 off only $500 it's like you
know how they always say like you know
like the top ravier like you know you
got the damn good award little put the
little badges on the retail side oh yeah
just have like you know Paul's like over
estimated price hardware a little bad
you're a little badge I mean that was
just based on like what I've seen case
manufacturers charge for they're like
best and biggest case you know like your
fan texts ear and to elite and all that
right and that seems to be the trend
right one case manufacturer or one
manufacturer comes out with this product
that's phenomenally more expensive than
anything that's ever existed and then
all of a sudden other manufacturers are
like hey that exist now we can we can
start upping our price to we know that
like Nvidia do the same thing when they
released was the Titan X like their
first $1000 GPU and now it's like I mean
you know inflation and aside $1,000
GPU we don't even like think twice like
that's just like a new standard for that
top tier of product so it's a
you know things aren't getting cheaper
to say the least
anyway I've been lied to all my life so
let's move on to our last article for
this half before we dive into Pitt my PC
this is a quick quick news article from
overclocked 3d about Microsoft
officially releasing Intel Specter and
meltdown microcode in Windows Update oh
and you know it's been it's been decided
just in general that distributing these
Specter and and you know these these
micro codes on a hardware level just
isn't isn't quite as viable as we'd like
it to be simply due to the countless
number of motherboard models different
hardware configurations that makes it
really impossible to deliver a universal
micro code that works for everyone
plus most users absolutely know how to
flash the BIOS yeah if you're relying on
end-users to flash their BIOS in order
to patch this then you're gonna have a
very very low adoption rate yes indeed
so at a general consumer level Microsoft
is sort of stepping in here and they're
expanding Intel's coverage of their
micro code updates so that Windows 10
users on version 1709 can access updates
for for skylake KB Lake and and copulate
processors Windows 7 and 8.1 will be
covered shortly after and Microsoft has
made this as an official announcement
they've suggested that all Windows 10
users update to 1709 which is the most
secure version of course and reminds us
that version 1607 also known as the
anniversary update will soon reach its
end of life support on April 10th sensor
ominous end of life through the cutting
legs
I know it's smothering it with a pillow
we'll be pulling the plug okay then
it'll be incinerated ashes be spread
just my PC hey guys I'm tweeted in some
pictures of your beloved systems and
Paul and I are gonna laugh at them no
I'm just kidding we're gonna give you
some helpful tips to hopefully look look
and feel of your sister
and make everything look all broke that
sexy sexy and stuff so our first our
first submission is from post gaben with
the pentium g 4400 four gigs of DDR 4 it
says ddr4 our IP I don't know what rip
means rest in peace because oh because
it's a smaller gigs one terabyte WD
black GTX 560 TI m SI h 110 gaming
motherboard an EVGA 450 bt power supply
we definitely got sort of a older semi
budget system here again with 4 gigs of
ram we got a Pentium chip and an older
graphics card 500 series GPU from chief
a g-force car like that old ass cooler
man and the Intel stock cooler is the
first thing that stands out to me one
because it's just so ugly and and oh rip
mint Ripjaws oh really
cuz it's a rip so it looks like a
g.skill no that's Aegis nevermind I
think you just met ripped yeah it was
just cool that's just pure quinces
I'm sorry ok so Intel stock cooler we
have to give him credit though it's a
modded Intel stock cooler he is blacked
out the Intel logo which got rid of the
blue which would contrast which would
have not matched with the other colors
in the build but but I feel like the
blue also distracts you from that
god-awful cable the cable is just it's
gonna be there nothing to show you where
the power goes that's where the power
goes I want to see the power
well let's highlight it for you we also
have we have a single LED fan right as
the sole light source in this build no
I'm sorry there's a friend LED fan too
it's just not that weights is what type
of physicist this is one of those that's
like one of the like overseas brands I I
could be wrong that's gonna be like this
you have a $40.00 Corsair Maglev fan
alright so what
so I said replaced I mean honestly the
hardware so old that it's not worth
upgrading the system yeah it's just time
for an overall fresh system so like Paul
was saying earlier maybe wait a month
and see what risin two has to offer or
second gen risin has in store for us and
if you like what you see make the switch
I mean if you really wanted to keep our
like if we're just doing our typical
critiques you know there's a few loose
cables in here that you could tidy up a
little bit here and there but that's not
gonna really affect anything performance
wise yeah so yeah I mean honestly I
think based on a level of hardware
you're working with I think this is a
pretty nice-looking build yeah I think
that's I agree that's what it boils down
to for me yeah yeah I knew it's not like
your case has a side panel or anything
so something you can be able to see any
of the loose your cables and stuff it's
hard to say what you should go for first
when it comes to upgrades but um yeah it
seems like you know what you're doing as
far as the bill goes but yeah and next
gen you know arising builds with a lot
more cpu horsepower I think you'll
you'll you'll feel you'll feel the
improvement that oh yeah big-time
thanks gaben move on next we have Kyle
Kyle my other half in the Kyle with a
core i7 6700 K gigabyte Gaz 170 xqd 3 GT
X 1080 and 16 gigabytes of RAM so first
off I would sell your GT X 1080 for any
any debt that you're in yep immediately
pay off all your life debt with that
single card spend the rest on the
hookers and cocaine yes absolutely
sinus picks no dick picks please just so
the hackers we only have a single
picture here so although this is an NZXT
this is the noctus noctus for 420 board
for 20 to 420 the duck just 420 blaze it
so or if it's got like the the under
undercarriage lighting and stuff like
that
I feel like if the side panel was on you
wouldn't be able to see see these two
LED strips right right now they're
standing
to me like wow yeah looks gross but we
only have this single picture I will
give you the immediate critique that it
definitely seems like your computer
lives on the floor
yeah and that's a bad that's bad man
publicly shamed I would highly
recommends for the sake of future
cleaning of your system to find a better
solution for that it looks like you have
a vert desk possibly a sit-stand desk I
would just scoot it to the right by 5 or
6 inches and put the PC to the left of
it but just give it give it us give it
something to sit on and give it a small
pedestal let's raise it up a little bit
I find it curious that you have orange
cable extensions right but black and red
case and yeah black and red case and
then you have this big ol knot to a
cooler then which I believe is NHD 15
it's like you cared about color
coordination at one point and then just
gave up so I don't know this is a
conundrum because it's like what do you
tell them to fix if your focus is
aesthetics then maybe swap the NHD 15
for one of their chroma ones or or that
I mean because you can get it man you
can get equivalent performance with a
much better-looking deal a much better
looking setup yeah I just I feel like
your cable extension is really a waste
it doesn't match with anything right can
you swap it just make a black or red one
yeah just swap it or black and red all
black would be much better than the
orange yeah and then and then you've got
a stock Nvidia cooler which doesn't
match with anything unless it's silver
black and green so what heats I don't
know I was it they there are
modifications you can make to those fans
edition cards to make the LED white or
whatever you've seen that happen yeah
that's ending on how far you willing to
go also a cable extension I mean
don't bother with this unless you're
fixing all the other color coordination
issues but a cable extension for your
graphics card would be would be nice I
don't know yeah too many there are too
many things with this build that I feel
like need to be switched and then I of
course go back to the fact that this
probably is a very there's nothing wrong
with this perfectly fine perfectly fine
and it performs very well and it
probably has really good temperatures
and stuff like that so but we have to
keep this a strictly superficial segment
exactly otherwise very superficial
otherwise people giving okay well thank
you Kyle Kyle and things for sending
that in and thanks cat let's with that -
captain Kilroy my PC is ar5 risin 5 1500
X power color r9 380 gigabyte horas X
370 gaming k7 the cooler master ml 240 L
I've got 8 gigs of crucial sport LT at
2666 and some other stuff with an H 500
p4 cooler master recently upgraded to
rising from my old effects okay cool so
nice upgrade all right now you've got
the original H 500 P case which
depending on who you talk to and how
much gamers Nexus they watch it's either
like a functional case that's just fine
and you know maybe doesn't have the best
airflow or it's like the most horrible
thing ever created and you should take
it and destroy it things will explode
destroy it burn it in the fires of hell
hell before it burns you and now it's
perfectly adequate case and it doesn't
look like you have an insane amount of
hardware in there either so you're
probably doing just fine there all right
so like overall everything's looking
pretty good you don't have anything
that's just immediately standing out as
in that looks horrible so we got to be a
little bit more nit picky your front
panel cable connectors here maybe braid
those you can braid those up that would
make those look a little bit
tidy you've got a daisy-chain PCI
Express graphics connectors here I never
really liked the look of those it's
possible to take that little extra hoop
that little extra loop and kind of zip
tie it and and and and work it back
behind the main cable coming from from
behind there and I can make it look a
little bit cleaner so maybe something
like that would make it stand out a
little bit less beyond that everything
is looking pretty clean yeah I mean no
real complaints hey it would look pretty
blingy if you matched your rear exhaust
fan to the other fans that are on your
radiator yeah that look kind of cool
yeah that could balance everything out a
little bit more but like Paul said
you've made all the right moves here for
the most part yeah I mean you've got a
you've got a lot of blank space at the
front but I mean it's a larger case so
room for expansion right
got that one SATA cable that's going
into the grommet and another one that's
just going straight behind that
motherboard tray panel okay that kind of
kind of pokes my OCD just a little bit
true that's true I mean again everything
looks really good overall so we have to
be a bit more NIC nitpicky here a little
more symmetry but yeah you know
obviously you can swap the cables out
for for some black extensions or
something like that which you know if
they were custom sleeved or something
then it would make it make the system
look overall a bit more like a showpiece
okay final critique and then again this
is just not a big deal but just
something you could do if you want to
make a nice a more aesthetically
pleasing swoosh with your tubing here
for your for your CPU cooler I don't
know I feel like right now that kind of
goes across the middle and then arcs
back and just just make it a nice nice
it should come down and then loop in how
do you prefer to bind your AO tubes Pole
I mean if you can get away without doing
it I think that's best because that's
just best but like I would take a single
or at most two zip ties going around
them so it's minimal and it's it's not
very avoidable and then twist
zip ties around so that the clasps are
in the back so they're not visible yeah
that's where you can kind of get them to
go together
right without looking too too heinous I
guess yeah cool
next up is Alan dub yeah with this he
has the fire and ice bill r7 1800
excellently zero one one case crosser 6
here motherboard 16 gigs of flair X and
g.skill memory at 3200 speed an asus
strix 1080 cio see of course our H X
1000 I power supply 960 Evo turn 50 gig
SSD crucial MX 500 one terabyte also SSD
for Triple A games 3 2 terabyte
Barracuda pro hard drives in raid 0 for
steam 6 courser ml 120 fans ek blocks
and rads and source 2 cables singularity
protium reservoir and bits power
fittings Wow damn what what an all-star
lineup of parts here this definitely you
can tell was a labor of love
as far as builds are concerned hey I
like the the like I know this is all
right so this is probably Allen's choice
as implemented by and sourced but I
really like your choice of sleeping with
the cable sleeping oh and you've got
you've got a nice color scheme there
what's kind of that accents textured on
there
I think that's classy I like that
definitely um gosh whatever what else
can we say here you know I mean even the
rear cable management is looking looking
quite clean your barracudas are tucked
away as they should be and I'm really
digging that vertical GPU alright with
that block I have just looked so found I
found a critique to make and it's not
anything to do with aesthetics
yeah all right so Alan you have what
appears to be three Seagate green drives
in a raid configuration now these are
the barracudas and I could be wrong
about this but I know on the Western
Digital side the green drives are not
ideal to use and a raid configuration
depending on how often you're using the
system if it's on 24/7 or not and
whether that raid array typically raid
arrays will will have more uptime and
depending on how the Raider is
configured there might be more
maintenance that goes on from the rate
controller so if this is a system that
you're just powering on to play games a
few hours a day or something like that
you're probably just fine if you're
keeping it on 24/7 if you're accessing
the that raid array more frequently like
remotely or something like that to give
the system a reason to keep those drives
spun up more often I might consider
swapping the drives out simply because
the green drives are typically not made
for 24/7 access I would go with either
WD reds or blacks or the equivalents on
the Seagate side that's my only
suggestion beyond that you have a really
really nice system I really like all of
your choices well done and I have to
also say it's very rare when you see
someone pull off red and blue oh yes
well I do not like this color
combination I just think it's not for me
personally but yeah it's not very red
these are kind of there's like a cherry
slightly darker I feel like slightly
yeah maybe that's just a color there the
the picture maybe contrast or something
better but yeah it looks great
really nice build nice man all right and
then I think we have one more sub or a
board with his Xigmatek midgard 2009
case an i-5 2500 K MSI rx 474 gigabyte
gaming x OC and a gigabyte z77 XD 3h 8
gigs of ddr3 Corsair Vengeance at 1600
with
other stuff 250 gig 850 Evo and 7
terabyte miscellaneous HD DS ok this is
another system that seems pretty stacked
with hardware ooh looks like a full
house in this case thank you also for
the outstanding lighting in these
pictures good picture quality that helps
I mean I like I like what you've done
with the height 4 to 12 adding a more
high-end corsair fan one of those AF
fans or maybe the static pressure one on
there that matches with the rear exhaust
fan that looks really snazzy along with
the the intake that you have at the
bottom of the case looks like we've got
yet another red and blue theme going on
here with the blue accents on your
motherboard heat sinks and it works
though it works I was gonna say again
like we have another example of you know
it's it's not overly done and it's uh
doesn't seem like it's clashing too much
I would say the sticker on your power
supply looks a little bit budget
oriented or maybe just slightly dated
and maybe gonna take take a heat gun to
it or something like that and remove the
the sticker just for a cleaner look
I like the Coolermaster logo on top of
the power supply tasteful more than the
sides only yeah I'd leave the one on top
alone looks fine and cable management is
pretty top notch lovely that's leaving
this list leaving job here is very nice
I mean I can't find much to critique
with this build there's maybe a few
cables over in the hard drive area that
I can't quite tell where they're going
that might be a configuration so you can
pull drives out this is my guess just
because there's a couple molex adapters
or cables sticking out there that I'm
not sure about but honestly even those
are routed pretty well so it's not it's
not very noticeable at all yeah I'm kind
of curious what the situation is up here
at the looks like possibly an old
optical drive mount or something like
that that was there was ripped out of
there that's definitely standing out but
it's hard to say for sure with these
pictures because the side panel isn't
done but I would guess that with the
side panel on that that's not gonna be
visible at all yeah that's the only
thing that stands out like you know not
not looking super clean right so good
job great job it's on board yes thank
you so thank you everyone who submitted
their systems for PIM IPC we'll be doing
this again
in a week or so so don't be discouraged
if you can get picked this week nope
let's let's do some mail time ma'am um
in fact we can actually do a combo here
if you want to start reading off some
questions while I also unbox things and
open envelopes okay alrighty I'm gonna
start reading donation comments this
one's from bazinga X $10 donation need a
recommendation for monitor more than 100
megahertz 100 Hertz
not megahertz Hertz refresh rate 2
millisecond or better g-sync ultra wide
curved greater than or equal to 34
inches basic capable prefer quality over
price will end up getting four of them
for a multi monitor system bazinga I
feel like if you entered all of that
into a drill-down search and a website
you probably come up with like two
monitors that actually meet all those
criteria I don't know if the monitor off
the top of my head that would match up
to that especially when you're talking
about greater than an equal to 34 inch
also I'd be curious what resolution
you're interested in probably 4k at that
size so yeah but I don't I don't know
the exact model to tell you what what to
get I can say that my preferred monitor
manufacturers the brands that I
typically like and have had a good
experience with would include Asus BenQ
Acer Samsung
thus named all the big ones yeah so
check for one of those MSI is making
gaming monitors now I doubt they have
this specific oh and what's he looking
for
Oh ultra wide curve yeah oh he did say
ultra wide so Acer predator X 35 is what
you want to go for I didn't even see old
curved ultra wide the Acer predator X 35
these are also very nice 2 or the Asus
what is that PG 3 I honestly forget I'm
really bad with remembering model
numbers after months of receiving a
product it's PG something I'm sure wide
PG 3 4 8 q haha PG 3 4 8 Q that's the
one it's already switched yes yes there
it is blows which is about looks like
it's about 1,200 bucks right now
depending where you buy it okay all
right so sorry that's next I have a
letter here from Charlie Charlie says
I'll just read it briefly I won't go
through the whole thing but he said dear
bit wit hi my name is Charles and I am
11 years old you were my favorite
youtuber that's awesome
your videos are awesome and funny I like
your PC build videos the most I built my
first gaming PC over the summer but it
doesn't work at all Oh doesn't work well
at all so the first I use where gtx 1050
it's got an Intel Pentium G 4560 that's
actually a really nice pairing of CPU
and GPU right there with a asrock be 250
and motherboard and bunch of other I
think it's know the case perfectly
perfectly fine if you could please help
me fix it that would be so awesome I
live in Pasadena California thanks so
much
sincerely Charlie Charlie I don't know
how to really help you because unless I
have the system on hand I'm not going to
be able to fix it or
know what's wrong with it if you want to
send me your system I'm serious if you
mailed me to my mailbox my PA box your
system I would take a look at it and
possibly make a video on it but that's
really the only way it could help you
out at any rate my friend thank you very
much for sending me the lovely letter
and picture of your system I hope I hope
I hope you can find a way to make it
work because it looks like I mean I
don't see any red flags from the picture
even though it's kind of hard to tell
but yeah good good luck good luck I hope
I hope I hope you figure out what's
going on with it let's move on we've got
another other donation here wait I've
lost my next donation is from Scotts
Dilbeck yeah okay
six dollars and sixty six cents lol yes
sure that OD is no comparison better
side note I have three rx 480 Strix I
need to flip for a profit if I could get
a 1080i strix below 1,300 bucks
Hey wow I mean yeah that'd really sell
those four 80s ASAP but it's like yeah I
would want to sell those and then wait
however long it takes for prices to
level up but who knows when that's going
to happen next up is El Jefe reviews
five dollar donation thank you guys Kyle
loving the improved lighting and video
quality in your latest videos on
floatplane keep up the great work and
hashtag free heavy thank you for
noticing lighting this is what Heather
must feel like when I noticed when
shadow or hair hair done Kyle shut up
Lloyd I was like what's going on he's
got an that lady's pointing like not at
us and then this light over here is it's
dressed up like a ghost I just laid over
here it's point at the wall for no
apparent white we're not going a wall
Kyle alright sure sure I can I can thank
slash blame Chris because he's the
lighting fault
okay what do we got here oh this isn't
actual hey an actual Bitcoin Bitcoin
that's actually pretty cool that's
$40,000 yeah what are they so let's
quick before it plummets before the
value plummets it's pretty fun it just
says
so this is just says thank you for your
order if you have any issues with this
product so this is just from the
manufacturer of the seller and there's
no letter or anything from the person
that's straight from Amazon it looks
like someone just ordered it through
Amazon had it shipped here but I don't
see any sort of note attached to it so I
don't really know who to thank this is
awesome for like you should just take a
bunch of pictures of this and upload it
to a stock photo website there's so many
people who get random like that's true I
need a visual representation of Bitcoin
my presentation at work her my article
ler this is not one it so there was a
very small number of bitcoins from my
understanding really really early on
that were minted that actually had a
code on them but that is not not the
case anymore does not have a and now
they're all the same wallet address
they're in dime-a-dozen
I'm gonna open this up yeah yep really
why not
it's uncirculated so care ok what do you
mean uncirculated if you ever if you've
ever done coin collecting oh I'm an
uncirculated coin what is gonna go with
that never touched human hands don't
even look at it I opened it did you
touch it doesn't it valuing there's a
value increase if you've never even
looked at it I don't know this is never
even if I'm made of like heavy plastic
so I'm not too concerned I won't touch
it I'll just I'll just sort of now you
got me all nervous now I feel like
something terrible's gonna happen if I
touch it it's probably actually does
feel like that hey it just pick it okay
it's lost all of its value now what does
it say this plastic container it says
something approved MGB 2013 no idea but
yeah I mean it's it's like an actual
coin it's got weight to it and stuff
proof coins yes tech full very very
briefly did some claim collecting when I
was much younger just a scam to get me
to pay more money for dude take your
pick claim you just put a dollar coin
for two dollars yes exactly that's what
they do
and then like no but it's it's it's
freshly minted special and has not been
in circulation keeping fans if you keep
it for 200 years it might be worth more
money
alright I live that long reed Johnson 25
dog donation says Kiowa phone do you use
it looks like a pixel to or two XL was
curious as a pixel to XL owner it's a
pixel to non XL 9 X and I love it I have
my favorite phone that I've ever owned
hands down you didn't ask me because the
xl2
heads up to missile XL okay not one -
not the - gotcha
I ordered the two I got the two and it
didn't work the way I wanted to it
wanted it to returned it and my pixel
two actually had like a physical defect
defect and it was enough to the point
where it prevented me from doing like a
proper video review on it hmm so I was
just like all right I'm just gonna
return this and I don't yeah I didn't
really need a new phone at the time so
and my pixel one that I had before this
one had a physical defect known as
spilling beer on it back yes yeah okay
okay let's open this guy up we've only
got two more here this might be
it could be wrong but this might be pup
Shepherds package that he's been
inquiring about I think it is right yay
we have the one-of-a-kind pup Shepherd
t-shirt from goober prints over to it oh
no it's just one just one fairly large
t-shirt pup shirts
oh there's two awesome hardware awesome
hardware for awesome people
it's the pup ship limited-edition pup
Shepherd awesome hardware collab t-shirt
it smells so fresh ah yes it does yeah
never been never been in circulation
that's true until now thanks pop thanks
pop appreciate it man pride large that's
a large okay hey sweet yeah I get one to
wifey sausage - where - awesome cool
thanks man alright

KY remember when you said that it would
be awesome if NZXT makes a motherboard
when the H 700 I launched by the way I
challenged start and finish HTPC before
me for for Paul you should start an HTPC
build and finish it before I finish mine
I should that's what he's saying oh oh
yes now I've made so many HTTP see
videos already I know I'll leave it to
you and it wasn't it funny how you gave
NZXT the idea to make another boy
royalty checks in the mail
should have given them the idea to make
a reasonable power delivery system on it
- for just a reasonable price Jack
Oswald with $5 donation hey guys
hopefully you can figure out something
out of my beer glass suggestion was
awesome from Iowa to check out two
breweries and Cali nice I don't know
what that means wait breweries I says
hopefully you can figure something out
with my beer glass suggests
oh I I don't think we got your severe
glass suggestion we get oh wait oh yes
yes the one it was it was he tweeted me
a ballast point a picture of a ballast
point glass up their brewery and it was
just like one of the tulip ed glasses
okay looks really nice I know I know or
a guy John our merchandise guy can get
pretty much any kind of glass so oh yeah
I'm sure will at some point expand ours
and our glass collection class glass
master I think this is the last package
that we have from real time see here
this might be from stroopwafels oh my
gosh you got stroopwafels you can have
one cuz there's two of them here these
are so good Oh dangerous you you let you
know these you've had these I only have
ever had those on unsure delta flights
yeah right meet you that's the only time
I've ever had a steer and Delta flight
last year I took some short delta
flights from LA up to the Bay Area and
they would give you a stroopwafel yeah
just once to buffle there was a little
waffle shell with like some caramel it's
just a little flat thing and you're
supposed to take it and put it on top of
your coffee and then the coffee like
warms it up and makes it soft but
they're very delicious I want one right
now to puffles you want one - I would
totally eat one right now all right
before we continue on I was talking to
Brian from VPS customs recently he said
that he did send me something in my p.o
box which I thought I was going to open
up tonight but it appears that it may
still be in my Peele box Brian so don't
you miss don't be discouraged I'll let
you know next to my visit it
next up quite a few more donations I'm
gonna try to go through these a little
bit quicker handle it hi long with the
five dollar donation I maintain that we
need a dedicated pimp my PC video once
weekly I apologize dream on switch to
come say this hey that's that's a tall
order but it's been suggested before I
might do something similar to put my PC
on the channel he says oh I love y'all
hey long out Thank You head lapel on
Michael the vote devote a $5 says just
wanted to say
love you guys Sephora Janice weakly
thank you man cool that feels good to be
loved kind of you say we appreciate that
and ruch wire thought I have Canadian
dollars
I'm a Quadro noob but I may use it for
Ark survival evolved server
thanks anyway Cheers that is interesting
I have not heard of a Quadro card
specifically used to run a server I'm
not sure if that would be taken
advantage of
I mean a Quadro is like you know you got
a lot of parallel processing going on
but you need software that's able to
take advantage of it do you think are
just don't really have too much of an
issue running servers yeah especially
you listen man I don't see why you would
need a gaming card I feel like a server
would be that's true would be less
concerned with its actually rendering
stuff and more answering with player
processor and updating stuff memory yeah
so I don't think you would need a Quadra
for that Andrew I'm sorry if we're not
we're kind of Quadro noobs juice no do
some more research maybe okay MB 67
lenticular thank you for your 1 $13.30
on a shoe Kyle I have nothing important
to say other than cheers Cheers
Paul hope all goes well for you and
yours thank you very much sure and
you've been sending a very very
picturesque sunset photos recently Thank
You poeple who gave us the damn
stroopwafel doesn't say really
whoever Hegel just says hi Kyle enjoy
this Dutch treat and sorry to Heather
because I do not think it's vegan from
Omar Omar thanks Omar yo Omar whoo
awesome yeah not not vegan definitely
not more for me all right um Aaron
Porter $5 donation the GPP G first
program talked about in my half
I would also mean partner program but
also mean that companies like issues
couldn't sell ROG motherboards for Intel
and AMD as well what
I thought about that I didn't realize I
didn't know if it was only concerning I
really included GPUs or mm-hmm
like I could see how it could be
construed that way but that would make
zero sense to me from Nvidia's videos
standpoint what benefit would they get
from somehow restricting motherboard
sales right which is a area of the
market that they don't even deal with
yeah it would simply generate negative
publicity for them mm-hmm so I don't see
that happening
I mean hobby graphics who knows maybe
but I doubt that would happen but thank
you for your donation
Cody gunts with five dollars and 55
cents traveling was watchdog of
violation beasts odds are blue screens I
was my 2400 it stuck with all up-to-date
driver's updates and BIOS during
playback and gaming hmm CPU watchdog
violation he says he's running it stock
anything usually I get those when
attempting to overclock
or something like that but yeah that
would be something that I would probably
try to report either directly back to
AMD or to my motherboard manufacturer
because if it's something that is
repeatable and happening consistently
then they would probably be interested
in getting some some system logs and
stuff from you to find out if that's
something that they need to issue a fix
for I haven't heard of that specifically
though so yeah yeah I'm sorry Cody
though hopefully that is fixable with an
update next type is Dominic frosene $10
donation Kyle's gonna read this cuz
they're you guys so good isn't it isn't
it just so good you guys are awesome
both you helped me so much with my first
build can't thank you enough
next rounds on me you're welcome dummy
thanks man thank you
Congrats on the first build that's
always a nice milestone be quick
Zach II quit Zach 1499 was wondering
what ultra-wide you would recommend for
a 1080i having a hard time picking one
out an ultra-wide well we just talked
about this right the Acer predator X 32
or x 34 well this is X 34 which is a
little bit older so I might be able to
get a good deal on it or the 35 is a
little bit newer right or the new g3 4 8
q PG 3 4 8 q was that right yeah they're
all very expensive if you want ultra
wide and a good pairing force nati is
gonna be 30 40 34 40 by 1440 if you want
it all that what do you think then all
they're all they're all over $1000 yeah
which sucks maybe wait for like a Black
Friday deal or something if you can
swing it if you can wait that long
pup Shepard 10 bucks one shirt for Paul
one shirt for Kyle nice I cleaned up my
Twitter so no more visible naughty stuff
or naughty bits literally naughty bits
I'm into your Twitter you know went back
in the day I know I know the bits you're
talking about also my youtube / Raz
Grizz 359 has been cleaned from the
start well that's good to know
and that'll be won't be promoting any
not-safe-for-work material on my
chesticles
thanks to your shirt thanks bub
appreciate it man thank you about eggski
55 norwegian Crona is it possible to
make a PC that can play pong cannot play
pong wait I cannot play pong why is that
a question I don't know I want to make a
PC that can't play pong why would you
ever want to do that
that's a calculator by a calculator
that's a computer can't sleep on a
SmartWatch yeah that's true
so yes the answer to question is yes it
is possible very very possible
Steve blumquist $10 thank you for always
being about the beer and the hardware is
it worth it to upgrade to rise in now or
wait for rising - I would wait I do
virtually virtualization work from time
to time but
in no rush yes there's been especially
few no rush
yeah hang out for a month but then a
half and see what the rising to lunch
does for the market yeah and who knows
maybe you'll you might find some deals
on first-gen rise and once rise and two
comes out if that's turns out to be
enough for your needs thanks B but the
109 Norwegian krone oh what's your
opinion on singularity computers is
pretty quick builds that he does all the
time
prefer plural co-chairs I'm not familiar
with singularity
I am his name his first name is I knew
it it's escaping me right now yeah he
does amazing builds he documents them
very well on his channel does a lot of
talking over what he's done with the
custom set up Sidious put on there and I
believe he is now also launched a store
where he sells products directly I was
actually in a Twitter conversation with
him gosh I feel like this was a year or
two ago and I think I I think I fell off
and I see we were talking about possibly
doing something together and I think I
completely my fault stopped stopped
communicating which I'm very bad at a
lot of the times yeah he does really
good work these builds are insane
they're they're amazing Dez Jones $5
donation my current rig is dead in the
water since my GPU died so can't use it
shadow to fit out until next month we'll
send Plus releases or suffer GPU price
gouging there's no indication that the
Zen + release will have any impact on
GPU pricing so yeah GP price gouging
it's pretty much it's just a decision
that you have to make for yourself right
now it's a crappy one I tend to lean
towards telling people no don't spend
ridiculous overpriced prices on
something that should cost way less
money but I understand that some people
are in a situation where they just want
a game and maybe even saving for it for
a while or maybe you just have a decent
amount of X of
you know disposable income and you can
afford it in which case you know go for
it it's gonna suck in a year or two when
prices come back down but you know it's
just just understand that you're
overpaying for what you're getting you
can still get like a 1080i in the
meantime for relatively cheap and and
enjoy 1080p gaming like pretty smoothly
yeah if you're looking at 1080 T eyes
though and they're plus $1,000 then
definitely look at Titans because Titans
are better and they're often in some
situations can be cheaper I think a lot
more memory all right Guido Sarducci $5
donation so I guess I missed sight a
because I'm in the hospital
I'm sorry as such a misspent my PC
submissions currently watching side B
live on my my phone we all right man I'm
sorry you're in the hospital I wish you
a quick recovery and no worries for
missing side a I'm glad you're able to
catch us first I'd be though maybe he's
like in the hospital just like
vandalizing though maybe he's not
even a patient that's possible could
just be I want to assume that an asshole
just dicking around like with
the nurses and you know that would be a
weird jerking it in the pastime into the
doctor's office I'll do two you're a
bastard anyway thanks for the donation
does Jo five dollars what are your
thoughts on this monitor the LG 3 2 TK 8
v 0 G black 30 1.5 inch qHD 1440p 5
millisecond 144 Hertz Nvidia g-sync
gaming monitor IMO best gaming mod or
out right now for eight hundred and
fifteen dollars that's what it's selling
for a new agreement 31 inch 140 so or
Hertz geez I have a couple monitors this
size that are 4k and you can get a 4k
monitor this size even with decent color
reproduction so yes I don't know
let's see the color range cuz I mean IPS
Oh gtfo
sixteen point seven million colors so
probably not so that would probably be
your dance might cheat your downfall in
this is that I'm not positive it might
might not be seeing but it just
definitely doesn't have the same it
doesn't have the billion color range
it's not a 10-bit you know qHD sphere
lighting whatever sphere lighting is
okay I'm not seeing the panel technology
advertised here which probably means
it's TN so you're probably not going to
get really good color reproduction here
you're gonna get really good refresh
rate and I'm gonna get g-sync VA that's
a VA panel so that's kind of in between
so it'll be a little bit better than its
yen but yeah it does seem like a very
solid set of features for a gaming
monitor just bear in mind that your
purchase is gonna be largely dependent
on what you want to do with it
so um if you're gaming then then cool if
you're gonna be doing gaming and content
creation or something like that then you
might also take a look at some of the
other options that are 4k that better
color reproduction but you're not going
to have the refresh rate the my frame
the 4k Asus PB whatever that I got yeah
depends on if you're prioritizing gaming
or productivity okay jj5 cool one $4.99
I'm back missed you guys go to
Disneyland on Sunday come say hi I'll be
wearing my new shirt I just ordered Kyle
you can do that you haven't passed right
I do not know you did have a pest we
don't have passes you just go well we
the last time we went was like the first
time in like a year - oh I thought I've
seen you go a few times but well I went
to like Universal Studios and stuff
that's that's where that's Rome but but
cool um thank you picking up a shirt is
expensive now it's like a hundred and
twenty bucks or something to go for a
day ridiculous I think we'd like like
under 100 it was like 90
that depends if you do though maybe
because single being single Park or part
copper oh yeah in Southern California
you can get a little bit of a discount
yeah cool all right enjoy your joy the
happiest region a centres sear on curry
$5 sorry your name there if my PC has an
i-5 2500 K and eight gigs of ddr3 1600
megahertz Ram but also has an asus strix
1080 1070 OC edition how desperate
should I be to upgrade I mean you're
okay for right now I would probably want
to get some more memory at some point
and you might actually have an easier
time getting some ddr3 to add on to that
system if you didn't want to upgrade
that beyond that you're looking at a
platform upgrade which means you'll need
ddr4 and everything so given the price
of memory I would say hold out with what
you got you know cuz that's not a bad
setup especially if the 2500 kg
overclocked a little bit yeah I think
you're fine you're doing just fine
Allen W $5.00 thank you guys for
featuring my build much inspiration
bye-bye your builds first pc built in a
decade keep up the great content Thank
You Allen cool yeah dad we could do that
mean we enjoyed taking a look at your
system thank you for submitting it
Austin Maru five dollars no comment oh
thank you that follow-up he did a
follow-up comment I follow up donation
with a comment that says you guys should
add beer tankards to your store a
tankard like one of the big Stein's with
the the flip eel lid is that what that
is
think tankard I mean I don't know maybe
maybe we could do a like a short special
edition tankard or something oh yeah
yeah one of those looks like a medieval
type of medieval medieval mug
sure you never know this guy's the limit
doubled derp ninety to five Australian
Intel i7 47:10 HQ at 2.7 gigahertz from
3.4 gigahertz with gtx 860m 2 gigabyte
to Intel i7 7700 HQ 2.7 to 3.7 gigahertz
with the GTX 1066 gigabyte is it worth
upgrading need to upgrade
anyway yes yeah that's a pretty big
upgrade he needs to upgrade it's a very
very big boost in the GPUs performance
as well as a pretty decent boost in the
CPUs performance we're not having prices
listed but you said you need to upgrade
so go for it if you want to fork out 400
investing you know investing in a laptop
with the 1066 gig is a lot more price
effective than investing in an actual
1066 gig right now - so yeah I don't
want to consider that and just buying
like a set of peripherals connected to
the laptop microdrive $5 just bought a
pint glass from you guys thanks you're
welcome thank you
Cheers finger pistols Brandon bye great
with dish pounds what monitor do you
recommend under 200 great British pounds
there are a lot of panels in that range
in that sort of entry-level budget area
that I I would go for 2560 by 1440
resolution I would go for a better panel
than TN which means preferably IPS yeah
maybe VA and I would go for did I say
27-inch 27-inch 25 - 27 inch 27-inch
2560 by 1440 and then get the highest
refresh rate that you can afford you
should be able to find the 60 Hertz for
sub $200 yeah and maybe even one that
supports free sink but that would only
be useful for you to you for you if you
had an AMD graphics card that's true
