Walmart's new line of overpowered gaming
desktop PCs and I was basically just
trying to speculate and infer as much
about these builds as possible with
relatively little information just
looking at the online product pages the
the incomplete spec lists and so forth
but today we actually have the real deal
here in our studio I purchased the $1400
PC that I was looking at online in the
first video and brought it here so that
we could take a closer look at these
gaming rigs from Walmart and figure out
what they're really made of I don't know
what to expect really it's still sealed
in the box like I just hope I didn't
waste $1,400 on one video the thermal
take a 500 aluminum TG mid-tower
features a sleek aluminum front panel
and two four millimeter tempered glass
panels for breathtaking views enjoy 420
and 360 rad support at the front and top
respectively and breeze through
installation with the dismantle of all
modular design step up your case game is
the a500 aluminum TG and click on the
link below for more info all right let's
do it let's get this sucker I have to
wait hold on are there any ok you can't
see my shipping address right why am I
asking you that now you're definitely
gonna be looking for it if you weren't
already I'm pretty sure we're fine I
purposely oh that's that's an address
that I almost showed you guys all right
I purposely didn't unbox it before
filming I wanted to get this on camera
because some of you guys might be
curious how exactly this all works from
a big company when ordering a gaming PC
from a big company like Walmart let's
see here so far it's pretty standard to
most big system integrator experiences
alright cool so we've got sort of okay
that's that's clean looking and then on
the other side it's giving me a water
cool vibe here hopefully that means the
temperatures are good I'm gonna tilt it
down so you can see this is the first
thing I see when I open the box oh oh
hey this is interesting
it's a QuickStart guide this is actually
not very special I'm just not used to
unboxing pre-built and for the record I
should have said this already but this
is the dtw one this is their lowest end
gaming desktop which is still a hefty
1,400 bucks but for that $1,400 you get
a core i7 8700 six core CPU and the gtx
1070 from nvidia we don't know who the
ad and board partner is i speculated
that it was gigabyte you guys should
definitely watch the part 1 video if you
haven't yet because then you could see
how correct or incorrect i was at all
my predictions Hey look look at this
foam I like this I like the foam
packaging it's very heavy-duty seems
like it was well taken care of in
shipping there's virtually zero damage
on the actual outside box as well all
right what's what's in here we've got oh
hey look at this
RGB we get an RGB strip in there or some
sort of RGB element with instructions
LED light controller get that very
interesting okay I wasn't expecting like
an actual RGB remote in here with an AC
cord of course all right here we go guys
y'all ready for this all right sorry I
get excited when I undressed new toys
okay you guys can see it better than I
can right now what does it look like
here hey it looks looks pretty good yeah
you know you got okay so you got
tempered glass tempered glass confirmed
on the front and left side panel there's
none on the back there's just a regular
regular steel side panel on the other
side which I would prefer anyway and on
the top here there's three USB 2.0 ports
at least they look like 2.0 ports
because they're all black there's no
blue ones and you get a power and reset
at the top mic and headphone jacks and
that's all for the front panel pretty
straightforward I would have liked to
see USB 3 well we'll test the speeds
just in case or well actually check the
wired connections to see if one of those
might be USB 3 but it doesn't look
likely and we've got some over powered
branding on the front there and on the
side beside is is is large large
branding on the side but it's it's
tasteful it actually isn't it's not like
a terrible looking logo or anything
taking a closer look at this front panel
here it's fully tempered glass you get
three included 120 millimeter fans at
the front and there's a very thin sort
of ventilation area going around the
three edges the bottom the right side
and the top the left side is completely
closed off because the tempered glass
side panel here sort of extends past the
actual frame and it meets the front
panel so there's no gap there but
there's a thin a very thin gap along
these three edges so it kind of looks
like the front panels floating a little
bit but I'm a little concerned that this
gap is way too narrow to let a lot of
healthy air flow in those front fans are
gonna be choked for sure of course I'm
not going to validate this until a
future video where I actually do proper
testing once the dust settles for
Thanksgiving breast assured there will
be a follow-up testing video oh and side
note I just realized that there's zero
dust filtration at the
whatsoever so prepare to clean this
thing often all right let's take the
tempered glass side panel off a very odd
position to remove a side panel from I'm
sorry PC you should not have dropped the
soap right actually before I take the
side panel off I'm gonna change the
camera angles because now that we're
done with the unboxing we don't need
these wide shots anymore so let me
tighten it up for you all right that's
better okay you guys ready to see it
me too let's do it whoa hey interesting
interesting okay all right so before we
dive into the specifics here let me
quickly go over the full spec list like
I said core i7 8700 so you get a 6 core
desktop CPU we have a gtx 1070 which is
confirmed from gigabyte more on that in
a sec there's 16 gigs of DDR 4 memory at
24 44 speed according to the spec sheet
which is also kind of peculiar and we
have a 256 gig SSD with a 2 terabyte
mechanical hard drive let's take a
closer look at this build though I want
to start with the cable management
because that's the most glaringly
obvious thing that's standing out to me
right now
so oK we've got we've got USB 3.0 here
in the first video I thought this might
have been custom sleeved extensions
clearly I was wrong and later on I I
realized that yeah it probably isn't
that interestingly they have it just
routed right over the video card proper
cable routing would say to put this
behind the motherboard tray to avoid
this kind of treachery also quick side
note now that we're in here I can't
confirm that the USB ports of the front
panel are 2.0 none of which are 3.0
because I can see that there's a 2.0
header right here and the only USB 3
connector on the motherboard is going to
the rear expansion card I thought this
was a PCIe card in the first video but
it's clearly just a USB 3 adapter and it
allows for a type-c USB 3.0 connection
at first I thought that was USB 3.1
maybe even Gen 2 but it seems to just be
USB 3 also oh ok single what is that a
single 4 pin power plug 4 for our
graphics card which is not even plugged
in all the way I swear to you watch
watch I'm gonna take single finger then
oh you know there's a retention clip
right that's supposed to stay on there
one finger disconnected definitely
wasn't even clipped this would not boot
right out of the box I don't know if
that happened in shipping or if whoever
was building this just bailed um but I
it has to be the Builder because there's
no way once it's clipped in its second
come out in shipping maybe it could you
guys have any experience with that let
us know but that's that's I guess a
strike
whatever we're not we're not keeping
score here but that is a little
concerning that the graphics card power
was not even plugged in so yeah is a CPU
plugged in yes okay good by the way the
CPU is only using a four pin I should
say the motherboard only has a four pin
connector for your 12 volt EPS for the
CPU there is an additional 4 pin
connector coming off your power supply
but your motherboard only supports 4 pin
which is fine because you're not
overclocking this and you can't
overclock the 8,700 anyway so that's all
fine there the rest of this cable
management though is it is kind of
sloppy it's kind of sloppy for sure the
24 pin cable spines not much you can do
there but the two SATA cables are really
loose they could have been taught a lot
more taught and their zip tied to the
cable the power cable for the video card
which is just kind of bizarre and then
this thing is just kind of hanging off
that could have been cinched down a bit
the zip ties aren't even like fully
tightened like this kind of looks like a
rush job to me now granted this is a
very simple system so it's not very
difficult to go in and rearrange the
cables redo the cable management
yourself but again if you're new to PC
building which you might be if you're
considering buying a pre-built system
from Walmart then you aren't gonna
really want to deal with that you're not
gonna want to crack the side panel open
in the first place so it's just a little
disappointing I would think for most
people to see this system brand new and
the cables just kind of all over the
place then again a lot of people might
not even notice they wouldn't even know
good from bad cable management they just
might think this is what a gaming PC
looks like so I don't know you guys let
me know what you think the layout of
this case is pretty straightforward
there is a power supply shroud which is
sweet there is a rubber grommet in the
shroud as well which they did not use
they could have easily used that for the
the video card cable again and then you
have the sort of interesting like grid
pattern on the front of the power supply
shroud that gives you a view of your
mechanical drive maybe for additional
airflow or something like that
breathability I think it's funny that
the case actually has the the lettering
HDD 3.5 inch just kind of stamped into
the side why isn't there any printing
right here that says motherboard just
seems racist now the CPU cooler as I
predicted in the first video is not an
Intel stock cooler which is good at the
very least it's not that but it is still
a fairly entry-level kind of dinky
looking cooler
it's a small heatsink tower there with a
92 millimeter fan it looks like I really
get the sense that Walmart just tried to
get the absolute cheapest aftermarket
cooler they could find that would
prevent the cpu from overheating but
would save them the most coin and again
will verify all this stuff in a
follow-up video I also wonder how loud
that fan is now this is a mid tower
chassis so it can support full-size ATX
boards but the board in here is actually
micro ATX to be exact it's a gigabyte h3
10 ms2 so it's using the h3 10 chipset
from Intel which is totally fine you
don't need an overclocking chipset with
an 8700 anyway but it's micro ATX it
seems like it's only got one full size
by 16 PCIe slot which again is probably
fine for most people buying this system
one thing that concerns me with this
board though is that it is a thin
profile micro ATX board so it's not
quite as wide as most em ATX boards on
the market so there's only two DIMM
slots on there that's also because
Walmart's cheap and they're cutting
corners wherever they can so there's
only two DIMM slots on this micro ATX
board and you only have one stick of
ddr4 memory that's populating it so
you're running single channel which
optimally you want to be running dual
channel when you can the only way to do
that in this case would be to buy
another one of these sticks this is in a
data 16 gigabytes of a data ddr4 2400
speed 2400 makes a lot more sense and
the 2444 that was listed on their
website so good to know single channel
memory good job Walmart and obviously
only having two DIMM slots does limit
how much you can expand your memory in
the future although since you already
have a single 16 gigabyte stick if you
pop another 16 gig stick in there I mean
32 gigs is more than enough for the
majority of gamers 16 gigs is an effort
for most gamers these days take a look
at the video card here it is a gigabyte
gtx 1070 win force OC 8 gigabyte card
which is exactly the model that i
speculated it was in the first video
it's a cheap card it's one of the
cheapest if not be cheapest gtx 1070
from gigabyte that you can currently
find on the market but that doesn't mean
it's a bad card it's very basic it has a
very cheap plastic shroud there's no
backplate obviously zero frills but it's
still a gtx 1070 at the end at the end
of the day and thank god it's not a
blower style fan or cooler it's got a
twin fan design with a heatsink for all
intents of bourbon says it looks pretty
solid apart from the 8700 i would say
this is the next strongest part if not
the strongest part in the entire system
so that's good it's just a matter of
cool it can stay with this relatively
basic cooler especially with those front
fans being more or less choked for
airflow the pretty much covers it for
this side of the system so why don't I
turn it around and we'll take a look at
the backside oh you know technically we
only got halfway through a cable
management scene because there's more
over here
everyone say prayer here it is I haven't
seen this yet boom hey that's actually
not bad that is a lot better than I was
expecting this actually looks a lot
better than the other side which usually
doesn't happen you know that they made
good use of tie-down points it's not
like they really used or abused that
power supply shroud much either they
could have just stashed a lot more junk
down there but it looks relatively empty
and most of the cabling has been done
properly behind the motherboard tray I
like the generous CPU cooler cut out -
very nice now I can't remember I might
have said that that RGB remote that we
saw earlier was actually for an RGB
strip
I was wrong it's actually for the fans
the fans are RGB this is an RGB control
hub and we can see that the three fans
in the front and the rear fan are
connected to it so until you get for RGB
fans all 120 millimeters and we'll test
that out in just a bit but a little
module there right next to that you have
two trays for two and a half inch drives
held in place by single thumb screws
actually a pretty common and appreciated
design I like that design but their SSD
has been mounted down here I'm actually
gonna unplug the cable so I can take it
out and show y'all I mounted it down
here in the drive cage might as well and
plug the OE actually sorry this is the
mechanical Drive up top so we get a
Toshiba 2 terabyte you know is your
basic 7200 rpm mechanical hard drive
that's fine and then you get an a data
is s three one six looks like it's using
3d TLC man I don't know if you can buy
this or if this is just something for
system integrators but it is a 256 gig
say there ev3 six gigabit per second SSD
no idea if it's any good they did is a
pretty reputable brand though if it was
just some random no-name Chinese
knockoff name that I didn't recognize
I'd be a little concerned now I saved
the potentially worst part about this
build for last and that's the power
supply because as I mentioned in the
first video it's pretty well known among
enthusiasts that system integrators will
often skimp like crazy on their power
supply
just put a dirt cheap unit in there in
order to make a good portion of their
margins and unsuspecting buyers will be
gaming on their systems six months to a
year to two years down the line after
they're purchased and then
boom BAM or whatever the sound of frying
power supply makes will be heard and
potentially damaged more than just the
actual unit it could harm the rest of
your system too because it's all
connected to the psu so I actually want
to take it out I'm gonna uninstall it
really quick because I can't really see
what brand it is because of the PSU
shroud so give me a sec all right let's
get this guy out of here what do we got
what is this great wall what the hell is
great wall I've never heard of that
probably some Chinese company or
something 500 watts it's 500 watts for
an eighty seven hundred and a GTX ten
seventy I mean it boils down to just the
reliability of the components that are
inside and the efficiency rating and it
looks like it does say 80 plus there's
no badge there's not even like a basic
80 plus badging you are it's probably
too cheap of unit to even afford a badge
but it does say 80 plus in small text
here so I guess it does have some small
amount of decent efficiency but that's
only one part of what makes a good power
supply just because it has 80 Plus on
there doesn't mean it doesn't mean
anything really we still have to find
out exactly what components are being
used inside and just how how haphazardly
made this unit was so again guys this is
exactly what I expected from a system
integrated pre-built is is a really
really weak power supply now this system
as a whole I guess you know what let's
let's wrap this up really quick give me
a sec I'll turn it around all right you
know we haven't done yet we haven't
turned the system on just to make sure
that it works so all right it powers on
oK you've got you've got LED colors
right no oh wait I got to I got to pull
the tab out huh noob all right there it
is okay cool you can do fun things no
changes color ah cool hey addressable
RGB look at that not bad okay so what's
the deal with this thing now I'm not
gonna give a full review and say this is
a review because it's not I haven't even
tested the actual system we still don't
know what the CPU temperatures are like
if this cooler is any good what the GPU
temperatures are like if you're getting
any intake from those front fans but
what we can say is that there are
certain Hardware shortcomings here right
you you don't get USB 3.0 on the front
panel you're limited to single channel
memory out of the box your graphics card
might not even be plugged in when you
get the system because somebody else
built it and you have quite frankly the
type of power supply that literally
keeps me up at night that's not to say
that there aren't any good things about
this system it's
for what you're getting for a core i7
hexa core CPU like the 8700 which just
hauls ass in games and the gtx 1070 you
also only have one warranty to deal with
should anything go wrong with this
system if you build your own rig you've
got eight nine ten maybe different
warranties different vendors that you
have to contact should any part fail but
with this you just go to Walmart if the
fan breaks the CPU EFTS up whatever it
doesn't matter you just go to one person
and that's a lot easier for a lot of
people the last pro I can think of off
the top of my head which isn't really a
pro to me because I enjoy this is you
don't have to build a system yourself if
you just don't have the time or the
knowledge or the know-how you want to
bother with it you just want a PC to
game on and that's fine not everyone
needs to love all the things that I love
although the world would be a better
place if they did so I'll close with
this if you're dead set on buying a
pre-built gaming PC two things one
explore other options there are more
system integrators out there who have
been doing this longer than Walmart has
in fact they've only been doing this for
like a week or two
not all pre belts are built the same so
go check the competition out and see
what they have to offer and to consider
building it yourself it's really easy I
promise you can watch my step by step
guide which I'll link somewhere around
here maybe in the description and if
it's a time thing then make time for it
you know blow the kids off who cares
about the wife they don't matter
you know when it's just you tinkering
with your hardware that's what it's
really all about you know and there's a
whole there's a whole community of
people who do this so if you need help
on how to handle your parts properly I
mean you just ask me I do it all the
time so guys thank you so much for
tuning into this video let me know what
you think of these Walmart pcs in the
comments hustle boys on it if you
enjoyed it and get subscribed for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon
until next time guys have a good one
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
