below what's going on guys welcome back
to the channel hope you're all doing
well today I am with whyphy sauce hi
joining me once again we're gonna be
doing something a little bit different
today if you guys remember a couple
months back we did a 1v1 csgo
challenge where we just kind of went
head to head I had a super slow PC she
had a super fast PC I still won because
I'm awesome and we're gonna be taking
that same sort of formula today but
putting a massive spin on it so
basically with a game that we came up
with is called stack attack stack attack
it's kind of a mesh between a video game
challenge video game 1v1 and a card game
that makes sense right so we're gonna be
playing csgo once again but this time we
have these fun little cards that were
integrating into our gameplay attack
cards right so before the match starts
each player is gonna choose three cards
and each card had a different attack on
it each attack is a little bit different
so some of them hinder your eyesight
ability and you can also extract these
cards on top of each other which makes
it a much stronger attack on the other
player and since we're gonna be having
three cards it can you can stack
anywhere between two and three but we
have to keep in mind that if we do stack
all three cards at once we have no other
attacks for this for the rest of the
match that's right so you have to kind
of use your attacks wisely and and you
don't necessarily need to stack them but
that is an option now most of these
attack cards are our time based so it'll
indicate on each card how long the
effect stays in play before it's
completely discarded there one time used
cards as well other cards in here I
think there's only one or two are not
time-based they're simply there to
incapacitate the player that you're
playing it on until that player
completes a certain task and
and resume playing normally if you do
stack let's say two attacks of different
durations let's say we've got a three
minute and a five minute the entire
effect gets reduced down to the lower or
the shorter duration car oh I should
mention that when stacking attacks that
you need to play them at the same time
basically you can't play one and then
halfway through its duration stack
another attack on top of it they need to
be played simultaneously also to keep
track of the time of each challenge we
have these fancy little cubes that I
found on Amazon links in description
below shameless plug and basically how
it works actually kind of cool I never
seen this before you flip the cube over
on its side and it will automatically
start timing a timer for whatever right
and so at the end of that when the timer
runs out it'll start buzzing you just
flip it back go see your earlier it
resets it and and yeah and then your
attack is done your punishment so to
speak is done so that's kind of the gist
of it but you wanna go over the cards
now and kind of the audience what they
are yeah definitely what so let's talk
about these we've got eight cards here
now remember Heather and I are only
gonna be using three cards each which
means two of these are gonna get
discarded and will not be seen for the
rest of the match so the first card we
have here is alien invasion and with
this card you basically have to switch
out your mouse for a trackball and it's
a three minute challenge so I've never
used a trackball for any game Natalie so
it's called the alien vision because the
trackball we got kind of look like an
alien squid it'll all make sense yeah
and then we've got screen glaucoma this
is actually we actually took a couple
pieces of wax paper and cut a hole in
the middle and that's what these things
are in front of our screen so if
somebody gets hit with this attack they
have to flip the wax paper over their
actual screen and it significantly
reduces their their field of view and I
hope don't pick this one high the next
card we got is cottonmouth not what it
sounds like
if you get this card you have to
completely stop what you're doing no
matter if you're in the middle of a
battle and you have to chug a beer and
you can't continue playing until you
finish the beer completely yep so
obviously there's no time limit on it
it's really up to you however fast you
can show the beer you're chugging
ability is the time limits the best way
to start the morning drinking beer yeah
I know we've got flashbang that's
basically impaired impairs your vision
and hearing so we have an eye patch
whoever gets hit with this attack has to
wear an eye patch it's a three minute or
I'm sorry five minutes and they have to
ditch their headset and replace them
with the sound of ear ringing noise
whatever that sound is it's like a
terrible piercing like you know bars and
tone type noise for a whole five minutes
yell time for three minutes which is
gonna be yeah and then also you know
bear in mind after your time is up you
still have to use the keys to unlock
your handcuffs that adds additional time
and then we've got a finger fusion
pretty self-explanatory oven mitts
you have to put on two oven mitts one on
each hand of course and and and now in
try and just try yeah war is lava I
think we all remember playing this game
as kids even as adults yeah basically
your chair is melted and the floor is
lava and the only safe place is to be on
your desk so you have to be sitting on
your desk for three minutes or laying on
your desk you just have to be physically
your whole body doesn't physically on
the desk and then finally we've got
paralysis so if you're affected by this
bloody attack you basically have to take
your timer cube and balance it on top of
your head for three minutes
and yeah you'll have to actually game
now practicing without it falling down
if it does happen to fall down the time
keeps going it doesn't reset or anything
but you do have to scramble to put it
back on your head until that three
minutes is up
so those are all the attack cards like I
said before YC sauce and I will be
choosing three attack cards each two of
them will be left out and discarded for
the rest of the game and the way we
decide who picks their attack cards
first is by rolling a die the person who
rolls the higher die gets to decide
which player chooses the first attack
card so let's say I get the higher
number
and I decide wifey sauce is going to
choose the attack part first so she'll
choose one attack part of her choice
she'll pass the deck to me I'll choose
two two in a row of my choice before
handing it back to her she'll choose her
final two attacks and then it'll go back
to me and I'll choose my final attack as
well make sense I think so I think we're
I think we're ready to roll the dice a
die of course I will let the lady go
first you can roll into this wonderful
pie ten which by the way we will be
using this at the end of this match
because the loser will have to have a
pie thrown in their face true story
why do you think ahead you go get type
pipe in just because I love pie so much
when do I ever eat pie Heather I roll it
and we get a Greek dammit
will you get a 3/8 Wow really middle of
the road sorry pretty grim hasn't even
started yet and I get a four I think I'm
gonna have you choose the first attack
card why thank you so I will pick my
first two attack cards in a row now you
get to choose your final two attacks oh
god I hate you you're gonna hate me more
early by the way we have not wifey sauce
and I have not tried out any of these
attacks ourselves we had Kris be our
guinea pig and sort of decide what the
time limit should be for each one so we
don't really know how will personally be
affected by any of you any of these
attacks Gavin
okay okay all right and we will discard
these two cards and that's that so we
have our weapons we have our weapons and
we are ready to use them I think so
let's go ahead and man our battle
stations and may the best player win oh
this is the beer that we have to chug or
that someone has to potentially chug
it's a corona extra and it is a tall can
24 fluid ounces mmm it's two beers
actually but we put it in one can to
make you feel better
oh really quick before we get started I
did mention that we're doing csgo arms
race the way arms race works is that
wifey sauce and I basically have to
climb a ladder of weapons and whoever
gets to the top first and killed the
opponent to their opponent with the
golden knife is the overall winner turn
the test you're getting to find the face
I don't know you never know though you
never know what these sorts of things so
I will just have to see how it goes
you ready no yeah that was a yes alright
I'll take you up take you on impact ah
stop no physical fighting it's just a
video game
ow
alright alright the match starts in
three two one go so right from the start
I'm feeling pretty good obviously I know
what cards heather has and that makes me
a little bit nervous because I'm
definitely scared of at least one or two
of them kyle is way better at video
games than I am and then we have these
attacks that we're playing on each other
I'm already accepting that I'm getting
some pie in my face later oh my God
we're so bad at this oh my god oh I
think was real oh my gums were a little
reloading oh my god oh across the map oh
my god this is impossible seriously I
suck at this game
at this rate I won't have to use any of
my attacks oh my god I'm so freakin bad
at this game so it's still still pretty
early on scores three two one you know
complete danger yet
you just got FAMAS in the ass so we just
started the game and he is already like
taking my ad but I keep die he's
leveling up I'm still a loved one like I
don't know how I'm gonna make it through
these attacks man like I'm already I've
lost hope of re lost Oh
oh my god are you serious okay
No how dare you how dare you kill a
helpless man drinking beer
oh crap beer - I mean I love beer and
all but that's too early brother oh my
god are you
oh my god I have no worse fucking luck
how is this happening
yes okay finally oh my god
all right game on bitch oh my god
seriously he just finishes beard that
like was not I feel like that wasn't
even like five seconds I only killed him
once I still got two attacks sugarplum
hope you pull away ha
can you already taste that pie yeah I'm
hungry
give it to me come on where you at oh my
god
do you know where I am No
you say you didn't know who I was
yeah I was following your dick I won't
do it again I promise
what a combo I'm thinking how the hell
is this gonna work oh okay all right
alien invasion finger fusion timer for
three minutes so a bitch okay I knew
this is coming and nothing could have
prepared before come on get in the USB
port I'm go the mints oh no no this is
this is impossible
this is totally impossible this stack is
definitely paying off like I just got a
few kills and I'm already a few levels
higher from the very beginning when we
were picking our cards like I knew like
I have one of those in this like I know
that they were gonna suck
I want a Kyle to have them it's what
could make those miss worse this
freaking trackball this combo is ruining
my game I mean the sensitivity on the
trackball is so low and you can barely
spend it with the mitts and you can't
even control movement really so both my
aim and my movement are totally off
combo shits scream walk home for you
screen o'clock home was awesome I mean
you don't even really need any other
attack to stack on top of it it's just
it just performs on its own so and I
think it did pretty well
oh my god camping fucking
oh my gosh Queen Illuma freaking suck I
can't tell if it's Kyle when my gun
moving like I don't know where anything
is right now wait oh my god I'm so
nervous right now that's right Oh
oh my god
oh my gosh yeah yeah that's me I'm done
okay thank God oh my god okay back to
zero where you ask
oh my god yeah I gotta get one more kill
you're at 16
no no if I have to get one more I have
to win the match by by killing it with a
knife or a knife or whatever when I make
that line there me nah know
[Laughter]
shit your vision has been restored I see
jail time she's catching up I'm close to
winning I have more tack cards I'm gonna
play them because at this point if I
don't use them I lose them my god I did
not play that at the right time I should
have waited till I can see you no idea
where I am
I know she's my wife but why can I not
stab this woman yes I think I could have
really stood a chance if he didn't play
lava while I had the handcuffs on wait a
minute oh I should mention that when
stacking attacks that you need to play
them at the same time
basically you can't play one and then
halfway through its duration stack
another attack on top of it they need to
be played simultaneously bottom minute
hey you cheated what do you mean you
stashed your lava card on top of the
handcuffs not at the same time huh not
the same time to do that didn't I
shit what do you say anything sooner I
don't think about it - so wait so what
does that mean does that mean like my
win is negated that neither of us get
pies now so so both of us skip pies but
all right guys it's gonna wrap it up for
now thank you so much for watching let
us know what you think of stack attack
down in the comments below if you have
any ideas for future attacks blow that
shit up until next time have a good one
delicious in the worst way I think I
think that's a wrap
No
