announcement for y'all but I'm gonna try
to keep it quick due to the increasingly
short attention spans on the web in fact
when ARPANET was first developed in the
1960s way this isn't helping so in case
you guys haven't heard the news I will
be attending twitchcon this weekend
which is the streaming platform second
annual convention held in beautiful San
Diego California in celebration of this
momentous occasion I'll be hosting my
own twitchcon and chill live stream that
I'll be broadcasting from my air B&amp;amp;B
near the event so hopefully the
bandwidth there doesn't suck or else I I
don't know periscope on the stream I
will be building a high-end gaming PC
for no other reason than knowing that
you'll watch it actually there's more to
it than that i'll also be building in
support of the Children's Hospital of
Los Angeles raising money via my
campaign page on extra life gorg we're
one hundred percent of all contributions
will go straight to the colors you just
had to bring the kids into this dingy
cow oh but it gets better well not for
me anyway for every five hundred dollars
donated I will be taking shots of
grown-up stuff on stream for your
entertainment and my slow demise
anything for the children bandwidth
willing it'll be the geekiest and most
charitable show of a lifetime and
if you guys get me hung over for day one
of twitchcon i will find and murder all
of you before thanking you for your
generous donations the fun starts on
September 29th at seven o'clock p.m.
pacific and the stream will be broadcast
from this YouTube channel as well as my
new twitch channel bit wit Chi if you
can't make the stream it will live on
YouTube after it's over but you should
really try to catch it live otherwise
it's not really a live stream at that
point is it it's just a long video with
bad editing so that's it guys I put all
the details we just discussed in the
description below and I hope you can all
join me for some good old twitchcon and
chill come September 29th until then
take it easy and I'll see you all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
