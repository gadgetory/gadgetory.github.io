Squarespace the quick and easy way to
build a kick-ass website what's up guys
so today marks the launch of NVIDIA GTX
1050 and GTX 1050 TI a pair of
entry-level graphics cards aimed at
gamers on a budget now the GTX 1050
retails for just 109 USD but today we're
actually gonna be focusing on the $139
gtx 1050 TI because that's the one
nvidia sent me for review yay
unlike the existing pascal cards nvidia
has chosen not to produce a reference
design or founders Edition for these
cards instead reserving all their
inventory for their board partners so
today I'll be testing out the TI model
from the team over at MSI with a sub 150
dollar price point the GTX 1050 Ti is
positioned to compete directly with AMD
SRX 460 and both of these cards are
aiming to capture the budget gaming
market which has been largely dominated
by Nvidia x' Maxwell based gtx 750ti for
the last few years now assuming the
performance of the 1050 Ti is comparable
to that of the rx 460 we can expect it
to provide comfortable 1080p gaming at
modest quality settings or potentially
higher settings for eSports games like
dota 2 and csgo from a quick look at the
specs we can see the 1050 Ti is using a
new ASIC with a GP 107 GPU sporting 768
CUDA cores 48 texture units 32 ROP units
a basin boost clock of 1290 and 1392
megahertz respectively a memory clock of
3504 megahertz and four gigs of gddr5 on
a 128-bit bus offering 112 gigabytes a
second of memory bandwidth also check
out that 75 watt TDP the low thermal
design power explains why our MSI card
here lacks a PCIe connector as it
receives all the juice it needs straight
from the motherboards PCIe slot granted
if we can expect there to be some board
partner variants with an add-on PCIe
connector for increased stability and
Headroom when overclocking the dual slot
card itself measures 7 inches long and
features a plastic black-and-white open
shroud which comes fitted with a single
fan that blows downward onto a small
pipe 'less heatsink in order to move
heat away from the GPU slap all of that
onto a black PCB and bam there's your
graphics card it's a simple no frills
design but
it doesn't look half bad for the money
spent video outs include one - link DVI
hdmi and displayport allowing users to
connect three simultaneous displays the
display engine however is capable of
driving additional panels so board
partners will have the option to release
models with four or more video outputs
should they wish for testing I installed
the card in elixir my sexy silver pc
which you can check out the video of in
case you missed it the rig houses a core
i5 6600 K overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz
on an MSI z170a gaming titanium with 16
gigs of Corsair Dom plats ddr4 at 3000
megahertz an MSI Afterburner I was able
to punch in a 220 megahertz offset on
the GPU core clock and 350 megahertz on
the memory clock landing our max GPU
clock speed at nineteen hundred and
eleven megahertz though this quickly
averaged out to the low 1700s GPU temps
were very tame all the while never
topping 63 degrees Celsius in our
testing all benchmarks were run in 1920
by 1080 which is the suitable resolution
here on Windows 10 with the latest
Nvidia press driver version 370 5.5 7
sadly I don't have an RX 460 on hand so
I wasn't able to pit both cards
head-to-head for this video but let me
know in the comments if it showdown
between these two cards is something
you'd like to see now once we fire up
the benchmark slides be sure to keep a
close eye on the quality settings at the
bottom of the screen as you'll notice I
haven't maxed out everything like I
usually do this time around I lowered
the graphics until we saw playable frame
rates in the 50s and up so the quality
settings listed represent the highest
graphical parameters that the card was
able to run at comfortably this should
also better depicts the kind of gaming
experience where to expect from this
card so with all that said here are the
gaming benchmarks for our overclocked
msi gtx 1050 tia
all righty then
so breaking down the results here and
wrapping things up out of the seven
games we tested which were all triple-a
titles mind you the GTX 1050 t I was
able to run three of them at Ultra
settings which is quite frankly more
than I was expecting the remaining four
games had to be turned down to medium or
high settings in order to be playable
though we escaped the low presets
entirely greatly reducing our risk of
console itis now given how the card
performed in my intensive suite of
titles it's also probably safe to say
that all the big eSports games of today
will run beautifully on the 1050 Ti at
1080p as well overall this card does
pack in some decent value that creates a
very low barrier to entry for PC gaming
for those short on cash and I would
imagine it'll be one of the new popular
choices for the modern budget gamer as
well I for one am already anxiously
awaiting all of those awesome console
killers that will be built around this
capable little card
