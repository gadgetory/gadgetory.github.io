screen leave me alone
oh yeah still resetting from that whew
alright we should be more or less live
to both twitch and YouTube it disappoint
us staying about when that happens it is
I cry every time
so welcome hello this is awesome
hardware episode 154 this is side B
which means we've already finished
broadcasting side a which was on Paul's

can find the link in my description it
was really good we can head over to
youtube.com slash Paul's harder it was
unprecedentedly
great in every way yep I'm forever
changed and you can also check us out on
Twitter on TV slash awesome hardware if
you're watching this on YouTube maybe
for the first time you like hmm what
other platforms could i watch your show
on I think about that all the time
you can check that on Twitch as well but
this is a fun informative and enjoyable
tech tech news show that we do every
single Tuesday at Tuesday what wait I
just said we do it every Tuesday a
Tuesday you didn't know it we do it
every Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. yes Pacific
time yes there's a but okay you're
watching an advertisement I was like I
just like you know laser focus I see but
it's not logged in so why don't we an ad
that's my that's my channel why are
there ads of yoga pants on my videos
what have I done in the Google what is
it because you're logged in and you've
been like checking out yoga it's either
it says hard to better the IP address
that we're connected from here or it is
your account specifically my account oh
all right it's just the first time I've
seen the yoga yoga yoga pants
advertisement on one of my videos I
don't know what to think
well guess uh guess we'll just leave it
to the imagination um all right I'm
getting I'm getting sidetracked here
it's a fun tech so we like to have a
couple drinks and
we encourage you to drink along with us
whether that be if you're of age if
you're of legal drinking age and number
future you want responsibly yeah if you
can if you can only drink you're
responsible or causing alcoholics to
relapse or anything no we don't want
that blood in your room you can do it if
you can do it and have a good time and
it's okay just do it that's okay too
no you don't have to drink to have a
good time but I mean you're cooler if
you do crane to some people know peer
pressure peer pressure got me through a
lot you don't get all peer pressure oh
yeah
um also on the show I guess I should
give an adult language warning sometimes
we do swear so if you have you know kids
around or if you're not comfortable that
sort of thing you've been warned that is
your warning we will just be bad words
effing and essen and being all night
long from here on out crap on the danga
d-dang getting ding a to the poo fill
everybody face and you should buy stuff
from our stores that's the last
announcement or second-to-last
announcement that I'll all plug is we
have stores mine is bit with tech slash
store and I sell a lot of things there
including some of the very fine glasses
that were drinking out of the Tolkien
family bought these already and very
much enjoy them
also Paul store is Paul's Harbor net he
has a lot of great stuff on his store as
well oxblood thumbscrew t-shirt etc we
both go through the same merchandise
guys so it's all very high-quality same
level of quality across across both
across both earth and you will get a
Justin shout out at the end of the show
if you have to purchase anything from
either of us a double Johnson if you
pick up from both stores and the last
thing I'll say is an announcement an
announcement to top off all the
announcements we will be at Comic Con we
mentioned this on Comic Con can it can
San Diego in just a week holy moley
about a week I don't know
next week it's a week from this week a
week from this week it'll be a lot of
fun hope
there'll actually chillin at one of the
the land areas the only land room at the
event which is really the best part of
comic-con and we will be tweeting out
exact date and time of a meet-up
that we'll be doing will do a meet and
greet so if you're going to comic-con go
to the PC gaming area and if you're
going to comic-con you want to meet us
will be around you and we will tweet
some further details as far as actual
meet-up times because we're gonna try to
do that on either Friday or Saturday we
still we're trying to get final
confirmation on that but that's what
really comportment yeah all right let's
just dive right into the news shall we
starting with one of our top stories
here NVIDIA has announced that GeForce
now their game streaming service will be
coming to the shield in the very near
future according to them this is
nautical from hot hardware um GeForce
now as a lot of you guys know is already
available in beta on PC and Mac somehow
it's on Mac currently the wait list is
pretty long though due to the high
demand the service basically lets you
stream Triple A games so that you can
offload all the rendering to Nvidia
servers that way you don't actually need
high-end hardware to run some of the
most demanding games on the market right
now you just need a pretty great
internet connection albeit to handle the
high flow of data but with GeForce now
coming to the shield you don't even need
a PC to play today's most demanding
titles you can just your runnin off your
shield do you have a shield but I don't
have a shield that's one product I never
got I got a field ticket item okay I'm
glad alone on that you know they're
supposed to be really good products some
of the best 4k streaming Android device
stuff that you can come across today and
they're still growing the actual GeForce
now platform it's still very much like I
said in beta at the moment there's only
about 225 games available with so
there's a lot of room for for growth
there but that's cool with with GeForce
now on the shield you
may not even need a gaming PC in 2018 or
when whenever they decide to release it
I would imagine it's um yes you know you
do you absolutely do and I'd also be
curious to see how it performs on the
shield I think it's really gonna depend
on this is peanut brittle that wifey
sauce got before the show and
intentionally left here in order to to
spite you so I would I would be tempted
by it to eat it she has some sort of
ulterior motive here it's a lot easier
to eat when you don't have to talk so
well I'm gonna do both I was gonna yeah
that anyway mmm the more I drink the
better that taste shield streaming is
very effective when you have a gaming PC
in your home though right because then
you can then you can do streaming to the
shield's from it and play on the
controller streaming from your PC yes
yeah that's nine GeForce now right no
okay how did you talk about other uses
for the shield oh yeah right so I guess
with GeForce now coming to shield you
technically wouldn't need that gaming PC
if you still want to run those games but
you should solve gaming PC because
that's the business we're in and if that
goes under we all go under
now we're going under keeping it strong
um all right so just a quick little
update there we can move on to do WCF
Tech's article about a crypto crime that
has yet again yet again happened and one
of the big reasons why I try to stay
away from coin mining and whatnot twenty
three million dollars only twenty three
million dollars was stolen it's not a
big deal gosh the target quarter of 1%
of microns revenue so they would be
somewhat almost close to being mad a
little bit if it was micron they might
have noticed this is the crypto currency
exchange Bank or based in Israel they
were the target criminals stole
approximately 24 or 25 thousand
aetherium coins from them among other
coins one of one of bankers services
includes a wallet with a belt in
exchange service and in the latest
security incident Bank or said that
a wallet used a wallet used to upgrade
some smart contracts was compromised
with attackers making off with over 12.5
million dollars in the theorem 1 million
dollars in NP excess tokens and 10
million dollars in bankers in-house BNT
their bank or tokens or whenever they
got the BNT to the BN t - now since its
bankers owns some of Beng course own
tokens or coins were involved here the
company was able to freeze that BN t but
they can't really do the same with the
NP excess or the etherium and so they're
currently working with other exchanges
to make it more difficult for the
attackers to liquidate the coins that
were stolen the tokens that were stolen
how effective that's gonna be who knows
litecoins charlie lee tweeted kind of
facepalming at this whole situation
particularly in regards to bankers false
sense of decentralization as he called
it as the company can lose and freeze
customer funds if it wants which defeats
the purpose of decentralization so maybe
indicating that it's maybe not the best
place to put your coin or your
investment so far the BN t coin has
fallen 14 percent in value as a result
of this attack and there's no word yet
on who the hell did it so yeah if you're
gonna mine mine wisely guys so Charlie's
it's pointing out that if Bank or has
the ability to freeze their
cryptocurrency then it's not truly
decentralized exactly the currency is
supposed to be right okay make sense but
in this case it allowed them to
potentially save some of their stolen
crypto right and this was all crypto
that was stolen directly from the
company not any customers accounts so
Jeff why but yes it does open up a lot
of discussion for debate as to what
constitutes decentralized decentralized
environment when it comes to mining so
um yep hopefully hopefully no one no one
hears you know I guess you would
exactly all right let's move on to our
next article
this one's from hexxus it's about
Intel's 15 watt whiskey Lake you core
CPUs whiskey Lake whisky Lake these were
spotted by a Twitter link stirrer named
Tom happy sack
I believe he's Thai he's probably one of
my cousin's or something
he's leaked some images of spec sheets
from unreleased laptops showing off some
brand spankin new whiskey like you CPUs
so we can actually expect a launch of
these you series CPUs known as whiskey
Lake that'll be replacing the existing
KB Lake our CPUs very soon so this is
mobile we're talking about mobile yeah
I'm gonna do excited still 40 nanometer
+ + same is the one that's used for ko
cable a car but it's optimized again to
output higher clock speeds within the
same power profile so higher performance
same power config and whatnot we have
the Intel Core i7 85 65 u which is a
whiskey like you CPU that was listed for
course 8 threads 1.8 gigahertz based 4.5
gigahertz turbo it's quite a gap between
the base and boost isn't it but we also
have 8 megabytes of cache 15 watt TDP
this is gonna offer a 500 megahertz
turbo over the I 78550 you which is KB
like our we're also gonna see that same
boost on the core i5 80 to 65 u which is
whiskey like you for core 8 threads 1.6
to 3.9 gigahertz based on boost with 6
megabytes of cache 15 watt TDP so really
we're seeing like some pretty nice turbo
speed gains the turbo clocks on these on
these whiskey Lake CPUs are basically
who's to thank I guess for the
double-digit performance gains we'll see
over KB Lake are according to Intel so
if you're looking for you know a high
speed or a robust mobile solution in the
near future then maybe you want to hold
out for whiskey like you because it
could just be days
or you know at least a few weeks before
before they overtake KB Lake are I'm
turbos I'm turbo frequencies Intel's
doing all they can to 14 nanometer until
until they actually have to shrink it
down
whiskey lake sounds like a good time
though it really does right it kind of
just makes you want to makes you want to
like party with it you're just like yeah
you know what I can get behind that be
fun to have a whiskey lake seems awesome
hardware we should on the launch day we
should just like all we drink is whiskey
I'd be so bad for me so the idea is that
we'd get a really nice whiskey like a
nice scotch so that we would submit very
slowly some sip name is key it would do
it hopefully last us the whole to our
show no he would die we would die but
it's for the fans enjoy they would enjoy
it so I'll take one for the team any
excuse to drink whiskey alright uh next
up we have an article from overclocked
3d dot net introducing Seagate's
new Barracuda lineup of SATA based SSD
so no nvme here but to be honest that's
that's not a that's not bad news or
anything SATA SSDs are still very
relevant most people these days do not
need the the bandwidth or performance
that comes with nvme drives and you can
save quite a bit of money just sticking
with the old SATA two and a half inch
form factor and here here we have
Seagate step it up to the plate finally
kind of following I wouldn't even say
hot on the heels of WD but WD came out
with their their SSDs not too long ago
actually a while back their first one
and and you know what I think I think
it's just the trend like if you're if
you're strictly a hard drive
manufacturer you need to start making
SSDs to stay in the game and to stay
competitive I'm surprised at the form
factor here though the SSD seems like
it's about half the size of a keyboard
Oh it'sit's just a perspective thing
Paul it's not actually that big
it's very large SSD so I'm saying or a
very small keyboard and monitor maybe
this is a tiny keyboard monitor and
mouse
maybe the peripherals are anymore
they're all minis okay so alright so uh
I think I think it makes sense for for
Seagate to to catch on in fact it's
layer it's much larger than this laptop
these are these are marketing stock
photos and imagery postings like you
can't you can't say one two one the
light source seems very awkward here
it's like striking this guy from the
right side but the SSD it's coming from
the left well how do you know there's
not a window on the other side of the
room because it's not reflecting on the
table at all this is wood grain tables
apparently it's because that's because
uh maybe a lacquer finish it's cuz all
the key grips did a very good job of
components dark stain this looks like
it's maybe a walnut or maple you're
getting way too sidetracked right now
Paul you need to focus what all these
green dots what it's what the hell did
this guy just sneeze that all agree with
that it's really weird it's kind of like
why are they there it doesn't really
need to be there why do they go behind
the laptop highly unnecessary and behind
his well they're clearly if you look at
the trajectory they're coming straight
from the window that must be next to the
guy on the right like went to the
trouble here of cutting out his hand
with the with the coffee mug to put some
of the bubbles of green dots behind that
great cuz this is like it's behind that
right yeah but they're in front of him
here and just where the graphic designer
is from seeing yet to put this image
together I'm just I'm very confused
that's it's leaving me maybe there was
too much green stuff in front of his
coffee cup he was I don't know what's
going on
maybe maybe coffee cup is part of the
they want to focus on the coffee cup
more coffee has caffeine which is faster
faster than speed yeah see we just we
just don't get thermo face
we're just don't get their artistic
message alright it's all coming together
forgive us ring slow seagate all right
so two hundred and fifty five hundred
one terabyte and two terabyte capacities
as you might expect these are SATA based
speeds guy
so you're not gonna see anything further
than 540 and 520 megabytes per second
sequential reads and writes
still no word as to whether or not C
gates gonna release some nvme drives in
the near future I reckon it's only a
matter of time because I feel like their
closest competitor right now is WD &amp;amp; w
DS already released some some pretty
nice well reviewed nvme drives these are
gonna come with a five-year warranty the
pricing is fairly competitive for the
250 gig it's gonna be purchasable 470
499 500 gig is one night one 1999 and
the one terabyte is two 29.99
with the two terabytes still pending a
price because it hasn't been released
yet going back to the one terabyte for
229 just did a little quick research
here moment moment ago and it's
basically the same price as WD it's very
competitive with W DS blue SSD which is
also SATA based but it is still $30 more
both of those drives are still $30 more
than crucial z' MX - sorry MX 500 or on
the X 500 now and SanDisk and the
SanDisk Ultra the Centex this ultra is
at 198 less than $200 and the cheapest
one terabyte SSD I could find on Amazon
at the time of filming or broadcasting
was a silicon power silicon power one
terabyte two and a half inch SSD for a
hundred and seventy-five dollars so
trying to save the most coin for the
most capacity some get that's about the
same price as I bought my SanDisk SSD
plus Black Friday
it's a 960 gig one terabyte class which
was like yeah I was like 170 or
something look at work from buck ray or
just a deal before all the NAND and DDR
prices
I feel like tell me about I think you
got either a really good deal and I was
just like a Christmas I got one turbo I
love just the concept of a one terabyte
SSD I know you should know it is so many
things and
I've been using it like it's an external
drive for a bunch of other stuff so
mm-hmm
yeah those one of those things where
it's like I was really glad I bought it
when I did cuz pieces actually went up
yep so oh yeah you can get 500 gig class
SSDs now for less than $100 says they've
been creeping that far down yeah in
price so that's pretty cool so like a 2
terabyte if they can give us a 2
terabyte for 250-300 that'd be that'd be
cool
I'd hit it I mean I'd buy it and then
have sex with it like some adult which
Clubhouse but you're that's what you're
good for Internet's the motion how you
do the sex move the ocean all right
moving on here let's talk about 10 cent
the old Chinese gaming company looking
to take on steam all right giant steam
is currently the leading game client in
the world but China aims to change all
that because they're china and they're
like we look we got like billions more
people than anyone we can we can
dominate anything we want so they're
gonna go after steam globally with their
plans to roll out their client Wii game
which is not cool as steam not cool not
as cool sounding nearly but they want to
take Wii game beyond its home market of
China Wii games gonna challenge steam
first in Hong Kong there will be a
special Hong Kong version of Wii game
that will be released soon it's
currently in the works and and Wii game
actually launched earlier in September
last year it's been widely compared to
steam since its launch however it's much
smaller than steam it only has about 220
games available at the moment obviously
the plan per 10 cent is to increase that
catalog significantly so that it
actually stays competitive
with steam and then expand its catalog
beyond countries that are just in China
so they want to really just make this a
global endeavor the Hong Kong version of
the online store will be available to
oversee users meanwhile though meanwhile
valve they've got plans of their own
they're targeting mainland China with a
Chinese version of steam I didn't even
know that there could be it that there
needed to be a Chinese version of steam
why can't they just use the existing
international version of steam but give
it to chuck oh that's right because
China's government has banned the
international version of steam oh
because it doesn't conform to their
government rules or restrictions so um
yeah I mean it's it's China China is
basically just a place you go to so that
you can do fewer things there's just
lots of websites you can't visit lots of
you know shows you can't watch like John
Oliver and stuff apparently now so I
guess I guess game clients are no
different that's cuz he pay he compared
G Jinping to - Winnie the poo poo right
I mean it's it's a you know the fact
that we've brought this up now probably
now means that we're an amazing China I
would love to get banned by China
yeah we're banned by China I tell
everyone even people like who didn't
know me my live stream is banned in
China should check it out I thought
people would check it out just for that
week there's so much stuff that's banned
in China like how would that make I
don't think that's a stand out claim
that's all I'm saying is this person
agrees is part of the belt and road
initiative like is that is that I don't
know if that's down - that's a part of
it that's all but I don't know there's a
huge there's a huge market to be had in
China and in case you guys didn't know
valve has stated in the past that so
even though there's even though a
Chinese version of steam isn't available
yet dobbs claimed that in the past over
25% of
of its users have designated simplified
Chinese as their preferred language so
at one point probably not too long ago
more than a quarter of steams users were
opting for Chinese for further for the
platform which is all right that's
that's a big chunk clearly there's a
market there and there will only be one
one victor coming out of this octagon of
game gaming frenzy I don't know steam
has China has a lot of catching up to do
because steam is very well established
and they have a shit ton more games than
we game at the moment but I don't know
China China is a it's the biggest
country in the world and they they're
insane
and China's crazy and the belton Road
initiative has a lot of government
backing and you know that's I feel like
I feel like this falls under that brick
breakdown the Belton Road initiative in
30 seconds or less for someone who isn't
it heard of it the Belton initiative or
the Silk Road economic built and the
21st century maritime Silk Road is a
development strategy proposed by the
Chinese government which focuses on
connectivity and cooperation between
Eurasian countries primarily the
People's Republic of China and
land-based Silk Road economic built and
ocean-going maritime Silk Road until
2016 the initiative was known as in
English as the one belt and one Road
initiative but the Chinese came to
consider the emphasis on the word one as
misleading its Chinese attempt to
reposition themselves to sort of the
focal points of all global trade ah
they're trying to be the global power of
trade
and they're doing it by making
themselves like just everything has to
pass through them well it doesn't seem
like the u.s. is interested in doing
that anymore but I feel like we're
venturing too far into the realm of
geopolitics oh no oops
perhaps politics maybe maybe we could
break this up with some pin my PC or
something yeah you should you should
switch to something more lighthearted
before we made a slag didn't put on some
watch list - a great idea shit
critic all right so let's let's talk
about some of your PC's because that's
the fun kind of love and stuff we talked
about on this show
starting with Matthew sorry slightly
late yes you were Matthew so late that
you were actually able to get on the
show Rison 5 2600 Ezra Wow Oh burps as
ruck x4 70 master sli motherboard asus
dual GTX 1066 gigabyte what Oh dual I
thought you meant dueling you can't do
that 16 gigabytes of tread and Zee 3200
cryo reg h7 mesh if I see with - arctic
140 millimeter fans in front planning to
get an LED strip to counteract dark tint
on glass yes the misha phi scene does
have a dark tinted side panel which i've
never been too fond of but let's take a
look at your system here very nice kind
of clean simple very simple humble setup
that's this your system what what cable
coming down here on the left side of the
keyboard that looks like a volume knob
that's probably connected to a sound
card maybe okay I could be wrong there's
the inside all right who knows um all
right so it looks pretty good color
coordination on point breath because it
looks like you've either got white or
blue LEDs in here obviously the LED
strip that you talked about that you
might put in later would do you some
favors in terms of illumination making
things kind of pop a little bit um think
about think about LED fans I mean you
have a very you have a very like
specific color that you're going with
like white or maybe there's some blue
there so you might not even need RGB
fans you could save money on just
getting some like you know blue or white
LED fans and I think that would look
really nice maybe on your
your rear fan now why is there just a
solo cup on the floor over here
that's very bizarre what that's the
weird place for a solo cup with no other
Solo cups I feel like I'll surround it
because I feel don't you feel like Solo
cups are like ants we're like you never
see one of them alone yeah usually
they're always way to move they're
grouped in like a pyramid structure for
for the playing of beer pong juvenile
festivities yeah yeah that's a very
bizarre I'll never figure out the the
solo cup and that and now the Solo cups
gone alright so the only thing really is
standing out to me here internally from
your PC your 6 pin PCI Express power
connector I'm guessing it's a 6 + 8 from
your power supply and then maybe even a
daisy chain then that's what this little
bundle is down there that's the only
thing that's standing out to me
depending on your power supply like I
don't I don't want to tell you to snip
off the daisy chain you could snip off
the daisy chain but you're good but only
do that if you've got another power
cable like a standby one that you could
loop up there right because you only
want to do that it like if you do
upgrade your graphics card in the future
you don't want to don't be stuck without
the the PCI Express it's it's I I don't
outright I wouldn't outright come until
you to snip that off just get an
extension
yeah maybe an extension maybe that would
be a simple solution that wouldn't be as
much of an investment I'd rather I'd
rather spend 8 bucks on an extension
than snip off a power supply cable that
I might need later yeah also worth
pointing out these fans on the back like
there it looks like full negative
pressure in there completely negative
pressures yeah I'm super negative so
you're gonna want to flip these front
fans to intake or suffer the dust
consequences that will allow you to take
advantage of the dust filtration
properties of the mesh fic with the mesh
that's in the front yes exactly ah
that's what you should do yeah you
should do all those things
thank you very much Matthew Matthew
moving on to Ryan or rien McClellan's r5
1600 X and MSI x3 70s li plus 16 gigs of
g.skill 3000 megahertz and our X 480
coolermaster liquid liquid light 120 and
NZXT phantom 240 blahdy blahdy blah
I wonder why are you Upton for the X 370
board
you only have one graphics card in there
seems a little of money there maybe need
some extra connectivity or you liked the
way it looked at any rate yeah at any
rate your cable management is all over
the place you have a much older case
much of all a case from another time
really so you don't really get that that
nice power supply shroud that we saw in
the last build so you might have to try
a little bit harder I would say with
with just tightening up your cables and
making sure that they're they're tied
together bunch up your excess cables all
in one spot and find a place for that
either in your hard drive cage that
actually works pretty pretty well for
for cases like this without a power
supply basement to put excess cables in
the hard drive cage or just by your RGB
fan there's an art there's a clear RGB
fan at the bottom of a very prominent
like RG and B LEDs that bottom fan there
which I aesthetically functionally it
might be giving you you know cut down a
couple degrees off your graphics card I
don't know but it can't it doesn't look
all that great and I feel like you would
you definitely need to tighten that your
cable management in order to even get
optimal airflow from that fan feel like
it's kind of just splitting up the the
air path coming off of those blades
additionally why is there just a random
like really old looking molex connector
floating here
we're great here is it it's like it's
like one of the clear ones you know is
that from the power supply that's why
I'm that's why I'm confused it power
supplies don't usually have just a
shorty little molex connector coming off
of in the deaths it's that small so I
don't know where the heck that's that's
even coming from it might be from the
end of this little looped around cable
here from the fan it might be even be
like an adapter because it looks like
there's another molex plug right here
right enhance enhance enhance okay all
right this is just a loose molex plug
chiller this is a loose SATA plug short
chillin this is another loose molex plug
that is white you expose not hard and I
just I don't know where that like is it
coming off with this this cable down
here looks like it's conflicting with
that bottom fan I mean I don't think it
actually is because it seems respective
yeah it's just it's just awkward so yeah
there's no reason that molex needs to be
there again tech cable management get
rid of that fan I don't know you're
gonna need a new power supply if you
really want to get nice looking cables
cuz extensions on this one do not make
any sense at all right yeah so there you
go hopefully these suggestions will help
you make it more aesthetically pleasing
PC in the future I think they will thank
you very much Ryan and Johnny Xiaomi an
AMD FX 6300 okay arctic freezer 7 pro
cooler gigabyte GA 7/8 LMT USB 3
motherboard 16 gigs of g.skill ripjaws X
ddr3 at 1600 and an msi gtx 1050 TI
gaming x 4g with a shitty iBUYPOWER case
according to him he said it was shitty
not me uh wow that is a pretty shitty
looking case it looks very very
ibuypower like super that's their jam
right there
ok so let's take a close hard look at
this system really not taking advantage
of your five and a quarter inch Bay
expansion possibilities here I would say
yeah yeah
okay Joe sooner but look at these five
and a quarter inch bass yeah I mean two
of them available hot swappable
interesting hard drive Trey's feel like
they've got like cheese look like cheese
cloth
cheese cheese boards he called us yeah
two and a half inch right those are for
SSDs I think yeah and then you've got
two hard drives in your actual cage the
color like your cable management is
actually really tidy I will say that is
this an extension yes wow that is an
extension all right there's an extension
for his graphics card and his eight pin
EPS as well graphics card as an
extension eight pin EPS as a alright so
the cable management's pretty good it's
it's interesting because I mean you for
what you're working with it's well done
right yeah it's very tidy for what it is
your cable extensions probably cost more
than the power supply though right
like what's this a VGA power supply it's
not it's a 600 BQ that's the battery
that's probably in $50 grand power
supply a set of extensions will cost you
I mean maybe I'm just I'm just saying
like if it were me you'd buy a better
power supply okay yeah kind of rather
have an eighty eighty or a hundred
dollar power supply especially that was
80 plus gold or something but he's got
pretty pretty light specs too at the
same yeah it's an interesting
combination of parts and you have you
have a situation where it's like an FX
6300 and at 10:50 TI gaming but there's
also some some what appears to be
investment in is some aesthetic stuff so
this is where I hesitate but who knows
maybe we don't know how he acquired all
of these things maybe they were acquired
in a way that didn't Versailles you know
maybe he traded them for sex yeah so if
you traded sex for your cable extension
the old Emily it's totally acceptable I
find it I find it completely appropriate
one of the most long assassins one of
the most honest transit
you could ever have as human being now
speaking of the shitty iBUYPOWER case
though look how much the USB 3.0 the
hateful USB 3.0 cable stands out like
from top to the middle to the actual
plug area like it's just there like hey
I suck as a cable and an extension
remember even how long you had to wait
for USB 3.0 that become a header on a
motherboard and then it was like a year
year and a half when we couldn't decide
on it like and then it finally came out
and it's it was stupid and bulky and
they made these hideous or blue ones
that look horrible
it's just a reminder of it standing out
all the more in a black and red case
yeah so let me say it again I don't know
what to say as far as what to do with
this like it doesn't look horrible
you know just looks it's the case the
case yeah can make the cabin of your
case can make your case look your system
look good or bad and I feel like if you
were just in a more modern case that
wasn't I my power it would look good but
because you're in the ibuypower case it
looks bad yeah and I feel like I
appreciate what you've done with what
you're working with here like for what
you've got it looks it looks okay yeah
no there's a few stray cables here and
there that could maybe be tidied up a
little bit but and compared to the last
bill that's it's golden so yeah like the
aesthetic upgrades would be a new case
and maybe a new power supply even the
power supply is fine because you got the
extensions on it but like I always
hesitate to advise someone to do that
when you're working with a an FX 6300
and a 1050 TI gaming I would keep the
1050 TI gaming maybe consider a core
platform upgrade before you spend too
much money on aesthetics that said if
you come across a new case that looks
better than upgrade to it yeah ok let's
move that Thanks thank you and next is
Eric and he's got a rise in 520 400g on
asrock a B
50 empro for 500 Samsung sad oh I think
he meant to write SSD and 2 terabyte
hard drive EVGA GTX 1066 gigabyte that's
superclocked
it's a sad that's in 16 gigs of 24 it
could be it could be very sad SST let's
find out that's a front panel coming off
I know I don't I don't understand that
is that to open up more airflow cuz it
looks like a fairly mesh front
oh no maybe it's all acrylic and maybe
that's why you're doing it because it's
getting hot I don't know yeah that would
be my guess music there's like a plastic
panel right here yeah
blocking the intake so he just popped it
open to allow it to get cooler that
makes sense we got that EVGA 600 BQ
power supply again here its back but hey
it's got all black cables so you know um
and no blue USB 3 cable that's good
alright now the shot with the flash here
looks the worst cuz it's a shot with a
flash but it does also give you an
actual look at the cabling inside yeah
so here again we could just like you you
just want to kind of unplug everything
and then remember where everything goes
and then redo your cabling like that's
really what this needs
you gotta you got a mess of stuff down
here at the bottom yaar you do have some
routing options that appears behind your
motherboard tray so just see what you
can do to take better advantage of those
suck as much stuff back there as
possible maybe consider rewire rerouting
some of these SATA cables for example
you know the same cables are bad um also
you have you have two 3.5 inch drives at
the bottom it looks like facing
different directions yeah so you could
flip them both so they're facing the
same direction and all the cables are
covering it coming out in the back side
and then your less visible you could use
the nice dusting in this case to your
yeah I didn't take fans look like they
haven't been cleaned in a while and it's
also kind of a pet peeve of mine where
like the fans are facing like the actual
logo on the center of the fans aren't
facing the right way the same way as
Corsair so you like rotate that bottom
fan 90 degrees clockwise septum
it's the corsair logo of the top fan I
would appreciate it but also potentially
I had that keep the label on the side of
the family
Lighting's fine Allred it's a black case
it's cool
mostly black interior everything seems
fine there if you're really running your
system with this front panel just like
tilted out like this I don't want to
tell you they're like if if you're that
dissatisfied with the airflow in the
case then maybe you can start looking at
new case options modifier even like I
don't know like can you pull this off
entirely or just like I actually cut a
couple holes in there or something like
that like that might be something to
consider
except the heavy panel cables are
connected to the panel having it propped
open they're just I mean it doesn't
doesn't look all that great yeah let's
call it apart literally but there you go
all right looks good thank you very
finely we have ice uh the be stuck with
Verizon v 1600 and a wraith spire cooler
as rock a be 350 pro for ATX motherboard
an EVGA super-super clocked GTX 1060
they had 16 gigs of rip jaws for grip
just 5 sorry and we have crucial MX 300
525 gig SSD with a corsair CX m 650 watt
80 plus bronze power supply and an NZXT
s340 chassis ok um ok so right off the
bat looks like a pretty clean system
let's look at pretty clean build cable
management looks pretty good to me
doesn't need a dusting yeah picture too
but I appreciate you giving us the raw
the raw look as is it does appear like
the system is on the floor and that's a
big no-no for me yeah me too if you got
it up off that carpet you might get less
dust in there overall you might have
your fan filters get clogged up less
quickly especially if you have pets or
anything yeah just just get it up off
the floor even make make a little make a
little platform for it that sets it up
you know 8 to 12 inches off the floor
and you'll be in a much better situation
than you were otherwise
might also give you some better
solutions for reading the external
cables that look like they kind of just
here and there outside the case I was
also gonna say looking at the second
picture with the lighting I like the
blue LED fan I think that's okay and
there I feel like you should get a
matching one for the rear exhaust yeah
that would kind of balance the lighting
on the case provides some more light for
your hair for the upper life I agree and
if you're gonna do that you might as
well get one for the top fan too because
they all three you could do both I mean
I think one in either position would be
fine if you're just looking for a small
investment to kind of balance things out
a little bit maybe something to add in
there when you do a little cleanup
project but yeah over than that like
very very clean looking you know like
he's good like your cable management's
yeah yeah you might consider a air
cooler upgrade for the for the rise in
stock cooler that might get you a little
bit more stable boosts clock speeds and
or maybe a little bit quieter
performance and you might even reduce
some of the dust buildup if you
installed an additional intake fan at
the front of your case because then you
have neutral pressure because right now
it's sort of it's sort of negative
pressure with the two exhausts and your
system is pretty dusty so maybe
something to consider
but that's all I got for Pitt that's all
we got prepared my PC guys thank you so
much for so many hours those and we can
move on to Q&amp;amp;A and John songs and stuff
so no I didn't find anything for it and
your yeah are we going to bed at 9:00
what I've been going to bed at 9:00 so
like trying to end the show a little bit
more on the early side say you're tired
I actually a.m. I went to bed at 4:00
you were telling me about that Cal drink
and Dr Pepper yesterday guys I told him
that story when you were peeing we're
all way ahead of you feel deceived just
led me right into that well there's a
lion I'm old oh yes a lion
Oh what the hell Oh cuz windows updates
Windows updates must have happened
always and there's all my passwords just
kidding it's Pam and face off that we
were gonna have and Spotify but wouldn't
it be fun we played we played a lot of
overwatch this past weekend did you yes
I'm jealous
any time you tell me like oh I putted
loaded few games recently like fuck you
Bob gonna howl like what you're not dude
there's two sides to it like on the one
hand we played a lot of video games on
the other hands like I can I can like
point out and count off on my fingers
the things that we didn't do because we
were playing video games but it was fun
and I wasn't probably wasn't more
important actually I actually now feel
like I am up to date on the various
overwatch characters the new characters
that have been released and their skills
and stuff like and I kind of know what
Moira does now hmm or like what there
are some breath type of thing yeah yeah
when there's a big bubble like floating
across stories but I think what is that
what is that what's he mystified that
yeah yeah I remember when you were doing
our livestream I was like I don't even
know this game
it was a little confusing and what I
realized was some of the some of the
heroes his ability as I was confused
about like came out like over a year ago
we are truly I need to play my video
game all right that's cool this is my
waist fall - good good good
all right so let's talk about some of
your donations in which you had to say
for $99.99 Jason Christophe 144 to 101
point four four to one point four six
all in 1,800 X at four gigahertz on Asus
then turned off then was at one point
three eight to one point three nine
sorry I'm also drinking oh that's fine
that makes a lot more sense than the
initial donation that you put on Paul's
half yeah we were wondering if you like
how could you do four point four volts
but not end well so the other thing you
need to you need to pay attention to
with Rison that I've noticed a lot is
it'll peak it'll do peak voltage that
it'll it'll jump itself up to very very
like sporadically but it doesn't stay at
that or so monitor your peak voltage but
also monitor what your average volt is
it voltages like while you're actually
doing a synthetic test or something like
that because the average voltage is what
I pay a little bit more attention to
than those peak numbers that said one
point three to one point three nine
sounds about where you should be so off
might be the way to go I suppose with
your with your setup you said must APU
right it's weird that EP you being on
would increase the voltage I don't know
how to explain that exactly but I don't
exactly know how epu works with the asus
motherboard so yeah we got it
JJ timeline for that one yes sometimes
the best thing to do is to turn off any
of the automatic stuff where it's like
trying to do this to save power or
trying to do this to like get you a
little bit higher frequency manual the
way I kind of know what you're doing
just like go with manual or go with the
ranges that are that are available or go
with the offset automatic settings noise
or so
again you don't know exactly how they're
behaving yeah Jordyn Sangster Williams
five Australia's for a portable VR
development system should I go with the
new Intel nook as it claims it can do VR
or a mini ITX 8700 k with a 1070 TI or
eleven series system while you're all
over the place here the Intel nook could
probably get you by if you're just
looking for the lowest cost solution out
of the options you've given and you're
okay with more of like an entry-level VR
experience maybe nothing super high-end
like high graphical fidelity but 8700 k
with a 1070 T I would definitely give
you a lot more performance than that
until milk ever could and even more so
if you were to pop an 11 Series card
into that configuration it really is
just gonna boil down to what
expectations you're looking for to get
out of your viewer experience if you're
just looking for like the simple stuff
like you're just trying to play like job
simulator and shit like that like you
know really easy like however junkers
type the stuff then then go with go with
the Intel nook and save like a thousand
bucks but if you really want to fork out
shell out the extra cash for that
premium level experience we're just
super buttery smooth even for high-end
VR games maybe ones that are being
developed by triple-a developers like
Bethesda and epic and stuff these days
then yes I would say build your own
system with some of the hardware that
you've configured there so yeah I would
mostly agree there I think I think the
nuke would be a good system to use to
demonstrate like how will your game that
you're developing perform on entry-level
hardware because I think like VR capable
is like an advertising feature like a
selling point that a lot of
manufacturers try to use like oh this
can do they are but really can do VR is
not exactly a there's no established
standard for like VR capable so like
well it can actually do it actually has
this much GPU processing horsepower or
ever at what free rate and you know yeah
the fact you say portable is the only
thing that would might make me lean
towards the Nook because it is very
small and easy to take with you and
everything but if you're doing
developments I think you'd want more
more I'd think you'd want a computer
that can read more yeah in general so
like a mini ITX portable 87 or kay 1075
system is probably better bit open up
more possibilities mb 67 13 dollars and
37 cents Kyle cheetahs fair warning I
might get to see you guys at Comic Con
meetup yes yeah I believe you're in the
nearest San Diego area if I remember
correctly MB so be cool cuz um yeah I
haven't seen you since twitch come last
year at the little meetup that we did
that'd be cool man hope to see you there
and ruch wires and then Canadians on the
previous week you guys mentioned that my
cables are messy would have to mod case
to hide fully the motherboard tray is
all I have to hide cables and the power
supply and full harddrive tray takes up
most of the space well I guess that yeah
you dude you can you know and I think
you get a certain point you know you
kind of have to let aesthetics go and
just do what makes the most sense for
the functionality of your system yeah if
you don't have enough space to hide your
cables that's fine yeah just try to try
to cinch him down try to you know get
them you know they don't have to look
good but try to get them out of the way
the airflow and that will give you a
functional system and you know it's it's
easy to ignore the critiques at Cal and
I give on pet my PC because it is
aesthetic and we're trying to get things
that would make things look better but
often functionality is more important
than that so absolutely you should never
feel bad for going for the functional
thing orphan just not having a case that
you have can make everything look
absolutely beautiful in yeah make and
make make sure that you're happy with
your specs first before you spend a dime
on cosmetics
I feel like performance should always
come first you know if you're not
exactly happy with the frame rate you're
getting or just how snappy your system
is then don't spend your next dollar on
custom cables or LED strips buy a faster
graphics card
you know and once our faster CPU once
that's where you want it to be then
Cosmetics can be like the last line of
action I guess for for upgrading your
system but but moving on thank you very
much and Roush wire for that explanation
pup Shepard $5 wags wags hope you're
well have you two thought about doing a
short film I thought I've done a few I
am sure you have pup none of which I am
jumping leaping out of my seat to see at
the moment just just knowing you being
you
good old pup yeah you know I've never
really thought about Disney short film
and you know what that's a lie I have
had to do short films all the time for
your channel mmm not really a short a
short film is like industry-standard
like 10 15 minutes like an actual short
film like a short films like 15 minutes
I would say look at us Sunday it's a
short film um I have considered like
doing something like that but it's just
it's so so much work you need the whole
team to do that sort of thing too but
and also like a lot of time to like
write a script that is good and yeah
it's a lot of work I kind of I kind of
enjoy the the really quick turnover of a
YouTube channel like I kind of enjoy
starting a project and finishing a
project within like a day or two and
then completely moving on to a
completely new project I think that that
quick sort of snappy snappy back and
forth turnaround works for me but I
think I have too much ADHD to actually
tackle on a short film that sounds as
cool as I'm sure it would be it was done
properly ah
all right thanks pop for reminding me
how inadequate I am Baja truck guy $5
what are your thoughts on the Corsair
c70 vengeance case despite it being five
ish years old
thanks love the show the Corsair c70
vengeance is one of the pieces never
built in the c70 vengeance neither a tie
neither by but I always liked that
yeah yeah I wish thought it'd look cool
at the ammo box yeah feels military
different colors for it it's a it was
one of like the most badass cases for
its time and even years after that it
was still one of the most like rugged
and just aggressive looking cases
without being like so cheesy and gamer
II the one thing I didn't like about it
was the the window because I had the fan
mounts I had the two I don't know if
they were 80 millimeter or 120 million
probably any other fan mounts on the
side that just kind of like just didn't
look all that cool look nice and you
couldn't see the inside of your system
very well because they had all the
ventilation holes and stuff yeah and I
was like the I feel like that was
probably the only reason why I'd never
bought one or looked into it because
just I didn't like that side panel but
I've heard it's a great case Steve loves
that case I will say this I have a
fractal define r5 that I have upgraded
multiple times over the past couple
years and basically from two three years
ago like what was a pretty decent
hundred ish dollar case then I added
tempered glass I added a USB 3.1 gen2
port and I I currently now feel that
that case has pretty much the entire
feature set that you would want for any
modern case yeah right now right exactly
this is a tempered glass it's became
very popular and then the connectivity
this is the main like functional thing
that's been upgraded right beyond that
it's like an ATX layout and you put your
power supply like maybe you don't have a
power supply shroud I guess that'd be
yes and maybe something else that you
might consider true but yeah those I
think those are the main things
functionally an aesthetic that's not
believe this has happened in the past
couple years so bright and I guess RGB
but like you wouldn't want that what to
see 70 cuz it's got it's kind of a
military color theme so yeah yeah
perfectly adequate case though see if
you can mod it and upgrade the i/o yep
maybe that'd be fun done deal just a boy
v Australia's no comment thank you for
your thank you so much donation I
appreciate it
DV ciao ciao for the fine out
is it that just owed us what I can't
even read this you suggest me is it just
me he forgot to meet me is it though
just a me or does it the urge to go a
poop or get a stronger the closer you
get to a toilet especially your home
coilette it's a peek when I find the
recent yeah I've had many experiences
where like I'm on my way home or almost
home and I'm driving and I'm like I'm
gonna shit like I got shit oh crap we're
gonna crap and I get it it's like your
body realizes the exact amount of time
you have between like to get there and
rush to where you go it's like where
you're just sitting down right is like
and you're like if this if I had gotten
here five seconds later like it would
have crap my pants and that's probably
not how it worked like if you were five
seconds later you would have known like
I'm five seconds later and I'm exactly a
little bit longer but that's always what
it feels like right so yeah I I know
what you mean I've always thought like
if if if I was at a and I had to get to
B to take a shit like I could make it
right or I'm sorry like if I if there
was an a and there was a C I could get
to see and make it but if along the way
I found a B that also had a toriel that
I could take a shit at I would like be
so ready to shit but if for whatever
reason be like I found out the last
minute that the toilet wasn't working or
I couldn't shit there whatever I would
never be able to make it to C because I
would have my body would have already
like loosened my bowels in preparation
of the defecation that rhymes must be
true at location B to the point where
there's no turning back you're past the
point of no return and there's no more
muscles to to sort of contract that that
that shitstorm that's about to happen so
what I'm saying is I agree with you
we've all been there done that it's such
a such a satisfying feeling though when
you finally do get there Oh every time
it's awesome dropping loads losing
pounds space elephant five dollars I've
been watching you guys for only like
four to five months now that's longer
than most people do I'm sure I have
binge watched y'all and I gotta say you
two single-handedly got me into
computers
Jim computers Jeff that's that's a whole
new thing that we don't even know about
so imagine what we could get you into
all the topics that we do know about
well that's cool I'm glad that you we
inspired you in some way curious kinda
what you binge watch too though like did
you been to watch our normal stuff or
did you binge watch the live shows
maybe but anyone who binge watches the
live shows I feel like there must be one
or two people out there have done it
yeah I'm curious like what effect it has
had on you long term that's partial
since marshal insanity mental like if we
could somehow to do a scientific test
and like to measure IQ levels or like
intelligence or like problem-solving
skills like would it go up or down I
don't know I'm not sure it's like some
homeless guy I used to run I lost every
one of your shows oh my god is that
that's Stephen Hawking you are you are
just just let your let your bad person
why that person with your horrible thing
all right Blake Scott $14.99 once again
no comment then we have no comment you
plan to say thanks $14.99 let's have not
99 in this with this donation yeah you
know that's the technique that people
selling stuff make to seem like it cost
less so yes if you're donating then you
maybe spend the extra penny and it makes
ya seem like you've donated more right
like I don't it's not a big deal to me
I'm just saying I'm kind of pissed let's
take up the psychology of me like $14.99
or $19.99 and it's also like more keys
that you have to enter yeah it's more
work you could have just write one for
so so Johnny woolen with the 19.99 $7.99
says love you guys quick question while
running an opt-in 900p SSD through the
PCH or a plx chip result at any
significant latency I wouldn't say
significant so maybe a little it's gonna
depends I believe in both of those
situations on what else you have going
through that interface plx is basically
a glorified switch for PCI Express Lanes
so in a situation where you don't have
any compete any any devices competing
for that bandwidth it adds like just a
tiny tiny tiny bit of latency and it's
really negligible for the most part PCH
is kind of the same kind of the same way
although I don't believe there's a whole
lot of latency involved there since it
is PCHS
native chipset connectivity but the PCH
is also kind of like a glorified switch
depending on what platform you're on I
can believe that main stream is for
actual pcie 3.0 lanes flexed out into
like 20 actual connectivity lanes so
there again it's gonna depend do you
have devices connected to all those
different things are all of those
devices trying to use that bandwidth at
the exact same time then yes it will
affect your throughput if if not then
it's probably just gonna be a very minor
hit on latency right and it gets the
whole lane and probably and probably
mostly negligible yeah if you're doing a
bunch of octane 900p drives and you want
to connect them all and do some raid
configuration and have maximum
performance I recommend going directly
PCI Express connectivity and there's
lots of different rise or cards again
depending on the platform that you're on
Asus and quite a few other companies
make them that allow you to connect
those tricked me to be a PCI Express and
that would be your best bet
Jason Kristoff $9.99 hey if I send you
guys both a six-pack of the beer from my
local brewery yes we'll drink it I drink
during on some hardware how long do I
have to wait for you guys to get because
I'll be pissed if it gets skunky
so Jason
we usually go and check our peel boxes I
won't I want to say once a month once a
month maybe every three weeks yeah at
the most but if you send us beer like
tweet to us that you sent us beer like
every day for the next few days you'll
probably be a higher likelihood that we
go and check it to make sure we get that
and then just make sure you're sending
us beer that's not as likely to get some
good skunky I mean you know beers not
getting naturally gonna get skunky true
don't buy cold beer and send it to us
cuz it'll like temperature changes are
bad don't buy beer don't send us beer
and green glasses darker glasses is
better yeah light can cause beer to get
skunky overtime true those will be my
suggestions or you know send us send us
a a BevMo gift card or something if we
can go get our own beer make sure and
tell us what to get yeah and we'll buy
whatever you bad works do Dewayne bond
$5 when I turn off or restart my new
computer my keyboard will not work
oh I have to do a hard restart and then
it'll work that's wrong I've had this
problem what kind of keyboard is it
actually when I've had this problem
before I think it has more to do with
the motherboard the ports I'm plugged
into in the motherboard I would try I
try plugging into different USB I've
never had that have tried to plug into
different USB ports on the motherboard
just I'll work upon reboot there is
sometimes there are there are keyboards
themselves that have different like I
can't listed on top of my head but like
of course through some corsair keyboards
for example they have the bios which
have a bios which this one actually does
right this has a bios which with four
different modes on the top so holding
rain swishes they're pulling sometimes
it's pulling rates other things that
like a BIOS might be looking forward
that the keyboard might be trying to
connect in a mode that it doesn't like
so
switching up your keyboard but something
like this might allow you to switch
between those different modes and find
some find one that doesn't cause the
keyboard to become disconnected but I've
also had just motherboards that were
just really finicky with like restarts
and stuff like that and like it could
also be a power delivery issue I know
for example really weird issue with my
keyboard and mouse on my main system
because I have a sit stand desk and and
there was a while where when I would
make this desk go from sit to stand mode
and it would suddenly draw more power
and like my mouse I could see it the
light would go off on my mouse and then
my mouse would still it was all
connected the same power something yeah
everything's on the same power strip but
it's like the computer itself was
getting a little a little bit less
current right for a brief moment as the
as the sits and desk goes on have you
ever plugged in and I would have to
unplug the mouse and plug it back in and
already get to work again have you ever
much of a kilowatt into one of those up
desks to see how much power it's
actually drawing as you know change the
to be interesting it's a good question
but if it's like pulling like 100 watts
or some shit yeah I mean you would think
it would have to because you could those
can sustain a lot of weight and still be
able to like hydraulic lift it like no
problem so yeah I wonder like if that's
gonna affect your CPU yeah do I think my
the thing I would do that's the simplest
and doesn't involve spending any more
money would be just be trying different
USB ports to connect your you know to on
your computer even even consider if you
get that far and you try the ones on
your i/o and you're not having any luck
consider getting a little USB 2.0 like
bracket for internally and plug into one
of your USB 2.0 is on the board and plug
your keyboard into that see if that
could help in certain situations
situations depending on the board I've
also seen like downloading the actual
software that belongs to that saw that
motherboard I'm sorry that keyboard
manufacturer can also help I know like
Logitech keyboards some some Logitech
keyboards like the one that I bought
recently was the G Pro it didn't even
work at all until I install the Logitech
Gaming software
to it so I would imagine there are some
other me keyboards out there that just
don't function 100% properly until
you've downloaded either maybe updated
the firmware on them that's something to
check as well or just maybe like the
whatever software that they're
associated with that always something to
bear in mind though it seemed really
weird to me though it's really really
weird when you're good alright pup
Shepherd pup just hit nine hundred subs
no you're almost at a grand mr. pup we
wish you good luck to the next 100 subs
and get you to that quad digit BAM
great thousands yeah sure old gerald
$10 spent the fourth building my new rig
submitted pit picks for pit my PC thanks
again for all your expertise and
inspiration
cheers fellas hey congrats on the new
rig man that's awesome
Congrats umm what a what a day to build
it on great way to spend the fourth
freedom freedom building hope it has a
red white and blue theme you have the
right to build a PC I wish you like cool
cell processing so why are you why are
you donating you should we should be
giving you money you're a moderator Kyle
I think donations are great even more so
for friends it's like saying you mean
this much to me in this many dollar
amounts it is you know when you think
about it that way
donations are kind of a nice way to
quantify your appreciation of someone or
something so I guess I'm only worth $5
to you that's kinda affecting depressing
so I was hoping that there was a little
bit more between us but I was gonna
point out that sign so I'm not pissed
cell can put whatever he wants into the
show dock so he could have put saw
processing with the hundred dollar
donation and total control and I guess
that's all yeah I guess it just this is
all to say that you're trustworthy
asshole so next time you do this you
should really inflate the dollar amount
that you've
I want to see a $50,000 cell processing
donation I'm looking forward to that
but do you like puts it in some
occurrences that's what you mean that's
what you mean to us Paola remember
remember Sal also with great power comes
great responsibility
yes and you you have the power of
editing the show Docs but also that
fifty thousand dollar donation would be
like a gift it's like a one-time gift to
us which means it would be tax
it would be taxable it would really be
for you it's like it you can because you
can I learned this from Shawshank
Redemption you can give your wife like a
one-time lump-sum lump sum gift yeah and
what does that do what what is it what
does that do
and it's tax-deductible no it's it's not
I mean it's not taxable oh it's done
yeah oh yeah so you're saying that we
should get married to sell I'm saying
I'm saying you should watch shank
redemption it's a really good movie it
is still number one on IMDB ever leave
like greatest movies of all time char
shanks been up there for like like 10
years going strong so get busy living
get busy dying god damn right damn right
fucking hell what's the guy's name
hmm Andy Dufresne Andy Dufresne Andy
Dufresne
I read read this Morgan Freeman who's
read yep oh so good I know what I'm
watching when I get home
don't be up till 4:00 again alright
Jason Jason Christophe again $9.99 $9.99
not $1,000 the reason for my $0.99 is
that for whatever reason YouTube on the
phone doesn't do whole dollar amounts
and it does do and it and does a mount
and 99 so I guess it can only do 99
cents on YouTube mobile interesting
that's really bizarre
I guess Kevin Mountain is also on mobile
because he just donated $14.99 110 and
then what's with the 90 I guess we know
now hey that's any just roasts love you
love you boo well thank you Kevin love
you too mr. Mountain thank you very much
affirmation and thank you very much
again Jason for the donation gerald $5
Kyle never gets my name right
I said Gerald I said Gerald the first
time but I mispronounce everyone's name
the first time III mispronounce
everyone's name intentionally the first
time around because I said they say I
don't know maybe it's just yours yeah
you're probably right
occasionally I'll just mispronounce like
I always go back to that key and peele
sketch where I think it's key is a
substitute teacher and he's like super
ghetto or something and he's like
reading he's doing it he's taking
attendance he's taking roll and like
he's super ghetto though so it's like
Aaron or whatever he's like hey Ron I'm
looking for a any Ron look I don't know
you have to watch that sketch it's
hilarious but I always think people
think back to that and so like when I'm
reading names I'm like Jarabe anyway
it's that's where it comes true that's
just my head and you're welcome that
explains it so Kyle never gets my name
right so here is money for butchering my
name hey I'll butcher everyone's names
from now on if it gets you more money
think President Gerald Ford yes or
Arnold's best friend from Hey Arnold
those are those are very good references
although I never grew up with
Nickelodeon so that one is lost on me I
never watched here
yeah I I didn't have cable growing up I
had just basic television with an
antenna you know and Heather like wifey
sauce always gives me shit for it
she's like no wonder you're so messed up
I'm like what what just cuz I didn't
have cable she's like it explains a lot
I'm like what how she's like yeah he
just didn't he never watched Rugrats or
like real monsters like no like Doug I'm
like mm-hmm she's like I never watched
any of those takes very seriously well
you're also a little bit older than me
sad panda sad panda Paul I don't mean to
make you feel outdated and irrelevant
Paul but let's cut damn what's the
afternoon was that on it was the diss
each channel right yeah that was main
you know I was keep you didn't have to

cable money for that that was Disney
Channel was on I think it was on Fox or
something like that
