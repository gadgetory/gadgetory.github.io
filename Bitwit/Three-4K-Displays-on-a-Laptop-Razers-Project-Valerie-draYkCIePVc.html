to you by fractal design MSI and cable
modern check out the links in the
description below because if you don't I
will find you
and I will kill you we're at the razor
booth now it's looking pretty sharp get
it so we've been taken to the secret VIP
backroom at the razor booth here so
they're gonna be showing off this bad
boy look at that triple panel display
and the frickin GT X 1080 laptop are you
kidding me giving do you think if I kill
everyone in this room and grab the
laptop I can make a dash for the exit I
can take him I can definitely take him
definitely take care Paul on the other
hand yeah I can totally tell you though
smash his head in with his own camera
yeah you like that alright guys so this
is project Valerie this is what they're
calling it again we're at the razor
booth and as you can see it's a laptop
with triple 4k displays which is just
absolute beastly now a lot of people who
are walking by I was hearing people
saying like oh my god that's so stupid
which if you don't have any use for this
of course it is you would never pay an
arm and a leg for something this crazy
however if you're a hardcore gamer on
the go or if you just have a really
tight space or if you happen to be like
a workstation professional like myself
and you're at an event like CES and
you're editing footage constantly this
is a freaking godsend and we've honestly
me personally I've never seen anything
like this before
so it's pretty exciting there's a ton of
people that are just surrounding this
thing because everyone's just in awe
shock and awe as myself but basically
what we're dealing with here is a triple
panel display that these two peripheral
panels actually slide seamlessly in
front or baby behind that front panel so
they don't actually fold out they they
kind of slide but they're motorized and
they'll actually fold out automatically
I think you like press a button or
something and it'll just pop out and
like you can see the bezel is really
clean you don't have to like do any
manual adjusting it's all automatic
which is really nice and the specs on
this thing right now this is based off
of the razor blade Pro I believe so
we're talking to core i7 either six or
seven gen processor from Intel and we've
also got a GTX 1080 in there currently
now the issue that I'm seeing here or
with that is that a 1080 probably can't
push triple 4k in a lot of Triple A
games so they're gonna have to think of
a way to solve that either by lowering
the resolution on the monitors which I
don't see happening or maybe adding in
some SLI action maybe having two gtx
1080s in here or perhaps if Nvidia
ever mans up and announces the gtx 980ti
maybe we could see that in this thing as
well also kind of depends on when this
thing comes out if this if this product
doesn't hit the market until next year
and there's a whole new generation of
CPUs and GPUs then that's of course
going to be what this is going to be
Spectacor concerned we do get some RGB
lighting underneath both of the side
monitors which is pretty fancy of course
RGB is still taken off and exploding
everywhere well you wouldn't expect much
less from Razer anyway we've also got
just kind of a really nice sleek
aesthetic all around that it is very
reminiscent of the Razer Blade Pro and
actually when this thing is all folded
up and closed you're actually only
talking 10 to 12 pounds maybe which is
still pretty heavy in fact however there
are other laptops that are 17 inches
just like this one that aren't even
heavier than that so the fact that
they're able to fit triple displays in
that type of form factor at that weight
is pretty damn impressive they didn't
mention battery life but I would imagine
it's anywhere from three to five minutes
all right guys really quick drop-in shot
something I forgot to mention if you
look at the back of the laptop here you
can see that there's a panel on each
side that kind of opens up for
ventilation these panels actually open
up automatically as soon as you press
the button to pop out those side panels
beside monitors there and obviously it's
just for aesthetic design and just for
looks to look pretty badass quite
frankly because let's be honest monitors
don't really need any additional cooling
but just thought that was something
pretty cool that you're - to show you
guys they don't have a demo of that
actually happening this is just a
cosmetic version again they're still
working on a fully functional prototype
that hopefully we'll be able to see soon
another interesting thing that razer was
mentioning is they might release a model
similar to this that only has one panel
that that pops out out of the side
instead of three and i think that's the
one that I would go for if it ever came
to fruition simply because I don't
really care too much about triple
display gaming actually prefer a single
monitor but when I'm streaming for
example and I'm playing a game that way
it's nice to have a companion monitor
for all your discord stuff your voice
Twitter etc a twitch also when you're
editing double dual man dual monitor
display is just pretty much exactly
where it's at for me so leave your
guys's thoughts in the comment section
below and let me know what you think of
this thing if it's totally over the top
or if you would totally buy one in a
heartbeat and also let me know what kind
of MSRP you might expect for it from a
a product like this I mean I guess it
depends on what the internal specs
eventually turned out to be but I'm sure
you guys already have some ideas
floating around that you want to share
in the comments that's going to do it
for now guys thank you so much for
watching be sure to tune in for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon
from CES 2017 and a huge shout out to my
sponsors MSI fractal design and cable
mod take out their stuff in the
description below and I'll see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
