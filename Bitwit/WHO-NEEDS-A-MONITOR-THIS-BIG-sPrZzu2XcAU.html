description for more info what's
cracking people welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well today
I'm taking a look at this massive
display from the folks over at LG this
is model number 4 3u d7 9b and it's
freakin huge it's giant it's a 4k IPS
display at 43 inches actually 42.5
diagonally to be exact and some of you
might be asking the question already why
would you even need a monitor of this
size why not just buy a TV for example
well I think personally that there are
some situations where you would want a
TV sized display with monitor like
capabilities and this sort of offers the
full package for someone with those
needs and we're gonna be talking about
all of that later today on their product
page LG lists a couple applications such
as connecting multiple devices to this
monitor and being able to view them
side-by-side with picture and picture or
picture by picture functionality that
can be useful for things like coding on
one system and watching your live
preview of that code on another or
perhaps if you're a stock trader or
you're a day trader I know nothing about
the stock market and trading stocks but
apparently there's a need for having
multiple systems or multiple live
monitoring screens at once now no matter
how physically large the screen gets
they're still gonna be limited to the
resolution of the panel itself which in
this case is 3840 by 2160 however having
a physically larger screen could help
you see things especially when zooming
in let's say you're in Photoshop or
you're in a 3d modeling software where
you're really zeroing in on tiny little
vertices just having physically a larger
screen might be able to help you see
those a little bits of detail more
easily so there's a number of
applications that that I can think of
off the top of my head right now I'm
sure you guys have your own that you can
add to that list if you have any other
ideas on what you would use a 43 inch
monitor for leave them in the comments
below I'm curious to see what you guys
come up with
so with this panel you are getting
native 4k at up to 60 Hertz and what
more about that in just a bit you also
get a 5 millisecond grade a gray
response time so potentially this might
be a great panel for gaming we'll
investigate that later on but
additionally let's talk about the
hardware a bit because we've got the
monitor out here to look at nice and
pretty it does feature 210 watt speakers
and they actually sound pretty good for
for being a monitor that is now of
course this is a large mater so LG was
able to fit better speakers and more
hardware in here
and they sound great actually the basis
is pretty rich and clean again from what
you would expect from a monitor you're
more so looking at you know like TV
sound as opposed to monitor sound
there's no distortion even at max volume
like no distortion whatsoever and the
sound seems fairly well balanced it's
not gonna weigh you it's not gonna blow
you away but it certainly could replace
the need for some middle-of-the-road
desktop speakers for example this is
fitted with a matte screen so anti glare
is really nice especially if you're
working in bright daytime environments
and things like that
additionally you've got some pretty thin
bezels I've seen thinner for sure but
the fact that this monitor is so huge
makes the the bezels look a bit thinner
than they actually are and overall it's
a very sort of minimalistic simple
looking design there's no aggressive
features here even the LG branding at
the bottom in the middle is very subtle
and discreet there's a nice little
joystick right underneath the LG logo
that actually lets you navigate the
on-screen display the OSD is very
organized very well laid out and the
joystick works very well however it does
not compete with the included remote
control this thing is awesome
I don't know too many monitors that
actually come with the remote of course
with the size this is I guess it's sort
of warrants one since you'll probably be
sending a bit further away from it than
the typical monitor but some really nice
adjustments here you get volume control
brightness adjustment there's a you know
on-the-fly picture by picture picture
and picture
functionality full screen you can change
the picture mode there's an audio select
so even if you have multiple systems
connected to this display you can change
just the audio input which is really
nice there's game mode which we'll talk
about more later and pretty much
everything that you can do with the
joystick you can do 10 times easier with
this remote which is super handy take a
look at the back of the panel here we
can see the stand which was really easy
to install only took me about a minute
or two to get it up and running it's a
very sturdy stand there's like
minimal wobble it's it's it's very
sturdy indeed it kind of needs to be for
a panel this size I think overall this
display is about 35 pounds so it's good
that the that LG did not skimp on the
stand however I would have liked to see
more than just tilt functionality the
tilt is just fine but I need my I need
my swivel I like my swivel and I like my
height adjustment there's of course no
panning either but perhaps I've just
been spoiled but by all of the AC stands
I've been using lately I would think
just for a panel this this size
especially for the price tag that give
you a little bit more flexibility and
then just tilt but some people aren't
going to mind it of course if you really
if it does bother you there is a base
amount 200 by 200 base amount at the
back here you can wall mount this guy
and pretty much use any mount you want
now behind here tucked away at the
bottom you'll find all of your i/o
including an AC power plug for powering
the device and an rs-232 C port which I
have never seen on a display nor have I
ever used I did some quick googling and
apparently it's for you know it's an
older interface for connecting you know
modems and Printers to your PC I'm not
exactly sure what the application is
here primarily I'm sure you guys will
let me know in the comments though
additionally we've got four HDMI ports
now two of these are HDMI 2.0 B and can
output 4k at 60 Hertz but the other two
are not so you can only go up to 30
Hertz 4k with those there's also a
single DisplayPort 1.2 which can do 4k
at 60 Hertz however you need to enable
DisplayPort 1.2 functionality within the
OSD so if 60 Hertz isn't working for you
for whatever reason with that plug
that's why you need to enable it using
the on-screen display also something to
note here is that all five of these
ports support HDCP to point to so that
gives you full compatibility whether
you're streaming 4k content from various
streaming services like Amazon or
Netflix or if you're watching some Ultra
HD
blu-rays for example anything that's
copyright protected within those
standards is gonna be fully supported on
this display which is nice to see now
one caveat of this display is that LG
actually prompts you to use their
specific video cables with this panel
and if you use anything else then bad
things can happen I you I tried using my
display
poor cable with this perfectly
functional a freshly built system and
the video signal was cutting in and out
it was actually the screen was going
black and turning back on there was
artifacting and stuff until I switch to
the included DisplayPort cable and then
everything is working just fine but
that's kind of weird you have five video
inputs you would think LG would give you
five video cables with this panel but
instead you only get one DisplayPort and
one HDMI cable so that's kind of weird
what happens if either of those go bad
or you want to connect more than two
devices to this panel do you have to go
to LG directly to buy more of their
cables separately I'm not exactly sure
how that's going to work I think that's
sort of a strange and kind of not the
best move on their part but I digress
additionally we've got a single USB 3.1
type C port this is great if you want to
do some data transfer or some charging
for your mobile device or even sending a
4k video signal to this guy with all
with with just a single cable it's
actually really nice especially if
you've got like a laptop or something
like that that has a USB type-c port you
can easily do so next to your type C
port you get a pair of USB 3.0 type-a
ports one of which supports 1.5 amp
quick charge and the other does not it's
it's a slow charge but can charge
nonetheless finally you've got a
headphone audio jack 3.5 millimeter
auxilary and that is what's going to be
switchable so if you have some speakers
or some headphones connected to that you
can use the remote within the OSD to
switch your various audio inputs should
you have multiple systems or devices
connected to this display on that note
let's flip this panel around one more
time and talk about what it's like to
actually use it so from the information
I was able to dig up online this seems
to be an 8-bit color panel with a 72%
NTSC color gamut which is of course far
from the best that's out there so while
it's plenty good for casual media
streaming on Netflix or Amazon or even
gaming it looks really good with gaming
I would not necessarily recommend it for
a professional level content creation
when it comes to color correction for
example or photo editing now it's worth
noting that the very edges the the left
and right edges of the screen kind of
have this darkened shadow running from
the very top to the very bottom of them
top and bottom not so much but
definitely on the left and right so for
example I'm sitting on the very right
side of my monitor
right now if I move my cursor way to the
left all the way to the edge I can
barely see my cursor now it sort of
disappears under this slight shadow I
can only see maybe 20% of that cursor
however if I move my head so that I'm
looking straight at it the cursor
becomes fully visible and I can see no
problem so this is just this is not a
defect I looked it up this is just a
common trait of certain IPS displays and
this happens to be one of them so it's
not an issue for me personally I haven't
run into any situation so far with this
monitor where I'm like I can't read the
text that's way off in the corner there
or way off to the edge most of the time
you're gonna have some padding around
the important stuff if it's a
well-designed webpage and things like
that but for some of you it may be a
larger issue so it is worth mentioning
quick note on backlight bleed this panel
does a great job of not having any
tested this with you know just a black
screen in the dark and really there's
just very subtle very slight backlight
bleed in the top corners of the screen
but nowhere else it's it's some of the
best backlight bleed that I've seen on
an IPS display so that's definitely good
news so now I'm gonna quickly give you
guys a demo of the picture and picture
and picture by picture functionality
it's actually pretty cool a lot of you
guys are already familiar with this and
how it works I'm gonna be using the
remotes to do all the navigating within
the OSD because it's super easy I
currently have two systems that are
hooked up to the monitor and
unfortunately I don't have four but you
guys will get the idea you can do
four-way split screen again if you if
you click the picture by picture and
picture-in-picture button on the remote
it'll ask you if you want to apply the
previous setting that was used I'm gonna
say no because I want to show you guys
the full list of options that we have
here so there's of course full screen
you've got to a split screen there's two
ways you can do that you can do left and
right or you can do top and bottom again
assuming you only have two inputs and
then you can do four-way split screen
where you have one screen in every
quadrant if you do four-way split screen
you're getting four
1080p images that are pretty much
equivalent to a 21.5 inch screen so it's
kind of like having quad 21 inch
monitors at full 1080p on each one so
that's kind of cool
and then they've got picture-in-picture
for those of you who are unfamiliar
picture-in-picture basically puts one
system or one input completely
fullscreen and then the site
system in a smaller window in one of the
four corners and you can actually put
you can designate which corner you want
this smaller screen to appear and we've
got in the bottom rights fourth quadrant
right now but you can put it in
literally any screen on the display so
that's pretty cool as well finally let's
talk about gaming I've got csgo fired up
right now and I'm gonna be jumping in in
just a moment so all the comments will
now be filled with how terrible I am at
this game I'm really bad I'm really
really bad so you've been warned but
gaming on this display is actually
pretty good and pretty not good in
certain ways so first off we'll talk
about the good first off color is is
good for gaming
all right response time is excellent 5
milliseconds response time there's a
game mode you can access either through
the OSD with a joystick or your
controller which allows you to actually
change the response time value
unfortunately it doesn't tell you what
those values are so I don't know if the
fastest setting is 5 milliseconds or if
the middle setting is 5 milliseconds and
you can go even faster than that I'm not
sure it's nowhere in the manual I
couldn't find anything online maybe I'm
just not looking hard enough but at
least you get at least 5 milliseconds
response time which is plenty fast for
most people I hate this gun because I'm
so slow and yeah it's super responsive
it's very quick this is better than any
TV that you could ever play on at least
for now it's faster than the the LG nano
cell TV I recently reviewed and that was
already fast enough for my needs I feel
like even some competitive gamers will
be happy with the performance of this
monitor for an IPS it really is quite
quick additionally you get again 4k 60
Hertz which is gonna be okay for some
and super pleb and an obnoxious for
others you know 100 Hertz plus
masterrace and all that sort of thing 60
Hertz at 4k is fine for me but you know
of course with 4k 144 Hertz displays
around the corner you might want to hold
out for that if if that's your thing
unfortunately 60 Hertz is the absolute
cap for this display so there's no you
know cranking it down to 1080p so you
can get faster refresh rate out of it by
any means that would have been pretty
sweet but unfortunately you can't do
that now some of the negatives or just
other things to consider first off is
the physical size of this monitor is in
my opinion going to be too big to put on
your your desk any kind of
Desktop Desk you know for for PCs and
stuff like that
is gonna be too small for this massive
screen so you're either gonna have to
wall mount it so it's a bit further away
from you or you're gonna have to sit
further away from your desk to really
enjoy it which means you know good luck
finding out how you're gonna use the
keyboard and mouse on your lap unless
you get like of course their lap dog or
something like that so screen size might
be an issue in a more conventional
desktop setting maybe you got to put it
in the living room to really get the
most out of it additionally screen
tearing is a huge issue now for me
screen tearing is something that I never
used to notice until I started testing
more and more games and started hearing
more about it and now I can't ignore it
now it's just everywhere cannot unsee so
to speak so if that's you then you're
gonna be bothered by the fact that this
has no adaptive refresh rate technology
built in and at the end of the day if
you are say an AMD GPU user it might be
kind of hard to justify buying this
display when there are a lot of other 4k
panels at this at around this size that
do support free sync and you know the
the implementation of that free sync is
questionable among some some of those
Korean based panels however it is there
and should offer a smoother experience
with an AMD GPU than this panel
currently does so to sum things up here
overall I like this monitor I think it's
one of those products that is either
gonna be completely useless to those who
don't eat it
obviously or is gonna be a godsend to
those who do it's a very niche product
which kind of makes it very polarizing
at the same time there are certain
things that work beautifully on this
monitor and other things that I really
wish would be changed for a future
revision but overall guys let me know
what your opinions are on this display
if you would ever have a need for a
monitor this size very curious to hear
