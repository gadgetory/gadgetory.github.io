another video with me behind the camera
so my apologies you know get to see my
beautiful face today but we are to be
doing an interesting test or at least I
think it is comparing two different AO
configurations because the H ATI b2 from
Corsair and as well as there are there
h-60 now these are both rockin identical
pumps I checked with the manufacturer
themselves running at the same
operational speed of around 4,300 RPM on
the pump of course they're rockin the
same fans those kind of SP looking fans
alright the same fans come out of the
box the tubing thickness seems pretty
identical and really the main
differences between these two units are
the radiator thickness with the H ATI
being quite a bit fattier and also the
the fan number the number of fans
included the H Adi comes with two fans
you can do a push-pull with that guy
but the h-60 only comes with one fan
then why do I have two fans on the h6
day well I'm glad you asked actually
we're going to be doing something a
little bit different instead of running
these these coolers just stock how they
come out of the box I thought it'd be
interesting to do a little experiment to
see if radiator thickness is better than
having multiple fans interesting right
especially with okay so here's here's my
here's my theory actually I measured
this this this setup right here with the
H ad with one fan it is actually only
two millimeters thicker then the h-60 in
push-pull they're about the same
thickness so especially how small
form-factor builds have become just
ridiculously popular in recent years and
especially with small form-factor
Cassie's giving more support for liquid
cooled a iOS particularly the 120
millimeter variants seem to be very
popular in these types of cases so these
might be two potential options that use
small that you mini ITX builders I
didn't call you small builders I didn't
mean that
might be interested in so which one
which one do you go for if you only had
about 75 millimeters of clearance in
your small form-factor case do you go
with a thicker radiator Rock and one fan
or do you go with a thinner radiator
with two I don't know I also thought
this video was good timing since we are
going to be seeing some a m4 mini ITX
boards for Rison come in soon you could
say there on the horizon has that Joe
got an old yet I'm sure
but another thing to consider here is
that at the time of filming the h ati is
20 bucks more expensive than the h-60
alright its 85 bucks versus 65 bucks but
if you're going to run either of these
setups I mean this already comes with 2
fans yeah I mean you're only going to
use one so you kind of have one fan that
you just you got a spare you know
whatever do with it as you will
but with age 60 to run push Bowl you
need to get a second fan which would
cost you about 15 to 20 bucks if you're
getting something identical or very
similar to the included Corsair fan so
that pretty much puts both of these
solutions at around the same price point
of 80 to 85 bucks they're about the same
thickness but which one cools the best
that's really what we want to know and
of course you have to consider that
noise emissions from having two fans are
going to output they're going to be a
little bit higher than having one fan
speaking of which all the fans in
today's testing will be running at 100%
fan speed but before we take a look at
the actual temperatures and quickly go
over the testing hardware here so we've
got an Intel Core i5 7600 K that I've
overclocked a four point eight gigahertz
at one point three volts on the vcore
running stable it's a 264 running in the
background for about half an hour now so
I would I would call that stable enough
for this test we've got 16 gigs of
g.skill tried NZ ddr4 3200 on an MSI Z
270 gaming Pro carbon motherboard over
here okay Corsair ax 1200 eye power
supply get that out of the way I've got
a gtx 1070 I'm sorry 1080 Ti that's
necessary for this test founders Edition
running its stock speeds and a one
terabyte Rd 400 Toshiba OCZ alright SSD
and dot 2 whatever alright let's put a
load on this sucker and see what she's
made of alright y'all so as I continue
my rambling please pay attention to the
current package temps of both of our
setups here a quick disclaimer I
initially wanted to drop some real-time
commentary as I was running these tests
but as it turns out having our corsair
fan spinning at 100% fan speed picks up
on my microphone way too much so here I
am stuck doing this half-assed voiceover
but what else is new at least we can
still take a look at the data together
by the power of post-production the
readouts that you're seeing right here
are a real-time response to what's
happening in the background which is the
opening scene of GTA 5 with maxed out
settings at 2560 by 1440 I so apologize
if you here
in the background my shitty neighbor as
always another disclaimer is that I was
wrong about the Corsair fans at the
beginning being identical they're not
turns out the fan included with the h-60
runs at a slightly lower rpm so I've
removed it entirely from today's testing
and I'm sticking with only the H ATI
fans for everything so on with the data
though with an ambient of 24 degrees
Celsius both configurations seem to be
performing similarly but to me the H ATI
seems to be doing a slightly better job
by around two to five degrees on average
it's kind of hard to tell well like I'm
bouncing my eyes back and forth between
both readouts but after watching this
over and over the h-60 does seem to run
a tad warmer there are a few times where
the h-60 drops temperatures way down to
the 40s but it's only for like a split
second before jumping back up into the
high 50s low 60s
meanwhile the H ad I sort of hovers in
the 50s trickling into the low 60s
albeit less frequently than its
competitor the other tests I ran for
today was the hitman benchmark and here
I observed similar results with the H
ATI delivering slightly better temps on
average and after about an hour of re
running these tests the behavior we're
seeing seems to be repeatable and sort
of illustrates how these two
configurations stack up in the end it
seems that CPU thermals in this case are
more limited by the size of the a iOS
thin array than the amount of airflow
passing through it which kind of makes
sense if you think about it I mean this
is why we can have passive fanless air
coolers which solely rely on their
ability to draw heat away from the CPU
and store it in their massive thin
stacks I mean personally I think we
should really be rejoicing at this
outcome since having one less fan in
your system effectively cuts the noise
emissions of your AO unit in half if of
course you don't count the pump noise
but that's generally not too big of a
deal unless you get really unlucky with
a bad pump or something like that not to
mention you're freeing up a fan header
which doesn't seem like a lot but that
can be a huge plus especially when you
consider a lot of modern small
form-factor chassé e's are starting to
ship or have been shipping with more
case fans and more fan mounts than ever
before while mini ITX motherboards are
still stuck with the same limited number
of fan headers typically you only see
two or three Mac's so I'm going to keep
close eye on this trend favoring thicker
radiators over higher airflow but until
then I'd love to hear your guys's own
experience on the matter in the comments
down below on that note I'm going to
have to cut it off here guys I know this
was a fairly quick and semi rushed video
but I've actually been studio hunting
all this week with wifey sauce which is
super exciting so hopefully more updates
to come on that very soon but at any
rate please forgive me if you find my
lack of b-roll disturbing so let's go
into it for now guys hopefully you
enjoyed the video and if you did be sure
to toss me a big fat like on it also
feel free to subscribe to the channel
for more tech stuff coming at you really
soon I promise
have it going guys and until then I'll
see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
