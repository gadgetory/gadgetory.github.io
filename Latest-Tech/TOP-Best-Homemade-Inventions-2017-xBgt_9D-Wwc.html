layer of transparent fabric not to

cheap with your contribution you could

Willie all that out anyway I move the
batteries inside I put one up front here

there of course you can see the motor
down there underneath and I have the
camera mounted up front here and in here
is the brains of it they have the motor
controller and the Raspberry Pi for the
camera and I have the RS 610 receiver
along with the battlebot relay switch

it on

philosophical we are focusing on we are
close because they believe in 2017 we
are enrolled may be a big success that's
why we have started working on this
technology from now our concept is
adaptable drone a drone that can be
converted into vehicle and vice versa
other drones are having fpv camera so it
means it can be used in a real glasses
and users can have the same feeling as

to be one of the few countries in the
world fully produced don't for
commercial purposes like delivering
tools or housing work in the meantime we
will focus on our adaptable jauntily
