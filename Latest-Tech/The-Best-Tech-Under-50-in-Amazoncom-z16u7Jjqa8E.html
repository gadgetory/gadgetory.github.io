the founder of axis drones and today I
have with me the wallet drone
Jonah's the world's smallest quadcopter
it fits inside of the controller itself
which is the size of a wallet fits
perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size the small sizer but it flew longer
than just about any other copter with
over you
the wallet drone is available in four
unique colors blue green yellow and
orange get yours today on IndieGoGo for
a simple contribution and we'll deliver
one right to your pocket
Oh
this is tile tile helps you find things
anything stick it to your laptop and
worry less attach it to your keys and
never be late drop it in your purse and
you're good to go it works very simply
finding things with tile is easy through
the tile app on your phone you can track
distance to your lost item the app shows
you as you get closer in tile has other
features too you can log into your tile
account on anyone's smartphone to search
for your items and you can also activate
a tile to ring so you can find it by
sound tile is affordable and it's tiny
you can even securely share tiles with
others using our cloud-based platform
which is great for families no matter
who you use the car lasts the keys can
always be found if your bike goes
missing you can mark it as a lost item
this puts all other tile apps on the
lookout for your tile if any tile user
gets within range of your bike their
phone will discreetly and securely
communicate with our cloud system and
you'll be sent a notification of your
bike's whereabouts let tile find the
small things so you can find the big
ones hi I'm Nick I'm bike we've both
been working in the hardware industry
for years when we had the revolutionary
idea for tile we've developed an awesome
product to help you keep track of your
stuff anytime anywhere
this was our prototype six months ago
and now tiles ready but we need your
help to make tile a reality and we need
your help to build the tile community
let's build something great together
thanks thanks
your cell phone takes great pictures but
you can only get so close now you can
see what you've been missing with easy
macro the four times magnifying lens
that fits any mobile device with a
camera so you can capture every little
detail close-up just stretch point and
click the pic from practical to
fascinating while all of your mobile
devices have the power to capture
stunningly sharp detail like never
before
easy macro is easy to use for everyone
and the possibilities are endless so
capture the detail and share it with the
world
hi guys I'm Lorenzo
hi I'm Carlo every day smartphones are
becoming smarter but the battery life
remains critical we'd like to use our
phones without the fear of running out
of battery of course there are solutions
such as power cases and extra batteries
whether you do not portable enough or is
to forget we designed a product so
compact that will follow you everywhere
a cable the size of an inch we call it
in charge it's a very simple product
it's so useful that we believe everybody
should own one that's why one of our
main goals was to keep it affordable
a tiny product at the tiny price we
spend an average 70% of our day next to
a USB port and every time it's a chance
to top-up for batteries there are over
five billion USB ports around the world
in charge will fit in your pocket and
you won't have to fight with tangle
cords
ever again thanks to its remarkably
compact design you can snap it onto your
keyring and there's no chance to forget
it at all we spent the last three months
design the product and testing the
prototypes and now we are finally ready
to start the production in charger will
be available with both lightning
connector and micro USB so it's
compatible with most of the devices out
there we are really excited about this
and we hope you are too
now we need your help to bring in charge
into your pocket
as a supporter you will get your own in
charge at a special price so please
consider backing our project and share
it with your friends thanks for watching
we really appreciate your support thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
