the founder of axis drones and today I
have with me the wallet drone
Jonah's the world's smallest quadcopter
it fits inside of the controller itself
which is the size of a wallet fits
perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size the small sizer but it flew longer
than just about any other copter with
over you
the wallet drone is available in four
unique colors blue green yellow and
orange get yours today on IndieGoGo for
a simple contribution and we'll deliver
one right to your pocket

hi guys I'm Lorenzo
hi I'm Carlo every day smartphones are
becoming smarter but the battery life
remains critical we'd like to use our
phones without the fear of running out
of battery of course there are solutions
such as power cases and extra batteries
whether you do not portable enough or is
to forget we designed a product so
compact that will follow you everywhere
a cable the size of an inch we call it
in charge it's a very simple product
it's so useful that we believe everybody
should own one that's why one of our
main goals was to keep it affordable
a tiny product at the tiny price we
spend an average 70% of our day next to
a USB port and every time it's a chance
to top-up for batteries there are over
five billion USB ports around the world
in charge will fit in your pocket and
you won't have to fight with tangle
cords
ever again thanks to its remarkably
compact design you can snap it onto your
keyring and there's no chance to forget
it at all we spent the last three months
design the product and testing the
prototypes and now we are finally ready
to start the production in charger will
be available with both lightning
connector and micro USB so it's
compatible with most of the devices out
there we are really excited about this
and we hope you are too
now we need your help to bring in charge
into your pocket
as a supporter you will get your own in
charge at a special price so please
consider backing our project and share
it with your friends thanks for watching
we really appreciate your support thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
