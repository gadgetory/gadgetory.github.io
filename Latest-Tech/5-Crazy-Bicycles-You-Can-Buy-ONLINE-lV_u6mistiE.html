say it's a feeling timeless in its
simplicity intense hypnotic addictive
yet fade isn't kind to runners injury
can strike at any time and despite all
the innovation and billions of dollars
spent on running shoes injury rates
haven't changed we thought it's time for
a different approach
so we imagined a world where machines
inspired by nature allow runners to
train without injury
a world where regular people can
rediscover the pleasure of running
without the fear of getting hurt we call
it Bionic running and it's set to
challenge conventional notions of
running training with this non impact
closed kinetic chain you can say goodbye
to awkward foot strikes say goodbye to
strains from over extension and goodbye
to impact fatigue in fact the Bionic
runner lets you train hard from day one
to rapidly reach your peak potential
while limiting the amount of actual
running you need to do you can still
perform advanced techniques like
resistance over speed intervals
threshold and fartlek training by
transferring high risk training
activities to our bike when you do run
you can focus on improving the economy
of your gait so you arrive at events
fast fit and uninjured we began our
design process by asking runners what
they love about running first they said
they loved being outdoors so we decided
it had to be a bike next they said they
loved the convenience you can run
anywhere anytime so we made it a folding
bike so you can take it in your car
wherever you run most importantly they
love the feeling and intensity of
running no other exercise comes close so
we studied running but it wasn't easy we
spent three years we built six radically
different prototypes testing theories
using science we discovered that only a
mechanism with 60 40 swing stance
facetiming
and replicate the feeling and intensity
of running this is why Bionic running
feels like running and this sets the
Bionic runner apart from all previous
non-impact cross trainers these insights
are groundbreaking and our results have
been published in peer-reviewed sports
science journals then our kids said dad
you got to make it look cool and you
can't let your kids down so we gave our
bike unique styling with a jet black
anodized finish red accents and fly cut
embossed lettering forged right into the
parts it also had to be strong so
regardless of whether you're an Ironman
or a weekend warrior our bike is
engineered to withstand the abuse of
daily use and it had to be precise all
the parts of 3d forged or extruded
machined to exacting tolerances heat
treated for strength surface finish for
protection and bonded together for
precision so whether you run for fitness
fun or competition it's time to discover
the joy of running without injury with a
bionic runner from run 4 you'll run
better with bionics
we believe that the most enjoyable
workout happens when it's combined with
adventure
the reason we've put the flying bicycle
on Kickstarter is that with your support
we can take the flying bicycle into
production and make the idea fly the
inspiration is both myself and Yannick
have always had a passion for cycling
and for aircraft of every type and both
of us have have dreamt of being pilots
and flying since we work we were kids
and one of them the biggest barriers to
flying is his cost it's expensive to
train it's expensive to maintain the
aircraft one of the beauties about the
flying bicycle is that it's accessible
and it's affordable we wanted to make
something that was accessible and
brought together both our passions for
cycling and flying and basically wanted
to something that we could ride and fly
out of our backyard you're buying a
bicycle that you can keep in the boot of
your car it's a fowling bike so you can
use it to cycle to work you can take it
on Metro on a train and you put it on a
bigger aircraft when you fly on holiday
I think the sort of person who's going
to be interested in buying the flying
bike it's somebody who has a passion for
being outdoors and getting into places
which not everybody can get to what
we're asking for from Kickstarter
supporters is to come in at this stage
of the project and to help us build the
flying bicycle into a full production
ready aircraft that you can go out and
buy and use and enjoy we've designed it
we've built it it flies we know it works
and now it's ready for full-scale
production so with your support we can
we can make that happen we think the
flying bicycle is a great idea we're
very passionate about it and we're
looking for pioneer investors who share
our dream
