people like you to live work and move
from a free base thank you hey
Kickstarter I'm Jeremy and I designed
the MOE desk office set a line of office
accessories for anyone looking to bring
style to their desk I recently
redesigned my office and as I looked
around I realized I had a well-designed
computer a modern glass whiteboard a
great printer and chair beautiful
artwork on the walls all of these things
work perfectly together with one major
exception my desk accessories I checked
out a local office supply store and only
found boring black or clear organizers
then jumped on my computer and started
searching I wanted something that was
simple and clean I also wanted something
that would complement my computer a
matte book I was certain there had to be
something out there that fit this
criteria after quite a bit of searching
I realized I was wrong I thought to
myself all of these fancy well-designed
tech products out there and I can't even
find a good desk organizer my mind
started churning and I started to sketch
up a design of what I was looking for I
thought to myself if I want something
like this then there must be other
people out there that do too I looked
into different manufacturing processes
types of alloys various finishes it was
important to me that I designed a
product that not only look
was also high quality and durable it was
also important to me that this product
was made in the US whether I was making
one or a thousand I recognized that most
the plastic or mesh organizers on the
market were made in places like Thailand
and China this wasn't what I wanted
after months of researching designing
and planning I came up with the first
line of my desk office accessories
they're made to look great in any office
with a simple modern or minimalist
design Kickstarter I need your help to
make this happen I've done my homework
the prototypes are done and
inexperienced manufacturing company is
lined up ready to go at this point we
need to raise $15,000 start the first
round of manufacturing please help by
contributing to this Kickstarter
campaign and sharing with your friends I
hope that the mo deska office set can
make your desk more inspiring and
creative space thanks for watching
like many other people I work in an
office so day to day challenges for me
are being able to concentrate and also
manage my stress but what happens is
whenever I play around or something like
a paper clip pinned or a stress ball
while I'm working I find that I can
focus better and that I'm able to manage
my stress so I did some more research
into it and I found that whenever you
have some type of resistance against
your hands while working that it can
really improve how you focus on the task
at hand
how you manage your stress how creative
you can be and it even boosts things
like circulation I was convinced so then
I did what I always do and I look for
the perfect solution I put a whole lot
of stress pause and a whole lot of
exercise equipment and what I found was
none of them provided the right amount
of resistance a lot of it wasn't durable
and just fell apart and then others were
just too silly and goofy to even have in
your office that's how office patty came
to life its moldable it's non sticky and
it provides the perfect amount of
resistance it just feels really good in
your hands what we've also done is we're
branded it and packaged it so if it's
really nicely into a corporate
environment to truly encapsulate the key
features of the brand we came up with a
tagline calm focus create because when
under stress you can calm your mind you
can enable concentration for those
difficult tasks and the use of office
paddy helps to activate the creative
areas of your brain we're bringing off
this patio Kickstarter because we'd like
to reach a wider audience build some new
distribution networks and we're also
looking to do some more work on the
packaging so please please try office
paddy and let us know what you think we
really appreciate the support
ask yourself have you ever really loved
your desk I mean really why our office
desk today well pretty much the same as
they've always been it's just four legs
holding up a piece of wood it's time to
completely redesign the office desk

exciting something extremely smart meet

it's time to rework work
you
there are so many benefits to exercise
that many of us make time to do it
during the work day or after work but we
noticed a problem that our friends and
modern professionals all share we carry
two bags to the office one for work and
one for the gym the gym bags we carry
are too sporty and not appropriate for
the workplace so we wondered what if
there was a bag that could carry both
our gym and office essentials something
we could take to the office was highly
functional and could simplify the way we
carry our things we realized that this
type of bag didn't exist so that's why
we started air this is the Aero duffel
pack it's a new kind of gym bag for
today's modern professional it's a
hybrid of a duffel and a backpack so
it's easy to pack and comfortable to
carry
at its core the duffel pack is a highly
functional gym bag the main compartment
is sealed with a waterproof zipper and
gives you full access to the interior
while the side pockets give you quick
access to smaller items on the bottom of
the bag we added a compartment for your
shoes or use clothes it's lined with the
water resistant nylon and is ventilated
helping to reduce sweat and odor buildup
even with these functional features the
duffel pack is designed for the office
on the back there's a padded compartment
for your laptop and tablet while the
additional slip pocket can be used for
magazines and books the bag is also
perfect for your commute it stays close
to your body making it ideal for crowded
spaces or when you're riding a bike
also the bags understated aesthetic is
designed to fit any modern wardrobe so
you can feel comfortable taking it to
the office
the team behind error is made up with
designers and athletes in the San
Francisco design industry we have a
history of bringing successful products
to market so you can be confident that
we'll deliver a high quality product
we're extremely proud of the hard work
that's gone into developing the double
pack but we can't launch err on our own
we need your support to find our first
production run and make the double pack
a reality together we can create a new
kind of gym bag for the modern lifestyle
and it all starts now
