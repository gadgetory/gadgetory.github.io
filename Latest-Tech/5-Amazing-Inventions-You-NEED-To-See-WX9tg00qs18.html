of the pack what if you could add
additional features that you never
thought would be possible on your mobile
device hi guys my name is ethics I'm
Kofun of next thing and what do that
phone case that will change your life
next pack is a modular smartphone case
that allows you to customize your phone
to do more and to allow you to do more
with your phone how does it work slide
your phone into the next pack case add
some modules access the app and enjoy
the unique features each module provides
we've already created 12 modules to get
you going and there's more to come
next pack is the first phone case that
allows you to switch Hardware between
Android and Apple devices this means you
can trade modules with friends and
family and experience the different
features each module provides if you do
choose to upgrade your phone all you'll
need to do is change your case and your
modules will always work with you from
the first idea it took us about two
years to arrive where we are now we were
originally inspired by brainstorming
cases that allow you to add one new
feature to your phone and we thought why
not make one case that allows for many
features that you can customize for your
lifestyle we have an experienced team
with members spread across the world all
bonded together through our passion for
next pack we've been working around the
clock to collaborate on each other's
time zones and get our device to where
it is today what comes out of this
campaign is just the beginning we are
currently working on additional modules
for the near future but even more
importantly we are building a community
for developers to thrive and meet the
needs and wants of next packet users
think about an app store for modules
that can enhance your phone whenever we
show it to someone we get some crazy
ideas for future modules what about a
tiny lip gloss or a little blush knife
isn't camera 3d camera walkie talkies to
talk with your friends good books a
fingerprint scanner a game controller a
baby monitor a lie detector for my
boyfriend you see this really is just
the beginning we need your help to fund
an ice pack to bring it to you but more
importantly we need your ideas to call
the future of next pack so if you're as
excited about next biggest we are
pledged today bless you today
you
I wanted a good keyboard and there
weren't any out there I figured well how
hard could this be and then we built the
best keyboard we possibly could it's not
what you'd expect from a keyboard but
people love it creating a keyboard is
kind of a weird thing it's been an
obsession hi I'm Jesse Vincent I'm
co-founder and CTO of keyboard EO I'm
kaya Decker I'm the CEO of cube or do
I'm also married to Jesse most people
are typing 8 plus hours a day on
uncomfortable flat plastic boxes that
are pretty much the same as they were a
hundred years ago you deserve something
better the musicians not like well just
take the plastic guitar off the shelf
it'll be fine when I'm sticking my
entire career and my you know my
professional everything on this like
they're really thinking about it I found
a bunch of research but better keyboard
layouts higher hands work and what
actually matters in keyboard design and
every keyboard designed in the last 20
years is flat-out ignored it so we built
a good keyboard the model one is
different it takes some getting used to
but it's worth it the model one is that
great sort of tool that supports the way
you want to work and it gets out of the
way unless you do the kind of work that
you couldn't have done without it and I
love the way my fingertips kind of rest
in the keys and it's easy to kezar to
reach we're trying to build a keyboard
you'll enjoy using for years we have
this gorgeous maplewood enclosure we've
sculpted the key caps to guide your
fingers to the right keys and yeah it
lights up the LEDs that glow from under
each key are actually totally
customizable and programmable originally
the butterfly shape was an accident but
we love it it feels warm it feels
friendly I bring to keep right out in
public and people look at it and say can
I touch it it's a keyboard you're
supposed to touch it that's the whole
point up till now we've been designing
and designing and design
and testing and testing and testing
we've made dozens of prototypes before
we liked one enough to call it the model
one and now we're going to make a few
thousand I spent most of my career
building open source software it was
important to us that we build an amazing
product that wasn't going to be locked
down most products get worse over time
open products get better because it's
open source hardware I know that I can
customize it to my needs and then share
those customizations with the community
you're going to get from more source
code you're going to get schematics to
the electronics you're going to get a
screwdriver even if you never touch a
line of code plenty of other type of
swill and their work will make your
keyboard better this is a tool that I
can use over the next 20 years of my
career because it's going to grow with
me and so now it's possible for us to
come to all of you and share with you
what we're making thank you for paying
attention it means a lot to us if typing
matters to you please back our

hi I'm pfl I'm 22 years old I came from
boolean the south is part of Italy I'm a
mechanic at the same time a study
engineer yes because one of my dream is
to be an engineer whatever the project
that i'm going to show you is a
redefinition of the concept of a
classical drone yes why I say this
because with a classical room you can
fly you can make videos or pictures and
later you can make nothing well with my
prototype you can make some other things
yes because the prototype of my drone is
composed by four principal parts the
cover the case with the battery and the
internal components the arms with the
motor and the propellers and the most
important parts your phone yes because
when you put your phone into the drone
with an external controller you can
drive it whatever let me show you an
example once you stop to use it like a
drone you can make one other thing what
you can remove the arms and you will lab
your phone into the cover and behind
there will be the case the case will
charge your phone without wire and you
can see ok it's good but other things
that your drone can do well when you
I'll make another example when you stop
to use your drone because the battery
execs cells you can remove the arms and
you remove the case and you will have
the cover in your end your phone into
and you will see yes but I can use my
cover yes it's okay but my cover can
charge your phone without wires by an
electrical induction platform that you
already have but that it can bring to
you well another important thing of this
new prototype is that the only pieces
internal and external are rechargeable
what I mean you have already at home
Motors order propellers you can change
it from one to another you have another
battery you can change it to in this way
the drone is what you want it's like you
want and it is way with a price often
classical drone you can make some other
thing
so if you like my project please support
me and I will thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
