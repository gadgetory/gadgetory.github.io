son Nathan I've been a engineer and
designer and inventor for about 14 years
now and I've designed a lot of knives
and multi tools that you might be
familiar with I came up with the idea
for the clacks last year over the last
six months I've been designing
developing prototyping and testing out
the clocks to end up with the floor
versions that we have here today the
clacks is more than an axe the clacks is
a multi-tool built into the head of an
axe it has a lot of useful features
carabiner thumb jimping this is the
bottle opener the axe blade the scraper
lanyard hole the hammer with a built-in
ruler five wrench sizes and a hex bit
driver the clacks has a lot of useful
features like wrenches hammer head and
scraper along with our innovative new
clamping system that allows you to take
the axe to the field and be able to
break it down for easy transport
relax is useful for people who are
involved in hiking climbing camping
survival experts people who do bushcraft
all sorts of things including emergency
preparedness I'm Mike peel for Mike Pihl
logging Vernonia Oregon and I'm a logger
the clacks it's a great tool this
morning I used it to wedge over a
Douglas fir tree and it did a good job
this is the klax lumberjack it's our
most popular model because it includes
all of the features this is the clacks
woodsman the clacks woodsman has the
clamping system carabiner hammer the axe
blade but the more rustic version that
we've created is called the clacks
feller the clacks feller attaches using
the paracord bracelet by pulling the
paracord out and wrapping it around the
handle like you would a tomahawk this is
the tie clacks the tie clacks is a
titanium version of the clocks
lumberjack it is our top of the line
model and it includes all of the
features plus it has blue anodized
highlights and it comes weighing in at
half of the weight of the feller that's
why the tie clacks
is our top of the line model we've
backed to dozen projects on our own
already we're reaching out to you the
Kickstarter community to see if you'll
help us by backing us to get the clocks
out there class thanks for watching we
appreciate your support
relax more than an axe
hi i'm mike scully creator of the lever
gear tool card I founded lever gear to
design products that solve real problems
look great and will last forever
we all have little projects that pop up
in life and they don't always happen
when our tools are handy it's annoying
to have to spend time chasing down tools
for a job that should take ten seconds
if you're like me it usually ends up
getting added to your to-do list that's
why we created the lever gear tool card
it's a multi-tool the size of a credit
card that has 40 different tools it's
always with you so you can get things
done I like to be prepared to handle any
task but I also hate the idea of
carrying around a lot of extra stuff a
credit card size tool that could
disappear in my wallet seemed like the
perfect solution we developed the tool
card with a simple premise the real
estate in your pocket is precious
so you should own stuff that's actually
worth carrying we began our design
process by brainstorming all of the
functions we could pack into a credit
card sized multi-tool we also tested
every card that existed on the market we
thought a lot about the design and
layout of the tool cart by nesting the
tools we were able to add tools and
reduce weight without sacrificing
strength we kept the edges smooth so it
feels great in your hand when you're
using the tools we chose not to have an
exposed blade so the tool card is TSA
compliant and it won't damage your
wallet instead we added a blade
protected by the can opener so you can
cut cords but not your fingers the tool
card weighs only one ounce and slips
easily into your wallet so you won't
notice it until you need it or ditch the
wallet altogether
the innovative money clip is designed to
snap on with a click and disassemble
with ease no extra tool is required
no fasteners to lose so you can quickly
switch from wallet card to money clip
tool card is made in America from blade
quality 420 stainless steel which is
then heat treated for excellent strength
and hardness
it's then bead blasted for a
professional finish and laser etched for
rich permanent graphics
the tool card makes an awesome gift that
will last a lifetime and it's scheduled
to ship before Father's Day and
graduation we've put in a lot of time to
make this tool as good as it can be
please help us by supporting our
campaign and sharing it with your
friends thank you
Hey
you
we decided to design a multi-tool that
combines all of our favorite features
into an ultra low-profile tool that we
call the titanium pocket tool this new
tool is made from aerospace grade five
titanium alloy
despite its minimal name and appearance
this new pocket tool is extremely
versatile and lets us do more careless
hi Kickstarter's I'm Joe
I'm Chadwick we're excited to be back
here with our news project the titanium
pocket tool it's a cool multi-tool that
combines our favorite tools into one and
it doesn't take hardly any space in your
pocket thanks for checking it out
thanks for watching the video and share
with your friends if you have any
questions please send us message we'll
be happy to get back to you as soon as
we can thank you thank you hey I'm Nate
par creator of the pocket monkey here
today to tell you about my latest
creation wild card the pocket knife
needs to evolve it's an essential tool
but it's bulky it's one more thing to
remember in the morning and it easily
falls out of your pocket and is lost I
wanted something better
I asked why not put a pocket knife in my
wallet it'd be easier to carry and
harder to lose so I set out to design a
knife that be as thin as possible and
the result is wild fun it's only two
millimeters thick only slightly thicker
than a credit card I was able to do this
by reimagining the blade pivot most
knives have a pin pressed through a hole
wild card has a pivot unlike anything in
the world I call it fly off technology
the three wings of the pivot allow the
knife blade to remain rigid to the body
a necessity when wielding a sharp tool
for safety I designed the blade to lock
open and to lock closed the blade tucks
neatly under two blade guards and it
angles only on one side so users can't
accidentally cut themselves when
carrying a closed knife and here's the
best part about this design the blade is
detachable I designed this with the
forgetful traveler in mind when you go
through TSA with your traditional knife
on you you lose your knife but with wild
card you only lose your blade and on our
website you can replace it for only a
few dollars with pocket monkey I used a
monkey to represent the personality of
the tool with wild card I kept that
trend going wild card has a wolf cutout
that doubles as a bottle of the wolf and
body is the nature of the tool agile yet
powerful I wanted to pack as much
functionality as possible into wild card
many people misuse knives in place of
other tools like screwdrivers and pry
bars harming themselves of break into
knives so I added these tools
I always wanted to challenge convention
because of that I spent the last six
months trying to reinvent how this
product is manufactured every
manufacturer I talked with was hesitant
to produce such an aggressive design the
solution I kept hearing was take this to
China but that isn't something that I'm
willing to do I want to create products
that embody the American spirit of
innovation and my solution was to create
a manufacturing facility in Maine
now we control every aspect of
production from laser cutting to
packaging and shipping so we can
manufacture the highest-quality product
while creating jobs in our community
help us make wild car to reality and
help us continue the American spirit of
innovation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
