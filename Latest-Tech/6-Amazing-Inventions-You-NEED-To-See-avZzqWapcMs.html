what challenges do most commuters have
in common they need a bag to store their
daily needs and deal with a constant
rush traffic jams walking miles to get
to public transportation or having to
carry more than just a backpack are all
challenges commuters have in common this
is why we created the best solution for
the urban commuter a backpack that you
can wear roll and ride
meet the all-new move back we've we
engineered move back to implement not
one but two motors inside the wheel this
makes me fat more powerful and safer
than ever before combined with a
beautiful and clean design we took the
time to do what we do best redesigning
re prototyping re-engineering basically
reinventing so we could bring back to
you our best product yet with our
exclusive app you will be able to
connect your phone wirelessly to move
back and with the new built-in speaker
and mic you can speak to move pack
directly like asking for directions turn
right on straight and since move pack
comes equipped with a powerful speaker
why not connect to your favorite app and
listen to your favorite playlist while
on the go
mopac provides a built-in USB charger
that can charge your phone over 10 times
on top of that move pack will now have
built-in tracking capability for
security in case your move pack gets
stolen or lost
every little detail is important such as
internal lighting that will come in
handy when looking for something in the
bag and as far as the backpack itself
goes not only is its swappable with
different colors and styles but now you
can wear your favorite backpack
independently of the moon pad
move pack is one of
easiest vehicles to master and you don't
have to be a skateboarder to write just
stand on the board using the backpack
for extra support and use the remarkably
small remote for speed and braking and
in case of an emergency move pack is
pretty easy to get off
so there you have it a backpack a
personal transportation a smart luggage
and a personal assistant if you were to
buy all that separately you would spend
well over two thousand dollars but with
move pack you'll save over fifty percent
of that through this exclusive
crowdfunding campaign
you
we are thrilled to announce the most
important parts of move pack are ready
and with your support we can give our
manufacturers the thumbs up and start
the mass production and get the move
pack shipping to you soon join us for
the ride and together we will change the
way the world moves around
the entire
Thanks is coming to the tobacco industry
ouch guard is the first sports news box
a box that will automatically lock
itself to protect its content from you
it does not give you power it gives you
freedom by taken it away
you
how much freedom can you fit in a bag
the freedom of knowledge
the freedom share
freedom to dream freedom of movement now
it fits with linky
mobility is free with linky strong
patented folding mechanism its freedom
in your bag it's a last mile mobility
solution that means no more traffic no
more bus timetables no more pollution
linky represents a new generation in
electric mobility with it we want to
improve the way we experience cities the
team behind linky is a group of
passionate travelers wherever we were in
the world we found ourselves wanting a
mode of transportation that is eco
sustainable easy to carry around and
really fun to ride with technical
engineering and sales backgrounds we've
studied last mile mobility and made
linky to fill a gap in that market but
also in our own lives nothing out there
is truly portable so that's why we need
linky to fit in a bag
one thing that distinguishes link is the
incredible pride with taking attentions
to detail we have worked for two years
to perfect the patented mechanical
system that expands and contracts link
based on our experience in automotive
design our structure uses a layer system
polymers and carbon fiber for a perfect
balance between likeness and rigidity
weighing just 4.9 keema's it's really
sturdy we have put one hundred and sixty
kilos only and we have ridden hundreds
of kilometers my experience in the
electric car industry is the inspiration
behind the electronics and the battery
of linking we wanted to be able to bring
blinky on an aeroplane so we've chosen a
fast-charging long life lithium-ion
battery that respects iata regulation
for air travel
safety is our number one priority in
designing linkage powertrain and battery
management solutions we've optimized for
power performance and wait linka
Chargers to eighty-five percent of its
capacity in just half an hour with
linking you can ride 15 kilometers climb
up ten percent slopes and reach up to 30
km/h link is made by hand by one person
who follows the project from start to
finish we are ready to go into
production but we need a minimum number
of orders to make this possible your
support right now we left keep costs
down so we can guarantee a great level
of service and a truly exciting electric
longboard
you
you
you

that ball was fast right but how fast
was incomplete
hi this is Scotty the world's first
smart speed radar but let me reduce
myself as well my name is Mika I was a
baseball feature and a member of the
Slovenian national baseball team so I
spent most of my childhood based on the
field an explosive fastball can get a
picture into college and help him enter
the professional baseball arena so it's
extremely important that baseball
pitchers be able to throw hard today
people need tons of equipment to record
reaching speeds and other parameters of
the pitch to ride them down and to
record video we believe players parents
coaches and scouts deserve a simple and
intuitive solution to be able to record
performance and track progress every
single day that's why we created Scouty
the world's first smart speed radar
Scotty measures the speed of the ball
and transfers the collected data to an
app on your smartphone or a tablet
within the app you can select the type
location and result of the pinch the app
saves all the data so you can track your
progress over time you can even record a
video of your pitching technique with
peach data over late and share your
talent with friends coaches and scouts
for the last year we've been working
hard to make Scout to become a reality
our award-winning design team designs
coffee from scratch it players needs in
mind we created a small and robust
device that is always with you whether
you are at home or on the road we shrunk
the entire radar technology into this
little box to achieve this we work
closely with number of radio frequency
and signal processing experts the result
is a state-of-the-art Doppler radar
solution that is as accurate and
reliable as the best traders on the
market Scouty is a great training tool
so accurate and so reliable you can use
it for both trainings and games or just
playing catching the backyard
now we need your help to hit one out of
the ballpark we need your support to
finish the tooling repair for production
and handle the certification process if
you like scouting please back us or
share our campaign and help us
revolutionize baseball oh and one more
thing Scotty works with any ball</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
