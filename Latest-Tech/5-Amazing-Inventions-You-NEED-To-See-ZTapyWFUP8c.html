mobile phones make our life simple and
easy but sometimes we have annoying
problems with the mobile chargers trying
to plug it in a couple of times before
you get it right accidentally damaging
your phone connecting your phone when
your hands are busy damaging your cables
unable to charge your phone fast enough
from the laptop earlier this year we
start attacking this challenge and we
have come up with a very elegant
solution inspired by that evolutionary
macbook charger introducing the magnetic
connected for your mobile devices the
moline connect it has two parts the pen
and the connector the pin fits into your
device and the connected to your charger
the connector automatically fits into
place fast charge your phone with a
simple slide of a button with mutant
simply connect your phone charge your
phone without being distracted from your
work
charge your phone up to twice as fast
when connected to laptop or while
driving
prevent any unwanted accidents from
damaging your phone and no more fitting
in the dark
mu connect is designed to look elegant
we have made it simple and compact to
achieve this we custom-design many of
the parts and made various prototypes
the greatest advantage of this compact
size is that it is unobtrusive and it
goes with any phone case you might have
so you don't have to get your favorite
case we have finished our prototyping
and testing and now we need your help to
take it to manufacturing so that the
product can reach you
I came up with the idea for a translator
when I met a French girl that's really
where the story starts I was on vacation
and i met this girl it was difficult for
us to communicate because she didn't
speak english very well and even when we
tried to find a solution like using some
translation app to communicate it's
horrible look if you're not speaking and
our phones are in a face like this
forget it this is the wolf we're out of
this real-world interaction but this in
your ear just right back in it Lil D put
this in your here is my cell no no hey i
put in here cancer yeah okay can you
hear me in French vive me all told hole
faucet it was a nobody will say yes I
can hear you talk French miss but this
is awesome but how you do it yeah it's
translating translating
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other here is it
in their language developing the pilot
has been an intensive process our team's
been working on in over two years andrew
is our original co-founder and overseas
prior development I'm an electrical
engineer and expert and manufacturing we
also have mechanical engineer software
engineer PhD and machine translation as
well as an industrial designer our wide
breadth of experts has allowed us to
develop a product from the ground up we
wanted to create something that hugs the
curves of the year without being
obtrusive something snug but fashionable
to wear in the process we just decided
to throw in an extra earpiece for
wireless ringing music that means the
full system includes two earpieces and
its accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the earpiece it's kind of an
end-all solution for the traveler or the
international professional that's what
we're doing here at Waverly laughs it's
simply the most advanced communication
wearable
they say IndieGoGo campaign helps us
finish what we started we can get the
ear pieces along with this portable
charger manufactured in delivered within
a year the app works on its own if you
just want to use the app for basic
translation and we'll have the app out
by late summer first for our backers
here on IndieGoGo but for the full
experience you really want the ear
pieces too it's the dream you know a
life untethered free of language
barriers it's just that it's no longer
dream anymore it's real
