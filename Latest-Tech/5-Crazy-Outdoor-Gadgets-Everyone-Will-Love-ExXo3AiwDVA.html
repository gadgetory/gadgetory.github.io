doesn't matter if I'm in the park next
door on the boat trip with my friends or
at the peak of the mountain on the other
side of the world in the end I think
it's all about chasing these rare
moments when you're totally at ease with
yourself I find these moments in nature
and quite frequently it might be loved
hammock honestly is there a way not to
be laid-back while floating between two
palm trees as a matter of fact there is
mosquitoes for example experts in mood
turn even worse falling coconuts and of
course rain the ark enemy of hammock
lovers around it look sad but true
chemical ava's sometimes do live an
uncomfortable and dangerous life in
order to change that we have created the
flying tent it's a complete redesign of
what a hammock can be you can use it
with the mosquito net if it starts
raining sip up the rain cover and you
will find yourself relaxing in a
waterproof floating tent you can also
set it up on the ground as a BB tent or
in case you really decide to walk on in
the rain you can easily convert the
hammock into a fancy rain poncho with
this key on your backpack there are
simply no more excuses for not enjoying
the outdoors as outdoor enthusiasts will
have the simplicity of the flying tender
but it took us two years to get there
the biggest challenge was to merge all
these functions into one smart product
that allows small packaging without
compromising its functionality we
actually had to invent a completely new
mechanism that didn't exist before it
even allowed us to apply for a patent
and it allows you to set up the tent in
just around seven seconds at the same
time unlike most other tents the flight
end fits into this tiny little bag and
only weighs about one kilogram this
makes it one of the smartest and
lightest outdoor gears that you can
possibly get
it consists of high-quality waterproof
materials and it comes with all kinds of
useful features that make your outdoor
adventures even more enjoyable it's been
an amazing journey since the idea of the
flying tent was born our passion and
team was able to come up with a truly
unique product that exceeds all our
initial expectations for the last step
