on some parts like it feels like it's
you're moving forward into another world
it's tripping me out right now just
watching this the music and the visuals
and everything that's what people go to
shows and festivals for and now with the
laser doc you can actually take that
element back home with you and throw
that in your apartment your loft or
house or whatever and really give a
different element to your house party it
can bounce along with the music and
because the patterns continue to change
it constantly evolves with the song so
it follows the musical Germany's all the
different patterns are super psychedelic
really cool if you're slightly off
balanced while looking at this thing I
think you'll be getting a very very
interesting display of lights and visual
entertainment just you have a big
build-up coming up in a drop the lights
gonna reflect that the laser is going to
shoot something out and totally blow the
audience lines the animations are really
reacted to music it also works well all
kinds of different music things awesome
on the stage and it's even good if
you're just throwing a house party just
hanging out and bite some people over
play some loud music and it will dance
with you the patterns are awesome the
colors are awesome super fresh super
unique it's wicked really made a tea
party the best party over
we're Alpine laps over the last four
years we've kick-started for products
that expand your camera's capabilities
and now we've built the best remote
trigger we can imagine this is pulse the
most powerful way to control your camera
from your smartphone
also lets you take a photo without
having to touch or shake your camera so
you can get sharp images in any
conditions or capture moments where you
can't be next to your camera but pulse
isn't just a trigger it gives you all
the functionality you expect from
shooting with your DSLR or mirrorless
camera but remotely from your smartphone
you can change all of your camera
settings through the app or just check
your histogram and make sure everything
is looking good unlike other triggers
pulse lets you start and stop video too
and because you can control up to three
cameras at once you can get all the
right angles for your shot even if you
are just a team of one pulse is also the
most powerful time-lapse trigger on the
market so if you are taking your very
first time lapse or getting the holy
grail of timelapses a data night
transition we've designed pulse to give
you maximum control we started Alpine
labs because kickstarter backers like
you believed in our ideas initially we
were inspired to make better tools for
time arms and this year we started
focusing on camera control and remote
triggers the products out there were
either cheap or lacked functionality and
some solutions just wouldn't fit in our
camera bags we wanted a product that was
sleek fit beautifully with your camera
and give you complete control wherever
you were shooting so we got to work and
design pulse your support gives us the
ability to build the best products we
can imagine and to continue to work on
new ideas from all of us at Alpine labs
thank you
hi I'm Lauren and 11 Munich in a cozy
apartment with my roommate novena hi I'm
Jana I also live in munich I've been
Lauren's best friend since first grade
over the past three years we have been
planning testing and building a pre
prototype of an electric vehicle called
sign the cool thing about scientists
that it has solar panels on the entire
colony so the Sun recharges the battery
during the day even if it's cloudy we
use polycarbonate to protect the solar
cells polycarbonate has the advantage of
being unbreakable and scratch resistant
and it's even lighter than glass with a
total area of 7.5 square meters solar
cells recharge the battery up to 30
kilometers day conditionally to the
normal range this car is perfect for
commuter who dress every single day to
his work in the evening the country or
for a capping lover because the sign
supports bi-directional charging so can
plug in all your electronic devices you
have just imagine you have electricity
wherever you are now worries about the
range now worries about the cloths or
even just for your everyday work the
sign provides your working tools but the
power output of up to two kilowatts
another useful feature is our system
called Reese oh no it guarantees cheap
maintenance
due to very cheap spare parts online you
can get solutions download 3d data or
just order the part which needs to be
fixed and get it delivered to your home
by impartial servers finally unbox and
exchange the damaged part within easy to
use instruction manual and video
tutorials however this doesn't mean you
have to repair the sign on your own
because everyone has access to this
repair manual it will guarantee you a
dependable service network from the
beginning with small business and brand
independent car repair shops all over
the world for the interior we developed
a system called pre zonal the special
thing about it we use a certain mosques
it is integrated into the vents and acts
as a natural air filter using
electromagnetic charge this mosque
filters out pollution light fine dust
produced by the industry and combustion
engines it really requires no care since
this plant draws its water from the air
it is also soundproofing and assigned in
the fire protection class b1 and the
best thing is we offer two different
models at a price of Monell extender for
sixteen thousand euro with range of 250
kilometers and model urban for twelve
thousand euro were range of 120
kilometers we started to build this car
for years ago on order the garage with a
lot of passion and only one aim to save
the environment it's not just about the
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide coming
out of your exhaust it's about a gas
flaring worldwide while extracting oil
where gas gets burned 24-7 rather than
getting used every year 400 million tons
of carbon emissions of let into the
atmosphere accounting for roughly one
percent of global carbon emissions debts
as matches or cars in the UK France
Germany limit together it's about the
company's polluting our earth without
significant consequences it's about you
and me being
handling oil and everyday situations we
want to see some changes but you can't
do it without you you can support us
with a non-binding pre-order of the sine
x 600 hero with the money of this crowd
honey campaign we will produce several
production-ready prototypes so that
every supporter can test-drive the sign
and early 2017 after the test drive each
donor has a choice to purchase
assignment this preset strategy enables
us the production of the sign and large
quantities so let's build this car for
all of us to see some changes
you
in this modern fast-paced world people
have been sacrificing great quality
coffee and flavor of instant diluted
coffee but what if you could have savory
delicious coffee every day at your home
cold your coffee is coffee brewed using
cold or room temperature water instead
of hot water because it is slowly
dripped over time it retains the rich
flavor of the coffee that's naturally
sweet and smooth texture you can't get
with any other method of brewing the
cold temperature of the water extracts
the exquisite flavors of the coffee
beans leaving behind the bitter
undesired elements normally found in hot
coffee as a result it's much less acidic
than hot from coffee healthier and
easier on the stomach as well
unfortunately there's been no truly easy
way to brew cold drip coffee until now I
would like to introduce you to a simple
and elegant way to prune cold drip
coffee the bean plus called Rick brewer
great coffee starts with gray coffee
beans with bean plus you have the power
to choose your own favorite beans to
create your perfect brew bean plus is
crafted using quality eco-friendly
materials including same 'less steel and
heat-resistant glass it's sleek airtight
design provides the most hygienic way to
brew cold drip coffee all the while
maintaining consistent brew temperature
within the machine
bean + s signature feature is its
patented adjustable drip valve it
utilizes a built-in water filter to
adjust the drip speed providing a
constant drip rate and guaranteeing
absolute flavor satisfaction unlike any
other drip machines currently on the
market every single drip adds to the
richness of the coffee and brews the
most flavorful and mouth-watering cup
that you'll just have to taste to
believe the coffee extract can be served
cold over a glass of iced or hot in your
favorite mug making cold brew perfect
for any season you can easily store the
coffee extract using a lid by removing
the glass server on the machine you can
attain even richer flavor by letting it
age in the fridge for a day or two this
beam plus is an upgraded version of our
previous model with improvements made
reflecting our highly valued user
feedback we've lined up our manufacturer
ready to go we just need your help and
bringing bean + cold drip brewer to mass
production coffee brewed right one drip
at a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
