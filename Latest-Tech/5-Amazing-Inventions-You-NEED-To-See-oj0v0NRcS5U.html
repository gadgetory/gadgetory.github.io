on some parts like it feels like it's
you're moving forward into another world
it's tripping me out right now just
watching this the music and the visuals
and everything that's what people go to
shows and festivals for and now with the
laser dock you can actually take that
element back home with you and throw
that in your apartment your loft or
house or whatever and really give a
different elements at your house parties
it can bounce along with the music and
because the patterns continue to change
it constantly evolves with the song so
it follows the musical Germany's all the
different patterns are super psychedelic
really cool if you're slightly off
balanced while looking at this thing I
think you'll be getting a very very
interesting display of lights and visual
entertainment just you have a big build
up coming up and it drop the lights
gonna reflect that the laser is gonna
shoot something out and totally blow the
audience lines the animations are really
reactive to music it also works well
with all kinds of different music things
awesome on the stage and it's even good
if you're just throwing a house party
just hanging out and bite some people
over place and loud music and it'll
dance with you the patterns are awesome
the colors are awesome super fresh super
unique it's we could really make a tea
party the best party ever
we're alpine laps over the last four
years we've kick-started for products
that expand your camera's capabilities
and now we've built the best remote
trigger we can imagine this is pulse the
most powerful way to control your camera
from your smartphone
also lets you take a photo without
having to touch or shake your camera so
you can get sharp images in any
conditions or capture moments where you
can't be next to your camera but pulse
isn't just a trigger it gives you all
the functionality you expect from
shooting with your DSLR or mirrorless
camera but remotely from your smartphone
you can change all of your camera
settings through the app or just check
your histogram and make sure everything
is looking good unlike other triggers
pulse lets you start and stop video too
and because you can control up to 3
cameras at once you can get all the
right angles for your shot even if you
are just a team of one pulse is also the
most powerful time-lapse trigger on the
market so if you are taking your very
first time lapse or getting the holy
grail of time lapses a day to night
transition we've designed pulse to give
you maximum control we started alpine
labs because Kickstarter backers like
you believed in our ideas initially we
were inspired to make better tools for
time-lapse and this year we started
focusing on camera control and remote
triggers the products out there were
either cheap or lacked functionality and
some solutions just wouldn't fit in our
camera bags we wanted a product that was
sleek fit beautifully with your camera
and gave you complete control wherever
you were shooting so we got to work and
design for your support gives us the
ability to build the best products we
can imagine and to continue to work on
new ideas from all of us at Alpine labs
thank you
hi I'm Lauren and 11 Munich in a cozy
apartment with my roommate novena hi I'm
Jana I also live in Munich
I've been Lauren's best friend since
first grade over the past three years we
have been planning testing and building
a pre prototype of an electric vehicle
called Sian
the cool thing about scientists that it
has solar panels on the entire Cavani so
the Sun recharges the battery during the
day even if it's cloudy we use
polycarbonate to protect the solar cells
polycarbonate has the advantage of being
unbreakable and stretch resistant and
it's even lighter than glass with a
total area of 7 point 5 square meters
solar cells recharge the battery up to
30 kilometers a day conditionally to the
normal range this car is perfect for
commuter who dress every single day to
his work in the evening the comet or for
a camping lover because the science
supports bi-directional charging and
Sarah can plug in all your electronic
devices you have just imagine you have
electricity
wherever you are no worries about the
range
no worries throughout the class or even
just for your everyday work the sign
provides you working tools but the power
output of up to two kilowatts another
useful feature is our system called
Rosanna
it guarantees cheap maintenance costs
due to very cheap spare parts online you
can get solutions download free data or
just order the part which needs to be
fixed and get it delivered to your home
by impossible servers finally unbox and
exchange the damaged part with an
easy-to-use instruction manual and video
tutorials however this doesn't mean you
have to repair the sign on your own
because everyone has access to this
repair manual it will guarantee you a
dependable service network from the
beginning with small business and brand
independent car repair shops all over
the world for the interior we developed
a system called prison the special thing
about it we use a certain moss
it is integrated into the vents and acts
as a natural air filter using
electromagnetic charge this moss filters
out pollution like fine dust produced by
the industry and combustion engines it
really requires no care since this plant
draws its water from the air
it is also soundproofing and assigned in
the fire protection Class B one and the
best thing is we offer two different
models at a price of model extender for
sixteen thousand euro with range of 250
kilometres and model urban for twelve
thousand euro per range of hundred and
twenty kilometers we started to build
this car four years ago an orderly
garage with a lot of passion and the
only one aim to save the environment
it's not just about the carbon dioxide
and nitrous oxide coming out of yer
exhaust it's about a gas flaring
worldwide while extracting oil where a
gas gets burned 24/7 rather than getting
used every year four hundred million
tons of carbon emissions of led into the
atmosphere accounting for roughly one
percent of global carbon emissions
deaths s matches or cast in the UK
France Germany made together it's about
the companies polluting our earth
without significant consequences
it's about you and me being dependent on
oil and everyday situations we want to
see some changes but you can't do it
without you you can support us with a
non-binding pre-order of the sign price
at 100 here only where the money of this
crowdfunding campaign we will produce
several production ready prototypes so
that every supporter can test on the
sign in early 2017 after the test-drive
each donor has a choice to purchase
assignment this preset strategy enables
us the production of the sign and large
quantities so let's build this car for
all of us to see some changes
in this modern fast-paced world people
have been sacrificing great quality
coffee and flavor of instant diluted
coffee but what if you could have savory
delicious coffee every day at your home
called your coffee is coffee brewed
using cold or room temperature water
instead of hot water because it is
slowly dripped over time it retains the
rich flavor of the coffee if it's
naturally sweet and smooth texture you
can't get it with any other method of
brewing the cold temperature of the
water extracts the exquisite flavors of
the coffee beans leaving behind the
bitter undesired elements normally found
in hot coffee as a result it's much less
acidic than hot brewed coffee healthier
and easier on the stomach as well
unfortunately there's been no truly easy
way to brew cultured coffee until now I
would like to introduce you to a simple
and elegant way to prune called ripped
coffee the bean plus called rip brewer
great coffee starts with great coffee
beans with bean plus you have the power
to choose your own favorite beans to
create your perfect brew
bean plus is crafted using quality
eco-friendly materials including same
'less steel and heat-resistant glass
it's sleek airtight design provides the
most hygienic way to brew cold drip
coffee all the while maintaining
consistent brew temperature within the
machine
bean plusses signature feature is its
patented adjustable drip valve it
utilizes a built-in water filter to
adjust the drip speed providing a
constant drip rate and guaranteeing
absolute flavor satisfaction unlike any
other drip machines currently on the
market every single drip adds to the
richness of the coffee and brews the
most flavorful and mouth-watering cup
you'll just have to taste to believe the
coffee extract can be served cold over a
glass of iced or hot in your favorite
mug making cold brew perfect for any
season you can easily store the coffee
extract using a lid by removing the
glass server on the machine you can
attain even richer flavor by letting it
age in the fridge for a day or two this
bean plus is an upgraded version of our
previous model with improvements made
reflecting our highly valued user
feedback we've lined up our manufacturer
ready to go we just need your help in
bringing bean plus cold drip brewer to
mass production coffee brewed right one
drip at a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
