and I'm back with a new video of Samsung
Galaxy Note 7
what does for 30 minutes in the previous
video a lot of guys are complaining
about adding no common grease to the
video and by this time you guys probably
know why I didn't add my voice to the V
because it's absolutely horrible to
listen so after reading all those
commentaries I decided to go with my
voice and yeah Here I am with my voice
and this is the best I can do so I don't
know whether it's good for listening or
not so you have of the talking let's
move on with the test
I have 1.5 liter of water with me and a
good container so I guess this is the
only thing we need for the water test
so let's stab the stopwatch and then we
can post some water
oh it's all spread to the home screen so
let's go ahead and try to chain on time
again wow it's not working
so guys I think something galaxies not
support the touch inside water so
actually I have not at the time so let's
let's see what happened after 30 minutes
it's almost 30 35 minutes so let's take
out the phone and check whether all the
things are working very well so I have
some tissue papers with me inside
so let's move this container actually
it's really here so guys let's go ahead
and check the song first we'll play some
video in youtube I think you guys heard
that it's working properly there's no
defect with the song so let's go ahead
and check the camera so I have yeah
camera is also good and now let's check
the s-pen well there is any water
content inside the pen or the slot for
the s-pen oh guys
the S Pen is wet yeah so there is what
are inside this load so water can get
inside the slope but I think there's no
there will be no problem with the
hardware because I think it's filled
inside the sponge load you can see it's
full of water let me wipe it out yeah
check it once more
yeah that's it so I guess Samsung Galaxy
II not some in house survived the threat
against the water dress
I don't know whether you guys notice
feet or note when we started the what it
is the back clip was made was 92 paws
leash now it's 88 so in like 43 minutes
fall pose and it is done I mean that's
been poor so I believe Samsung Galaxy
Note 7 has really poor battery life so
that's guys I hope you enjoy my video
