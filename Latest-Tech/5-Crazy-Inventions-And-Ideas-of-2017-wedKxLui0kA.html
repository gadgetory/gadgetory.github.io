I love to drink coffee in the morning I
have to have it when I wake up but I
don't like carrying around a big travel
mug and I don't like using all these
disposable coffee cups stow Joe is the
answer it's a cup for coffee for tea for
any beverage and it collapses into a
little disc that's completely sealed so
you can put it away in your bag a
backpack your pocket and take it out
again to use later a couple years ago I
was sitting with some friends having
coffee and we had this idea a few days
later they sent me these 2d drawings and
from there we kind of just went I knew
that we could make this thing we made it
a point to keep the design simple three
main parts are made from food grade
materials you can easily take them apart
and wash them in the dishwasher or by
hand and when they're put back together
they create a liquid tight seal
we think you're really gonna like this
product save some space help the planet
have more fun with your cup
