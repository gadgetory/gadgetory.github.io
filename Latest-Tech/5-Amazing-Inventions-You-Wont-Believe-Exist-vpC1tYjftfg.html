to other microscopes
let's take a closer look it's
astonishing how this small microscope
can enlarge the target by up to 400
times its original size the nurugo
microscope
not only can it be use for research and
education but it can also be utilized in
fields that require a microscope such as
work and everyday lives the two key
factors for producing the
high-resolution image are the lens and
the lighting the lens is capable of
enlarging the target by up to 400 times
its original size and this lighting
technology has also been patented you
can also get video without any
additional batteries or cables
