lowest possible par consumption and the
maximum torque to push in most of
ordinary buttons in fact you don't even
need a smartphone use it which is
largest part of us is between two
microphones and it's what automates them

I'd like to introduce you all to a very
exciting and interesting thing now I've
put a lot of thought and research into
ways of seeing small and delicate things
with the naked eye as you can see
traditional microscopes are big and
heavy they can only be used in certain
places but now the perfect microscope
has been invented let me introduce you
to the new guru go microscope it's very
easy to use you can just mount on the
back of your smartphone there are no
cords and no additional batteries since
it's a small microscope you can utilize
it anywhere and anytime now let's take a
look at this small microscopes amazing
performance as you can see here well
can't be seen with the naked eye can
easily be verified with this product and
the image is a high resolution compared
to other microscopes
let's take a closer look it's
astonishing how this small microscope
can enlarge the target by up to 400
times its original size the nurugo
microscope
not only can it be use for research and
education but it can also be utilized in
fields that require a microscope such as
work and everyday lives the two key
factors for producing the
high-resolution image are the lens and
the lighting the lens is capable of
enlarging the target by up to 400 times
its original size and this lighting
technology has also been patented you
can also get video without any
additional batteries or cables
everyone had an amazing response when I
upload the videos and images taken by an
arugula microscope on SNS if you simply
and easily want the best results
anywhere and anytime
nurugo microscope is the answer I really
like my new go microscope new Duggal
