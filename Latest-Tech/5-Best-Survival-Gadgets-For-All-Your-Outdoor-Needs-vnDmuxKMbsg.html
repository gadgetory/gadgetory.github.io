something comes along that works so damn
well that you don't need to fuss over
appearances it reminds us that above all
else we just want something useful
Jason freed said you need to get the
fundamentals right fun wears off
cool wears off useful never wears off
when we're rolling down the highway of
our
lives what is it we want people to see a
rebel a trendsetter a man of wealth and
taste there's a funny old saying from
Mark Twain that goes clothes make the
man naked people have little or no
influence in society
but sometimes designers come along who
are the rebels they remind us that above
all else we just want something that can
be used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
