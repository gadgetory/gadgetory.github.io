a stem it adapts so you don't have to
travelin it's one of the most rewarding
things about being the life holding
around bulky luggage not so much
traveling is supposed to feel like an
adventure but most of the time your big
bags just get in the way they're costly
to check at the airport you end up
having to wait around for them and they
may even get lost or worse stolen and
for what to spend a good part of your
trip lugging around a bag stuffed with
dirty clothes you didn't even need
anyways well what if there was a better
way to travel what have we told you you
could travel anywhere in the world and
you wouldn't need anything more than a
small carry-on backpack hi IndieGoGo I'm
Dan and I'd like to introduce you to
unbound two shirts and two pairs of
socks and two pairs of underwear that
will drastically reduce the amount of
stuff you pack wherever you go that's
because our clothes never smell and they
stay clean and fresh even if you wear
them every single day in fact I've been
wearing this shirt here for 46 days in a
row same with the socks and underwear
now I know what you're thinking but
these clothes are just as clean and
fresh as the first day I put them on
that's right over a month of putting
these clothes through everything from
wearing them daily to the office out to
dinner worn to bed even the gym and most
importantly it's what I took with me as
I recently traveled to China and
Thailand for a two-week trip like that
the old me would usually pack two weeks
worth of clothes that's a lot of stuff
but with unbound I can travel light fast
and free because I have less stuff how
do we do this
merino wool merino is an absolute game
changer and it excels over cotton and
synthetics in every single way its
antibacterial its odor resistant it's a
natural body temperature regulator
keeping you warm when it's cold and
staying light and breathable when it's
hot and it quickly pulls sweat away from
your body where it can evaporate unlike
cotton that absorbs sweat where it
becomes a breeding ground for odor
causing bacteria until now merino has
traditionally been used for sporty
looking height before
we're which means it's not the type of
stuff most people want to wear outside
of the gym it's also really expensive we
took all the benefits of merino and used
it to create stylish staples that fit
and look great for everyday use simple
and versatile clothing that could be one
for a stroll through the market or
dressed up and worn out for a nice
dinner
and because we're cutting out retailers
and selling directly to you we're able
to sell our merino shirts socks and
underwear for a fraction of the price
unbound merino is the travel hack of all
travel hacks say goodbye to checking
luggage or waiting at the luggage
carousel or worrying about keeping your
stuff safe and say hello to what travels
all about the ocean and drinking from a
coconut for the past year we've been
working tirelessly with designers wool
farmers and garment makers to make the
perfect travel clothing we secured great
manufacturers but order to make our
minimum order quantity we'll need your
help the prototypes have been finalized
and tested and everything's ready to go
as soon as this campaign ends having
said that the production run will cost
us $30,000 and we can't do it without
your support we hope you'll support our
campaign Cheers

every single day on this planet someone
is injured or killed by a landmine
removing them is very time-consuming and
dangerous millions of landmines
leathered landscapes of the world turn
countries around the world
my name is Massoud ahsani and I want to
change this our mission is to solve the
landmine problems within 10 years in
2012 we have launched our first
Kickstarter campaign it is called the
mine kafon a low-cost wind powered anti
landmine detonator
it rolls along on a desert when it hits
a landmine it blows itself up and
storage the landmine in the same time
after three years of hard work we
brought our mission to the next level
now we are very excited to introduce you
our newest robotic invention the man
cave and Rome it is an airborne de
mining system which aims to reduce
landmines in less than 10 years globally
mine kafon drone flies above a dangerous
area it generates a 3d map then it
detects landmines with a metal detector
and GPS coordinates the drone has a
robotic arm which places detonators on
top of a landmine and blows them up from
a safe distance
these three methodologies combined makes
the mine kafon drones up to 20 times
faster than the traditional technologies
at the saver and up to 200 times cheaper
imagine if we could fly with hundred of
mine kafon drones all over the affected
landscapes worldwide and freed the world
from landmines
now it's our final goal to bring the
microphone drones to a pilot in order to
be able to test them on different
environments and weather conditions this
is needed to prove and show to the
demining organizations that the monofin
drone is faster cheaper and safer than
the existing technologies with such a
deceptive approach we could save
thousands of lives
we need your support to make this happen
please join our campaign and let's have
a landmine free world because one less
landmine means one save life you're
looking forward to collaborate with you
