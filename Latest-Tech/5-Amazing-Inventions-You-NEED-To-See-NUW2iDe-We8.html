founders of never bother at some point
we've all felt uncomfortable due to the
hot weather even if room is equipped
with air conditioner the cooling engine
often can't cope and of course each of
us wants to set the temperature
comfortable for himself we discussed
this and came up with the idea of
creating a personalized solution we
created evil polar the world's first
portable air conditioner design for
personal use it can be used to enjoy
cool and moist air exactly where you
need it your pork achieve is going
effects same way Ares coordination by
water population rating this naturally
that cause your body gently it's a very
safe and reliable in principle allows
the one used in conventional air
conditioners that can easily give you a
call to flip as the major element in
making ever polar we use the specially
developed high-tech evaporative material
it consists of my neural nanofibers
although it has a simple look the inner
structure is complex this material
allowed us to take a fresh look on a
conventional air conditioner and exclude
anything that makes it bulky it was also
very important for us to develop a
material that is not only safe to use
but absolutely eco-friendly propeller
was made to niche from the fees interior
design business the office at home or
any other place evening think of your
personal comfort here finally you can
get to read or things that are
cluttering up your space and control
climate around you by yourself
ever polar is very easy to use all you
need to do is to fill the removable
water tank select the desired power and
relax as you feel cool within a short
time it is noiseless at doesn't vibrate
this will help you to focus on what is
really important for you in today's
world technology can serve people and
simple and invisible things over the
last year we've done a lot making our
way from the idea to the finished
product and now we need your help to
succeed in the next step all you need to
do is to select the pledge and don't
forget to tell your friends about it
join us spread the word enjoy have you
ever forgotten your bike keys or got
annoyed with your bike lock so what if
you didn't need a key to use your bike
lock right you've seen that before but
what if you actually didn't have to do
anything at all and your bike would
still be safe with ID locket we created
the world's first fully automatic bike
lock that does exactly that I lock it
automatically unlocks your bike when
you're in close proximity so you can
just get on it and ride and once you
leave your bike I lock it make sure it's
safe all of this is fully automatic so
you don't have to press any buttons or
struggle with your bulky bike lock with
a locket you can worry less and enjoy
more because that's what bike riding
should be about I locket is built with
strong and durable materials and can be
easily attached to most bikes and II
bikes and if your smartphone runs out of
battery you can easily open I lock it

proximity for locking and unlocking the
I locket app also allows you to easily
and securely share your bike with
friends and family with just a couple of
clicks sharing your bike has never been
easier the search continues for missing
Sacramento man Steve Balkan were signs
of the 37 year-old whereabouts have
failed to come to fruition steve was
reported missing six days ago by his
wife Mary who earlier today issued this
following statement I just hope more
than anything that Steve is being looked
after Steve if you can hear me honey
wherever you are please just come home
steve is having the time of his life and
that's not just because the sun's out or
the fish are biting it's because the
problems that came with camping have now
been solved that's thanks to the
greatest cooler on earth nippy as well
as having the ability to carry up to 70
cans nippy can hold ice for up to a
whopping six days you know that beats
having the cooler flooded by sundown
right yeah you don't need to worry about
no backup generators cuz nippy is smart
it can charge most portable devices with
its four onboard USB ports the battery
can be charged by your car the mains or
even using nippies record-breaking solar
panels bill with waterproof casing and
the most efficient cells in the world
nippy solar panels are so reliable that
even on a cloudy day you won't miss any
crucial updates luckily for Steve the
cup holders have drainage
with wheels that are bigger better and
just more badass than the other cooler
on the market nippy is tough robust
wheels that can handle any terrain and a
body that can withstand a bear attack
nippy's parks are all replaceable though
yeah just in case you're lucky enough to
run into a grizzly the nippy cooler is
the upgrade you've been looking for you
will never need to buy another cooler
again as nippy has been built to last a
life with its sleek innovative design
and all-around rugged durability nippy
captivates you in ways your tired old
quarter was never able to do we've been
working hard the last three years
designing prototyping and testing nippy
now well it's finally ready for
production but we need your help be part
of something smart make a pledge get
lost with nippy hey with these lights
you don't need a campfire and just like
everything else with nippy then go all
night long
so this started about a year ago where
we have to measure the contours of an
organic surface turns out that's a very
hard problem the only available solution
cost twenty thousand dollars and that
that's ridiculous so we set out to build
our own we looked at what was available
out there at the intersection of
computerization and surface measurement
and we couldn't find a single solution
that was compelling the 3d scanners ever
precise gosh tens of thousands of
dollars and the ones that are affordable
one precise level today that changes
we're only just beginning to explore the
possibilities of capturing the world in
3d 3d printing is an amazing tool it
converts a digital file into a physical
object some call it and industrial
revolution the e Ora 3d scanner does the
exact opposite of the 3d print it lets
artists makers and designers captured
objects and surfaces and turn them into
high quality 3d models and use them as
part of the creative process we knew we
had to use a smartphone moeller phones
are simply amazing we use them to take
pictures edit videos update social media
even for gaming the Euro 3d scanner is
powered entirely by your smartphone
using it as easy just open the app and
press scan it'll automatically adjust
focus and exposure and drive a green
laser to scan your object as it sweeps
we take over 1000 photos and analyze
them in real time to give you a 3d model
a typical scan takes three to five
minutes and gives you a full-color mesh
with up to 8 million points with a range
of one meter you can capture objects big
and small accurate to less than 100
microns that's the thickness of a single
sheet of paper we're engineering the
scanner we had one objective in mind
precision all that's possible thanks to
a design that's both beautiful and
machined from a solid block of aluminium
with over 35 million operations we've
designed it to be both robust and
precise the light ring gives you quick
visual feedback and the adjustable knob
let's just secure any module smartphone
the green laser let's just scan in any
lighting conditions as most cameras are
twice as sensitive to green than any
other color for water type models we
also design a Bluetooth turntable it
will sync to your scanner and rotate
your object to make sure you get every
angle we meticulously design every
aspect of the hardware and we've tested
seven different prototypes we've put
together a great team and we've lined up
several manufacturers now we need you to
help us put this together I could not
imagine that a time will come I'll be
able to easily observe all that has
meaning for me it's a dock station I
needed anyways I chose the one that fits
my style thanks to a software I can turn
the camera on no matter how far I am
zetec is really fabulous using it I'm
able to oversee everything that's
happening in my house it's equipped with
intuitive controls my friends
appreciated actually loved it
however one of our friends is slightly
disappointed my wife doesn't miss the
precious moments and no longer worries
about our baby
at my workplace it became irreplaceable
I found out who is stealing my ideas and
exposed his and to be honest we all feel
much better we know our grannies are
okay wow it is so cool and inexpensive
for now though of course there are
things that are rather left unseen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
