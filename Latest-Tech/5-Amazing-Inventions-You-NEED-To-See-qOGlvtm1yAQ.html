connecting to a charger it's the sound
of relief knowing you are still
connected to the world connecting and
disconnecting your phone from a charger
should be a simple seamless task but it
isn't we've all been there
frustrated at our cables for any number
of reasons despite keep book tips
becoming smaller they haven't evolved to
become any easier to connect until now
presenting the future of USB cables ASAP
Connect featuring rare-earth neodymium
magnets with 18 karat gold plating ASAP
Connect will change the way you interact
with your USB devices forever
featuring the world's first reversible
cable on both the phone end and charger
end
it works by inserting the tip to the
phone and the cable magnetizes on to the
tip instantly meaning you can
effortlessly connect when you only have
one hand free or in a hurry to head out
or even in the dark you no longer have
to worry about your devices getting
damaged ASAP connect even helps you
retrieve your phone from hard-to-reach
places we've designed two tips one for
micro USB devices such as Android phones
mini cameras and speakers the other is
for Apple products we've removed the
weakness of your traditional Apple
lightning connector tip which snaps off
easily by combining the tip and base
into one piece we call this the Alpha
connector one of the engineering hurdles
in designing a SAP Connect was its
compact size by condensing the
technology down to the size of a
fingertip we're able to make sure that
it's compatible with all phone cases in
creating a new standard for USB cables
we have performed the most stringent
quality control tests combined with
superior materials to really challenge
the users expectations of what a
state-of-the-art USB cable should be
we've spent the past two years working
closely with one of the world's largest
USB cable manufacturers we're a team of
disruptors from Sydney to LA I believe
that users should be the creators of
products not large corporations seeking
profit over practicality we've created
the final prototypes and delivered
samples to dozens of major tech
publications worldwide through your help
combined with the magic of IndieGoGo we
hope to bring a SAP connect to life and
unleash the future of USB cables today

what kind of a snorer are you
introducing the silent partner the
world's first smart batch to quiet
snoring noise silent partner is a smart
lightweight and compact device that
elegantly tackles what other products
don't the snoring noise the silent
partner creates a silent zone around the
person wearing it giving you and those
around a better night's sleep how does
it work
silent partner uses patented active
noise cancellation that detects the
unwanted snoring sound and generates a
counter sound which suppresses it the
result well it's as simple as a plus and
minus they cancel each other out many of
us have probably been there being around
or creating a synchrony of snoring
noises that create frustrating nights
for us in our problems most learning
products today don't fully solve the
snoring problem
they are often intrusive and disrupt the
quality of sleep so instead of tackling
the snoring we decided to simply find a
solution for the noise using vast
experience with a and C technology and
sleeping experts the silent partner was
designed and developed to be effective
from as close as 20 centimeters away
place on and partner over your nose and
gently adhere it to your face the
hypoallergenic adhesive will secure the
device in place comfortably while you
sleep be one of the first to experience
silent partner and finally give you and
your partner a real silent night

the best input device that was 2007 this

powerful and they're gorgeous but
they're not a perfect input device to
fully express ourselves we need better
precision and more space this is free

there is never be anything like it give
us a minute Mitch Hakim sensor includes
a miniature laser which has a collimated
beam to the surface reflections from the
surface combined with internal
reflections to give us emotion signals
in fact we invented the world's smallest
three-dimensional laser interferometer
that is truly amazing let me take it
from here

stands in the way of your creative
energy it's got a mini touch display for

this is Jeff and this is his exercise
routine
he works hard to build up his cardio and
muscle he also wants to lose weight but
it takes energy and time to burn away
the pounds Jeff would stay in the gym
and continue to fight for weight loss
results but he needs to get to work
imagine if you could take your weight
loss regime home with you to burn
calories long after you've left the gym
now there is a revolutionary technology
that allows you to do just that
introducing the thin ice fest a slick
wearable embedded with cooling
technology that forces your body to burn
extra calories when I first got this
idea I had this bolt of realization that
this could be a game-changer in the
weight loss industry the 1.0 thin ice
vest is ready for the mass market and is
an amazing product that has already
started to help people burn calories as
they lounge around the house but we are
crowdfunding to raise the capital needed
to fund the 2.0 version of thin ice
which is sleeker allowing it to be worn
right under your clothing imagine being
able to take your calorie burning with
you anywhere you go the 2.0 thin ice
vest is comfortable in light weight and
will help you shed pounds even as you
sleep the vest can even wait until you
are in deep sleep before activating so
the technology won't make you cold it
will just make you thinner the thin ice
fest is also discreet enough to be worn
under regular clothing so you can use it
anytime day or night go to bed wake up
leaner how does the thin ice fest help
produce calorie burning using cold
temperatures the body responds by
revving up and burning fat to keep your
blood warm the process is called cold
temperature thermogenesis
that's really ingenious solution
anything that I could just wear day to
day that would help me lose weight would
be an absolute asset there are certain
people out there that we all love to
hate and these are the people who can
eat whatever they'd like to and not gain
any weight and what this product is
actually able to do is give you those
characteristics by speeding up your
metabolism I'm a gamer so having a cheat
code is something I'm all about another
innovative part of the thin ice system
is the Bluetooth connected mobile app it
allows you to adjust the temperature of
the technology to your comfort levels
you can also track the calories you're
burning second-by-second and if you want
to take things to the next level
the app will recommend special diet and
exercise routines to help you lose
weight like a champ

mass market now but thin ice two point O
has vast improvements including a
sleeker design hot-swap rechargeable
batteries and ability to be machine
washed then ice need your generous
support to put this revolutionary
technology into your hands in exchange
