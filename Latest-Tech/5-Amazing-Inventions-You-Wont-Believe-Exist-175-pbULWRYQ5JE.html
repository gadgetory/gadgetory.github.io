the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when asked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product it would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution bringing the gym to you
the platform is strong the posts are
spaced evenly apart on both sides so you
can simulate any exercise movement and
quickly adjust difficulty the base is
made wide enough to stand comfortably
during your workout and we even added a
layer of non-slip material to assure you
stay in place the bands were customized
for this concept and can handle any
height
there's even cloth in the bands to
protect you simply clip in to get
started shorten the bands or add bands
to increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clip from
sliding provided you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
uppers we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight padding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor so you
can increase the workout the body boss
is lightweight made of high-grade
injection molding and capable of
handling hundreds of pounds of force the
underside has non-slip feet for safe use
on any surface the adjustable posts make
for easy storage starting from day one
you can choose your color green pink you
can choose your package and choose how
you want to follow workouts live reflect
program all on your own
normally plus to thousands of dollars to
buy or recreate all of the support but
by backing this kickstarter today you
can get it for a fraction of that price
our hearts and souls have developed the
body boss 2.0 and we're making our first
prototypes to be able to produce the
product and make it available we'll need
your support together we can make this
happen make this a part of your
lifestyle share this video with a friend

possibilities right to our fingertips

push of a button it makes life more
comfortable in every aspect and helps us
prepare better for the future
except when it comes to a flat tire
right ere is the next generation of
effortless air pops and it works at the
push of a button just like you're used
to just as it should right air is clean
simple and efficient it's designed to
help you in two common situations the
natural loss of air pressure that always
catches you off-guard and a flat tire
that stops you from getting on your bike
at all right air is the perfect quick
fix for bone it lets you inflate your
tires with a single push of a button
this way you can take care of a flat
after you get to where you need to be
ride air can be refilled with an air
compressor in literally a second and
it's built in safety prevents air from
leaking out we worked on a slick and
elegant design that would fit perfectly
on your bike so that you're never caught
without it just to be on the safe side
it has a built in lock to keep your ride
air where it belongs and of course ride
air isn't just for riding you can also
use it to inflate lots of other things
high these suckers
my name is here and this is myself we
both share our passion for biking and we
know just how annoying a flat tire can
be so together we created right we spent
the last year designing testing and
creating the next generation of air
pumps and we're ready and eager to move
forward to full production by pledging
and sharing this idea with your friends
you can help us make writer a reality
