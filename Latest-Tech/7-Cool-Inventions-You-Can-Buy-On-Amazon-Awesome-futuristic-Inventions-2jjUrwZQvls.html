boat the coming undone the double
knotting
and the untying to get them off so how
do you really want to put your shoes on
wouldn't it be great if there were no
laces at all
I mean nothing to get in the way well
this is what Zubat they're like when
separated Lubitz eliminate three rows of
laces so there's a huge mouth opening
the complete slide in
then just connect the magnet
and that's it
now go for a run
go to the playground
go to the gym
play some basketball
Lubitz hold securely for most
recreational activities
the Zubaz are not just for athletic
sneakers they're for your everyday
casual shoot with stupid you have a
clean looking shoe no ugly bows and
they'll never come undone how do you
really want to take your shoes off let's
face it most of us do what we are not
supposed to do we step on our heel and
squeeze out of our shoes this wears down
the heel and leaves you with a knot to
untie later but we do this stepping out
of your shoes becomes the right way to
do it the magnets will split and step
out and now your shoe is open and ready
for the next time you want to flip in
Lubitz are not ordinary Magnus they've
been specially engineered to concentrate
the magnetic forces for the space of the
magnet this gives them incredible
folding forces in a small size it's also
means there's almost no magnetism on the
outside of the Zubat where you don't
want
