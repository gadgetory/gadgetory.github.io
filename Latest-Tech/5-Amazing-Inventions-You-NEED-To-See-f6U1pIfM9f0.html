we love the freedom I give us but they
are taking their toll we pump out huge
amounts of carbon spend years of our
lives in traffic and thousands on fuel
but most of us can't just stop driving
or buy a price in your car every time a
more efficient model comes out we need a
way to take any car new or old and get
the most out of it we need go far dhofar
is an intelligent in car device that
empowers you to drive your current car
smarter cutting your time in traffic
your emissions and your fuel use it
works by utilizing the science behind
your car's engine for every engine speed
there's a sweet spot an optimum throttle
position that maximizes your power and
minimizes your fuel consumption it's
where your car runs best driving in the
sweet spot saves fuel which saves money
and cuts emissions but the sweet spot is
different for every engine and unless
you are part of a Formula One race team
it's very difficult to find not anymore
go far find your car's unique sweet spot
and uses real-time feedback to guide you
there the display glows blue when you're
in a sweet spot and red when you're
wasting energy real-time feedback works
and in trials go far cut fuel use by
thirteen to twenty two percent it's easy
to install my seven year old can do it
for an ice cream once installed go far
just works no need to fiddle with your
phone all you need to do is get in and
drive much safer go far analyzes your
actual driving patterns telling you
exactly when to leave the house so you
spend less time in traffic your car I
can't do that in fact it's the most
advanced car computer on the market if
plots you're driving in 3d space and
measures every single Joule of energy in
and out of your car we spend a lot on
our cars and now you know exactly where
it's going to the send it makes tracking
expenses a breeze and unlike your car
computer go far stores all your trip
data for you automatically when
designing the go far product the
challenge was to create a form that
would fit seamlessly into any car
teria it had to effectively communicate
to you while not distracting you while
you drove we've created what we believe
is a beautiful product that will fit
effortlessly into your driving
experience because scoop on measures
you're dragging performance you can turn
driving into a game thief your best
challenge your friends all compete in a
global leagues who's the best you're the
best we've been working on go far for
two years developed powerful new
technologies and built a team of
passionate people but to get go far into
production we need your help by backing
our campaign you get rocket science in
your car you'll save big on your fuel
bill you'll spend less time in traffic
you'll cut your carbon footprint and
you'll have it a smartest car industry
so if you want to be first in the world
to do all this back our campaign and
together we can make it happen
whether you're a novice cook for an
experienced chef things don't always go
as you plan in the kitchen sometimes the
dish turns out undercooked and sometimes
things end up burned simple temperature
control is still an unsolved problem in
the kitchen atmel we want to change that
we want to help people cook the perfect
meal every time we built the MELD knob
clip and app that together make up the
world's first automatic temperature
cooking control system that work with
your existing cooktop and cookware this
is the MELD knob and it's the key to
controlling temperatures the MELD knob
replaces the existing knob on your gas
or electric cooktop
it automatically turns the burner up or
down to keep the food at the perfect
temperature the melt knob knows how to
adjust temperature based on data it
receives from the MELD clip the clip
attaches to the cookware you already own
and continuously measures the
temperature of the food you are cooking
to within less than a degree this is the
MELD app it contains hundreds of chef
tested recipes that will automatically
control the burner and take the
guesswork out of cooking of course you
can make your own recipes or manually
control the knob if you'd like meld
reacts so quickly that as soon as you
add cold food to a pot it knows to turn
up the heat to maintain temperature and
it knows exactly when to turn it down so
nothing overcooks no controls the
temperature while you control the flavor
and meals come out perfectly each time
the MELD knob and clip are ideal for
slow cooking simmering sous vide
poaching crying and even candy making
we're passionate about helping people
make great meals we perfected the
science of cooking and made the MELD
knob and clip the easiest solution to
help you be creative and confident in
everything you cook unlike other
companies that create bulky single
purpose gadgets that clutter your
countertop and force you to learn new
skills we focused on building a product
that works with the things you already
own it's like upgrading your existing
cookware and cooktop our engineers and
designers focused on creating something
simple elegant and above all easy to use
Kickstarter this is where you come in
we've research developed experimented
coded and tested and now we're ready for
mass production we invite you to
pre-order today and be among the first
experience just how easy making a
perfect meal can be
this is snapped it without switching to
a custom app just place your phone on
top and press print a few seconds later
you'll have a beautiful Polaroid photo
of your phone screen snap jet is a slim
portable instant film printer for your
smartphone it's like a tiny photocopy
machine you can bring anywhere the best
thing about snapchat is its simplicity
all you need to do is put your phone on
top press one button and you get a
flawless photo it doesn't need any apps
wires or Bluetooth to function with
snapchat the possibilities are endless
if you can see it you can print it
imagine a birthday card with a selfie
that was taken 30 seconds ago what about
printing a custom business card at your
next meeting snapchats text is sharp and
clear never be caught with an outdated
business card again and next time
instead of running a giant expensive
photo booth for your special occasion
why not use a snapchat instead snapchat
prints on fuji instax or polaroid 300
film and its innovative design can
support any smartphone polar i it is
near and dear to my heart as a
photographer I was just really excited
about working with instant film again
and I loved that snapped at was
incorporating the use of a smartphone
because it's just so convenient to take
photos we wanted something that pushed
the limits of what's possible with
instant film like digital effects
fluorescent ink a pocket video that
doesn't require a single battery
lenticular film and transparencies that
come to life with an arduino and some
simple leds we're actually really
excited to see what people make with
snap jet and where it's used so the
biggest challenge with snapchat was
creating a really slim device we
designed something that takes what would
normally be a lens space of about 150
millimeters and squash it down into just
one millimeter we reached out to David
Welker and paradigm optics we specialize
in all polymer
devices the fiber-optic array is the
main component of the snap jet scanning
mechanism making the custom order for
snapchat was challenging because they
were material combinations that we had
never done before it basically required
a reconfiguration of the entire oven
make it work we did all of our
prototyping in-house we use laser
cutting machining and even a kickstart a
3d printer to produce our first
prototypes once we get funding will have
the resources to create our injection
mold tooling will be able to produce our
printed circuit boards and large
quantities and we'll be able to assemble
our devices snapchats hardware and
software will all be open sourced we're
going to release our PCB schematics our
CAD designs and anything else that a
maker would need to hack reprogram and
make it better one day we envisioned
snapchats optical technology and a
printer so slim that it could be part of
a smartphone case snapchat is an amazing
creative tool it's a great way to
connect to preserve memories and it's
really fun by backing snap jet you're
backing the idea that innovation should
be open to everyone an instant film
technology pioneered by the iconic
Polaroid company in 1948 still has a few
surprises in store for us now we really
need your help on Kickstarter to back
our project and make snapchat a reality
and we won't stop until it's in your
hands join us in revolutionising instant
film
