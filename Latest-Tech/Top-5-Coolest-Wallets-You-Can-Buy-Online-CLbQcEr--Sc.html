have to be honest I was eager to play
this game there are three suits three
distinct suits each with a story all
their own but they say the game had
originally started with one the first
deck was made entirely from the
minimalist the next two suits are new to
the game and their arrival at the table
is what's hit the scales for me when I
saw how these additions extended the
pure utility obsessed ethos of the
original minimalist I was convinced it
was time to raise my own stakes dealing
that brings us to the accomplice or
capacity the accomplices signature is a
clipped corner bevel like a corner
crimped ace zipper detail ensures you
can crack the seal quick and lock up
smooth like you're never there that kind
of access to the main cavity means your
beans don't spill never and with the
cash strapped shifted to the interior
you can survey your cards or cash
undercover away from prying eyes
the accomplice carries and conceals more
than cash and credit your bet can extend
to include the calling cards of every
mark at the table now it can even wrap
around the hotel room key and a good
luck charm and the receipts for both
you're not being compound GameDay all
this adds up to a full house of caring
sort shuffle options depending on how
tight you want security for any given
item some neighbors appetite is a strong
suit for players who like to keep their
options open accomplices spread includes
the best premium 100% full grain Italian
leathers I'll stitch it up with high
tenacity Serra Phil same space thread
they use on Tesla's and finally we can
shuffle in The Diplomat until this if
you wanted to take the play
international you were stuck with
useless sleeves loaded wall cases or
long unwieldy travel organizers nothing
this discreet has ever made it to the
tables outer access is smart and
low-profile used for temporary staging
of any and all travel documents tickets
passport immigration forms the inner
pockets are scaled for travel cards or
transit passes with carefully calculated
access angles creating phased measures
of security depending on what's needed
and how
things need to be at hand passport
itself slides gracefully from outer
pocket to the main cavity to the tender
embrace of an internal cash-strapped and
foreign currency can be tucked in there
to the arsenal of simple systems share
the same DNA as the minimalist their
mental but the flexibility they create
when taking your game over national
borders and through other time zones is
maximum there I was I'd taken on the
roles of both dealer and player the
hands had all been delts and each one
like face up across the table like a
promise of things to come like an
invitation to new adventures or
confirmation to grab the one you're
already on with both hands although they
represent a modest kind of vote they
volunteer as accomplices to anyone
daring mighty things and after all that
who ends up the winners in this new game
that's the catch anyone can win like
risk addicts and the British SAS like to
say he who dares wins I like that he who
dares wins so for now and always
I carry forward and invite anyone I meet
to do the same
my father
