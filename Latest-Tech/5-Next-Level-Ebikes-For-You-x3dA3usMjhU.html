latest tech here bringing you you
guessed it the latest tech out there
today five Puli bikes octavo scoots full
disclosure here I'm not really a bike or
scooter type person but some of these
e-bikes are making me take a second
glance at them from how cool they are
octavo and many of these bikes on this
list have the amazingly convenient
feature of folding up pretty easily
making them very portable and very space
efficient making them a strong option
for everyday travel and on top of that
it's no slouch either with a strong
1,000 watt motor reaching 30 kilometers
or 18.5 miles per hour
for our American viewers with
nonfunction tires - it's amazing that
the act Evo is so light at 13 kilos that
you can just take it up to the office
with you
it even has fast chargers like the ones
we see on some of our new smartphones
fully charging its lithium battery in
two to three hours from empty with the
ability to monitor its progress on its
app I found it on IndieGoGo calm in
space grey or arctic white for $485 us
but it's still in production so you'll
have to wait a bit converse cycle on to
our first proper ebike the converse
cycle a funny name but very fitting as
you can see it's a two-in-one City and
cargo bike letting you fold and unfold
between a regular sized bike that is
easy to maneuver around the city with a
longer cargo bike with room for a
maximum of sixty kilos or 130 pounds of
stuff you might end up needing or baby
it has a nice 250 watt electric motor
with a max speed of 25 kilometers or 15
miles per hour with pedal assist as well
it's also on IndieGoGo calm for $13.99
euros with a non e bike version for 300
euros less - this is a great find for
couriers or even bike riders in general
that always face issues when shopping
while riding a bike
now Rica smart ebike if you like stylish
bikes then the nya Rica smart ebike is
for you it has a very sleek carbon-fiber
frame with a max speed of 32 kilometers
or 20 miles per hour all this is thanks
to its strong 500 watt motor with a
high-quality removable lithium battery
that has a charge time of 6 hours
2.5 if you get the fast charge option it
has an inbuilt app for your smartphone
to show you things like speed battery
life light controls for the front-facing
bike lights GPS navigator and a bunch of
other things on top of that this bike is
well built with a ton of features like 2
USB charger ports bike lights hydraulic
disc brakes anti-theft lock full
suspension and a bunch of other things
there are also a few extra add-ons and
upgrades available if you want to like a
1000 watt motor version frame upgrades
extra batteries and better LED displays
it's on IndieGoGo for an even 2,000 for
the best model and full options this is
a pro II bike for those that love biking
and do it for more than just getting
from one place to another s dream in
this day and age the mentality of the
more convenient and connected something
is to my smart device the better brought
us the s dream all-terrain ebike the
smartest in bike out there which just
means that it's the first thing to watch
out for during the rise of the machines
it has an app smart assist hidden
battery compartment a USB ports for
phone's GPS anti-theft protection that
also notifies you right away it's got it
all with a max speed of 32 kilometers or
20 miles per hour thanks to its 750 watt
electric motor with multiple speed
settings to let you paddle as much or as
little as you want
it even has professional front and
middle suspension systems which can
effectively neutral
the vibrations from the whole bite with
the option to install the front
suspension if necessary
it also has live GPS tracking that you
can see on your app while you travel all
over the place to make it even more
convenient it has a two step compact
Boldin which lets it take as little
space as possible for a bike and since
this is an all-terrain bike you can take
it anywhere and it still works being
anti rust and anti dust and even
waterproof as well now this is an e bike
that is also on indiegogo.com and
seriously there's a lot of stuff on
there definitely check it out the best
model of the s dream with full options
will set you back
$12.99 u.s. not a bad deal for the
features it boasts and might be the one
I get if I ever buy a bike since this is
what a modern bike of our day and age
should be convenient connected durable
space and cost-efficient I like it
Leafly ebikes have to stand out now that
there's a lot of competitions and the G
fly bike stands out in an interesting
way yep it folds up in half upright like
a unicycle in a second well that's one
way to stand up I guess max speed on
these is up to 25 kilometers or 15 miles
per hour
with four levels of electric assistance
using a 250 watt motor powered by a
custom lithium very impossible battery
with a recharge rate of four hours best
of all is its belt drive transmission
the belt drive is steel reinforced and
is free of grease and oil it has
bluetooth connection to your smart
devices with its own app Bikefest is
also less of an issue with its
integrated locking system where the bike
detects how far you are from it
it also automatically lights up its
front light and rear bike lights at
to stay unique again I only found it on
their website G fly bike com4 2729 us
which is the priciest of this list but
the most unique looking at least if
you're not a bike person like me then I
hope this crash course into the world of
ebikes piques your interest and gets you
to reconsider since biking is a healthy
activity anyway don't forget to
