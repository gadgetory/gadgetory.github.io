productivity we work from everywhere on
small mobile devices but our desks still
haven't evolved their big cluttered and
uncomfortable until now the edge desk
system is your solution to the way we
work today it's the world's first
integrated desk and chair set that
combines the comfort and focused posture
of a kneeling chair with the versatility
of an adjustable desk surface it sets up
anywhere in less than 10 seconds and
folds down to less than 6 inches to
allow for easy storage in an office
corner or studio apartment it's designed
to be a single piece right out of the
box and adjusts in five different ways
to fit all body shapes and sizes sitting
at the edge will put you right into
productivity mode improving your posture
and keeping you focused I work for
myself so a lot of the times I'll be
going to coffee shops you're colder in
spaces simply because my desk at home is
a little messy and cluttered I tend to
sit slouched over on a regular desk and
with this I feel like my posture is
amazing as an artist this is kind of a
game changer you know it's an easel it
could be a table and it's totally
portable so I could take it to part-2
mark came to us with the coolest idea
and a really tough challenge we needed
to create something as comfortable as a
kneeling chair that would take up less
space than a standard desk and chair
it's very important to keep the desktop
clear so we created this edge all the
way around the desk to hold all the
accessories I'm Mark creator of the edge
I see people working everywhere I go
libraries coffee shops my daughter and
her friends work anywhere they can on
campus because their room is so small
people are uncomfortable and they can't
focus
we knew there had to be a better way
we've tested the best with hundreds of
people to make a comfortable productive
and versatile it's amazing to see
people's response the first time they
sit
now we want to bring the edge to your
studio dorm room home or office over the
past 25 years
our team has been lucky enough to bring
to market hundreds of your favorite
products you've changed how you're
working and now we're changing how we
work if you value productivity comfort
and mobility we hope you'll join us on
the edge
my first impression of the tick wise
tool is it fits great and it looks good
on my wrist each little point that you
touch it's very specific and I like how
it goes from being a traditional type
function looking down at it to really
being able to interact with it my first
impression was that it was a neat watch
but outside of that I didn't really know
that I'd explore the functionality or
get to use it in the real world
normally I wouldn't consider answering
any phone calls while I'm riding my bike
but with the tick watch - you just flip
your wrists twice answer the call
flip another two times and hang it up it
tracks my workouts and it fits with my
lifestyle I'm not really what you call
tech savvy but the tick watch tubes been
really easy to use
okay Tico we want sushi I can ask it to
find a nearby restaurant and it shows
the rating and the review and how far
away it is whenever I want to go for a
run I can always track all of my fitness
goals on it it's really important for me
to be able to track how I want to do my
workout if I want to use it by calories
or with distance or based on my heart
rate I was really impressed with how
convenient it was the scheduled tasks to
meetings responded my voice commands
very easily okay to go schedule a
meeting with Bob Williams for 7:00 a.m.
tomorrow I thought was pretty awesome
that you call an uber by just saying :
Eber into your watch and it would
request one for you it's great to be
able to focus on the tasks I had at hand
instead of having to check my phone all
the time I receive the texts I simply
glance at my watch I can dismiss it
until I'm ready to reply later you know
I don't see how I've really been able to
function without it it's really helped
me be more efficient it's made my life a
lot easier when it comes to my workouts
or even just my daily life okay Tico
how's the weather when I'm selecting a
watch it actually matters to me how it
looks it's cute I like it overall I was
really impressed with the take walks -
it's fast it's intuitive it recognizes
my voice faster than the other
SmartWatch I've ever seen so I get to
keep this right
you
presenting patching right revolutionary
permanent easy this is how it works
locate the puncture with our leak
detector bubbles form showing you where
the puncture is
next pinch your tyre and insert the
patch and ride tool in a twisting motion
pull the slider back then move it
forward to its original position at this
point the patch has been inserted pull
the tool out and pump air in the tyre
here's how the innovative technology
works on the inside of the tire pinch
the tyre to create a gap between the
inner tube and the tyre you will now see
how the patch is inserted and lace on
the top of the inner tube
the thin rubber stem confirms that the
patch was successfully placed add air
and you are ready to continue your ride
I've been a firefighter for almost 20
years now in the captain for the past
four and sadly I've attended calls where
we've had fire deaths and almost always
it's related to smoke or toxic gases we
fight fires but it's smoke that kills
saver is an emergency breath system that
has the power to save many lives most of
us have smoke alarms but what happens
after they go off how do we protect the
ones we love we've created this product
with one purpose to save lives saver is
the first personal home safety device
designed to prevent the inhalation of
smoke and toxic gases during a fire
allowing you and your family the time
you need to escape safely seven people
die every day from home fires 80% of all
fire fatalities are due to smoke
inhalation for every minute you were
trapped in a fire
your survival rate decreases seven to
ten percent and after the first five
minutes your chances of survival are
less than 25% unfortunately people have
a false sense of security when it comes
to dealing with a house fire people
don't realize they have as little as two
minutes to escape a burning home before
it's too late
also people don't realize the long term
health implications from a house fire
inhaling smoke and toxic gases can cause
cancer and other respiratory diseases
the saver emergency breath system has
the power to change all of that
saver is easy to use and can be
activated within five seconds simply
remove the plastic cover apply the nose
grip remove the orange cap bite into the
mouthpiece and breathe normally
for children we recommend they hold
their nose with one hand and breathe
with the mouthpiece savers triple filter
technology removes smoke and dust carbon
monoxide secondhand smoke and toxic
gases with every breath you take saver
includes a powerful LED flashlight with
a built-in alarm the flashlight is
designed to penetrate heavy smoke while
the alarm notifies others on scene to
your location saver is the only
household product of its kind in North
America we believe that saver will
become as common as smoke detectors and
just as important to the safety of your
family lives are depending on this
product getting out there and we need
your help
every saver is a life join us and let's
create a safer home for the people we
