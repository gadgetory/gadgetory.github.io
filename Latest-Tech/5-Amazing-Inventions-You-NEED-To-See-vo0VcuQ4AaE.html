600 million people who get behind the
wheel of bakers every single day at
seventy-five percent of them used very
smart phone while driving hello
kick-started my name is Ivan and today
I'm extremely proud to introduce
Hardwick was it is a simple smartphone
accessory but turns your smartphone into
head-up display just like in a fighter
jet or luxury car would be working on
improving safety and comfort of a driver
for three years
we started with an irrigation app which
transforms our vision how hung cell
phones can be used in cars by now over 1
million drivers have tried our and one
customer even told us it's saved his
life
how do we glass was inspired by rally
racing when you are driving 120 miles
per hour all your attachments focus on
the road ahead look away even for a
second is extremely dangerous putting a
head-up display in the race car is one
thing but we realized regular drivers
face all the same distractions and more
using their smart phones while driving
we put it to the test the two most
common distractions are reading
directions of your phone and checking
your speedometer this causes to drive
blind for approximately 300 feet on
every mile on a typical 10-mile trip we
are distracted and driving blind for
over half a mile using hardware glass
this distraction time is reduced to
nearly zero the head-up displays and
cars do exist already but they tend to
be very expensive and usually found only
on luxury vehicles some companies are
developing more affordable devices but
they still cost several hundred dollars
and a stack in the midst of a very long
and complicated development process so
you still cannot buy them today an odd
way we take a simple and round let's
face it your smartphone already has
everything you need to project data on
which you bacon bright display GPS
internet sensors the only thing is
missing is a special optical glass to
providing high quality reflection of
your screen they are night rain or shine
well the only thing missing is in listen
anymore
imagine that you already have had a
display in your car all you need is just
an accessory for your smartphone imagine
all navigation information is in front
of your eyes all the time imagine music
control conference calls or catching up
with a robot friend Siri there are no
limits you can use any app on any
smartphone that supports head-up display
mode now there's no need to take your
hands of the wheel or your eyes of the
road it's a safer and more comfortable
right what do you think about that
I feel like I'm in a sci-fi movie wow
it's really cool i like it i like the
reflection and it doesn't block your
view of anything it'd actually be give
me the option to just not have to look
down on my phone every two seconds you
know there's a lot of I am luxury cars
that have the capability and if you
don't have one of those kind of cars and
you know thanks great to have it's
convenient it's easy to use it sounds
like it even save lives without having
to take your eyes off the road how much
do you think it costs oh gosh I don't
know it must be some kind of fancy glass
maybe a few hundred dollars actually
only 49 come on seriously $49 then you
have cheaper than my cell phone case I
want one that's awesome that's cool
other glass isn't starting very dear
face and it's not a formula in fact
we're ready manufacturers first there's
a bunch of the devices and get great
feedback for my customers drivers and
marketing experts now it's your turn
Kickstarter help us thank this product
of an ax level and n destructive driving
put it on down and let Holloway glass
show you the way
you
you
there's nothing better than a hot meal
in the great outdoors however creating a
good meal from a portable grill can be
difficult and time-consuming problems
range from not enough heat from a gas
grill or controlling the heat of
charcoal neither system is a great
solution we want the temperature control
you get from a gas grill but the
superior heat of charcoal we have the
solution the velocity grill if you're
into camping tailgating boating rving
picnicking or just want to prepare for
an emergency you're going to love this
grill the velocity grill uses just a few
pieces of flavored hardwoods to generate
temperatures up to a thousand degrees in
minutes unlike other grils the velocity
grill uses a small yet powerful fan the
fan is encased in our stay cool non-slip
base the secret to the power is in our
specially designed reverse fan blade
that allows maximum airflow with very
little noise the fan is powered by three
D batteries plugging into the wall
outlet or cigarette lighter it also has
an optional solar powered battery pack
which allows the grill to be a great
emergency cooking source our heat
diffuser plate spreads heat evenly
across the cooking surface dramatically
reducing cold spots you get with other
grils this plate also preserves heat in
windy conditions by removing the
diffuser plate the grill becomes a
boiler that can heat water or hot
chocolate in no time winter camping or
high elevation won't hinder the velocity
grills performance want to give the kids
an at-home adventure they'll love gather
the family and friends for an evening of
hotdogs and smores to create fun
memories the grill heats up and cools
down quickly making it the perfect
tailgating and picnicking grill
wherever your adventurous site takes you
the velocity grill will make it a tasty
trip we've done a lot of field testing
and we are confident the grill is ready
to go into production our team of
engineers and designers have created
what we feel is the most versatile
portable grill design on the market the
velocity grill is lightweight and
incredibly powerful the secret is in the
wood the smoke flavor you get with the
wood is the same smoke flavor that makes
bacon taste so good but to make this a
reality we need your help to meet our
manufacturers tooling costs and the
minimum order we've created some great
rewards and hope that you'll share this
link with your family and friends and
hope to hear about your adventures with
the velocity grill
project shadow is bringing back the
ultimate outerwear to Kickstarter this
time we redesigned and took our
windbreaker to the next level for people
with innovative minds we needed a jacket
that was super lightweight and
weatherproof yet keeps you dry with
maximum visibility for safety this
jacket is packed and ready for any
occasion and has a fashion-forward
design for the urban outdoors we call it
the ultimate loom inject these
weatherproof high visibility jackets are
specially designed for travelers
commuters or anyone who wants to make
their travel beyond ordinary based on a
feedback from our backers we designed
our loom and jacket to provide maximum
visibility in low light condition to
keep commuters safe we've made upgrades
to existing features such as adding
mesh-lined bends on the chest and back
for maximum airflow an invisible back
pocket with a larger eight and a half
inch opening on side seam to keep your
essentials an elastic cuff and hem band
for more comfort and flexibility a
larger hood to give you extra coverage
in harsher weather in front pockets that
are finished with water-resistant
zippers to keep your belongings dry
we've made multiple prototypes tested
materials improve the fit and explored
every aspect it creates the ultimate
lumen jacket
packed with new features the ultimate
lumen jacket gives you total control
with an added earphone outlet inside the
left chest you can now listen to music
with these earphones locked in place
we've also added a detachable patch with
magnets to easily hold your earphones we
came up with three jackets that will fit
any need first the ghost made with a
special fabric that absorbs the light
and glows in dark second the olympian
made with flash reflective fabric so you
will always be seen in the city streets
third the shadow made from fully water
repellent materials to always keep you
dry in the harshest conditions we wanted
to create a jacket that was practical
and functional to make it accessible to
everyone at an affordable price to do
that we are skipping the middleman and
offering it to you our backers

on your next camping expedition or just
on your regular commute the lumen jacket
is the most versatile jacket on the
market we need your help in making this
project become a reality so take your
performance the next level and support
the ultimate lumen jacket hello my name

celebrate the day when technology caught
up with my dreams to make the world a
safer place for everyone in two thousand
I was attacked by a complete stranger he
cut my throat open my stomach up three
times into my heart area it happened in
a safe neighborhood in the light of day
200 feet from the police station I
fought for life with what I had tooth
and nail but what actually saved me was
the call for help 16 years ago I heard
few options so I used my voice I was
extremely lucky the help came to me
and being alive is all the difference
since that day I've been thinking if
anything could have kept me away from
bad experience sound uneasy and smart to
save lives and give a warm feeling that
you and your loved ones are safe and
sound at long last there is one this
isn't him the ring with the panic button
to send an alert to friends people
nearby police and private security
services put just a touch of them when
an emergency simply push the button the
message with you map coordinates

of suspicion threat or direct danger

always know when they need your help if
they're in emergencies including fires
floods robbery armed attacks sexual
assault or health problems

an alert

without knowing

device and then look at it to find the
button you don't be there they had to be
free you don't need to have a long
conversation with the 91 on a crater
