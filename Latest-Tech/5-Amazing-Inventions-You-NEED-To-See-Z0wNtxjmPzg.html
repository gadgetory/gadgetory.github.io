before heard that sleep is important or
that we spent a third of our life in bed
but quality sleep is rarely what we need
and it seems harder and harder to
achieve these days what if your pillow
could be an active participant in your
sleep rather than just a dumb rectangle
what if your pillow could help you fall
asleep
who could analyze your sleep
intelligently wake you up or even react
to when you snore here we believe a
pillow should do that that's why we
invented Zeek the world's most
sophisticated pillow the easiest way to
think about what Zeek does is to walk
you through how you would use these
before you go to bed you'll open up the
z cap you're gonna set your alarm answer
a few optional questions about your day
even choose what kind of music you want
to listen to Zeek will wirelessly stream
your favorite music whether it's iTunes
Spotify or some of the included sleep
tracks to eight precision placed
speakers inside once your sleep timer
goes off Zeek starts monitoring and
analyzing your sleep as well as
listening for snoring
if Zeek detects you're snoring too loud
it'll subtly vibrate to encourage you to
change sleep positions additionally when
it's time to wake up is equal vibrate
again to make sure you wake up exactly
when you wanted to but what's really
neat is with our smart wake feature
since we're already analyzing your sleep
we can tell if you should wake up a
little earlier than your alarm
I needed music to fall asleep at night
but my wife needs absolute silence so
one night I took apart a pair of
wireless headphones and shoved them
inside my pillow and to my surprise I
was able to hear the music but my wife
wasn't I knew his own to something so I
began to figure out how I could make
this pillow better zieks packed with
amazing innovations and technology in
order to make all of this happen we use
eight speakers inside of Z so the
sleeper can experience their sleep
playlist no matter how they lay on their
pillow Zeek also features a 3-axis
gyroscope to analyze motion and
three-dimensional space um this is going
to allow for detailed analysis of your
sleep the microphone in Z is so
sensitive it can determine to the
decibel level how loudly your snoring
if you do begin snoring Zico used its
vibration motors to gently nudge you to
encourage you to change sleep position
you can wake you up either at your set
alarm time or using smart wake wake you
up
based on your sleep cycle all the xik
settings can be personalized to your
specific sleep needs in the app anytime
we went through many different component
designs to come up with a pillow that
was not only smart and sophisticated but
also incredibly comfortable for the
sleeper comfort is one of the most
important aspects when choosing a pillow
and as we tested various fabrics for the
outer cover of Zeke we found that
tensile was the perfect choice we spent
the last two years making Zeke out
favorite pillow and it's nearly ready
for you all the hard work is being done
the prototypes finalized the supplies
are lined up we just need your help to
start mass production please help us
bring Zeke to you thank you for your
support this is a bike this is the most
perfect design of the last 100 years and
this is your bike
