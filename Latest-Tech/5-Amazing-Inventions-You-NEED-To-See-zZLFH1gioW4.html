hi I'm Oscar and I'm Dave and were the
founders of symbol symbol is a monthly
subscription service that delivers an
orange box to your doorstep each box
contains components and instructions to
build a specific kind of device a fun
toy or something useful our learning app
has step-by-step tutorials to help you
build what's inside the kit from scratch
symbol is for anyone who considers
themselves maker for kids it can be for
high school or college student a young
programmer who wants to get into
hardware it could be a parent who may be
an engineer who has kids wants to create
that nice bonding experience of creating
something from scratch we're going to be
for retired engineer people want to be
creative but they don't always have the
right project ideas the right components
or even the knowledge to build
everything all together so what we do is
we we bring that to you in one package
basically so it's convenient for you to
get started right from home
so our first kid is a a little robot
basically so it's got 16 parts it's
gotten motors wheels a little platform
Wi-Fi module if you go on our website we
have a companion learning app to take
you through how to build the broken so
we have videos and pictures photos gifts
all that kind of thing to guide you
through how to learn to solder how to
put it put the robot together how to
program it and how to program in android
and iOS app so that you can control the
robot from your phone your tablet or any
other device I've been quoting for many
years and I love to create cool things
by writing code so when I discovered
symbol I got to learn how hardware and
software work together and I got to play
with Arduino and raspberry pi robots and
I think this experience in working with
the hardware and software is great for
quarters and developers so when you
skill level I was fortunate enough to
meet Oscar David earlier this year
through Megan Smith I house CTO they
told me about what they're trying to do
and it really resonated with me because
that the Boys and Girls Clubs about
lower we're trying to bring 21st century
skills like coding and engineering to
our members
if people want to learn electronics they
can buy a variety of kids out there I
think that's one of the problems is that
people are overwhelmed by the number of
kids that are out there and there's
nothing really offering a guided path to
learn we've been working on this project
for almost a year we've developed our
hardware and our software prototypes now
all we need is your help to make this
project happen we're finally at a point
where we have our prototype kits ready
to be manufactured but there are a few
steps that we need to take care of
before we get to that point sourcing the
parts shipping fulfillment and they're
quite a few things I need to be done and
we won't be able to do that without the
right amount of capital so we're using a
Kickstarter to basically make that a
reality for some people this would be
the first robot they have ever made and
we really hope that this will inspire
you to make more things in the future
our biggest goal is to teach people
electronics get them to a point where
they feel confident building their own
projects without a simple kit I think
the day that they are able to do that I
think
