we developed this product for people
with an active lifestyle though to carry
a backpack those who ride subway those
who ride their bike commuting to work
those who are adventurous growing up in
Colorado I found the real passion for
the natural world I want to live healthy
I want to eat healthy I want to have
that food with me all the time we've
made a reusable container that you can
take everywhere with you it's super
convenient it's wonderful to have and
it's worth its weight when you carry
around the majority of trash that I
create is from food waste wax cardboard
styrofoam plastic things that get thrown
away it's all packaging I want to do
everything I can to prevent the natural
world from being stuffed with trash what
does it mean to live in a world where
we're conscious about the way we create
waste there are ways to reduce it we
developed a product that doesn't break
easily is dishwasher safe and food safe
is approved by all the science
foundations for food and it can clip
easily to your backpack so it makes it
highly portable it holds 33 ounces
that's a big enough meal for any size
and shape I look forward to how
convenient it can be to have home-cooked
food anywhere
I tried at first carrying food in for
instance Tupperware I constantly look
around for a container that won't leak
and none of them fit that bill they
always have some amount of liquid coming
out of them the green traveler allows
you to carry delicious healthy food with
you
you can pack any food you want or
non-food items it won't leak it will
keep water out and you have four
compartments to choose from you get to
experience home-cooked food from
anywhere anyone who packs lunch for the
day needs a way to do that without
creating wait the green traveller is
food safe dishwasher safe liquid tight
and you can clip it to your backpack we
see this as the most convenient way to
carry food with you students can take it
to college adults can take it to work it

other items as well first aid supplies
mothers can pack all the things their
baby might need go to a food truck or
hot bar without generating any more
wasteful packager we're providing a
solution for healthy and sustainable
lifestyles
welcome to Lite back the NTSF
solar-powered backpack that keeps your
phone charged and your stuff safe let's
check it out the 21st century has
redefined a way that we live our lives
you're no longer tied to an office 37
percent of US workers say they work from
home in the past month that's up over
400% since 1995 I'm pretty sure that
your phone's been upgraded consent and
it's time that your bag was to give life

ever worried about your bag getting
stolen or broken into do you have a hard
time keeping organized well lucky for
you

start with why you're never gonna have
to deal with a dead phone again the
solar bank is a removable unit which has
a solar panel and battery with enough
power to charge an iPhone 6 up to 12
times you can charge the silver bank
through USB then when you're out in the
vet the solar panel keeps the power
topped up the solar bank also has
built-in Bluetooth speakers so you have
great sounding audio with you when
you're on the
life back has an integrated lock this
means you can lock the liver shut when
you're on the go and what's really cool
about this lock is you can actually lock
the bag to something when you're sitting
still because of the unique design of
the zippers you can also lock a zipper
shut while locking it to a fixed point
the bottom of the cable can not be
removed and the exit point is reinforced
so it's super strong also the end of the
lock works use a bottle opener
Cheers salud some things go the work
zone is incredibly organized there's a
separate section for your laptop iPad
there's a space for your wallet there's
a key hook business cards and there's
also a section for loose papers and a
separate pocket so you don't lose
receipts in the light zone is a
protected pocket for your sunglasses as
room for clothes and any of your
non-work stuff because you don't want
your onions falling out into work
because we all know that map is that
just me that's happened to there are 4
hidden compartments on the back on your
shoulder straps or two pockets these are
big enough for credit cards travel cards
for the subway or Metro cash loose
change or even your headphones press up
to your back or two more hidden pockets
these are ideal for your passport and
boarding card web travel these pockets
are even big enough for an iPhone 6 plus
and on one side there's a USB plug that
connects to the fotomat so you can
charge your phone enough while you're on

time we can take the power bank with you
on the move just unplug it and slip it
into your pocket the two entrances each
