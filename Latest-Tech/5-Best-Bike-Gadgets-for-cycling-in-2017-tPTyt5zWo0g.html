cyclists safety always comes first as
crazy cycling fans we understand all the
problems that you may or have already
encountered during your ride
that's why we made the live all bling
helmet the smartest bicycle helmet for
safety live all has many features that
can simplify your ride and keep you safe
the LED outline lights on top of the
helmet will make you stand out in the
night while the taillights will indicate
directions for your fellow teammates
never worry about falling behind anymore
find the shiny helmets and you will find
the team the built-in Bluetooth speaker
and mic enable you to take phone calls
or communicate with teammates directly
using the walkie-talkie function and of
course you can listen to music with
bling helmet and cycle to the beats if
the built-in gravity sensor senses an
internal strike SOS signals will be
displayed on the helmet in emergency
contacts will be alerted automatically
we call this multifunctional
remote-control bling J it can simply be
mounted on the bike and is very easy to
use bling jet will connect to both your
phone and bling helmet so you can use it
to control the lights on the helmet use
the walkie-talkie take incoming calls or
play your favorite songs beside that we
designed a live all phone holder so you
can easily take your phone the phone
holder also contains a battery so it can
also be used to charge your phone
no more running out of power during your
rides the best part of the live all
products is the live all riding act
it's compatible with different wearable
devices to measure and display different
parameters of your body or your eye
it measures slope rate gradient altitude
cadence speed etc and shows the stats
directly on your phone
we've also invented the live all Nano
cadence sensor the smallest single unit
cadence sensor in the world besides
analysing your ride the live all riding
app can also be used to take photos or
shoot short videos by processing the
photo taking button on bling jet with
all this awesome looking data and
fantastic photos or videos will help you
to map your unique Road book and share
on social media platforms
imagine if vertical bike parking would
suddenly become simple a bike parking
solution that would lift your bike for
you wouldn't require physical strength
and would save floor space it's all
possible and it is here it's parkus how
it works
drive in the front wheel when the wheel
is fixed hold the saddle to lead the way
and let parkus do its job
to remove the bike just grab the saddle
and pull firmly towards yourself many
bike enthusiasts face a problem a lack
of storage space all the available by
parking devices that solve this issue
require great physical effort so parkus
was invented as a solution blaze is a
damn good LED front light but it also
projects the symbol of a bike than on to
the road ahead it tackles one of the
biggest causes of cyclist fatalities
being caught in a blind spot or vehicles
turning across an unseen bike it warns
drivers in front of the cyclist of its
presence and prevents them turning
across its path imagine being a bus
driver with a bike down in a blind spot
you can't see even lit up like a
Christmas tree the bike can be invisible
but with blaze you see its image on the
road in front before you decide to turn
I could see that green light first it
tells me something's there
then I'll see the cyclist so that when
he's in my blind spot will point him out
two or three seconds before I actually
see is it could possibly 50% saving his
life another common scenario sees
drivers pulling out of a side Junction
into the path of a bike here the seconds
can be right out close but overlooked
deuter's position lasers flashing symbol
ahead of the bike increases its
visibility and gives it a presence away
from its normal footprint
finally pedestrians i've often at the
jam on the brakes to avoid hitting
someone who stepped out through
stationary traffic be one of the first
to get a blaze on your bike and blaze a
trail built in the UK and assembled by
hand with beautiful machined aluminium
casings the internals comprised leading
optical engineering with the chargeable
lithium battery super-bright white LEDs
and a green laser module the lens that
disperses the lasers highly focused
light to create an image also spreads
its energy and make it safe to human
eyes like a laser pointer it needs to be
handled with care it has a magnetic
safety sensor meaning it cannot be used
off the bike
but the LEDs can still be used on low
power as a torch this feature also
prevents it draining the batteries in
your oxic it's durable it's compact and
it's waterproof
why don't many cyclists use locks
they're too heavy too cumbersome too
bulky and not designed for those people
who really want to ride their bikes auto
lock is an all-new cinch lock for both
cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts who
value their gear and need a small safe
and lightweight solution for their
lifestyle it's far more secure than a
cable lock and much lighter than a you
lock in your saddlebag in your pocket or
anywhere on your bike auto lock is so
lightweight you won't even know you were
carrying it auto lock is very secure
because of an engineer design that uses
multiple layers of high temper 18
millimeter wide stainless steel bands
coated and scratch resistant santoprene
and reinforced with kevlar making it
extremely cut resistant conventional
theft tools like wire or bolt cutters
alone are just not enough to cut the
auto lock auto lock also has more uses
beyond bicycles but for example ski and
snow tools and sheds camping gear water
sports and more the possibilities with
auto lock are limitless the auto lock
weighs under 115 grams and coils to
under three inches in diameter making it
easy to pack and store on the bike in
pockets backpacks purses or jerseys in
comparison you locks or chains are 10 to
20 times heavier than auto lock and much
more difficult to carry the cinching
function keeps your gear locked tight
we've designed auto lock with three
resettable combination deals and a
durable aluminum head the auto lock
comes in multiple colors and is
available in different lengths starting
with the all-around 30 inch version
which offers the most versatility auto
lock also comes in a super compact 18
inch pro ride version and a 60 inch
extended version the 18 inch pro ride
version is intended for cyclists on the
go offering the fastest coil times the
lightest weight the most bike storage
options and just enough length to cinch
your bike up to any polar post up to 5
inches in diameter in second
like tree crazy whirlwind
from my corners
reached out
waiting for
feel your energy when our eyes touch so
familiar deep inside like you were
already
made me see the world and
crazy till I reach down I saw y'all
Oh
today
tonight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
