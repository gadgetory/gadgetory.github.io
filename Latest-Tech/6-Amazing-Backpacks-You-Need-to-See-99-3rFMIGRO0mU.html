about this lock is that you can actually
lock the bag to something when you're
sitting still because of the unique
design of the zippers you can also lock
the zipper shut while locking it to a
fixed point the bottom of the cable can
not be removed and the exit point is
reinforced so it's super strong also the

pickpocket incidents occur every day
around the world and these are just the
reported numbers in the Metro a lot of
commuters use this goofy way of wearing
day bags in the front to outsmart the
pickpockets as a solution to this the
Dutch award-winning brand XD design has
come up with a revolutionary zero entry

backpack it's made of an impact
resistant outer shell and L mininum of
stainless steel hardware and it only
weighs 6 kilograms as for the sound

if you faint simply b-bring please
support us we're a couple of young
engineers who like to party and move

why not bring it all together the beat
bringer is made with love from all of us
to all of you who is crazy enough to
bring it we're proud to introduce the
ample smart backpack the world's most
advanced portable charging solution
integrated directly into the fabric of a
bag I think that it should be easier to
charge your phone in your laptop
wherever you are without needing to find
a power outlet my life is lived on the
go I can't keep my laptop charged past
noon my phone needs to be plugged in
before 3 p.m. I must have tried every
portable charging system portable
battery most of them just don't get it
done what I really need is a serious
charging solution that can power
anything anytime anywhere but the
portable charging solution that I needed
didn't exist and I wanted to build it
and when I explained what I wanted to do
to some engineering friends of mine they
wanted to help because they needed it -
we're proud to introduce the ample smart
backpack the portable charging solution
that we needed and we think you might
need - and we're proud to have been
named a 2015 CES Innovation Awards
honoree in two categories a testament to
the engineering rigor that was put into
the development of this product so I've
been designing bags for over a decade
and the challenge here was that the bag
wasn't just holding your devices but you
are also plugging your devices into the
bag for them to be charged I started to
create illustration drawings where I
would then send them to Tomoko and she
would start engineering the housings
around those pieces and then she would
send them back and I would tailor the
bag design around her CAD data our goal
was to create a design that was truly
intuitive for the user and we wanted the
electronics to almost disappear into the
fabrics of the bag the ample smart
backpack can charge all of your devices
overnight or throughout the day
we integrated a powerful custom-built
battery that can recharge a smartphone
two to three times there's a USB port in
every pocket and you can add three
expansion batteries for days that you
need more power the modular batteries
charge rapidly when docked into the bag
but can also be removed and used
separately you can stick in your coat
pocket or your purse and take you to
dinner with you and you don't have to
carry the bag with you to have that
backup power when we first thought about
putting electronics into a backpack we
immediately worried what happens if you
drop it so we added shock absorbers and
an extra layer foam all the way around
and we applied a water-resistant coating
to all of the exterior fabrics to help
keep the rain out have you ever
forgotten your backpack at a coffee shop
the ample smart backpack can alert you
if you do and we built a mobile app that
will monitor battery levels connected
devices and smart sensors in the bag or
you can use the OLED display and touch
sensor to monitor the vitals inside of
the bag without ever opening a zipper
ample is a talented team of designers
and engineers with decades of experience
launching new products more importantly
though we're commuters travelers coffee
shop dwellers and on-the-go doers and we
needed a more ample bag we have a plan
to get into production by early summer
but we need help to get there we're
hoping to raise at least 125 thousand
dollars to cover the cost of tooling and
raw materials and as a thank you to our
early backers we're offering a 25%
discount on the bag and all of the
accessory modules please support us in
bringing the ample smart backpack to
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
